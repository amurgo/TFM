For the Respondent:    Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Malawi and was born on 25 July 1985.

 2.  This  is  an  appeal  by  the  appellant  against  the   determination
    promulgated on 4 August 2014 of First-tier Tribunal Judge  North  which
    refused his Article 8 ECHR appeal.

 3. The background to this matter is that the appellant came to the  UK  on
    24 October 2006 as a student. His leave  as  a  student  was  until  31
    January 2010. His mother and four younger siblings came to the  UK  not
    long after the appellant. He was granted further leave to remain  as  a
    post-study worker until 8 December 2012. He visited Malawi for 6 months
    around 2011/2012, living for some of that  time  with  his  father.  He
    applied for leave to remain on Article 8 ECHR  grounds  on  5  December
    2012.

 4. The first ground of  challenge was that the First-tier Tribunal   judge
    had made a material error of fact when finding that the  appellant  had
    no ties to Malawi and so did not meet  the  private  life  requirements
    contained in paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Immigration Rules.  The  judge
    referred at [6],[7], [8] and [9] of the decision to appellant being  in
    Malawi from 2010 to 2012 when it was his evidence that he had only gone
    there for 6 months. The respondent  conceded  the  error  of  fact  but
    maintained that it was not material where the appellant had spent  most
    of his life in Malawi and visited the country relatively recently.

 5. It was my judgement that the evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    allowed only one conclusion as regards ties to Malawi, that being  that
    the appellant retained real and substantive ties  to  the  country.  He
    lived in Malawi until he was 21, all of his childhood. He has  been  in
    the UK for only 9 years as an adult. He returned to Malawi for 6 months
    in 2011/2012. Even accepting that he is now estranged from his  father,
    it was his evidence in his witness  statement  that  for  part  of  the
    period of his return in 2011/2012 he lived with a "girlfriend" there.

 6. It is simply not arguable that he can be said to have lost all ties  to
    Malawi. His ties are not "remote" or "abstract" where he spent  by  far
    the majority of his life there, all of his childhood, returned there in
    2011/2012 and had links there at that time outside of his  family,  for
    example the "girlfriend". Where he could not establish  that  paragraph
    276ADE (vi) was met, the First-tier Tribunal's error of fact as to  how
    long he spent in Malawi in 2011/2012 cannot be material.

 7. The grounds are misconceived in suggesting that the First-tier Tribunal
    did not conduct a second-stage Article 8 assessment or  assess  whether
    the appellant had a family  life  with  his  mother  and  siblings.  It
    clearly did so at [8] to [10].

 8. The grounds amount only to disagreement with the finding at [8] and [9]
    that the appellant had not shown that he had  a  family  life  for  the
    purposes of Article 8 with  his  mother  and  siblings.  Three  of  the
    siblings were already adults at the time  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing. The judge took into account,  in  terms,  at  [9]  the  "close
    relationships" the appellant has with his family in the UK and that  he
    has acted as a role model for his siblings. The reasons  given  at  [8]
    and [9] for finding that family life had not been shown  were  entirely
    open to the Judge on the evidence before him. How much weight  and  the
    conclusions he drew from that evidence were a  matter  for  him  unless
    perverse or irrational. The challenge here was not put in those  terms.
    I would have found them to be without merit had they been so.

 9.   I  should  also  point  out  that  the  grounds  were   significantly
    misconceived in relying at paragraph 5 on outdated Upper Tribunal  case
    law.

DECISION

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error on  a
    point of law and shall stand.
