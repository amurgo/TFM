 REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW AND REMITTAL TO THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL



1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department to whom I shall refer as the 'Claimant'.  I shall  refer  to
    the original appellants in the appeal before the First Tier Tribunal as
    the 'appellants'.

2    The  first-named  appellant  was  born  on  20th  October,  1976.   Her
    husband, the second-named appellant was born on 1st August,  1978,  and
    her son, the third appellant was born  on  19th  December,  2009.   The
    second appellant is also the father of  the  third  appellant  and  all
    appellants are nationals of India.

3.   The first appellant originally  entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  28th
    August, 2005, on a visa as a student nurse which was valid  until  10th
    August, 2006.  She then obtained further leave  to  remain  as  a  work
    permit holder until 16th August, 2011.  On 21st July, 2011 she  applied
    for indefinite leave to remain but this  was  refused  on  3rd  August,
    2011.  On 10th August, 2011, the appellant applied for further leave to
    remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and this was subsequently  granted
    to 11th August, 2013.  However  on  27th  October,  2012  the  claimant
    curtailed the first-named appellant's  leave  on  the  basis  that  the
    nursing home where she  had  previously  been  working  had  gone  into
    administration and so  her  job  had  disappeared  and  her  leave  was
    curtailed to expire on 11th March, 2013.   Prior to that date, in  fact
    on 26th November, 2012, the  first  named  appellant  had  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.

4.   The first-named appellant married  the  second-named  appellant  during
    her period of leave as  a  work  permit  holder  and  the  second-named
    appellant was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom in 2008,  as  a
    work permit holder dependent on his  wife.   He  has  remained  in  the
    United Kingdom ever since.  The third-named appellant was born in India
    and was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as  a  permit  holder
    dependant in 2010.

5.   The applications for indefinite leave were refused by the  Claimant  on
    3rd July, 2012.  The basis for the refusal was because the  first-named
    appellant had been absent from the United Kingdom between 31st October,
    2009 until 17th  August,  2010.   That  is  an  absence  of  289  days.
    Paragraph 245AAA of Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC  395,
    as amended ("the immigration rules") provides that for the purposes  of
    calculating a continuous period of five years lawfully  in  the  United
    Kingdom, a period shall not  be  considered  to  be  broken  where  the
    applicant has been absent from the United Kingdom for a period  of  180
    days or less in any  of  the  five  consecutive  twelve  month  periods
    preceding the date of the application for leave to remain.

5.   The appellant appealed that decision to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In
    doing so she also raised a human rights appeal.  Her appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules was always bound  to  fail;  it  could  not  possibly
    succeed because her period of absence  was  289  days.   Unfortunately,
    before the Immigration Judge the appellant  chose  to  argue  that  the
    decision of the respondent was wrong in law rather than  to  deal  with
    the Article 8 claim.

6.   As  a  result  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mozolowski  heard  the
    appellant's  appeal  and  whilst  accepting  that  the  refusal   under
    paragraph 245HFC was simple in its terms, she concluded that there  was
    no mention in the Rules about any period of 180 days.  She accepted  at
    paragraph 18 of her determination that  a  continuous  period  of  five
    years means a continuous period, without any  period  of  interruption.
    She believed there to be some provision which might give her scope for,
    as she put it, "softening this  blow".   However  she  failed  to  have
    regard to paragraph 245AAA.  The judge allowed the  appellant's  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

7.   Not surprisingly the Claimant challenged  that  decision  pointing  out
    that it was wrong in law and failed to have regard to paragraph  245AAA
    and the definition there in sub-clause (a) of the continuous period  of
    five years lawfully in the United Kingdom.

8.   At the hearing before me today Mr Latif  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant accepted that there was  an  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    determination and accepted that his client  cannot  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  However  this  leaves  the  appellant's  Article  8
    appeal outstanding.

9.   I set aside First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mozolowski's  determination.   I
    determine the issue under the Immigration Rules myself and dismiss  the
    appellants' appeals.  The  appellant  cannot  succeed  under  paragraph
    245HF of the Immigration Rules because of her absence from  the  United
    Kingdom between October 2009 and August 2010 of 289 days.  However  the
    appellant's human rights appeal remains outstanding.

10.  Given the length of time the parties would have to wait for the  matter
    to be relisted before me in North Shields and that it could, conversely
    be heard relatively speedily by the First Tier Tribunal and in view  of
    the overriding objective informing the onward conduct of this appeal, I
    have decided that this appeal be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for hearing afresh before a First Tier Tribunal Judge, other than First
    Tier Tribunal Judge Mozolowski.
