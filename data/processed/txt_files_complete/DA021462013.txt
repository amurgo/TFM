Solicitors.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On the 14th May 2014 the Upper Tribunal found an error of law in the
        determination of the First-tier Tribunal although all findings other
        than those relating to  the  adequacy  of  the  changes  in  country
        conditions in Turkey are preserved. The scope  of  this  hearing  is
        limited to a consideration of whether the changes that have occurred
        in Turkey in relation to the treatment of Kurds and those  who  have
        come to the adverse attention of the authorities in the past is such
        that it can be said that there will not be a predictable  return  to
        the conditions of persecution for the Appellant if deported.


     2. The error of law finding document of the 4th July 2014 sets out  the
        basis on which the error of law was found  and  the  three  ways  in
        which an individual's status as a refugee can be removed which is by
        cancellation, cessation and revocation.  This is a cessation case.



Background


     3. The starting point must be the earlier determination of  Adjudicator
        CJ Lloyd promulgated on 17 July 2002.  Adjudicator Lloyd  heard  the
        Appellant's appeal against the direction for his  removal  from  the
        United Kingdom to Turkey following the  refusal  of  his  claim  for
        asylum. The Appellant was represented at that hearing  although  the
        Secretary of State failed to attend.


     4. The Appellant was  born  on  13  February  1965  and  is  a  Turkish
        national. He claimed to have fled Turkey following his detention and
        torture as a member of HADEP since 1994. He claimed to have attended
        political meetings and worked for  HADEP  which  he  stated  was  an
        illegal organisation. The Appellant claimed to have been arrested on
        many occasions between 1988 and 2000 and to have been  detained  for
        periods of several months. His claim was that he was  not  protected
        in Turkey and that the Turkish government was known to  keep  people
        in prison for years without evidence; although he also claims he was
        eventually released  in  each  case  as  a  result  of  their  being
        insufficient evidence to warrant his continued detention or to bring
        charges. The Appellant claimed to  have  suffered  injuries  to  his
        head, chest, and shoulder as a result of  torture  during  detention
        and claimed he could not relocate within Turkey as a result  of  his
        ethnicity as a Kurd.


     5. Adjudicator Lloyd summarises her findings regarding the  Appellant's
        credibility at paragraphs 24 to  26  of  the  determination  in  the
        following terms:


            24.   I have therefore, as stated  above,  several  reasons  to
                 query this Appellant's credibility. However, I have to  say
                 that I believe what he told me about his  support  for  the
                 Kurdish cause and about detentions in 1993 and 2000 when he
                 was seriously ill treated.


            25.   There is no medical report which  would  have  been  very
                 useful in this case but  I  have  seen  sizeable,  physical
                 scars on his body and head and I am prepared to accept that
                 they were caused as he states.


            26.   He may well have been arrested upon reasonable  suspicion
                 of involvement in illegal acts or events in both  1993  and
                 2000, but clearly there can be no justification for the ill
                 treatment of him. I accept his view  of  matters  which  is
                 that his Kurdish background was  a  reason  for  this  ill-
                 treatment.


     6. Adjudicator Lloyd concluded in paragraphs 31 and 32:


            31.   This Appellant is a Kurd  with  a  history  of  political
                 involvement and past detentions and I do not consider  that
                 ill-treatment can be ruled out. He bears visible body scars
                 which  I  accept  arose  from  previous  ill-treatment   by
                 representatives of the Turkish authorities.


            32.   I consider that there is a real risk that this  Appellant
                 would have a well founded fear  of  persecution  for  a  UN
                 Convention reason and a  real  risk  of  a  breach  of  his
                 absolute rights under Article  3  if  returned  to  Turkey,
                 notwithstanding the progress made by the government in  its
                 attempts to deal with violations of human rights.


     7. Adjudicator Lloyd allowed the appeal and there is within the  bundle
        a letter dated 15 August 2002 confirming a grant of  refugee  status
        upon the Appellant.


     8. The Appellant's wife and children also live in  the  United  Kingdom
        and were granted British citizenship in 2012. The Appellant  remains
        a Turkish citizen. He also found himself back before the  courts  in
        2009 when he was convicted, after trial, of the offence of rape  and
        false imprisonment. Although not relevant in other than setting  out
        the background, Mr Justice Treacy in his sentencing remarks stated:


            You were convicted after trial of  the  offences  of  rape  and
            false imprisonment.  Those offences were committed on the  same
            occasion in the small hours of 5th November of last year.


            Your victim was a young man, [LF]. He was 17 years  of  age  at
            the time. You are  in  your  mid-forties.   [LF]  was  a  young
            student out on his own in deserted streets making his way  home
            at 4.00am in  the  morning.  In  my  assessment  he  was  in  a
            vulnerable position.


            You subjected him to a frightening and disgusting  ordeal  once
            he had entered your car on the pretext that you were  going  to
            give him a lift.  You kept him prisoner in your car  until  you
            were able to carry out a sexual attack upon him.   You  ignored
            his pleas for release and you physically  forced  him  to  have
            oral sex.


            The immediate impact upon him was to cause him to suffer  fear,
            humiliation, and severe distress.  I have seen a victim  impact
            statement. It is clear that your actions have had a  continuing
            effect on him. I saw him give evidence at the trial.  I  formed
            the view that he was a truthful witness and I therefore  accept
            the content of his victim impact  statement.  He  suffers  from
            night terrors. He has had to consult  his  doctor  and  receive
            medication.  He suffers from a loss of social confidence and is
            generally uneasy in his life. It is you by your action that has
            stolen that peace of mind from him.


            You displayed at trial not the slightest remorse for  what  you
            have done.  You continue to show absolutely no remorse for what
            you did.  You demonstrated your attitude at trial by lying  and
            falsely accusing him of prowling the  street  for  sex  and  of
            having produced a knife in your car. The jury disbelieved  you.
            Your attitude to the offence, as I say, continues and  troubled
            greatly the probation officer who was assigned to consider your
            case.


     9. It was found the Appellant posed a risk to the public until  he  was
        able to understand and control  his  feelings  and  behaviour  as  a
        result of which the Sentencing Judge found he is a person who  poses
        a significant risk of serious harm to the public by  reason  of  the
        risk of serious sexual  offences  being  committed  by  him  in  the
        future. A sentence of imprisonment for public protection was  passed
        and the Court recommended that the Appellant is deported.


    10. The Appellant appealed his sentence which was quashed  and  replaced
        by a sentence of seven years imprisonment on each of the two  counts
        by the Court of Appeal (Criminal division) in  January  2010.  As  a
        result of his conviction he was made the subject of an order for his
        deportation pursuant to section 32(5) UK Borders Act  2007  on  11th
        October 2013. His appeal against that order came before  the  First-
        tier Tribunal which is the decision in relation  which  legal  error
        was found, although all other findings bar  those  relating  to  the
        adequacy of changes in Turkey are preserved. As  a  result,  if  the
        Appellant fails in this appeal he can be  removed  from  the  United
        Kingdom under the terms of the deportation order. If he succeeds and
        his status as a refugee cannot be taken from him he must succeed and
        be permitted to remain as a result of Exception  1  (Section  32(2))
        which arises where deportation would breach the Refugee Convention.


    11. The Respondent notified the UNHCR in advance of the  decision  being
        taken of her intention. In  their  letter  of  response  dated  16th
        November 2012 UNHCR refer to submissions and representations made by
        the Appellant's representatives,  Trott  &  Gentry  LLP  Solicitors,
        dated 4 September 2012 which are stated to be as follows:


            i.    The problem which existed  in  Turkey  which  led  to  Mr
                 Cakmak being granted asylum in the UK persists;


            ii.   The  persecution  of  persons  involved  with  HADEP  has
                 continued to be experienced  by  those  involved  with  the
                 successor parties to    HADEP;


            iii.  Mr Cakmak's claim was based not  solely  on  his  Kurdish
                 ethnicity but also  on  account  of  his  involvement  with
                 Kurdish political parties regarded as "separatist " by  the
                 Turkish authorities ;


            iv.    The  risk  of  harm  for  those  involved  with  Kurdish
                 political parties remains as great today as it was in  2002
                 when  Mr Cakmak was recognised as a refugee;


            v.     To  revoke  Mr  Cakmak's  refugee  status  would  breach
                 Articles 2 and  3  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
                 Rights.


    12. The UNHCR also state in the letter that their role in  such  matters
        is supervisory under Article 35 of the 1951  Convention,  commenting
        upon the appropriateness of applying the relevant legal source,  not
        making representations in support of continued  refugee  status.  In
        relation to the trigger of cessation clauses it is stated:


            UNHCR notes that the decision  to  cease  Mr  Cakmak's  refugee
            status is linked to his criminal conviction. However, the  fact
            that Mr Cakmak has been convicted  of  a  criminal  offence  is
            irrelevant and should not be taken into account when  making  a
            decision on the application of  Article  1C  (5)  of  the  1951
            Convention.   The  rationale  of  Article  1C  (5)  deals  with
            situations where circumstances leading to the grant of  refugee
            status have changed, and is not based on the individual conduct
            of the refugee concerned.


            UNHCR is seriously concerned about the invocation of  cessation
            clauses where the individual has committed an offence.   In  it
            UNHCR's view the approach whereby a refugee's criminal  conduct
            is used as a trigger for an individual consideration of Article
            1C (5) runs the risk of introducing  substantive  modifications
            of the cessation clauses by adding the provisions of Article 33
            (2) as a basis for consideration of the  cessation  of  refugee
            status. The rationale of Article 1C (5) deals  with  situations
            where circumstances leading to the grant of refugee status have
            changed, regardless of the individual conduct of the refugee.


    13. UNHCR highlight the fact the Respondent bears the burden of proof in
        establishing that Mr Cakmak is no longer entitled to refugee  status
        by virtue of the changing circumstances in his  country  of  origin.
        The Respondent must demonstrate that there have been fundamental and
        durable changes in the country of origin which  can  be  assumed  to
        remove the basis of fear of persecution.


    14. In relation to a specific reference in the Respondent's letter to  a
        Freedom House report of 18 December 2003 in which is it stated:


            While the government has made a great deal of progress  on  the
            legal aspects of these reforms, actual practices  have  changed
            far  more  slowly.  It  is  considered  that  although  Turkish
            citizens  of  Kurdish  ethnic  origin  may  face  some  unequal
            treatment  or  discrimination  from  the  authorities  and  the
            general population, it is not considered that  it  reaches  the
            level of persecution or breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.


        It is the expressed view of the UNHCR that this singular extract  is
        not  considered  sufficient  to  establish  that  there  have   been
        fundamental and durable changes of circumstances in Turkey such that
        they obviate the circumstances under which Mr Cakmak was  recognised
        as a refugee in a sustainable way. It is  stated  all  this  article
        demonstrates is that some progress has been made by  the  government
        but that this in itself does not obviate  the  possibility  that  Mr
        Cakmak continues to have a  well  founded  fear  of  persecution  if
        returned to Turkey. That was the position in the appeal on  17  June
        2002 and UNHCR consider this position continues to be valid.


    15. The UNHCR letter also refers  to  a  number  of  additional  reports
        published in 2012 before setting out their conclusion  that  on  the
        basis  of  the  material  provided  the  Respondent  had  failed  to
        substantiate their conclusion that Mr Cakmak's refugee status should
        be ceased. UNHCR are of the view this  case  is  one  in  which  the
        Respondent ought not to cease, and ask  that  their  representations
        are taken into account when considering the cessation decision.


    16. The  Secretary  of  State  did  consider  such  representations  but
        proceeded with  the  cessation  decision.   UNHCR  were  invited  to
        consider whether they wish to become a party to these proceedings by
        the Upper Tribunal but declined.



Discussion


    17. UNHCR are correct when they refer to the fact  that  the  burden  of
        proving the necessary changes have occurred falls upon the Secretary
        of State. There have been a considerable number of cases relating to
        Turkey and it is not disputed that there has been  some  improvement
        in relation to the situation for Kurdish citizens  as  a  result  of
        prospective EU membership. The Appellant's case is that such changes
        as have occurred are not sufficient.


    18. The opinion of the UNHCR, and weight to be given to its opinions,
        has also been the subject of consideration in the domestic courts.
        There are a number of authorities dealing with this issue including
        The Queen on the application of Mohn Golfa [2005] EWHC 2282 (Admin)
        in which Mr Justice Moses said that it was not irrational for the
        Secretary of State for the Home Department not to follow UNHCR's
        recommendation against removals to Liberia.  UNHCR should command
        respect and support but its policies were not co-extensive with
        those of individual states and it was lain from the terms of its
        reports that it did not confine consideration to persecution on the
        grounds specified in the Refugee Convention or whether removal would
        breach Article 3.  The Secretary of State should take UNHCR
        recommendations into account but was not bound by them. In HM and
        others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00409(IAC) the Tribunal
        decided, though very considerable weight is almost always to be
        attached to UNHCR guidelines on risk categories in particular
        countries, it is not accepted that departure from the guidelines
        should only take place for a cogent and identified reason. Cases are
        to be decided on the basis of all the evidence and arguments
        presented to the Tribunal. In HF (Iraq) and others v Secretary of
        State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1276 the Claimant
        failed asylum seekers unsuccessfully challenged the most recent
        country guidance decisions relating to Iraq. The Court rejected an
        argument that there was justification for conferring a presumptively
        binding status on UNHCR reports merely because of their source. The
        Court had to assess all the evidence affording such weight to
        different pieces of evidence as it saw fit. It was said that UNHCR
        was responsible not merely for objectively assessing risk but also
        for assisting returnees and the court was entitled to be alive to
        the possibility that the latter function might colour the risk
        assessment even if only subconsciously.


    19. Mr Mills opened his submissions by reference to the country guidance
        case of IK (Returnees-Records-IFA) Turkey CG [2004] UKIAT 00312. The
        following is a summary of the Tribunal's main  conclusions  in  this
        determination:


        i)    The GBTS comprises only outstanding arrest warrants,  previous
            arrests, restrictions on travel abroad, possible draft evasion,
            refusal to perform military service and tax arrears.  "Arrests"
            as comprised in the GBTS require some court  intervention,  and
            must be distinguished from "detentions" by the security  forces
            followed by release without charge. The GBTS is  fairly  widely
            accessible and is in particular available to the border  police
            at booths in Istanbul airport, and elsewhere in Turkey  to  the
            security forces.


        ii)   In addition, there is border control information  collated  by
            the national police (Department  for  Foreigners,  Borders  and
            Asylum) recording past legal arrivals and departures of Turkish
            citizens, and information about people prohibited from entering
            Turkey as a result of their activities abroad, collated by MIT.
            (Note a returnee who arrives with a one  way  emergency  travel
            document and about whom there is no record of a previous  legal
            departure is likely to be perceived as a failed  asylum  seeker
            and is likely to be taken to the police station at the  airport
            for further questioning rather than just waved through.)


        iii)  The Judicial Record  Directorate  keeps  judicial  records  on
            sentences served by convicted persons, separate from GBTS.  The
            system is known as "Adli  Sicil."  It  is  unlikely  that  this
            system would  be  directly  accessible  at  border  control  in
            addition to the information in the GBTS.


        iv)   The  Nufus  registration  system  comprises  details  of  age,
            residence, marriage, death, parents'  and  children's  details,
            and religious status. It may also include arrest  warrants  and
            if any of the people listed have been stripped of  nationality.
            There is no evidence that it is directly  available  at  border
            control.


        v)    If a person is held for  questioning  either  in  the  airport
            police station  after  arrival  or  subsequently  elsewhere  in
            Turkey and the situation justifies  it,  then  some  additional
            inquiry could be made of the  authorities  in  his  local  area
            about him, where more extensive  records  may  be  kept  either
            manually or on computer. Also, if the circumstances so justify,
            an enquiry could be made of the anti terror police  or  MIT  to
            see if an individual is of material interest to them.


        vi)   If there is a material entry in the  GBTS  or  in  the  border
            control information, or if a returnee is travelling on  a  one-
            way emergency travel  document,  then  there  is  a  reasonable
            likelihood that he will be  identifiable  as  a  failed  asylum
            seeker and could be sent to  the  airport  police  station  for
            further investigation.


        vii)  It will be for an Adjudicator in  each  case  to  assess  what
            questions are likely to be asked during such investigation  and
            how a returnee would respond without being required to lie. The
            ambit of the likely questioning  depends upon the circumstances
            of each case.


        viii) The escalation of the violence following the ending of the PKK
            ceasefire reinforced the Tribunal's that the risk to a  Kurdish
            returnee of ill treatment by the authorities may be greater  if
            his home area is in an area of conflict in Turkey than it would
            be elsewhere, for the reasons described in  paragraphs  90  and
            116 of the determination.


        ix)   The Turkish Government is taking  action  in  legislative  and
            structural terms to address  the  human  rights  problems  that
            present a serious obstacle to its membership of the EU. It  has
            made its zero tolerance policy towards torture  clear.  However
            the use of torture is long  and  deep-seated  in  the  security
            forces and it will  take  time  and  continued  and  determined
            effort to bring it under control in practice. It  is  premature
            to conclude that the long  established  view  of  the  Tribunal
            concerning the potential risk of torture in detention as per IA
            and others (Risk-Guidelines-Separatist) Turkey CG [2003]  UKIAT
            00034 (also known as ACDOG)  requires material revision on  the
            present evidence. However the situation will require review  as
            further evidence becomes available. For the time  being  as  in
            the past, each case must be assessed on its own merits from the
            individual's own history  and  the  relevant  risk  factors  as
            described in paragraph 46 of IA  and  others  (Risk-Guidelines-
            Separatist) Turkey CG [2003] UKIAT 00034 (also known as  ACDOG)
            .


        x)    Many of the individual risk factors described in IA and others
            (Risk-Guidelines-Separatist) Turkey CG [2003] UKIAT 00034 (also
            known as ACDOG) comprise in  themselves  a  broad  spectrum  of
            variable potential risk that requires careful evaluation on the
            specific facts of each appeal as a whole. The factors described
            in IA and others (Risk-Guidelines-Separatist) Turkey CG  [2003]
            UKIAT 00034 (also known  as  ACDOG)  were  not  intended  as  a
            simplistic checklist and should not be used as such.


        xi)   A young, fit, unmarried person,  leaving  his  home  area  and
            seeking unofficial employment in a big city, may not  feel  the
            need to register with  the  local  Mukhtar,  at  least  at  the
            outset.  Many  do  not.  However,  given  the  range  of  basic
            activities for which a certificate of residence is needed,  and
            which depend upon such  registration,  the  Tribunal  concluded
            that it would in most normal circumstances be unduly  harsh  to
            expect a person to live without  appropriate  registration  for
            any material time, as a requirement for  avoiding  persecution.
            This does not necessarily preclude the  viability  of  internal
            relocation for the reasons described in paragraph 133.13 of the
            determination.


        xii)  The proper course in assessing the  risk  for  a  returnee  is
            normally to decide first whether he has a well founded fear  of
            persecution in his  home  area  based  upon  a  case  sensitive
            assessment of the facts in the context of an  analysis  of  the
            risk factors  described  in  IA  and  others  (Risk-Guidelines-
            Separatist) Turkey CG [2003] UKIAT 00034 (also known as ACDOG).
            If he does not then he is unlikely  to  be  at  any  real  risk
            anywhere in Turkey.


        xiii) The risk to a specific individual in most  circumstances  will
            be at its highest in his home area for a  variety  of  reasons,
            and particularly if it is located in the areas of  conflict  in
            the south and  east  of  Turkey.  Conversely  the  differential
            nature of the risk outside that area may be sufficient to  mean
            that the individual would not be at real risk of persecution by
            the state or its agencies elsewhere in  Turkey,  even  if  they
            were made aware of the thrust of the information maintained  in
            his home area by telephone or  fax  enquiry  from  the  airport
            police station or elsewhere, or by a transfer of at least  some
            of the information to a new home area on registration with  the
            local Mukhtar there. Internal relocation may well therefore  be
            viable, notwithstanding the need for registration  in  the  new
            area. The issue is whether any  individual's  material  history
            would be reasonably likely to lead to persecution  outside  his
            home area.


        xiv)  This determination was intended  to  update  and  replace  the
            various earlier decisions in the light of further evidence  and
            argument, and now  comprises  the  Tribunal's  current  country
            guidance on the issues described.


    20. Risk in home area is the starting point. In R (on the application of
        Baydak) v SSHD [2008] EWHC 244 Judge Mackie QC said that IK made  it
        clear that an assessment of risk on return should begin by  deciding
        whether there  was  a  well  founded  fear  of  persecution  in  the
        claimant's home area based  on  an  analysis  of  the  risk  factors
        described in IA.  If the claimant was not at such risk, then it  was
        unlikely that he or she would be  at  any  real  risk  elsewhere  in
        Turkey, in terms of internal relocation.


    21. In SD (Turkey) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 1514 the Court of Appeal  said
        that the starting point in IK had  to  be  whether  there  would  be
        information about a returning asylum seeker in his home  area.   The
        issue was whether that record  was  reasonably  likely  to  lead  to
        persecution outside his home  area.  The  first  question  was  thus
        whether the information from the home area would arrive at the point
        at the point where the claimant would first  be  questioned  at  the
        airport. Precise findings had to be made on these issues. The  Court
        of Appeal then said that the absence of  a  record  under  the  GBTS
        system was not disparities as to the means which could  be  employed
        form enquiring about the background of a particular returning failed
        asylum seeker.  The Court said that it was incumbent on the Tribunal
        to reach conclusions on the nature of the questions which  could  be
        asked.  IK revealed there was  a  real  risk  persons  returning  on
        emergency documentation would be asked why they left  Turkey.   They
        were not expected to lie.  In this case there was,  in  the  Court's
        opinion, no reason to think that the  Appellant  would  not  explain
        when asked that he left Turkey because he had been  ill  treated  by
        the authorities and because of  the  authorities'  attitude  to  his
        brothers who were dissident Kurdish PKK  supporters.  The  Court  of
        Appeal said that then it required no  imagination  to  perceive  the
        likely consequences of such answers.


    22. In IA and others (Risk-Guidelines-Separatist) Turkey CG [2003] UKIAT
        00034  (also known as ACDOG) the Tribunal refined the factors  which
        "inexhaustively" they considered to be material in  giving  rise  to
        potential suspicion in the minds of  the  authorities  concerning  a
        particular claimant. In the latest case of IK the Tribunal said that
        these still have some relevance. They are referred to in more detail
        below.


    23. There have been considerable changes in Turkey since  the  Appellant
        left in 2001. The sizeable Kurdish minority, which by some estimates
        constitutes up to a fifth of the population,  remains  although  has
        long complained that the Turkish government was  trying  to  destroy
        their identity and that they suffer economic disadvantage and  human
        rights violations.  The Kurdistan  Workers  Party  (PKK),  the  best
        known  and  most  radical  of  the  Kurdish  movements,  launched  a
        guerrilla campaign in 1984 for a homeland in the  Kurdish  heartland
        in the southeast. Thousands died and hundreds  of  thousands  became
        refugees in the ensuing conflict with the PKK, which Turkey, the  US
        and the European Union deem a terrorist organisation.


    24. Kurdish guerrilla attacks briefly subsided after the 1999 capture of
        PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, but soon began to increase again. Partly
        in a bid to improve its chances of  EU  membership,  the  government
        began to ease restrictions on the use of the Kurdish  language  from
        2003 onwards. As part of a  new  "Kurdish  initiative"  launched  in
        2009, it pledged to extend linguistic and  cultural  rights  and  to
        reduce the military presence in the mainly Kurdish southeast of  the
        country.   Although  fighting  continued,  the  PKK  signalled   its
        readiness to join a cease fire  in  2010.  After  months  of  talks,
        Abdullah Ocalan ordered his fighters to stop  attacking  Turkey  and
        withdraw from the country from  May  2013,  effectively  ending  the
        insurgency.


    25. It was conceded by Mr Mills that it could not be  said  that  Turkey
        was a state in which all Kurds experienced no problems and that some
        from that country will still be entitled to refugee status depending
        upon their personal circumstances. I agree it  is  a  fact  specific
        assessment. I have been referred to a considerable volume of country
        material all of which I  have  considered  in  detail  even  if  not
        specifically referred to in the  body  of  this  determination.   In
        relation to Kurds in Turkey both  advocates  referred  to  the  most
        recent 2013 Respondents Operational Guidance Notes which in relation
        to Kurds states:


        3.10 Kurdish Ethnicity


        3.10.1    Some applicants may make an  asylum  and/or  human  rights
              claim based on ill-treatment amounting to persecution at  the
              hands  of  the  Turkish  authorities  due  to  their  Kurdish
              ethnicity.


        3.10.2    Treatment. Restrictions remained on use of languages other
              than Turkish in political and  public  life.  Children  whose
              first language was Kurdish  could  not  be  taught  fully  in
              Kurdish in either private or public  schools.  However,  with
              the introduction  of  the  new  -4+4+4  education  system  in
              September 2012, Kurdish was taught as an elective  course  in
              the fifth grade, to be expanded into the  next  higher  grade
              each year after that. At  least  three  universities  offered
              Kurdish language programs. The Kurdish inmates who  conducted
              a hunger  strike  from  12  September  to  18  November  2012
              demanded, among other things, the right to use  their  mother
              tongue in schooling, courtroom defence and  local  government
              administration.


        3.10.3     Fighting  between  security  forces  and  the   terrorist
              organisation PKK, which began in 1984  and  continued  during
              2011, resulted in hundreds of thousands of citizens, the vast
              majority of whom were Kurds, living as  Internally  Displaced
              Persons in the country. The Internal Displacement  Monitoring
              Centre reported as many as  1.2  million,  while  some  human
              rights groups put the number significantly higher.


        3.10.4    The government's -democratic opening, announced in  summer
              2009 to address the minority rights of Kurds in  Turkey,  did
              not progress. Ground-breaking negotiations between the  state
              and the armed, outlawed PKK to reach a settlement to end  the
              ongoing conflict collapsed. In July 2011  violence  escalated
              with the PKK stepping up attacks on the military and  police,
              and the Turkish government in August 2011 launching the first
              aerial bombardment of PKK bases since 2008.  Among  a  rising
              number of attacks on civilians were two on 2 September  2011:
              an Ankara bombing by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) -  a
              PKK-linked group - which killed three and a PKK attack  on  a
              car that killed four women in Siirt.  The  non-resolution  of
              the Kurdish issue remains the  single  greatest  obstacle  to
              progress on human rights in Turkey.


        3.10.5    Following the general election of 12 June 2012 and the re-
              election  of  Prime  Minister  Recep  Tayyip  Erdogan's   AKP
              government pledged to embark on a complete  revision  of  the
              1982 Constitution through consensus and negotiation with  the
              opposition, parties outside of Parliament, the  media,  NGOs,
              with academics and with anyone  who  had  something  to  say.
              Changes  to  the  Constitution  were  crucial  for   Turkey's
              minorities, since only three minority groups  were  currently
              recognised, namely Armenians, Greeks and  Jews.  The  others,
              including Alevis,  Kurds  and  Roma,  remain  excluded.  Even
              recognised minorities continue to face discrimination and the
              Parliament Conciliation Commission had been set up to work on
              revising the Constitution. Representatives of minority groups
              had begun to push for their cultural,  linguistic  and  civil
              and  political  rights  to  be  incorporated   in   the   new
              Constitution and to be recognised as equal citizens.


        3.10.6    On a more positive  note,  on  12  June  2012  Al  Jazeera
              reported that Turkey had announced plans to allow schools  to
              teach the  Kurdish  language  as  an  elective  subject.  The
              article stated that this was a  step  towards  reconciliation
              but some Kurdish minority activists argued this  did  not  go
              far enough. The report stated that Recep Tayyip Erdogan  told
              his  ruling  party  members  in  Parliament  that  if  enough
              students came together, Kurdish could be taken as an elective
              lesson. Erdogan told Parliament the measure was  'a  historic
              step'. The government was trying to stop decades of  fighting
              with Kurdish fighters seeking autonomy in the largely Kurdish
              southeast. The teaching of Kurdish had long  been  banned  in
              schools on the grounds that it could divide the country along
              ethnic lines.


        3.10.7    According to a BBC News Report of 23 November 2011,  Recep
              Tayyip Erdogan, has apologised for the killing of  more  than
              13,000 Kurds by the Turkish military in the  late  1930s.  He
              was the first Turkish leader to  make  the  apology  for  the
              killings that  occurred  when  the  army  crushed  a  Kurdish
              rebellion in Dersim, using aerial bombings  and  poison  gas.
              The unexpected apology came at  a  time  of  tension  between
              Turkey and its minority Kurdish population. The killings took
              place between 1936 and 1939 when the  Kurdish  population  of
              the south-eastern region of Dersim - now known as  Tunceli  -
              resisted the efforts of the newly formed Turkish republic  to
              exert its authority there. The CHP was in office at the  time
              of the Dersim operation and has been shaken  by  an  internal
              debate sparked by one of its own deputies, who was  from  the
              area  and  called   on   the   party   to   acknowledge   its
              responsibility  for  the  killings.  Mr   Erdogan's   apology
              appeared to be part of a war of words with the leader of  the
              CHP, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, whose family had strong  links  with
              Tunceli. Mr Erdogan's government has made some attempt to win
              over Turkey's large Kurdish minority, which lives  mainly  in
              the south-east  of  Turkey,  by  improving  their  legal  and
              cultural rights and has also taken a tough stance towards the
              Kurdish insurgency  and  its  supporters,  with  hundreds  of
              Kurdish activists arrested in recent months.


        3.10.8    According to an article in the New York Times,  For  Kurds
              in Turkey, Autonomy in Music, 1 June 2011, concessions by the
              government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2009 made way  for  the
              first Kurdish national television  station.  Token  gestures,
              they made  front-page  headlines:  first  because  they  were
              signals to the outside world that a democratic state  run  by
              an Islamic leader will not automatically become xenophobic or
              tribalist,  and  second  because  even  small  steps   toward
              acknowledging   Kurdish   culture   can   provoke   political
              firestorms inside the country. Turkish nationalists were very
              displeased as even the most basic Kurdish demand was seen  as
              treason.


        3.10.9     Inconsistent  Court  decisions  regarding  the   use   of
              languages other than Turkish were  prevalent  throughout  the
              country. The country had active privately owned print  media.
              Hundreds  of  private  newspapers  spanning   the   political
              spectrum appeared in numerous languages,  including  Kurdish,
              Armenian, Arabic, English  and  Farsi.  However,  authorities
              routinely censored media with pro-Kurdish or leftist content,
              particularly in the Southeast, by confiscating  materials  or
              temporarily closing down the media source.  The  government's
              close business relationships with various media conglomerates
              further limited media independence and encouraged  a  climate
              of self-censorship.


        3.10.10   Conclusion Although Turkish  citizens  of  Kurdish  ethnic
              origin may face some unequal treatment or discrimination both
              from the authorities and the general population this does not
              generally reach the level of persecution or breach Article  3
              of the ECHR. Therefore it is unlikely that applicants in this
              category whose claims are based solely on persecution due  to
              their Kurdish ethnicity would qualify for a grant  of  asylum
              or Humanitarian Protection and such claims are likely  to  be
              clearly unfounded.


    26. Section 3.9 of the OGN considering involvement  with  Kurdish,  Left
        Wing or Islamic Terrorist Groups or Political Parties, states:


        3.9.1     Applicants may make an asylum and/or  human  rights  claim
              based on ill treatment amounting to persecution at the  hands
              of the Turkish authorities due to  their  involvement  (or  a
              family members involvement) at either a  high  or  low  level
              with illegal Kurdish, left wing or Islamic terrorists  groups
              or Kurdish, left wing or Islamic political parties.


        3.9.2     Treatment. Citizens of Kurdish origin constituted a  large
              ethnic and linguistic group. More  than  15  million  of  the
              country's citizens identified themselves as of Kurdish origin
              and spoke Kurdish dialects. Kurds who publicly or politically
              asserted their Kurdish identity or promoted using Kurdish  in
              the public domain risked censure, harassment or  prosecution,
              although significantly less so than in previous years.


        3.9.3     As Turkey's biggest Kurdish-majority  city  and  province,
              Diyarbak?r is critical to any examination  of  the  country's
              Kurdish problem and of the insurgent PKK.  According  to  the
              International Crisis Group in their report, Turkey's  Kurdish
              Impasse: The View From Diyarbakir of 30  November  2012,  the
              armed conflict has deteriorated in the past year and  a  half
              to its worst level in over a decade, with increased political
              friction and violence leading to the deaths of at  least  870
              people since June 2011.


        3.9.4     The International Crisis  Group  states  that  across  the
              political spectrum in Diyarbakir, there is  a  shared  desire
              for a government strategy to resolve the  chronic  issues  of
              Turkey's Kurdish problem which includes official  recognition
              of Kurdish identity, the right to education, fairer political
              representation, decentralisation and an end to all  forms  of
              discrimination in the laws and constitution. They also demand
              legal reform  to  end  mass  arrests  and  lengthy  pre-trial
              detentions of non-violent  activists  on  terrorism  charges.
              Control of Diyarbak?r is contested on many levels. The  state
              wants to stay in charge, directing its influence through  the
              Ankara-appointed Governor and control over-budget,  policing,
              education,  health  and   infrastructure   development.   The
              municipality, in the hands of  legal  pro-PKK  parties  since
              1999, most recently the Peace and Democracy Party  (BDP),  is
              gathering more  power  against  considerable  obstacles.  The
              Justice and Development Party (AKP) that rules nationally has
              ushered in a more progressive approach to  police,  but  this
              has not stopped confrontations and defused  local  hostility.
              According to the International  Crisis  Group,  Turkey  as  a
              whole,  and  Kurdish  speaking  cities  like  Diyarbak?r   in
              particular,  require   a   coherent,   informed   debate   on
              decentralisation and a strategy to implement it.


        3.9.5     During 2012 police routinely detained demonstrators for  a
              few hours at a time, and human rights  organisations  claimed
              this practice sharply increased from previous years. In  2010
              the  government  began  trying  cases  against  thousands  of
              persons alleged to be members or supporters of the  Kurdistan
              Communities Union (KCK), a part of the political organisation
              of  the  PKK  terrorist  group.  The  BDP  and  human  rights
              organisations  claimed  that,  over  a   three-year   period,
              authorities detained approximately 20,000  persons,  of  whom
              they arrested 8,000 and approximately 4,000 remained detained
              awaiting trial, including  32  elected  mayors,  hundreds  of
              political party officials and numerous journalists and  human
              rights activists. Arrests and hearings  continued  throughout
              2012, with judges normally rejecting defendants' requests for
              conditional release, permission to dispute  the  validity  of
              the charges and permission for the defendants  to  use  their
              mother tongue. Arrests and indictments continued at  the  end
              of 2012.


        3.9.6     Following the PKK  ceasefire  declaration  and  subsequent
              decrease of clashes between the PKK and the  security  forces
              in 2010, violence escalated again significantly in 2011  with
              fatalities on both sides. There were also significant Kurdish
              civilian fatalities as a result of the attacks  and  upheaval
              within these communities continued, particularly in the south-
              east of the country and near the Iraq border. During  an  air
              raid in December 2011 near the Turkey-Iraq border, 35 Kurdish
              civilians were killed. The government stated that the attacks
              were targeting  armed  PKK  forces  and  passed  on  official
              condolences to the bereaved families.


        3.9.7     In addition, Kurdish officials and activists, most of them
              allegedly associated with the KCK and the PKK,  continued  to
              be arrested. In August 2011, 98 former Mayors and eight other
              politicians were arrested because they had stipulated  better
              conditions for Abdullah �calan, the imprisoned ex-PKK leader.
              An estimated 9,000 individuals have been arrested since  2009
              for alleged links to the  KCK.  In  Spring  2011,  trials  of
              another 153 Kurds in custody resumed. The defendants  in  the
              Diyarbakir Heavy Penal Court asked to conduct  their  defence
              in Kurdish, but this was denied by the Court.


        3.9.8     The law provides for freedom  of  assembly.  However,  the
              government  selectively  restricted  meetings  to  designated
              sites   or   dates   and   banned   demonstrations   outright
              particularly if they were concerned with sensitive issues  or
              were critical of the government. There were confirmed  and/or
              credible  reports  that  police  beat,  abused,  or  harassed
              demonstrators during 2012. A report by  the  main  opposition
              Republican People's Party (CHP), sourced to the Human  Rights
              Foundation (HRF), the Human Rights Association (HRA) and  the
              Migration Foundation, stated that four  persons  were  killed
              and 555 wounded during demonstrations through November  2012.
              According to the CHP report, police detained  46,529  persons
              and  arrested  1,831  involved  in   demonstrations   through
              November 2012 a significant increase from 2011. The  Jandarma
              reported that it detained 72 persons and later released  them
              in 10 different demonstrations during  2012.  The  detentions
              varied in length from several hours to several days.


        3.9.9     Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir continued to face multiple
              administrative,   civil,    and    criminal    charges    and
              investigations for use of  the  Kurdish  language,  spreading
              terrorist propaganda and  promoting  terrorism.  During  2011
              prosecutors opened 13 new  investigations  or  cases  against
              Baydemir. Most of the cases involved Baydemir's expression of
              his political views or speaking  Kurdish  at  public  events.
              During 2011 he received at  least  two  acquittals  and  four
              convictions but he remained in his position  as  Mayor.  Many
              cases  and  appeals  were  pending  at  the  end   of   2011.
              Inconsistent Court decisions regarding the use  of  languages
              other than Turkish  was  prevalent  throughout  the  country.
              However, the wide availability of satellite dishes and  cable
              television allowed access to  foreign  broadcasts,  including
              several Kurdish-language private  channels.  In  addition  to
              Turkish, the High Board of Radio and Television allowed radio
              and television stations to  broadcast  in  Arabic,  Armenian,
              Assyrian, Bosnian, Circassian, Laz and Kurdish during 2011.


        3.9.10    The Courts continued to use terrorism  laws  to  prosecute
              hundreds of demonstrators deemed to be PKK supporters  as  if
              they were the group's armed militants. Most  spent  prolonged
              periods in pre-trial detention and those  convicted  received
              long prison sentences.


        3.9.11    The law does not provide a separate category for political
              prisoners. The HRA asserted that there were several  thousand
              political  prisoners  from  across  the  political  spectrum,
              including  journalists,   political   party   officials   and
              academics. The government stated that  those  alleged  to  be
              political prisoners were in fact charged with  being  members
              of, or assisting, terrorist  organisations.  Consistent  with
              the broad definition of terrorism  and  threats  to  national
              security,  prosecutors  often  did  not  distinguish  between
              persons who incited violence, those who supported the use  of
              violence by the  PKK  or  those  who  rejected  violence  but
              sympathized with some or all of the political  goals  of  the
              Kurdish nationalist movement. According to  the  Ministry  of
              Justice, as of 31 December 2012,  there  were  4,446  persons
              detained and 3,699 convicted on terrorism charges.


        3.9.12    The U.N Committee Against  Torture,  in  their  report  of
              November 2010, stated they had grave concerns about numerous,
              ongoing and consistent  allegations  concerning  the  use  of
              torture, particularly  in  unofficial  places  of  detention.
              These  allegations   come   despite   the   State   providing
              information that combating torture and ill-treatment has been
              a 'priority item' and despite the fact that there had been  a
              decrease in the number of reports on torture and other  forms
              of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment  and  punishment  in
              official  places  of  detention.  The  Committee   was   also
              concerned by the absence of prompt, thorough, independent and
              effective  investigations   into   allegations   of   torture
              committed by security and law enforcement officers. Many  law
              enforcement officers found guilty  of  ill-treatment  receive
              only suspended sentences, which had contributed to a  climate
              of impunity. Prosecutions into allegations  of  torture  were
              often conducted under Article 256 (excessive use of force) or
              Article 86 (intentional injury)  of  the  Penal  Code,  which
              proscribe lighter sentences.25 Following  its  November  2010
              review  of  Turkey,  the  United  Nations  Committee  against
              Torture raised concerns  about  the  failure  to  investigate
              numerous, ongoing and consistent allegations  concerning  the
              use of torture and asked Turkey to report  again  in  a  year
              regarding steps taken to address the problems identified.  In
              September 2011 Turkey ratified the Optional Protocol  to  the
              UN Convention against Torture.


        3.9.13    Conclusion Although relatives of members or supporters  of
              Kurdish, left wing or Islamic terrorist groups  or  political
              parties may face some  police  harassment  or  discrimination
              there is no evidence to suggest that this, in  general,  will
              reach the level of persecution. However, each  case  must  be
              considered on its individual facts.


        3.9.14    The Turkish government has made changes to its legislation
              and has committed to a policy of combating  torture  and  ill
              treatment. However, whilst there has been a decrease  in  the
              number of reported instances of torture and  other  forms  of
              cruel,  inhuman   or   degrading   treatment   instances   of
              mistreatment still occur. Those who are accepted as being  in
              leading  roles,  or  otherwise  significantly  involved  with
              Kurdish, left wing or Islamic terrorist groups  or  political
              parties are likely to face prosecution for activities against
              the  state  and  may  also  experience  mistreatment  by  the
              security forces amounting  to  persecution  or  a  breach  of
              Article 3 of the ECHR. If it is accepted  that  the  claimant
              is, or is suspected of being a high  profile  member/activist
              of a separatist group and has or is being prosecuted  by  the
              authorities for separatist activity then there may be a  real
              risk or persecution or ill treatment contrary  to  Article  3
              and a grant of asylum  or  Humanitarian  Protection  in  such
              cases may be appropriate.


        3.9.15    Case owners should note that members  of  these  terrorist
              groups have  been  responsible  for  numerous  serious  human
              rights abuses. If it is  accepted  that  a  claimant  was  an
              active operational member of combatant for any Kurdish, Left-
              wing or  Islamic  terrorist  organisation  and  the  evidence
              suggests he/she has been involved in such actions, then  case
              owners should consider whether one of the  Exclusion  clauses
              is applicable. Case owners  should  refer  such  cases  to  a
              Senior Caseworker in the first instance.


    27. Paragraph 3.9.14 is said by Mr Mills to represent the  Secretary  of
        State's position and to support the argument that there has been the
        necessary level of change in Turkey. It  is  submitted  that  rather
        than there being a general risk to members of Kurdish  ethnic  group
        it is only those seen  as  being  in  leading  roles,  or  otherwise
        significantly involved with Kurdish, left wing or Islamic  terrorist
        groups or political parties that are likely to face prosecution  for
        activities  against  the  state  and   who   may   also   experience
        mistreatment by the security forces amounting to  persecution  or  a
        breach of Article 3 ECHR. It was submitted that  the  Appellant  was
        not in this category in 2002 as all it was found  was  that  he  was
        employed by local government, from which he was not  dismissed,  and
        that he had an association and no more that caused him to be at risk
        in 2002. That the substantial changes that have occurred  are  being
        maintained in relation to such low-level  individuals  supports  the
        cessation decision.


    28. In 2002 it is plausible that anybody thought or perceived  to  be  a
        supporter of HADEP would have been targeted by  the  authorities  as
        this  was  considered  to  be  an  organisation  supporting  Kurdish
        separatism which was eventually declared illegal by the  authorities
        in 2003.


    29. The progress being made was recognised by the Tribunal  hearing  the
        country guidance case of IK who reflect on the recent  human  rights
        developments in Turkey at that  time,  in  2003.  They  specifically
        comment upon HADEP/DEHAP from paragraph 18 of the  determination  in
        the following terms:


            17.   HADEP/DEHAP
            18.   HADEP (The Peoples' Democracy Party) was founded in 1994.
                 It was a successor to the successively banned AGP, DEP  and
                 OZDEP. It is described in the Dutch  report,  to  which  we
                 have referred above, as having around 60,000 members and as
                 drawing support mainly from among  Kurds.  HADEP  campaigns
                 for greater  cultural  rights  for  Kurds  and  a  peaceful
                 solution to the Kurdish issue and is  described  as  having
                 kept to that position by never resorting to violence. It is
                 said to be viewed by the Turkish authorities as  the  PKK's
                 political wing and as  a  consequence  they  view  it  with
                 suspicion. It is said that HADEP has no  direct  ties  with
                 the PKK but relies largely on the same supporters.
            19.    As  we  have  noted  above,  HADEP  was  banned  by  the
                 Constitutional Court in March 2003 on the grounds  that  it
                 aided and abetted the PKK. DEHAP (The  Democratic  Peoples'
                 Party) which was founded in 1997 claims not to be solely  a
                 Kurdish party but to be a party of Turkey. It  is  said  in
                 Annex B   to the CIPU report that in early  September  2002
                 HADEP, DEP and SDP (Socialist Democracy Party)  decided  to
                 unite under the roof of DEHAP at the  general  election  in
                 November 2002. DEHAP has not been banned, but, as is  noted
                 above, the Public Prosecutor has  filed  a  case  to  close
                 DEHAP also, accusing it of becoming a faction  contravening
                 the principles of equality and an illegal state within  the
                 Democratic Republic. We note  that  in  the  November  2002
                 general election DEHAP claimed 6.2% of the vote but  failed
                 to win a seat in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
            20.   On page 25 of the US State Department report 2003 we find
                 the following:
                 "HADEP/DEHAP leaders said state harassment of the party has
                 continued to decline gradually through the past few  years,
                 following a steep reduction in PKK related  conflict.  They
                 said the party was able  to  operate  more  freely  in  the
                 November  Parliamentary  elections  than  in  the  previous
                 election in 1999.  However,  throughout  the  year,  police
                 raided dozens of HADEP offices, particularly in  the  south
                 east, and had detained  hundreds  of  HADEP  officials  and
                 members. DEHAP and HADEP members were regularly harassed by
                 Jandarma and security officials, including verbal  threats,
                 arbitrary arrests at rallies and detention at  checkpoints.
                 The security forces also  readily  harassed  villages  they
                 believed were sympathetic to  HADEP/DEHAP.  Most  detainees
                 were released within a short  period,  many  faced  trials,
                 usually for "supporting an illegal organisation", "inciting
                 separatism", or for violations of the law on  meetings  and
                 demonstrations."
            21.   In G's bundle at page  706  and  thereafter  there  is  a
                 report of the Turkish Human  Rights  Association  of  March
                 2003. The major activities of the Human Rights  Association
                 are described at paragraph 6.208 of the CIPU report.  These
                 are to collect  and  verify  information  on  human  rights
                 violations and  it  publishes  monthly  reports  and  press
                 releases on arrests, torture,  disappearances  in  custody,
                 violation of the right to freedom  of  expression.  It  has
                 financial support  from  EU  member  states  in  organising
                 courses for teachers and lawyers  which  also  cover  local
                 procedures for the right of individual petition. There is a
                 strong Kurdish current within  the  HRA.  It  is  regularly
                 harassed and obstructed by the authorities, and  in  recent
                 years some of its regional offices  have  temporarily  been
                 shut down and criminal proceedings brought against  various
                 HRA  workers  for  separatist  propaganda  or  support  for
                 illegal organisations.
    30. The UNHCR, together with Miss Rutherford on behalf of the Appellant,
        refer to the fact that the refusal letter appears  to  suggest  that
        the Appellant was granted refugee status as a result of his  Kurdish
        ethnicity which is stated not to be factually correct, as it was  on
        the basis of his association with HADEP and his  repeated  detention
        and ill treatment at the hands of the  authorities  whilst  detained
        which is the real reason.  It is submitted on the Appellant's behalf
        that the  Respondent's  position  is  contrary  to  the  information
        contained in the OGN dated May 2013 (see above) in which  is  it  is
        accepted that those who have leading  roles  or  who  are  otherwise
        significantly involved with Kurdish, left  wing,  Islamic  terrorist
        groups or political parties will face a real risk.   It  is  further
        submitted that the available material does not demonstrate a durable
        change.


    31. In relation to more recent developments: in June 2014,  the  Turkish
        parliament adopted a law to 'bring a stronger  legal  foundation  to
        the settlement process'  aiming  at  providing  a  solution  of  the
        Kurdish issue.  The  law  was  adopted  with  broad  support  across
        political parties. It encompasses measures to  eliminate  terrorism,
        strengthen  social  inclusion,  re-integrate  those  who  leave  the
        Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and lay down their arms, and  prepare
        public  opinion  for  the  return  of  former  fighters.   The   law
        strengthens the basis for the settlement process and is said to make
        a positive contribution to stability and protection of human  rights
        in Turkey.


    32. The European  Union  Enlargement  Report  dated  October  2014  also
        reflects a number of developments to  date.  Accession  negotiations
        started in 2005 and there are a  number  of  such  progress  reports
        available  in   the   public   domain   on   the   EU   website   at
        http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/detailed-country-
        information/turkey/index_en.htm.  These   record   developments   in
        relation to he Kurdish issues, especially from September 2013.


    33. A number of shortcoming are identified in Turkey which  the  authors
        of the report state "need to be addressed and the  authorities  need
        to enhance efforts to protect other fundamental rights and  freedoms
        so that all citizens can exercise their rights  without  hindrance".
        It is stated  that  "the  signature  of  the  EU-Turkey  readmission
        agreement on 16 December 2013 in parallel with the start of the visa
        liberalisation  dialogue  created  a  new  momentum  for   EU-Turkey
        relations. The readmission agreement entered into force on 1 October
        2014, while the first report on Turkey's progress in  the  framework
        of the visa liberalisation roadmap will be published on  20  October
        2014. It is important that these two processes  move  forward.  Full
        and  effective  implementation  vis-�-vis  all  Member   States   is
        crucial".


    34.  Interim  progress  is  recognised  by  the  statements  that:  "The
        government continued  its  work  to  ensure  compliance  with  legal
        safeguards for the prevention  of  torture  and  ill-treatment.  The
        downward trend in the incidence and  severity  of  ill-treatment  in
        official detention places continued. However, the  frequent  use  of
        excessive force during demonstrations and arrests remains  a  matter
        of concern. Turkey needs to adopt clear and  binding  rules  on  the
        proportionate use of force  in  demonstrations,  in  line  with  the
        relevant Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention  of  Torture
        (CPT) recommendations and ECtHR case-law. Parliament's Human  Rights
        Inquiry Committee started monitoring ill-treatment  during  military
        service. Instances of ill-treatment of conscripts  continued  to  be
        reported. Law enforcement bodies continued to  launch  counter-cases
        against those alleging torture or ill-treatment. In many  instances,
        these counter-cases were given priority by the courts.  The  absence
        of prompt, thorough, independent and effective  investigations  into
        all allegations of torture by law  enforcement  officers  remains  a
        concern."


    35. In relation to the situation in the east and south-east  the  report
        states:


        The  settlement  process  aiming  at  solving  the   Kurdish   issue
        continued. Options for a solution were widely and freely  discussed.
        Measures adopted in  March  allowed  for  campaigning  by  political
        parties and candidates in languages other than Turkish during  local
        and parliamentary elections, extended  state  funding  to  political
        parties that receive more than 3 % of the vote, allowed for  private
        education in children's  mother  tongue,  and  lifted  the  criminal
        punishment for the use of non-Turkish letters, addressing  primarily
        problems stemming from the use of Kurdish letters X, Q and W.


        On 11 June, parliament adopted a law on  eliminating  terrorism  and
        strengthening social integration. Its aim is to provide  a  stronger
        legal basis  for  the  settlement  process.  The  law  grants  legal
        protection to those involved in talks with the PKK, which is on  the
        EU   list   of   terrorist   organisations   and   facilitates   the
        rehabilitation of PKK militants who give up  arms.  Abdullah  �calan
        and the pro-Kurdish BDP and HDP parties welcomed the law (see  above
        2.1 - Democracy and the rule of law).


        A positive atmosphere prevailed in general,  including  for  Newroz.
        There was continued state engagement with the imprisoned PKK  leader
        Abdullah �calan. The April revision  of  the  law  on  the  National
        Intelligence Service  provided  legal  guarantees  for  intelligence
        officials conducting talks with �calan.


        Sporadic violent incidents occurred, leading to some casualties,  in
        particular in regions where  military  security  installations  were
        constructed or  strengthened.  The  PKK  kidnapped  several  persons
        throughout the year, including  civil  servants  and  soldiers.  All
        kidnapped persons were released after intervention from Kurdish MPs.
        The PKK  withdrawal  from  Turkey  slowed  and  in  January  it  was
        announced  that  it  had  stopped.  �calan's  Newroz   message   did
        nevertheless express hope for the process. The  government-initiated
        committee  of  wise  persons  finalised  its   reports,   containing
        recommendations  for  the  settlement  process.   These   were   not
        published.


        After the abolition of Article 10 of the  Anti-Terror  Law  and  the
        reduction of the maximum pre-trial detention period to  five  years,
        most defendants accused in cases  relating  to  the  Kurdish  issue,
        including the KCK case, were released. Some remained  in  prison  if
        they had been convicted on other charges,  including  under  Article
        314 of the Turkish Criminal Code on armed organisations.


        The  clearance  of  anti-personnel   landmines   continued.   Turkey
        requested that the 2014 deadline to dispose  of  all  anti-personnel
        landmines, whose  number  is  estimated  at  around  a  million,  be
        extended until 2022. The clearance of mines along  the  border  with
        Syria stopped in the second half of 2013. Turkey became a  party  to
        the  'Convention  on  the  Prohibition  of  the  Use,   Stockpiling,
        Production  and  Transfer  of  Anti-Personnel  Mines  and  on  their
        Destruction' (Ottawa Convention) in 2003; however  it  was  able  to
        obtain an extension of the deadline until 2022 in  order  to  fulfil
        its obligation.


        The  South-East  Anatolia  Project  to  improve  the   socioeconomic
        development of the region continued, with  notable  improvements  in
        infrastructure. Dam  projects  were  criticised  for  destroying  or
        threatening historical heritage, natural habitats  and  agricultural
        land.


        No  steps  were  taken  to  abolish  the  village  guard  system,  a
        paramilitary force of 46 739 people, paid and armed by the state.


        In November 2013 the ECtHR decided (Benzer  and  Others  v.  Turkey)
        that Turkey had violated Article 2 (on  right  to  life,  inadequate
        investigation) and Article 3 (prohibition of  inhuman  or  degrading
        treatment) of the European Convention on  Human  Rights  in  a  1994
        incident that included the bombing of civilians by the  military  in
        two villages in ??rnak. 18 In January, the  General  Staff  Military
        Prosecutor's Office announced a decision not  to  prosecute  in  the
        case of the  2011  killing  of  34  civilians  by  the  military  at
        Uludere/Roboski, on the grounds that the officers  involved  in  the
        air operation were not at fault. The victims' families have launched
        an individual application with the Constitutional Court.


        The  statute  of  limitations  for  cases  of  missing  persons  and
        extrajudicial killings dating from  the  1990s  remained  in  force.
        Several cases were dropped as a  result.  Twelve  court  cases  were
        ongoing regarding past crimes, all  of  which  were  transferred  to
        western provinces for security reasons. There is an urgent need  for
        effective investigation  into  these  killings,  involving  forensic
        scientists, lawyers, victims' families, human rights  organisations,
        academics, and international cooperation mechanisms.


        Overall, the settlement process continued, despite sporadic tensions
        in the southeast. The law on eliminating terrorism and strengthening
        social integration provides a    stronger legal foundation  for  the
        settlement talks. Legislative changes are needed  to  eliminate  the
        lack of accountability and the statute of limitations  in  cases  of
        killings from the 1990s, as well  as  those  perpetrated  in  recent
        years.


    36. There is clearly a greater degree of progress than that referred  to
        in earlier country evidence and reflected in other material to which
        the tribunal has been referred, including the  US  State  Department
        reports.


    37. It is not suggested that the Appellant has been active  in  relation
        to Kurdish issues in the United Kingdom and so there is no sur place
        element to his case. Family members have returned to Turkey  and  it
        is noted they were able to pass through the airport and  remain  and
        leave the country without experiencing any difficulties  or  adverse
        attention.


    38. It was found by Adjudicator Lloyd that "I accept his view of matters
        which is that his Kurdish background was  a  reason  for  this  ill-
        treatment".   The   involvement    of    the    Appellant    as    a
        supporter/sympathiser of HADEP was enough to create a real  risk  on
        return which is a finding supported by the country material in  2002
        when the decision was made. This  was  before  the  commencement  of
        negotiations with the EU in 2005.


    39.  The Appellant was  a  sympathiser/supporter  at  a  time  when  the
        Turkish State took a very hard line against  supporters  of  Kurdish
        separatist groups. Adjudicator Lloyd found that the catalyst for his
        ill-treatment was his Kurdish ethnicity. His support for HADEP would
        have created an adverse perception in the minds of  the  authorities
        if they were aware he supported that group, as he claims he did, and
        was ill-treated in detention as a result. The country material  from
        all sources reflects ongoing concern  about  the  use  of  arbitrary
        arrest, detention and ill treatment in  detention  and  the  use  of
        excess force to break up demonstrations in Turkey. In relation to  a
        person of Kurdish ethnicity  the  country  evidence  demonstrates  a
        material change in the approach taken by the authorities  in  Turkey
        in that being a Kurd does not create a real risk  of  ill  treatment
        sufficient to amount to persecution or a breach of  Article  3,  per
        se.


    40. In relation to supporters/members of Kurdish parties, the  Appellant
        is not a leader or person with a profile  (actual  of  imputed  when
        viewed through the eyes of any potential persecutor)  of  influence.
        He is not and has never been a member of any illegal  or  proscribed
        groups. The change of attitude  is  demonstrated  by  the  fact  the
        authorities are willing to permit former members  of  the  PKK,  the
        most violent of the  Kurdish  opposition  groups  and  a  proscribed
        terrorist operation to return and live in Turkey without arrest  and
        detention, based upon past activities if  they  renounce  the  same.
        These individuals have done far more to hurt the Turkish  State  and
        members of the security services than this Appellant.


    41. The concerns expressed at the outset of the process of  joining  the
        European Union that action  was  needed  to  prevent  abuse  by  the
        security services is a well founded comment, but the  same  material
        reflects positive developments in  relation  to  the  actions  taken
        although it is accepted that all is not as a neutral observer  would
        like it to be.  This is not, however the test. As UNHCR reminded the
        Respondent in the earlier correspondence, the test to be applied has
        a number of difference components. The first for which is  the  need
        for the Respondent to demonstrate change which  is  fundamental  and
        durable. I find this element to be proved as change in  relation  to
        the attitude and treatment of Kurds in Turkey is amply  demonstrated
        by the country material. I find it to be a fundamental change as  it
        represents a change in not only engaging this group in dialogue  and
        negotiations, but in relation to the perception of risk to the State
        and  recognition  that  not  all  Kurds,  be  they  members   and/or
        supporters of legal groups or  not,  pose  a  threat  that  requires
        detention and ill treatment during such detention. There  are  those
        that still face such suspicion and it may be  the  case  that  those
        with influence or in a position of  leadership  in  an  organisation
        perceived as a threat still remain at risk at this time, but that is
        not the profile of this Appellant.


    42. In relation to the issue of whether such change is  durable,  it  is
        not possible to know what is likely to happen in the distant future.
         This is an issue that can only be assessed by a careful examination
        of not only the changes that have occurred but also the  reason  for
        such changes.  One of the reasons for the delay in the  promulgation
        of this determination has been due to the  situation  in  Syria  and
        developments in relation to the town  of  Kobane  and  the  question
        whether the situation for Turkey  in  relation  to  its  refusal  to
        support the Kurds in that town from  IS  forces  will  result  in  a
        deterioration in  the  general  situation.  In  this  regard  it  is
        reported  there  have  been  demonstrates  by   some   against   the
        governments position which have resulted  in  interventions  by  the
        police although in October Turkey allowed some 150 Kurdish Peshmerga
        forces to cross its border and help defend the Syrian town.  On  the
        basis of the available information it has not been  shown  that  the
        situation is likely to render the fundamental changes to date not of
        a durable nature. The Turkish Government clearly  see  the  proposed
        membership of the EU as being beneficial  to  its  long  terms  aims
        which appears to be a key driving force in the reforms to date.


    43. The additional element of the test is that the changes need to  have
        been shown to remove the basis of the fear of persecution. As stated
        above Mr Cakmak was granted refugee status as a result of  it  being
        found he faced a real risk on return as  a  result  of  his  Kurdish
        ethnicity and his ill treatment in detention  following  arrest.  He
        also claims to have been a supporter/sympathiser of HADEP.


    44. Miss Rutherford submitted that any  assessment  of  risk  on  return
        would have to be undertaken in light of the current country guidance
        case law. As a legal statement this is correct and an assessment  of
        risk by reference to such factors will demonstrate whether the  fear
        of persecution has been removed or not.


    45. In IA and others (Risk-Guidelines-Separatist) Turkey CG [2003] UKIAT
        00034 (also known as ACDOG) it was held that an  Adjudicator  needed
        to consider:


        i)    The level, if any,  of  the  Appellant's  known  or  suspected
            involvement with a separatist organisation.


        ii)   Whether the Appellant has ever been arrested or  detained  and
            if so in what circumstances.


        iii)  Whether the circumstances of the Appellant's past arrests  and
            detentions, if any, indicate that the authorities did  in  fact
            view him or her as a    suspected separatist.


        iv)   Whether the Appellant  was  charged  or  placed  on  reporting
            conditions or now faces charges.


        v)    The  degree  of  ill-treatment  to  which  the  Appellant  was
            subjected in the past.


        vi)   Whether the Appellant has family connections with a separatist
            organisation such as KADEK or HADEP or DEHAP.


        vii)  How long a period elapsed between the Appellant's last  arrest
            and detention  and  his  departure  from  Turkey.  Whether  the
            Appellant was under surveillance or monitored  after  his  last
            arrest.


        viii) Kurdish ethnicity.


        ix)   Alevi faith.


        x)    Lack of a current up-to-date Turkish passport.


        xi)   Whether there is any evidence that the authorities  have  been
            pursuing or otherwise expressing an interest in  the  Appellant
            since he or she left Turkey.


        xii)  Whether the Appellant became  an  informer  or  was  asked  to
            become one.


        xiii) Actual or perceived political activities abroad in  connection
            with a separatist organisation.


        xiv)  Whether the Appellant is a military draft evader.


    46.  These  factors  should  not  be  treated  simply  as  a  checklist.
        Assessment of the claim must be in  the  round  and  none  of  these
        factors is necessarily determinative of the issue.  In  relation  to
        the individual elements I find as follows:


        i)    The level, if any,  of  the  Appellant's  known  or  suspected
            involvement with a separatist organisation - it was accepted by
            Adjudicator Lloyd that the Appellant had worked for 18 years in
            local government in Turkey, but found to be  scarcely  credible
            that he would have been able to spend such a period of time  in
            that employment yet at the same time  claiming  the  government
            persecuted him, but that he was  a  supporter  of  the  Kurdish
            cause. There is no evidence the  Appellant  held  any  rank  or
            office within HADEP and his evidence  to  the  Adjudicator  was
            that he attended political meetings and worked for HADEP  which
            he claimed in 2002 to be an illegal organisation.   He  claimed
            he could not become a member of HADEP as this was  not  allowed
            as a local government worker.


        ii)   Whether the Appellant has ever been arrested or  detained  and
            if so in what circumstances - the claim before the  Adjudicator
            was to have been arrested on many occasions  between  1988  and
            2000.  His evidence to the Adjudicator, however, as recorded in
            the determination, was that after the 2000 Nevroz  celebrations
            he was detained and seriously ill treated as a result of  which
            he suffered wounds to his chest, head and arm.  He  claimed  to
            have been arrested along with  others  because  the  government
            said the celebrations for the Kurdish  New  Year  were  illegal
            after which he was detained for four and a half  months.   When
            attending the same celebrations in 2001  the  police  tried  to
            disperse the crowd using violence. The Appellant stated to  the
            Adjudicator that he was frightened he will  be  arrested  as  a
            result of which he ran away and did not return to his  home  or
            his employment. The Appellant told the Adjudicator of  previous
            ill-treatment in police detention in 1993 when he was  arrested
            for the murder and detained for 14 months  although  eventually
            released when the actual perpetrator was arrested, during which
            time he was ill treated.  Although  attendance  at  the  Nevroz
            celebrations  or  demonstrations  of  Kurdish  ethnicity   were
            outlawed by the Turkish authorities in the past this is not the
            case presently and there is no indication of a wish  to  revert
            to the previous restrictive practices in the future.


        iii)  Whether the circumstances of the Appellant's past arrests  and
            detentions, if any, indicate that the authorities did  in  fact
            view him or her as  a     suspected  separatist  -  it  is  the
            Appellant's own evidence that one period of  detention  related
            to alleged criminal activity as  he  was  suspected  of  having
            committed a murder although his claim this was only as a result
            of his Kurdish ethnicity is not substantiated on  the  material
            available. He was detained along with a  number  of  others  in
            2000 although thereafter released without charge or evidence of
            any bail conditions. In relation to release without charge;  in
            the case of Fatih Andic [2004] EWCA Civ 557 the Court of Appeal
            said that it was no flaw of reasoning to conclude from the fact
            that the applicant had been released without charge after  each
            detention that the Turkish authorities had no further  interest
            in him.  That decision was dated 4 March 2004.


        iv)   Whether the Appellant  was  charged  or  placed  on  reporting
            conditions or now faces  charges-  there  is  no  evidence  the
            Appellant was charged or  placed  on  reporting  conditions  or
            faces any outstanding  charges,  warrants,  or  other  judicial
            processes outstanding against him in Turkey.


        v)    The  degree  of  ill-treatment  to  which  the  Appellant  was
            subjected in the past  -  the  Adjudicator  accepted  that  the
            Applicant was ill treated in detention as a result of which  he
            has scarring. Such ill-treatment  is  in  accordance  with  the
            country material reflecting the brutal methods employed by  the
            Turkish security  forces  in  suppressing  the  Kurdish  ethnic
            groups or individuals at that time.


        vi)   Whether the Appellant has family connections with a separatist
            organisation such as KADEK or HADEP or  DEHAP  -  there  is  no
            evidence of family connections with  separatist  organisations.
            Such organisations have, as stated above, now ceased  to  exist
            in any event.


        vii)  How long a period elapsed between the Appellant's last  arrest
            and detention  and  his  departure  from  Turkey.  Whether  the
            Appellant was under surveillance or monitored  after  his  last
            arrest  -  there  is  no  evidence  the  Appellant  was   under
            surveillance or monitored after his last  period  of  detention
            which must have ended around September  2000.   He  felt  able,
            despite  his  experiences  in  2000  to  attend  the  New  Year
            celebration in 2001 and eventually left Turkey later that  year
            before arriving in the United Kingdom and  claiming  asylum  on
            23rd October 2001. He travelled  to  a  named  village  and  to
            Istanbul before travelling to the United Kingdom.


        viii) Kurdish ethnicity - the Appellant is of Kurdish ethnicity.


        ix)   Alevi faith - the Appellant did not claim there is any risk as
            a result of being a member of the Alevi faith.


        x)    Lack of a current up-to-date Turkish passport - the  Appellant
            does not have an up-to-date Turkish passport and  it  has  been
            confirmed that he has not made an application  to  the  Turkish
            authorities for his passport to be renewed. He will, therefore,
            be returned on an emergency travel document.


        xi)   Whether there is any evidence that the authorities  have  been
            pursuing or otherwise expressing an interest in  the  Appellant
            since he or  she  left  Turkey  -  there  is  no  evidence  the
            authorities have  been  pursuing  or  otherwise  expressing  an
            adverse interest in the Appellant since he left  Turkey.  Other
            members of his  family  have  travelled  to  Turkey  since  and
            returned without  any  evidence  of  adverse  interest  in  the
            Appellant, or them as family members from the authorities, such
            as to indicate an ongoing risk.


        xii)  Whether the Appellant became  an  informer  or  was  asked  to
            become one - there is no evidence the Appellant  was  asked  to
            become an informer or became one.


        xiii) Actual or perceived political activities abroad in  connection
            with a separatist organisation - there is no  evidence  of  any
            actual or perceived political activities in the United  Kingdom
            in connection with a separatist organisation.


        xiv)  Whether the  Appellant  is  a  military  draft  evader  -  the
            Appellant is not a military draft evader.


    47. As stated above, this is not a checklist, and  it  is  necessary  to
        assess any risk to the Appellant cumulatively. It is clear from  the
        guidance provided in the case law that the  starting  point  in  all
        cases is to consider the question of any risk  in  relation  to  the
        Appellant's home area. The Adjudicator notes that when the Appellant
        left Turkey his wife remained in his home area, Aksaray,  indicating
        he felt it was safe enough to leave the family there rather than for
        them to flee to a place of safety with him. It has  not  been  shown
        this is an area in which  there  is  a  heightened  risk  for  those
        originating from there and there  is  no  credible  evidence  of  an
        ongoing interest in him in that area. In response to questions posed
        by the Secretary of State as  part  of  the  immigration/deportation
        process, the Appellant indicates that that is his mother's home area
        and has provided a residential address for her. This  area  is  also
        stated to be the Appellant's place of birth in Turkey.  It  is  also
        of note that in 2001 when the police tried to  disperse  the  Nevroz
        celebrations the Appellant claims to have fled. He was not  arrested
        or detained by the police and there is no evidence  of  any  adverse
        interest being taken in him that necessitated a need to leave Turkey
        to come to the United Kingdom. At that time he had been released for
        nearly 8 months with no evidence of ongoing adverse  interest  being
        taken in him.  It has not been  established  that  the  computerised
        records to which the Immigration and Security Services  have  access
        on return contain any material sufficient to create a real  risk  to
        the Appellant on return. As he will be returned on a one-way  travel
        document he may be questioned  at  the  airport  and  he  cannot  be
        expected to deny a fundamental aspect of his personal identity  such
        as his ethnicity or belief in the Kurdish  cause.  If  this  prompts
        checks to be made it has not  been  shown  that  there  is  anything
        recorded  that  will  lead  to  a  real  risk  of  ill-treatment  or
        persecution. As stated, being a Kurd per se does not  give  rise  to
        risk on return and the Appellant's profile is not such that he falls
        within the categories of those in relation to whom such risk can  be
        found.  The evidence does not objectively substantiate  a  claim  to
        face a credible real risk of any adverse ill-treatment in  his  home
        area. As this is the case it is likely he can  return  to  his  home
        area or elsewhere in Turkey, if he so chooses, as no real  risk  has
        been established elsewhere either.


    48. This is the case even if the GBTS system has no  record  and  checks
        are made of the home area. Records may be held of  a  lawful  arrest
        and detention in relation to the criminal proceedings but  also  his
        release without charge. If the detention following the  2000  Nevroz
        celebration was lawful and recorded it will also show the  Appellant
        was released without charge or conditions.


    49. On return the Appellant may be asked about the reason he left Turkey
        and his activities in the United Kingdom in the interim. His account
        is as set-out above that he left  in  2001  to  avoid  the  risk  of
        further  arrest  and  ill-treatment.  The  attendance  at  a  Nevroz
        celebration is no longer illegal and it has not been shown  such  an
        event  will  create  a  real  risk  as  vast  numbers  attend   such
        celebrations annually now with no evidence of  intervention.   There
        is no evidence of any adverse activity in the UK.  This is not  case
        of an individual who was a member of the PKK or has family  in  that
        organisation and his attendance at HADEP meeting was  prior  to  the
        time the PKK flag was displayed at that organisations meetings and a
        hard line adopted in relation to the same.   It cannot be said  that
        the likely consequences of the Appellant's answers will result in  a
        real risk of ill-treatment. It is more likely he will  be  permitted
        to enter Turkey and proceed to his home area or elsewhere.


    50. In conclusion: in relation to the Secretary of State's  decision  to
        cease refugee status for the Appellant and I find that the Secretary
        of State has discharged the burden of proof upon her to the required
        standard to show that the nature of the changes in Turkey  are  such
        that the test in law, set out with clarity in the letter from UNHCR,
        in relation to this Appellant is met.


    51. Miss Rutherford raised an additional issue  at  the  hearing  namely
        that relating to Article 8; claiming the panel's findings in Article
        8 have been challenged but no decision made upon the same. Article 8
        was specifically referred to by the panel and the situation  of  the
        Appellant's wife  and  children  carefully  examined  leading  to  a
        finding that the decision would not lead to a breach of Article 8 as
        the family and private life relied upon did not outweigh the  public
        interest in deportation. The challenge to the Article 8 findings has
        been dealt with  for  in  the  error  of  law  finding  document  it
        specifically states that all findings other than those  relating  to
        the adequacy of the changes recorded in country conditions shall  be
        preserved. This includes the dismissal of the  claim  on  Article  8
        grounds.  Although  it  is  said  there  has  been   a   change   in
        circumstances in that Mr Cakmak has returned to the family  home  it
        would be necessary to assess any Article 8 claim by reference to the
        Immigration Rules which have been amended since the introduction  of
        section 117A-D into the  2002  Act.  The  amendments  to  the  Rules
        reflect the wording of the statutory provisions.  In relation to the
        offence which the Appellant committed, for which he was sentenced to
        seven years imprisonment for rape and false imprisonment, it has not
        been established on the facts that he is able to succeed  under  the
        Rules by reference to the appropriate legal tests even if this was a
        live issue before the Upper Tribunal and his wife and  children,  as
        British citizens, remain in the United  Kingdom.  The  risk  of  re-
        offending referred to in Miss Rutherford's grounds is  one  but  not
        the determinative issue. This is an automatic deportation case for a
        serious offence with  a  strong  element  of  deterrent  and  public
        revulsion.


Decision

    52. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. That decision
        has been set aside. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is
        dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    53. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
