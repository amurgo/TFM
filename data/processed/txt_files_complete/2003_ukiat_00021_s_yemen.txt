Mr J Jones, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer appeared  on  behalf  of
the appellant and Dr S A Kaballo, representative  from  West  Midlands  Anti
Deportation, appeared on behalf of the respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department.
      The respondent is  a  citizen  of  Yemen.     The  appellant  appeals
      against the decision of an Adjudicator,  Mr  D  Borsada,  sitting  at
      Birmingham, who in a determination promulgated on  13  January  2003,
      allowed an appeal by the  respondent  against  the  decision  of  the
      appellant on 12 July 2002,  to  direct  his  removal  after  refusing
      asylum.

2.    The Adjudicator dismissed the respondent's asylum claim  but  allowed
      the appeal on the basis of his human rights claim under Articles 3, 5
      and 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of  Human  Rights
      and Fundamental Freedoms.

3.    The basis of the respondent's claim is that he fears persecution from
      the members of a family who all wished to kill him.   They wished  to
      kill him because his brother killed one of their family members.   In
      Yemen, if family members are killed, then the  other  family  members
      will seek revenge by killing people from the killer's family.

4.    Mr Jones submitted that the Adjudicator had allowed the  respondent's
      appeal under Article 3 for reasons he has given in  paragraph  27  of
      his determination.   In doing so the Adjudicator  relied  on  the  US
      State Department Report, but he failed to properly evaluate  all  the
      evidence.    There was no evidence before this Adjudicator  that  the
      respondent had any political opinions.    There is no  evidence  that
      on return he will face any interrogation, because he has already been
      convicted and sentenced. According to the US State Department Report,
      there have been numerous allegations and there is credible  evidence,
      that in past years, the authorities have tortured and abused suspects
      and detainees, in cases in resulting death, in order  to  attempt  to
      coerce confessions before or during  trail.     This  respondent  has
      already been sentenced and will not, suggested Mr  Jones,  therefore,
      risk interrogation.   It was necessary, he suggested, to look at  the
      general conditions in the country.   The US State  Department  Report
      describes the prison conditions  as  being  "poor"  but  that,  would
      simply not do.   The evidence  before  the  Adjudicator  was,  to  be
      frank, insufficient to show that there would be a breach  of  Article
      3.    The Adjudicator's findings at paragraph 27 of the determination
      are simply not supported by the evidence.

5.    Mr Jones suggested that if, following the Court of Appeal decision in
      Ullah and Do [2002] EWCA  Civ  1856,  the  respondent's  claim  under
      Article 3 fails, then the claims under Article  5  and  6  must  also
      fall.   He invited the Tribunal to allow the appeal.

6.    Dr  Kaballo  conceded  that  if  a  breach  of  Article  3   was  not
      established, then the respondent's claims  under  Articles  5  and  6
      would fall.    He asked us to note that the respondent was  sentenced
      to  term  of   imprisonment   in   absentia.      The   Adjudicator's
      consideration of the US State Department Report  was  correct.     He
      drew our attention to the last paragraph of page 4 of  the  US  State
      Department Report, which referred to prison conditions being poor and
      not meeting internationally recognised standards.   He  also  pointed
      out that unauthorised private prisons are in use.    The  Adjudicator
      found  the  respondent  to  be  credible  in  paragraph  19  of   the
      determination.   If the respondent's account is consistent,  then  he
      is certainly not an ordinary person who will serve his sentence in  a
      prison.   He will have to serve  it  "under  the  history  of  tribal
      conflict".

7.    Dr Kaballo conceded that there was no evidence  that  the  respondent
      would face a real risk of interrogation on his return to Yemen.

8.    As to the general conditions, the government's human rights record is
      poor  and,  suggested  Dr  Kaballo  torture  is   practiced   despite
      government directions to the contrary.   The government has not ended
      human rights abuses.

9.    We reserved our determination.

10.   We noted from the US  State  Department  Report  that  the  judiciary
      normally independent  in  Yemen  but  can  be  severely  hampered  by
      corruption, executive branch influence and the  frequent  failure  of
      the authorities to observe judgments.  Whilst the government was said
      generally to respect it citizen's human  rights  in  some  areas  and
      continue to improve its human rights performance, however, its record
      is poor in several  other  areas  and  serious  problems  remain.   A
      directive intended to align the country's  arrest  interrogation  and
      detention  procedures  more  closely  than   international   accepted
      standards generally were implemented  during  the  year  but,  prison
      conditions were said to be poor  and  some  detainees  were  held  in
      private prisons not authorised by the government.   The  constitution
      was described as being ambiguous regarding the  prohibition  core  of
      inhuman treatment  and  members  of  the  security  forces  to  which
      otherwise abuse persons in detention.  The arresting authorities were
      known to use force during interrogations,  especially  against  those
      arrested for violent crimes.  The government were said  not  to  have
      taken effective steps to end the use of torture or  to  punish  those
      who commit such abuses.

11.   Whilst serious  problems  were  said  to  remain,  the  International
      Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  have  acknowledged  the  government's
      commitment to Penal reform and noted that the  government  have  made
      significant improvements  since  the  1995  International  Red  Cross
      Committee inspection, especially with regard to the incarceration  of
      persons with mental disabilities.

12.   We acknowledge that the prison conditions in Yemen are harsh.  We  do
      not accept, however, that on the  basis  of  the  objective  evidence
      before us, it can be  said  that  there  is  a  real  risk  that  the
      respondent will face inhumane or degrading treatment  or  punishment.
      There is no suggestion that this appellant will face the prospect  of
      having to serve his imprisonment in  a  private  prison  and  it  was
      conceded on his behalf there is no credible  evidence  that  he  will
      face  interrogation  on  his  return,  since  he  has  already   been
      convicted.  We accept that prison conditions in Yemen may not  be  as
      good as one's expected in this country. As  the  European  Court  has
      recognised, it is not  for  countries  who  are  signatories  of  the
      European Convention to impose the standards of the Convention on  the
      world.  The threshold has to be a high one.   There is a level  below
      which treatment cannot fall; where it does fall  below  the  standard
      one would expect in a civilised  society, such treatment  can  amount
      to inhumane and degrading treatment.  However, our  analysis  of  the
      objective material before us, leads us to believe that there would be
      no breach of Article 3 if the respondent is returned to Yemen.

13.   For all these reasons we allow the Secretary of State's appeal.
