                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer appealed against a decision of  Judge  N  M
    Paul of the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 9th May  2017.



 2. The Respondents before the Upper Tribunal were  the  Appellants  before
    the FTT.  I will refer to them as the Claimants.

 3. The Claimants are citizens of Nepal and are brothers born 8th September
    1986 and 9th February 1990 respectively.  On 17th September  2015  they
    applied for entry clearance in  order  to  join  their  mother  who  is
    settled in the UK.  Their mother  is  the  widow  of  a  former  Gurkha
    soldier.

 4. The applications were refused on 14th October 2015  and  the  Claimants
    appealed to the FTT.  Their appeals were heard together on  26th  April
    2017.  The FTT allowed the appeals on  human  rights  grounds,  finding
    that the decisions to refuse entry clearance breached Article 8 of  the
    1950 European Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 5. The Entry Clearance Officer applied for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Shimmin  of
    the FTT in the following terms;

          1. The Respondent seeks permission to appeal against the decision
             of First-tier Tribunal Judge N M Paul promulgated on  9th  May
             2017, allowing  the  Appellants'  appeals  against  the  Entry
             Clearance Officer's decision to refuse entry clearance.






          2. The grounds requesting  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
             Tribunal argue that the judge erred in:






               1) making a material misdirection of law in relation  to  the
                  Appellants' emotional dependency on their mother  for  the
                  purposes of Article 8;






          2) giving weight to an immaterial and speculative assertion;






          3) failing to consider the requirements of section 117B.






          3. The Respondent disagrees with the findings of  the  judge  but
             the judge heard the evidence and the findings are  capable  of
             being properly supported by the evidence and are open  to  the
             judge.






          4. With regard  to  ground  (2)  the  mother,  in  her  evidence,
             comments on the 'historical injustice'  of  Gurkha  settlement
             policy but there is no indication in the decision  as  to  any
             weight being placed on the finding  in  the  reaching  of  the
             final decision.






          5. With regard to ground (3) it is arguable the  judge  erred  in
             failing to consider the matters set out in  section  117B  and
             permission is granted on this ground alone.


Error of Law

 6. On 13th February 2018 I heard submissions from both parties in relation
    to error of law.  Mr Avery, on behalf of the Entry  Clearance  Officer,
    confirmed that there had been no further application for permission  to
    appeal, in relation to the grounds upon which permission was refused by
    Judge Shimmin.  It was therefore accepted that  the  only  ground  upon
    which permission to appeal had been granted related to section 117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).

 7. Mr Avery submitted that it  was  clear  that  the  FTT  had  failed  to
    consider section 117B, and in particular had  failed  to  consider  and
    make findings as to whether the  Claimants  could  speak  English,  and
    whether they would be financially independent.  It was  submitted  that
    these  were  important  considerations  which  must  be  considered  in
    relation to the public interest.

 8. Ms Nnamani submitted that although there was no specific  reference  by
    the FTT to section 117B, the FTT had taken  into  account  the  witness
    statements made by the Claimants in which they contend  that  they  can
    speak English.  They had also studied English at school.  The  evidence
    indicated that they were financially dependent upon  relatives  in  the
    UK.  It was submitted by Ms Nnamani that the FTT had not erred in  law,
    but in the alternative if an  error  of  law  was  found,  it  was  not
    material.

 9. I found that the FTT had materially erred in  law  and  set  aside  the
    decision.  I preserved the findings which  had  not  been  successfully
    challenged.  Full details of the application for permission, the  grant
    of permission, the submissions made by both parties, and my conclusions
    are contained in my decision dated 13th February 2018,  promulgated  on
    20th February 2018.  I set out below paragraphs 13-20 of that decision,
    which contain my conclusions and reasons  for  setting  aside  the  FTT
    decision;

         13.  When  considering  the  public  interest  in  the  context  of
             proportionality, having found that Article 8 is engaged, it is
             mandatory to consider section 117B of the  2002  Act.   In  my
             view the FTT did not do so.  There is no reference within  the
             FTT decision to section 117B.  I do not find that the decision
             indicates that the consideration set out in section 117B  have
             been taken into account.


         14.   So  far  as  the  Claimants  are  concerned,   the   relevant
             considerations in section 117B are  that  the  maintenance  of
             immigration controls is in the public interest, and it  is  in
             the public interest that a person seeking leave to  enter  the
             UK can speak English and is financially independent,  as  this
             assists integration.


         15.  It is correct that the  Appellants  stated  in  their  witness
             statements that they could speak English.   There  is  however
             little documentary  evidence  to  support  this.   The  school
             certificates included in the Claimants' bundle are dated  2003
             and 2006, and confirm that the Claimants  studied  English  at
             school at that time.  It is clear that a considerable time has
             elapsed since the Claimants attended school.


         16.  There is also within the Claimant's bundle  of  documents,  an
             undertaking of financial support from their brother-in-law  in
             the UK, who offers support "to the extent of my ability".   No
             satisfactory documentary evidence was included  to  prove  the
             ability of the brother-in-law to provide financial support.


         17.  In any event, there is no reference by the FTT to the evidence
             referred to above.   There  is  no  indication  that  the  FTT
             considered the evidence, analysed it, and made  findings  upon
             it.


         18.  In my view the error is material, because it is possible  that
             the FTT  may  have  reached  a  different  conclusion  if  the
             considerations in section 117B had been  taken  into  account.
             The decision is therefore unsafe and must be set aside.


         19.  When I indicated that I was reserving my decision on error  of
             law, Ms Nnamani submitted that if a material error of law  was
             found, it would be appropriate to give the Claimants a further
             opportunity to provide evidence in relation to  their  ability
             in English, and in relation to financial independence.


         20.  I have decided that  it  would  be  appropriate  to  give  the
             Claimants that opportunity.  The decision needs to be  remade.
             It is not appropriate to remit this appeal back  to  the  FTT.
             There will therefore be a further  hearing  before  the  Upper
             Tribunal.  The finding by the FTT that Article 8(1) is engaged
             is preserved.  The purpose of the  next  hearing  is  for  the
             Upper Tribunal to consider  the  considerations  contained  in
             section 117B of the 2002 Act.


Re-making the Decision-Upper Tribunal Hearing 26th April 2018

10. Further evidence had been submitted by the Claimants in the form  of  a
    supplementary bundle containing 49 pages.

11. At the commencement of the hearing Mr Kotas produced  the  decision  of
    the Court of Appeal in Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320 drawing my attention  to
    paragraphs 56 and 57 in which reference was made to section 117B of the
    2002 Act.  Mr Kotas advised that in view of paragraphs  56  and  57  of
    Rai, he did not intend to make any submissions that the appeals of  the
    Claimants should be dismissed.

12. Ms  Nnamani  indicated  that  she  relied  upon  the  contents  of  the
    supplementary bundle which included witness statements from the  mother
    of the Claimants, and Padam Kaucha the brother-in-law of the Claimants,
    and which also included pay slips and  bank  statements,  and  evidence
    that  the  Claimants  had  passed  an  English  language  speaking  and
    listening test.

13. I indicated that a written decision would be issued.

My Conclusions and Reasons

14. The position before the Upper Tribunal was that the FTT had found  that
    Article 8 was engaged on the basis of family life between the Claimants
    and their mother.  There had  been  no  successful  challenge  to  that
    finding.  The error of law was that the FTT  had  failed  to  give  any
    consideration to section 117B of the 2002 Act.

15. Mr Kotas referred to paragraphs 56-57 of Rai, and it is appropriate  to
    set out paragraphs 55-57 of that decision in which reference is made to
    sections 117A and 117B of the 2002 Act;

         55.   With  effect  from  28th  July  2014,  section  117A  of  the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  requires  that
             where a court or Tribunal is considering the public  interest,
             and  whether  an  interference  with  Article  8   rights   is
             justified,  it  must  have  regard,  in  cases  not  involving
             deportation, to the matters set out in section 117B, including
             that the maintenance of effective immigration  control  is  in
             the public interest (section  117B(1)),  that  it  is  in  the
             public interest that  those  seeking  entry  into  the  United
             Kingdom speak English (section 117B(2)), and that it is in the
             public  interest  that  those  seeking  entry  be  financially
             independent (section 117B(3)).


         56.  Mr Jesurum pointed out that the Upper Tribunal Judge  did  not
             consider the matters arising under  those  provisions  of  the
             2002  Act.   He  submitted,  however,  that  in  view  of  the
             'historic injustice' underlying  the  Appellants'  case,  such
             considerations would have made no difference to  the  outcome,
             and  certainly  no  difference  adverse  to  him.   Ms   Patry
             submitted that if the Upper Tribunal's decision was  otherwise
             lawfully made, the considerations arising under  section  117A
             and B could not have made a difference in his favour.


         57.  The submissions made on either side seem right.  Certainly, if
             the Upper Tribunal  Judge's  determination  is  in  any  event
             defective as a matter of law, which in my view it is, I cannot
             see how the provisions in section 117A and B of the  2002  Act
             can affect the outcome of this appeal.


16. I have taken into account the  evidence  contained  in  the  Claimants'
    supplementary bundle.  It is evident that both undertook  an  IELTS  B1
    speaking and listening test and passed this test.  The certificates are
    dated 12th April  2018.   The  test  results  indicate  a  satisfactory
    ability to speak and listen in English, though such  an  ability  is  a
    neutral factor in the balancing exercise.

17. The Claimants' brother-in-law  repeats  in  his  supplementary  witness
    statement dated 16th April 2018 his offer of financial support.  He  is
    in employment and has evidenced this by pay slips and bank  statements.
    He and his wife have savings of approximately �17,000. The  brother-in-
    law is a former Gurkha soldier.  I accept his evidence that he and  the
    Claimants' mother will ensure financial support for the Claimants  upon
    their arrival in the UK until they can find employment.

18. I have considered the need to maintain  effective  immigration  control
    and the fact that the Claimants will not have an income  of  their  own
    when they arrive in the  UK.   I  have  also  placed  weight  upon  the
    comments of Lindblom LJ at paragraphs 56-57 of Rai and the fact that Mr
    Kotas did not make  submissions  urging  that  the  Claimant's  appeals
    should be dismissed.

19. Taking all the circumstances into account including the finding by  the
    FTT that Article 8 is engaged, I conclude the decision to refuse  entry
    clearance is disproportionate and therefore breaches Article 8.

20. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal was brought  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer who is the Appellant before the Upper Tribunal, and I therefore
    conclude that the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal should be dismissed,
    which means that the appeals of the Claimants are allowed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law such that it was set aside.  I substitute  a  fresh  decision
as follows.

The appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer is dismissed.  The appeals of  the
Claimants are allowed.

There has been no request for anonymity  and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an
anonymity direction.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeals of the Claimants but  make  no  fee  award.   The
appeals have been allowed because of  evidence  presented  to  the  Tribunal
which was not before the initial decision maker.
