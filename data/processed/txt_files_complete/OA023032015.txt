Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal: thus, the Entry Clearance is once more the Respondent, and Mr
    Ahmed is the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M K P Davies (the judge), promulgated on 7  April  2016,
    in which he allowed the Appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.

 3. On 11 September 2014  the  Appellant  made  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as the spouse of a  British  citizen  (the  sponsor).   By  a
    decision dated 17 December 2014, the Respondent refused the application
    on the basis that the financial requirements of Appendix  FM  were  not
    met.  No other points were relied on in the refusal.  The marriage  had
    taken place in Pakistan on 8 December 2013.  The sponsor had a fourteen
    year-old daughter from a previous relationship,  and  they  had  always
    lived together.




Decision of the judge

 4. Having set out the general background to the appeal, at paragraph 9 the
    judge cites in full the provisions of section 117B of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  At paragraph 11 he sets out  at  some
    length passages from the Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in  SS  (Congo)
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  At paragraphs 19 and 20 the judge notes  that  no
    credibility issues had been taken against the evidence  of  either  the
    Appellant or his sponsor.  All  the  evidence  was  regarded  as  being
    credible.  The judge finds that whilst the sponsor earned in excess  of
    the threshold amount of �18,600 per annum, the particular provisions of
    Appendix FM-SE had not  been  satisfied.   This  was  accepted  by  the
    Appellant's Counsel (see paragraph  25).  Thus  the  Immigration  Rules
    could not be satisfied.

 5. The judge goes on to consider the case outside  of  the  scope  of  the
    Rules and finds that there was family life between  the  Appellant  and
    the sponsor, and that the decision interfered with the family life.  He
    then goes on to consider the core issue  of  proportionality.   At  the
    beginning of paragraph 28 he cites once again the decision in SS  Congo
    and sets out  some  basic  principles  as  to  the  importance  of  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control.  He goes on to deal  with
    the relevant aspects of section 117B.  In paragraph 30  he  deals  with
    the case of the sponsor's child.  He finds that the child was fourteen,
    was of an age where GCSEs were to be undertaken, that the  sponsor  was
    the sole carer of her child, and that the child was British. The  judge
    concludes that in all the circumstances it would not be reasonable  for
    the child to relocate to Pakistan.  It followed that if the child could
    not leave the United Kingdom, nor could the sponsor.

 6. At paragraph 31 the judge has  regard  to  the  basis  upon  which  the
    Appellant had failed to meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE.   He
    described this as being a "near miss" case, and then  immediately  goes
    on to say that this was a relevant consideration when  considering  the
    question of proportionality. The gap between the Appellant's evidential
    circumstances and the particular requirements of the Rules was  narrow,
    and thus the detrimental impact on the  public  interest  was  somewhat
    lessened in this particular case.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The Respondent's grounds of appeal are brief.  In  paragraph  2  it  is
    said that

         "Having identified that the Rules could not be met the  judge  went
         straight into Article 8 consideration without identifying  what  if
         any exceptional or compelling circumstances warranted consideration
         outside of the Rules.  The judge failed to have regard to SS  Congo
         and the position set out  therein  regarding  Article  8  in  entry
         clearance cases."

 8. In paragraph 3 the grounds state that "there are  no  findings  on  the
    quality of relationship between the Appellant and his step-daughter and
    how his continuing absence impacts the child therefore how can this  be
    considered  a  compelling  circumstance."   Paragraph  4  states   that
    "although the Sponsor earned more than the �18,600 there was nothing to
    say why the Appellant could not simply make  a  fresh  entry  clearance
    application."

 9. There is no specific challenge to the judge's conclusion that it  would
    not be reasonable for the child to leave the United Kingdom.




The hearing before me

10. The sponsor did not attend the  hearing,  nor  did  any  representative
    appear on the Appellant's behalf.   I  was  satisfied  that  notice  of
    hearing had been set out to the sponsor. There were  no  communications
    from her to indicate why she was not attending.  I note from  the  file
    that  the  Appellant  no  longer  has  legal  representatives.   Having
    considered rules 2 and 38 of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008, I
    concluded that it was fair and in the interests of justice  to  proceed
    in any event.

11. For his part Mr Tarlow relied on the grounds of appeal.  He  emphasised
    the failure of the judge to make findings  as  to  the  nature  of  the
    relationship between the Appellant and his step-daughter.




Decision on error of law

12. As I announced at the hearing, I conclude that there  are  no  material
    errors of law in the judge's decision.

13. It is clear to me that the judge had well in mind the  guidance  issued
    by the Court of Appeal in SS Congo.  The decision  is  referred  to  no
    fewer than three  times  in  the  judge's  decision,  with  substantial
    passages being set out at paragraph 11.  Indeed, at  paragraph  28  the
    judge begins his assessment of Article 8  outside  of  the  Rules  with
    express reference to SS Congo.   It  is  therefore  clear  to  me  that
    although the particular phrase "compelling circumstances" has not  been
    stated by the judge, he had this point in the front of  his  mind  when
    carrying out his Article 8 assessment.  I note too that  the  principle
    of "compelling circumstances" is not a legal test as such.

14. As to the grounds of  appeal,  in  my  view  paragraph  2  displays  an
    outdated approach to Article 8.  It is in effect  seeking  to  apply  a
    misconceived view of the approach in Gulshan (Article 8 - new  Rules  -
    correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640  (IAC).  The  hitherto  mistaken
    interpretation of this decision  has  been  highlighted  in  subsequent
    decisions of the Court of Appeal (see for example MM  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    985 at paragraph 129, and Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74, at  paragraph  64).
    The existence or otherwise of "compelling circumstances" relates to the
    outcome of any assessment outside of  the  Rules,  and  it  is  not  an
    "intermediate" or "threshold" question  as  to  whether  an  assessment
    outside the Rules should be made at all.  To this extent,  in  my  view
    the grounds are misconceived.

15. Further or in any event, the judge was fully  entitled  to  go  on  and
    consider Article 8 outside of the Rules if for  no  other  reason  than
    there was a child involved in this case.  The grounds assert  that  the
    judge has failed to make any particular findings about  the  nature  of
    the relationship between the Appellant  and  his  step-daughter.   With
    respect, my view is that this misses the point.  The real issue  relied
    upon by the judge was that the child could not reasonably  be  expected
    to leave the United Kingdom.  The judge's findings and  conclusions  on
    this point at paragraph 30 were entirely open to him.  It followed that
    if the child could not leave the United Kingdom, nor could his  mother.
    That conclusion was again clearly open to the judge.   The  absence  of
    particular findings as to the relationship between  the  Appellant  and
    the child were to that extent beside the point.

16. In my view when reading the judge's decision as a whole  the  existence
    of the child  and  the  effects  thereof  constituted  the  "compelling
    circumstance" envisaged by SS Congo.  It is true, as I  have  mentioned
    already, that the judge has not employed that particular phrase, but on
    a fair reading of this thorough decision this  is  precisely  what  the
    judge had in mind.

17. The judge's consideration of the relevant section 117B factors has  not
    been challenged in the grounds. In any event in my view these were  all
    looked at carefully and the conclusions reached were open to the judge.



18. The point in paragraph 31 about the "near miss" has not been challenged
    in the grounds, nor was it raised by Mr Tarlow before me.  In any event
    the question of whether a person has failed by narrow  margin  to  meet
    particular provisions of the Rules can nonetheless still be a  relevant
    factor in respect of an assessment of Article  8  proportionality  (see
    for example Patel [2013] UKSC 72, at paragraphs  55  to  56,  and  more
    recently JZ (Zambia) [2016] EWCA Civ 116, at paragraph 56).  The  judge
    has factored this point in as part and parcel of his overall assessment
    and has only placed fairly limited weight on the point as is clear from
    the contents of paragraph 31.  In my view even if  the  judge  was  not
    entitled so to do, this would have no material bearing on  the  overall
    soundness of his Article 8 assessment.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00, as did the previous judge. The Appellant succeeded in  his
appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  and  there  is  no  sound  reason  to
reduce an award.
