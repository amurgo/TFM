Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Devlin, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co.,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a  citizen  of  Iran,  born  on  1  April  1978.   His
    immigration history is summarised at paragraph 5  of  the  respondent's
    decision dated 11 February 2015.  That decision refused his application
    for leave to remain in the UK on the basis of his  family  and  private
    life  under  the  Immigration   Rules,   and   found   no   exceptional
    circumstances to warrant a grant of leave outside the Rules.

 2. A panel of the First-tier Tribunal  comprising  Designated  Judge  J  G
    Macdonald and Judge M  Robison  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by
    determination promulgated on 10 June 2015.



Grounds of appeal to the UT.

 3. These are the appellant's grounds:

        2. The Tribunal erred in  law  at  paragraphs  58  and  59  of  its
           decision  in  that  it  gave  manifestly  inadequate  weight  to
           relevant considerations et separatim failed to give adequate and
           comprehensible reasons.

            58. The appellant argued that considered cumulatively, the facts
                in  this  case,  and  in  particular  the  fact   that   the
                appellant's  fianc�e  is   a   British   citizen   attending
                university here,  and  the  fact  of  her  mother's  medical
                circumstances means that she relies on the appellant and his
                fianc�e for support, amount to insurmountable obstacles.

            59. We  did  not  accept  that  these  facts  amounted  to  very
                significant difficulties in  this  particular  case  to  the
                appellant and his fianc�e continuing family  life  in  Iran.
                The appellant lived in Iran for 22 years  before  coming  to
                the UK.  Although his fianc�e is a British citizen,  she  is
                also an Iranian national by  birth,  and  her  father  lives
                there, and we were told in evidence that she had visited him
                only last year ...

          The structure of paragraph 59 suggests that the Tribunal did  not
          accept that (i) the appellant's  fianc�e's  British  citizenship;
          (ii) her attendance at university here; and, (iii)  her  mother's
          reliance on her, amounted to very significant difficulties, since
          (a) the appellant had lived in Iran 22 years; (b) his fianc�e  is
          also an Iranian national by birth; (c) her  father  lived  there;
          and (d) she had visited him only last year.

          It is  not  clear  whether  the  Tribunal  considered  the  facts
          narrated in paragraph 58 to be  irrelevant  to  the  question  of
          whether there were insurmountable obstacles to  the  continuation
          of  family  life  outside  the  United  Kingdom,  or  whether  it
          considered that  the  considerations  narrated  in  paragraph  59
          reduced the weight to be given to the facts narrated in paragraph
          58 (or outweighed them).

          Either way, there is nothing in the Tribunal's  determination  to
          suggest that it properly assessed and weighed the facts  narrated
          in paragraph 58, against the considerations in paragraph 59.  The
          implication is that it gave manifestly inadequate weight to those
          facts.

          Separatim,   the   Tribunal   failed   to   give   adequate   and
          comprehensible reasons as to why it did not accept that the facts
          narrated in paragraph 58  of  its  decision  did  not  amount  to
          insurmountable obstacles  to  the  continuation  of  family  life
          outside the UK, or why the considerations narrated  in  paragraph
          59, outweighed those facts.

        3. The Tribunal erred in law at paragraph 62 et seq of its decision
           in that it failed to consider the right to  respect  for  family
           life outside the Immigration Rules.

            62. Turning to the appellant's Article 8  argument  outside  the
                Rules, Article 8 provides ...

          [The Tribunal sets out the test in and then continues:]

             66. Are there such circumstances in  this  case?   This  is  an
                 appellant who has developed a strong  private  life  having
                 lived in the United Kingdom for 15 years.

             67. The question arises as to what weight we should  attach  to
                 the appellant's private life over that period ...

          No mention is made  of  the  appellant's  family  life  with  his
          fianc�e.

          The implication is that the Tribunal considered that  all  issues
          pertaining to the right to respect  for  the  appellant's  family
          life had been adequately dealt with in its consideration  of  his
          appeal under the Immigration Rules.

          In other words , it considered that all issues pertaining to that
          right had been adequately dealt  with  in  its  consideration  of
          whether  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles   preventing   the
          continuation of family life outside the UK, for the purposes   of
          paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

          However, as Lord Eassie pointed out in Mirza (AP) v the Secretary
          of State for the Home Department [2015] ScotCS CSIH 28:

          [20]   ... in our  view,  when  it  comes  to  an  assessment  of
          proportionality, it is not appropriate to apply a test of whether
          there might be an "insurmountable obstacle" to  the  petitioner's
          wife being able to join  him  in  Pakistan.   We  are  of  course
          conscious that the phrase "insurmountable obstacle" has been used
          by the ECtHR as indicating a factor  which might  be  taken  into
          account in judging whether a decision is  disproportionate.   But
          that  was   simply   mentioned   as   a   possible   factor.    A
          disproportionate decision or measure in this field is not  to  be
          equiparated with the existence of  an  "insurmountable  obstacle"
          ...
          It follows that the test of "insurmountable obstacles" in section
          EX.1 of Appendix FM is not exhaustive of the question of  whether
          the  respondent's  decision  is  compatible  with  Article  8   -
          particularly  where (as in  this  case  and  Mirza)  one  of  the
          parties is a British citizen (see AB  (Jamaica)  v  Secretary  of
          State for the Home Department [2008] 1 WLR 1893, per Sedley LJ at
          paragraph 19).


          It follows that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to  consider
          the appellant's right to respect for his family life outside  the
          Immigration Rules.



        4. The Tribunal erred in law at paragraph 59  of  its  decision  in
           that it applied  the  wrong  test  in  determining  whether  the
           respondent's decision was incompatible with Article 8.

           Thus, at paragraph 59 of its decision said:

            60. ... we could not say in the circumstances of this case  that
                there were insurmountable obstacles to the  continuation  of
                family  life  outside  the  UK  or  that  removal  would  be
                unjustifiably harsh (my emphasis).

          The clear implication is that the test applied by the Tribunal in
          determining whether the respondent's decision was compatible with
          Article 8,  was  whether  "...  removal  would  be  unjustifiably
          harsh."

          However, in Mirza, infra, Lord Eassie said this:

          [21]   We are also of the view that counsel for the petitioner is
          well founded in his submission that insofar as the decision taker
          considered the compatibility of the refusal of leave to remain in
          the UK with Article 8 ECHR, the decision taken applied the  wrong
          test.  The  decision  taker  proceeded  upon  the  basis  whether
          refusal of leave to remain would  lead  to  "unjustifiably  harsh
          consequences".  But the issue is whether  the  interference  with
          private and family life - substantial even on the erroneous basis
          of requiring the wife to live in Pakistan - could be justified by
          the Secretary  of  State  as  proportionate  to  some  legitimate
          objective.

          It follows that,  in  asking  itself  whether  removal  would  be
          unjustifiably harsh, the Tribunal applied the wrong  test  -  or,
          alternatively,  asked  itself  the  wrong  question  (see,   Lord
          Advocate v Watt 1979 SC1).

        5. The Tribunal erred in law at paragraph 68  of  its  decision  in
           that it held that it was bound to give effect to what  was  said
           in section 117B(5) of the Nationality, Immigration & Asylum  Act
           2002.

           Thus, at paragraph 67 and 68 of its decision, the Tribunal  said
           this:

         67. The question arises as to what weight we should attach  to  the
             appellant's private life over that period of time.

         68. This is not simply a matter of our views and discretion  as  we
             are guided in this question of what Parliament has  said  -  we
             refer  in  particular  to  section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
             Immigration & Asylum Act 2002 as it now  stands  inserted  into
             the Act by section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014.

          Section 117A of the 2002 Act, provides as follows:

              2) In considering the public interest question, the  court  or
                 tribunal must (in particular) have regard -

                 (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed  in  section
                 117B ...

           Section 117A(2)(a) enjoins the Court or Tribunal  to  "...  have
           regard ... to ..." the considerations  listed  in  section  117,
           which include 117B(d):

              5) Little weight should be given to a private life established
                 by a person at a time when the person's immigration  status
                 is precarious.

           The words "... have regard to ... " should have been given their
           ordinary and natural meaning.

           They should not be equiparated with "... give effect to ..."

           Moreover, section 117A to D must be reasons for  refusal  letter
           as being subject to section 6(1) of the Human Rights  Act  1998,
           which provides:

           (1)   It is unlawful for a public authority  to  act  in  a  way
           which is incompatible with a Convention right.

           It has never been suggested in the Convention jurisprudence that
           private life established at a time when the person was in the UK
           unlawfully, or when his immigration status was precarious, is to
           be given little weight, irrespective  of  its  strength  or  the
           period for which it has endured.

           Both the former 14  year,  long  residence  concession  and  the
           current paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration  Rules,  were
           framed in order to meet  the  requirements  of  Article  8  with
           regards to respect for private life.

           By holding itself bound to give little weight to the appellant's
           private life, irrespective of its duration, or the circumstances
           in which it was formed, the Tribunal erred in law.




Submissions for appellant.

 4. Mirza had been much misunderstood, and was not  incompatible  with  any
    other authorities.  Mirza illustrated that insurmountable obstacles did
    not mean (literally) insuperable obstacles.  The Rules  were  compliant
    with the ECHR, and so not to be read in that way.  The analysis  within
    the Rules had to take account not only of the height of obstacles faced
    but such factors as a partner's UK citizenship, the length of time such
    citizenship had  been  held,  the  circumstances  under  which  it  was
    acquired, the proportion of a lifetime spent in the UK, educational and
    employment prospects  here,  and  so  on.   Paragraph  EX1  being  ECHR
    compliant required consideration of  all  relevant  facts  and  so  was
    likely to  contain  the  answer  to  almost  all  cases.   (So  far,  I
    understood from Mr Matthews this to be all common ground.)

 5. The essence of the grounds was that the panel at �58 and  59  addressed
    the central issue in an odd way, which did not explain why the  factors
    relied upon by the appellant  did  not  amount  to  a  disproportionate
    outcome.

 6. The determination then failed to say why only private  and  not  family
    life arose for any consideration outside the rules.

 7. The panel looked for insuperable obstacles or an unduly harsh  outcome,
    both of which were wrong tests.

 8. Section 117B of the 2002 Act is inherently  ambiguous.   The  UT  could
    therefore have regard to  the  Hansard  record  of  what  the  Advocate
    General for Scotland said when promoting the bill on 1 April 2014:

      Clause 18 [which became s.117B] will make  it  clear  what  Parliament
       thinks is in the public interest ... it is then for  the  courts  to
       have due regard to that when considering the  proportionality of any
       interference ..."

    Resisting the addition of the word  "normally"  into  the  clause,  the
    Advocate General further said:

      ...   little weight ... does not mean no weight ...

      Where there are other factors - such  as  the  presence  of  children,
       disability of the partner, contribution to the community or the fact
       a young adult has spent half their life in the UK and  has  no  ties
       with their country of birth - these factors  will  all  need  to  be
       weighed in the balance ...The need to have regard to  other  factors
       is reflected in the ... rules.  The case law and guidance also  make
       it clear that there may be other exceptional factors ... to be taken
       into account to ensure the decision is compatible with the ECHR.

 9. The panel said at � 69 that  section  117B(4)  "indicates  that  little
    weight  should  be  given  to  private  life  or  a  relationship   ...
    established at a time when the person is in the  UK  unlawfully".   The
    subsection is not  a  direction  or  an  instruction,  which  would  be
    incompatible with the ECHR.  The panel erred by treating it as such.

10. The determination should be set aside and  the  case  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal as the only way to arrive at "a  proper  evaluative
    exercise".

Submissions for respondent.

11. In a Rule 24 response the respondent said that  the  Tribunal  did  not
    misdirect itself as to the meaning  of  insurmountable  obstacles;  the
    grounds are mere disagreement;  and  the  Tribunal  considered  whether
    there was any case for leave outside the Rules,  but  found,  compliant
    with SS (Congo) that there were no compelling  circumstances  to  merit
    such a finding.

12. Mr Matthews further argued that the Rules,  in  particular  EX1,  being
    ECHR compliant, this was not a case which required  an  answer  outside
    the Rules.  Paragraphs 58 and  59  of  the  determination  weighed  the
    relevant factors and came to a conclusion well within the scope of  the
    panel.    If that was a sound answer, the case went  no  further.   (Mr
    Devlin conceded that would  be  correct.)   The  phrase  "unjustifiably
    harsh" might not be strictly correct,  but  that  made  no  substantial
    difference, and the panel  could  not  be  blamed  for  reflecting  the
    language of the appellant's submission to them (paragraph 48).  To  the
    extent that formulation was criticised in Mirza, all that was needed to
    correct it was to complete the sentence by an addition such as "...  so
    as to be disproportionate".  The ultimate outcome at paragraph  76  was
    well justified by the determination as a whole.   On  section  117B(4),
    the appellant read into the determination an  absolute  approach  which
    was not there.

Discussion and conclusions.

13. The appellant's grounds  and  submissions  were  long  on  the  correct
    formulation of the legal approach to family  and  private  life  cases.
    However, I did not understand there to be  any  significant  difference
    between the analysis offered by  Mr  Devlin  and  that  offered  by  Mr
    Matthews, except perhaps as to the nature of the regard which  the  FtT
    ought to have to considerations set out in statute.

14. The respondent's decision set out and applied EX.2 as well as EX.1.  It
    is instructive to quote EX2 (also  to  be  read  in  light  of  and  as
    compatible with general jurisprudence on article 8):

        ...  "insurmountable  obstacles"   means   the   very   significant
        difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their partner
        in continuing their family life together outside the UK  and  which
        could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the
        applicant or their partner.

15. The submissions were rather short on why correction of legal error,  if
    there were any, should require another  hearing,  or  lead  to  another
    outcome.  The appellant had led all  his  evidence  and  made  all  his
    submissions.  The case was there to be weighed in the balance.

16. As observed in Macdonald's Immigration Law and Practice 9th ed.  vol  1
    at 7.96 the question of the scope of article 8 has recently resulted in
    a  body  of  law  "characterised,  unhelpfully  in  our  view,   by   a
    proliferation of phrases which all  simultaneously  attempt  to  define
    thresholds and legal tests".  Particular cases, however, generally turn
    on their own facts and circumstances not on the difference between  one
    refinement of the test and another.

17. The grounds seek to deconstruct paragraphs 58 and 59 to  the  point  of
    rendering them meaningless.  However, I find it plain  that  the  panel
    was there weighing all significant factors and explaining why they were
    on balance against the appellant.  The grounds on this essential  point
    are  only  a  disagreement.   That  finding  is  sufficient   for   the
    determination to stand.

18. In any event, I would have had  no  difficulty  in  reaching  the  same
    conclusion as the panel on the facts of this case.

19. Paragraph 5 of the grounds seeks to limit the effect of part 5A of  the
    2002 Act in a way which may go rather too far.  The point  is  academic
    for present purposes.  At best it discloses no error in this case.  The
    appellant could not hope to succeed on private  life  alone.   Assuming
    the Hansard passages are admissible, and accurate as to  the  scope  of
    the provision, I see nothing  to  indicate  that  the  panel  may  have
    misunderstood.   The panel recognised that little weight does not  mean
    no weight (paragraph 74).   The self  direction  that  section  117B(4)
    gave an indication is a long way short of an  absolute  prohibition  of
    any positive finding based on private life under any circumstances.

20. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
