Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble of the Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent:    Ms H Price of Counsel instructed by Mayfair,
solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent, Navdeep Kaur (to whom I shall refer as  the  Applicant)
    is a citizen of India born on 3 May 1981.  On 4 April 2011 she  arrived
    with leave to enter as a
    Tier 4 (General) Student migrant expiring on 24 January 2014.   On  the
    same day as her leave expired she applied for further leave in the same
    capacity.

 2. The application was  supported  by  a  Certificate  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies (CAS) issued by the College of Excellence on 24 January 2014.

The Decision and Appeal

 3. On 25 March 2014 the Respondent (the SSHD) refused the application  and
    decided to remove the Appellant by way of directions under  Section  47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The basis for the
    SSHD's decision was that the CAS had been issued by  a  Legacy  Sponsor
    and so was only valid if assigned to a student who  was  re-sitting  or
    repeating a module in order to complete the course of study which  they
    had already started with the same sponsor.   The  Appellant's  previous
    course had been for a Post-graduate Diploma in  Health  &  Social  Care
    Management at the London School of Management Education.

 4. On 7 April 2014 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal under Section  82
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  as  amended.   The
    grounds refer to a letter issued to the Appellant  by  the  College  of
    Excellence which in turn refers to the SSHD's Tier 4 Policy Guidance of
    10/2013 which at page 66 states:-

         If you have an application under consideration with the Home Office
         we will process any application for leave to remain supported by  a
         CAS that your sponsor has assigned before becoming a Legacy Sponsor
         which has been made but not yet been  decided  at  the  point  your
         sponsor has become a Legacy Sponsor.

The First-tier Tribunal Determination

 5. The appeal was set for hearing in the First-tier Tribunal  on  20  June
    2014 at which both parties were represented, the Applicant by Ms Price.
     The operative part of the determination of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Steer reads:-

         At the outset of the hearing, the representatives advised  that  it
         was agreed that the appeal  should  be  allowed  outright,  as  the
         decision was not in accordance with the law, given the  failure  by
         the Respondent to advise the Appellant of the change in  status  of
         her college after she had obtained the CAS from that college and to
         thereby afford her the opportunity to obtain an alternative CAS.

    Without any further reasoning the Judge went on to allow the appeal.

 6. The SSHD sought permission to appeal on the basis that  the  Judge  had
    erred in allowing the appeal outright rather than remitting  it  for  a
    lawful decision to be made.  On 17 June 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal J M Holmes granted permission to appeal.





The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 7. There was no challenge to the Applicant's claim  that  the  College  of
    Excellence had become a Legacy Sponsor subsequent to the assignment  of
    the relevant CAS to the Applicant and before the Respondent had made  a
    decision on the Applicant's application for further leave.  Mr  Bramble
    identified a manuscript note in the SSHD's file prepared by Counsel who
    had represented the SSHD in the First-tier Tribunal.  I was  told  that
    although not all of this note easily legible it indicated that  it  was
    clear the Applicant fell  within  the  scope  of  the  Policy  Guidance
    referred to by the College and should have been given leave.

 8. Even with the benefit of Ms Price's knowledge of what had  happened  at
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing, it remained unclear to  me  from  what
    she said, from what the Judge had written in his Record of  Proceedings
    and in his determination exactly  what  had  or  had  not  been  agreed
    between the parties at the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  or  what  the
    Judge thought the parties were telling him they had agreed.

 9. Further, the determination allowed the Applicant's appeal outright  but
    failed to give any reason other than to refer to an  agreement  between
    the  parties,  the  terms  of  which  were  not  articulated   in   the
    determination.  The consequence is that the SSHD has not been  informed
    why the appeal has been allowed.  This amounts to an error of law  such
    that the determination must be set aside: see for  instance  paragraphs
    11 and 12 of MK (duty to give reasons) [2013] UKUT 641.

10. Page 66 of the SSHD's Tier 4 Policy Guidance of August 2014  is  fairly
    reflected in the college's letter of 19 May 2014 already  referred  to.
    The letter stated that a copy of the then current policy  was  attached
    but there was no copy in the Tribunal file.  Ms Price sent me a copy of
    the Policy Guidance of 10/2013 which I find is accurately reflected  in
    the College's letter. The Appellant  has  shown  that  her  application
    falls within the scope of the Policy Guidance.  In most cases, it would
    be appropriate simply to find the decision of the SSHD  not  to  be  in
    accordance with the law and leave it for the  SSHD  to  make  a  lawful
    decision:  see  AG  and  Others   (policies:   executive   discretions:
    Tribunal's powers) Kosovo [2007] UKAIT 82. Given the  accepted  factual
    basis and the absence of evidence of  any  countervailing  factors  the
    inevitable result is that the Appellant is entitled  to  further  leave
    and there is no point in requiring the SSHD to re-consider.

Anonymity

11. There was no request for an anonymity direction  or  anonymisation  and
    having heard the appeal I find there is no need for such.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
law such that it must be set aside.  The following decision is substituted:-


    The appeal of the SSHD is dismissed with the effect that  the  original
    appeal of the Applicant is allowed.

    No order as to anonymity made.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

The Applicant's appeal has been allowed and having  regard  to  the  grounds
upon which it has been allowed, I find it appropriate to make  a  fee  award
of ï¿½140.
