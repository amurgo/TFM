Representation:

Appellant:             Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


Respondent:            Mr T Shah, Solicitor, Taj Solicitors

(1)  In  an  entry  clearance  case  involving  the  issue  of  adequacy  of
maintenance, it will in  general  assist  the  First-tier  Tribunal  or,  on
appeal, the Upper Tribunal if, as part of the submission, a  calculation  is
supplied  which  reflects  the  comparison  between  the   applicant's   and
sponsor's combined projected income if the  applicant  for  entry  clearance
were in the United Kingdom on the one hand and, on  the  other,  the  amount
required to provide the maintenance at a level that can properly  be  called
adequate.

   2) Income  received  and  the  projection  for  the  figures  which  the
      applicant and sponsor have to be able to find should be expressed  on
      a consistent and arithmetically accurate basis.  Benefit  is  usually
      calculated  on  a  weekly  basis  but  is  often   paid   fortnightly
      (employment support allowance  and  income  support)  or  four-weekly
      (child benefit), while tax credits are calculated on a  daily  figure
      and paid in general weekly (child tax credit) or fortnightly (working
      tax credit). A month under the Gregorian calendar is not the same  as
      four weeks and  wrongly  taking  a  four-week  period  of  income  as
      equating to a month risks a potentially significant detriment  to  an
      applicant for entry clearance.

(3)  It is always  essential  that  regard  is  had  to  the  benefit  rates
applicable at relevant times; eg in entry  clearance  cases,  the  rates  in
force at the date of decision. The  calculation  of  the  benefit  threshold
figure is an academic  exercise,  but  establishing  the  benefits  which  a
sponsor and the applicant will actually  be  receiving  on  the  applicant's
arrival is far from it. The most compelling evidence of  receipt  of  income
by way of social security is likely to be proof of receipt of funds  into  a
person's bank account. Notices of award  are  intrinsically  less  reliable.
The position of tax credits is particularly complex.

(4)  It would assist if entry clearance application forms  were  to  include
questions  designed  to  elicit  the  information  described  above  and  if
decisions of entry clearance officers included a  calculation  described  in
(1) above.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is the determination of the Tribunal, to  which  each  member  of
the panel has contributed.

2.    The respondent is a citizen of Bangladesh.  On 30 December 2010  the
appellant (hereafter "ECO") refused his application for entry  clearance  to
join his wife and two children in the  UK.   The  respondent's  appeal  came
before Immigration Judge Majid, who allowed it by a determination  sent  on
5 August 2011.

3.    The ECO's subsequent appeal to the Upper Tribunal was successful,  in
that Upper Tribunal Judge Storey, at that point sitting  alone,  set  aside
the determination of Judge Majid, with the result that the decision  in  the
respondent's appeal needs to be re-made by  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  two
issues requiring to be determined in that regard are the  accommodation  and
the maintenance requirements in paras 281(iv) and 281(v)  of  Statement  of
Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 (as amended) by which it is  necessary
to show:

      (by (iv)) that "there will be adequate accommodation for  the  parties
and any     dependants without recourse to  public  funds  in  accommodation
which they own or      occupy exclusively"; and
      (by (v)) that "the parties will be able  to  maintain  themselves  and
any dependants   adequately without recourse to public funds."

4.     Here  reference  should  be  made  to  paras 6A  to   6C   of   the
Immigration Rules as they were in force with  effect  from  31  March  2009
which provide:

      "6A For the purpose of these Rules, a person (P) is not to be regarded
      as having (or potentially having) recourse to public funds  because P
      is (or will be) reliant in whole or in part on public  funds  provided
      to  P's  sponsor  unless,  as  a  result  of  P's  presence   in   the
      United Kingdom, the sponsor is (or would be) entitled to increased or
      additional public funds (save where such entitlement to  increased  or
      additional public funds is by virtue of  P  and  the  sponsor's  joint
      entitlement  to  benefits  under  the  regulations  referred   to   in
      paragraph 6B).

      6B Subject to paragraph 6C, a person (P) shall  not  be  regarded  as
      having recourse to public funds if P is entitled to benefits specified
      under section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 by virtue of
      regulations made under sub-sections (3) and (4) of  that  section  or
      section 42 of the Tax Credits Act 2002.

      6C A person (P) making an application from outside the United Kingdom
      will be regarded as having recourse to public  funds  where  P  relies
      upon the future entitlement to any public funds that would be  payable
      to  P  or  to  P's  sponsor  as  a  result  of  P's  presence  in  the
      United Kingdom, (including those benefits to which P or  the  sponsor
      would be entitled as a result of P's presence in  the  United Kingdom
      under the regulations referred to in paragraph 6B)."

5.    A sponsor is thus entitled to rely on  his  or  her  own  recourse  to
public funds to the extent that paragraphs 6A to 6C of the Rules provide.

6.    The re-making decision was  directed  to  be  listed  before  a  panel
comprising judges of  both  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber  and  the
Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, as  particularly  the
latter Chamber deals with matters of social security.  It was hoped that  as
well as dealing with the present case, this  might  enable  guidance  to  be
given which would be useful to members of the public in a  similar  position
to the respondent, those who advise them, the  UKBA  and  others.   As  will
become apparent, there are limits to the extent of  guidance  which  can  be
given in this case.  The complexity of the social security  system  is  such
that there is scope for points to arise on which it would not be  right  for
this Tribunal, without the benefit of  argument  from  persons  affected  by
them, to express a  view.   Nonetheless,  some  practical  guidance  can  be
given.

7.    Further, after this hearing was set up  and  following  proposals  set
out in June 2012  in  "Statement  of  intent:  Family  Migration"  the  Home
Secretary introduced new Immigration Rules to take effect  in  relation  to,
in general, any application made on or after 9 July 2012: see HC194 (9 July
2012) and subsequent amendments.  Under the new rules, for  some  categories
of applicant, in assessing maintenance a number of the sources of income  to
which reference is made in the present  decision,  such  as  child  benefit,
working tax credit and child tax credit, will no longer be  eligible  to  be
taken  into  account.   However,  for  other  categories   the   maintenance
requirements  are  unchanged.    Further,   the   process   of   determining
applications lodged before 9 July 2012 and appeals  in  relation  to  them
means  that  primary   decision-makers,   the   First-tier Tribunal,   the
Upper Tribunal and others are likely to be  concerned  with  the  practical
application of the existing rule for a while yet.

8.    As this  was  an  appeal  under  section 82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  against  a  refusal  of  entry  clearance,
section 85(5)  of  that  Act  applied  and  the  Tribunal  (and  hence  the
Upper Tribunal re-making a decision on appeal)  was  required  to  consider
only the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision  to  refuse.
(It would of course be different in the case of a decision made  in-country,
where the matter would fall to be addressed as at the date of hearing.)

9.    As regards accommodation, that matter had already  been  addressed  by
Judge Storey.  In his determination of 4 April 2012 he indicated that  he
was satisfied that the accommodation requirement was met.  Mr Saunders does
not seek to challenge that conclusion.  In those circumstances we  need  say
no more about it, save to note (as it is relevant to the calculations  which
appear below) that the sponsor (the respondent's wife)  had  been  paying  a
sum  variously  expressed  at  �50  per  week  or  �200  per  month  to  the
respondent's uncle by way of rent.

10.    The  authorities  concerning  adequacy  of  resources  were  recently
reviewed by the Upper Tribunal in  Yarce  (adequate  maintenance:  benefits)
[2012] UKUT 00425 (IAC).  The correct approach is that set  out  in  KA  and
Others (Adequacy of Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065, referring  to
the earlier decision in Uvovo (00 TH 01450), namely:

      "The appropriate method of calculation for comparative purposes is, as
      explained in Uvovo, to separate maintenance from accommodation, and to
      look first to see whether the accommodation  would  be  adequate,  and
      then to see  whether  the  income  available  to  the  Appellants  for
      maintenance is equivalent to the amount that would be available  to  a
      similar family on income support once they have dealt with the  costs
      of their accommodation."


What the Tribunal in Uvovo - and the Tribunal in KA - seeks here to  require
focus on (and what paras 6A-C require focus  on)  is  the  actual  financial
position on arrival, i.e. income  that  is  or  will  be  available  to  the
applicant and his sponsor upon his arrival in the UK  (in  the  language  of
para 6, "as a result of [the applicant's] presence in the UK"). Because  the
calculation is therefore a projection forward to  what  the  income  of  the
applicant and his sponsor is or will be on  arrival,  we  shall  employ  the
expression "projected income".



11.   As adequacy of accommodation was out  of  the  picture  following  the
earlier  decision,  the  present  hearing  was  concerned  solely  with  the
maintenance  requirement.   Expressed  mathematically,  the  formula  to  be
fulfilled is

      A - B ? C[1]

where:

A is the projected income
B what needs to be spent on accommodation and
C the income support (or equivalent) figure (which we term in this  decision
"the benefit threshold")

12.   Before turning to whether this formula was fulfilled  in  the  present
case, whilst we did not receive any argument on the point, in  our  view  we
need to address how paragraphs 6A to 6C apply to a case such  as  this.   In
doing so, we are mindful that, as  was  said  in  Mahad  v  Entry  Clearance
Officer [2009] UKSC 16:

      "The Rules are not to be construed with all the strictness  applicable
to the construction    of a statute or a statutory instrument but,  instead,
sensibly according to the natural and   ordinary meaning of the words  used,
recognising  that  they  are  statements  of  the   Secretary   of   State's
administrative policy."

13.   The first question is what does the proviso "save where"  in  para  6A
apply to?  As we read para  6A,  it  is  saying  that  all  that  counts  as
recourse to public funds is increased benefit as a result  of  P's  presence
and even that does not count if it arises  as  the  result  of  the  matters
referred to in para 6B (which includes joint applications for tax credit  of
the type with which we are concerned, the relevant  regulations  being  made
under section 42 of the Tax Credits  Act  2002  ("TCA")).   The  alternative
approach is to say that the joint entitlement cases are carved out from  the
general rule that only increases in benefit are caught.  We can think of  no
sensible reason for such an interpretation, which appears to go against  the
structure of s115 of Immigration and Asylum Act 1999  ("IAA")  and  that  of
TCA s42.

14.   Para 6B then exempts claims by P (as opposed to P's  sponsor)  to  the
specified benefits where there is joint  entitlement  (thus  confirming  the
impression  that  IAA1999  s115  and  TCA2002  s42  have,  if  anything,   a
liberalising role  and  that  the  first  rather  than  the  second  of  the
interpretations of para 6A above is likely  to  be  the  correct  one.)   In
principle, where para 6B applies, it appears to allow  not  only  the  joint
claim at the same amount but, as regards P, a joint  claim  resulting  in  a
higher amount than would previously have been  paid  to  the  sponsor  alone
(even though, as regards the sponsor, an increase in her  entitlement  under
the (now) joint claim would not be  permitted  by  para  6A  if  the  second
interpretation above were to prevail.)  It  would  be  nonsense  (acting  in
vain) for para 6B to grant something which as regards a joint claim would  -
on the second interpretation - be ruled out by para 6A.

15.   What then is the effect of para 6C?   This  applies  only  to  persons
making an application from outside the UK (as is  the  present  case).   The
question is whether para 6C is  concerned  only  with  additional  funds  or
whether it also bites where  the  level  of  funds  remains  the  same,  but
because of the joint claim provisions - such as the tax  credit  one  -  the
applicant for entry clearance will, when s/he comes to  the  UK,  inevitably
be involved in the claim and to that extent it will be "paid as a result  of
P's presence in the United Kingdom"?  Para 6C appears to provide  a  partial
disapplication of para 6B, so that  whereas  para  6B  allows  increases  in
benefit under the provisions (even though they  would  otherwise  have  been
caught by para 6A) this does not hold good in the case of applications  from
outside the UK.  An example of a situation which would be caught by para  6C
would be a spouse and child coming  from  abroad  which  would  (unlike  the
present situation where the children are already here) lead to  an  increase
in the amount claimed and so be precluded by para 6C.   Indeed,  it  may  be
that  para  6C  is  confined  to  cases  where  there  are  at  present   no
entitlements to benefits, which may be the case so  far  as  a  hypothetical
applicant is concerned in an out of country case (though not necessarily  of
course where there is a United Kingdom sponsor.)  The explanatory  notes  to
HC 314, which inserted paras 6A to 6C into the Rules in 2009, speak at  para
7.19 of 6C concerning "anticipated entitlement to public funds".



Income

16.   As in Yarce, the present case requires an examination in the light  of
the above principles of the effect, if any, of the arrival of  an  applicant
for entry clearance upon a sponsor's entitlement to claim benefits and  thus
on the resources available.  We are satisfied that as at  30 December 2010
(the date of decision), the sponsor's income ("A" in the  formula  in  [11])
was (employing standard rounding principles) as follows:

|Income source          |Interval received      |Equivalent weekly      |
|                       |                       |amount                 |
|Net salary from        |Weekly                 |�161.30                |
|employment             |                       |                       |
|Working Tax Credit     |�364.71 every four     |�  91.18               |
|                       |weeks Divided by 4=    |                       |
|Child Tax Credit       |Weekly                 |�  93.99               |
|Child Benefit          |�134.80 every four     |�  33.70               |
|                       |weeks Divided by 4 =   |                       |
|Total                  |                       |�380.17                |

17.   We are further satisfied that, as at that date, there  was  no  reason
to suppose that the sponsor's employment was other than  permanent  or  that
her salary was not likely to continue at at least that level.   While  there
are changes in benefit and tax credit rates from time to time,  we  consider
that it will  in  general  be  appropriate  to  apply  rates  that  were  in
existence at the date of decision, though the point may need  to  be  looked
at further in a case where a party contends for a different  rate  to  apply
(compatibly with section 85(5):[8] above).

18.   Turning to  the  effect  on  the  sponsor's  benefit  income,  if  the
respondent had notionally been here as at 30 December 2010,  the  answer  is
that there would have been none.  Let us set this out in more detail.

Tax credits

19.   If the respondent were here, the sponsor and he, as a married  couple,
would have been entitled to make  a  joint  claim  for  tax  credits.   Even
though the respondent would have  been  a  "person  subject  to  immigration
control" (as defined by section  115  of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
1999), the couple's entitlement to tax credits would, so  far  as  relevant,
fall to be determined as if the respondent had not notionally  been  subject
to  such  control:  see  Tax  Credits  (Immigration)  Regulations  2003,  SI
2003/653, reg 3(2).

Child tax credit

20.   We can see no reason on the facts of this  case  (and  none  has  been
suggested) why  the  amount  of  child  tax  credit  should  have  been  any
different if the respondent had been in the  UK.   Without  limitation,  the
"family element" within the child tax credit calculation  is  unaffected  by
whether a person is claiming as a single  parent  (including  because  their
spouse is abroad) or as one of a couple.

Working tax credit

21.   Similarly, in relation to working tax  credit,  the  sponsor  claiming
alone was entitled to have taken into account in calculating the  amount  of
working tax  credit  payable  to  her  the  "lone  parent  element".   On  a
hypothetical  joint  claim  made  on  30  December  2010,  the  sponsor  and
respondent would instead have been entitled to the couple or "second  adult"
element.  This would be so despite the respondent being  a  "person  subject
to immigration control", as the sponsor and respondent would be  responsible
for a child or qualifying young person: see Working Tax Credit  (Entitlement
and Maximum Rate) Regulations 2002 SI 2002/2005.  As the value of  the  lone
parent element and that of the second  adult  element  were  the  same,  the
notional arrival of the respondent at the decision date would not have  made
any difference  to  the  amount  of  tax  credits  the  sponsor  would  have
continued to receive.

Child benefit

22.   Nor would there have been any change in the amount  of  child  benefit
she would have continued to receive, which is determined by  the  number  of
children (or qualifying young persons) for whom a person is responsible  and
not by the number of adults in the family unit.

23.   It follows that the  figures  in  the  table  above  would  have  been
unaffected by the arrival  of  the  respondent  and,  on  the  circumstances
prevailing at 30 December 2010, were set fair to be provided on  an  assured
basis (cf. Mahad (Ethiopia) v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16.)

Accommodation Costs

24.   On the unchallenged evidence, the sponsor had to  pay  �50  weekly  on
rent and nothing on council tax, thus the figure arrived at for "A -  B"  in
the formula is �330.17 (i.e. �380.17-�50).

Housing and Council Tax Benefit

25.   Although housing benefit and council tax benefit may  require  careful
consideration in other cases (see the discussion in Yarce at [57]  -  [61]),
they are not relevant in the  present  case,  as  the  sponsor  was  not  in
receipt of them.

The Benefit Threshold

26.   The calculation of the benefit  threshold  derived  from  figures  put
forward by the respondent's  solicitor  was  as  follows  (all  figures  for
benefits are, correctly, those for 2010/11,  in  which  the  decision  under
appeal was taken):

|Element                |Interval               |Amount                 |
|Income Support Rate for|Weekly                 |�102.75                |
|a couple               |                       |                       |
|Each dependent child   |Weekly                 |�115.14                |
|from birth to age of   |                       |                       |
|20, �57.57 x 2         |                       |                       |
|Family premium         |Weekly                 |�  17.40               |
|Total                  |Weekly                 |�235.29                |

27.    This  calculation  in  the  form  put  forward  is  not  without  its
conceptual difficulties, though they may  be  more  theoretical  than  real.
The system of support for families on  benefit  with  children  has  largely
moved on and will continue to do so.  The calculations as  submitted  to  us
are sufficiently consistent  with  KA  for  present  purposes,  and  we  are
satisfied  that  other,  more  contemporary,   ways   of   approaching   the
calculation (such as using child tax credit figures) would  not  lead  to  a
materially  different  outcome  when  considering  the  benefit   threshold.
However, while we are satisfied that the present method of carrying out  the
calculation is a valid one in the circumstances of this  case,  we  are  not
intending to hold it  out  as  a  model  or  to  exclude  other  methods  of
calculation  which  respect  the  KA  principle  while  perhaps  being  more
consistent with the reality of the benefit system as it  now  is  or  indeed
with how it may evolve in the  future.   The  aim  always  is  to  effect  a
comparison between the applicant's and sponsor's combined  projected  income
if the applicant for entry clearance were in the UK on the one hand and,  on
the other, the amount required to provide the maintenance "at a level  which
can  properly  be  called  adequate"  (KA,   para 6)   by   reference   to
income support levels or, where applicable, other aspects  of  the  benefit
system which may have taken its place (i.e. the benefit threshold).

28.   In para 17 of  the  decision  in  KA,  the  Tribunal  alluded  to  the
potential for other costs to fall to be taken into account  because  of  the
"passporting" effect of income support, such as the  cost  of  prescriptions
which might fall to be provided by the National Health Service and the cost
of other benefits such as free school  meals.   In  the  present  case,  the
children of the respondent and sponsor were aged 1 and  3  at  the  date  of
decision, so the latter is not applicable.  No specific  point  about  these
or other costs has been raised on behalf of the ECO. Further, we  note  that
the definition of "public funds" (see para 6 of the Immigration Rules)  does
not, in terms, refer to advantages  to  which  income  support  might  be  a
passport.  Suffice it in the present case to say that we are satisfied  that
at the relevant date, the sponsor had sufficient resources  to  be  able  to
maintain her  family,  including  the  respondent,  using  only  such  State
resources as the Immigration Rules in force at the material time  permitted
to be used.  Even if other factors such  as  prescription  charges  were  to
fall to be taken into account, the difference in the  present  case  (around
�95 per week to the good)  between  the  sponsor's  income  and  what  would
otherwise  be  the  benefit  threshold  is  on  any  view  likely  to  prove
sufficient and no suggestion has been made otherwise by Mr Saunders.

29.   From the above it will  be  clear  that  we  are  satisfied  that  the
respondent's projected income, net of accommodation costs, of  �330.17  will
be greater than the benefits  threshold  relevant  to  his  case  (�235.29).
Accordingly we are satisfied that the respondent merits the benefit  of  the
Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended).

Submissions in cases of this type

30.   The experience of Judges Storey  and  Lane,  whose  home  jurisdiction
this is, is that parties may be assisted by guidance as to how evidence  and
submissions in appeals raising these questions might be presented so  as  to
assist the First-tier and Upper Tribunals.  In an immigration appeal  it  is
of course the party who seeks to claim the benefit of the Immigration  Rules
on whom the burden rests of proving, on the balance of  probabilities,  that
the relevant requirements are met.  As we observed in Yarce at [46]:

      "It seems to us that, since these issues involve mixed fact  and  law,
    an appellant in an immigration appeal must be able  to  demonstrate  to
    the judicial fact-finder, either that the actual financial position  on
    arrival will be such as to make it unnecessary to rely upon benefits in
    order to provide a standard of living equivalent to that  available  on
    means  tested  benefits,  or  that  the  relevant  law  bears  on   the
    circumstances of the family, in such  a  way  that  there  will  be  no
    additional recourse to public funds in doing so."

31.   It will in general assist a First-tier Tribunal, or  on  appeal,  the
Upper Tribunal if as part of a submission a calculation is  supplied  which
reflects the comparison summarised in [27] above.  Income received  and  the
projection for the figures which the appellant and sponsor have to  be  able
to find should be expressed on  a  consistent  and  arithmetically  accurate
basis.  It should not be for the  Tribunal  to  have  to  do  the  necessary
calculations to achieve this.  Benefit is usually  calculated  on  a  weekly
basis but  at  present  is  often  paid  fortnightly  (generally  employment
support allowance and income support) or four-weekly (child benefit)  while
tax credits are calculated on a daily figures and  paid  in  general  weekly
(child tax credit) or four-weekly (working tax credit).  A month  under  the
Gregorian calendar is not the same as four weeks and wrongly taking a  four-
week  period  of  income  as  equating  to  a  month  risks  a   potentially
significant detriment to an applicant for entry clearance  (as  occurred  in
the present case, although on the facts it did not affect the result).

32.   Information  on  benefit  rates,  including  historic  rates,  can  be
obtained from a variety of sources.  Those who practise in  social  security
or who have colleagues who do will already be aware of the Welfare  Benefits
and Tax Credits Handbook published  by  Child  Poverty  Action  Group  which
contains (among much other useful material) a table of such figures  at  the
beginning  and  which  is  published  annually,  while  a  table  of  rates,
including for past years, is available online at  www.rightsnet.org.uk.   It
is always essential, of course, that regard is  had  to  the  benefit  rates
applicable at the relevant times, i.e. in entry clearance cases,  the  rates
in force at the date of decision, but in in-country appeal cases,  those  in
force at the date of hearing.

33.   The calculation  of  the  benefit  threshold  figure  is  an  academic
exercise, but establishing the benefits which a sponsor and  applicant  will
actually be receiving on the applicant's arrival is far from it.   In  terms
of the evidence to prove receipt of income by way of  social  security,  the
most compelling evidence is likely to be proof of the receipt of funds  into
a person's bank account.  Most, though not all, payments are made in such  a
way.  Payments from DWP and HMRC, so far as we are aware, are identified  as
such on bank statements.  Notices of award, while they may have some  value,
are intrinsically less reliable, because of the wide  ranging  powers  which
the Secretary of State for Work and  Pensions  and  in  the  non-tax  credit
context HMRC  have  to  change  decisions  by  processes  of  "revision"  or
"supersession" and because of the scope for  a  decision  to  be  changed  -
sometimes against a person claiming benefits - on  appeal,  thus  any  given
decision notice may not be the last one in the sequence.   The  position  of
tax credits is a particularly complex one in  decision-making  terms,  which
may involve the use of estimated amounts and  sums  paid  on  a  provisional
basis, followed by a process of reconciliation and final decision after  the
end of the tax year.

34. Finally, as for the reasons above it is necessary to establish  whether,
at the date of the decision under appeal, there would be any effect  on  the
sponsor's entitlement to benefit if he or she  were  to  be  joined  by  the
applicant for entry clearance, it is our view  that  application  forms  for
entry clearance should include questions designed to elicit the  information
we have described above and that ECO decisions should include a  calculation
utilising the heads of calculation which we have outlined. In  addition,  in
the context of appeals submissions  should,  accordingly,  include  a  legal
analysis addressed to these matters.

Decision

35. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal having been set  aside,  we
hereby re-make the decision as follows:
The respondent's appeal against the decision of the entry clearance  officer
is allowed.

Representation
For the appellant/ECO:   Mr  N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent/claimant:    Mr T Shah, Solicitors, Taj Solicitors

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.       The  respondent  (hereafter  "the  claimant")  is  a   citizen   of
    Bangladesh. On 30 December 2010 the appellant (hereafter "ECO") refused
    his application for entry clearance to join his wife and  two  children
    in the UK. The ECO considered (1) that he fell foul of para 320(7A)  of
    Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC395 as amended for failing
    to disclose his previous immigration history; (2) that he did not  meet
    the requirements of the substantive immigration rule (paras 281(iv) and
    281(v) of HC395 as amended) by virtue of the fact that it had not  been
    shown that adequate accommodation would be genuinely available or  that
    there would be adequate maintenance. The ECO also found that to  refuse
    him entry clearance would not violate his  Article  8  ECHR  rights.  I
    should clarify that the claimant had been the  subject  of  a  previous
    refusal  of  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse  which  he  had   appealed
    unsuccessfully.

2.      The claimant's appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  (FTT)  Judge
    Majid. There was no representation from the  ECO.  In  a  determination
    sent on 5  August  2011  Judge  Majid  allowed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

3.     In grounds seeking permission to appeal the ECO did not  dispute  the
    judge's rejection of the para 320(7A) basis for refusal.  Nor  did  she
    challenge the judge's primary findings of fact (he found  the  claimant
    and sponsor credible and genuine). Her challenge was  confined  to  the
    FTT  judge's  reasons  for  concluding  that  the  claimant   met   the
    accommodation   and   maintenance   requirements.   In   relation    to
    accommodation, it was contended that the judge had wrongly  taken  into
    account post-decision evidence given at the hearing that  the  claimant
    had now moved to a three bedroom flat.

4.      I have no hesitation in  deciding  that  the  FTT  judge  materially
    erred in law. In relation to the accommodation requirement, he gave  no
    reasons whatsoever for his conclusion at para 26 that the accommodation
    requirement was "fulfilled". In refusing the claimant's application the
    ECO had considered the sponsor's evidence that  she  had  a  new  three
    bedroom flat for which she was required to pay �200 per month in  rent,
    but had concluded that he had failed to provide evidence to demonstrate
    that the rental commitments were being met. It was also noted that  the
    claimant had failed to address  adequately  the  concerns  relating  to
    accommodation expressed by the previous immigration judge. Against this
    background it was clearly insufficient simply for the FTT judge to find
    that the accommodation requirement was met because what she  said,  she
    said "credibly". That failed to address the respondent's concern at the
    lack of any evidence to demonstrate that the  rental  commitments  were
    being met  or  that  she  had  indeed  moved  as  claimed  to  the  new
    accommodation. (an address in Headley Drive, Ilford, Essex). As regards
    maintenance, whilst in this regard the FTT judge did  give  some  brief
    reasoning, it simply amounts to his  finding  without  any  explanation
    that as she received an increase in her salary in April 2011,  so  that
    it went up from �161.30 p.w. to �167.80 p.w.,  the  claimant's  arrival
    was not going to cost anything to public funds (see  paras  1-20,  26).
    Taken together these failed amount to a material error of law and cause
    me to set aside the FTT decision.

   5.    In seeking to re-make the only two issues  before  me  concern  the
      accommodation and maintenance requirements.


   Accommodation
   6.    In relation to  the  accommodation  requirement,  the  ECO  in  the
      refusal letter stated that the claimant had "provided no evidence that
      the rental commitments are being met". But in point of fact  (although
      the FTT judge did not touch upon it) the ECO was wrong about that.  In
      his application the claimant had identified the three bedroom  address
      in Headly  Drive  as  the  proposed  accommodation  and  he  had  also
      submitted a letter from the claimant's uncle, Mr K H Masud, confirming
      that he was the owner of this address and that the  sponsor  had  been
      living at this address with her two children paying �200 per month  in
      rent. The  sponsor  had  also  submitted  a  house  inspection  report
      confirming that the property would be suitable for a couple with three
      children. The sponsor had also stated in her  sponsorship  declaration
      that she lived at the three-bedroom property, that Mr  Masud  was  the
      owner of this property and that the rent she paid was �200 per  month.
      Nothing said at  the  hearing  before  the  FTT  cast  doubt  on  this
      evidence. Mr Bramble before me sought at one point to raise  the  fact
      that the house inspection report described Mr Masud as a landlord, but
      there was nothing  inconsistent  with  this  gentleman  being  both  a
      landlord and the owner and this was not a point that had  been  relied
      upon by the respondent either in the refusal or  the  grounds  seeking
      permission.  Accordingly  I  am  satisfied  that   the   accommodation
      requirement was met.


   Maintenance
   7.   In relation to the maintenance requirement, however, things are less
      straightforward. In her grounds seeking permission to appeal  the  ECO
      raised a new point not relied upon in her the refusal  decision;  that
      new point related to the level of the  sponsor's  reliance  on  public
      funds. However, given that the claimant was put on  notice  of  it  in
      advance of the hearing I do not consider there has been any procedural
      unfairness and, the new point relates to a  mandatory  requirement  of
      the Immigration Rules, I am obliged to determine it.

   8.    In more detail the new point had two limbs. First it was  contended
      that it would be wrong to take into account  (as  the  FTT  judge  had
      done) the post-decision level of earnings of the sponsor,  which  were
      167.80 per week. Rather the relevant figure was  the  amount  she  was
      earning at the date of decision in December 2010,  which  was  �161.30
      per week. Second, it was argued that even  if  the  new  salary  level
      from April 2011 (of �167.80)  was treated as the correct figure,  that
      was still not sufficient., as the income support level  for  a  couple
      with two children (of relevant ages) was �235.29 per week.


   9.   In his skeleton argument Mr Shah submitted that  the  ECO's  grounds
      for permission failed to factor in the matter  that  at  the  date  of
      decision  the  claimant  was  in  receipt  of  (1)  child  benefit(CB)
      totalling �34.37 per week  and (2) Child Tax Credits (CTCs)  totalling
      �107.66. He referred to p.11 of his bundle which stated that  "as  the
      couple  rate  [for  income  support]  was  �459.12.12  [�105.95  x  52
      weeks)/12 months] per month, therefore I have  a  monthly  savings  of
      �532.13 per month. It can be noted that I have sufficient  savings  in
      my bank account which clearly demonstrates that I can accommodate  and
      maintain the [claimant] without further recourse to public funds".


  10.    He cited in support the cases of Mahad(Ethiopia) v ECO [2009]  UKSC
      16 and  Jahanara Begum  and  Others  (Maintenance-savings)  Bangladesh
      [2011] UKUT 00246 (IAC) which he said showed that benefits such as  CB
      and CTC were to be disregarded.

   The applicable law


   A. Benefits legislation
  11. Section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum  Act  1999  sets  out  which
      benefits cannot be legally  claimed  by  people  who  are  subject  to
      immigration control.


  12. Child and Working Tax Credits were included in s.115 on 1  April  2003
      but were not added to the definition of public funds (see below) until
      15 March 2005.


B. Immigration provisions
  13. Paragraphs 6 of the Statement of Changes  in  the  Immigration  Rules,
      HC395 as amended defines public funds as follows:
         "public funds" means
         (a) housing under Part VI or VII of the Housing Act 1996 and  under
         Part II of the Housing Act 1985,  Part  I  or  II  of  the  Housing
         (Scotland) Act 1987, Part II  of  the  Housing  (Northern  Ireland)
         Order 1981 or Part II of the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1988;


         (b) attendance allowance,  severe  disablement  allowance,  carer's
         allowance and disability living allowance under  Part  III  of  the
         Social  Security  Contribution  and  Benefits  Act  1992;,   income
         support, council tax benefit and housing benefit under Part VII  of
         that Act; a social fund payment under Part VIII of that Act;  child
         benefit under  Part  IX  of  that  Act;  income  based  jobseeker's
         allowance under the Jobseekers Act 1995, income  related  allowance
         under Part 1 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007 (employment and support
         allowance) state pension credit under the State Pension Credit  Act
         2002; or child tax credit and working tax credit under  Part  1  of
         the Tax Credits Act 2002.
         (c) attendance allowance,  severe  disablement  allowance,  carer's
         allowance and disability living allowance under  Part  III  of  the
         Social Security Contribution and Benefits  (Northern  Ireland)  Act
         1992;, income support, council tax  benefit  and,  housing  benefit
         under Part VII of that Act; a social fund payment under  Part  VIII
         of that Act; child benefit under Part IX of that Act; income  based
         jobseeker's allowance under the Jobseekers (Northern Ireland) Order
         1995 or income related allowance under Part 1 of the Welfare Reform
         Act (Northern Ireland) 2007.
  14. Paras 6A-C of the Immigration Rules explain what the position is  when
      an applicant is not claiming public funds themselves but their sponsor
      relies on public funds. With effect from 21 December 2010 [this is the
      relevant set of Rules because the decision was made in this case on 30
      December 2010] the  relevant provisions read:
         "6A. For the purpose of these Rules, a person  (P)  is  not  to  be
         regarded as having (or potentially having) recourse to public funds
         merely because P is (or will be) reliant in whole  or  in  part  on
         public funds provided to P's sponsor unless, as  a  result  of  P's
         presence in the United  Kingdom,  the  sponsor  is  (or  would  be)
         entitled to increased or additional public funds (save  where  such
         entitlement to increased or additional public funds is by virtue of
         P and  the  sponsor's  joint  entitlement  to  benefits  under  the
         regulations referred to in paragraph 6B).
         6B. Subject to paragraph 6C, a person (P) shall not be regarded  as
         having recourse to public  funds  if  P  is  entitled  to  benefits
         specified under section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999
         by virtue of regulations made under sub-sections  (3)  and  (4)  of
         that section or section 42 of the Tax Credits Act 2002.

         6C. A person (P) making an  application  from  outside  the  United
         Kingdom will be regarded as having recourse to public funds where P
         relies upon the future entitlement to any public funds  that  would
         be payable to P or to P's sponsor as a result of  P's  presence  in
         the United Kingdom, (including those benefits to  which  P  or  the
         sponsor would be entitled as a result of P's presence in the United
         Kingdom under the regulations referred to in to paragraph 6B)".
  15. Complementing the Immigration Rules, there are Immigration Directorate
      Instructions (IDIs). I only have these in version 5,  19  August  2011
      but I am not aware that insofar as they cover benefit issues they were
      any different in December 2011. These reiterate:


         (i) that benefits that are not considered as public funds  include:
         contribution based  jobseeker's  allowance,  guardian's  allowance,
         incapacity benefit, contributory  related  employment  and  support
         allowance (ESA), maternity allowance, retirement pension, statutory
         maternity pay, widow's benefit and bereavement benefit.
         (ii) that a person subject to immigration control is not considered
         as accessing public funds if it is their partner who  is  receiving
         the funds that they are entitled to.
         (iii) that child and working tax credits  are  claimed  jointly  by
         couples. If only one member of a couple is subject  to  immigration
         control, then for tax credits  purposes,  neither  are  treated  as
         being subject to immigration control.
         (iv) that child benefit is a  tax-free,  regular  payment  made  to
         anyone bringing up a child or young person. It  is  paid  for  each
         child that qualifies and is not affected by income or  savings,  so
         most people bringing up a child can get it.
         (v)That Child Tax Credit (CTC)  is  a  means-tested  allowance  for
         parents and carers of children or young people  who  are  still  in
         full-time, non advanced education or approved  training.  A  person
         claiming this benefit does not have to be the child's parent to  be
         eligible but they must be the main  person  responsible  for  them.
         Child tax credit can be claimed jointly as a couple but  will  only
         be paid to one member of the couple.
         (vi) that Working Tax Credit is a payment to top us the earnings of
         low paid working people.
         (vi) it is further stated that if a sponsor  needs  to  claim  more
         public funds to support the applicant, [the  decision-maker]  under
         Guidance -Public funds - v5.0, Valid from 19 August 2011 must:


            "refuse the application. For  example,  if  the  sponsor  claims
            income-based jobseeker's allowance and this  would  increase  if
            their dependant was granted leave as their spouse. .."


       and that:


            "If the sponsor needs to claim more public funds to support the
            applicant but these are funds that the  sponsor  and  dependant
            would  be  jointly  entitled  to  you  must  not   refuse   the
            application. For example, if the increased funds fall under the
            tax credits regulations, such as Working or Child Tax  Credits,
            then you must not  regard  the  applicant  as  having  accessed
            public funds. "


Relevant case law

  16. KA and Others (Adequacy of Maintenance) Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT  00065
      establishes  that  it  is  appropriate  to  consider  savings  in  the
      calculation.  It has also been established in Mahad (Ethiopia)  v  ECO
      [2009] UKSC 16 the Supreme Court observed that the  Immigration  Rules
      are not to be construed with all  the  strictness  applicable  to  the
      construction  of  a  statute  or  statutory  instrument  but  sensibly
      according to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used.  They
      noted that other forms of  assistance  and  other  funds  besides  the
      provision of accommodation were accepted to be legitimately  available
      to the parties in satisfying the maintenance requirement, such as DLA,
      which the settled relative could use as he or  she  liked.  The  Court
      concluded that the natural meaning of the words  was  in  effect  that
      there was a  requirement  that  the  family  would  be  able  to  cope
      financially.


My assessment

  17. Having considered the evidence presently before me,  I  have  resolved
      that I am not in a position to decide the issue of maintenance  -  the
      only outstanding issue. It is not in dispute  that  the  baseline  for
      assessing adequacy of maintenance is income  support.  Nor  is  it  in
      dispute that  the  relevant  income  support  figure  for  the  couple
      involved in this appeal was �235.29 per week. However, there  are  two
      conflicting views that have been presented as to what this entails for
      this appeal. The ECO's view, as presented by Mr Bramble  is  that  the
      maintenance requirement was not met because the sponsor was  not  able
      to show that her earnings came up to the �235.29 level bearing in mind
      that some or all of the benefits she received constituted recourse  to
      pubic funds. The claimant's view is that although the sponsor only had
      earnings of �161.30 at the date of decision all three of the  benefits
      she received, albeit within the para 6  definition  of  public  funds,
      fell to be disregarded by operation of paras 6A-C of  the  Immigration
      Rules; the arrival of the claimant, it was submitted, would  not  have
      resulted in any "additional" recourse to public funds.


  18. Whilst if the claimant is correct and all three of  the  benefits  she
      received fell to be disregarded as public funds, there is insufficient
      evidence before me to establish that they should have been disregarded
      or if so, what were the precise figures involved.

  19. It is said that she received:


   �161.30 In earnings
   �107.66 in Child Tax Credit (CTC)/Working Tax Credit (WTC)
   � 34.37 in Child Benefit (CB)

  20. However, on the basis  of   information  to  hand  regarding  benefits
      (which may or may not be correct):


    a. whereas it would appear that CB and CTC are  unaffected  by  whether
       the family has one or  two  adults,  the  calculation  for  WTC  has
       distinct figures;


    b. the applicable CTC figure would appear  to have  been  only  �98.94,
       unless one of the couple was disabled;


    c. it is not entirely clear what the amount in rent  the  couple  would
       pay. It would seem that the figure of �200 was in  relation  to  the
       sponsor's previous accommodation. She says in  her  undated  witness
       statement that at the new accommodation that she pays �325  a  month
       [�81.23 per week?];

    d. it is not clear whether the sponsor's living  arrangements  amounted
       to a common  household;  the  sponsor's  undated  witness  statement
       describes it as  "shared  accommodation  with  Mr  Saful  Alam  [her
       husband's uncle]", with each paying half each of the utility bills.

    e. It is not sufficiently  clear  what  the  position  was  as  regards
       housing benefit/ council tax benefit. It  would  appear  that  as  a
       single adult the sponsor was or would have been entitled  to  a  25%
       discount on council tax. With  the arrival,  however,  of  a  second
       adult (which is the relevant scenario here) the actual  council  tax
       liability would be higher (by a third);


    f. the evidence in the file relating to the sponsor's savings refer  to
       a Barclays bank account showing figures  consistently  below  �6,000
       but it is not confirmed whether at the date of decision the  sponsor
       had any other savings. If she  did,  they  might  impact  on  income
       support levels;


    g. the above points illustrate perhaps that the task of  assessing  the
       relevant income support levels for  the  purposes  of  deciding  the
       adequacy of maintenance as at the date of decision is not  a  simple
       matter of reading off the figures for income support  for  a  couple
       (with  children)  and  that  the  Tribunal  needs  assistance   with
       establishing the complete range of relevant variables and figures.


  21. In order to reach a decision on the maintenance issue,  therefore,  it
      is necessary to hold a further hearing. The case will be  heard  by  a
      senior panel  that  will  include  an  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  of  the
      Administrative Appeals Chamber.


  22.  It  is  directed  that  in  accordance   with   Tribunal   directions
      accompanying the notice of hearing (which will follow shortly) prepare
      written submissions addressing  the  matters  identified  in  para  20
      above.

                                Judge of the Upper Tribunal
