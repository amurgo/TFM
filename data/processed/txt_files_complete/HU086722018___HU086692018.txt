Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Jesurum, instructed by Everest Law
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellants are Nepalese nationals who were born on 16  January  1990
   and 19 January 1989  respectively.   They  are  siblings.   They  appeal
   against a decision which was issued by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  14
   March 2019, dismissing their appeals against the respondent's refusal to
   grant entry clearance as the  dependent  adult  children  of  a  retired
   Gurkha serviceman.


2. The appellants were represented by  Mr  Jesurum  before  the  FtT.   The
   respondent was unrepresented.  The sponsor - who served in  the  Brigade
   of Gurkhas for nine years before  being  discharged  with  an  exemplary
   service record in 1970 - adopted his witness statement but was asked  no
   additional  questions  by  Mr  Jesurum  or  the  judge.   Having   heard
   submissions in amplification  of  Mr  Jesurum's  comprehensive  skeleton
   argument, the judge reserved her decision.

3. The judge's reserved decision is  carefully  structured  and  thoroughly
   reasoned.  She rehearsed the relevant background  and  the  respondent's
   decision at [1]-[3] and [4]-[9].  She summarised the evidence  given  by
   the  appellants  and  the  sponsor  at  [11]-[24].   She  set  out   the
   submissions made by Mr  Jesurum  at  [26]-[34]  before  turning  to  her
   findings at [34]-[54].  In those findings,  the  judge  concluded  that,
   although the appellants receive funds from the sponsor and live  in  the
   sponsor's home in Nepal, the relationship between them is not one  which
   reaches the irreducible minimum of what constitutes a  protected  family
   life under Article 8 ECHR.  Had  she  reached  the  stage  of  assessing
   proportionality, she would have allowed the  appeals  but  she  did  not
   reach that stage, and dismissed the appeals as a result of  her  finding
   as to the engagement of Article 8 ECHR.

4. Permission to appeal was sought on five grounds.  The first two  grounds
   concerned a finding which the judge had reached at [47], which was  that
   the first appellant had not been unemployed since leaving Malaysia.   It
   was submitted that this finding - which implicitly rejected the evidence
   given by the appellants' father in his witness statement - was  vitiated
   by two legal errors, in that the  judge  had  failed  to  put  any  such
   concern to the sponsor and had failed to take his character into account
   before making the finding.

5. Grounds three to five concerned the judge's application of  the  law  to
   the facts.  It was submitted that she had misapplied the  law  regarding
   the provision of financial support; failed to recall in  her  assessment
   of family life that the appellants lived in  the  sponsor's  house;  and
   failed to take other material matters into account in  determining  that
   Article 8 ECHR was not engaged in its family life aspect.

6. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Kelly  on  grounds
   three to five but refused on grounds one  and  two,  which  Judge  Kelly
   considered to be predicated on an erroneous belief that  the  judge  had
   made adverse findings of fact.

7. The appeal first came before the Upper Tribunal (Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
   Judge Hutchinson) on  4  June  2019.  Counsel  for  the  appellants  (Mr
   Wilford) applied orally and in a Speaking Note for permission  to  argue
   the first two grounds, on which permission to appeal had been refused by
   the FtT.  Judge Hutchinson granted permission on those grounds  and  the
   appeal was adjourned to enable the respondent to consider  his  position
   in relation to those grounds.

8. So it was that the appeal came before me on 17 July  2019.   Mr  Jesurum
   made submissions on each of his grounds of appeal.   Having  heard  from
   him, I expressed my concern to  Ms  Everett  about  the  safety  of  the
   finding which had been made at [47] of the judge's decision, in relation
   to the first appellant having been unemployed since leaving Malaysia.  I
   was concerned that this rejection of the  sponsor's  evidence  had  been
   reached without notice.  Ms Everett initially submitted that  a  related
   point had been taken in the respondent's decision.  She  also  initially
   suggested that any such error  would  not  have  been  material  to  the
   disposal of the appeal.  On being pressed, however, Ms Everett  accepted
   that the judge had erred in reaching this finding without  alerting  the
   sponsor to her concerns and that the error was material to  the  judge's
   decision as to whether family life existed or not.  With  characteristic
   fairness, Ms Everett accepted that the decision could not stand in these
   circumstances.

9. I invited the advocates to address me on  the  appropriate  relief.   Mr
   Jesurum submitted that  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  able  to  remake  the
   decision without any further hearing.  Ms Everett submitted  that  there
   was no dispute as to the facts and that it would be disingenuous for the
   respondent to seek a further oral hearing when he had been unrepresented
   before the FtT.  She was content for the decision to be  remade  on  the
   papers.  I indicated that I would do so, and that  my  decision  on  the
   remaking of the appeal was reserved.


Analysis
10. Since Ms Everett accepted that the First-tier Tribunal judge had  fallen
   into error in her decision, I can express my reasons for  agreeing  with
   that concession comparatively  briefly.   In  order  to  do  so,  it  is
   necessary to consider the applicable law and the decision  under  appeal
   in a little more detail.


11. There is a substantial body of authority  on  the  'historic  injustice'
   suffered by the Brigade of Gurkhas and the consideration of applications
   such as those made by the appellants.  The judge was  plainly  aware  of
   those authorities and set out an impressive summary  at  [27]-[33].   In
   relation to the assessment of proportionality, the law  remains  as  set
   out in Ghising (No 2) [2013] UKUT 567 (IAC):

         "(4) where it is found that Article 8 is engaged and, but  for  the
         historic wrong, the Appellant would have been  settled  in  the  UK
         long ago, this will ordinarily determine the outcome of the Article
         8 proportionality assessment in an Appellant's  favour,  where  the
         matters relied on  by  the  Secretary  of  State/  entry  clearance
         officer consist solely of the public interest in maintaining a firm
         immigration policy."

12. In relation to the assessment of whether there is a family life  between
   adult relatives, the test remains whether there  are  more  than  normal
   emotional ties but in Jitendra Rai [2017] EWCA Civ  320,  the  Court  of
   Appeal highlighted that Sedley LJ had said in Kugathas [2003]  INLR  170
   that real committed or effective support "represents ... the irreducible
   minimum of what family life implies".


13. With the latter dictum firmly in  mind,  the  judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal embarked on her findings of fact.  She accepted  at  [39]  that
   the appellants live in the  sponsor's  home  in  Nepal.   At  [40],  she
   considered the funds which have been remitted  by  the  sponsor  to  the
   appellants, comprising 37 payments between 22 March 2015 and 9  February
   2019.  It was the sponsor's evidence that there had been more  but  that
   he had not saved the remittance slips.  At [42], the judge considered it
   'inexplicable' that he had not done so, in circumstances in which he had
   been hoping to bring the appellants to the United  Kingdom  since  2015.
   At [43], she also noted that there was 'no excuse at all' for  the  lack
   of further documentary evidence of remittances from April 2017 (when the
   applications for entry clearance were prepared).  She therefore  reached
   the following finding at [44] (reproduced verbatim):


         "Accoringly, I dod not accept that the appellant's  had  discharged
         he burden of showing committed financial support from the  sponsor.
         There is some support but it is intermittent."

14. At [45], the judge expressed concern about the ability  of  the  sponsor
   to remit funds to the appellants when he himself was  in  receipt  of  a
   small pension.  At [47], she reached this conclusion (again,  reproduced
   verbatim):

         "Further and in any event, the appellants are fit and well  and  of
         an age where she should be able to secure employment, even if it is
         in low paid manual work.  Dawa worked in Malaysia  for  significant
         periods between 2012 and 2015 and was  plainly  capable  of  fining
         work and supporting himself during that time.  I did not accept  on
         the b alance of probabilities that Dawa has been  unemployed  since
         leaving Malaysia and that he returned as he said  to  his  father's
         dependency."

15. The latter finding was plainly  of  the  greatest  significance  to  the
   judge's assessment of whether there was  real,  committed  or  effective
   support between the sponsor and the first appellant.   Having  concluded
   that the first appellant was not unemployed as claimed,  it  was  hardly
   surprising that the judge concluded that Article 8 ECHR was not  engaged
   in its family life aspect notwithstanding her acceptance that some money
   had been sent to Nepal by the sponsor between 2015 and 2019.


16. The difficulty with the  findings  at  [41]-[47]  is  that  the  judge's
   concerns were not raised at the hearing.  I reach  the  conclusion  that
   the findings are vitiated by procedural impropriety  but  I  reach  that
   conclusion by a slightly different route to that employed by Mr Jesurum.
    He relies on Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R.67 (HL) and MS (Sri Lanka) [2012]
   EWCA Civ 1548 to submit that points which are not put to a  witness  are
   taken to be accepted by the respondent.   But  the  respondent  was  not
   represented at this hearing and I do not consider the same principles to
   apply to a judge.

17. The procedure to  be  adopted  by  a  judge  when  the  Home  Office  is
   unrepresented are to be found in the Surendran guidelines (MNM  *  [200]
   UKIAT  5,  as  modified   by   subsequent   authorities,   including   R
   (Maheshwaran) v SSHD [2002] EWCA Civ 173; [2004] Imm AR 176 and WN (DRC)
   [2004] UKIAT 213.  In the latter  decision,  in  a  departure  from  the
   guidance given in MNM, Ouseley J stated that it was not  necessary  that
   every point which concerned a judge needed to be put to an appellant but
   that the 'major points of concern are better put, especially if they are
   not obvious': [28].

18. The sponsor is a  man  of  good  character.   He  said  in  his  witness
   statement that he had been remitting money to the  appellants  regularly
   but that he had only retained some of the remittance slips. He stated in
   terms that the first appellant had been unemployed since he had returned
   from Malaysia in 2015.  If the judge was concerned that these assertions
   were untrue, whether because an application for entry clearance  was  in
   contemplation from 2015 or because the appellants were fit and well  and
   able to work,  those  concerns  were  not  obvious  and  should,  in  my
   judgment, have been  put  to  the  sponsor.   Whether  the  judge  asked
   questions of the sponsor herself  or  whether  (as  recommended  in  the
   Surendran guidelines) the judge alerted counsel to the  points  so  that
   they  could  have  been  covered  in  chief,  I  consider  that  it  was
   procedurally improper to take these points against the  sponsor  without
   giving him an opportunity to address the judge's concerns.

19. As I have recorded, Ms Everett accepted that the  judge's  approach  was
   erroneous.  Considering the significance of the finding to the  critical
   question of whether there was real, committed or effective support,  she
   also accepted that the judge's error was material to the outcome of  the
   appeal.  It follows that I set aside the decision of the FtT.

20. Having reached that conclusion at the hearing, Mr Jesurum invited me  to
   remake the decision on the appeal myself and to allow  it.   Ms  Everett
   was content for me to do so and did not seek to make any submissions  on
   the final disposal of the appeal.  She did not seek, in  particular,  to
   put the FtT's concerns to the sponsor.


21.  In  my  judgment,  the  unchallenged  facts  establish  that  there  is
   undoubtedly  a  protected  family  life  between  the  sponsor  and  the
   appellants.  I accept the submissions  made  in  Mr  Jesurum's  skeleton
   before the FtT in that  regard,  the  salient  parts  of  which  are  as
   follows.

22. Although the appellants attained their majority a number of  years  ago,
   and despite the first appellant having worked in Malaysia  between  2012
   and 2015, they receive real, committed or  effective  support  from  the
   sponsor  at  present.   The  appellants  live  in  the  sponsor's  home.
   Although they participate in collective subsistence  farming,  they  are
   otherwise entirely dependent upon the sponsor's financial  support  from
   the UK.  He remits in  the  region  of  �150-�200  per  month  to  them,
   although he did not keep all of the remittance slips because he had  not
   appreciated the need to do so.  The reasons for that dependency are not,
   as Mr Jesurum submitted before me, material.  What matters is that  such
   dependency exists.

23. The separation of  the  family  occurred  not  by  choice,  properly  so
   called, but because the sponsor was unable to bring  the  appellants  to
   the UK whilst the historic  injustice  against  the  Brigade  and  their
   family members was operating.  The sponsor, his wife and the  appellants
   are in very regular contact and the anxiety  of  separation  is  intense
   because the sponsor was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013  and  the
   appellants'  mother  suffers  from  high  blood  pressure  and   thyroid
   problems.  His illness prevented him from returning to Nepal until  2016
   but when he did return (with his wife), they stayed with the  appellants
   for three months.  The appellants and their mother are often  distressed
   when they speak as a result  of  the  sponsor's  ill  health  and  their
   ongoing separation.  The sponsor and  his  wife  do  what  they  can  to
   maintain the appellants' morale but the appellants' mother  loses  sleep
   due to her separation from her children.

24. In my judgment, therefore, the relationship between the sponsor and  his
   adult  children  displays  more  than  normal  emotional  ties  and   is
   characterised by real, committed or effective support.  It follows  that
   Article 8 ECHR is engaged in its family life aspect.

25. As I have recorded, the FtT concluded that the appeal  would  have  been
   allowed if it had reached a different conclusion on Article  8(1).   The
   respondent has not sought to submit that this conclusion  was  wrong  in
   law and I consider that stance  to  be  fully  in  accordance  with  the
   authorities I have mentioned above.  In the  circumstances,  the  appeal
   will be allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT was materially erroneous in law and  is  set  aside.
I remake the decision on the appeals and allow both  appeals  on  Article  8
ECHR grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
