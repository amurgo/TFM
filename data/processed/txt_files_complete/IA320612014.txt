               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                      CONSENT ORDER PURSUANT TO RULE 39

Pursuant to rule 39 (1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
2008, the parties consent to the disposal of the above appeal on the
following agreed basis.

 1. That with the Tribunal's consent under rules 17 (2) the Respondent (the
    Secretary of State) withdraws his case that the First-tier Tribunal had
    not erred in law. It is accepted, following Banger [2018] EUECJ C-89/17
    that the appellant was properly entitled to an extensive examination on
    application.

 2. Accordingly, the parties agreed that the First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    should be set aside and the appeal summarily allowed.

 3. The Respondent is to issue the appellant with a residence card.

 4. Accordingly,  with  my  consent,  and  pursuant  to  rule  39  (1)  the
    proceedings are disposed  of  and  the  appellant's  appeal  is  to  be
    recorded as allowed.


Signed:                                      Dated:   8 February 2019
