Representation:

For the Appellant/Secretary of State for the Home Department:  Mr N
                                                     Bramble, Home Office
                                                     Presenting Officer
For the Claimant/Respondent:    Mr M Islam, London Law Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The claimant (whom I shall refer to as the appellant as he  was  before
    the First-tier  Tribunal  (hereinafter  "the  FtT")  is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh and his date of birth is 6 January 1982.

2.   On 4 February 2013 the appellant made an application to vary his  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.   His  application  was
    refused by the Secretary of State in a decision of 15 March 2013.   The
    reasons for the refusal can be summarised:

         "The appellant must establish that he has access to  �50,000.   The
         letter from the appellant's accountant states  that  the  appellant
         and his team member Khalid Hussain have a  shareholding  of  25,000
         ordinary shares each (valued at �1).  The unaudited accounts do not
         demonstrate the value of the shares or  the  date  of  purchase  or
         demonstrate the split between the  appellant  and  Khalid  Hussain.
         There were no share certificates.  The bank letters  from  Barclays
         do not bear the appellant's name or business  account  and  do  not
         demonstrate business activity.   The  appellant  has  not  provided
         sufficient evidence that he was registered as a director of  a  new
         business in accordance with the requirements of  Appendix  A  Table
         4(d)(iii).  The appellant must provide specified evidence namely  a
         current appointment report as specified in  Rule  41-SD(c)(iii)(f).
         In addition the  appellant  has  not  satisfied  Appendix  A  Table
         4(d)(iv) because he has not submitted evidence in  accordance  with
         41-SD(c)(iii) in relation to advertising and marketing materials."

3.   The appellant appealed and his appeal was allowed by Judge of  the  FtT
    Cohen following an oral hearing on 7  February  2014.   The  respondent
    applied for permission to appeal and this was granted by Judge  of  the
    FtT Cruthers on 8 April 2014.  Thus the matter came before me.

The Grounds Seeking Permission to Appeal and Oral Submissions

4.   The grounds seeking permission to appeal argue  that  the  decision  of
    the FtT was unreasoned.  In oral submissions Mr Bramble submitted  that
    the position of the Secretary of  State  was  that  the  FtT  erred  in
    failing to give adequate reasons; however, the error is  not  material.
    Mr Bramble made a concession that in his view the  appeal  should  have
    been allowed under the Rules and the error was not  material.  However,
    he was not in a position to apply to withdraw the matter because in his
    view the Judge had erred because of the failure to give reasons.

5.    Mr  Bramble  relied  on  the  application,  refusal   and   subsequent
    determination relating the  appellant's  business  partner,  Mr  Khalid
    Hussain.  His application was identical to that  of  the  appellant  in
    these proceedings and had been refused by the Secretary  of  State  for
    the same reasons. His appeal had subsequently  been  allowed  by  Judge
    Dell Fabbro in a decision that was  promulgated  on  18  October  2013.
    Judge Dell Fabbro found that Mr  Hussain's  appeal  should  be  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules.  The factual matrix was identical to  that
    of the appellant in these  proceedings.   Judge  Del  Fabbro  found  as
    follows:


           On the evidence before me I find that the appellant  did  submit
           specified documents purporting to comply with  the  requirements
           of the Rules.  Taking a  necessary  overview  of  the  documents
           actually submitted I find that several of  those  documents  did
           comply with the criteria.  Those that did not comply I find were
           in the wrong format.  As such the  respondent  was  required  to
           request the correct documentation in accordance  with  paragraph
           245AA(b).  The failure to do so renders this refusal as  not  in
           accordance  with  the  law.   Moreover,  I  do  find  that   the
           respondent  failed  to  apply  its  own  policy  on   evidential
           flexibility.  Paragraph 21.  It was common ground before me that
           the appellant met  all  the  other  criteria.   The  sole  issue
           related to the submission of documentary evidence in  accordance
           with the provision (d) requirements in  relation  to  access  to
           funds and evidence of being involved in a genuine  business.   I
           find that the appellant had submitted the required  evidence  in
           relation to his shareholding in the company  by  virtue  of  the
           accountant's  letter  and  the  share  value  of  the  published
           account.  The bank letter did refer to a  business  account  and
           was addressed to the appellant in  his  connection  with  Throne
           Engineering  Limited.   Evidence  of   HMRC   registration   was
           contained in a letter to that  effect  from  HMRC.   I  am  also
           satisfied that the advertising document recorded the appellant's
           name sufficiently to associate him with the business.  In  these
           regards I find that the appellant had  satisfied  the  necessary
           criteria."

6.       Mr Bramble referred me  to  the  archived  Immigration  Rules,  the
    archived points-based system - evidential  flexibility  guidance  which
    was valid from 12 March 2013.  In addition he referred me to a document
    entitled  "evidential  flexibility  -  documents  which   it   may   be
    appropriate to request for each tier with specific reference to Tier  1
    Entrepreneur."  In Mr Bramble's view it was so obvious and  clear  that
    as a result of the evidence submitted  by  Mr  Hussain  that,  had  the
    guidance been applied by the decision maker,  he  would  have  met  the
    requirements of the Rules, that it was  open  to  the  Judge  in  those
    proceedings to allow the appeal under the Rules. In his view  the  same
    should apply to this appellant.

Conclusions

7.   The Judge  Cohen's  reasons  are  not  clear  from  the  determination;
    however, I accept  Mr  Bramble's  concession  that  the  error  is  not
    material.  There were three shortcomings in the appellant's application
    that were identified in the Reasons for Refusal Letter and I accept  Mr
    Bramble's view that the decision maker should have exercised evidential
    flexibility  in  the  appellant's  favour  having  considered  the  PBS
    evidential flexibility and the  documentation submitted. It is of  some
    significance that Mr Hussain's appeal  was  allowed  and  he  submitted
    exactly the same documentation as  the  appellant  and  the  cases  are
    identical.  Mr Bramble's view was that it was open to the  Judge  Cohen
    in this appellant's case to allow the appeal on the basis that  it  was
    in accordance with the Rules.

8.   The Judge of the FtT made an  error  of  law  but  that  error  is  not
    material and the decision to allow the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules stands.
