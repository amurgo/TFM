                  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr V Sharma, of Matthew Cohen & Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of the United States  of  America.   He  is
    married to a national of  the  Netherlands  who  is  exercising  treaty
    rights in United Kingdom.  Having arrived  in  United  Kingdom  as  her
    spouse, on 15 February 2012 he made  an  application  for  a  residence
    card.  In his application he noted that he had  been  convicted  of  an
    offence in the United States of America.  Following investigations,  on
    10 May 2013 the Secretary of State notified the appellant of a decision
    to make a deportation order against  him.   He  appealed  against  that
    decision to the First-tier Tribunal.  Following a hearing  on  23  July
    2013, Judge Quigley and Dr C J  Winstanley  (the  panel)  issued  their
    determination dismissing his appeal.   He now appeals, with permission,
    to this Tribunal.

 2. Although the decision is a deportation decision, it  is  common  ground
    between the parties that the relevant considerations to be  applied  to
    the appellant's  circumstances  and  his  history  are  those  in  Regs
    19(1)(3)(b) and 21(1)-(6) of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003).

 3. The most important feature of this case is undoubtedly the  appellant's
    criminal history, and in order  to  understand  the  procedural  issues
    which we will have to deal with, it is important that we set  out  that
    history at this point.  The offence to which reference was made in  the
    application was committed on 7 June  2003.   It  is  described  by  the
    appellant in a letter to the Secretary of State dated 13 February  2012
    as follows:

          "Nine years ago, while on a business trip, I was detained  pending
          criminal charges, after  having  been  sexually  involved  with  a
          female minor in San Francisco.  Because both of us were under  the
          influence of alcohol, and also due to the fact that she was not of
          legal age (18 in California), I had no alternative  but  to  plead
          guilty and to serve a custodial sentence.  Because the offence was
          categorised as non-violent, however, the  actual  amount  of  time
          served was cut in half."

 4. In an annex to section 9.3 of the application form, the appellant  gave
    further details:

          "On a business trip to San Francisco, California, USA, on  7  June
          2003, my ex-wife dropped off my daughter, who was 15 �  years  old
          at the time, to my  hotel  room.   I  very  stupidly  and  wrongly
          acceded to my daughter's request to purchase  a  large  amount  of
          alcohol which we both consumed over the course of the evening.  We
          slept together and had sexual contact.   I  was  arrested  by  the
          police the next evening. "

 5. The sentence was eight years imprisonment, against which there  was  an
    allowance of about two and a half  years,  including  credit  for  days
    spent on remand, and half  the  sentence  had  to  be  served:  it  was
    followed by a lengthy period of parole.  The official record of  parole
    summarises the offence as follows:


          "Subject was visiting his 15 year old daughter while on a business
          trip from England.  While  at  a  SF  Hotel,  subject  got  victim
          intoxicated and proceeded to have sexual intercourse  with  victim
          despite her protest."

 6. We do not need to take any notice of a driving offence, which was  also
    declared by the  appellant.   There  was  another  offence,  which  is,
    however, of some importance.  It appears to have been introduced to the
    case by the appellant's grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    which include the following passage:

          "The appellant has no criminal history except the offence in issue
          committed under  the  influence  of  alcohol  and  a  misdemeanour
          offence committed in  1988  for  which  he  was  sentenced  to  do
          communal service for no more than 30 days, and had spent  no  time
          in prison.  The misdemeanour offence committed in  1988  has  been
          expunged and has not been considered by the Secretary of State for
          the appellant's deportation."

 7. The content of that paragraph was slightly changed in  the  version  of
    the grounds produced to support Mr Sharma's submission at  the  hearing
    of the appeal: the  phrase  relating  to  the  sentence  by  then  read
    "sentenced to attend jail for no more than thirty days, the time  being
    served on weekends, and had spent no time in prison".  At  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant was cross-examined by the
    Presenting Officer.  He was asked how many offences he had been charged
    with in USA, and in his reply he referred to the felony in  2005  (that
    was the date of the charge) and to a  misdemeanour  in  1990  which  he
    described as "considered spent".  He was then  asked  what  the  actual
    charge was, and Mr Sharma on his behalf objected on the ground that the
    conviction was spent and so irrelevant.   The  Presenting  Officer  was
    allowed to proceed and in answer to his questions  the  appellant  said
    that the charge was of sexual battery, the victim was his  11-year  old
    step-daughter.  The sentence was 30 days in  the  County  Jail,  to  be
    served at weekends.  The offence was charged as a misdemeanour.

 8. Having set out the facts to that extent,  we  can  turn  to  the  three
    procedural issues.

 9. The first arose immediately before  the  hearing.   The  appellant  had
    applied in writing for an anonymity order covering  proceedings  before
    the Upper Tribunal.  He made submissions to support his application  in
    person, although, so far as we are aware, his representation by Matthew
    Cohen  and  Associates  continued.   The  written   grounds   for   the
    application were as follows:

          "I require an order of anonymity due to  the  extremely  sensitive
          nature of the  evidence  included  in  the  appeal.   Should  this
          information be made available to the public, I would be at risk of
          harm, and my life itself would be at risk.


          Furthermore, if such information were to be made public record, my
          wife and family would be at risk of harm.


          The information included in the appeal is highly confidential  and
          should not appear in the public record."

10. It is fair to say that the appellant's oral submissions merely repeated
    those points.  We refused his application.  The reasons are as follows.
     The principle is that the administration of justice is public.  A good
    reason would have to be shown for granting anonymity to the  appellant.
    The appellant is a person whose history is that which we have set  out.
     His wife is the other person principally associated with his  argument
    that despite that history he should be allowed to reside  with  her  in
    the United Kingdom.  No minors are involved:  the  children  of  either
    the appellant or his wife are now over eighteen.   The  hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal was conducted in public.  We have no reason  to
    suppose  that  the  appellant's  history  is  not  publicly  available.
    Further, the appellant's application appears to contrast rather sharply
    with the part of his claim in which  he  asserts  that  he  makes  full
    disclosure of his history, which he is now putting behind him following
    his religious  conversion.   There  is  no  evidence  of  any  risk  of
    activities against him or any member of his family.   In  our  judgment
    there is in this case no good  reason  why  our  consideration  of  the
    appellant's appeal, and of the fact that it is the appellant's  appeal,
    should be removed from public view.

11. The second procedural point related to the  admission  of  an  item  of
    evidence.  On behalf of the Home Office, Mr Mullen sought permission to
    adduce the record that, following  an  Interim  Notification  Order,  a
    Notification Order had on 13 June 2013 been  made  in  respect  of  the
    appellant at Aberdeen Sherriff Court.  It makes the  appellant  subject
    to the notification records of Part II of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.
     It indicates that  in  addition,  following  risk  assessment,  he  is
    regarded as posing a "Medium" risk of  sexual  recidivism.   Mr  Sharma
    objected to the introduction of that evidence.  We reminded  Mr  Sharma
    that the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal was on  23  July  2013,
    and asked him why he had not adduced it then, as it was in existence as
    a Court Order, having more than a little bearing on the  submission  he
    made, that the appellant posed no risk to the community of  the  United
    Kingdom.   He told us that although he knew of the proceedings, he  had
    not seen the order.  It appears to us that that is  an  extremely  poor
    excuse.  Mr Sharma should, at the very least, have  secured  the  order
    and drawn it to the attention of the Presenting Officer.  Failure to do
    that runs the risk of being seen  to  mislead  the  Tribunal.   In  any
    event, we see no good reason why we should not admit it into  evidence,
    if it should be relevant.

12. The third  procedural  point  relates  to  the  admission  of  evidence
    relating to the misdemeanour charge.  In his submissions before us,  Mr
    Sharma simply asserted that, although  a  foreign  conviction,  it  was
    spent and inadmissible.  He referred us to no statutory provisions, and
    to no authorities.  As  we  have  indicated,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    allowed questions  relating  to  that  conviction  to  be  put  to  the
    appellant, and, as will become clear, the panel took the  answers  into
    consideration in making their decision.   Although,  as  we  have  also
    indicated, there was an objection raised by Mr Sharma  at  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal, there is again  no  indication  to  any
    reference to the actual content of the relevant law.

13. The position is as follows.  The Rehabilitation of Offenders  Act  1974
    does cover convictions by courts outside Great Britain: see s  1(4)  of
    that Act.  Whether the  sentence  is  properly  to  be  regarded  as  a
    community  sentence,  or  whether  it  was  in  fact   some   form   of
    imprisonment, there can be no  doubt  that,  under  the  terms  of  the
    Rehabilitation of  Offenders  Act,  the  conviction  is  "spent".   The
    consequence is, in general, that set out in s 4: the appellant is to be
    treated for all purposes in law as though  he  had  not  committed  the
    offence, and no evidence of the  offence  is  admissible.   There  are,
    however, important exceptions to that rule, set out in s  7,  of  which
    sub-sections (2) and (3) so far as relevant read as follows  (there  is
    no difference in these provisions as applicable in England and Wales on
    the one hand and Scotland on the other):


          "7(2) Nothing in section 4(1) above shall affect the determination
          of any issue, or prevent  the  admission  or  requirement  of  any
          evidence, relating  to  a  person's  previous  convictions  or  to
          circumstances ancillary thereto -
          ...


             (f)  in any proceedings in which he is a party  or  a  witness,
               provided that,  on  the  occasion  when  the  issue  or  the
               admission  or  requirement  of  the  evidence  falls  to  be
               determined, he consents to the determination  of  the  issue
               or, as the case may be, the admission or requirement of  the
               evidence notwithstanding the provisions of section (4)(1)
             ...


          (3) If at any stage in any proceedings before a judicial authority
             in Great Britain (not being proceedings to which, by virtue  of
             any of paragraphs (a) to (e) of sub-section (2) above or of any
             order for the time being in force under  subsection  (4)  below
             [there has been none] section (4)(1) above has no  application,
             or proceedings to which section 8  below  [defamation  actions]
             applies) the authority  is  satisfied,  in  the  light  of  any
             considerations which appear to work to be  relevant  (including
             evidence which has been or may thereafter be  put  before  it),
             that justice cannot be done in the case except by admitting  or
             requiring evidence relating to a person's spent convictions  or
             to circumstances ancillary thereto, that  authority  may  admit
             or, as the case  may  be,  require  the  evidence  in  question
             notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of  section  4
             above, and may  determine  any  issue  to  which  the  evidence
             relates  in  disregard,  so  far   as   necessary,   of   those
             provisions."

14. We have set out section 7(2)(f) in order to  exclude  it,  although  it
    might at first sight appear to be engaged by the facts of  the  present
    case.  The first mention of the misdemeanour appears to have been  made
    by the appellant  himself,  and  in  those  circumstances  he  must  be
    regarded as having consented to the matter being in  the  knowledge  of
    the Tribunal.  It is clear, however, that at the hearing, which was the
    occasion for the determination of the issue for the requirement of  the
    evidence, he objected to the questions  about  that  conviction,  which
    then proceeded by direction of the Tribunal.  Accordingly, whatever the
    history of the raising of the matter, subsection  (2)(f)  can  have  no
    application to the proceedings in the present case.

15. We turn then to subsection (3), and it is of course  at  once  apparent
    that the panel's determination contains no  reference  at  all  to  any
    consideration of the issues raised by that subsection or  any  decision
    to exercise the discretion there set  out.   No  doubt  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, as a judicial authority, should have been aware of the  terms
    of the Act: but it is also right to say that it was being invoked by  a
    solicitor who did not  draw  the  panel's  attention  to  any  relevant
    provisions of the Act.  Section 7(3) of the 1974 Act was the subject of
    the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal's determination in AA v SSHD [2008]
    UKAIT 00027.  The Tribunal's  consideration  and  conclusions  in  that
    appeal were as follows:

             "[9]  So far as the present appeal is concerned, it was for the
                 Home Office to satisfy the judge  that  she  could  not  do
                 justice without admitting the appellant's spent conviction.
                  They did not attempt this task, or even draw her attention
                 to the statutory provision which made  it  necessary.   The
                 use of 'require' as well as 'admit'  suggests  that  it  is
                 quite open to a judge to consider the interests of  justice
                 for herself in this connection.  Again she did not  do  so;
                 and to rely on the spent conviction as  she  did,  but  not
                 consider whether justice could be done without it,  was  in
                 our view an error  of  law.   Since  no  other  substantial
                 reason has been put forward for the appellant's  not  being
                 entitled to indefinite leave to remain as a long  resident,
                 it  was  clearly  a   material   error   of   law,   unless
                 consideration of the interests of justice would  have  been
                 bound  to  result  in  evidence  of  the  conviction  being
                 admitted.


             [10]   It follows that we  need  to  consider  whether  justice
                 could not be done in this case without  admitting  evidence
                 of this appellant's ten-year-old conviction and sentence of
                 3 months' imprisonment for trying to leave this country  on
                 a false Belgian passport, on  which  the  Home  Office  had
                 taken no action at the time, nor made any attempt to secure
                 his removal following it for 10 � years after.  In our view
                 it is enough to put the question in those terms,  not  only
                 to see that it was  by  no  means  bound  to  lead  to  the
                 admission of  the  evidence,  but  to  answer  it  in  this
                 appellant's favour.  Other sets of facts may well  lead  to
                 different decisions in cases of this kind on the  operation
                 of s.7(3); but in this case the result is that  the  appeal
                 must be allowed."

16. In the present appeal, for reasons we have already indicated, we  heard
    no submissions on  section  7(3)  and  its  meaning,  or  on  AA.   The
    difference in the facts between that case and the present appeal  does,
    however, give an opportunity to express  some  reservations  about  the
    conclusions expressed in such an absolute way in AA.  First, it may not
    be right to use wording which suggests duty on one party or the  other,
    and the word "prove" in the head note to AA would appear to be  clearly
    inapposite.  The position, as it appears to us, is simply that a  judge
    needs to consider whether, on all the material available, including the
    issues that arise in appeal and the parties' positions on them,  it  is
    necessary, in order to  do  justice,  to  admit  evidence  of  a  spent
    conviction.  That final phrase draws  attention  to  another  point:  a
    separate  decision  ought  to  be  made  in  relation  to  each   spent
    conviction, if there is more than one.  Thirdly, failure to go  through
    the process envisaged by section 7(3)  before  admitting  evidence  for
    spent convictions is clearly an error of law, but where the  facts  are
    different from those in AA it may be that the error  is  not  shown  to
    have had any effect in the outcome of the appeal.

17. In the present case it is clear that the panel admitted evidence of the
    spent conviction without either observing the general rule  imposed  by
    section 4 or considering whether to exercise the  discretion  conferred
    by section 7(3).  That was an error of law.   The  circumstances  were,
    however,  as  follows.    First,  the  existence  of  the  misdemeanour
    conviction was drawn to the attention of the Tribunal by the  appellant
    himself in grounds of appeal (not evidence) and no further  details  of
    it were given save that it ought  not  be  taken  into  account.   That
    process was sufficient to raise a suspicion which it might be difficult
    to dispel other than by knowing what the conviction was for.  Secondly,
    it was a specific feature of the submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant that the interval of time since the 2005 conviction, with  no
    subsequent offences, showed that the appellant was unlikely  to  offend
    again: but the interval between the two earlier convictions was  longer
    than the period since 2005.  It  was  therefore  impossible  justly  to
    appreciate what force the argument  advanced  on  the  appellant  might
    have, without access to his full history.  Thirdly,  the  full  history
    demonstrates an escalation of offending and,  again,  in  order  to  do
    justice to the case as a whole, it was necessary to know that.

18. For these reasons we regard it as wholly  inconceivable  that,  if  the
    panel had been aware of the provisions of the 1974 Act, they would  not
    have admitted evidence of the misdemeanour offence, whatever might have
    been said to them by or on behalf of the parties.  To  put  it  another
    way, the evidence was bound to be admitted.  Further, for the avoidance
    of doubt, we should say that if we were to have to remake the  decision
    we would certainly admit evidence of that conviction, for  the  reasons
    we have given.  The error of law made  by  the  panel  in  not  working
    through the process under the 1974 Act made no real difference  to  the
    way in which they dealt with the appeal.

19. We must now turn to the substance of the case.  After setting  out  the
    principles upon which the appeal had to be decided, the panel turned to
    the evidence.  They noted that the appellant's letter accompanying  his
    application form had, after the paragraph referring to  sexual  contact
    with a minor, to which we have set out above, listed  various  factors,
    including his work experience, which in his view made  his  application
    worthy of approval.  The panel's comment is "the tenor of the letter is
    largely  self-aggrandising".   They  went  on  to  comment   that   the
    description of the 2003 offence in that letter appears to downplay  the
    severity of the crime, although the actual details are set out  in  the
    comment on the application form from which we have also  quoted  above.
    At [31] the panel recorded their reactions to this.  First, the  letter
    to UKBA accompanying the application form  "omitted  certain  extremely
    important matters".  Secondly,  the  more  detailed  statement  of  the
    offence shows that the appellant's 15 �  year  old  daughter  had  been
    dropped off at the appellant's hotel room by her mother  and  "clearly,
    the appellant was in a position of trust".   Thirdly,  the  appellant's
    statement of the offence includes an implied blame of his daughter  for
    the purchase of the alcohol which they then both went  on  to  consume.
    The panel described that as "outrageous":

          "It is absolutely clear from the  above  paragraph,  which  is  of
          course the appellant's own account  of  what  happened,  that  the
          appellant took terrible advantage of his own daughter in a  manner
          which is very difficult for us to imagine the consequences for her
          in her  future  life.   Unfortunately  there  are  no  medical  or
          psychological reports before us in this respect"


20. The determination continues as follows:

          "[32] Turning back now to the context of the appellant's letter to
              the UK Border Agency  of  13  February  2012,  in  the  final
              paragraph, the appellant seeks to highlight his  remorse  and
              good character.  The paragraph is quoted below as follows:


                  'It is worth mentioning that my wife remained married  to
                  me and supported  me  both  financially  and  emotionally
                  throughout this ordeal.  I am deeply remorseful for  this
                  incident.  It was a result of a terrible mistake which  I
                  have worked hard  to  redress  through  professional  and
                  pastoral  counselling.   In  the  years  following   this
                  incident I have increasingly  turned  to  religion  as  a
                  source of comfort and guidance.  I have made  a  personal
                  and religious commitment to uphold high ethical and moral
                  standards,  and  have  taken  the  step  of  becoming   a
                  Jehovah's Witness.'

          [33] Again the tenor of this paragraph seems to us, once again, to
              be self-aggrandising.   There  is  a  total  absence  of  any
              reference to his daughter and any feelings of remorse towards
              her, only a reference to his turning to religion s  a  source
              of comfort and guidance  for  him.   There  is  reference  to
              upholding high ethical and moral standards and absolutely  no
              reference to the enormous depravity of his  crime.   We  find
              that this letter shows a complete lack of  self-awareness  on
              the part of this appellant.  We also find that this same lack
              of self-awareness permeated his oral evidence before us."

21. The panel then deals with the 1990 offence, and concludes  that  "there
    is clearly a definite pattern of offending".  There is  then  reference
    to  one  of  the  trigger  points  for  his  offending  being   viewing
    pornography, and the panel's conclusion, after considering the evidence
    before  it,  that  the  appellant  has  not  undertaken   any   focused
    rehabilitation course, but has instead decided that, so far  as  he  is
    concerned, the cure is his  religion.   In  paragraph  [39]  the  panel
    raised (very  properly  in  our  view)  a  concern  about  safeguarding
    practices in the church to which the appellant belongs, where there are
    a number of young teenagers.  The panel comment as follows:

              "We accept that there are various letters in the  documentary
              evidence testifying to the appellant's kindness,  assistance,
              involvement in his local community and church.   However,  it
              seems to us that the appellant is a clever  and  manipulative
              person who will seek to put forward the best presentation  of
              himself on every occasion."

22. Given the pattern of the appellant's offending, and the  fact  that  he
    had not undertaken any  appropriate  courses,  the  panel  reached  the
    conclusion that there was a real risk  that  he  would  commit  further
    offences of the same nature.

23. So far as the evidence of the appellant's wife is concerned, the  panel
    concluded that she had no real appreciation of  his  offending  or  the
    level of it: indeed it appeared that she knew little or nothing of  the
    1990 offence.   The panel looked at the evidence  of  the  family  life
    relating to the appellant, his wife and her son (now aged about thirty)
    and appeared to have concluded that the ties between them were  not  so
    strong as to prohibit the appellant's removal.  The appellant  and  his
    wife had, after all, lived apart - thousands of miles apart -  when  he
    was in prison and subsequently when the terms of his  parole  prevented
    him leaving the United States of America.  The panel concluded that "We
    have no hesitation  in  finding  that  the  personal  conduct  of  this
    appellant does represent a genuine presence  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society"  and
    concluded further that the appellant's removal was not disproportionate
    in all the circumstances of the case.  The panel accordingly  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.

24. The grounds of appeal are lengthy  and  rather  unfocused.   The  first
    ground is that the appellant's wife has been exercising  treaty  rights
    in the United Kingdom for the last fifteen  years  and  should  not  be
    expected to leave the country.  There is no suggestion, however, in the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision that the appellant's wife  should  leave
    the United Kingdom: on the contrary, the decision proceeds on the basis
    that if the appellant is deported they will not be living together.

25. The second ground is that the First-tier Tribunal was not  entitled  to
    hold that the appellant's description of himself was "self-aggrandising
    and remorseless".  In our judgment the panel were more than entitled to
    make the comments they did.  The ground continues by pointing out  that
    the details of the appellant's offence were contained in  the  comments
    in his application form.  That, however, is precisely  what  the  panel
    said.  They took into account what he had said about himself, but  also
    noted that when undertaking the task of "introducing"  himself  to  the
    Secretary of State in a covering letter,  he  downplayed  the  offence.
    That is absolutely accurate.  The same ground goes on to indicate  that
    "pleading guilty in itself indicates that the appellant is remorseful".
     That, however, is not what the appellant  said:  he  said  he  had  no
    choice but to plead guilty.  We reject ground 2.

26. Ground 3 sets out the facts of the relationship between  the  appellant
    and his wife, beginning in 1997 and interrupted from 2003 until the end
    of his parole.  The ground objects to the  Tribunal's  conclusion  that
    "their relationship was mere (sic) of a carer and a vulnerable person".
     The phrase in the determination at [45] is "the  relationship  between
    the appellant and his wife is more akin  to  that  of  a  carer  and  a
    vulnerable person".  That view was drawn from the evidence as a  whole,
    including  the  appellant's  response  to  what  cannot  have  been  an
    unexpected question about what would be lost from the  relationship  if
    the appellant and his wife lived  apart.   As  the  ground  says,  "the
    element of care does form a formidable part in a genuine relationship",
    but the appellant did not  appear  to  give  very  much  indication  of
    anything else that was in their relationship.  We reject ground 3.

27. Ground 4 is apparently  an  assertion  that  the  appellant  should  be
    regarded  as  a  person  who  has  undertaken  relevant  rehabilitation
    courses.  None were specified by the appellant in answer  to  questions
    at the hearing.  The ground relies entirely on supposition.   There  is
    nothing in it which gives any reason to say that  the  panel  were  not
    entitled  to  reach  the  conclusions  they  did  about  rehabilitation
    courses.  The point which the panel make, which the ground appears  not
    to appreciate, is that the appellant has shown  no  sign  of  accepting
    that he may need to be directed by others, rather than himself choosing
    what he considers would be  appropriate  for  his  rehabilitation.   We
    reject ground 4.

28. Ground 5 relates to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act  1974,  and  we
    have already dealt with it.

29. Ground 6 asserts that the appellant is fully rehabilitated, and that he
    would not have been released from parole if that had not been the case.
     The truth is that the appellant's parole was maintained for the  whole
    of the applicable period.  There is no reason to suppose  that  it  was
    possible to maintain parole beyond the date on which it was maintained:
    it is certainly clear that deliberate decisions were taken  during  the
    appellant's parole that it was not appropriate to  release  him  before
    the end date fixed for it.

30. Ground 7 invokes the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Essa  v  SSHD
    [2013] UKUT 00316 (IAC).  That ground appears to be  inconsistent  with
    the  previous  ground,  which  is   that   the   appellant   is   fully
    rehabilitated.  There is, in any event, no basis for saying either that
    the  appellant's  rehabilitation  is  continuing,  or   that   whatever
    activities the appellant is currently undertaking with his  church,  he
    cannot continue them in any other part of  the  world.  Ground  7  also
    contains a restatement of assertions made at the various stages in  the
    appellant's appeal.  It does not appear to contain  any  new  material.
    We reject Ground 7.

31. The position is that the First-tier Tribunal considered the evidence in
    full.  It recognised that it was dealing with an appellant  who  had  a
    very serious history, and who showed no signs of recognising either the
    harm he was doing to others or the need to make the sort of changes  in
    his life which he might not otherwise  choose.   He  has  a  long  term
    marriage to a Dutch national, but the evidence did not demonstrate that
    it would be disproportionate to require them to live apart, if that was
    the consequence of the appellant's deportation.  The comments  made  by
    the panel are, we think, all  comments  that  we  would  endorse.   The
    conclusion that he continues to represent a threat to the pubic by  the
    commission of further offences is endorsed by the  notification  order,
    which Mr Sharma was at such pains to attempt to prevent us from  taking
    into account.  Strictly speaking, it does not fall  to  be  taken  into
    account, because, apart from  the  error  in  dealing  with  the  spent
    conviction, which we have found made no difference, the panel  made  no
    error in its assessment of the appellant's appeal.

32. For the foregoing reason, this appeal is dismissed.
