Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr I Ali of Everest Law Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr G Jack, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal issued on 02  June  2014  allowing  the  claimant's
    appeal against the decision of 06 December 2013  refusing  him  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (general) student migrant. In this decision
    I will refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the claimant as the appellant and the Secretary of  State  as
    the respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born on 15 May 1986. On 13 February
    2011 he was granted leave to  enter  as  a  Tier  4  student  until  24
    December 2012 and on 06  November  2012  he  made  an  application  for
    further leave to remain. His application was refused on the basis  that
    the letter produced from NCC Bank confirming that he had been  given  a
    loan of 1,500,000 rupees  was  required  to  show  that  the  loan  was
    provided by the national government, the state regional government or a
    government sponsored student loan company or as part of an academic  or
    educational loan scheme. Judge Oakley found that the appellant was able
    to meet the requirements of the policy guidance in force at the date of
    decision and the appeal was allowed.

 3. The respondent sought permission to appeal on the basis that as  of  06
    December 2013 Appendix C of the Rules required at  para  1B(d)(7)  that
    the letter provided the information referred to above. When considering
    the application for permission to appeal Judge Brunnen said  that  this
    point was misconceived as the application was made on 06 December  2012
    and the amendments to Appendix C were introduced with  effect  from  28
    February 2013 by HC760 and at the preamble to  that  statement  it  was
    made clear that the change was not applicable to  an  application  made
    before but not decided by 28 February  2013.  However,  permission  was
    granted on the basis that the Judge arguably did not make  any  finding
    on whether the admissible evidence satisfied the version of  the  Rules
    applicable to the application.

 4. At the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Jack  conceded  that  the  appellant's
    application should have been decided under the provisions of the  Rules
    pre-dating the amendment introducing the requirement set  out  at  para
    1B(d)(7) and  that  Judge  Brunnen's  comments  in  this  respect  were
    correct. He did not seek to argue that there had been  any  failure  by
    the judge to make any essential findings of fact on the evidence before
    him  and  conceded  that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed.  In   these
    circumstances I did not need to hear from Mr Ali.  Mr  Jack  sought  to
    withdraw his case and I am satisfied that this is a  proper  course  to
    take and give consent under  Rule  17  (2).  The  effect  is  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal stands.

Decision

 5. The respondent has withdrawn her case. The decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stands.
