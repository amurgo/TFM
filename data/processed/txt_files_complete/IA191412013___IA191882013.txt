                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. In  a  determination  promulgated  on  7th  March  2014  First-tier
        Tribunal  Judge  Camp  allowed  the  appeals  of  this  father  and
        daughter,  born  on  31st  January  1964  and  20th  February  2002
        respectively, against the refusal of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
        issue them with a Residence Card as confirmation of their right  to
        reside in the United Kingdom as the spouse and daughter of  an  EEA
        national, a German citizen, exercising Treaty rights in the  United
        Kingdom.


     2. The Respondent asserts the Judge erred in allowing  the  appeal  on
        the basis of the available  evidence  which  it  is  submitted  was
        inadequate to establish that the EEA national was exercising Treaty
        rights in the United Kingdom.


     3. Permission to appeal was granted on 25th March 2014 and the  matter
        came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey on 6th June 2014  who
        adjourned the initial hearing as a  result  of  late  documentation
        having been received from the Appellant  which  Mr  Smart  for  the
        Respondent wished to corroborate with HMRC. There was no finding in
        relation to whether there was an error of law in the determination.



Background


     4. The first appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  24th  September
        2012. He states his wife and daughter were already in the  country,
        having arrived in May of the same year. His oral evidence was  that
        at that time they lived at 300  Grangemouth  Road,  Coventry.  When
        asked where his wife worked at that time the appellant was hesitant
        indicating he was not sure about the place although when asked what
        sort of place it was he stated it was a convenience store.


     5. The first appellant was not employed  at  that  time  although  has
        worked since, but claims to be currently  unemployed  now.  He  was
        asked whether when he came to the United Kingdom on 24th  September
        his wife lived in 300 Grangemouth Road, which  he  stated  was  the
        case. He was not sure how long she had lived there although  stated
        she arrived around 2nd September.


     6. The first appellant was referred to two  letters  of  10th  October
        2013 from Ponswood Convenience Store and Costcutter but  he  stated
        he had never been to that place. When asked how his  wife  obtained
        those letters he did not know the details but claims  to  know  she
        got them from there.   It was also his evidence that his  wife  had
        now started a new job and  provided  pay  slips  relating  to  that
        employment with Pizza Express which she started in June  2014.  She
        still worked at Costcutter in Coventry too.


     7. The evidence of the EEA national is that she  came  to  the  United
        Kingdom  in  May  2012  and  initially   lived   in   Hastings   in
        accommodation above a convenience store in that town.  She  stopped
        working at Ponswood in October 2012 and stated her husband  arrived
        in the United Kingdom in September 2012 although he has never lived
        with her in Hastings.


     8. The EEA national's evidence is that  she  worked  at  Ponswood  and
        provided a P45 showing an income of �2,553.60 from that  employment
        and a leaving date of 1st October  2012.  She  was  asked  about  a
        payslip provided in relation to her employment dated 30th September
        2012 which showed a gross income of �2,553.60, the figure appearing
        on the P45, but which appeared to be contradicted by a  second  pay
        slip dated 31st October 2012 recording 140 hours worked and a gross
        income figure of �3,420.20,  which  post-dated  the  date  the  EEA
        national   allegedly   terminated   her   employment   with    that
        organisation. The response was that the  accountant  gave  her  the
        evidence which she now has.  When asked  why  the  tax  authorities
        were told she had finished on 1st October 2012, whereas she was now
        asserting that she was paid to 31  October  2012,  she  alleged  an
        error had been made but that she could not  "get  a  reference  for
        that".


     9. The EEA national confirmed her husband came to the  United  Kingdom
        on 24th September 2012 and that at that  time  they  lived  at  300
        Grangemouth Road in Coventry. She  also,  however,  claimed  to  be
        going to her work in Brighton although when asked when she moved to
        the address in Coventry she was not able to recall.   When  it  was
        put to her that her husband had  stated  that  they  came  on  24th
        September 2012 and both lived at 300 Grangemouth Road she confirmed
        that her husband had joined her at her brother's house for two days
        after which they moved to  the  Coventry  address.  Notwithstanding
        this statement, she also confirmed that she  continued  working  at
        Ponswood until the end of October in  Hastings.   She  claimed  she
        returned to Coventry at the weekend.


    10. Two letters have been provided in support of the appeal  dated  2nd
        October 2013 in relation to which the EEA national claims  one  was
        collected by her by hand and the other was posted. She claims  they
        were written by "the Boss" but denied this was a reference  to  the
        same man. When asked  who  wrote  the  Costcutter  letter  the  EEA
        nationals response was that she told them what she wanted and  they
        wrote it. She did not know who typed the letter which she collected
        in Coventry. The letter from Ponswood was sent by  post  after  she
        spoke to them and requested the letter on the  telephone  and  when
        she was working there.  Her explanation for the fact  both  letters
        are dated 2 October 2013 is that she "requested  the  same  series"
        which she confirmed to mean that she provided the same  information
        to "both of them". It was pointed out the two letters  are  similar
        in the way they are laid out to which the EEA nationals  reply  was
        that as "they did not know how to draft the letters" she gave  them
        information with the help of an assistant from the Law Centre.


    11. The EEA national stated she did not know  if  the  authors  of  the
        letter used the same computer and was unable  to  explain  how  two
        letters, one purportedly from Hastings and one from  Coventry,  had
        the same typeface and spacing.


    12. The EEA national also referred to wage statements provided  at  the
        hearing which she stated related to further employment she obtained
        at Pizza Express in June  2014.  She  claims  she  still  works  at
        Costcutter in Coventry on a part-time basis of 24  hours  per  week
        too.


    13. The EEA national was asked whether her  bank  statements  reflected
        the cash she claimed she earned which she stated they did not.


    14. In reply to questions put in  cross-examination  the  EEA  national
        confirmed her evidence was that she  worked  at  Ponswood  until  1
        October 2012. When it was put to her that  her  P45  indicated  she
        stopped working there on 1 October 2012 she claimed  this  document
        was not wrong but claimed to have a letter of explanation dated 7th
        February 2014 which was handed in. When  it  was  put  to  the  EEA
        national that she had submitted an official document indicating the
        tax office were told she stopped work  on  1  October  2012  having
        learned �2252 which was contradicted by a wage slip indicating that
        she in fact ceased such employment on 31 October 2012, she  alleged
        it must have been made by the accountant and that she worked  until
        30th October 2012.


    15. The EEA national repeated her claim to have lived  in  Coventry  at
        the weekends only before returning to her work in  Hastings  during
        the week and claimed to support the family.


    16. Additional documentary evidence includes a scanned copy of a letter
        from Saha Accounting Services based in Harrow in Middlesex  stating
        they act for Ponswood Convenience Store for whom they prepared  the
        wage slips and who allegedly informed the accountant that  the  EEA
        national left their employment on 1 October 2012 after  which  they
        sent an amended payslip to the employer, and attach a copy to their
        letter.


    17. The letters dated 2 October 2013, one purportedly originating  from
        Ponswood Convenience Store in Hastings confirming the EEA  national
        worked as a shop assistant from 2 July 2012 to October  2012  on  a
        full-time basis  fails  to  specify  the  date  of  termination  of
        employment, and from Costcutter (Trew  Ltd)  in  Coventry  alleging
        employment from 2 December 2012 to the date of the letter on a part
        time basis, appear to be in identical format.


    18. There is in addition in the  appeal  bundle  a  number  of  related
        documents, a letter from the EEA national dated  25  November  2013
        stating she did not transfer wages into her bank account as she was
        paid in cash, copy wage slips from Ponswood Convenience  Store  for
        31st July 2012 to 31st October 2012, a letter from HMRC dated  18th
        July 2012 to the EEA national containing  a  Hastings  address  and
        containing  an  employer  registration  and  reference  numbers,  a
        Hastings Borough  Council  non-domestic  rate  demand  in  the  EEA
        nationals brothers name in relation to shop premises  in  Hastings,
        together with wage slips relating to employment with  Trew  Limited
        dated 31st October 2013 to 30th November 2013, and a number of bank
        statements showing varying amounts  being  credited  into  the  EEA
        nationals bank account.


    19. Following additional documents having been disclosed at the hearing
        on 6th June 2014 Mr Smart sought an adjournment to  enable  him  to
        undertake checks with HMRC which has resulted in the production  of
        a witness statement by a named  Revenue  Officer  dated  18th  July
        2014.  There is  also  an  earlier  statement  from  another  named
        officer of HMRC indicating that in relation  to  the  EEA  national
        they have an address  for  her  since  30th  October  2012  at  300
        Grangemouth Road in Coventry and previously from 18th July 2012  at
        103 Battle Road, St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex. The author of the
        report also states that HMRC computer records show PAYE  employment
        in the tax years 2013/12  at  Ponswood  Convenience  Store  and  an
        earned income of �2,553.60 with nil tax deducted.


    20. A statement dated 18th July 2014 from a different officer  of  HMRC
        records the address in Coventry and in  relation  to  the  employer
        details confirms the 2012/13  employment  at  Ponswood  Convenience
        Stores and also from 3rd December 2012 at Trew Ltd with a  declared
        income of �7,409.50 and for 2013/14 at Trew  Ltd  with  a  declared
        income of �8,107.92.  The Officer's report also records  that  Trew
        Ltd submitted form P35 on 15th May 2014 resulting in reconciliation
        as a result of an underpayment of PAYE to be collected in  2015/16.
        That document is exhibited to the statement.


    21. A third statement dated  7th  August  2014  produced  by  the  same
        Officer refers to a copy of form P14 for  the  tax  year  2012/2013
        submitted to HMRC by Ponswood Convenience Store  and  correcting  a
        typographical error in relation to the Trew Ltd income  figure  for
        2013/14 which should read �8,017.97.  The P 14  document  indicates
        employment by the EEA national at Ponswood Convenience Store from 1
        July 2012 to 1 October 2012 with a total income of �2,553.60.


    22. In relation to the 'error of law' element of  this  case,   I  find
        Judge Camp has materially erred in law as it was clear that all the
        Judge had available to him at that hearing  was  oral  submissions,
        including a statement by the first appellant  that  his  wife  only
        worked at Costcutter yet then claiming that she worked elsewhere at
        Costcutter, trading as Trew Ltd.   Before  the  Judge  the  P45  in
        relation to Ponswood refers to employment to  the  end  of  October
        2012 which was allegedly received in May 2013 some six months later
        and the absence of any other form  of  documentary  evidence.   The
        record  of  proceedings  notes  submissions  raised  the  lack   of
        evidence, a statement by an HMCR Officer and  inconsistencies  were
        highlighted, together  with  the  fact  the  employer  was  not  in
        attendance and the fact that false information had  been  presented
        to the court.  The determination fails to  deal  with  any  of  the
        conflicts in the evidence and appears to be decision  based  solely
        upon accepting the word of the witnesses who appeared  before  him.
        Whilst the weight to be given to the evidence may be a  matter  for
        the Judge it is not clear that evidence  was  considered  with  the
        required degree of anxious scrutiny or that adequate  reasons  have
        been given to support findings made. For this and the  reasons  set
        out in the  grounds  a  material  legal  error  is  found  and  the
        determination set aside.




Discussion



    23. In proceeding to remake  the  decision  I  note  the  Secretary  of
        State's position which is that the  evidence  regarding  employment
        remains inadequate and  contradictory.   The  documentary  evidence
        regarding the Ponswood employment to the  end  of  October  is  not
        confirmed by HMRC who also note an address of 300 Grangemouth  Road
        since 10th October 2012.


    24. In relation to the employment  with  Ponswood  and  Costcutter  two
        letters have been provided as evidence of employment in the  bundle
        and when reviewed it is submitted they should  have  little  weight
        placed upon them as proof of such employment, in isolation, for the
        reasons set out above. Mr Smart submitted it could be inferred that
        the employment is not genuine and that the  tax  office  have  been
        provided with the  details  they  have  recorded  as  a  result  of
        proceedings before the Tribunal, and accordingly is  evidence  that
        cannot be relied upon.


    25. The EEA national's evidence  is  that  on  arrival  in  the  United
        Kingdom she lived with her brother which one assumes to be  at  the
        address in Hastings until she moved to Coventry  with  her  husband
        and daughter.  The relationship between the members of this  family
        is not disputed and the issue is whether the above appellants  have
        established the right to be granted a Residence Card as recognition
        of their right to reside in the United Kingdom as family members of
        an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.


    26. EEA matters have to be determined on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
        available at the date of the hearing and, in this respect, the  EEA
        national relies upon three separate  periods  of  employment.   The
        first of which is with a store within the building where she  lived
        in  the  Hastings  (Ponswood).  I   find   there   are   evidential
        discrepancies in  relation  to  this  employment  and  the  letters
        provided in support at pages three and four of the bundle  need  to
        be approached with caution as a result of similarities and the  EEA
        nationals admission in evidence that she effectively  dictated  the
        terms of the contents of  the  letters  which  have  been  produced
        solely for the purposes of these proceedings.


    27. The major discrepancy relates to the claim by the EEA national that
        she remained working in Hastings at the time  her  husband  claimed
        she had moved to Coventry, which she tried to explain  by  alleging
        that she commuted on  a  weekly  basis  to  Hastings  returning  to
        Coventry at the weekends.  No further details were provided  and  I
        find that such a claim is implausible especially in  light  of  the
        information contained in the HMRC reports that from  early  October
        2010 the EEA nationals  address  was  given  as  that  in  Coventry
        indicating that at that time she informed HMRC that  she  had  left
        Hastings and lived in the West  Midlands.   The  witness  statement
        provided by HMRC supports employment with  that  employer  for  the
        period to 1st October 2012 for which  she  received  an  income  of
        �2,553.60.  This is supported by the P45 provided in the  evidence.
        That claim it is, however, undermined by the provision of a further
        wage slip alleging the EEA national remained employed  at  Ponswood
        after the date the official documentation  shows  she  ceased  such
        employment.  The letter from the accountant purportedly  supporting
        this does not adequately explain the discrepancy and I find greater
        weight may be  placed  upon  the  documents  produced  by  HMRC  in
        relation to this matter.


    28. The latest statements indicate that in addition to  the  employment
        at  Ponswood  Convenience  Store  the  EEA  national   subsequently
        obtained employment from 3 December 2012 with Trew  Ltd  with  whom
        she continues to be employed and who  have  returned  the  required
        documents to the tax authorities on her behalf.


    29. The third area of employment is stated to be  with  Pizza  Express,
        which is more recent employment for  which  wage  slips  have  been
        provided, as a cleaner and which refer to her personal details  and
        the address in Coventry.  It appears therefore that at the date  of
        the hearing the employment being relied upon  as  evidence  of  the
        exercise of Treaty rights is that with Trew Ltd and Pizza Express.


    30. Mr Smart was correct to refer to the  need  for  employment  to  be
        genuine and his assertion that as a  result  of  what  may  be  the
        production  of  false  documents  relating  to  the  employment  in
        Hastings  all  such  evidence  should  be  discounted  is   not   a
        sustainable argument.  The submission that the documents from  HMRC
        are based upon false details  or  inaccurate  information  provided
        solely for the purposes of these proceedings is  not  supported  by
        adequate evidence. The EEA national  lives  in  Coventry  with  her
        husband and child  and  having  moved  to  the  area  has  obtained
        employment in accordance with her rights as an  EEA  national.  The
        documents paint a plausible picture and there  is  no  evidence  of
        enquiries having been made with the benefit authorities to indicate
        dependency on public funds or elsewhere. I find on the basis of the
        material made available that at the date of  the  hearing  of  this
        appeal the appellants have discharged the burden of proof upon them
        to  the  required  standard  to  show  that  their   EEA   national
        wife/mother is undertaking genuine employment in the United Kingdom
        such as to show that she is exercising Treaty rights and that  they
        are entitled, as a result, to  the  issue  of  Residence  Cards  in
        recognition of their rights as family members of the EEA national.


    31. Mr Smart's assertion of forged/false employment is  not  proved  in
        relation to the evidence from Trew Ltd or Pizza Express.


Decision.

    32. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. These appeals are allowed.


   Anonymity.


    33. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson
Dated the 19th September 2014
