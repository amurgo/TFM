                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Parkinson, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Pease, Counsel, instructed by TKD Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    which challenges a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  Judges
    Harries and Mr Bremmer.

 2. The appellant, to whom I shall refer as Master T M in the light of  the
    anonymity direction that has already been made, was at the time  before
    the First-tier Tribunal hearing  17  years  old.   He  was  born  on  5
    September 1995 and is a national of Nigeria.

 3. He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  the
    respondent, which was made on 3 April 2013 to make a deportation  order
    against him under Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.

 4. The circumstances briefly were that the appellant arrived in the United
    Kingdom in May 2003 when he was aged 7ï¿½ with his  mother  and  brother.
    The  appellant  did  commit  a  number  of  criminal  offences  and  in
    particular, and most importantly, on 25 August 2011 he was convicted of
    two offences of possessing cocaine with intent to  supply.   The  court
    imposed a six month detention and training order  in  respect  of  that
    offence and that was to run concurrently with an 18 month detention and
    training order that was  imposed  for  violent  disorder.   Both  those
    offences, one involving the supply of a Class A drug,  and  the  second
    involving plainly from the length of sentence serious violent disorder,
    were serious offences.  Nonetheless, it was contended that in the light
    of the appellant's integration into the United Kingdom, the  time  that
    he had spent there, the ties that he had formed, his age and  the  lack
    of ties in Nigeria, he benefited from the Immigration Rules  that  deal
    specifically with the balance between the public interest in  deporting
    those who have committed serious crime  and  the  considerations  under
    Article 8 of both private and family life.

 5. The Tribunal, at paragraph 27, considered the appellant's circumstances
    and made a specific finding that he fell within  Rule  399A(b),  namely
    that he was a person under the age of 25 who had spent at least half of
    his  life  living  continuously  in  the  United  Kingdom   immediately
    preceding the date of the immigration decision, in this case of  course
    the deportation order, discounting any period of  imprisonment  and  he
    had no ties, including social, cultural or family with the  country  to
    which he would have to go if required to leave the United Kingdom.

 6. The Tribunal  carefully  considered  the  evidence  and  concluded,  at
    paragraph 29 of the determination, that the  appellant  fell  expressly
    within 399A(b) because he  did  not  have  the  ties  there  specified.
    Accordingly, the Tribunal reached the decision that allowed the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

 7. The Secretary of State nonetheless  sought  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision and, in detailed grounds that ran to nine paragraphs  in  all,
    set out why they said permission should be granted.

 8. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein and he said at
    paragraph 2 of his reasons:

         "The application demonstrates that the  First-tier  Tribunal  panel
         may have made an error of law by failing to give  adequate  reasons
         for their findings on material matters and raises  arguable  issues
         as to whether they are entitled in law  to  reach  the  conclusions
         they did for the reasons given."

 9. It should be said that the grounds are  directed  at  certain  specific
    findings in relation to the Tribunal's alleged failure to consider  the
    level of risk, to consider the issue of offending  since  release,  the
    issue of remorse, and specifically the issue  about  ties  in  Nigeria.
    Perhaps it should be noted, although not  strictly  relevant,  that  we
    have had the opportunity  to  consider  those  criticisms  and  we  had
    reached, in any event, a preliminary view that there was  no  substance
    in fact to the criticisms made of the Tribunal who,  in  our  judgment,
    did consider quite thoroughly and carefully each of  those  issues  and
    reached, in respect of those issues, findings that it was  entitled  to
    make.

10. In any event, today Mr Parkinson on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State
    has conceded that the finding of fact in relation to the application of
    Rule 399A(b) cannot sensibly be challenged on any  basis.   There  were
    primary facts before the Tribunal upon which it was  entitled  to  make
    the finding that it did and Mr Parkinson quite  correctly  acknowledges
    that that finding cannot be impugned.

11. On that basis, the Tribunal  was  driven  to  the  conclusion  that  it
    reached that it had to allow the appeal under the Rules themselves  and
    in those circumstances Mr Parkinson has frankly  acknowledged  that  he
    cannot properly maintain this appeal.

12. In those circumstances, we  formally  dismiss  the  appeal  and  simply
    formally note that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal continues to
    stand.

    Tribunal
