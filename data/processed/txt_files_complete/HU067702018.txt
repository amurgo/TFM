                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Iran who came to the United Kingdom on
      15 September 2015. She had entry clearance as the spouse of Mr Masoud
      Mahmondi, hereinafter referred to as her sponsor. They married on 24
      August 2010 in Iran.

   2. The sponsor is also from Iran. He came here 13 years ago as an asylum
      seeker. He was granted indefinite leave to remain on 4 March 2010
      under the legacy scheme.

   3. The appellant had entry clearance until 23 March 2018.On 7 March 2018
      she applied for further leave to remain. This was refused the same day
      on the sole ground that she had not demonstrated by the proofs in
      appendix FM SE of the rules the necessary income of �18,600.

   4. Her appeal was heard at Birmingham on 31 July 2018 before First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Broe. Consideration of the appeal was restricted to
      article 8 grounds. Her ability to meet the rules was relevant in
      assessing the proportionality of the decision.

   5. In a decision promulgated on 6 August 2018 her appeal was dismissed.
      The only issue arising related to finance. Her husband had recently
      become a director of a company and worked in the business along with
      his wife. There was also a 2nd business they both worked in.

   6. At paragraph 6 of the decision the judge referred to the appellant's
      evidence that she and her sponsor were employed by Coyan Limited and
      her income was �13,200 and his income was �6240, giving a total of
      �19,440. They both began work on 1 September 2017. On 20 October 2017
      she began work also for a company known as Fuel Juice Bars Limited
      earning a further �9750.

   7. The refusal decision noted the latter earnings. The appellant had
      provided payslips and personal bank statements showing earnings from
      Coyan Limited. However, she had not provided the specified documents
      in appendix FM SE. As the company was only incorporated on 7 September
      2017 it was not possible to provide the evidential requirements
      covering a full financial year. The judge concluded that the
      application could not satisfy the evidential requirements of appendix
      FM SE.

   8. By the time of hearing the sponsor had resigned as a director and
      payslips had been submitted from March to June 2018 but these did not
      satisfy the 6 months requirement in appendix FM SE.

   9. The judge did not see insurmountable obstacles to family life
      continuing in Iran and found EX 1 did not apply. The judge noted that
      her sponsor had returned to Iran on several occasions. At paragraph 23
      onwards the judge refers to the appellant's article 8 rights and
      accepted the existence of family life. At paragraph 27 the judge
      referred to the effect of a negative decision: likely, the appellant
      would have to return to Iran. The judge said her sponsor could travel
      with her or else support her from here. The judge concluded that
      decision was proportionate.

The Upper Tribunal

  10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the basis it
      was arguable, given the absence of clear finding that the financial
      requirements was not met de facto, the judge erred in attaching
      excessive weight to the evidential requirements in the rules. The
      judge was considering the appeal from the point of view of article 8
      albeit initially through the prism of the rules.

  11. I have received a skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant which
      helpfully tabulates the income in respect of the period September 2017
      to February 2018. The joint income amounted to �28,541: well in excess
      of the threshold. I was provided with a copy of the decision of
      Philipson (ILR-not PBS: evidence) India [2012] UKUT 00039 which made
      the point at paragraph 22 that when considering article 8 the new
      evidence was relevant. It was necessary to look behind the aim for the
      financial threshold.

  12. Mr Hussain for the appellant submitted that the judge should have
      considered whether in reality the financial threshold was met. He
      submitted the outcome was not proportionate. The appellant had arrived
      in the United Kingdom for the purposes of settlement. Whilst her
      husband can visit Iran it   would cause significant disruption.

  13. The presenting officer accepted that the judge materially erred by not
      considering the joint incomes and the reality of whether the financial
      threshold was met.

  14. Both representatives were in agreement to my finding a material error
      of law and setting the decision aside. In the circumstance it was
      suggested I remake the decision allowing the appeal. Bearing in mind
      the only issue in dispute this is the appropriate course

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Broe materially errs in law and
set aside. I remake the decision allowing the appeal.
