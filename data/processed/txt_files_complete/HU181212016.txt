                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Secretary of State in
relation to a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Oliver promulgated on
27 February 2019 in which he allowed an appeal by the respondent on human
rights grounds.

For the sake of clarity and continuity I will in this judgment refer to
Miss P as the appellant and the Secretary of State as the respondent as
they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

The grounds upon which the Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal
and the basis upon which permission was granted are that the judge arguably
erred in finding that the appellant had established a family life with her
friend and her friend's children. The Secretary of State submitted this did
not amount to family life for the purposes of article 8 as there is no
family relationship. It is further submitted that the judge erred in
failing to consider the statutory considerations outlined in section 117B
of the Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which rendered his balancing
exercise in the assessment of proportionality flawed.

In as much as the judge found that the Secretary of State's proposed
interference with the appellant's private and new family life would be
disproportionate I do not find the reference to family life to be a
material error of law.  Even if it does not amount to family life it
certainly amounts to compelling private life and the judge allowed the
appeal also on private life grounds.

However, I agree that the judge's failure to deal at all with section 117B,
which he was required to do, amounts to an error of law which could be
material to the outcome.

The First-tier Tribunal was considering Article 8 outside the Immigration
Rules.

For that reason I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and,
both representatives accepting it was the appropriate way forward,
indicated that I would redecide the appeal on the evidence that was before
the First-tier Tribunal as set out in the judge's decision and not disputed
by the Secretary of State.

The appellant, born on the 23 February 1993 arrived in the UK on 23 October
2010 with leave as a student, which was then extended until 6 November
2015. Although an attempt was made to curtail her student leave, that was
never served upon her and so she has at no time been without leave. That
was the finding of the First-tier Tribunal and has not been challenged by
the Secretary of State.

On 20 September 2015 the appellant applied for further leave to remain,
relying on her article 8 private life rights, in particular her mental
health difficulties.

The appellant, although a national of Bangladesh, was born in Dubai where
her father worked. She has never lived in Bangladesh and does not speak
Bengali.

The appellant is the youngest of five sisters born to a father who wanted
boys. They were forced to study Islamic studies at school in Dubai. The
appellant's mother had been married at the age of 9 to an older man and had
suffered miscarriages before marrying the appellant's father who used to
beat her. In turn, the appellant's mother used to beat the appellant, while
at other times showering love upon her. The appellant had come to the
realisation that her mother had a mental disorder. The appellant recalled a
time when her second elder sister was tied to a bedpost screaming while she
was exorcised by clerics. The appellant herself was bullied at school and
as her mother was diabetic there was a lot of medication around the house
which the appellant would steal to make herself sick and hope to die. Her
father told that she was adopted because as a dark-skinned girl she could
not possibly be his daughter.

The appellant recalled an occasion when her father took her to a strange
place where there were other men. She was on the floor crying and her dress
kept going up and she wanted to keep it down. She did not remember what
happened afterwards but said that she felt disgusted and embarrassed even
to write it down and later to tell doctors. Although her father gave the
impression of being a strong Muslim he was not a good man.

The appellant's mother suffered a stroke and after that was kind to the
appellant.

The appellant's eldest sister was forcibly married to a man in Bangladesh
and was trapped in an abusive marriage.

There came a time when the appellant's mother said she felt guilty and told
the appellant that she had helped her sister start a new life in the UK and
she facilitated the appellant's application for entry clearance to enter
the UK to study.

In the UK the appellant started to self-harm and became paranoid. She lost
her faith, convinced she was possessed by some Jinn and rebelled against
everything she had been taught as a child. She got three tattoos on the
same day, including one with verses from the sora of the Koran. Although
she has several tattoos that one was particularly offensive to Muslims and
she had been screamed at in Whitechapel by a Muslim woman.

The appellant's mental health issues became worse and was diagnosed with an
emotionally unstable personality disorder and has been admitted to
psychiatric units under sections of the Mental Health Act. The First-tier
Tribunal determination refers three such admissions but the appellant's
representative informed me that there have been five.

Although initially living with her sister, brother-in-law and their child
in the UK she has more recently come to live with a friend, Mrs P and her
children. That lady is the only person to whom the appellant has told all
the details of her life.  She encouraged the appellant to try counselling
for her childhood sexual abuse and introduced her to hypnotherapy.

The appellant has come to the belief that she might be asexual and has an
aversion to physical relationships. She does not consider herself Muslim
anymore and has joined the Council of ex-Muslims of Great Britain.

The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from Mrs P, who explained that she
had been the appellant's close friend for 2 ï¿½ years. She was widowed seven
years earlier and the appellant came to live with her family in response to
an advertisement for a tenant.

She bonded with her children and gradually started to describe her troubled
early life.

On one occasion the appellant moved away temporarily and her sister
contacted Mrs P informing her that she been sectioned after trying to take
her own life. Mrs P supported the appellant while she was in hospital and
welcomed her home when she was discharged. The appellant has attempted to
take her own life on more than one occasion and on one occasion Mrs P and
the nanny had to prevent the appellant trying to jump out of a third-floor
window. That precipitated a further admission to hospital

There was ample evidence before the First-tier Tribunal of the severity of
the appellant's mental health and repeated suicide attempts and continuing
suicidal ideation. There was also background evidence before the Tribunal
confirming that tattoos are not accepted by Muslims. Although requesting an
oral hearing the appellant did not in fact attend the hearing before the
First-tier Tribunal, the judge concluding that was as result of her
vulnerable state.

The factual background to this case was not disputed by Ms Kenny. It was
her submission that taking into account the requirements of section 117B
the appellant's removal was proportionate. Her main argument was the public
interest and in particular the high cost to the taxpayer of her severe
mental health issues.  She submitted there was no evidence that they could
not be dealt with in Bangladesh. The appellant was unable to support
herself and was unlikely to be able to do so for the foreseeable future.
She said there was no evidence the appellant could not access shelter and
support in Bangladesh and have her medical needs met there.

In assessing a human rights claim, it is trite law that this must be done
through the lens of the Immigration Rules. It is accepted that the
appellant cannot bring herself within the provisions of Appendix FM.  It
was however argued that she could bring herself within the provisions of
paragraph 276 ADE (1) (vi) namely that she has lived in the UK for less
than 20 years but there are very significant obstacles to her integration
into the country to which she would have to go if required to leave the UK.

Although she has visited Bangladesh the appellant has never lived there and
does not speak the language. She does not read or write Bengali. Her mother
is now deceased and her father remarried. Her birth father's behaviour
towards her as a child was appalling and indeed included sexual abuse. She
has a sister in Bangladesh who is herself in an abusive marriage and would
not be in a position, it would appear, to assist the appellant.

The appellant has extremely severe mental health difficulties, leading as
they have to numerous compulsory admissions to hospital and she has
attempted suicide on more than one occasion and clearly presents a
significant suicide risk.

It is unclear how the appellant could access any support in Bangladesh or
accommodation or support herself.

The appellant has tattoos, at least one of which causes offence to Muslims

She is no longer a practising Muslim and indeed has joined the Council of
ex-Muslims of Great Britain.

The First-tier Tribunal referred at paragraph 31 to the appellant's tragic
and cruel family upbringing in a country not of her nationality, which has
not been disputed. That left her very damaged and ill-prepared to deal with
adult life but particularly ill-prepared to deal with the seismic
challenges she would meet on removal to Bangladesh. The damaged state in
which she arrived in the United Kingdom has previously led to bulimia and
suicidal ideation. Whilst the Letter of Refusal referred to a lack of
evidence about that, evidence in abundance has subsequently been provided
and indeed that is not now disputed by the Secretary of State.

 For all these reasons I find that there would be very significant
obstacles, even recognising that represents a high hurdle, to the
appellant's integration into Bangladesh. It would be hard indeed for a
young single woman without close family support to integrate into a country
in which she has never lived and does not speak, read or write the
language. It would to be doubly so for a young woman with this appellant's
problems.

Given that the appellant meets the requirements of paragraph 276 ADE I do
not need to go on to consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules
because TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 confirms that if
an appellant meets the Immigration Rules that is dispositive of the human
rights appeal where Article 8 is engaged. Clearly Article 8 is engaged in
this case. That being the case there is no necessity to consider s.117B

Paragraph 276 ADE is the immigration rule which deals with private life and
she succeeds on the basis that she meets the requirements of that.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed  to  the
extent that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside  as  the
conclusions are tainted by error of law.  However, in redeciding the  appeal
on the undisputed facts, the Appellant's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
State's decision to refuse her leave to remain on Human Rights  (Article  8)
grounds is allowed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
