                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hands promulgated after a hearing on 25 April 2014 which
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on 30 November 1979 and is a citizen of Turkey.

 4. The Appellant applied for entry clearance as the dependent spouse of  a
    person present in the United Kingdom with leave to  remain  as  a  self
    employed person under the EEA (Ankara) Agreement.

 5. On 23  July  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave a number of  reasons:  in  essence
    the  Appellant  had  failed  to  provide  sufficient  evidence  of  her
    sponsor's income to show that it met the threshold set out by  the  DWP
    once the cost of his accommodation had been removed ie �5509 per annum;
    the Respondent was also not satisfied that the relationship was genuine
    and subsisting.

The Judge's Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hands ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against the Respondent's
    decision. The Judge found the  relationship  between  the  parties  was
    genuine and subsisting but found that the Appellant  had  not  provided
    sufficient evidence to show that the financial requirements were met.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 12 June 2014  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pooler gave permission to appeal stating that the Judge  appeared
    to have overlooked that in the Appellant's bundle at page 9  there  was
    confirmation by HMRC that in respect of a  tax  return  to  the  period
    ending February 2013 that the Appellant had paid �4186 in respect of  a
    declared turnover of over �50,000.

 8. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr  Brown  who  relied  on  the
    grounds of appeal.

 9. On behalf of the Respondent Mr McVitie did not seek  to  argue  that  a
    material error of law had been made by the Judge who had  overlooked  a
    document from HMRC in respect of income for the period ending  February
    2013. He accepted that given that the Appellant's sponsor had paid over
    �4000 in tax for that period in issue he  must  have  been  earning  in
    excess of the sum required in the Rule.

10. He also accepted that in suggesting that the Appellant had  to  provide
    particular documents to meet the requirements  of  the  Rule  that  the
    Judge had erred as there was no requirement under this particular  Rule
    for specified documents.

Finding on Material Error

11. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made material errors of law.

12. The Appellant in this case sought entry clearance to join  her  husband
    in the United Kingdom who has leave under  the  EC  Turkey  Association
    Agreement.

13. It was accepted that the Appellant who was a self employed business man
    had to show and income of at least  �5,509.00  per  year  to  meet  the
    financial threshold under the Rules although the Appellant  claimed  to
    have an income considerably in excess of this.

14. I am satisfied that the Judge's assessment of  the  financial  evidence
    was flawed. The Judge stated in paragraph 20 of the decision  that  the
    tax returns he submitted state that accounts had been prepared for  the
    company up to 30 March 2012 and this was the most  up  to  date  return
    included in the bundle: this failed to take into account documents from
    HMRC at page 15 that covered  the  period  ending  February  2013.  The
    failure  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  address   these   documents
    constitutes a clear error of law. This error I consider to be  material
    since had the Tribunal conducted this exercise the outcome  could  have
    been different. That in my view is the correct test to apply.

15. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that the
    Judge's determination cannot stand and must be set aside in so  far  as
    it related to the income requirements, the findings in relation to  the
    parties relationship were to stand. I indicated to the parties  that  I
    would re make the decision.

16. Mr Brown was content for me to remake the decision on the basis of  the
    documents in the bundle.

17. Mr McVitie accepted that on the basis of the HMRC documents produced at
    the time of the decision the Appellant reached the income threshold.

Findings

18. The Appellant's sponsor is a self employed businessman  with  leave  in
    the United Kingdom under the ECAA (Ankara) Agreement.  The  application
    for entry clearance was refused on the basis that the sponsor failed to
    meet the financial requirements of  HC509  paragraph  35  of  the  1973
    Immigration Rules.

19. It was agreed at the time of the refusal and at the time of the hearing
    before me that the sponsor had to show  that  he  met  the  recommended
    threshold set out by the DWP once the cost  of  his  accommodation  had
    been removed and this figure was �5509 per annum.

20. The Appellant's case was that the sponsors  income  for  the  tax  year
    ending 2013 was the year that was relevant to this application and  the
    sponsors income for this year had been �20,857 and there is evidence in
    the form of a breakdown of payments schedule from HMRC confirming  that
    the sponsor paid �4186.64 tax in respect  of  his  liability  for  that
    period.

21. It was moreover conceded by Mr McVitie on behalf of the Respondent that
    given the level of tax paid by the  sponsor  paid  in  respect  of  his
    business, as confirmed in the documents from HMRC, he  must  have  been
    earning in excess of the threshold he had to meet. I agree  that  there
    was sufficient evidence to show that the Appellant's  sponsor  met  the
    financial requirements.


Decision

22. I set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
    material error of law. I substitute the following decision:

23. The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.
