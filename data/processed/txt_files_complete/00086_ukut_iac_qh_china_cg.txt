Risk to Christians in China

   1) In general, the risk of  persecution  for  Christians  expressing  and
      living  their  faith  in  China  is  very  low,  indeed  statistically
      virtually negligible. The Chinese constitution  specifically  protects
      religious freedom and the Religious Affairs Regulations 2005 (RRA) set
      out the conditions under which  Christian  churches  and  leaders  may
      operate within China.

   2) There has been a rapid growth in numbers of Christians in China,  both
      in the three state-registered churches and the unregistered or 'house'
      churches. Individuals move freely  between  State-registered  churches
      and the unregistered churches, according to their  preferences  as  to
      worship.

   3) Christians in State-registered churches

         i) Worship  in  State-registered  churches  is  supervised  by  the
            Chinese government's State Administration for Religious  Affairs
            (SARA) under the RRA.

        ii)  The  measures  of  control  set  out  in  the  RRA,  and  their
            implementation, whether by the Chinese  state  or  by  non-state
            actors, are not, in general, sufficiently severe as to amount to
            persecution,   serious   harm,   or    ill-treatment    engaging
            international protection.

       iii)  Exceptionally,   certain   dissident   bishops   or   prominent
            individuals who challenge, or are perceived to challenge, public
            order  and  the  operation  of  the  RRA  may  be  at  risk   of
            persecution,   serious   harm,   or    ill-treatment    engaging
            international protection, on a fact-specific basis.

   4) Christians in unregistered or 'house' churches

        i) In general, the evidence is that the many millions of Christians
           worshipping within unregistered churches are able  to  meet  and
           express their faith as they wish to do.

       ii) The evidence  does  not  support  a  finding  that  there  is  a
           consistent pattern of persecution, serious harm, or other breach
           of fundamental human rights for unregistered churches  or  their
           worshippers.

      iii) The evidence is that,  in  general,  any  adverse  treatment  of
           Christian communities by the Chinese authorities is confined  to
           closing down church buildings where planning permission has  not
           been  obtained  for  use  as  a  church,  and/or  preventing  or
           interrupting unauthorised public worship or demonstrations.

       iv) There may be a  risk  of  persecution,  serious  harm,  or  ill-
           treatment  engaging   international   protection   for   certain
           individual Christians who  choose  to  worship  in  unregistered
           churches and who conduct themselves in such a way as to  attract
           the local authorities' attention to  them  or  their  political,
           social or cultural views.

        v) However, unless such individual is  the  subject  of  an  arrest
           warrant, his name is on a  black  list,  or  he  has  a  pending
           sentence, such risk will be limited to the local area  in  which
           the individual lives and has their hukou.

       vi) The hukou system of individual registration in  rural  and  city
           areas, historically a rigid family-based  structure  from  which
           derives entitlement to most social and other benefits, has  been
           significantly relaxed and many Chinese  internal  migrants  live
           and work in cities where they do not have an urban hukou, either
           without registration or on a temporary residence permit (see  AX
           (family planning scheme) China CG [2012] UKUT 00097 (IAC) and HC
           & RC (Trafficked women) China CG [2009] UKAIT 00027).

      vii) In the light of the wide variation in local officials'  response
           to unregistered churches, individual Christians at risk in their
           local areas will normally be able to relocate  safely  elsewhere
           in China.  Given the scale of internal migration, and  the  vast
           geographical and population  size  of  China,  the  lack  of  an
           appropriate hukou alone  will  not  render  internal  relocation
           unreasonable or unduly harsh.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,
the appellant has been granted anonymity throughout  these  proceedings  and
after their conclusion, absent any  order  to  the  contrary  by  the  Upper
Tribunal or any other Court seised of relevant  proceedings.  No  report  of
these proceedings, in  whatever  form,  either  during  the  proceedings  or
thereafter, shall directly or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant  or  any
member of her family. Failure to comply with this  order  could  lead  to  a
contempt of court.

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of  China  born  on
    10th June 1986.  She appeals with permission against  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's
    decision to set removal directions to China, after refusing her asylum,
    humanitarian protection or leave to remain on human rights grounds. The
    appellant claims to be the daughter of  a  pastor  of  an  unregistered
    Church in China and that on return she would be at risk of persecution,
    serious harm, or breach of her fundamental human rights, by  reason  of
    her desire to proselytise on behalf of her father's church.

 2. This appeal was identified for possible country guidance on the risk on
    return for Christians in China.  Given the need for expert evidence  on
    the risk to Chinese Christians in general, as well as this appellant in
    particular, the appeal was adjourned for further  evidence  and  it  is
    thus that it came before the Upper Tribunal, essentially on  the  issue
    of safety of return.

Issues for country guidance

 3. We clarified with the parties that the focus of  our  consideration  in
    this appeal would be on asylum, humanitarian protection and/or  Article
    3 of the ECHR rather than Article 8 of  the  ECHR,  in  answer  to  the
    following question:

         'To what extent do Christians in China have the ability or  freedom
         to openly or publicly profess and practise  their  faith?  Such  to
         encompass the ability to proselytise and to associate  with  others
         of their faith.'

     Inextricably linked with that question:-

         'To what extent  and  in  what  circumstances  do  Christians  face
         persecution in China?'

 4. The following determination, to which we have both  contributed,  takes
    account of all the oral and documentary material before  us,  including
    the written and oral arguments of both parties.

Country evidence

 5. We had the benefit of a significant amount of  both  oral  and  written
    country evidence. The evidence before us is listed  and  set  out  more
    fully in the following Appendices:

           a) Appendix A. A full list of  all  material  before  the  Upper
              Tribunal, together with links to relevant websites  on  which
              that evidence may be found.

           b) Appendix B. Evidence regarding the number  of  Christians  in
              China and the recent rapid growth of  Christianity,  in  both
              the official state-registered churches and  the  unregistered
              'house' churches.

           c) Appendix C. The evidence of Professor Mario Aguilar, Chair of
              Religion and Politics at the School of Divinity  (St.  Mary's
              College) of the University of St  Andrews,  which  was  given
              both in his expert report of 23rd May 2013 and orally at  the
              hearing. The report and relevant  attachments  are  contained
              within bundle A in the documents before the  Upper  Tribunal,
              and consist of some 109 folios.

           d) Appendix D. The evidence of the Very Reverend Dr  Christopher
              Hancock, Chaplain  of  St  Peter's  College  Oxford,  in  his
              February 2013 report, 'Risks to Christians in China Today'.

    specifically invited and we have had regard to all  the  documents  and
    evidence before us  at  the  hearing.   Particular  areas  of  evidence

 Background

 7. Christianity in China has long roots, dating back to the middle of  the
    7th century AD, and is now said to be  the  fastest  growing  religious
    group in China. The population of China now stands at between 1.6 and 2
    billion people. It is very difficult to establish the number of  people
    practising Christianity in China.  The 2010 data published  by  China's
    State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) estimated that in the
    registered churches there were some 6 million Catholics and 23  million
    Protestants.  We were not taken to more recent figures from the Chinese
    authorities.

 8. Other sources  suggest  much  larger  numbers  of  Christians,  if  the
    registered and unregistered ('house') churches are taken into  account.
    An article by Fiscal News Service dated March 2012 indicated that there
    were some 20 to 40 million  registered  Christians  in  China.    Other
    sources suggest, having  regard  to  the  registered  and  unregistered
    churches, that the real figure is between 70-80 million Christians,  of
    whom approximately 10 million are  Catholic  and  the  remaining  60-70
    million Protestant.   We do not consider that  overall  much  turns  on
    these calculations, since the fact of large numbers of  Christians  and
    exponential growth in the  Christian  community,  both  registered  and
    unregistered, is accepted in all the sources before us.

Chinese legal framework

 9.  The  Chinese  State  recognises  three  Christian  religious   bodies,
    membership of which is open to adult Chinese citizens (aged  over  18).
    There are two Protestant organisations,  the  China  Christian  Council
    (CCC) and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and in addition, the
    Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA).  Forms of worship in  the
    State churches are prescribed and state-controlled by SARA, pursuant to
    the Religious Affairs Regulations 2005 (the RRA). Most of the  evidence
    before us deals with the workings of the Protestant TSPM.

10. In addition, millions of Chinese practise Christianity in  unregistered
    churches, which are by their nature untrammelled by the restrictions on
    forms and substance of worship  which  apply  to  the  State-recognised
    churches.

Chinese Constitution

11. The preamble to the constitution of the  People's  Republic  of  China,
    adopted on December 4 1982, says that:

         "...This Constitution affirms the achievements of the struggles  of
         the Chinese people of  all  nationalities  and  defines  the  basic
         system and basic tasks of the  State  in  legal  form;  it  is  the
         fundamental law of the State and has supreme legal  authority.  The
         people of all nationalities, all state organs,  the  armed  forces,
         all political parties and public organizations and all  enterprises
         and undertakings in the country must take the Constitution  as  the
         basic norm of conduct, and they have the duty to uphold the dignity
         of the Constitution and ensure its implementation."

12. At Article 36, the Constitution protects religious freedom:

         "Article 36.  Citizens of the  People's  Republic  of  China  enjoy
         freedom of religious belief.  No state organ,  public  organisation
         or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to  believe
         in, any religion; nor may they discriminate  against  citizens  who
         believe in, or who do not  believe  in  any  religion.   The  State
         protects normal religious activities.   No  one  may  make  use  of
         religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order,  impair
         the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system  of
         the State.  Religious bodies and religious affairs are not  subject
         to any foreign domination."

Regulations on Religious Affairs (no 426) 2005

13. On 30 November 2004, the State Council  of  the  People's  Republic  of
    China passed the Religious Affairs Regulations  (No  426),  which  came
    into force on 1 March 2005. The religious structure there  set  out  is
    administered by SARA. The Chinese government recognises  five  official
    religions: Buddhism, Catholicism,  Islam,  Protestantism,  and  Taoism.
    The Regulations do not as expressed limit the  Christian  organisations
    which can be registered; rather, they create a  registration  structure
    applicable to  all  religious  bodies  and  places  of  worship,  while
    protecting freedom of religion and of worship.

14. Article 2 of the Regulations provides for religious freedom  in  China,
    subject to registration of religious groups  and  to  social  controls.
    Article 3 distinguishes between 'normal religious activities'  and  the
    use of religion to 'upset social order, harm the health of citizens, or
    obstruct the State education system, or to engage in  other  activities
    that harm national interests, social welfare, or the lawful rights  and
    interests of citizens '.  Article 4 provides inter alia that  religious
    groups, places of worship and religious affairs 'shall not be under the
    control of a foreign power'.

15.  Articles  6-11  regulate  the  religious  groups   and   provide   for
    applications to register religious groups or academies to the religious
    affairs department of the province where the group wishes to operate.

16. Arts 12-26 and 30-37 provide what is essentially a planning system  for
    places of religious worship, including the right of religious groups to
    own property; penalties for breach are set out at arts 38-46, including
    a provision at Article 46 for  administrative  reconsideration  of  the
    actions of SARA thereunder.  Arts 27-29 require  religious  instructors
    to be certified by the religious group and to notify their  appointment
    or resignation to the religious affairs department at the county  level
    or  higher.   In  presiding  over  religious  activities,  rites,   and
    research, religious instructors 'shall receive the  protection  of  the
    law'.

Country evidence

US Commission  on  International  Religious  Freedom  (USCIRF)  2013  Annual
Report

17. This report notes that the Chinese Constitution guarantees the  freedom
    of religion, but protects only 'normal religious activities':  it  does
    not explicitly protect the  right  of  individuals  to  manifest  their
    beliefs without state interference. Reflecting the tight control  which
    the Chinese government seeks to exercise on  religious  groups,  USCIRF
    notes that the majority of religious practice  in  China  falls  within
    prohibited categories, creating large  problems  for  the  government's
    religion policies. Chinese government officials, at many  levels,  view
    religious organizations  as  an  extension  of  state  policy.  Hostile
    remarks made by the head of the United Front Work Department (UFWD)  in
    an April 2012 speech, referred to removing  the  'chaff'  of  religious
    practice so to better promote socialist society.

18. USCIRF expresses concerns as to religious freedom in  China,  which  is
    listed as a Tier 1 country of particular international concern:

         'Poor  religious   freedom   conditions   in   China   deteriorated
         significantly,  particularly  for  Tibetan  Buddhists  and   Uighur
         Muslims. To stem the growth of independent Catholic and  Protestant
         groups, the government  detained  and  arrested  leaders,  forcibly
         closed churches, and selected Catholic bishops without the approval
         of the Vatican. The Falun  Gong,  and  other  groups  deemed  'evil
         cults',  face  long-term  imprisonments,  forced  renunciations  of
         faith, and torture in detention.'

19. USCIRF recorded that China is a signatory to the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights[1] but considered that  China's  existing
    laws did not fully ratify or apply the  Convention's  legal  framework,
    particularly freedom of religion or belief.  That was not impeding  the
    extraordinary growth in religion within China, however:

         'Despite  restrictions,   harassment,   arrests,   and   government
         oversight, the number of religious adherents continues to  grow  in
         China and the government continues to tolerate regular  and  public
         worship activities of both legally-approved and  some  unregistered
         religious groups. Tolerance  for  unregistered  religious  activity
         often varies, depending on province, locality, or relationship with
         provincial government officials. The government  continues  to  use
         law to restrict religious activity and manage religious groups.'

20. USCIRF noted that the RRA continue to govern China's  religion  policy,
    having been further updated in 2007.  The content  of  the  Regulations
    has already been set out.  During 2012, SARA  had  announced  plans  to
    issue new  legal  guidelines  governing  the  religious  activities  of
    foreigners, the granting of degrees in religious training schools,  and
    the management  of  the  foreign  relations  of  religious  groups;  in
    February 2012, SARA and five other government agencies issued a  public
    opinion  that  appeared  to  encourage   participation   of   religious
    organizations in charitable activities.

21. The U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on  China  (CECC),  in  its
    February  2012  Opinion,  emphasised  the  continuing  supervision   of
    religious groups, which China regarded as necessary in order  to  guide
    the mutual adaptation of religion and socialist  society.  The  Chinese
    government  aimed  to  guide  unregistered  Christian  groups   towards
    affiliation   with   government-sanctioned   groups,   to   stop    the
    proliferation  of  'unregistered  folk  religion'  groups,  which  were
    perceived as promoting superstition.

22. Members of the Christian community were said to  have  'consistently...
    not joined officially-sanctioned religious organizations' in  order  to
    withhold  the  names  and  contact  information  of  worshippers,   the
    submission  of  leadership  information  to  the  government  or  local
    authorities,  or the seeking  of  advance  permission  for  'all  major
    religious activities or theological positions'.   Government  oversight
    was regarded with suspicion, 'given past persecution'.

23. The  Chinese  government  continued  to  'restrict  peaceful  religious
    expression and the expansion of  religious  ideas  or  worship  on  the
    Internet' and to confiscate or punish individuals for the  distribution
    of unapproved Bibles and interpretations of religious texts but a  wide
    array of religious materials  and  books  was  available  for  purchase
    without restriction in state-approved bookstores.

US Congressional-Executive Commission on China

24. The United States China Congressional-Executive  Commission  report  is
    published annually and is in the public domain.  In  its  2013  report,
    under the heading 'Freedom of Religion',  the  Commission  reported  as
    follows:

         ".   The  Chinese  government's  legal  and  policy  framework  for
         religion violates international human rights standards for  freedom
         of religion, including Article 18 of the Universal  Declaration  of
         Human  Rights.  Although  the  PRC  Constitution  states  that  all
         citizens enjoy ''freedom of religious belief,'' it limits citizens'
         ability to exercise  their  beliefs  by  protecting  only  ''normal
         religious activities.'' The government continued to recognize  only
         five   religions-Buddhism,   Catholicism,   Taoism,   Islam,    and
         Protestantism-for limited state protections for religious activity,
         and the government has continued to  outlaw  some  belief  systems,
         thereby denying members of these communities the right to  practice
         their faith openly and without fear of government reprisal.

         .    Strict  ideological  control  and  government  oversight  over
         religious groups was maintained through religious affairs  bureaus,
         the Communist Party's United Front Work Department,  and  the  five
         ''patriotic''  religious  associations,  one  for   each   of   the
         recognized religions. All clergy and  religious  organizations  are
         required to be registered with  the  government.  A  top  religious
         official announced that all clergy would be registered by  the  end
         of  2013.  This  past  year,  central  government  officials   also
         announced a plan to loosen  some  registration  and  administrative
         hurdles on social organizations that explicitly excluded  religious
         organizations. ...

         .     Observers  contend  Chinese  policies  have  divided  Chinese
         Catholics into ''official'' and ''underground'' churches. Catholics
         in China continue to be denied the freedom to accept the  authority
         of the Holy See to select bishops, and  a  new  regulation  on  the
         selection of bishops that took effect in  April  2013  expands  the
         State's role in  the  selection  process  and  explicitly  requires
         bishop  candidates  to  ''endorse  the  Chinese  Communist  Party's
         leadership and  the  socialist  system.''  Officials  at  state-run
         Catholic organizations announced in December a decision  to  revoke
         the title of auxiliary bishop from bishop Thaddeus Ma  Daqin  after
         he  publicly  withdrew  from  the  State-run   Catholic   Patriotic
         Association  at  his  ordination  ceremony  in  July  2012.  Clergy
         continue to be detained for their underground activity  or  refusal
         to join the patriotic association, including  priest  Song  Wanjun.
         ...

         .    The Chinese government continued to control the  doctrine  and
         activities of its official Protestant church and target members  of
         unregistered house churches for harassment,  detention,  and  other
         forms of abuse. The government continued its  efforts  to  prohibit
         worship gatherings of the Beijing Shouwang Church, a  house  church
         of over 1,000 congregants  in  Beijing  municipality,  denying  the
         church's  appeal  against  local  public  security  officials   for
         preventing the church from moving into property it  had  purchased.
         State-sanctioned raids on house churches continued. In April  2013,
         local authorities raided a  house  church  in  Alxa  League,  Inner
         Mongolia Autonomous Region, firing tear gas, detaining  members  of
         the  congregation,  and  beating  others.  Officials  in   Shenzhen
         municipality detained house church pastor Cao Nan  and  others  for
         holding a religious gathering in a public park,  and  officials  in
         Shanxi  province sentenced Li Wenxi and Ren Lancheng for  ''illegal
         business operations'' in connection with the printing  and  selling
         of religious publications.  ...

         .    Despite lacking formal central  government  recognition,  some
         religious communities have been able to operate  inside  China  and
         continue  to  appeal  to  the  Chinese   government   for   greater
         recognition."

Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) and 'The Empty Cross '

25. VOM's publication The Empty Cross was written in 2001 and last  updated
    in 2008.  Its content underlies much  of  the  other  country  evidence
    before us.  In addition to setting out the Seven  Rules,  VOM  in  2001
    identified a number of perceived  problems  with  China's  approach  to
    Christianity:

         . Evangelising is illegal
         . Parents cannot teach their children about Christ.
         . Pastors are appointed by the Communist state.
         . Pastors may not visit other TSPM churches.
         . Pastors are required to submit copies of their sermons to the
           authorities for censoring.
         . New churches are not permitted unless authorized by the State.

26.  The  report  criticised  the  theological  training  provided  in  the
    Christian theological schools run  by  the  Protestant  TSPM  and  CCC,
    saying that Chinese state seminaries aim at educating as pastors  those
    who are politically in support  of  the  leadership  of  the  Communist
    Party, thereby seeking to adapt Christianity to socialism, causing  the
    Chinese churches to lose  their  religious  quality  and  dividing  the
    Chinese Protestant church, in particular.  Pastors with an  evangelical
    style  to  their  sermon  presentations  are  routinely  removed   from
    prominent or visible positions or placed in the countryside.

27. When dealing  with  'party  members  or  true  believers',  the  writer
    considered that the position of TSPM leaders was unclear, in particular
    as to whether they were true Communist Party members or true believers.
     The report stated that 'gangster pastors',  without  any  faith,  were
    being given leading positions such that the TSPM had  reached  a  stage
    where it was unacceptable to both society and  the  true  Church.  TSPM
    Christianity  was  considered  to  be  devoid  of  Christian  theology.
    Registration of worshippers and churches was seen as  a  means  whereby
    foreign  influences  could  be  restricted  or  controlled  and  public
    expression and worship monitored.

28. Part of the explanation offered by VOM in 2008 for  the  resurgence  of
    unregistered churches was that the structure of the registered churches
    was insufficient to cater for the religious needs of those  who  wished
    to be associated with the  wider  Christian  church,  leading  many  to
    return to the less formal structure of worship at  home  in  a  'house'
    church, despite the prohibition in the seventh Rule  against  preaching
    outside state-registered churches or receiving evangelists into  homes,
    churches or meeting points.

ChinaAid

29. ChinaAid is an organisation  based  in  Midland,  Texas.   Its  mission
    statement describes it as an international non-profit  Christian  human
    rights organization committed to promoting religious  freedom  and  the
    rule of law in China. ChinaAid's founder  and  President  Pastor  'Bob'
    Xiqiu Fu was one of the  student  leaders  demonstrating  in  Tiananmen
    Square in 1989. In 1996, having founded his own house church  in  China
    with his wife, he was imprisoned for illegal evangelism and left  China
    for America.

30.   In 2002, Pastor Fu founded ChinaAid 'to promote religious freedom  in
    China and raise worldwide awareness of the ongoing  unjust  persecution
    of religious believers in China'.   He  attended  (by  invitation)  the
    Nobel Ceremony at which Liu Xiaobo received the Nobel Peace  Prize  and
    regularly gives evidence on reports  of  abuses  in  China,  especially
    violations of Chinese citizens' right  to  religious  freedom,  to  the
    United Nations, the CECC, and other influential agencies. ChinaAid  now
    also  supports  legal  defence  in  religious  persecution   incidents,
    academic research on the rule of law, and ministering to  and  training
    of house church leaders in China.

31. We were asked to consider a report published  on  4  February  2013  by
    ChinaAid entitled '2012 Annual Report: Chinese  Government  Persecution
    of Christians and Churches in Mainland  China,  January-December  2012'
    and, as well as a number of specific press reports from  ChinaAid.  The
    2012 report is said to demonstrate  a  42%  increase  in  incidents  of
    'persecution'[2] affecting Christians in China.

32. In 2006, there were 46 incidents, with 665 Christians 'persecuted', and
    650 people detained[3].  That figure rose over the years to,  in  2011,
    93 incidents (4322 people 'persecuted' and 1289  people  detained);  in
    2012,  132  incidents  (4919  people  'persecuted'  and   1441   people
    detained).  In  particular,  the  headline  number  of  incidents  rose
    between 2011 and 2012 by 41.9%, while the number  of  persons  affected
    rose more slowly, with those  'persecuted'  up  by  13.8%  and  numbers
    detained up by 11.8%.

33. A table at page 4 of the report records that in China  as  a  whole,  4
    Christians were sentenced in 2011, and 9 in 2012.  In 2011  there  were
    24 incidents described as 'abuse'.[4] In tabular form, the  information
    provided is as follows:

                                 Appendix B

        Christianity in China - the Churches and their congregations


Evidence relating to the number of Christians in China

   1. A helpful starting point in our consideration of this  matter  is  the
      report published by  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  of  Canada
      'China: Estimates of the Number of  Christians,  Particularly  in  the
      Provinces of Fujian, Guangdong and Liaoning' published on 19th October
      2012.

   2. It provides an estimate of  between  40  to  130  million  Christians.
      Various sources are cited in the body of the report.   One  particular
      report on Christianity published by Pew Research Centre 2011 indicated
      that there were significant challenges in estimating the size  of  the
      Christian population, with numbers ranging between 1% and  8%  of  the
      population as a whole.  There  were  a  lack  of  questions  regarding
      religion on the national  census  and  the  membership  in  unofficial
      churches.  Statistics on religion were a  sensitive  topic  for  local
      officials as well as indeed for believers  who  did  not  want  to  be
      identified.

   3. The estimate of Christians in Fujian is based on an assessment of Asia
      Harvest, a US non-profit organisation, which identifies in excess of 5
      million Christians in the province, which represented  14.31%  of  the
      population of the province.  The same source reported that there  were
      nearly 3.5 million Protestants and almost 2 million  Catholics  within
      that figure.

   4. In Guangdong, the Asia  Harvest  survey  noted  just  over  4  million
      Christians or 4.55% of the  population  of  the  province,  comprising
      nearly 3.5 million Protestants and approaching 800,000  Catholics.  In
      Liaoning province, Asia  Harvest  noted  over  3  million  Christians,
      representing 7.11% of the provincial  population,  of  whom  nearly  3
      million were Protestants and some 423,000 were Catholics.

   5. Corroboration of the above information could not  be  found  in  other
      materials before the Upper Tribunal for this appeal.

Constitutional provisions

   6. The constitution of the People's  Republic  of  China  makes  specific
      reference to religious freedom:

         'Article 36

         Citizens of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  enjoy  freedom  of
         religious  belief.   No  state  organ,   public   organisation   or
         individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in,
         any religion;  nor  may  they  discriminate  against  citizens  who
         believe in, or who do not  believe  in  any  religion.   The  State
         protects normal religious activities.   No  one  may  make  use  of
         religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order,  impair
         the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system  of
         the State.  Religious bodies and religious affairs not  subject  to
         any foreign domination.'

The official churches

   7.     The Chinese government recognised three Christian groups among the
      five official religions, which were required to register  and  operate
      through the sanctioned state authorities.  An article by  Fiscal  News
      Service dated March 2012 indicated that  there  were  some  20  to  40
      million registered Christians in China.   Estimates  for  unregistered
      Christians varied wildly from 40 million, which  were  the  government
      figures, to 80 million from other  sources.   It  was  estimated  that
      there were 70 million Protestants and  10  million  Catholics  in  the
      unregistered churches.

   8.     The data published from China's state administration for religious
      affairs estimated some 6 million registered Catholics and  23  million
      registered Protestants.  Such were figures in 2010  rather  than  more
      recently.

The Seven Rules: Christianity or socialism

   9.     The Seven Rules for Christians in registered churches in China are
      conveniently set out in The Empty Cross report  by  Dr  Tom  White  of
      Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and referred  to
      in other publications we have seen.  They reflect the concerns of  the
      Communist authorities as to the perceived conflict between the aims of
      socialism and Christianity, and are as follows:

    (1)  (Christian believers) must fervently love the People's Republic of
         China, support the leadership of the Chinese  Communist  Party  and
         the people's government, uphold the unification of  the  motherland
         and the harmony among ethnic groups, and work  steadfastly  on  the
         road to socialism.

    (2)  (Christian  believers)  must  strictly  abide  by  all  the  laws,
         regulations, politics of the Communist  Party  and  the  State  and
         strive to be patriotic and law abiding citizens.

    (3)  (Christian believers) must actively work to increase the  material
         wealth  and  cultivate  good  spiritual  morals  of  the  socialist
         civilisation.  They must comply with the government's labour  codes
         and  strive  to  contribute  to  the  development  of   the   'four
         modernisations'  established  by  the  Communist  Party.   If  such
         scheduled religious activities are in conflict with production  and
         work schedules, the economic activities must take priority.

    (4)  A permit must be obtained from the  country  State  Administration
         for  Religious  Affairs  (Community  Party  members)  in  order  to
         establish religious meeting points.  No unauthorised meeting points
         are allowed.

    (5)  (Christian believers) must actively cooperate with the  government
         to thoroughly carry out  the  party's  religious  policies  to  the
         letter.  (They) shall not persuade and force others to  believe  in
         Christianity.  (They) shall not brainwash teenagers under  18  with
         religious beliefs.  (They) shall not bring children (under  18)  to
         religious activities.

    (6)  One should see a doctor  for  medication  when  sick.   (Christian
         believers) must not resort to prayer alone for healing so not as to
         endanger people's health and lives.

    (7)  (Christian believers) shall not preach their religion outside  the
         church building and specific places which have been designated  for
         religious activities.  They shall  not  preach  itinerantly.   They
         shall not receive self-proclaimed  evangelists  into  their  homes,
         churches or meeting points.

  10. Having set out the seven rules, VOM refers to a publication  by   Carl
      Lawrence, 'The Coming Influence of China'[6], and observes  that  TSPM
      Christians are forced  to  value  socialism  above  their  faith,  and
      identifies the following problems within the Seven Rules  and  China's
      approach to Christianity:

         . Evangelising is illegal

         . Parents cannot teach their children about Christ.

         . Pastors are appointed by the Communist state.

         . Pastors may not visit other TSPM churches.

         . Pastors are required to submit copies of their sermons to the
           authorities for censoring.

         . New churches are not permitted unless authorized by the State.

  11. The  report  criticised  the  theological  training  provided  in  the
      Christian theological schools run by the TSPM and CCC, saying that the
      seminaries aim at educating as pastors those who  are  politically  in
      support of the leadership of  the  Chinese  Community  Party,  thereby
      seeking to  adapt  Christianity  to  socialism,  causing  the  Chinese
      churches to lose their religious  quality  and  dividing  the  Chinese
      Protestant church, in particular.  Pastors with an  evangelical  style
      to their sermon presentations are routinely removed from prominent  or
      visible positions or placed in the countryside.

  12. When dealing with  'party  members  or  true  believers',  the  writer
      considered that the leaders of the TSPM have a confusing identity  and
      no one knows who they are,  whether  they  are  true  Communist  Party
      members or true  believers.   It  is  said  that  'gangster  pastors',
      without any faith, are being given leading  positions  such  that  the
      TSPM has reached a stage where it is unacceptable to both society  and
      the true Church.

Regulations on Religious Affairs (no 426) 2005

  13. China's Regulations on Religious Affairs (number 426) were promulgated
      on 1st March 2005.  They are within the public domain and we refer  to
      them henceforth as the  RRA.  They  explicitly  stress  the  right  of
      freedom  of  religious  belief  and  prohibit  discrimination  against
      Chinese citizens who have a religion.

  14. Article 8 of the Regulations stresses that all religions shall  adhere
      to the  principle  of  independence  and  self-governance.   Religious
      bodies' religious  affairs  should  not  be  subject  to  any  foreign
      domination  and  may  develop  external  exchange  on  the  basis   of
      friendship and equality.

  15. Article 7 provides  that  publications  involving  religious  contents
      should not jeopardise the harmonious coexistence between religious and
      non-religious citizens or jeopardise  the  harmony  between  different
      religions.

  16. The establishment of an institution for religious education should  be
      by application for approval.  The Regulations set out  the  conditions
      that are required for such  a  religious  education.   It  essentially
      requires proper training objectives, necessary funding and proper site
      and equipment.

  17. Article 22  provides  that  in  the  case  of  large  scale  religious
      activities permission to hold such large scale  activities  should  be
      obtained in advance.  This is essentially to ensure  safety  and  good
      order.  There are also  regulations  concerning  religious  personnel,
      religious property and legal liability.





United States Commission on International Religious  Freedom  Annual  Report
    2013

  18. Our attention was drawn to  the  US  International  Religious  Freedom
      Report for 2013, and to three paragraphs of that report in particular.
       The first at page 2 is as follows:-

         'Millions of Chinese  manifest  their  beliefs  openly  and  senior
         government officials have praised religious  communities'  positive
         role in society and urged  approved  religious  groups  to  promote
         'economic and social development' and 'socialist principles'.   New
         directives we issued last year to allow approved  religious  groups
         to  conduct  some  charitable  activities.   These   are   positive
         developments  that  were  unthinkable   just   two   decades   ago.
         Nevertheless,  the  government  continues  to  see  the  growth  of
         religious communities who resist its oversight as potential threats
         to social 'harmony' or to its 'core  interests'.   Peaceful  public
         protest or worship activities are criminalised, and both  Christian
         and  Muslim  missionary  activities  are   curtailed.    Government
         authorities  praised   religious   groups   who   resist   'foreign
         infiltration', prohibiting religious  affiliation  among  Communist
         Party members and  some  government  employees,  and  restrict  the
         amount of religious materials available.   The  Chinese  government
         also restricts online  access  on  religious  information  and  the
         authority of religious communities to choose their  own  leadership
         and parents to teach their children religion, particularly  in  the
         Uighur and Tibetan areas.'

  19. At page 3, the Report states as follows:-

         'Despite   restrictions,   harassment,   arrests   and   government
         oversight, the number of religious adherents continues to  grow  in
         China and the government continues to tolerate regular  and  public
         worship activities of both legally approved and  some  unregistered
         religious groups.  Tolerance for  unregistered  religious  activity
         often varies, depending on province, locality, or relationship with
         provincial government officials.  The government continues  to  use
         law to restrict religious activity  and  manage  religious  groups.
         The  Chinese  government's  religion  policy  is  governed  by  the
         National Regulations on Religious Affairs  (RRA)  first  issued  in
         March 2005 and updated in 2007.  The  RRA  requires  all  religious
         groups  to  affiliate  with  one   of   seven   government-approved
         associations and allows  government  control  of  every  aspect  of
         religious practice and related  activities.   The  RRA  does  allow
         registered religious groups to carry out some religious  activities
         and charitable work.  When registered,  religious  communities  can
         apply or permission to  possess  property,  accept  donations  from
         overseas, conduct religious education and training and host  inter-
         provincial  religious  meetings.   The  RRA  permits  only  'normal
         religious activity' and contains vague national security provisions
         that suppress  the  peaceful  activity  of  unregistered  religious
         groups, organisations deemed cults.

         For the past  year,  State  Administration  for  Religious  Affairs
         (SARA) announced plans to issue new legal guidelines governing  the
         religious activities of foreigners,  the  granting  of  decrees  of
         religious training schools,  and  the  management  of  the  foreign
         relations of religious groups.  In February  2012,  SARA  and  five
         other government agencies issued a public opinion that appeared  to
         encourage participation of religious  organisations  in  charitable
         activities.   Nevertheless,  according  to  the  US  Congressional-
         Executive  Commission  on  China  (CECC),  the  opinion  emphasises
         'supervision'  and  'guiding  religion  and  socialist  society  to
         mutually adapt' remains difficult for approved religious groups  to
         establish a charity and legally impossible for unregistered groups.

         The government  seeks  to  'guide'  unregistered  Christian  groups
         toward affiliation with government sanctioned groups  and  to  stop
         the  proliferation  of  unregistered  Buddhist,  Daoist,  or   folk
         religion groups because they promote 'superstition.''

     It is difficult to  understand  what  is  meant  by  'normal  religious
    activity' and what its ambit might be in practice.



  20.     The report goes on to say:

         'The Chinese government, as part of official policy,  continues  to
         restrict  peaceful  religious  expression  and  the  expansion   of
         religious ideas or worship  on  the  Internet.  It  confiscates  or
         punishes individuals for the distribution of unapproved Bibles  ...
         It also blocks access to Internet  sites  of  religious  groups  or
         those with 'illegal' religious content. Nevertheless, a wide  array
         of religious materials and books is available for purchase  without
         restrictions in state-approved bookstores.'

  21.  At paragraph 11 of the report it is stated:-

         'Members of the officially-approved religious groups are subject to
         similar government oversight and restrictions, including on  issues
         of doctrine, clergy, religious activities, and religious sites. All
         agree to 'uphold the leadership of  the  Communist  Party  and  the
         socialist system,' 'participate in socialist  material,  political,
         and  spiritual  civilization,'  and  protect  'religious   harmony,
         national unity ... and world peace.''

Catholic Christianity in China

  22. The US Religious Freedom Report for 2013  at  page  7  indicates  that
      there are tensions between the government-approved 'Catholic Patriotic
      Association' (CPA) and the so-called 'underground' Catholics.  Certain
      priests and bishops continued to be imprisoned.  There are  government
      efforts to convince  or  coerce  Catholic  clergy  to  join  the  CPA,
      particularly  in  the  two  provinces  with   the   largest   Catholic
      communities, Hebei and Shaanxi.  The Chinese government  continues  to
      nominate bishops not recognised by the Holy See, and  to  place  these
      bishops in charge of both the CPA and the Catholic Bishops Council  of
      China.

  23. Notwithstanding that fact, an estimated 90% of CPA bishops and priests
      are also secretly ordained by the Vatican, and in many provinces,  CPA
      and  unregistered  Catholic  clergy  and  congregations  work  closely
      together.  In 2006, the Vatican and  CPA  worked  together  to  select
      eleven  bishops,  reversing  a  previous  trend  of   the   government
      appointing all bishops without Vatican approval.   However,  beginning
      in late 2010, the CPA ordained seven bishops without Vatican approval,
      and the Vatican ex-communicated four of them.  Three bishops  received
      prior Vatican approval, though the Chinese government is now detaining
      two of these bishops for secretly contacting the Holy See.

  24. It is said the  Chinese  authorities  continue  to  pressure  Catholic
      clergy to  affiliate  with  the  CPA  and  recognise  its  leadership.
      Priests, seminarians and some laity were forced  to  attend  political
      'education' sessions in the past year.  In January 2012,  six  priests
      from  the  Inner  Mongolian  city  of  Erenhot  were  arrested  whilst
      attempting to meet to discuss pastoral care and leaderships issues for
      unregistered Catholics in the Suiyuan dioceses.  Four of the six  were
      released within several days but the whereabouts of the other two  are
      unknown.  According to the CECC, at least forty Roman Catholic bishops
      remain in prison or detained, or were forcibly disappeared  since  the
      1970s.

Protestant Christianity in China

  25. The picture in relation to the Protestant churches also  seems  to  be
      somewhat mixed according to the US Religious Freedom Report,  at  page
      8.  In particular we note a passage as follows:-

         'The government requires all Protestant groups to register and join
         one of these officially-recognized religious  organizations;  those
         that do  not  are  technically  illegal,  though  there  is  uneven
         enforcement of this provision, with some  churches  meeting  openly
         and regularly with memberships of several hundred  to  a  thousand.
         The government largely tolerates groups that meet in  homes  or  in
         small groups,  but  continues  to  view  with  suspicion  religious
         organizations with extensive foreign ties, whose  memberships  grow
         too quickly, whose leadership  becomes  too  popular  or  organizes
         across provincial lines, or whose  religious  activities  allegedly
         disrupt ethnic or social 'harmony.''

  26.     The US Religious Freedom Report for 2011 noted that a  case  study
      indicated that 70% of Protestants worship in registered churches while
      30% do  so  in  unregistered  churches  or  private  residences.   Pew
      Research  Centre  seeks  to   attribute   regional   distribution   of
      Protestants into various  areas.   Various  reports  cited  concerning
      Catholics which would seem to  show  over  6  million  registered,  12
      million unregistered.  It is noted  that  those  come  from  imprecise
      independent estimates.  As with the Protestant churches, the number of
      registered Catholics is less than the number of unregistered.

The Empty Cross document

  27. Professor Aguilar relied heavily on a report, published  in  2001  and
      updated in 2008, by an organisation calling itself The  Voice  of  the
      Martyrs (VOM), based in Bartlesville Oklahoma, in the  United  States.
      The report is entitled 'The  Empty  Cross  :  The  False  Doctrine  of
      China's Official Church,  the  State  TSPM  Patriotic  Movement'.   It
      contains a foreword by a Dr Tom  White,  the  controversial  executive
      director  of  VOM,  who  committed  suicide  in   April   2012.    The
      organisation was previously known as 'Jesus to  the  Communist  World'
      and in the 1970s Dr White was imprisoned in Cuba  for  17  months  for
      dropping Bibles into Cuba.  Dr White had travelled to  China  to  meet
      underground Bible students just a few weeks before his death.

  28. The 2008 Empty Cross document sets out a historic timeline in relation
      to the official Protestant church: the State TSPM  Patriotic  Movement
      (TSPM), the State TSPMs being  self-government,  self-propagation  and
      self-support.  The TSPM began in 1951 and  originated  from  Community
      Party  officials  who  realised  that  Christianity  was  experiencing
      astonishing growth in China.  In charge of church leadership  at  that
      time were three foreign Christian agencies.  The  Communists  believed
      that they needed to get rid of this 'socially  disabling'  force.   By
      forming a state church, government  officials  hoped  that  the  State
      church too  would  eventually  disappear  and  that  the  interest  in
      Christianity would fade away.  However, quite the reverse  would  seem
      to have happened.

  29. To control the content  of  Christian  resources  and  materials,  the
      Communist Party established the Amity  Printing  Company  in  1987  in
      partnership with United  Bible  Societies.   Amity  Printing  produced
      Bibles and other commentaries and materials for distribution  to  TSPM
      churches.  Bibles printed at Amity were for  export  rather  than  for
      inside China.  In December 2007, that particular publisher produced 15
      million Bibles.

  30. The report provides some help as to the size of the official church in
      2008 and its growth before then.  In 1989 the  government  listed  4.5
      million registered Christians meeting  in  6,375  churches  and  2,600
      meeting points and  thirteen  seminaries.   In  2008  the  Amity  News
      Service listed 32,000 churches and 16,000 meeting points. There  would
      seem also be an increased growth rate of over 300% in  the  number  of
      baptised TSPM Christians (4.5 million in 1989 to 13 million in  1999).
      It is said that  about  six  churches  are  reopened  or  newly  built
      somewhere in China nearly every day.

  31. The same reporting agency also detailed  that  every  year  more  than
      500,000 new converts are baptised in TSPM churches.  At that rate  the
      number of TSPM Christians would double before  the  end  of  the  next
      decade.  According to TSPM, Wenzhou in Zhejiang  Province,  south-east
      China, has the highest  concentration  of  Christians  in  China  with
      600,000 Christians in a population of 7 million which is  about  8.5%.
      However, these figures come from a 1997 report and are not, therefore,
      current. The Empty Cross document cannot assist us as to  the  numbers
      of Christians after 2008, but paints a very vivid picture  as  to  the
      rapid growth of Christianity within China.   The  registered  churches
      are said to be growing, at such  a  rate  as  to  find  difficulty  in
      acquiring buildings to provide sufficient religious  support  for  its
      followers.  There is also a very rapid growth in the house churches.

FCO Report April 2011:  'Human rights and Democracy'

  32. Our attention was drawn to a report 'Human Rights  and  Democracy',  a
      publication of the 2011  Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Office,  sent  to
      Parliament and dated April 2012.  That was a  lengthy  report  but  at
      page 332 was a passage dealing with freedom of religion and belief  in
      China.  The  report  states  that  the  number  of  people  practising
      religious belief in China is growing rapidly, both  within  officially
      sanctioned  religious  organisations  and  in  informal  house  church
      movements.  It considers that the official religions do not  have  the
      capacity to serve  the  demands  of  the  religious  population.   For
      example, in  Beijing  there  were  only  twenty  registered  buildings
      serving 150,000 registered Christians.  This had led to a large growth
      in the unofficial house churches.

The Guardian Newspaper

  33. Our attention was also drawn to an article in The Guardian  newspaper,
      dated 22nd June 2012,  suggesting  that  China  should  embrace  house
      churches rather than try to curtail their growth.  The  article  noted
      that in the past three decades the economy in  China  has  flourished,
      personal freedoms have increased, and religions of all  forms  started
      to thrive.  The Chinese have been flocking  to  unofficial  houses  of
      worship with up to 1 million members of unregistered churches,  which,
      whilst technically illegal, have  been  largely  tolerated  in  recent
      months thanks to relaxed control and the government's realisation that
      religion can be a moral force to be  reckoned  with.   Statistics  are
      hard to come by, but the report notes that Protestantism is  generally
      regarded as the fastest growing religion.

  34. According to Frank Lee, a Chinese academic, the house  churches  boast
      10 million Catholics and up to 70 million Protestants.  Others put the
      figures even higher.  In an article by Lijia  Zhang,  it  is  asserted
      that the Chinese Communist Party has been struggling as  it  tries  to
      balance the  making  use  of  religion  as  a  moral  force  with  its
      inclination to control it. Her experience or sources are not cited.

BBC News

  35. We note also  an  article  from  the  BBC  News  Magazine  dated  12th
      September 2011 'Christians in China: Is the  Country  in  a  Spiritual
      Crisis?'  That article by one Tim Garden notes that  many  of  China's
      churches are overflowing as the number of Christians  in  the  country
      multiplies.  It said 'in the past,  the  repression  drove  people  to
      convert - is the cause now rampant capitalism?'  The article indicates
      that it is impossible to say how many Christians there  are  in  China
      but the numbers are exploding.  The government  says  24  million,  18
      million Protestants and 6 million Catholics, but independent estimates
      agree that that is a vast underestimate, with a conservative figure of
      60 million.

Evidence of Professor Aguilar

Written evidence

 1. Professor Mario Aguilar is Professor of Religion and  Politics  at  the
    School of Divinity at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.  He has a
    particular interest in the Churches, theology,  religion,  ritual,  and
    politics  of  Latin  America  and  Africa,  and  the  relation  between
    anthropology and biblical studies.  He  is  currently  writing  a  nine
    volume work on the social history of the Catholic Church in  Chile  and
    is involved in ongoing research in respect of religion and politics  in
    Tibet.  He has not been to China.  In part of his report  he  sets  out
    his publications and general experience.  He said that he  had  studied
    Roman Catholicism and was familiar with the theological development  of
    other churches.

 2. Professor Aguilar has assisted the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal with over 100 expert  reports  since  1994  and  had  prepared
    reports in connection with  a  country  guidance  case.   In  his  oral
    evidence, Professor Aguilar said that he himself had not been to  China
    but had worked in Tibet.  His focus of  enquiry  was  largely  from  an
    historical perspective, as the historical  narrative  shed  light  upon
    current situations and circumstances.   The  overriding  theme  of  his
    report and his oral evidence was that China is a totalitarian state and
    that for the  authorities,  religion  generally,  and  Christianity  in
    particular, is of concern because of the potential influence of foreign
    ideas and for the potential of dissident ideas  within  community.   He
    stresses that the authorities in China  seek  to  monitor  and  control
    expression of such ideas and limit the occasions and numbers of  people
    meeting together. It was difficult to quantify the number of Christians
    in China.  The population of China had risen from 1.3 billion  in  2004
    to about 2 billion today.  Among these were 40 million state-recognised
    Christians and, it was likely, many more than that who were not.

 3. Dealing with the RRA, Professor Aguilar noted in his  report  dated  []
    that the  RRA  permits  state  registered  religious  organisations  to
    possess property, publish literature,  train  and  improve  clergy  and
    collect donations.  The RRA sanctions five religious  bodies  in  their
    patriotic State-sponsored form: Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim, Catholic  and
    Protestant who were allowed to register under the 2005 religious  laws,
    those religious bodies being. In  his  opinion,  the  Regulations  were
    developed in response to the growing number of 'unofficial'  and  house
    churches that were arising, many of them challenging the State and  the
    power of the State via the internet.

 4. Within Christianity the People's Republic  of  China  (PRC)  recognised
    three large umbrella organisations that were sanctioned by  the  State:
    the Patriotic Catholic Church (PCC) and  the  two  organisations  which
    embraced the reform churches, namely the State TSPM-Patriotic  Movement
    (TSPM) and the China Christian Council (CCC).  Foreigners  are  not  to
    engage  in  religious  activities  with  their  Chinese   counterparts;
    proselytisation by foreigners and by unregistered religious  bodies  is
    also  illegal.   Professor  Aguilar's  opinion  is  that  even  Chinese
    citizens  attending  state-registered  religious  ceremonies  were  not
    entitled to practise their religion in public.  Those  who  do  so  are
    subject to arrest.

 5. Professor Aguilar contended that the religious  laws  of  China  remove
    from Christianity any power to challenge the State.  Religion  is  made
    an activity rather than a way of life.  In support of that  proposition
    he invites our attention to a document attached to his report  entitled
    The Empty Cross, which we consider in Appendix B.

 6. The Chinese authorities sought to bring all  religious  practice  under
    state  control,  including  state  oversight  of  religious   doctrine,
    appointment of religious leaders, registration of religious groups  and
    the construction of sites of worship.  Professor Aguilar went on to say
    that indeed the registration of Christian churches was  an  attempt  by
    the authorities to limit their effectiveness so  far  as  criticism  or
    gospel was concerned.  The ministers in such churches were  trained  in
    particular seminars and  bound  by  certain  rules.   Regulations  were
    devoid of the social gospel, seeking  to  prevent  any  possibility  of
    challenge.  Although the Roman Catholic Church was one that had a  very
    social gospel involving community activities, schools,  orphanages  and
    hospitals, such did not apply in the Catholic Patriotic Church.

 7. Professor Aguilar noted a joint memorandum issued in September 2011  by
    SARA and the Ministries of  Public  Security  and  Civil  Affairs,  the
    Chinese authorities stated that they  would  adopt  a  new  three-phase
    approach to wipe out unregistered house churches,  and  force  them  to
    join the official church system.  In the first phase, from January 2012
    to June 2012, the State Administration  for  Religious  Affairs  (SARA)
    secretly investigated house churches across  the  country  and  created
    files on them.  This was followed by a  wave  of  crackdowns  on  house
    churches which have continued into 2013 as part of  the  second  phase.
    Such phase entailed encouraging unregistered churches to become part of
    the official church structure.  The third phase is said to  be  due  to
    begin in 2015 and continue until 2025:  the government will  shut  down
    house churches that do not comply with  the  requirement  to  join  the
    TSPM.

 8. Professor Aguilar stated that it was very difficult to obtain objective
    data concerning the treatment  of  the  unregistered  churches  because
    China was a very large country where the local  official  functionaries
    were often a law unto themselves. It is  the  dramatic  growth  of  the
    unregistered churches  and  in  particular  the  house  churches  which
    remains of particular concern to the authorities: they present a threat
    to the authorities by reason of the freedom of  expression  which  they
    support and the ease of communication which they enjoy.

 9. Professor Aguilar  considered  that  the  evangelical  and  charismatic
    Protestant churches, so-called 'Reformed', posed perhaps  the  greatest
    problem for the Chinese authorities  because  they  were  not  churches
    which were historically accountable to other bodies or indeed used to a
    hierarchical control.  Reformed churches were unaccountable  except  to
    themselves and grew everywhere, multiplying  themselves  by  enthusiasm
    alone, and thus presented a challenge to control by the State.   Indeed
    they enabled young students in particular to meet together  to  express
    new ideas and challenge the  establishment,  which  was  considered  to
    threaten the stability of the Chinese establishment.

10. People under 40 would be those most likely  to  raise  questions  about
    democracy in China and challenge the status quo.  The authorities would
    naturally be concerned if such ideas were shared amongst more organised
    groups, particularly those linked to an internet website. There  was  a
    real fear, Professor Aguilar  contended,  amongst  the  authorities  in
    China that young people with  new  ideas  would  become  organised  and
    structured and therefore dangerous.

11. Given the practical restrictions that were imposed by  the  authorities
    in the State-registered churches, it was not surprising that many chose
    greater freedom by joining the house churches.   That  in  turn  simply
    compounded the problem.

12. Professor Aguilar maintained that from his research  and  understanding
    there was a real storm brewing in terms of  the  authorities  targeting
    unregistered house churches, and indeed that persecution was active  in
    China currently against such churches.  In paragraph 37 of  his  report
    he makes reference  to  the  article  in  Christianity  Today  of  18th
    February 2013 speaking of  persecution  being  high,  with  some  1,056
    Christians affected and the further harassment of some 750  more.   The
    latest 2013 report by Human Rights Watch is also prayed in aid in  that
    connection.

13. Fundamental to Professor Aguilar's contention  of  persecution  is  his
    assessment of a recent report by ChinaAid (March 2013)  which  suggests
    that there has been  an  increase  of  the  government's  crackdown  of
    illegal churches by some 42% over the past two years.   An  article  in
    the New American of 4th March 2013 is also cited.  ChinaAid  documented
    132 cases of government persecution involving 4,919  persons  in  2012,
    noting a 125% jump in the number of people arrested and  sentenced  for
    involvement in unauthorised Christian worship over the previous  years.
    ChinaAid noted that the Chinese  authorities  had  launched  a  focused
    program to wipe out the underground church movement,  and  details  the
    three-pronged government attack against the Church, designed  to  force
    congregations either to register with the  government  or  to  disband.
    Such has  resulted,  according  to  Professor  Aguilar,  in  much  more
    aggressive prosecution, including  detaining  church  leaders,  sending
    them to labour camps and cracking down on  the  Christian  outreach  to
    students.

14. It was his view that the authorities were indeed seeking to crack  down
    on unregistered churches.  Reference was made to page  108  to  109  of
    bundle A, which is an article from Christianity Today  dated  23rd  May
    2013, based on the ChinaAid report.  The  article  estimated  that  the
    number of Protestant house church Christians was between 45 million and
    60 million.

15. In his report Professor Aguilar cites reports of  40  Catholic  bishops
    who remain missing. He referred us to the  2009  Amnesty  International
    report which speaks of the authorities harassing,  detaining  and  ill-
    treating  members  of  unsanctioned  Christian  house   churches,   and
    confiscating or destroying their church property.  Detention, including
    re-education  through  labour  camps,  was  also  a  feature   of   the
    authorities' response.

16. A substantial proportion of  Professor  Aguilar's  report  repeats  the
    contents of an article in the New American concerning  the  experiences
    of the underground Shouwang Church in Beijing, which had  attempted  to
    hold a weekly outdoor Sunday service  in  Beijing.   Its  members  were
    arrested and detained for short periods in  police  stations  or  under
    house arrest to prevent the  service  taking  place.   Members  of  the
    congregation were detained 1,600 times in 2012,   and  at  least  sixty
    members had been evicted from their homes and nearly a dozen lost their
    jobs because they attended the church.

Oral evidence

17. Professor Aguilar was questioned on behalf of the  respondent  and  his
    attention was drawn to the report of Christian Aid and in particular to
    paragraphs 50 and 52 concerning Jiangxi  Province:  the  population  of
    Jiangxi was 40 million people and yet ChinaAid  had  quoted  but  three
    cases arising there.  Professor Aguilar stated that he had not read the
    ChinaAid report in preparing his report.  He formed his opinion  solely
    from base documents, particularly those in the German  Institute  which
    were linked with certain Chinese journals.

18. He had relied largely for his information as to what was  happening  in
    China on some fourteen individuals who he would not  name.   They  were
    younger people under 40, working with Chinese companies, and others who
    had retired or were still working in Europe.  Such individuals had told
    him that they wished for change in the Chinese leadership, noting  that
    Chinese society was offering less  freedom  than  might  reasonably  be
    expected.  Five of the fourteen individuals  attended  house  churches.
    None had experienced any difficulties with the authorities as they  had
    strong families to protect them.  Professor Aguilar said that  much  of
    his information came from conversation with these fourteen contacts and
    that twelve of them were significantly important and influential.

19. He was asked about paragraph 39 of his report in  which  he  writes  as
    follows:-

         'The consequences of arrest for unregistered Christians in the  PRC
         is certainly beatings and torture at  police  stations,  fines  and
         ongoing  harassment  by  police   and   government   functionaries,
         including the loss of  employment  and  state  benefits  for  those
         arrested.'

20. It was suggested to Professor Aguilar that that was a somewhat bold and
    general statement to make but he  continued  to  maintain  that  anyone
    arrested in China would be beaten and tortured.  He said he based  that
    comment  upon  the  years  of  reports,  particular  those  of  Amnesty
    International relating to the response to the authorities to those  who
    stood against them.  He said that abuse by Chinese police was taken for
    granted and he knew a number of prominent people who had been beaten.

21. Given the heavy  reliance  which  Professor  Aguilar  placed  upon  the
    ChinaAid report dated 2nd April 2013, his attention was  drawn  to  its
    conclusion, in these terms:-

         'China's churches, especially house churches  and  church  leaders,
         suffered great oppression and  persecution  last  year;  they  also
         demonstrated great endurance  and  perseverance.   In  this  police
         state where domestic security protection  agents  run  amok,  in  a
         society suffering a serious loss of ethic  and  morals,  and  where
         spiritual pollution is worse than  Beijing's  air  pollution,  only
         Christ's church stands out like a  lamp  in  the  dark,  preserving
         light, hope and peace like a light in the darkness.  Encouragingly,
         the church's approach of using the law to  defend  its  rights  has
         become popularised, and the awareness among Christians of using the
         law to protect their religious rights  has  risen  to  an  all-time
         high, both of which  can  powerfully  advance  the  development  of
         citizenship rights and a civil society in China, as well  as  bring
         about improvements in the rule of law.  As a Christian human rights
         organisation,  ChinaAid's  positive  influence   on   the   overall
         situation has grown day by day, bringing glory to the holy name  of
         our Lord Jesus Christ.

         By contrast, less than six months into the so-called ten year  plan
         to eradicate house churches, a power struggle  within  the  Chinese
         communist government, ignited by internal  factional  conflicts  in
         the Bo Xilai-Wang Lijun Alliance ultimately  resulted  in  a  great
         shuffle in the power structure and the purging at the end  of  last
         year of the  ultra-leftist  political  forces.   Like  grass  in  a
         wildfire they withered up in the  blink  of  an  eye.   The  church
         however is still standing firm,  flourishing  like  the  cedars  of
         Lebanon and food trees planted by the streams, bearing  much  fruit
         at the appointed time.'

     The conclusion went on  to  note  that  the  suppression  of  Christian
    churches had been temporarily eased  and  ended  on  a  positive  note.
    Professor Aguilar, having noted those comments  nevertheless  indicated
    that he was less optimistic as to any progress.

22. Asked about the availability of  Bibles  in  China,  Professor  Aguilar
    indicated that he understood that  the  Bible  Society  sells  some  40
    million Bibles in China every year:  he  considered  that  the  Chinese
    authorities encouraged the sale of Bibles because, although some Bibles
    will be bought by the registered churches, others will be bought by the
    unregistered churches and the authorities will be  able  to  trace  the
    Bibles to those particular groups and organisations.

23. Professor Aguilar explained  that  there  was  a  tension  between  the
    official and unofficial  churches,  also  indeed  within  the  official
    churches themselves.  The authorities continued to be controlling as to
    the activities  which  registered  Christians  could  carry  out.   For
    example there was no preaching and the  number  of  Christians  meeting
    together was restricted.

24. Indeed it was the increasing  concern  about  freedom  to  worship  and
    freedom to develop theology which had fuelled the  ongoing  debate  and
    the growth of the house churches as a move  away  from  the  registered
    churches.  Professor Aguilar said  that  the  problem  is  particularly
    acute in the Protestant or Reform churches, because the Catholic church
    had a more developed sense of authority.

25. The registered churches are restricted in their ability to run  schools
    or charities at a time when  there  is  a  demand  in  China  for  more
    education and more choice in education.  The restriction  on  community
    involvement comes at a time when the young people are more educated and
    demanding a greater influence in local and national affairs.

26. When pressed upon the figure of 40 million Bibles being sold  in  China
    every year, Professor Aguilar said he was confident of that number,  by
    reason of the sources of his information.


                                 Appendix D

Evidence of Dr Christopher Hancock

 1. The Very Reverend Dr Christopher Hancock  is  Chaplain  of  St  Peter's
    College,  Oxford  University.  In  addition  to  his  work  as  College
    Chaplain, Dr Hancock, a  former  Dean  of  Bradford  and  Professor  of
    theology, directs Oxford House  an  international  agency  providing  a
    consultancy service to government agencies, corporations  and  NGOs  in
    the area of  religion,  social  transformation  and  contemporary  geo-
    politics. His  research  focuses  on  religion  and  society  in  Asia,
    particularly China and India where he is  a  visiting  Professor  at  a
    number  of  leading  universities.  He  is  working  on  a  new   book,
    'Christianity & Confucianism: a dialogue between traditions'.

 2. Dr Hancock's evidence is set out in his  report,  dated  6  June  2013,
    'Risks to Christians in China Today'.  Dr  Hancock  has  visited  China
    regularly, on average three or four times a year since 2004, to  attend
    academic conferences and to lecture on Christian  theology.   His  most
    recent trip to China was in late January 2013 and his report  seeks  to
    reflect the information that was gained on that occasion.

 3. Dr Hancock sets out some of the  history.   He  seeks  to  clarify  the
    meaning of 'normal religious activity' to be such activities  occurring
    within government-sanctioned  religious  organisations  and  registered
    places of worship.  He makes specific reference to the RRA and  to  the
    constitution of China.  In his report, Dr Hancock sought to address the
    following statement:-

         'Chinese law permits official registered churches to function,  but
         (there are)  restrictions  on  (inter  alia)  training  of  clergy,
         appointment  of  bishops,  location  of  venues,   publication   of
         literature, finances, relationships with religious  groups  abroad.
         As a result of the control exercised by the  atheistic  government,
         most  Christians  in  China  choose  to  worship  in   unregistered
         churches.'

 4. Dr Hancock considered that expression to be somewhat  misleading  given
    his experience and from  conversations  with  academic  colleagues  and
    Chinese pastors in a number of areas, which indicated that  there  were
    many reasons why people choose to attend unregistered  churches.   Such
    reasons include friendship, size, locality,  pastoral  support,  ethos,
    spirituality, Bible teaching, and  a  desire  to  protest  against  the
    Chinese government, all of which were common factors drawing people  to
    the generally-smaller units of  unregistered  Christians  using  homes,
    offices, halls and sometimes purpose-specific church buildings in which
    to worship.

 5. Significantly, Dr Hancock continues in these terms:-

         'Despite some persistence of historic tension,  cross-fertilisation
         between 'registered' and 'unregistered' churches  has  become  more
         common in the last 15  to  20  years.   I  have  met  undergraduate
         students at Fudan  University  in  Shanghai  who  have  moved  from
         'unregistered'  Protestant  churches   to   'registered'   Catholic
         churches,  and  established  professionals  who  have  left   large
         'registered' churches in Beijing for the more supportive ethos  and
         Bible teaching of 'unregistered' churches.  Likewise,  I  have  met
         'unregistered'  pastors  who  have  transferred   to   'registered'
         churches and members of the 'unregistered' rural churches who  have
         moved and joined  'registered'  urban  churches.   Christianity  in
         China is, for  all  its  vibrancy  and  scale,  a  fluid,  complex,
         sometimes heterodox, often internally conflicted reality.  Talk  of
         'the control exercised by the atheistic government'  leading  'most
         Christians to  choose  worship  in  unregistered  churches',  risks
         presenting the government  as  uniformly  hostile  to  Christianity
         (when by policy and practice its ethos has been permission - if not
         proactively  supportive  -  of  Christianity   as   an   officially
         accredited social 'good' that is conducive of a  more  'harmonious'
         society). ...Indeed, it has often been pointed out to  me  that  it
         requires more courage to be 'registered' and 'known' than to remain
         'unregistered' and possibly 'unseen'.'

 6. Dr Hancock at paragraph 1.4.a of his report cites an article from 2011,
    Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), which noted that:-

         'In the  last  few  months,  the  Chinese  government  has  largely
         tolerated the unofficial house  church  movement.   Many  'average'
         Christians can practise their faith so long as they live  'quietly'
         - a very different scenario compared to the China  we  heard  about
         twenty years ago.'

    The CSW  article,  however,  went  on  to  express  concern  about  the
    increasing and recent harassment of members of a specific house church.



 7. As Dr Hancock indicates, that statement from CSW invites reflection  on
    'the potential consequences/likely risk for members of  the  unofficial
    house church movement if they were to practise their faith openly', and
    in particular,  at  what  point  in  a  person's  expression  of  their
    Christian faith are they more or less likely to attract censure  or  to
    be at some kind of risk  from  the  Chinese  authorities.   Dr  Hancock
    agreed with the Statement in the CSW article that for much of the  past
    30 years, the Chinese government's religious affairs bureau (SARA) have
    allowed members of unofficial churches to practise their  religion  and
    to live 'quietly'; indeed, there has been substantial acceptance at the
    heart  of  China's  ruling  elite  that  Christianity  constitutes   an
    important aid to social cohesion, family  life,  private  morality  and
    economic flourishing.

 8. Dr Hancock comments from his personal knowledge over the past ten years
    of teaching Christian Studies in many of China's leading  universities,
    that Christianity has been interpreted in influential circles in  China
    as the key to the economic success of Western Christendom.  Thus cities
    such as Wenzhou, the wealthiest city in China  with  an  estimated  40%
    Christian population, has many  pastoral  Christian  family  companies,
    which have been studied as an exemplar for other Chinese cities.

 9. That having been said, Dr  Hancock  considered  that  there  was  clear
    evidence of  individual  Christians  and  unregistered  churches  being
    variously subject to repressive action and threatening  behaviour.   Dr
    Hancock comments in these terms:-

         'In my experience and from narrative reports  from  Christian  NGOs
         (i.e.  China  Source,  ChinaAid   and   the   Overseas   Missionary
         Fellowships Monthly Updates) the causes and forms of this hostility
         cannot  be  neatly  summarised:  Christian  exuberance  and  folly,
         provocation of local authorities in the name of 'faithful Christian
         witness',  harsh  and  unpredictable   local   officials,   central
         government  policy  and/or  paranoia,  inflammatory  rhetoric  from
         church leaders, jealous slandering by other religious  figures  and
         members of 'registered' churches, have all been seen.  China's  way
         of pressurising an individual or a community is as  subtle  in  its
         cultural forms as it can be brutal in its  physical  manifestation.
         The  Chinese  dictum  (aptly  translated),  'kill  the  chicken  to
         frighten the  money',  captures  the  spirit  and  purpose  of  the
         vindictive abuse meted out to those who, for whatever  reason,  are
         deemed to have finally crossed a generously-drawn line ...  My  own
         sense is that over the past 30 years the Chinese  authorities  have
         been more often tolerant than vindictive, and turned a blind eye to
         international implication more  readily  than  blatant  oppression.
         Why?   Because,  as  indicated  above,  Christians  as  have   been
         generally   affirmed   as   peaceful,   economically    productive,
         responsible citizens - and their international links  have  been  a
         price the Chinese government has been willing to pay  to  safeguard
         wherever possible their overseas standing.'

10. Unpredictable local or national factors affect the risks and threats to
    Christians in unregistered churches.  The run  up  to  major  political
    events  -  including  a  change  in  leadership  -  was  almost  always
    accompanied  by   repression   of   potential   dissenters,   including
    Christians.  Dr Hancock, however, noted that paradoxes abound:

           'Three  years  ago,  in  one  northern  city,  large  numbers  of
         Christians were found celebrating Christmas publicly on the street;
         in  other  places  (Beijing  and  Shanghai)  'unregistered'  church
         Christmas services were visited by  the  police  and  property  was
         confiscated.'

11. He continues to say:

         'Whereas in many situations, the sharing of faith privately is risk-
         free for 'unregistered' Christians, street evangelism,  worship  in
         public places (parks, shopping malls, street corners)  will  almost
         always be monitored by the local police even if it is not  stopped.
         The private  evangelism  (versus  the  deliberate  presentation  to
         another person of the Christian's faith through word  and/or  deed)
         can itself be risky if undercover police have threatened individual
         Christians (for whatever reason) and persuaded them  to  report  on
         their Christian brethren.  'Divide and conquer' is a common  tactic
         in the exercise of China's political and  social  power.   Official
         pressure against a particular 'unregistered' Christian or Christian
         group can cause another 'unregistered' or  'registered'  Christians
         to keep their distance or to be  more  intentional  in  cooperating
         with the authorities. ... The size  and  social  reach  of  China's
         'unregistered' churches  suggests,  however,  that  either  through
         Christian passion and evangelistic skill, or  political  ineptitude
         and/or toleration, the church  has  generally  weathered  well  the
         unpredictable storms of opposition and flourished.'

12. In his report, Dr Hancock set out  two  factors  which  may  have  some
    significant bearing  upon  the  present  attitude  of  the  authorities
    towards religion in general and Christianity in particular:

      1)  Rapid growth in Christianity.     Between  2009  and  2012,  there
         were  three  government-sponsored  surveys  of  religion  in  China
         (including the annual Blue Book on religion produced by  the  world
         religion section of the Chinese Academy of Science), which revealed
         that the  number  of  Christians  far  exceeded  previous  official
         estimates.

         The concept of 'registration' was put under  review  and  overtures
         were made to 'unregistered' churches and church leaders to meet and
         accept  an  amnesty  or  alternative  form  of  registration.   The
         intention was to circumvent the system  managed  by  the  religious
         affairs  bureau  (SARA).   Tension   mounted   between   government
         departments and the TSPM/CCC leadership who had  consistently  been
         resistant to any Christian activity or theological  teaching  which
         they had not controlled or accredited.  Accordingly, as reported in
         the United States Commission  on  International  Religious  Freedom
         (USCIRF) Annual Report 2012, SARA appears to have won  the  behind-
         the-scenes battle and reasserted their right to control and monitor
         religious activity in China.  In consequence, since 2012 'risks  to
         'unregistered'  Christian  congregations  of  potentially   hostile
         activity  by  the  government   and   religious   authorities   has
         increased'.

         There  had  been  widely-publicised  trials  of  strength   between
         religion and state, particularly of the Shouwang Church in Beijing,
         which had been subject to official intimidation and  disruption  of
         services for  a  number  of  years.   There  has  been  much  media
         attention on the Shouwang affair.

         The facts appeared to be as follows:  in 2009 Shouwang paid for the
         second floor of a building to be used as a church.  The authorities
         interfered to prevent  the  church  from  using  the  building,  by
         pressuring the property developer to  hand  over  the  key  to  the
         church.  Since then, tension between the government and the  church
         leaders and members has mounted.  Having  been  excluded  from  its
         buildings, the church ignored police  instructions  and  met  in  a
         local park for more than  six  months.   Members  of  the  church's
         governing committee, two pastors and three elders, and other  major
         co-workers have been under house arrest for all or much of the time
         since April 2011.  The evidence was that other  church  members  in
         Beijing, from Shouwang and other churches, had  been  detained  for
         between a few hours and two days.

    (2)  Religious tensions.   From 2010 -  2011,  the  Chinese  government
         experienced  a  number  of  problems  associated   with   religious
         communities.  This included the violent Muslim unrest in  Xianjiang
         province,  and  a  growing  number  of   radical   Buddhist   self-
         immolations.  Having been considered a 'social group', the  Chinese
         authorities' perceptions about religion had developed, and religion
         in general, but Buddhism and Islam in particular, were now regarded
         as a potentially dangerous political aberration.

         This  revised  assessment  of  religion  and  the  tense  situation
         surrounding religious activity as a whole in China remained.  There
         was closer monitoring of  Chinese  society  and  dissenting  groups
         within it, associated with a recent change in political leadership.
          The re-emergence of the military at the heart of China's political
         process was not a ground for hope to a return of the liberalism  of
         previous years.

13. Dr Hancock went on to say as follows:-

         'Like many commentators, I believe China's long game  is  personal,
         political  and  social  liberalisation:  paradoxically,   religious
         groups with strong political instincts and a  will  to  provoke  or
         proclaim their 'freedom' may be among the  greatest  hindrances  to
         that liberalisation process.'

    He commented that recent events had,  for  the  time  being,  increased
    tension between the Chinese authorities and religious communities.

14. Dr Hancock noted that so far as  not  all  Christians  in  unregistered
    churches are equally at risk.  It remains possible for an  unregistered
    Chinese Christian to worship without risk or fear, despite  technically
    acting illegally.  Gatherings of less than 10 to 25 in many  areas  are
    unknown, ignored or reluctantly tolerated.   But  unregistered  Chinese
    Christians who consistently and publicly  take  risks  by  questioning,
    resisting  or  publicly  defying  central  or  local   injunctions   on
    Christians, meetings, publications and so on,  in  his  opinion  expose
    themselves to possible censure, intimidation, detention, physical abuse
    and house arrest or imprisonment.  This is as true in rural settings as
    in urban areas.  Public evangelism and active proselytising may attract
    particular attention in opposition, especially if this is  reckoned  to
    contribute to local social instability.

15. Dr Hancock commented in his report:-

         'Though some 'unregistered' churches respond to  official  pressure
         by flaunting guidelines and promoting government  hostility  others
         have faithfully melted into the web and waft of a  local  community
         to  await  a  more  conducive  political   atmosphere.    In   some
         'unregistered' churches' 'secrecy' is  cherished  as  a  particular
         virtue, in others excessive 'privacy' in  matters  of  faith  is  a
         vice; for them faith and public witness go hand in hand.  There  is
         no one principle that united China's 'unregistered' churches;  both
         in nature and in definition, in China's  'family  churches'  shared
         principles are as uncommon as shared leaders.'

16. Dr Hancock has stressed that China continues to experience one  of  the
    most significant internal population migrations that the world has ever
    seen.  In the last ten years or so some 300,000  million  Chinese  have
    migrated to  China's  cities.   Bureaucratic  systems  to  monitor  and
    control this process have struggled to keep pace with it.  Among  those
    migrating from rural communities to the  cities  are  many  of  China's
    Christians:  the  size  of  China's  urban  migrant  churches  -   some
    associated  with  particular  minority  communities  and  social   care
    programs - is only explained in part by the arrival of Christians  from
    rural areas.  Many migrants find community and  identity  in  new  ways
    from Christian associations in their cities.

17. Dr Hancock comments that an unregistered Christian will not necessarily
    be closely tracked from place to  place  in  China,  unless  they  have
    gained a particular notoriety or have been blacklisted by the  security
    services.  The  Christian  will,  as  always,  have  to  make  personal
    decisions about the degree to which they practise  their  faith  openly
    and deliberately provoke the authorities. Not  all  Chinese  Christians
    agree that certain forms of open Christian living  and  witnessing  are
    necessary adjuncts of Christian faithfulness and/or obedience.  Indeed,
    there is also variance in the patterns to which  the  authorities  will
    respond to such openness.  Some authorities will be less  efficient  in
    monitoring and controlling or more tolerant.

18. Thus, as Dr Hancock finally concludes, China is  an  intensely  complex
    place, as is the monitoring or predicting of official attitudes towards
    religion.  Simplification is a natural temptation and exaggeration  too
    easy.  A Christian who openly and provocatively engages in public  acts
    of  worship,  evangelism,  publishing,  protest  or   litigation   will
    generally attract  the  attention  of  the  officials  and  may  suffer
    censure, threat, violence or detention.  However, Dr Hancock concludes:

         '...the   Chinese's    government    permissive    acceptance    of
         'unregistered'  churches  continues.   Christians  themselves  have
         power to limit or increase risk in line with  their  perception  of
         obedient faith and government power.  Not  all  Chinese  Christians
         agree to interpret official dictates  as  requiring  conformity  or
         repudiation.   Some  Chinese  Christians  continue   to   interpret
         faithfulness to God as acceptance of the limitations imposed by the
         divinely sanctioned state authority; others question the legitimacy
         of an atheistic state to control, interpret or restrict the actions
         of churches or  individual  Christians.   Evaluating  the  relative
         truth of these  claims  and  resolving  anomalies  in  accounts  of
         Christianity in China, is a subtle and perplexing task.'

parentheses since ChinaAid does not, it seems, analyse  its  data  according
to  the  autonomous  international  meaning  of  that  term.   Rather,   any
interference  with  services,  church  buildings,  or   worship   generally,
whatever its level of severity, is treated as 'persecution'.
[3] The report does not make it clear whether the figures of those  detained
are included in the numbers 'persecuted',  but  it  seems  likely  that  the
'persecution' figure is a cumulative total of those detained and  those  who
were otherwise affected by the actions of the authorities.

denote 'abuse'.
