                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appeal against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Ferguson (the judge) promulgated on 4th July 2014.

 2. The Appellants are nationals  of  Bangladesh.   The  first  and  second
    Appellant born 13th October 1986 and 5th October 1986 respectively  are
    husband and wife and are the parents of the third Appellant  born  14th
    September 2012.

 3. The first Appellant applied for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system  (PBS)
    and the second and third Appellants applied for leave to remain as  his
    dependants.

 4. The applications were  refused  on  24th  September  2013.   The  first
    Appellant's application was refused with  reference  to  paragraph  46-
    SD(c)(iii) as evidence had not been produced to prove that the business
    is subject to UK taxation.  The first  Appellant  therefore  failed  to
    satisfy the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules,  and  because  his
    application was  refused,  the  applications  of  his  dependants  were
    refused in line.

 5. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  and  their  appeals
    were heard together by the judge on 21st May 2014 and  dismissed.   The
    judge found that the first Appellant's application  could  not  satisfy
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules for the reasons given by  the
    Respondent in refusing the application,  and  rejected  the  contention
    that the Respondent should have considered evidential flexibility.  The
    judge considered the family and private lives  of  the  Appellants  and
    rejected the appeals on those grounds.

 6. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.
    In summary it was contended that the judge  had  erred  by  misapplying
    sections 85 and 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    (the 2002 Act),  and  had  made  his  decision  "in  disregard  of  the
    principles of burden of proof".  It was also contended that  the  judge
    had not given  appropriate  weight  to  documents,  and  had  blatantly
    disregarded the Appellants' human rights.

 7. It was further submitted that the judge had failed to have  due  regard
    to the evidential flexibility policy which existed in PBS cases.

 8. It was contended that the first Appellant satisfied the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules, and that the judge in dismissing the appeal  did
    not "apply the principles of burden of proof which was on the SSHD."

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Keane who recorded;

         "Broadly, the grounds amounted to no more than a disagreement  with
         the findings of the judge.  However, in paragraph 8 of the grounds,
         the author arguably contended that the judge had not borne in  mind
         the burden of proof and had not applied the requisite  standard  of
         proof.  Nowhere in his determination  did  the  judge  mention  the
         burden and standard of proof and his  failure  to  do  so  arguably
         amounted to an error of law  but  for  which  the  outcome  of  the
         appeals might have been different.  The applications for permission
         are granted."

10. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of the  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 contending that it was common  ground  between  the  parties
    before the  judge,  that  the  first  Appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  and  failing  to  mention  the
    burden and standard of proof did not amount to a material error of law.



11. The Tribunal issued directions that there should be  a  hearing  before
    the  Upper  Tribunal  to  decide  whether   the   First-tier   Tribunal
    determination should be set aside.

The Appellants' Submissions

12. Mr Bhuiyan had not appeared before the First-tier Tribunal as his  firm
    were not instructed in those proceedings, but relied upon  the  grounds
    contained within the application for permission to appeal.  Mr  Bhuiyan
    accepted that the appeal could not have succeeded under the Immigration
    Rules because the specified evidence in relation to  taxation  had  not
    been submitted.

13. He, however, argued that the first Appellant had  invested  ï¿½50,000  in
    the business, and it would be disproportionate if he had to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.  I was therefore asked to find that the judge  had  not
    adequately considered Article 8, and Mr Bhuiyan pointed  out  that  the
    judge had not made a finding as to  whether  the  first  Appellant  was
    credible, and had not made any reference to the length of time that the
    first Appellant had been in the United Kingdom, and he had entered this
    country in 2006.

14. It was also contended that the judge had failed to  adequately  explain
    why the evidential flexibility policy could not be considered.

15. I was asked to find that the judge had failed to set out and apply  the
    correct standard and burden of proof.

The Respondent's Submissions

16. Mr Mills submitted that much of what Mr Bhuiyan had contended  was  not
    relevant to the grant of permission by  Judge  Keane,  which  indicated
    that the grounds amounted to a disagreement with the findings  made  by
    the judge, although failing to mention the burden and standard of proof
    was an arguable error of law.

17. Mr Mills pointed  out  that  it  was  accepted  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the Immigration Rules could not be satisfied and that the
    judge had considered paragraph 245AA and concluded that  this  did  not
    assist the Appellants and had not erred in so doing.

18. I was asked to accept that it was not clear how setting out the  burden
    and standard of proof would have made any difference to the decision in
    this case.

19. In relation to Article  8,  Mr  Mills  contended  that  the  judge  had
    properly and adequately considered all that was relevant  and  had  not
    erred in law.

The Appellants' Response

20. Mr Bhuiyan agreed  that  permission  was  limited  to  the  burden  and
    standard of proof issue, but contended that this was  relevant  to  the
    judge's overall consideration of the appeals.  I was  asked  to  accept
    that the judge had not considered all relevant factors in  relation  to
    Article 8, such as the length of time that the first Appellant had been
    in the United Kingdom, and therefore the determination was  flawed  and
    should be set aside.

21. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

22. I do not find any merit in the grounds contained within the application
    for permission to appeal, and I do not find that the judge erred in law
    for the following reasons.

23. Failing to set out a self-direction regarding the burden  and  standard
    of proof does not without more amount to an error of law.   I  find  no
    evidence within the determination that  the  judge  applied  the  wrong
    burden or standard of proof.

24. It is apparent that it was common ground between  the  parties,  before
    the judge, (see paragraphs 7 and 10) that a specified document was  not
    provided with the application.  This  was  the  reason  why  the  first
    Appellant's application was refused, as the requirements  of  paragraph
    46-SD(c)(iii) were not satisfied.  The specified evidence  required  to
    prove that the business is subject to United Kingdom taxation  had  not
    been provided.   The  application  of  section  85A  of  the  2002  Act
    prevented the submission of the missing specified  evidence  after  the
    application had been lodged.

25. It was therefore argued that evidential flexibility  should  have  been
    considered by the Respondent.  The judge considered  this  argument  at
    paragraphs 11 and 12 of the determination and  decided  that  paragraph
    245AA(c) did not impose an obligation on the Respondent to contact  the
    first Appellant because he had failed to submit  a  specified  document
    with his application.  That finding was clearly open to  the  judge  to
    make, and discloses no error of law.

26. Dealing with Article 8, the judge noted that it was accepted  that  the
    requirements of Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules could not be satisfied.  The judge went on to consider Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules, and took into account the relevant  case
    law.  It was not necessary for the judge to make a specific credibility
    finding in relation to the first Appellant, as there  appears  to  have
    been no issue in relation to his credibility, and the judge dealt  with
    the appeals on the first Appellant's own account.  It is  incorrect  to
    say that the judge did not take into account the length  of  time  that
    the first Appellant has been in the United Kingdom, as the judge in his
    first paragraph set out that the first Appellant had entered the United
    Kingdom in September 2006 as a student.

27. The conclusion reached by the judge that the Respondent's decisions did
    not amount to a disproportionate breach of the family or private  lives
    of the Appellants is a conclusion open to him on the evidence, and  the
    judge has given sustainable reasons for reaching that decision, and has
    not erred in law.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal discloses no error of law.

I do not set aside the decision, and the appeals are dismissed.

Anonymity

No order for anonymity was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.
