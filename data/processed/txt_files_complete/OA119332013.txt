Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. On 23rd June 2014 Designated Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Zucker
    gave permission to the appellant to appeal against the determination of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Devlin who  dismissed  the  appeal  on
    immigration and human  rights  grounds  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent on 16th May 2013 to refuse  entry  clearance  as  a  partner
    under the provisions of Appendix FM and FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.



 2. In granting permission Designated Judge Zucker noted that, in  essence,
    the grounds argued that the judge clearly disagreed with  the  decision
    of Blake J in R (MM) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 and allowed his  views  of
    that judgment to unfairly effect his determination of the issues he had
    to resolve.  Although Designated Judge Zucker noted that  Judge  Devlin
    indicated (paragraph 102) that, despite his views, he would follow  the
    reasoning of Blake J it was arguable that the judge had failed to  give
    sufficient weight to the factors  identified  in  the  judgment  which,
    unless and until reversed on appeal, would arguably to have been given.



 3. At the time this matter came before me the judgment of Blake J had been
    overturned by the decision of the Court of Appeal in MM and  Others,  R
    (On the application of) v SHHD [2014] EWCA Civ  985.   In  summary  the
    Court of Appeal held that  the  new  maintenance  requirements  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  which  the  judgment  of  Blake  J  had  sought  to
    ameliorate were created  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  were  not
    inherently disproportionate or unfair.  It was not the Court's  job  to
    impose its own views of the new minimum income requirements created  in
    accordance with the law and it was not correct to conclude  that  those
    income requirements were, in principle, incapable of  being  compatible
    with Article 8 rights of UK partners.

 4. At paragraph 129 of their judgement  the  Court  of  Appeal  also  made
    reference to the conclusions of the High Court in R (On the application
    of) Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) by concluding that there was not much
    utility in imposing a further, intermediary, test before considering  a
    further Article 8 claim where the particular requirements of the  Rules
    could not be fulfilled.  This conclusion undermined the decision of the
    Upper Tribunal in Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules  -  correct  approach)
    [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).

 5. Before me, Ms Lee argued (with  reference  to  her  skeleton  argument)
    that, despite the decision in MM which she agreed was broadly  in  line
    with Judge Devlin's views of the decision of Blake J, the determination
    did not show that the judge had given sufficient weight to the  factors
    relevant to the Article 8 balancing  act.  This  was  even  though  she
    conceded that the sponsor could not show  that  he  had  the  requisite
    �18,600 annual income required for a couple under the Rules.

 6. Ms  Johnstone  argued  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  had  endorsed  the
    application of the �18,600 maintenance minimum requirement and, in that
    respect, the Rules were a complete code.  She also pointed out that, as
    the decision had to be made on the circumstances  appertaining  at  the
    time of the respondent's decision on 16th  May  2013,  the  prospective
    future earnings and savings claimed by the sponsor could not  be  taken
    into consideration.

Conclusions

 7. The First-tier Judge's determination is  comprehensive.   He  correctly
    (at the time) referred to the decision  of  Blake  J  in  MM  and  also
    Gulshan setting out his own views for disagreeing with the  conclusions
    of Blake J which he nevertheless treated with the highest  of  respect.
    However, the judge stated in paragraph 60 that he would,  nevertheless,
    follow the guidance contained in both Blake J's judgment and Gulshan as
    he was required to do.  The issues for me to consider  are,  therefore,
    whether the judge's approach, now, gives rise to a material error on  a
    point of law and whether his subsequent consideration of  human  rights
    issues outside the Immigration Rules also indicates such an error.

 8. If the judgment of Blake J had been supported by the Court of Appeal in
    MM  then  there  might  have  been  strong  merit  in  the  grounds  of
    application on the basis that Judge Devlin had  expressed  disagreement
    with guidance which he was bound to apply.  But any such  concerns  are
    effectively neutralised by the Court of Appeal's decision in  MM  which
    requires that the minimum financial  limit  set  out  in  paragraph  E-
    LTRP.3.1 of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules is to be met.   It  is
    also  evident,  from  paragraph   61   of   the   determination,   that
    representatives had conceded that the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    financial requirements set out in the Rules.  Thus, the judge  was  not
    wrong to dismiss the appeal on immigration grounds.

 9. The judge then found (paragraph 65)  that,  if  it  were  not  for  the
    judgment of Blake  J  and  the  determination  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Gulshan, he would have found that the appellant had failed to establish
    a good arguable case for consideration of Article 8 issues outside  the
    Rules.  Although that approach  is  now  wrong  having  regard  to  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in MM, the judge's actual consideration
    of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules is in line with the decision
    of the Court of Appeal.  Thus, the judge's approach to Article 8 issues
    is not, I conclude, wrong in a material respect.

10. However, in  considering  Article  8  issues,  the  judge  reverted  to
    consideration to the  judgment  of  Blake  J  (paragraph  76  onwards).
    Nevertheless, for the cogently  reasoned  arguments  put  forward  from
    paragraph 76 to paragraph 102 of the determination, the  judge  reached
    the conclusion, then open to  him,  that  the  application  of  �18,600
    requirement in Appendix FM to the appellant  was  not  disproportionate
    despite the guidance of Blake J.  In summary  the  judge  identified  a
    shortfall of �3,145.66 in the sponsor's  gross  income  in  the  twelve
    months prior to the date of application which, for the  reasons  given,
    he was entitled to conclude was not made up by the prospect  of  future
    earnings (which could not in any event be taken into consideration)  or
    savings. The total figure still came below the �18,600 minimum  in  the
    Rules.  Although such a second analysis of the parties' ability to meet
    the minimum amount required under the Rules  is  now  unnecessary  that
    does not mean that the judge's  decision  was  materially  wrong.   His
    analysis made it doubly clear that  the  parties  could  not  meet  the
    minimum income requirements.

11. However, the judge did not leave his analysis of Article  8  issues  at
    that point.  From paragraph 107 onwards  he  considered  other  factors
    relating to the circumstances of the parties, particularly those of the
    sponsor, before reaching the conclusion that the respondent's  decision
    was not disproportionate.  These are the factors  which,  according  to
    the grounds of application, the judge failed to give sufficient  weight
    to.  However, the determination makes it clear that the judge  did  not
    gloss over the sponsor's age, nationality or state of health  and  gave
    consideration to whether or not it would be reasonable  to  expect  the
    sponsor to move to Thailand to maintain his  family  life.   The  judge
    carefully balanced the relevant factors against the public interest  in
    legitimate immigration control noting that the sponsor had  decided  to
    marry the appellant at a time when  he  knew  he  could  not  meet  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM  and  could  have  no  legitimate
    expectation that his wife would be admitted to UK.

12. In all the circumstances I have reached the  conclusion  that,  despite
    the change in approach to an Article 8  claim  required  following  the
    Court of Appeal decision in MM, the determination does  not  show  that
    the judge made a material error on a point of law.  It can be said that
    he reached a conclusion about proportionality  under  Article  8  which
    would have been the same even if he had been aware  of  the  change  of
    approach to consideration of such issues.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error on a point of law and shall stand.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order nor  do  I  consider
that it is appropriate to make one in the Upper  Tribunal  bearing  in  mind
the circumstances of this appeal  and  the  fact  that  no  such  order  was
requested by representatives.
