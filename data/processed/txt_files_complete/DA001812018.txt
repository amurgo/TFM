For the Appellant:     Mr S Joseph, Counsel instructed by Turpin & Miller
                    LLP
For the Respondent:    Ms S Rushforth, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the continuation of an appeal by the Appellant  against  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge C J Woolley) in which the
       Judge dismissed the appeal of the  Appellant,  a  citizen  of  Iraq,
       against the Secretary of State's  decision  to  make  a  deportation
       order  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2016  (SI
       2016/1052).

    2. At a hearing on 26 April 2019 the Vice President and Upper  Tribunal
       Judge Grubb decided that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law  in
       dismissing the appeal and set aside the decision of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal to be remade by the Upper Tribunal.

    3. The primary reason that the decision was set aside was because,  due
       to a factual error, the Judge  found  that  the  Appellant  had  not
       acquired a permanent right of residence and therefore  that  serious
       grounds of public policy or public security  were  not  required  to
       justify his deportation. It is now accepted that the  Appellant  has
       resided in the United  Kingdom  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
       national for more than five years and so by virtue of Regulation  15
       of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  has
       acquired a permanent  right  of  residence  and  therefore  that  in
       accordance with Regulation 27(3) "serious grounds of  public  policy
       or public security" are required to justify his removal.

    4. At the  resumed  hearing  before  us  Mr  Joseph  appeared  for  the
       Appellant and submitted a supplementary bundle containing 61  pages.
       Ms Rushforth represented the Secretary of State and did  not  submit
       any additional documents.



Oral Evidence

    5. The Appellant  gave  oral  evidence  and  adopted  his  two  witness
       statements. Cross-examined and referred to the OASys  assessment  in
       the Appellant's bundle he said that he  had  changed  his  life  not
       because of this appeal but for himself, his son and his  family.  He
       said that he does not take drugs and that he now only drinks alcohol
       occasionally with his foster parents. He denied drifting back to the
       kind of people he associated with before and said that they  are  in
       prison. Referred to previous incidents of threatening behaviour  and
       damaging his ex-partner's car,  the  Appellant  said  this  occurred
       before  he  went  to  prison  and  he  received  community   service
       sentences. So far as the index offence was concerned, he  said  that
       he made no money, pleaded guilty  immediately  and  got  the  lowest
       sentence. He denied that his pattern of behaviour suggested that  he
       will commit further offences.

    6. The Appellant said that he sees his son, [Z], at  least  three  days
       per week and he stays over with the Appellant. He takes him  to  and
       from school. Contact is not prearranged; it changes  every  week  by
       agreement with his former wife. He said that his son visited him  in
       prison, but he did not want him to see him there, he got his  foster
       parents to bring him every couple of months. Otherwise he maintained
       contact by telephone. His son has family  members  on  his  mother's
       side and the Appellant's foster carers have a lot  of  contact  with
       him. He said that they have done more for him than his own  parents.
       The Appellant said that  he  works  intermittently  at  a  car  wash
       dependent on the weather. He supports his son financially by  taking
       him shopping and buying meals. There is no regular payment.

    7. [AH] (his former foster parent) gave evidence and  adopted  her  two
       written witness statements. In cross-examination she said  that  she
       sees the Appellant once or twice a week depending on whether [Z]  is
       with him. The Appellant sees [Z] at least  once  per  week  and  [Z]
       stays overnight with him. His mother contacts the Appellant  or  the
       witness if she can't pick up [Z] from school. She  agreed  that  she
       took [Z] to see the Appellant in prison about three times.



Submissions

    8. For the Respondent Ms Rushforth relied on the  reasons  for  refusal
       letter of 9 March 2018. Paragraph 37 of  that  letter  asserts  that
       even if the Appellant had permanent residence  the  requirement  for
       serious grounds of public  policy  would  be  satisfied.  The  index
       offence of conspiracy to supply a controlled class A  drug  resulted
       in a sentence of two years and four months. There is  a  history  of
       offending and an increase in  seriousness.  The  Respondent  submits
       that the Appellant poses a present genuine and sufficiently  serious
       threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. Such a
       threat does not need to be  imminent  or  identified.  Ms  Rushforth
       referred to the OASys report at page 36 where it is said that he  is
       a person who tries to shift the blame and  to  give  the  impression
       that he was complying with supervision because it will help him.  It
       is accepted that he has not been convicted of any offence since  his
       release just over a year ago but his  immigration  appeal  has  been
       pending. The index offence resulted in a sentence of more  than  two
       years imprisonment and so was  particularly  serious.  There  is  no
       evidence that he undertook any courses in prison. The OASys  report,
       compiled a year ago, said that he does not drink but now  he  admits
       to the occasional drink. This could indicate  that  he  is  slipping
       back into bad behaviour. Ms Rushforth said that the Appellant is  28
       years old and is in fairly regular contact with  his  eight-year-old
       son.  Whereas  this  would  cease  if  he  were  deported,   it   is
       proportionate to the threat. The  child  has  her  mother  plus  her
       mother's family and the Appellant's foster carers.

    9. For the Appellant Mr Joseph said that it was now accepted  that  the
       Appellant had acquired permanent residence in the United Kingdom. He
       is socially and culturally integrated and the index offence,  whilst
       serious, does not suggest  that  he  poses  a  genuine  present  and
       sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the   fundamental
       interests of society or that there are  serious  grounds  of  public
       policy or public security requiring his removal. The comments in the
       current OASys report are copied over from a previous  OASys  report.
       There is no escalation in the seriousness of offending because there
       are no relevant previous convictions. We were referred to  paragraph
       10 and 11 of the Court of Appeal's judgement when his  sentence  was
       reduced. This suggests that he was a vulnerable and exploited street
       dealer. The OASys report at page 49 shows  risk  of  reoffending  as
       low. It is difficult to see in these circumstances  how  he  can  be
       said to pose a threat.

   10. We reserved our decision.



Discussion

   11. The Appellant is a 28-year-old Iraqi  citizen  who  arrived  in  the
       United Kingdom in 2008 as a 16-year-old minor,  asylum  seeker.  His
       asylum claim was refused but he was granted discretionary  leave  to
       remain. As a minor the Appellant went to live with a foster  family,
       Mr and Mrs [H] and he still  maintains  a  close  relationship  with
       them. In 2009, after his discretionary leave had expired, he met and
       began a relationship with a Portuguese  national.  The  couple  were
       married in 2011 and their son, [Z], was born on 3 November 2012. The
       Appellant was issued with a residence card as the spouse of  an  EEA
       national exercising Treaty rights in 2012. The relationship with his
       wife finished at the end of 2014.  The  Appellant's  residence  card
       expired on 17 November 2016.

   12. On 3 August 2016 the Appellant was arrested for conspiracy to supply
       a class A drug and on 20 March 2017 he was convicted of the  offence
       and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment (reduced to 2 years  4  months
       on appeal). He was released from detention on 19 June 2018. This was
       not the Appellant's first offence. The Home Office decision  records
       (at paragraph 89) offences of possession of  class  A  and  class  B
       drugs, an offence of harassment without violence and one of  failing
       to comply with the requirements of a community order. These offences
       were dealt with by way of cautions,  community  order  and  a  small
       fine. The Appellant has not been convicted of any offences following
       his release from detention.

   13. The Respondent asserts that the Appellant poses  a  genuine  present
       and sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the  public  to  justify  his
       deportation on serious grounds of public policy.  In  assessing  the
       nature  and  seriousness  of  this  threat  the  Respondent   places
       significant weight on the sentencing remarks of the Trial Judge  and
       the Appellant's previous  offending.  Having  established  that  the
       Appellant has a  permanent  right  of  residence  Ms  Rushforth  now
       suggests that  the  OASys  report  indicates  that  serious  grounds
       remain. In our judgement both the sentencing remarks and  the  OASys
       report merit some analysis.

   14. In the refusal letter the Respondent, at paragraph 28,  quotes  from
       the remarks of the sentencing judge as follows

    "Each one of you, coming to this country as  a  foreign  national,  has
    chosen to abuse the hospitality, freedom and opportunity  this  country
    has offered you, by turning to the supply to the  community  of  drugs.
    Those drugs are, by their  nature,  destructive  of  family,  life  and
    ambition. Those things underpin the very community that has offered you
    that haven

    ...

    Mr Samir [J], single count, count 23 on this indictment. I see in  your
    case no reason  to  move  one  way  or  the  other  of  category  three
    significant role. It is significant because one sees the nature of  the
    transactions  when  you  are  involved  on  five  occasions   supplying
    undercover officers with cocaine. "

   15. The refusal letter does not however  mention  the  judgement  of  Mr
       Justice King given when the Appellant appealed against his sentence.
       Paragraph 10 reads as follows

    "Mr Hopper (the Appellant's counsel) has identified in  particular  the
    following features of the mitigation to such  reduced  starting  point:
    there were no relevant previous convictions; the evidence  showed  that
    the Appellant was a vulnerable young man  who  had  been  exploited  by
    others in the conspiracy; at the time of the offences, he was  homeless
    and a drug addict himself; and he had given an account to the police in
    interview in which he had explained his role and had stated that he was
    paid �5 to supply the drug, or given food and  shelter  in  return.  Mr
    Hopper further submitted that, on the evidence, the Appellant's role in
    the conspiracy had been limited; he had no  influence  on  any  of  the
    other co-defendants; and he had little understanding of  the  scale  of
    the criminal  enterprise.  There  was  positive  mitigation  which  had
    emerged from his time in custody. He had fully engaged with the  prison
    authorities, had undertaken numerous courses and classes, and indeed  a
    large number of certificates had  been  handed  up  to  the  sentencing
    court."

   16. Mr Justice King concludes that

    "the Appellant had no relevant convictions, and, in  truth,  he  was  a
    vulnerable and exploited street dealer at low-level for little reward"

   17. In our judgement the difference in emphasis between  the  sentencing
       remarks and the Court of Appeal judgement  is  significant.  In  the
       one, which underlies the Respondent's reasons for deciding that  the
       Appellant poses a present, genuine and serious threat, the Appellant
       is portrayed as equal in blameworthiness to his co-defendants. He is
       described as an ungrateful individual abusing the  hospitality  that
       he has been shown. In the other, one that corrects the first, he  is
       portrayed as a victim  of  his  co-defendants  both  vulnerable  and
       exploited. It is perhaps also  appropriate  to  point  out  that  Ms
       Rushforth's comment  in  submissions  that  the  Appellant  has  not
       undertaken any courses in prison is shown to be wrong by  the  Court
       of Appeal decision noting that he had undertaken numerous course and
       classes. Indeed, the Respondent's supplementary refusal letter of 19
       September  2018  acknowledges  and  lists  at   paragraph   12   the
       certificates provided in respect of courses attended. The  paragraph
       concludes  that   insufficient   time   has   passed   to   evidence
       rehabilitation, that no  evidence  has  been  provide  that  he  has
       distanced himself from his accomplices and that no evidence has been
       provide that he is financially self-sufficient. In fact, more than a
       year has now passed since the Appellant's  release  from  detention,
       and there is no evidence put forward to suggest that  he  associates
       with anyone untoward (see further below) and for the last  year  the
       evidence shows that he has been working.

   18. Turning to the OASys assessment Ms Rushforth pointed  in  particular
       to paragraph 12.8 of the assessment dated 17 June  2019.  Under  the
       heading "Motivation  to  address  offending  behaviour"  the  author
       suggests

    "Mr [J], at the moment, appears to be law-abiding, however his  history
    suggests otherwise. Although he has two convictions, the index  offence
    was  committed  along  with  a  number  of  other  men,  from  his  own
    background, albeit he was not found guilty of the other offences on the
    charge sheet. Mr [J] works with men from his own ethnic group  and  I'm
    not convinced, that given the opportunity, he would not return  to  his
    previous life ...

    Mr [J] functions in society at a  level  that  is  acceptable,  on  the
    surface. He appreciates that he did wrong  and  should  have  sanctions
    applied. He does minimise his own actions over the offences  for  which
    he has been convicted. I'm not convinced that  if  the  same  situation
    occurred he would not follow the  same  path  with  the  same  outcome.
    According to the police, the people who Mr  [J]  works  and  socialises
    with are in the same subculture as his co-defendants, and he  needs  to
    recognise is to move away from his past in a positive manner ...

    Mr [J] seems to be motivated to leave the  past  behind  him.  He  does
    appear to  have  drifted  back  to  the  type  of  people  who  he  was
    associating with when he committed his index  offence.  This  does  not
    convince me that he really wants to change. If he did he would  try  to
    meet people who are from a different background from his past.  He  may
    be taking a short-term view until the outcome of his  appeal  is  known
    but I would consider moving away from the people who remix  within  the
    past, would be a more  positive  course  to  follow  than  the  one  he
    presently pursues."

   19. We find some difficulty  with  this  report.  In  the  first  place,
       despite being dated 17 June 2019 it is, apart from the correction of
       some of the typographical errors, an exact copy  of  the  assessment
       from 19 July 2018. The comments suggesting that the Appellant  seeks
       to minimise his own actions do not seem to take any account  of  the
       Court of Appeal judgement which gives justification for  this  view.
       Further we cannot avoid noting that the sentiments expressed in  the
       assessment are,  to  say  the  least,  unfortunate  referring  in  a
       detrimental way to persons of the Appellant's "own background", "own
       ethnic group" and "same subculture".

   20. Mr Joseph rightly pointed out that the particularly relevant part of
       the OASys assessments is to be found in the risk of reoffending.  In
       both versions of the assessment this is shown as low.



Decision

   21. It really is not necessary for us to take matters much  further.  In
       our judgement when we combine the decision of the  Court  of  Appeal
       which shows no relevant previous convictions by  a  man  who  was  a
       vulnerable and exploited street  dealer  with  an  OASys  assessment
       which records a low risk of reoffending, it is impossible for us  to
       find that the Appellant poses a  genuine  present  and  sufficiently
       serious threat to the public to justify his deportation  on  serious
       grounds of public policy.  When  we  add  to  this  the  Appellant's
       relationship with his son, his relationship with and the support  he
       receives from his former foster carers, his employment and his clean
       record since release from detention we are satisfied that there  are
       no serious grounds of public policy to justify his  deportation  and
       therefore that his appeal must be allowed.



Conclusion

   22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the  making  of  a
       material error of law and has been set aside.

   23. We remake the decision and we allow the Appellant's appeal under the
       Immigration (EEA) Regulations against the Respondent's  decision  to
       make a deportation order.
