For the Appellant:     Mr J Howard of Fountain Solicitors (Walsall)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan.  She appealed to  a  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal against the Secretary of State's decision on 18
    February 2019 to make a deportation order.

2.   The appellant was born  in  1969  in  Pakistan  and  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.  She claims to have come to the United Kingdom some 30  years
    ago, and she came unlawfully using  a  British  passport  and  a  false
    identity.  Her three adult children are British  citizens  as  are  her
    grandchildren.

3.   The appellant pleaded guilty at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 28  February
    2018 to using a false instrument, the false passport, with intent.  She
    was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for that offence and this  led
    to the decision to make the deportation order against her.

4.   The judge noted that the appellant, being  a  widow,  cannot  meet  the
    requirements  of  paragraph  399(b)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    evidence did not show that  she  could  be  said  to  have  a  parental
    relationship with any of her grandchildren, and her  children  are  all
    adults.   In  the  circumstances  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 399(a).

5.   To succeed under the Immigration Rules, the judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant would have to show that she met the provisions  of  paragraph
    399A.  The requirements of this paragraph are cumulative.

6.   On the basis of the  appellant's  claim  to  have  entered  the  United
    Kingdom in approximately 1994, she has been in the United  Kingdom  for
    25 years.  However she has not been in the United Kingdom for  most  of
    her life let alone lawfully, since she was born in 1969.

7.   Paragraph 399A(b) requires that the appellant should  be  socially  and
    culturally integrated into  the  United  Kingdom  and  under  paragraph
    399A(c)  that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   her
    integration into the country to which she would be deported.  The judge
    noted that although she could not meet the terms of paragraph 399A, her
    circumstances and ability to meet these parts of the Rules was relevant
    as it informed an assessment as to whether there were "very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described" in  paragraph  399A  that
    would justify allowing the appeal.

8.   The judge noted the appellant's guilty plea and although the  judge  in
    his trial had accepted that her sister and husband  were  involved  and
    she might not have had much say in events, it was clear  that  she  was
    sentenced on the basis that she knew from the outset what was going  on
    with regard to the use of the stolen British identity.  The  judge  had
    noted that the appellant had little involvement with mainstream British
    society looking after the home and  family,  but  after  her  husband's
    death in 2008 she had control of her circumstances and she had declined
    to have a trial of the issue as to whether she was under the  influence
    of other males of  the  family.   Using  the  false  identity  she  had
    obtained over ï¿½176,000 in  benefits  of  various  kinds.   Her  actions
    involved repeated false statements to the benefits system.

9.   The judge noted that her witness statement placed  the  blame  squarely
    on her late husband and protested complete ignorance of any wrong doing
    and that applied also to her continuing to claim benefits following his
    death.  At paragraph 17 of her statement she said she was not aware she
    had committed any fraud but at paragraph 19 she accepted responsibility
    for her actions.

10.  The  judge  could  find  no  basis  for  justifying  going  behind  the
    observations made by the judge at her trial, and in  the  circumstances
    considered he had to take it that the appellant was aware of  what  was
    done to get her into the United Kingdom and was knowingly complicit  in
    what took place and, after her husband's death, chose to continue  with
    the fraud.

11.  The judge said that with regard to the appellant's integration he  took
    it as a requirement that she should be able to demonstrate  an  ability
    to participate in wider society and not  within  the  confines  of  her
    home, family and members of the Pakistani diaspora.  Central to this he
    thought was her ability to speak English at least  sufficiently  to  be
    able to access relevant services, to go shopping and the like with  the
    need for an interpreter.

12.  The judge considered the fact  that  the  appellant  gave  evidence  in
    Mirpuri would go not only to her ability to integrate into Pakistan but
    also would indicate that after 25 to 30 years in  England  her  English
    was not good.  This  was  confirmed  by  paragraph  9  of  her  witness
    statement and her need for the assistance of  relatives.   The  witness
    statements in support, he said were from her children and wider  family
    and went more to her role in the family than supporting  a  claim  that
    she had integrated in the wider community.   In  the  circumstances  he
    considered that the evidence did not show that she  could  be  said  to
    have integrated into the UK socially or culturally.

13.  With regard to obstacles to her integration into Pakistan,  as  he  had
    noted she still preferred to communicate in Mirpuri and that was a fact
    which would assist her.  Considerations under this aspect he considered
    really turned on her health and the level of support she would need and
    her ability to access it in Pakistan.

14.  In her witness statement she had referred to a  diagnosis  and  to  her
    health deteriorating whilst she was in prison and that  she  relied  on
    her children for emotional support and would not be  able  to  live  in
    Pakistan without them.

15.  With regard to medical evidence, there was evidence  from  7  September
    2015 regarding a minor blood disorder but no suggestion that this could
    have any implications for her.  There was reference in the letter of 26
    May 2016 to her liver condition and that treatment  was  available  and
    there was no history of note.  There  was  a  letter  of  4  June  2018
    concerning a diagnosis of depression and anxiety and this was  directly
    related to the deportation proceedings, there was no suicidal  ideation
    and no suggestion that any treatment was required or being prescribed.

16.  Her health records were provided which covered the period from  January
    1995 to date and included reference to the  liver  complaint  and  knee
    osteoporosis and entries for low mood and anxiety state NOS from  April
    2018.  The judge considered that what she did experience was  a  series
    of ailments of varying sorts all of which had been dealt with  and  had
    no long-term consequences for her.

17.  The most recent medical letter was dated 4 April  2018.   There  was  a
    diagnosis of anxiety and  in  the  notes  it  was  suggested  that  the
    appellant had collapsed in court after  hearing  bad  news,  which  the
    judge presumed to be related to her upcoming sentencing hearing.  There
    was no evidence to show what if anything had been done with regard to a
    recommended review.  She had attended the hearing in a  wheelchair  but
    there was no medical evidence to explain why  that  was  needed  or  if
    there was an  underlying  condition.   The  evidence  did  not  show  a
    significant problem and there was continuing treatment.

18.  As regards her return to Pakistan the evidence was  from  her  and  her
    family that she had no relatives there.  The evidence did not show that
    she needed help with performing daily tasks or that she had  long  term
    healthcare needs that could not be met in Pakistan.  If  she  did  need
    daily assistance there was no evidence that  such  assistance  was  not
    available or would be unaffordable in Pakistan.

19.  The judge accepted from  the  witness  statements  in  support  of  the
    appellant that she had played an important role in family life  in  the
    United Kingdom and was close to her family here.  He accepted that  she
    would miss her family  if  deported  and  she  would  not  receive  the
    physical support that they provided in the UK as matters stood.  He did
    not accept that she would be without financial  support  as  the  money
    spent on her support in the United Kingdom could be  remitted  for  her
    use in Pakistan where it would go further.  As he had noted, there  was
    no evidence to show that any treatment she  might  need  would  not  be
    available in Pakistan.

20.  There was  no  evidence  that  she  had  taken  steps  to  address  her
    offending behaviour and he could not find that she was not at  risk  of
    reoffending.  She could not meet the provisions of paragraph  399A  and
    the evidence did not show that there were very compelling circumstances
    beyond the provisions of that paragraph.  The  appeal  was  accordingly
    dismissed.

21.  The appellant sought and was  granted  permission  to  appeal,  on  the
    basis that it was arguable  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  consider
    adequately the evidence of the witnesses who attended the hearing as to
    the ability of the appellant to reintegrate upon her return to Pakistan
    after 30 years absence, when she would return as a widow.

22.  At the hearing Mr Howard adopted and developed the points made  in  the
    grounds.  There was a question as to whether adequate consideration had
    been given to the evidence of the  six  witnesses  as  to  whether  the
    appellant could reintegrate back into Pakistan.  She was  a  widow  who
    had been in the United Kingdom for over  30  years.   The  evidence  of
    these witnesses was clearly relevant.

23.  In his submissions Mr Lindsay argued  that  it  was  unclear  from  the
    letters or statements how the witnesses  said  they  had  come  by  the
    knowledge and experience  about  difficulties  on  return.   They  were
    British citizens and there was no indication of any  recent  direct  or
    indirect knowledge of the country situation in Pakistan  for  a  person
    with the appellant's characteristics.  It was therefore  not  probative
    of the issue concerning the  situation  facing  the  appellant  on  her
    return.  The judge could not conclude that there was  a  real  risk  of
    difficulties on return.

24.  The judge had in any event clearly considered the  witnesses'  evidence
    as could be seen at paragraphs 23 and 24 of his decision.  He  had  not
    just considered her role in the family but also referred  to  obstacles
    to integration into Pakistan.  The skeleton argument before  the  judge
    referred  to  her  being  at  risk  on  return   but   this   was   not
    particularised.  There was reference to the decision in  SM  but  there
    was no issue as to the risk of persecution in her home area and SM made
    it clear that it would not usually be unduly harsh for an  older  woman
    to relocate to a city.  Nor was there any evidence that  there  was  no
    shelter place available for her.

25.  There was no obligation to  adopt  a  balance  sheet  approach  as  was
    argued in ground 2.  The judge had considered all the relevant  matters
    and not considered irrelevant matters.

26.  Ground 3 overlapped with ground 1.  It concerned medical  evidence  and
    return as a widow who had been in the United Kingdom for 30 years.  The
    judge had properly considered the medical and other evidence.

27.  By way of reply Mr Howard made the point that the  witnesses  had  been
    asked when they were last in Pakistan.  They were in a position to give
    an informal view.  There was a gap in the judge's consideration  as  to
    whether the appellant could reintegrate into Pakistan, and the evidence
    of the witnesses was relevant to that.  There was a lack of findings in
    a very material aspect of the case.

28.  I reserved my decision.

29.  The key issue in this challenge to the judge's decision is that of  the
    claimed failure on the part of the  judge  to  take  into  account  the
    evidence of the six witnesses with regard to the appellant's social and
    cultural integration into the United Kingdom  and  the  issue  of  very
    significant  obstacles  to  her  integration  on  return  to  Pakistan.
    Grounds 2 and 3 raise lesser  matters,  and  are  in  essence  subsumed
    within ground 1 though I will  refer  to  them  both  separately  after
    considering ground 1.

30.  I have set out above what the judge had to say about  the  evidence  of
    the witnesses.  The statements are to be found at tab B of the  bundle.
    Fatimah Rashid who is the appellant's daughter refers to the fact  that
    her mother being removed from the United Kingdom will not only distance
    her from her family but will make her health condition  worse  than  it
    already is as there will be no-one to support her and going to Pakistan
    will be dangerous for her especially as she is now a widow  and  people
    like her are attacked.  Pervaz Khaliq, who  is  the  appellant's  niece
    said that sending her aunt to Pakistan would  condemn  her  to  a  life
    without any support, family life or protection from the  harsh  reality
    of Pakistan life and she has no place to live and all  her  family  who
    are close to her are in the United Kingdom.  Also Amina Rashid who is a
    daughter of the appellant said that if the appellant were deported back
    to Pakistan she would not be able to cope mentally as she did not  have
    a support system there and no close family and she  would  be  made  to
    suffer and would be abused as she would be alone and it  was  not  safe
    for a lone woman in  Pakistan.   In  addition  the  appellant's  sister
    Kaneez Akhtar referred to the appellant suffering in Pakistan as  there
    was no-one there for her and no house to live in and her life would end
    in misery and her health was deteriorating and she has her children  in
    the United Kingdom to take care of her otherwise she will  be  left  to
    suffer.  Mohammed Ibrahim Khan who is a nephew of  the  appellant  said
    that sending her back to Pakistan could make her health condition worse
    by not being able to live a family life and she has no  family  members
    in Pakistan who would care for  her  like  her  family  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  In a further statement Riffat Khaliq refers to the fact  that
    a woman carrying the title of a divorcee and having been through prison
    would be seen as a curse and a disgrace to society, and  Samina  Bashir
    also said that she believes the appellant has no future in Pakistan  as
    she has no family abroad, her parents  are  deceased,  her  health  has
    deteriorated drastically and she is in a position  where  she  requires
    support from her family.

31.  In my view it cannot properly be said that  the  relevant  issues  were
    not considered by the judge.  At paragraph 23 of his decision he  noted
    the witness statements from the appellant's children and  wider  family
    and what they said about her role in the family, a point that  he  also
    referred to at paragraph 31 and the impact on the appellant of  missing
    her family if deported and the  lack  of  physical  support  that  they
    provide in the United Kingdom.  He also referred at paragraph 24 to the
    fact that she still prefers  to  communicate  in  Mirpuri  rather  than
    English.  As noted above also, he gave detailed  consideration  to  the
    medical evidence and noted that there was nothing of  any  significance
    precluding the appellant's return.

32.  I do not consider, considering these points as a whole, that the  judge
    can be said to have erred in law in his consideration of the  issue  of
    very significant obstacles to the appellant's return to Pakistan.   The
    letters which in broad terms were  taken  into  account  refer  to  the
    difficulties that  the  appellant  might  experience  in  Pakistan  and
    undoubtedly it is the case that having lived in the United Kingdom  for
    30 years and being cut off from her family who are living in the United
    Kingdom it would be difficult for her.  But it was fully  open  to  the
    judge, having considered the evidence as he did, to conclude  that  the
    evidence before him did not show  the  existence  of  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's integration on return to Pakistan nor  did
    it show that she was socially and culturally integrated into the United
    Kingdom.

33.  As regards ground 2, where it  is  said  that  the  judge  appeared  to
    accept that  but  for  the  conviction  removal  would  not  have  been
    considered on any basis and this implied a strong Article  8  basis  to
    the claim, this has to be seen in the context of the fact that there is
    a conviction  and  that  the  judge  carried  out  a  proper  balancing
    exercise.  It is clear that a balance sheet approach is not required as
    long as the relevant issues have been considered, and in my  view  they
    were.  Contrary to what is  contended  in  ground  3,  I  consider  the
    medical evidence was adequately considered and likewise the fact of her
    return as a widow and having been in the United Kingdom  for  30  years
    were also addressed.  In conclusion therefore I consider  that  it  has
    not been shown that the judge erred in  law  in  any  respect  and  his
    decision dismissing this appeal stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
