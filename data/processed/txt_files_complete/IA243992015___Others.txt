Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr C Mahfuz, Counsel, instructed by Malik Law
                    Chambers Solicitors (Bethnal Green Road)
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the respondent.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt  of  court.  I  make
    this order because a similar order was made in the First-tier  Tribunal
    and some of the Respondents are minors.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of five  members  of  the  same
    family against a decision of the Secretary of State on 18 June 2015  to
    refuse them leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 3. The respondents are all citizens of Pakistan.   The  first  and  second
    respondents are married to each  other.  The  other  respondents  their
    minor children. Of particular concern to me is the welfare of the third
    and fourth respondents who were born in Pakistan but who have lived  in
    the United Kingdom for a large part of their lives, in  fact  since  26
    June 2008.

 4. Ms Brocklesby-Weller very properly immediately drew my attention to the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in the case reported as MA (Pakistan) &
    Ors, R (on the application of) v Upper Tribunal [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705.
    That was an appeal that concerned several cases brought by families and
    particularly children who wished to remain in the  United  Kingdom  and
    the Court of Appeal gave guidance on the proper approach  to  be  taken
    when determining what was reasonable in  the  case  of  a  child  being
    removed.

 5. In this case, without the benefit of the guidance in MA, the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge decided that it was not reasonable  for  the  third  and
    fourth children to be removed and particularly not the third child, who
    suffers from cerebral palsy  and  benefits  from  the  quite  extensive
    regime of support provided largely through the  school  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 6. Whether the Secretary of State  would  have  bothered  challenging  the
    decision if the decision in MA (Pakistan) had been available  when  the
    grounds had to be prepared  is  a  matter  for  conjecture  but  it  is
    exceedingly difficult in the light of the decision in  MA  to  identify
    any error of law on the part of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  I  have
    considered the papers and I am entirely satisfied that there is nothing
    unlawful  about  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision.   There  is  no
    irrationality or no incorrect direction of law.

 7. It follows therefore that the decision to allow the appeal for the sake
    of the children was entirely open to the  judge  and  the  decision  to
    allow the appeal of the other members of the family consequentially was
    a necessary decision which is not independently challenged.  It follows
    therefore that I dismiss the appeal of the Secretary of  State  against
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in all cases and  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal will stand.

Notice of Decision

 8. The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
