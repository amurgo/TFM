For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellants are  citizens  of  Sri  Lanka.  They  have  appealed
         against decisions dated 18 September  2014  of  the  respondent  to
         remove them from the United Kingdom having refused their claims for
         asylum.

      2. In a determination dated 8 January  2015  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         (Judge R  Handley)  dismissed  their  appeals.  Unfortunately,  the
         judge's determination bears no relation whatever to the  claim  for
         asylum made by the appellants. The accounts of past events  in  Sri
         Lanka which the judge purports  to  analyse  at  [35-47]  bears  no
         resemblance to the accounts provided by the  appellants  to  either
         the First-tier Tribunal or the respondent. It is not clear how this
         has occurred but it is clear that the  determination  must  be  set
         aside and the appeal heard again by the  First-tier  Tribunal  (not
         Judge Handley). None of the findings of fact shall stand.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal dated 8  January  2015  is  set
aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  that  Tribunal
(not Judge Handley) to remake the decision. None of  the  findings  of  fact
shall stand.

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

    We continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
