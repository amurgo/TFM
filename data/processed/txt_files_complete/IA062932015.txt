                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                   AMENDED NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL
   (amended under Rule 42 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
                                    2008)

By letter dated 12  October  2015  the  appellant  solicitors  informed  the
Tribunal that he wanted to withdraw his appeal. He  offered  no  explanation
but I see no reason to continue with a hearing that the appellant  does  not
want.

Pursuant to rule 17(2) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
2008 I give permission to the appellant to withdraw his appeal.

This is a Notice pursuant to rule 17(5) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008 to the parties that the  appeal  is  withdrawn  at  the
appellant's request and with the permission of the Upper Tribunal.


| Signed                              |                                     |
|Jonathan Perkins                     |Dated 6 November 2015                |
|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Re-Dated 17 November 2015            |
