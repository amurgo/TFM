                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, AMOA, date of birth 9.12.70, is a citizen of Libya.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Malik promulgated 8.6.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision of
    the Secretary of State to refuse his  asylum,  humanitarian  protection
    and human rights claims.  The Judge heard the appeal on 27.5.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Landes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 1.9.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.



Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Malik should be set aside.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Landes found it  arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge should have found  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State not in accordance with the  law,  having  considered
    the position of the children on the basis that they had  only  been  in
    the UK since 2013, rather than  considering  their  overall  length  of
    residence and that although the appellant and her children returned  to
    Libya in 2013, it was only temporarily and  two  of  the  children  had
    lived in the UK for at least 7 years by the date of the decision.

 7. Alternatively, Judge Landes  found  it  arguable  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge erred in refusing  to  adjourn  for  a  social  worker's
    report. Whilst the judge was right to  observe  at  �10  that  she  was
    empowered to consider the best interests of  the  children,  given  the
    statutory guidance that the children  should  be  consulted  and  their
    wishes and feelings  of  the  children  should  have  been  taken  into
    account, "it is arguable that the judge was not  sufficiently  equipped
    to conduct a best interests assessment without information  as  to  the
    children's views (see in particular [30] and [39] of MK (section  55  -
    Tribunal options) Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 223)."  When applying for an
    adjournment a few days before  the  hearing,  the  representatives  had
    indicated that as they had not been able to secure funding for a social
    work report they had arranged for a social worker  to  take  statements
    from the children so their views could be  expressed,  but  it  appears
    this had not been done by the day of the hearing. As it happens,  so  I
    am now informed, funding was granted on the day of the hearing but  the
    representatives were not aware of this.

 8. Judge Landes did not restrict the grounds to be  argued,  but  observed
    that the ground averring that the judge  erred  by  not  adjourning  to
    await an expert country report had less force, given that at  the  date
    of the hearing no funding was available and  there  was  no  indication
    that a report might be available at a later date.

 9. The Rule 24 response,  dated  17.7.15,  submits  that  the  judge  made
    sustainable findings that were properly open to her  on  the  evidence.
    "The respondent will submit that the grounds advanced by the  appellant
    fail to  disclose  material  arguable  errors  of  law  that  would  be
    considered capable of having a material impact upon the outcome of  the
    appeal." It is submitted that although the judge  found  three  of  the
    children had lived in the  UK  in  excess  of  7  years  and  correctly
    directed herself as to the eligibility requirements of E-LTRPT 2.2  and
    that EX1 was engaged, the judge made reasonable findings properly  open
    on the evidence that it  would  nevertheless  not  be  unreasonable  to
    expect the children to leave the UK. "Despite accepting that the  three
    children, having lived in the UK  over  7  years  will  have  developed
    educational, social and cultural connections outside of school and that
    their removal from the UK will break such ties and indeed  despite  the
    FTJ fully appreciating that the children would prefer to live in the UK
    it  was  nevertheless  properly  open  to  the  FTJ  to  conclude  that
    notwithstanding these findings this is not a case  where  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the appellant's children to leave  the  UK,  nor
    that  they  would  encounter  very  significant  obstacles   to   their
    integration in Libya. The respondent will submit that the FTJ  provided
    adequate reasons to support (her) findings at paragraphs 29-30  of  the
    Determination."

10. "As regards relevance of section 55 of the best interests of the child,
    it was properly open to the  FTJ  to  conclude  that  the  respondent's
    decision does not constitute a disproportionate  breach  of  article  8
    ECHR on private or family life grounds and the  FTJ  provides  adequate
    sustainable reasons to support (her) findings that the decision of  the
    respondent is in accordance with the law. [Paragraph 33 determination.]
    The appellants grounds are  advanced  in  mere  disagreement  with  the
    negative outcome of  the  appeal  and  do  not  disclose  any  material
    arguable error of law."

11. Before  reaching  my  decision  on  error  of  law,  I  have  carefully
    considered the decisions of MK and JO  and  others  (section  55  duty)
    Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC), relied on by Ms Smith.

12. There are four children. The eldest two were born in Libya in 2001  and
    2005 and are now 10 and 14 years of age. Another child was born in 2008
    and is now 7 years of age. The youngest was born in 2013 and is now two
    years of age.

13. MK held that the burden is on  the  appellant  to  demonstrate  on  the
    balance of probabilities that there has been a breach of section 55  by
    the Secretary of State. Further, even if there is such a breach, it  is
    clear that it remains open to the Tribunal not to remit  the  decision,
    provided the Tribunal is  satisfied  that  it  is  itself  sufficiently
    equipped to make an adequate assessment of the best  interests  of  any
    affected child. That, in my view, is what the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    was entitled to and did do.

14. It is clear that the judge proceeded on the  basis  that  the  children
    would wish to remain in the UK as a family unit.

15. I note that the refusal decision was  made  on  12.2.15  and  thus  the
    appellant had over 3 months to obtain and provide such evidence  as  he
    wanted the Tribunal to consider.

16. It was open to the appellant and her representatives to have statements
    or even letters taken from the children  to  express  their  views.  Ms
    Smith was unable to explain why that was not  done,  particularly  when
    they knew that their application for  adjournment  made  prior  to  the
    hearing date had been refused. I also note  that  the  appellant's  own
    witness statement, dated 26.5.15, does not address the  best  interests
    issue at all. She could have  given  a  further  witness  statement  to
    address this issue.

17. There  is,  even  now,  very  little  documentary  evidence  about  the
    children, just two letters from the schools of the older two  children.
    It is difficult in such circumstances, where the appellant has  adduced
    so little evidence as  to  the  best  interests  of  the  children,  to
    demonstrate that the Secretary of State is in breach of section 55. The
    appellant has failed  to  demonstrate  what  best  interests  were  not
    adequately considered either by the Secretary of State or the  Tribunal
    judge.

18. In ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4, Baroness Hale opined at  �82  that  the
    "court will have to consider whether there  are  any  special  features
    requiring further investigation of the  children's  interests,  but  in
    most cases it should be able to proceed with what it has." In MK it was
    held that a Tribunal should have regard to  its  adjournment  and  case
    management powers, together with the overriding objective.  "They  will
    also take into account the facilities available  to  the  Secretary  of
    State under the statutory guidance, the desirability  of  finality  and
    the undesirability of undue delay." The  Guidance  also  provides  that
    "children should be consulted and the wishes and feelings  of  children
    taken into account whenever practicable when decisions  affecting  them
    are made."

19. As stated in Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] 1 WLR 3690, it is important to  have
    a clear idea of a child's circumstances, and what is in a child's  best
    interests before considering whether the force of other  considerations
    outweighs those  interests.  There  is  no  substitute  for  a  careful
    examination of all relevant factors when the interests of a  child  are
    involved.

20. However, on the facts of this case I find that the appellant has failed
    to demonstrate that failure on the part of the Secretary  of  State  to
    conduct interviews with the  children  gives  rise  to  any  breach  of
    section 55. In JO, the Tribunal concluded that the issue did not  arise
    because the existence of the children had been disclosed  and  evidence
    relating to them was included with the application. However, at �36  of
    MK the Tribunal reflected on the realities of the various  scenario  of
    any appeal where  the  duties  imposed  by  section  55  had  not  been
    performed by the Secretary of State, which includes where it appears to
    the Tribunal that the information and representations advanced  on  the
    appellant's  behalf  "invited  further  enquiries  or  elucidation   or
    evidence gathering of this kind on the part of the Secretary of State."
    In this case, the appellant appears to have adduced no  such  evidence,
    or even submissions, so as to give rise to a  duty  to  invite  further
    submissions or evidence. It is not for the Secretary of State to be the
    primary fact finder or investigator in such circumstances.

21. Considering the way in which the judge addressed the best interests  of
    the children, primarily from �29 onwards, it can be seen that the judge
    accepted  that  the  three  elder   children   would   have   developed
    educational, social and cultural ties. Despite  the  distinct  lack  of
    evidence on the issue, the judge made the not  unreasonable  assumption
    that the children will have made friends and become accustomed  to  the
    UK, and that removal would break such ties, and that they would  prefer
    to remain in the UK. There was no evidence that they would not be  able
    to continue education in Libya. In fact, when they returned in 2013 the
    appellant enrolled the three elder children in school.

22. On the facts of this case, I am not satisfied that it was necessary  to
    obtain an expert social worker report to determine the  wishes  of  the
    children. Ms Smith has failed to identify any  particular  concerns  or
    issues in respect of these children, or that their best interests would
    not  be  obvious  from  the  general  background  and  history  of  the
    appellant, or any  features  or  factors  which  would  or  could  have
    produced any different outcome to the conclusion of the judge as to the
    best interests of the children. I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  conducted  a  careful  examination  of  all   relevant
    information and factors. As JO held, the question whether  the  section
    55 duties have been duly performed in any given case will invariably be
    an intensely fact sensitive and contextual one. "in the real  world  of
    litigation, the tools available to the court  or  Tribunal  considering
    this question  will  frequently  be  confined  to  the  application  or
    submission made to the Secretary of Sate and  the  ultimate  letter  of
    decision."

23. In the circumstances, and for the reasons set  out  herein,  I  do  not
    accept that  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  in
    accordance with the law. I fail to understand what  in  particular  the
    Secretary of  State  should  have  taken  into  account  that  was  not
    considered and which would have made any material difference. I find no
    error of law in the judge's deciding to continue with the  hearing  and
    to make her own assessment of  the  best  interests  of  the  children,
    rather than adjourning, when it was far from clear that  financing  for
    an expert social work report was available. Further,  it  is  far  from
    clear what an expert  social  work  report  could  have  added  to  the
    assessment conducted by the judge. Ms  Smith  suggests  that  a  report
    could have assessed the issue of the fear of the children. That is mere
    speculation, but even now there is no evidence to discharge the  burden
    of proof that there are any considerations that could  or  should  have
    been taken into account, but  were  not.  The  finding  that  the  best
    interests of the children were to return to Libya with their parents is
    fully reasoned and supported on the evidence and the  circumstances  of
    this case.

24. I find no error of law in the ground suggesting that the  judge  should
    have adjourned for a country expert report. Again, I fail  to  see  how
    this could have provided any material assistance to  the  appellant  or
    her family members. Her asylum account was rejected  in  its  entirety.
    The judge found both the account  of  the  appellant's  daughter  being
    kidnapped and of his wife having links to the former Gaddafi regime was
    incredible. At �28 the judge considered the submission that  there  had
    been a deterioration in Libya since AT  &  others  (Article  15c;  risk
    categories) Libya CG [2014] UKUT 318 (IAC) was decided.  The  appellant
    did not fall into any of the risk categories and in  fact  returned  to
    Libya on two post-revolution occasions, accompanied  by  his  wife  and
    children.  They  returned  to  and  exited  Libya   in   2013   without
    experiencing any difficulties, leading  the  judge  to  conclude  that,
    contrary to the appellant's  account,  the  family  is  of  no  adverse
    interest to the current regime in Libya. Nevertheless, the  judge  also
    took into account the background country  material  referenced  in  the
    Secretary of  State's  refusal  decision,  and  that  material  in  the
    appellant's  bundle,  including  those  passages  highlighted  by   the
    appellant's representative. I find it was open to the judge to conclude
    that there was no adequate reason to depart from the relatively  recent
    country guidance case.

25. In the circumstances, I find no error of law in the alleged failure  of
    the judge to adjourn for  country  expert  evidence.  Once  again,  the
    appellant had had  ample  time  to  gather  and  present  such  country
    background evidence as he wanted and there was no evidence that funding
    would be available for such an expert report.

Conclusions:

26. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did make an order.

Given  the  circumstances  that  children  are  involved,  I  continue   the
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
