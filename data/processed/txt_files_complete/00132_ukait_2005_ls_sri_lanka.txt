                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by a  citizen  of  Sri  Lanka  against  refusal  of  a
   residence permit as the dependant of an European  Union  citizen  on  29
   October 2004. The appellant's aunt is a German citizen who is exercizing
   her treaty rights in this country: we shall call her  the  sponsor.  The
   other relevant dates are:

1979. appellant born in Sri Lanka
1984. appellant lives with sponsor in Sri Lanka
   1984          sponsor goes to Germany
   1998          sponsor becomes German citizen; moves to United Kingdom
   03.11.1999    appellant comes to United Kingdom
        01.2004  appellant begins to live with sponsor in United Kingdom

2.  By  regulation  10.4  of  the  Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)
   Regulations 2000:

   The conditions [for the issue of a residence permit to a  dependant]  are
   that the person [is a relative of an EEA national or his spouse and]-
     a. is dependent on the EEA national or his spouse;
     b. is living as part of the EEA national's household outside the United
        Kingdom;  or
     c. was living as part of the EEA national's household  before  the  EEA
        national came to the United Kingdom.

   These conditions are alternatives: see PB [2005] UKIAT  00082 � 10.
3. A number of points were taken in the refusal letter, but Mrs  Tedeschini
   helpfully confined herself before us to the following issues:

     a) During the period 1979-84, while the appellant and the sponsor  were
        living in the same house as part of a typical extended  family,  was
        he living as part of her household in terms of paragraph 10.4c?

     b) At the date of the decision, was he  dependent  on  the  sponsor  in
        terms of paragraph 10.4a?

   It is common ground that nothing turns on paragraph  10.4b,  since  that
   deals with cases where the claimant is seeking to join the sponsor  from
   outside this country. We shall deal first with issue b).

4.  The  evidence  of  the  appellant   and   the   sponsor,   substantially
   unchallenged, is that since January 2004 he had been  staying  with  her,
   not making any contribution to the household, but  not  getting  anything
   from her beyond his board and lodging. That we suspect is  not  untypical
   for a family member from a developing country who has not  yet  succeeded
   in getting permanent residence in the European Union, when  staying  with
   another who has. Then in April last  year  the  Home  Office  forbad  the
   appellant to work: he had  lost  his  asylum  appeal,  and  been  refused
   permission to appeal by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Since  then  all
   the appellant's financial needs have been met by the sponsor: either  she
   gives him money or takes him shopping and pays herself, and that was  the
   state of affairs at the date of the decision last October.

5. Mrs Tedeschini suggested that "dependent" in  regulation  10.4a  must  be
   read in the light of the purpose of the regulations as a whole, which she
   suggested was to remove any brake on the freedom of movement of  European
   Union citizens. That is undoubtedly right; and if there were any room for
   doubt as to the meaning of the word in that context,  the  purpose  might
   help to clear it up. Mrs Tedeschini could not suggest a  precise  meaning
   for the word in context; but she was inclined to suggest that  it  should
   be read as requiring something like a dependency of necessity.  (She  had
   also  suggested,  with  understandable  lack  of  enthusiasm,  that   the
   appellant might have been able to get NASS support, rather  than  relying
   on his aunt; but when the history of his  asylum  claim  was  given,  she
   withdrew that point).

6. Even if dependency of necessity were required, it would in  our  view  be
   arguable that it was satisfied in  this  case:  it  was  because  British
   legislation prevented the appellant from working that he had to  rely  on
   the sponsor. However, the only authority to which  we  were  referred  by
   either side as to the meaning of 'dependent' in the European  legislation
   was (by Mr Mukherjee) Lebon (ECJ case 316/85,  judgment  18  June  1987).
   Lebon dealt not  with  freedom  of  movement,  but  with  entitlement  to
   benefits under regulation 10 of Regulation 1612/68: however  1612/68  was
   the foundation for our 2000 Regulations (see PB 05-82 � 5), though it  is
   cited as 1612/98 at � 4). There is in our view  no  reason  to  interpret
   'dependent' in different ways for the  purposes  of  the  same  piece  of
   European legislation. What Lebon decided, on  the  point  in  issue  (see
   ruling 2) was this:

   The status of dependent member of a worker's family ...is the result of a
   factual situation, namely the provision of support by the worker, without
   there being any need  to  determine  the  reasons  for  recourse  to  the
   worker's support.

7. While strictly  nothing  we  say  on  this  point  is  necessary  to  our
   decision, if  the  withdrawal  of  permission  to  work  meant  that  the
   appellant was on any conceivable test dependent on  the  sponsor  by  the
   date of the decision under appeal, we have to say that in our view  Lebon
   means that, if a claimant is at the date of the decision dependent  on  a
   European Union citizen exercizing  treaty  rights  here  as  an  ordinary
   matter of fact (and clearly financial dependency is what is meant  here),
   then there is no room for doubt or for going into  the  reasons  for  the
   dependency. It follows that this appeal must be allowed.

8. We have to confess to some relief in reaching  that  conclusion  by  this
   route, since what had been left clear and logical  in  PB  05-82  on  the
   interpretation of regulation 10.4c has been made much less so by the view
   the Home Office have chosen (as Mrs Tedeschini told us) to  take  on  it.
   The Tribunal in PB 05-82 took the view, for good  reasons  including  the
   purpose of the regulations, that "...was living ...before ..."  means  in
   effect 'immediately before', so that the benefit of  the  regulations  is
   only taken by those who might otherwise be deterred from exercizing their
   treaty rights by not  being  able  to  bring  current  members  of  their
   households to this country.

9. The Home Office, for reasons best known to themselves, have  not  adopted
   this view, but have taken the  position  that  any  living  in  the  same
   household (at least for more than a minimal time)  at  however  remote  a
   date, is enough to satisfy  the  requirements  of  this  regulation.  The
   potential absurdity of this construction would be well illustrated by the
   present appeal, if it had to be allowed  on  the  sole  basis  that  this
   appellant was entitled to a residence permit in 2004 because he had lived
   with the sponsor as part of an extended family unit in 1979-84. We  think
   the Home Office would find they had a great deal of explaining to  do  to
   the public, if it became known that they  had  resiled  from  a  Tribunal
   decision  in  their  favour  on  this  point,  and  preferred  their  own
   interpretation, with all its potential absurdity. We  suggest  they  give
   the point some hard thought, before another case comes up which turns  on
   it alone.
