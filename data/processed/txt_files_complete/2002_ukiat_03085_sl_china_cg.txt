                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Representation

For the Appellant:           Mr D Ekagha, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance by or on behalf of the Respondent


1.    The Appellant,  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department,
      appeals with leave of the Tribunal against  the  determination  of  an
      Adjudicator (Mr R D Lewis) allowing the Article 3 human rights  appeal
      of the Respondent, a citizen of China,  after  dismissing  his  asylum
      appeal.

2.    In this case the Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 3 April  2000
      and claimed asylum at the port of entry on that date.

3.    The Appellant's claim to  asylum  is  his  fear  of  military  service
      because he is the only son of his parents.  At interview he  had  said
      that he had reached the age for conscription and had received an order
      to report for duty.  He did not want to serve because he had been told
      that people who joined the military service in 1998 had been  sent  to
      Tibet and of the ten who joined, eight died due to the lack of  oxygen
      in the high altitudes of that country.  His moral objection to serving
      was that he was the only son and his parents did not want anything  to
      happen to him.  He was due to join the army on 16 January, but did not
      do so, and his parents were then detained and released  about  a  week
      later.  He considered that the punishment he would receive  for  draft
      evasion would be about three years at least, although it could  be  as
      much as six years.

4.    The Adjudicator took into account the objective  evidence  which  says
      that conscription is compulsory for male citizens in China between the
      ages of 18 and 22.  The army takes its pick of the 18  year  olds  and
      places the remainder on the reserve, that those remain liable for call
      up until the age of 22.  Conscientious objection is not recognised and
      desertion and draft avoidance has become more common in recent  times.
      He also took account of  the  objective  evidence  which  states  that
      Chinese prisons are unpleasant places.

5.    He also took account  of  the  objective  evidence  that  the  Chinese
      government accepts the repatriation of citizens who have entered other
      countries or territories illegally.  Returnees  are  generally  fined.
      Those who have been repatriated a second time, typically are sent to a
      labour camp in addition to being fined.  First offenders,  of  leaving
      without an exit permit and Chinese passport,  are  typically  given  a
      sentence of three months.   Detention is normal  until  the  trial  is
      over.   There is, however, a range  of  opinion  on  penalties.   Most
      agree on around the 5,000 Yuan mark (�350) for the first offence, with
      one expert saying such fines are rarely imposed  in  practice  anyway,
      with another expert saying that usually two days' detention is imposed
      instead and added that the fine for a second offence  is  between  200
      and 500 Yuan (�15 to �40).

6.    The Adjudicator found the Appellant a credible  witness  and  accepted
      much of his story.  However, he found that the Appellant did not avoid
      military service on grounds  of  conscience.   He  avoided  the  draft
      because he did not want to serve in Tibet and because he was  an  only
      son.  Fear of punishment  for  draft  evasion  does  not,  in  itself,
      constitute persecution.  A draft  evader  may  be  a  refugee  if  his
      punishment would be disproportionately severe for a Convention reason.
        In this case the Appellant said he could face imprisonment for up to
      three years with additional time for the time he was absent.  This  is
      a severe punishment that would be served in harsh conditions but it is
      a  penalty  that  is  imposed   on   all   draft   evaders   and   not
      disproportionately on the Appellant for a Convention reason.

7.    The Adjudicator was therefore satisfied that the  Respondent  did  not
      have a well-founded fear of persecution when he left his  country  nor
      that there is a real risk that he would be persecuted for a Convention
      reason should he be returned to China.

8.     However,  in  allowing  the  appeal  under  Article  3  of  the  1950
      Convention, the Adjudicator stated in paragraph 35 as follows:

         "In this case I am satisfied that although the Appellant is  not  a
         refugee within the meaning of the 1952 Convention, his rights under
         the 1950 Convention are engaged.  If he were a simple returnee then
         it is likely that he would receive no more than a fine.  But he  is
         not a simple returnee.  He is a draft evader and I  consider  there
         is a real possibility that if he returned to  China  those  details
         would  be  rapidly  established  and  he  would  be   detained   in
         circumstances described  by  the  State  Department  as  harsh  and
         frequently degrading.  In those circumstances I am  satisfied  that
         there is a real risk that  should  the  Appellant  be  returned  to
         China, the United Kingdom would be in  breach  of  its  obligations
         under Article 3 of the 1950 Convention."


9.    Mr Ekagha referred the Tribunal to paragraph 4.81 of the  Home  Office
    CIPU Report of April 2002 on China.   He submitted that the attitude of
    the Chinese government is that a draft evader can buy himself out  with
    a fine, which means that he does  not  have  to  go  to  prison.   This
    indicates that there will be no risk of torture  in  prison.   He  also
    submitted that military service is compulsory for all men between 18 to
    22 years old.  The Appellant is now  23  years  old  and  is  therefore
    outside the qualifying age.

10.   Mr Ekagha also drew our attention  to  paragraph  6.154  in  the  CIPU
    Report on returnees.  This  states  that  the  government  accepts  the
    repatriation  of  citizens  who  have  entered   other   countries   or
    territories illegally, returnees generally are fined.  The Tribunal  is
    aware that the Adjudicator took  this  evidence  into  account  in  his
    consideration of the Respondent's appeal.

11.   In this  case  there  was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent.  His representatives submitted a written submission on  his
    behalf and a bundle of documents  and  requested  that  the  appeal  be
    determined on the basis of the papers.

12.    One  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  by  the  Appellant  was  that  the
    Adjudicator gave no reasons for  his  conclusion  that  the  Respondent
    would be likely to  be  imprisoned  for  draft  evasion  or  that  such
    imprisonment would expose the Respondent  to  a  real  risk  of  cruel,
    inhuman or degrading treatment.  Given that the high threshold set  for
    Article 3 claims where the responsibility for the infliction of harm is
    on the receiving state rather than the  contracting  state  (Bensaid  v
    UK), the Secretary of State would contend that the  evidence  available
    to the Adjudicator does not demonstrate a real risk of cruel or inhuman
    degrading treatment in this particular case.

13.    The  grounds  of  appeal  further  submitted  that  given  the  close
    correlation between Article 3 and asylum claims, the Tribunal in  Kacaj
    found that an appeal  which  failed  on  asylum  grounds  would  rarely
    succeed under Article 3  on  the  same  facts.   The  Adjudicator  gave
    insufficient reasons for his decision that this case is one of the rare
    exceptions.  Therefore the Adjudicator's decision is flawed.  Leave was
    granted on the basis of these grounds.

14.   We note from the Respondent's submission that he  disagrees  with  the
    submission that the Adjudicator gave no reason for his conclusion  that
    the Respondent would be likely to be imprisoned for draft evasion.   It
    was submitted that reasons were given in paragraphs 30 and  35  of  the
    determination.  We disagree.   In paragraph 30 the Adjudicator  appears
    to accept the Respondent's evidence that he could face imprisonment for
    up to three years with additional time for  the  time  he  was  absent,
    without stating why this is likely to happen to this Respondent.

15.   On our reading of paragraph 35, it appears to us that the  Adjudicator
    allowed the appeal under Article 3 by reason of the conditions in which
    the Respondent would be detained, which  have  been  described  by  the
    State Department as harsh and frequently degrading.  The  Tribunal  are
    of the view that the Adjudicator failed to address the specific  import
    of Article 3; that is the infliction of harm by the receiving state, in
    this case China, such as to  constitute  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading
    treatment.  There was no evidence before the  Adjudicator  as  to  what
    type of ill-treatment the  Appellant  might  be  at  risk  of.   Prison
    conditions in China may be far  from  ideal;   but,  as  stated  by  Mr
    Justice   Collins  in   Fazilat  [2000]  UKIAT  00973,  the  Court   of
    Strasbourg has recognised  that  it  is  not  for  signatories  to  the
    Convention to impose the standards of the Convention on all the  world.
    Recognition has to be had to the situation in individual countries  and
    to the standards that are accepted and expected in those countries.  In
    the circumstances we do not find that the prison conditions  in  China,
    on their own, give rise to a breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.

16.   Furthermore, we would agree that given the close  correlation  between
    Article 3 and asylum claims, and the Tribunal's finding in  Kacaj  that
    an appeal which failed on asylum grounds  would  rarely  succeed  under
    Article 3 on the same facts,  the Adjudicator's decision to allow  this
    appeal under Article 3 was flawed, more particularly in  the  light  of
    his findings in relation to the asylum appeal.

17.   Turning now to the submissions made by Mr Ekagha, there is  no  reason
    for us not to find, in the absence of the  evidence  to  the  contrary,
    that now that the respondent has reached the age of 23, he  is  outside
    the age of military service, and furthermore, he can buy himself out by
    paying a fine.  This means that the respondent does not have to  go  to
    prison and therefore there will be no risk of torture.

18.   Accordingly, the Appellant's appeal is allowed.
