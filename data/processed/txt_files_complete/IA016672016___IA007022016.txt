For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants appeal against the decision of the First  Tier  Tribunal
    (Judge MR Oliver) (FtT) promulgated on  30th  May  2017  in  which  the
    appeal against the respondent's decision refusing their application for
    ILR (long residence based on 10 years) was dismissed. The  respondent's
    decision was made on 20th January 2016.

Background

2.   The appellants are citizens of Pakistan.  The  main  appellant  arrived
    in the UK as a student in 2004 and he married his first wife who was an
    EEA resident. He was granted a family residence permit valid from March
    2011 to March 2016.  They divorced on 1 November 2013.  He applied  for
    permanent residence on 20th December 2013 which was refused. His appeal
    was initially struck out but at the hearing it  was  confirmed  by  the
    Respondent that the appellant had retained a  right  of  residence  and
    that  his  residence  permit  was  valid.  The  appeal  was   withdrawn
    accordingly. He applied in March 2015 on the basis of  long  residence.
    His second wife had joined him in the UK in March 2015.

3.   The respondent refused the long residence application  on  the  grounds
    that the appellant's residence as an EU family  member  did  not  count
    towards his long term residence in the UK under the Immigration  Rules.
    His EEA spouse had not shown that she was qualified  for  the  relevant
    period of time. His new wife could not show that  she  was  married  to
    someone that was settled in the UK.  There  was  no  dispute  that  the
    appellant had leave continuously until 2010.

First tier decision

4.   The FtT accepted the position argued by  the  respondent,  namely  that
    periods of residence under the EEA Regulations could not count  towards
    the Immigration rules [9].  And further found  that  his  ex  wife  had
    failed to show she was working for the period on  which  the  residence
    card was issued [9].  Consideration was given to family life under  the
    Rules and to the best interests of the child which the FtT rejected.

Grounds of appeal

5.   In grounds of appeal  the  appellant  argued  that  the  FtT  erred  by
    failing to treat the appellant as a person with a  right  of  residence
    retained since his  divorce.   The  only  issue  was  evidence  of  the
    appellant working at the time of the  divorce.  The  respondent  has  a
    policy to treat residence under the EEA Regulations as  applying  under
    the Immigration Rules.

Permission to appeal

6.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (UT) was granted on  renewal
    by UTJ Gill.  In granting permission the  UTJ  drew  attention  to  the
    respondent's policy which the FtT had failed to consider.   The  appeal
    was a human rights appeal rather than under EEA Regulations.

Submissions

7.   At the hearing before me Mr Nazim relied on the grounds of  appeal  and
    argued that the appellant had provided the evidence of  his  employment
    at the time of the divorce.  Mr Bramble conceded that the appeal  ought
    to be allowed for the main appellant and that the FtT failed to get  to
    grips with the main issue under appeal.  Mr  Nazim  submitted  that  in
    respect of the second appellant, that as the application was under  the
    old rules it remained possible for the matter to be reconsidered by the
    respondent.

Discussion and conclusion

8.   There is a material error of law in the decision  which  shall  be  set
    aside.  The appellants have made out the grounds of appeal.  There  was
    no dispute as to the error in law. The FtT erred in law by  failing  to
    properly consider the application of residence periods  under  the  EEA
    Regulations with reference to the respondent's policy that such  period
    could count towards residence under the Rules. The appeal was  a  human
    rights matter and not an EEA appeal. There was  evidence  available  to
    the FtT to show that the appellant was self employed as  an  Uber  taxi
    driver at the time of his divorce.  The first appellant has shown  that
    he has 10 years continuous leave in the UK. It was  accepted  that  the
    appellant was married to his wife and that they had a child in the  UK.
    No other issues were raised. Given that the appellant had not  at  this
    stage been granted leave as a settled person, the appeal by his wife as
    a  dependent  remained  to  be  considered   on   that   basis.    Both
    representatives agreed that the matter should be  reconsidered  by  the
    respondent.

Re making

9.   I remake the decision in respect of the first appellant and  allow  the
    appeal.  In respect of  the  second  appellant  the  matter  is  to  be
    reconsidered by the respondent in the light of  the  first  appellant's
    appeal having been allowed.

Decision

10.  Error of law found and the decision is set aside.

    The appeal of the  first  appellant  is  allowed  and  for  the  second
    appellant to be reconsidered by the Secretary of State.

NO ANONYMITY ORDER

As I have allowed the appeal of the first appellant and the issues  were  in

ï¿½100.00.
