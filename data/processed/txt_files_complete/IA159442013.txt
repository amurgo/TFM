For the Respondent:    Mr J Middleton, Counsel, instructed by Leigh Bailey
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  to  whom  I  shall  refer  in  this  determination  as  the
    "claimant".  The respondent is a citizen of India, who was born on 14th
    February, 1986.  On 30th January,  2013  he  made  application  to  the
    claimant for leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  and  for  a
    biometric residence permit.  The respondent's  immigration  history  is
    that he first entered the United Kingdom on  25th  August,  2009,  with
    leave as a student until 31st January, 2011.  On 18th  February,  2011,
    he was granted further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study)  Worker
    with leave granted until 18th February, 2013.  His  application,  which
    is dated 30th January, was actually submitted to the claimant  on  15th
    February, 2013.

2.   The claimant refused the respondent's application, because she was  not
    satisfied that  the  respondent  met  the  requirements  of  the  Rules
    (Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395,  as  amended  ("the
    Rules") as they relate to Appendix A.  No  issue  was  taken  with  the
    respondent's ability to satisfy Appendices B and C.

3.   The  respondent  appealed  and  his  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Simon Batiste at Bradford on 8th October, 2013.

4.   At paragraphs 11 and 12 of his determination, the judge identified  the
    claimant's criticism of the respondent's application.  The  judge  said
    this:

         "11. Firstly it is  claimed  that  the  respondent  has  failed  to
             demonstrate that he has access to �50,000 in  accordance  with
             table A of Appendix  A.   He  claimed  to  have  approximately
             �12,500 in a United Kingdom bank account for which  there  was
             no problem and a further �40,000 in a joint bank account  that
             he held with his father at  the  State  Bank  of  India.   The
             reason for the refusal is that a third party  letter  that  he
             relies upon does not demonstrate that he has access  to  their
             funds.  I do not accept this.  The documents  at  pages  30-32
             include a letter from the  bank  holding  the  relevant  funds
             indicating that the respondent and his father hold  the  funds
             in that account jointly.  Furthermore, at page 31 there  is  a
             letter from the father indicating that the funds are available
             to the respondent, and at 32 there is a letter from  a  lawyer
             confirming that he has witnessed the  signature  and  verified
             the father's identity.   Having  considered  these  documents,
             that I accept  were  submitted  with  the  application,  I  am
             satisfied that the respondent met the requirements with regard
             to these monies according to the Rule as was in  existence  at
             the date  of  application,  as  were  kindly  provided  by  Mr
             Paramore.  I therefore find that the respondent does meet this
             requirement and did produce satisfactory documentation at  the
             date of application.


         12.  The second issue related to the requirement  within  the  Rule
             that the respondent provide  one  or  more  contracts  showing
             trading.  It is conceded by the respondent  that  he  did  not
             provide any such certificates with the application.  In  fact,
             he indicated at  G23  of  the  application  in  reply  to  the
             question 'you must provide one  or  more  contracts  for  work
             demonstrating trading' that no contracts  had  been  supplied.
             The respondent has subsequently  supplied  a  contract  for  a
             later period than this, but given the restrictions  under  the
             Rule I can take no account of this.  I was told that his  main
             contract at the time  was  with  the  Cumbria  and  Lancashire
             Commissioning Service of the NHS.  However, since the  changes
             made to the NHS that body has now been abolished and  replaced
             by others.  As a result he is  no  longer  able  to  obtain  a
             contract relating to an organisation that  no  longer  exists.
             He accepts, however, that he failed to provide the contract as
             he did not realise that  it  was  necessary  under  the  Rules
             despite the clear indication in the application form that such
             document was required."  [My emphasis]

5.   The judge went on to  note  that  there  was  an  acceptance  that  the
    respondent could not comply with the Rules.  He quite properly went  on
    to consider the respondent's human rights appeal and Article 8  of  the
    European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental
    Freedoms.   First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Batiste  concluded  that  the
    claimant's  decision  did  form  a  disproportionate  breach   of   the
    respondent's Article 8 rights and he allowed the respondent's appeal.

6.   The claimant, being dissatisfied with the judge's decision,  challenged
    it and permission was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Osborne.
    The grounds of application relied on by the  claimant  suggested  that,
    having allowed the respondent's appeal on human rights  grounds,  after
    having dismissed it under the Immigration Rules,  First  Tier  Tribunal
    Judge Batiste misdirected itself in  law  as  to  what  amounted  to  a
    proportionate interference with private life.  It is suggested  in  the
    grounds that the Tribunal in effect found  that  the  criteria  in  the
    points-based system Rules impose a higher test than the proportionality
    test in Article 8.  Reference was also made to the judgment  of  Burton
    LJ in Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261.

7.   Addressing me today on behalf of the claimant, Ms Johnson told me  that
    she relied on the grounds and suggested that when the judge  looked  at
    the question of private life, he found that the respondent  could  have
    succeeded under the Rules now and allowed the appeal on that basis.  In
    doing so he misdirected  himself.   I  clarified  with  the  Presenting
    Officer whether the judge was entitled to find  any  interference  with
    the respondent's private life and  she  accepted  that  the  judge  was
    entitled, as he had done at paragraph 15, to find that  the  claimant's
    decision amounted to an  interference  and  that  it  would  also  have
    consequences of such gravity as potential  to  engage  Article  8.   At
    paragraph 16 of the determination the judge said:

         "There  are  points  that  do  suggest  that   the   decision   was
         proportionate.  Firstly, the [respondent]  has  only  been  in  the
         United Kingdom for a relatively short  period.   Secondly,  he  has
         failed to comply with the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.
         Thirdly, he has skills that would  inevitably  enable  him  to  re-
         integrate back into Indian society."

     Ms Johnson confirmed that there were no other factors weighing  against
    the respondent that the judge should have considered but had failed  to
    do so.

8.   At paragraph 17 of the determination, the judge said:

         "However, there are points that suggest that the  decision  is  not
         proportionate.  Firstly, the [respondent], while failing to provide
         the documentation necessary to satisfy the Immigration  Rules,  did
         in fact have the necessary skills, finance and contracts that would
         have enabled him to satisfy the Rules if he had  properly  provided
         all the information."

     Ms Johnson confirmed that that was a factually correct statement.

9.   At paragraph 17 of the determination, the judge went on to say:

         "Secondly, he is clearly brining entrepreneurial spirit with him to
         the United Kingdom  and  has  the  potential  to  earn  significant
         amounts of money.  Thirdly, he clearly now does have contracts such
         that he would lose if the decision was found to be proportionate."

     Again, Ms Johnson, fairly and in my view  entirely  properly,  accepted
    that they were findings that the judge was  entitled  to  make  in  the
    circumstances.

10.  At paragraph 18 the judge went on to say:

         "Having considered all the factors I do not consider  the  decision
         to be proportionate.  The prime factor in this decision is that the
         [respondent] would have been able  to  satisfy  the  Rules  and  is
         making a meaningful contribution to British  society.   Given  that
         this is the case I find that the weight that can be attached to any
         legitimate aim of protecting the economic wellbeing of  the  United
         Kingdom is very limited in this case.  The [respondent]  is  not  a
         burden on the public funds.   In  fact,  he  will  be  contributing
         valuable tax revenue such that he is likely to be making a positive
         economic contribution to the United Kingdom.  As such I  find  that
         the decision does breach his Article 8 rights."


     Ms Johnson suggested that that was  where  the  judge  had  misdirected
    himself.  I am afraid I disagree.

11.  This is not a near-miss case of the type referred to by  Burton  LJ  in
    Miah.  This is a case where someone, because of  changes  made  by  his
    potential customers within the NHS, was not in a  position  to  provide
    evidence to show that he had the contracts and so was simply not  in  a
    position to supply them with his application.  But that  did  not  mean
    that he did not have those contracts.  The  bodies  with  whom  he  had
    contracts had disappeared with the changes within  the  NHS  which  had
    been going on at the time and it would have been impossible for him  in
    the circumstances to have provided evidence now, of  the  existence  of
    those contracts at the date of the respondent's application.  The judge
    was entitled to take that into account.  He did not, as the Home Office
    Presenting Officer put it, allow the respondent's  appeal  because  the
    respondent could not demonstrate that he met  the  requirement  of  the
    Rules.  I do not believe that there  is  anything  perverse  about  the
    judge's decision.  It may not have been a decision that  I  would  have
    reached, but that is not the test.  The judge has  reached  a  decision
    that was open to him to make on the evidence before him.  I  find  that
    there is no error in his determination, which will stand.
