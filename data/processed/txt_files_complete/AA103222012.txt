                                   Between

                                    [E E]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr B Price, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant identifies himself as a Bidoon from Kuwait, born on  [  ]
    1988.  The respondent rejected his  asylum  claim  by  letter  dated  9
    November 2012, relying on a Sprakab report and on RB (Somalia):  [2010]
    UKUT 329 (IAC) and [2012] EWCA Civ 277.

 2. Judge David C Clapham dismissed the appellant's appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal by determination promulgated on 4 January 2013.

 3. Both the FtT and the Upper Tribunal refused permission to appeal.

 4. The appellant raised a petition for judicial review  in  the  Court  of
    Session, P834/13.  The parties entered into a joint minute which led to
    an interlocutor of 21 November 2014 reducing the decision of the UT  to
    refuse permission to appeal, and remitting the matter back  to  the  UT
    for further consideration.

 5. While full details and a  copy  of  the  joint  minute  have  not  been
    provided to the UT, the procedure in the Court of  Session  appears  to
    have taken place in light of SSHD v MN and KY [2014] UKSC 30,  judgment
    published on 21 May 2014.

 6. The reason for delay since then is that neither party advised the UT of
    the foregoing  developments  until  a  letter  was  received  from  the
    appellant's current solicitors dated  11  April  2016  (or  perhaps  19
    February 2016; no copy of that earlier letter is on the file.)

 7. The following further steps are as agreed between the  parties  at  the
    case management review hearing on 7 June 2016.

 8. The appellant is granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 9. The decision of the FtT is set aside, on the basis  of  errors  of  law
    which emerge in the light of MN and KY.

10. The decision of the FtT stands only as a record of what was advanced in
    those proceedings.

11. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

12. The SSHD is directed to file with the FtT by 21 June  2016  an  updated
    statement of her reasons for refusing the appellant's asylum claim.

13. The appellant is directed to file with the  FtT  by  5  July  2016  (a)
    updated grounds of appeal, including any grounds under Article 8 of the
    ECHR on which he now seeks to rely, (b) a skeleton  argument,  and  (c)
    any additional evidence on which he seeks to rely, with  the  necessary
    application for that evidence to be admitted.

14. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge David C Clapham.

15. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
