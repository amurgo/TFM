Representation
For the appellant/Secretary of State:   Mr S. Halliday, Home Office
                                  Presenting Officer
For the respondent/claimant:      Mr S. O'Ryan, counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of an adjudicator,
      Ms C.E. Pugh, following a  hearing  in  Bradford  on  19  August  2003
      dismissing the claimant's appeal  under  the  Refugee  Convention  but
      allowing his appeal under the Human Rights Convention.

   2. The claimant is a citizen of Iraq and was born on 1 January 1975.   He
      is 28 years old.  He entered the United Kingdom on  28  November  2000
      avoiding immigration controls but claimed asylum on the same day.

   3. On 24 April 2001, the Secretary of State refused his claim for  asylum
      and made removal directions to  Iraq.   That  decision  permitted  the
      claimant to appeal under section 69 (5) of the Immigration and  Asylum
      Act 1999, which the claimant duly exercised.

   4. The claimant stated that he was put  under  pressure  by  the  PKK  to
      assist them.  He gave conflicting accounts as to whether he  became  a
      member or whether the  PKK  merely  attempted  to  recruit  him.   The
      adjudicator referred to the various accounts in paragraph  15  of  her
      determination.  The KDP patrolled the village in  which  the  claimant
      lived and, on 2 August 1999, KDP members attempted to abduct him.   In
      the ensuing struggle, his shoulder was broken.  He claimed that he was
      taken to the security headquarters where he remained in detention  for
      just under a month.

   5. On 13 October 2000, members of the PKK attempted to  coerce  him  into
      cooperating with them which the  claimant  reluctantly  did.   A  week
      later, the claimant stated that he was about to be apprehended by  the
      KDP for assisting the PKK but managed to escape.

   6. The adjudicator rejected the claimant's account and  did  not  believe
      that he was wanted by the KDP.  If he was, she decided that  he  could
      re-locate to another part of the KAA.  Although, in  paragraph  44  of
      the determination, the adjudicator did not consider it  was  necessary
      for the claimant to return to central  Iraq,  she  concluded  that  it
      remained a possibility to do so.  For these reasons, she dismissed the
      asylum claim.  In addition, she concluded that there was no likelihood
      of a violation of his Article 3 rights and  decided  the  claim  under
      this head in line with the asylum claim.

   7. The adjudicator allowed the Article 8 claim.  The basis for her  doing
      so follows the claimant's marriage to  a  British  national  whom  the
      claimant had met whilst in the  United  Kingdom.   Their  relationship
      commenced in February 2002 and they were living together by May  2002.
      They married in June 2003, as soon as was possible after his wife  was
      able to obtain her divorce.  The adjudicator considered  the  relevant
      case law and reached a sustainable decision that his  wife  could  not
      reasonably be expected to accompany him to Iraq.  She has children  by
      her former marriage, one of whom aged 16 was still  at  college.   She
      had an elderly mother who lived close by.  Her mother relied upon  her
      daughter in various ways.

   8. The principal reason for finding that the claimant's  return  to  Iraq
      would amount to a violation of his Article 8 rights centred  upon  the
      difficulties  in  the  claimant  returning  to  Iraq  and  making   an
      application for leave to enter the United Kingdom as  a  spouse.   The
      adjudicator noted that there was no  functioning  British  Embassy  in
      Iraq and the Presenting Officer told  her  that  all  applications  by
      Iraqi nationals are being handled by the British  Embassy  in  Jordan.
      The adjudicator was informed that  this  would  require  the  claimant
      travelling to Jordan.  Unfortunately, no information was  provided  to
      the adjudicator to assist her in deciding how easy it would be for the
      claimant to travel from Iraq  to  Jordan.   In  paragraph  54  of  the
      determination,  the  adjudicator  decided   that   it   would   be   a
      disproportionate response on the part of the  Secretary  of  State  to
      require this husband to leave his wife and not only to return to  Iraq
      but find a means of travel to Jordan  in  order  to  apply  for  entry
      clearance.  The adjudicator had before her the Tribunal's decision  in
      [2003] UKIAT 00011 J. (Serbia and Montenegro) that dealt with  out-of-
      country  applications  made  from  Kosovo.   Although  there  were  no
      facilities within Kosovo operated by the United Kingdom to manage  the
      grant of visa applications, such applications could  be  processed  in
      neighbouring places.  The absence of such  facilities  in  Kosovo  did
      not, therefore, prohibit the appellant from making an application  for
      leave to enter from outside the jurisdiction.


   9. The adjudicator contrasted this situation with that of  the  claimant.
      She was satisfied that if an application could be made in Jordan,  the
      British  Embassy  would  process  it  properly.   In  the  absence  of
      information as to whether the  claimant  could  make  the  journey  to
      Amman, the adjudicator upheld the claimant's human rights appeal.   In
      so deciding, she considered that the circumstances  where  exceptional
      because the question of sending people back  to  Iraq  was  only  just
      emerging as a possibility after many years.

  10. In Baljit Singh [2002] UKIAT 00660, the appellant applied for leave to
      remain as the fianc� of a British citizen.  It was  accepted  that  he
      and his fianc�e shared a family life together with her two children of
      a previous marriage.  His partner was partially immobile as  a  result
      of an industrial accident and one of the children was in the middle of
      GCSE  examinations.   The  Tribunal  commented  on  the  adjudicator's
      concentration upon whether there were insurmountable obstacles in  the
      way of the family following the appellant to India.  The Tribunal  did
      not criticise the legitimacy of such an approach but focussed  on  the
      consideration  of  the  viable  option  of  making  an  out-of-country
      application for entry clearance as a spouse.   Consideration  to  this
      option was all the more important given the fianc�e's refusal to leave
      the  United  Kingdom.   Such  an  option  was  a  more  immediate  and
      sufficient reason for concluding  that  the  decision  to  remove  was
      proportionate as it did not represent any conclusive disruption of the
      appellant's family  life.   The  appellant  was  not  faced  with  any
      permanent or even long-term exclusion from continuing family  life  in
      the United Kingdom.  The option afforded  the  appellant  a  right  of
      appeal against a refusal and both the decision of the Entry  Clearance
      Officer or Immigration Officer and any subsequent appeal had  the  in-
      built right to require  that  any  decision  was  compliant  with  the
      appellant's human rights.  Thus,  the  existence  of  a  legal  avenue
      abroad is sufficient to render the removal proportionate and  it  will
      only be in exceptional circumstances that the decision will not be so.
       This accords with the decision in the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Mahmood
      [2001] Imm AR 229 that there should be equality of  treatment  between
      those who have entered the United Kingdom and  those  who  apply  from
      abroad or, as Laws LJ said at paragraph 23  of  the  judgment:  "...it
      would be manifestly unfair to other would-be entrants who are  content
      to take their place in the entry clearance queue in their  country  of
      origin."


  11.  Exceptional circumstances were not said to exist where the effect  of
      separation was likely  to  require  the  remaining  spouse  to  become
      dependant on public funds for subsistence, even in a  case  where  the
      remaining spouse was partially disabled.  (See Baljit  Singh  itself.)
      Nor where the separation will result in the appellant losing  his  job
      (as would normally occur), even where there was no guarantee that  the
      same or a similar job would be available on  return.   (See  Mahmood.)
      The Entry Clearance Officer can be expected  to  have  regard  to  the
      appellant's  work-record  as  evidence  of  the  appellant's  and  his
      partner's ability  to  maintain  and  accommodate  themselves  without
      recourse to public funds.  It is not an exceptional circumstance  that
      the appellant runs the risk of failing in  an  application  for  entry
      clearance.  Indeed, it is plainly arguable that Article 8  should  not
      be used as a means of circumventing the provisions of the  Immigration
      Rules.

  12. Exceptional circumstances  may  be  established  where  the  returning
      appellant is  unable  to  make  an  effective  application  for  entry
      clearance from abroad either  because  there  are  no  facilities  for
      making such an  application  in  his  country  of  nationality  or  by
      travelling to a neighbouring country, (Soloot (01/TH/1366) or if there
      is  a   prolonged   delay   rendering   the   period   of   separation
      disproportionate, (Mahmood).

  13. The issue before us now is, therefore, whether the absence of a United
      Kingdom  mission  in  Iraq,  capable  of  considering   and   granting
      applications, prevents the claimant making an  effective  application.
      If  it  does,  the  claimant  will  have  established  an  exceptional
      circumstance.  See, generally,  [2003]  UKIAT  00011  J.  (Serbia  and
      Montenegro).

  14. On 18 September 2003, UK Visas (whose headed notepaper  mentions  both
      the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home  Office)  dealt  with
      entry clearance facilities for Iraqi citizens.  This letter post-dates
      the decision of the adjudicator but is material that we are  bound  to
      take into account.  Under paragraph 28 of the  Immigration  Rules,  HC
      395, applications other than EEA family permits "must be made  to  the
      post in the country or territory where the applicant is  living  which
      has been designated by the Secretary of State to  accept  applications
      for entry clearance  for  that  purpose  and  from  that  category  of
      applicant.  Where there is no such post the applicant  must  apply  to
      the appropriate designated post outside the country or territory where
      he is living."  In  the  case  of  Iraq,  Amman  in  Jordan  has  been
      designated to accept such applications.  The letter goes on  to  state
      that 15 percent of the caseload of the visa section in Amman is  spent
      dealing with Iraqi applications and "Iraqi applications are made every
      day of the week."  Finally, and not surprisingly, the letter concludes
      that the United Kingdom has no jurisdiction over the operation of  the
      borders between Jordan and Iraq and cannot, therefore, regulate  entry
      into Jordan.

  15. Prior to the information contained in this  letter,  the  material  in
      existence at the time the adjudicator made her decision was  contained
      in a bulletin prepared by the Coalition Provisional Authority dated 10
      July 2003 and headed "Passport Update".  This stated:

      "Currently,  Iraq  has  no  capacity  to  issued  passports  or  other
      internationally recognised travel document.  In order to assist  Iraqi
      nationals to travel, the Coalition  Provisional  Authority  (CPA)  has
      taken several actions.


      "On 27 June 2003 CPA Order 16 was signed by Ambassador  Bremer  which,
      in part, cancelled the edict of former President Sadaam  Hussein  that
      limited the period of validity of the "N" serious passports...


      "Additionally, a CPA issued Interim Travel Document that can  be  used
      in lieu of a passport is under review, and procedures for issuing such
      a document are being developed.  It is  anticipated  that  an  Interim
      Travel Document will be available by late July or early August [2003],
      and further information concerning how a person may obtain one will be
      released as soon as it is available.


      "Until then, Iraqi nationals are free  to  travel,  and  international
      travel is possible without a passport.  To  accomplish  this,  persons
      wishing to travel  to  another  country  should  contact  the  nearest
      consular representative of the country they wish to visit to determine
      what requirements they must meet in order to enter that country.  This
      applies to all persons whether they have a passport or not."

  16. The most recent information is contained in a letter from the  Foreign
      and Commonwealth Office dated 10 March 2004 in these terms:


      "This letter  is  confirmed  firstly  that  the  [Iraqi]  Ministry  of
      Interior  Office  issuing  Interim   Travel   Documents   (ITDs)   has
      temporarily suspended issuing ITDs as the delivery of the new batch of
      ITD's has been delayed.  Issuing of ITDs is expected to resume in  2-3
      days.
      "Secondly our Embassy in Jordan has confirmed that the border  between
      Jordan and Iraq is not  closed.   In  the  past  it  has  been  closed
      periodically for security reasons,  but  has  usually  reopened  again
      within 24 hours."


  17. The Tribunal is able to deduce the following from this material:


        a. Iraqi citizens are able to  travel  to  Jordan  either  using  a
           passport issued under the regime of Sadaam Hussein or an Interim
           Travel Document issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority or
           the present Iraqi Ministry of Interior Office.
        b. There is no suggestion  that  the  Jordanian  government  itself
           requires a visa for entry.
        c.  Were  the  Jordanian  government  preventing  Iraqi   nationals
           entering  the  country,  we  would  expect  this  to  have  been
           mentioned.
        d. There is no suggestion that any distinction can be drawn between
           an Iraqi passport holder and an Iraqi national holding  an  ITD.
           There  would  be  very  little  point  in  the   present   Iraqi
           authorities issuing ITDs if they were unable to perform the task
           for  which  they  were  issued,  namely,  the  facilitation   of
           international travel.
        e. From time to time, the border between Jordan  and  Iraq  may  be
           closed for security reasons but this does not prevent travel  to
           Jordan and but may delay it.
        f. The fact that 15 percent of the workload of the British  Embassy
           in Amman is concerned with  Iraqi  applications  indicates  that
           there is a substantial traffic of Iraqi  nationals  into  Jordan
           for the purpose,  at  least  in  part,  of  applying  for  entry
           clearance.


  18. The claimant made a statement dated 12 March 2004 in which  he  stated
      that he did not think that he could  get  a  passport  in  the  United
      Kingdom as there is no Iraqi Embassy.  He added: " An  Iraqi  passport
      is useless, I do not know what I can do with it.  It is very  hard  to
      apply for a passport in Iraqi as there is no interior  ministry."   It
      is apparent from the material that we have  set  out  above  that  the
      claimant is incorrect in his  statement  that  an  Iraqi  passport  is
      useless.  Secondly, he is also incorrect when he says that  there  are
      difficulties in the way of applying for an ITD in Iraq.   We  consider
      that the evidence establishes there is an operating  Ministry  of  the
      Interior Office.


  19. In a statement prepared by Jane Inskip, a trainee solicitor acting  on
      behalf  of  the  claimant,  she  says  that  she  has  spoken   to   a
      representative at the Jordanian Embassy in London on 10 February  2004
      and that he told her that an Iraqi national who wishes to enter Jordan
      can do so using only a valid Iraqi passport.  It is not  clear  to  us
      what the official in the Embassy meant by a valid Iraqi passport.   If
      it means either a passport issued by the former regime in Iraq  or  an
      ITD, such a restriction would not prevent the claimant from travelling
      to Jordan.  If  it  means  that  the  Jordanian  government  does  not
      recognise ITDs issued by the present Iraqi Provisional  Authority,  we
      would expect that this to have been mentioned in the material from the
      Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  Indeed, were this  to  be  true,  it
      would undermine the very reason for introducing a system of ITDs.

  20. Mr O'Ryan, who appeared on behalf of the claimant, submitted that  the
      journey  to  Jordan  is  likely  to  fail  because  of   a   lack   of
      infrastructure by which we take it to mean that no travel is  possible
      between the two countries.  He referred us to the Travel Advice of  26
      January 2004 issued by the Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Office  to  the
      effect that travel by road is dangerous, and there have  been  attacks
      against civilians as well as military  convoys.   There  has  been  an
      increase in the use of Improvised Explosive Devices  (IEDs)  on  roads
      throughout Iraq.  Terrorists are targeting aircraft operating in  Iraq
      and travel by civil aviation should be avoided.  (See  the  claimant's
      supplementary bundle, section B4.)  In addition, he referred to an  e-
      mail sent by Mr Twigg from the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office  dated
      10 February 2004 in which he said:

      "Whilst we cannot offer specific advice on the dangers  of  travelling
      on the Baghdad-Amman highway in particular,  the  travel  advice  does
      warn of an "increase in the use of IEDs  on  roads  throughout  Iraq."
      The advice  also  notes  that  "there  is  a  continuing  threat  from
      kidnappings car-jackings and robbery." '"


  21. The same problem  is  also  referred  to  in  the  Country  Assessment
      prepared by CIPU in October 2002 which states at paragraph 2.18:


      "However, there are regular reports of car-jackings and  robberies  on
      Iraqi's roads, in particular  the  highway  between  Baghdad  and  the
      Jordan border.  This appears to have little impact on the high  levels
      of traffic and trade along the road.  Jordanian taxis,  which  in  the
      immediate post-war period charged as much as US $2000 for the  journey
      from Amman to Baghdad, were by mid-July doing the trip  for  US  $200.
      "Amman's markets were cleared of goods and second-hand cars for resale
      in Baghdad by traders  taking  advantage  of  the  absence  of  import
      duties.  In early December 2003, at least 400 Jordanian truck  drivers
      stopped carrying goods  to  Iraq  after  a  series  of  robberies  and
      kidnappings in which seven trucks went missing, etc"


      There are a number of other documents in the  claimant's  bundle  from
      Reuters and other news agencies to the effect  that  travel  from  the
      Iraqi capital overland may be hazardous.


  22. Although Mr O'Ryan conceded that it is possible to obtain  an  ITD  in
      Iran, he submitted  that  the  evidence  fails  to  establish  such  a
      document can be used for the effective purpose of  travel  to  Jordan.
      For the reasons we have given above, we do not consider that ITDs  are
      ineffective.


  23. Whilst we accept the background  evidence  establishes  there  may  be
      dangers  involved  for  those  travelling  from  Baghdad   to   Amman,
      (especially for western journalists and coalition soldiers), we do not
      consider it establishes the reasonable likelihood  that  the  claimant
      cannot make the journey without adverse consequences or a violation of
      his human rights.  Mr O'Ryan accepted that there are large  number  of
      persons making the journey.  We do not accept, however, his submission
      that they were making it by accepting too great a risk.

  24. Furthermore, the background material deals with  travel  by  air  from
      Baghdad to Amman.  Amongst the documents set out in the  supplementary
      bundle submitted by the Secretary of State is a copy of  the  British-
      Danish Fact Finding Report on Iraq of July 2003.  On page  16  of  the
      report (page 207 of the bundle), the section on exit and entry of Iraq
      by airlines contains this information:

      "According to international sources in  Amman,  more  than  600  Iraqi
      citizens legally cross the borderline between Iraq and  Jordan  daily.
      According to an Embassy in  Amman  2000-3000  individuals  passed  the
      border on a daily basis.  According to the  same  sources  Iraqis  can
      enter Jordan without a visa and stay in the  country  for  up  to  six
      months (initially three months and  extendable  for  a  further  three
      months).  On leaving Jordan the Jordanian  authorities  check  whether
      the traveller has overstayed in Jordan.  The head of department at the
      Jordanian Ministry  of  the  Interior  informed  the  delegation  that
      overstayers have to pay a fine of JD 1� (approx US$ 2) per  overstayed
      day when leaving the country.  For humanitarian reasons the  Jordanian
      authorities more often than not refrain  from  collecting  this  fine,
      however it will be collected if the individual re-enters Jordan.   The
      debtors name will be registered on the  computer  of  the  immigration
      authorities.


      "The Jordanian Ministry of the Interior later informed the  delegation
      that Iraqi citizens would be able to enter Jordan  from  abroad,  i.e.
      from a European country, without being met with a visa  request.   The
      airline "Royal Jordanian" despite the embargo has  re-established  the
      flight route Amman-Baghdad-Amman operating six trips a week.  An Iraqi
      citizen would be able to travel from a  European  country  to  Baghdad
      transiting Amman airport without being met with a  visa  request  from
      the Jordanian authorities.


      "An Embassy in Amman confirmed that "Royal  Jordanian"  on  an  almost
      daily basis has a flight route Amman-Baghdad-Amman and added that  the
      route was popular among Iraqi and Jordanian businessmen and  diplomats
      from some western countries."

  25.  Although this suggests the route is most frequently used by diplomats
      and businessman, we are not prepared to infer  that  the  cost  is  so
      prohibitive as to render its use by the claimant impossible.   In  any
      event,  when  considering  issues  in  relation  to  Article   8   and
      proportionality, the cost to the appellant is rarely considered to  be
      a decisive factor by the Tribunal.

  26. For these reasons, we consider that there is a viable option available
      to the claimant to return to Iraq and apply for entry clearance  as  a
      spouse.  Although this will  involve  travel  to  Jordan,  we  do  not
      consider that the difficulties are such as to render the  decision  of
      the Secretary of State disproportionate.  At  the  conclusion  of  the
      appeal, we gave our decision to allow the appeal of the  Secretary  of
      State.  We have now set out our reasons for doing so.


Decision:  The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.
