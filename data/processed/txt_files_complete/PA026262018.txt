Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 5th March 1961.

2.   The appellant entered the United Kingdom as a visitor in 2001.  He  had
    leave in that capacity and as a  student  until  30th  September  2002.
    Thereafter he remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  A  number  of
    applications for leave to remain were made and refused  and  eventually
    he was served with removal directions on 8th August 2017.

3.   Thereafter he applied for asylum or other protection which was  refused
    in a decision of 9th February 2018.

4.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge James for hearing on 6th November
    2018.

5.   It was  indicated  at  that  hearing  that  the  claim  for  asylum  or
    humanitarian protection was not to be proceeded with but rather that it
    was an appeal with a focus essentially upon the appellant's private and
    family life and Article 8 of the ECHR.  The focus of that consideration
    was the appellant's relationship with Ms [H], it being  contended  that
    they were partners within the meaning  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    there would be very significant obstacles to life together in  Jamaica.
     Reliance was placed upon GEN.1.2 Appendix FM.

6.   The Judge concluded that the  appellant  and  Ms  [H]  were  not  in  a
    partnership  found  under  the  Rules  or  indeed  in   any   committed
    relationship akin to marriage and the appeal was dismissed  in  respect
    of human rights.

7.   The appellant sought to challenge  that  decision  essentially  on  two
    grounds:-


         the first being that by reason  of  certain  remarks  made  at  the
         hearing that the Judge was predisposed not to find cohabitation  or
         family life as between the appellant and Ms [H];


         secondly that in the determination of the evidence, the Judge  went
         beyond the proper  scope  of  her  enquiries  raising  new  issues,
         concerns which had not been raised by the respondent.


8.   Permission to appeal the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted.
    Thus the matter comes before me to determine the issues.

9.   The issue of bias or prejudgment arises from a witness statement of  Mr
    Malik, who was the Counsel briefed to act on behalf of the appellant at
    the hearing.

10.  It is noted in the statement as follows at paragraph 6:-

         "At the outset of the hearing, in the absence of Mr Lindsay and  Ms
         [H], the Learned Judge had a preliminary discussion with myself and
         Ms Chopra.  During the course of that exchange, the  Judge  made  a
         remark - directed at myself - to the effect that  having  read  the
         appellant's bundle, it appeared to her that Mr Lindsay might be  Ms
         [H]'s 'carer' as opposed to being in a relationship  with  her  and
         thus being her 'partner' for the purposes of Appendix FM.


         I responded to the effect simply  that  I  had  noted  the  Learned
         Judge's remark."

11.  The Counsel went on to  indicate  that  he  found  that  remark  to  be
    slightly unusual.  The hearing commenced, Mr Lindsay gave his  evidence
    as did Ms [H].  Mr Malik in the statement states "in her questioning of
    Ms [H], the Learned Judge rather forcibly stated Ms  [H]  'I  think  Mr
    Lindsay is your carer' followed by words to the  effect  of  'is  there
    anything that you want to say about that'".   Mr  Malik  seemed  to  be
    surprised at that matter and formed the impression that the  Judge  was
    predisposed to believe that Mr Lindsay and Ms  [H]'s  relationship  was
    not genuine.  His perception was that the remark  itself  created  that
    impression. He said that both Mr Lindsay and Ms [H] were upset  at  the
    conclusion of the  hearing  considering  that  the  Learned  Judge  had
    already made up her mind.

12.   There  is  some  reference  to  the  preliminary  discussion  in   the
    determination itself in the context of paragraphs 29 to 31 thereof.

13.  The Judge comments as follows:-


         "29. The appellant's bundle of documents appeared to  be  the  same
             bundle submitted  for  the  judicial  review  proceedings  and
             contained a significant number of  documents  which  were  not
             relevant to this appeal.  There were also numerous  duplicated
             documents which was unhelpful.


         30.  In particular I noted that  the  judicial  review  proceedings
             findings by UT Judge  Kamara  dated  22nd  March  2017,  which
             reiterated the finding that the appellant's asylum  claim  was
             certified.  However the  Judge  noted  in  his  decision  'the
             respondent now concedes that the appellant  supplied  evidence
             to support his claimed relationship'.  This was discussed with
             the legal representatives prior to the hearing commenced and I
             noted that I would consider all matters if oral  evidence  was
             to be adduced regarding the relationship,  as  per  under  the
             Immigration Rules, as well as the written  evidence  including
             this point.


         31.  It was confirmed at the beginning  of  the  hearing  that  the
             asylum claim was not  to  be  pursued  or  any  medical  based
             Article 3 claim.  The focus of the appeal was to be on private
             and family life under the Rules and Article 8 ECHR."


14.  Thereafter the Judge commences what seems to me to be a  very  detailed
    analysis of the evidence that was  presented  to  support  the  claimed
    relationship.

15.  In terms of documentation put forward to  establish  that  relationship
    that was considered by the Judge at paragraphs 34 to 36.  It was  noted
    that most  of  the  documents  presented,  such  as  utility  bills  or
    correspondence, were addressed singularly and that there were very  few
    documents to suggest any  form  of  intertwined  financial  arrangement
    between the couple.  The Judge made the comment that such documents may
    confirm that they reside at the same property but not necessarily in  a
    relationship.

16.  The Judge then considered in some detail what was said as  regards  the
    length of that relationship and when it was said to have started as set
    out particularly in paragraph 37 of the determination.   It  was  noted
    that there  were  significant  and  contradictory  statements  on  that
    matter.  The appellant would seem to have given various accounts of the
    commencement of that relationship from 2005  to  2008  whereas  Ms  [H]
    claimed to have been in a relationship since 2002.  She was  unable  to
    identify which year she met him or the year in  which  they  cohabited.
    When pressed on the matter she contradicted herself claiming  that  she
    met him in 2008 and that the relationship commenced in 2010.

17.  Ms [H] seemingly claimed that the appellant  had  no  income  save  for
    food paid for by herself, seeming unaware that he had been working  for
    family and friends.

18.  The appellant claimed that  he  had  cohabited  with  her  from  up  to
    thirteen years, no-one else had resided in the property when  he  lived
    with her.   Where Ms [H] initially claimed that no-one else resided  at
    her home, she then indicated that her son resided with her and then  at
    some stage and then her grandson lived in the  spare  bedroom  and  had
    done so for a few years.  He confirmed that the spare room was used  by
    her grandchildren.  They have spent weekends with her.  Various letters
    were referred to giving different dates as  to  when  the  relationship
    began.

19.  The Judge gives some allowance for illiteracy and a lack  of  cognitive
    ability as regards memory but did not find that the contradictions  and
    discrepancies assist the appellant in establishing that relationship.

20.  It was noted also that in the witness statement of the appellant  dated
    12th March 2018 he confirms that he met a Ms Smith  in  2008  and  they
    cohabited  in  December  2011.   In  the  bundle  was  found  a   birth
    certificate for Susan Ann Smith. In oral evidence the appellant  denied
    knowing such a person.  The Judge was sensitive to the fact that, given
    the dates of birth, it may be that Ms [H] and Ms Smith  were  the  same
    person. It was undermining of the appellant's credibility that  he  did
    not seem to accept that.

21.  A number of letters from relatives in support of the  appellant  seemed
    to make no reference to the relationship with Ms [H].

22.  In evidence Ms  [H]  accepted  that  she  was  in  receipt  of  welfare
    benefits and lived in a three bedroomed house, her  grandson  regularly
    visiting and staying but the appellant however claimed  it  was  a  two
    bedroom property and nobody  had  lived  at  that  address  other  than
    himself and Ms [H] throughout the duration  of  the  relationship.   In
    terms of the d�cor of the bedroom which the appellant claims  to  share
    with Ms [H] the appellant gave  a  detailed  description  of  wallpaper
    whereas Ms [H] stated that it was painted.

23.  Taking all those matters together the conclusion of  the  appellant  as
    to the relationship is set out at paragraph 38:


         "In assessing this contradictory information evidence in regards to
         the  claimed  relationship  with  the  couple,  its  duration   and
         cohabitation, taking the totality of the evidence  before  me  into
         account, on balance I am not persuaded that this couple are  indeed
         in a relationship.  On the contrary I find that at  best  they  are
         friends who reside in the same  shared  accommodation  of  a  three
         bedroomed house, and that it is possible  that  the  appellant  has
         provided with such accommodation in order to aid Ms [H] around  the
         house and be supplied with accommodation and food in return.  I  do
         not find this is a relationship, or that it is  a  genuine  one  or
         subsisting.  Thus the appellant fails to  meet  the  definition  of
         partner under the Rules, or any other  family  criteria  under  the
         Rules or ECHR Article 8 in regards  to  Ms  [H]  concerning  family
         life."


24.  I find that to be a finding properly open to the Judge given the  basis
    of concern as so clearly set out in the determination.

25.  The aspect of the appellant being the potential carer of Ms [H]  arises
    indeed from the evidence which  both  have  given  as  to  her  medical
    problems.   She  claims  that  she  requires  daily  support  from  the
    appellant such as she is unable to wash herself or dress or  stand  for
    long periods or walk.  Ms [H] sets out a number of her conditions.

26.  Little medical evidence has been provided to support such a  contention
    and indeed the Judge noted that, despite the difficulties  claimed,  Ms
    [H] had walked unaided to board a bus, train and tube to the hearing.

27.  The appellant in his statement claimed that he  cleans,  washes,  shops
    and cooks and takes Ms [H] to hospital and  reminds  her  to  take  her
    medication.

28.  The Judge notes that it such is perhaps  difficult  to  reconcile  with
    the wish of the appellant to work.  The Judge came  to  the  conclusion
    that the evidence of such  dependency  is  not  reliable.  It  was  not
    accepted that Ms [H] is as dependent on the appellant or  requires  his
    presence to the extent that is claimed.

29.  The Judge significantly noted at  paragraph  48  of  the  determination
    that a Miss Gillespie, a cousin of  the  appellant  confirms  that  the
    appellant spends weekends with her and her family and that  family  and
    friends help him out financially.  He wishes  to  work  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  It is noted that she failed to refer to any relationship with
    Ms [H] or Ms Smith.  The evidence of various other people, such  as  Mr
    Bennett and Mr Wallace, are also considered  in  the  overall  context.
    Thus the focus of the Judge's consideration was whether  the  appellant
    cohabits with Ms [H] and if he does on what basis.

30.  In terms of bias or perceived bias I  find  no  basis  to  uphold  that
    challenge.

31.  The Judge had read the papers in advance  and  it  is  clear  that  the
    issue of whether the appellant was a carer for Ms  [H]  rather  than  a
    partner was something that clearly emerged as a matter of concern.

32.  I find nothing improper in  the  Judge  raising  that  issue  with  the
    parties or the representatives in  advance,  it  is  often  helpful  to
    highlight what might be a potential issue in order  that  it  could  be
    dealt with.

33.  In terms of the questioning of Ms [H] it is entirely right  and  proper
    as I so find for the Judge to give Ms [H] the opportunity of responding
    to that concern.  Indeed it would have been open to criticism  had  the
    Judge made that remark in the determination without  having  raised  it
    either with the parties or with the appellant and Ms [H] giving them an
    opportunity of addressing it.

34.  When looked at as a whole the  determination  is  a  careful  one  that
    gives no indication of bias.  The evidence  has  been  very  fully  and
    fairly considered.  The matters in favour of the relationship have been
    stated as well as the matters that indicate to the contrary.

35.  The further challenge is that in considering the  matter  of  carer  at
    all, or indeed in seeking to analyse the nature  of  the  relationship,
    the Judge went beyond that which was required.

36.  Mr Mannan contends that the nature of the  relationship  was  never  in
    issue but only its duration.

37.  In terms of the respondent's decision  itself  of  9th  February  2018.
    such matter is considered in paragraphs 86 onwards.  It was  considered
    that documents presented did not confirm that the appellant and Ms  [H]
    had been living together at the address for two years or more.  It  was
    noted from the asylum claim, that the appellant claims to have been  in
    a relationship for eleven, twelve or thirteen years whereas before  the
    appellant was unable to confirm how long the relationship had been for.
     It was noted that the appellant was unable to confirm the date of  her
    birth or to provide information regarding  this  relationship  with  Ms
    [SH].

38.  It seems to me quite clear from the nature of the decision there was  a
    lack of detail as to the duration of the relationship and indeed a lack
    of detail as to his knowledge of his claimed partner.   The credibility
    of the account of that relationship was  clearly  under  challenge.   I
    find it was entirely open  to  the  Judge  in  those  circumstances  to
    conduct the enquiry which was carried out.  The task of the Judge is to
    consider the evidence as to when the relationship started and what  its
    nature is.  That I find  was  properly  embarked  upon  by  the  Judge.
    Though the decision letter does not make reference to the potential  of
    the appellant being a carer  it  is  entirely  open  to  the  Judge  to
    consider that possibility, particularly as evidence  was  presented  by
    both appellant and Ms [H] as to the dependency and their  need  one  or
    the other.

39.  I find that the determination of the Judge is a careful,  thorough  and
    fair determination which effectively deals with  the  issues  that  are
    presented.  I find no error of law in approach or in detail.

40.  In the circumstances the appellant's appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal
    is dismissed.  The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  shall  stand
    namely that the appeal stands dismissed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
