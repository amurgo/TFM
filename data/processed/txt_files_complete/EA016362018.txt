Representation:
For the Appellant:     unrepresented but Mr Miguel [P] addressed the
                    Tribunal on his behalf
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay (on 12th July 2019); Mr T Melvin (on
                    31st October 2019), Senior Home Office Presenting
                    Officers


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Tribunal adjourned consideration of the appellant's  appeal  to
         permit written submissions to be made by both parties.

      2. The appellant is not the biological son of Mr Miguel [P], according
         to a DNA test undertaken in connection with his application for  an
         EEA family permit to join who he thought was his father.  Following
         the hearing on 31st October we took the  view  that  the  issue  of
         whether this appellant should be treated as a family  member  under
         regulation 7 was not straightforward. Mr Melvin agreed  to  provide
         written submissions within 7 days - which he did -  and  thereafter
         Mr Miguel [P] had leave to file written submissions within  7  days
         thereafter - which he did not. We had informed the parties that  we
         would take a decision on the basis of the submissions made  without
         a further hearing, which we now proceed to do.

      3. Mr Miguel [P] is not himself an EU citizen; he is the spouse of  an
         EU national who is  exercising  Treaty  rights  and  has  a  permit
         accordingly. The appellant has been treated  for  all  intents  and
         purposes by Mr [P] as his son  since  his  birth.  The  appellant's
         siblings have been acknowledged as direct blood relatives to Mr [P]
         and their appeals against the refusal of EEA  family  permits  were
         allowed by us following the hearing on 31st October.

      4. The respondent does not accept the appellant is or was a member  of
         the household of the Union Citizen or was dependant  on  the  Union
         Citizen but does accept that some financial remittances  were  sent
         by the appellant's father to the appellant's mother. It is  correct
         that the appellant has not and does not reside in the household  of
         the EU citizen - he resides with his mother in Guinea-Bissau.

      5. Although the appellant has been treated by Mr [P] as his son, he is
         not and has never been a family member of Mr [P]'s spouse - who  is
         the EU citizen. He has never lived in the same household and is not
         and has not - on the evidence before us - been  dependent  on  her.
         She does not, again  on  the  evidence  before  us,  have  parental
         responsibility for the appellant. Neither the Regulations  nor  the
         Directive enable family permits to be issued to  a  person  in  the
         situation of the appellant.

      6. It may be that the circumstances are such that an application under
         the Immigration Rules could succeed. But it is not possible for  us
         to reach a decision on that not only  because  there  has  been  no
         application for such a visa but also there is insufficient evidence
         provided  to  enable  consideration  to  be  given   to   such   an
         application.

      7. We dismiss the appellant's appeal against the refusal of  a  family
         permit.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    We set aside the decision and re-make the decision  in  the  appeal  by
    dismissing it

                                    Date 9th December 2019
