For the Appellants     Mr T Chowdhury, Solicitor, Kingdom Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh.  They applied for  leave  to
    remain in the UK as the spouse and children of the sponsor,  Mr.  Ataur
    Rahman, under paragraphs 284 and 298 respectively  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The respondent refused their applications on 3 June  2014.   In
    respect of the lead appellant, the respondent was  not  satisfied  that
    there was adequate accommodation  and  maintenance  without  access  to
    public funds, and that at the time of the refusal the English  language
    test certificate and qualifications did not appear on the  respondent's
    approved list of Providers.  The  respondent  was  not  satisfied  that
    Fouziha Rahman met the requirements of the Immigration Rules and taking
    into account Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act
    2009, family life of all the appellants could continue in Bangladesh.

2.    The  appellants'  appeals  against  the  respondent's  decision   were
    dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Moore  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 26  August  2015.   The  appellants  have  been  granted
    permission to appeal the judge's decision.

2.   The judge found that Mrs Fateha Rahman on 17  March  2014  applied  for
    further leave to remain in the UK as the  spouse  of  Mr  Attar  Rahman
    under  the  transitional  arrangements.  In  those  circumstances   the
    Immigration Rules that were in effect as of 5 March 2014 were  relevant
    and effective.  The judge  said  it  was  clear  by  reference  to  the
    definition of  "public  funds"  in  the  Immigration  Rules  that  were
    effective as of 5 March 2014, that tax credit and housing benefits  are
    public fund payments, and therefore he should take such  payments  into
    account in determining the issue regarding public funds  and  therefore
    subsequent recourse to any such public  funds.  Consequently  he  found
    that tax credits amounting to �187.01 per week and  additional  housing
    benefit payments must mean that there would be recourse to public funds
    and in those circumstances the maintenance requirement under the  Rules
    cannot be satisfied.

3.   The judge added for clarity that there was  no  issue  with  regard  to
    entitlement to claim tax credit or housing benefit, but rather,  having
    made such claims for such benefits  successfully,  those  payments  are
    public  funds  and  will  be  taken  into  account  by  him.   In   the
    circumstances it would appear  to  be  the  case  that  the  appellants
    resided in accommodation that could  only  be  maintained  through  the
    receipt of public funds.  Therefore in the absence of such benefits the
    appellants  would  be  wholly  unable  to  maintain   and   accommodate
    themselves without access to public funds.  Consequently he found  that
    paragraph 284(vii) and (viii) of the Rules cannot be met.

4.   The judge noted that Mrs. Fateha Rahman had only recently submitted  an
    ESOL certificate which was issued on 5 March 2015, which on the face of
    it was  an  authentic  award.  He  could  not  however  go  behind  the
    submission made by Miss Barrow for the Home Office submitted  that  the
    respondent had not had time to undertake enquiries to ascertain whether
    it was on the approval list by the Secretary of State.

6.   The judge found that the appellant did not meet Appendix FM,  paragraph
    EX.1 as there were no  exceptional  circumstances,  having  taken  into
    account all the evidence that was before him. He accepted that the lead
    appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with both  her  son
    and daughter.  Both children are Bangladeshi nationals. Neither of  the
    children has lived in the UK for more than 7 years.  Master  Rahman  is
    only 4 years old and entered the UK on 28 December 2011.  Miss  Fouziha
    Rahman is 19 years old but did not enter the UK until 21 October 2012.

7.   The judge's  other  findings  in  relation  to  paragraph  298  of  the
    Immigration  Rules,  Section  55  of  the  Borders,   Citizenship   and
    Immigration Act 2009 and Article 8 were challenged in the  grounds  but
    permission to argue those issues was refused by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    King.

8.   UTJ King granted permission as follows:

         "On the issue of maintenance under  the  Immigration  Rules  it  is
         arguable that the issue is not whether the spouse is in receipt  of
         public funds but whether  as  a  result  of  the  presence  of  the
         applicant and child such will be increased.  The  determination  is
         far from clear on whether the  applicant  will  be  in  receipt  of
         public funds.  The  calculations  did  not  make  that  clear.   No
         findings are made on  the  overcrowding  issue  or  indeed  whether
         indeed the language certificate now complies with the Rules.


         So far as matters concerning EX.2 and Article 8 I do not  find  any
         arguable error of law."


9.   Mr Chowdhury argued as he  did  in  his  grounds  that  'regarding  tax
    credit, we submit that the parties, especially the sponsor, is entitled
    to tax credit and it will not be considered as public funds'."

9.   He cited Regulation 3(1) of the Tax Credits  (Immigration)  Regulations
    2003, which says that "No person is entitled to  child  tax  credit  or
    working tax  credit  while  he  is  a  person  subject  to  immigration
    control".  Mr Choudhury relied on  the  exception  in  Regulation  3(2)
    which states

         "Where one member of a married couple  or  unmarried  couple  is  a
         person subject to immigration control, and the other member is  not
         ... shall, subject to paragraph (3), be determined in the same  way
         as if that person were not subject to such control."

10.  In light of the exception in Regulation 3(2), Mr Chowdhury argued  that
    the judge ought to have accepted that  the  appellant  is  entitled  to
    receive public funds.  He also placed reliance on paragraph 6B  of  the
    Immigration Rules which states:

         "6B Subject to paragraph 6C, a person (P) shall not be regarded  as
             having recourse to public  funds  and  if  P  is  entitled  to
             benefits specified under Section 115 of  the  Immigration  and
             Asylum  Act  1999  by  virtue  of   Regulations   made   under
             subsections (3) and (4) of that Section or Section 42  of  the
             Tax Credits Act 2002".

11.  Mr Chowdhury submitted that by virtue of Section 42 of the Tax  Credits
    Act 2002 the appellant is  entitled  to  tax  credit;  accordingly  the
    appellant is not having recourse to public funds as found by the  judge
    at paragraph 26 of his judgment.  If the appellant is found to have  no
    recourse to public funds, she meets the requirements of maintenance and
    accommodation under the Immigration Rules and so  the  appeals  of  all
    three appellants should be allowed.

12.  I find that Mr Chowdhury has misconstrued  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    the Tax Credits (Immigration) Regulations 2003.  The  Regulations  were
    made  by the Treasury in exercise of the powers conferred upon them  by
    Sections 42 and 65(1), (3), (7) and (9) of the Tax Credits Act 2002(a).
     Regulation 3 is headed "Exclusion of Persons  subject  to  Immigration
    Control from Entitlement to Tax  Credits".   Therefore  Mr  Chowdhury's
    reliance on Regulations  3(1)  and  (2)  is  misconceived  because  the
    appellants are subject to immigration control  and  as  such  they  are
    excluded from entitlement to tax credits.  Regulation  3(1)  identifies
    five cases as exceptions to that Rule.  On the evidence the  appellants
    do not fall into any of those five exceptions.

13.  Therefore under paragraph 6B of the Immigration Rules and Regulation  3
    of the Tax Credits (Immigration) Regulations 2003  the  appellants  are
    excluded from claiming tax credits.

14.  I accept Mr Chowdhury's argument that the sponsor,  Mr  Ataur,  who  is
    settled in the UK, is entitled to tax credit and that this  should  not
    be taken into account when considering the public funds element of this
    case.  In the circumstances the issue that the judge  had  to  consider
    was whether as a result of the presence of the appellants, there  would
    be additional recourse to public funds as defined in  paragraph  6A  of
    the Immigration Rules.  It was not clear from  the  determination  that
    the judge considered this issue or made a finding on it.  Consequently,
    I find that the judge erred in law.

15.  As there was sufficient evidence before me, I proceeded to  remake  the
    decision.

16.  Mr. Chowdhury submitted a schedule of the income of the family.  Before
    the appellants arrived in the UK Mr Ataur Rahman was in self-employment
    earning �302.50 per week, amounting to �1,310.93 a month.  He  received
    housing benefit of �62 per week, amounting to �322.40 per month.   This
    housing benefit element is public funds.

17.  It appears from the schedule of total income of  the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant (which I presume to be the leading appellant) at the time  of
    the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  fallen  below  the
    sponsor's earnings prior to  the  arrival  of  the  appellants.   Their
    income was now �219.78 net per month, totalling �952.40 per month. They
    received tax credit in the  sum  of  �183.16  per  week,  amounting  to
    �793.70 per month and an increase in housing benefit to  �85  per  week
    amounting to �370 per month. I find that in the light of the receipt of
    tax credit and the increase in housing benefit, the  appellants  cannot
    satisfy the Immigration Rules as they are  not  able  to  maintain  and
    accommodate themselves without  increased  or  additional  recourse  to
    public funds.

Notice of Decision

18.  The appeals of the appellants are dismissed.
