For the Appellant:     Mr Markus, Counsel instructed by the Greater
                    Manchester Immigration Aid Unit
For the Respondent:    Ms Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a female national  of  Iraq  born  in  1989.  She  has
    permission[1] to appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Designated Judge McClure)[2] to dismiss her  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds[3].

    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The Appellant seeks leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  basis
    of her relationship with her husband, BA. BA is an Iranian national who
    has lived in the United Kingdom since 2008.  He  was  recognised  as  a
    refugee in March 2010. Shortly  after  being  granted  that  status  he
    travelled to the Kurdish area of Iraq in order to visit his family.  In
    Sulamaniyyah he was introduced to the Appellant.  They  became  engaged
    and in 2011  he  travelled  to  Syria  where  they  were  married.  The
    Appellant applied for entry clearance as his spouse  and  on  the  23rd
    November 2011 she was granted a visa under the terms of paragraph  319M
    of the Immigration  Rules.    That  leave  was  valid  until  the  23rd
    February 2014.


 3. On the 27th January 2014 the Appellant applied to vary that leave so as
    to extend it. The application was refused by way of letter  dated  23rd
    April 2014. The Respondent noted that  the  Appellant  had  been  given
    leave to enter under the 'old Rules' that is  to  say  those  rules  in
    place prior to  the  9th  July  2012.    The  Appellant  was  therefore
    required to show that she met the requirements of paragraph 284 of  the
    Rules. This she could not do because neither she or her husband were in
    employment, and as a refugee with limited leave to remain  BA  was  not
    "settled".

 4. The Appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  human  rights
    grounds.



    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The determination recognises that the Appellant  cannot  succeed  under
    the old Immigration Rules for the reasons advanced by  the  Respondent.
    The determination then proceeds to consider Razgar Article 8.


 6. By the time that the appeal was heard in September 2014  the  Appellant
    had given birth to two children, the first born in  December  2012  and
    the second in August 2014.  The Tribunal  accepted  that  there  was  a
    family life between the Appellant, her husband and child and  that  the
    Article  is  engaged  by   the   decision.   In   its   assessment   of
    proportionality the  Tribunal  weighs  the  following  factors  in  the
    balance:

        . The Appellant could meet  neither  the  old  rules  nor  the  new
          provisions in Appendix FM/276ADE


        . She fails in part because her husband has "chosen" to give up his
          job in Birmingham. Although he claimed that he  was  not  fit  to
          work as a result of illness there was no evidence of this and the
          family are now entirely dependent upon benefits

        . The children are young and could "easily adapt to life in Iraq"

        . Sulaymaniyyah is under the control of the Kurdish group  and  the
          family would therefore have no problem in relocating there

        . The Appellant has family members still living in Sulamaniyyah

        . The children have no medical issues

 7. All of these factors lent  weight  to  the  Respondent's  side  of  the
    scales.   In the Appellant's favour was the fact that this is a genuine
    and happy family unit. The only other factor identified as  potentially
    lending weight to the Appellant's case  was  the  fact  that  when  the
    original visa was issued the ECO granted the Appellant  just  over  two
    years of leave to remain instead of the usual 63 months. There  was  no
    explanation as to why the grant was made as it was, but the  First-tier
    Tribunal noted that there was no obligation, in law or policy, for  the
    maximum available period of leave to be given. In any event it  was  an
    ongoing requirement that the maintenance and accommodation requirements
    were met, and in this case they were not.


 8. The Tribunal considered all of those factors and having done  so  found
    the decision to be wholly proportionate.  The appeal was dismissed.




    The Appeal


 9. The Appellant now  has  permission  to  appeal  on  the  basis  of  the
    following grounds:


           a) The  determination  fails  to  adequately  address  the  best
              interests of the children in this family. Although  reference
              is made to that question, it goes unanswered;

           b) The determination fails to address material evidence  adduced
              by  the  Appellant  regarding  the   deteriorating   security
              situation  in  Iraq  generally   and   in   Sulamaniyyah   in
              particular;


           c) There is an error of fact in  that  the  Tribunal  found  the
              Sponsor to have "chosen" to give up his job. In  fact,  there
              was evidence before the Tribunal  that  the  Sponsor  was  in
              receipt of Employment Support Allowance (ESA) which  is  only
              available to jobseekers who  are  suffering  from  incapacity
              preventing their ability to work.




10. The  Respondent  opposes  the  appeal  on  all  grounds.  Ms  Johnstone
    submitted that there was little more the Tribunal could say  about  the
    best interests of the two children because all it knew  was  that  they
    were very young and that they  lived  with  their  parents.    Although
    evidence had been produced about the ISIS-induced refugee flow into the
    Sulaymaniyyah area and the  poor  humanitarian  conditions  there,  the
    Appellant still has family in  the  city  and  it  was  therefore  very
    unlikely that she and her children would end up in  an  IDP  camp.  The
    evidence was not therefore material.   The Appellant was  a  full  time
    English teacher before she left Iraq and there was no  reason  why  she
    could not resume that work. The security situation in Sulamaniyyah  had
    not reached the Article 15(c) threshold.  In respect  of  BA's  claimed
    inability to work the Tribunal  had  been  provided  with  a  statement
    wherein he said that he wanted to return to work as soon  as  possible.
    It had not been explained  why  the  Appellant  herself  had  not  been
    working to support the family in the UK. There was no evidence  at  all
    that there would be any technical obstacles to  BA  travelling  to  the
    Kurdish area of Iraq: he had done it before and there is an airport  at
    Sulaymaniyyah that he could fly straight into.




    Error of Law


11. I deal with grounds a) and b) together.  It does  not  appear  to  have
    been contemplated that the Appellant should return to Iraq without  her
    children. At the date of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    children were aged just 23 and 3 months respectively.  It  was  not  in
    issue that she was their primary carer.  Although  there  was  evidence
    before it to the effect that the family would keep the children here[4]
    , the Tribunal appears to have progressed on the assumption  that  they
    would stay with their mother.  In assessing their position upon  return
    to Iraq the determination has regard to the following factors:


               . The children have no health issues;
               . They are at a young age and could easily adapt to  life  in
                 Iraq
               . The Appellant has family members still in Sulamaniyyah
               . The city is under control of the "Kurdish Group"


12. In taking those matters into account the determination notes: "where an
    applicant ceases to meet the requirements of the rules  but  has  young
    children in the UK, provided the children can live in  the  country  of
    origin, their presence in the UK cannot be a complete answer or bar  to
    the removal of  the  parent".  Mr  Markus  accepted  that  this  was  a
    sustainable legal direction.  His complaint was that this was  not  the
    only matter that the Tribunal  had  to  take  into  account.  What  was
    required by s55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009
    was a holistic assessment of the circumstances of the children both  in
    the UK and in the country of proposed return.  In respect of the latter
    he  submitted  that  the  analysis  of  First-tier  Tribunal  had  been
    incomplete. He pointed  to  the  evidence  that  had  been  before  the
    Tribunal regarding the situation in Sulamaniyyah  which  has  not  been
    addressed in the determination.  The Appellant herself  had  given  the
    following unchallenged evidence:


         "My family are living in  Sulamaniyah  in  Northern  Iraq  and  the
         situation there is extremely insecure. Two  weeks  ago,  a  suicide
         bomb was detonated in the town of Sulamaniyah and  ordinary  people
         were  killed.  Things  got  so  bad  recently  when  NATO   started
         airstrikes, my  family  were  terrified  and  they  made  plans  to
         leave...In the end they did not leave the city but they  are  still
         very, very frightened of ISIL and the  terrorist  attacks  and  the
         conflict that is happening in areas nearby...


         In addition to this, for more than three  months  there  have  been
         economic problems in the Kurdish region. There are lots  of  people
         moving into the city from elsewhere, people fleeing  violence....My
         family does not have enough money to support  us...My  father  lost
         his eyesight in both eyes during the war in Iraq and he  is  unable
         to work. My brothers are all married and have moved away  and  have
         their own families and they could not support us. I have  only  one
         brother living at home, who looks after my father and mother who is
         also ill".

13. In support of her own evidence the Appellant had produced a  bundle  of
    country background material.  In June 2014  the  UNHCR  reported  Iraqi
    government statistics that 434,000 civilians had fled their homes since
    the conflict with ISIL escalated; UNHCR's own estimate was  that  there
    were 480,000 displaced Iraqis. Sulamaniyyah is identified as having one
    of the highest concentrations of  IDPs.  By  the  18th  July  2014  the
    estimated numbers had increased to 650,000. The humanitarian  challenge
    of providing for those numbers was exacerbated by the presence of  some
    225,000 Syrians who had fled across  the  border  into  Kurdish  areas.
    Where possible IDPs were staying with relatives, but  those  who  could
    not do so were being accommodated  in  emergency  shelter  in  schools,
    tents and government buildings.  The  bundle  contained  travel  advice
    issued by the FCO  in  September  2014  that  "the  security  situation
    throughout Iraq remains uncertain and could deteriorate  quickly".   At
    that  time  the  FCO  advised  against  all  but  essential  travel  to
    Sulaymaniyyah.


14. I accept the Appellant's point, as I think did Ms Johnstone, that  none
    of this evidence is  expressly  addressed  in  the  determination.  The
    submission made on behalf of the Respondent was that  any  omission  in
    this regard was not relevant, since the Appellant would not be  an  IDP
    forced to live in a school or camp. She would  be  living  with  family
    members.  Ms  Johnstone  pointed  out  that  Sulaymaniyyah  is  not   a
    "contested area" and that the security situation has  not  yet  reached
    the Article 15 (c) threshold.  I  have  taken  those  submissions  into
    account, but I  am  satisfied  that  the  omission  was  material.  The
    Appellant was not claiming that she was entitled to refugee  status  or
    humanitarian protection. She did not need  to  establish  that  Article
    15(c) was engaged.  Her case was simply that the security situation had
    substantially changed since she left Sulaymaniyyah,  and  indeed  since
    her husband last visited. The rise of IS in Iraq and Syria  meant  that
    there had been an influx of tens of thousands of IDPs to the  province.
    This had created not just a very difficult socio-economic  environment,
    but increased instability  and  violence,  including  within  the  city
    itself. This was why her family had wanted to leave  and  why,  in  her
    words, they were "very, very frightened".  She pointed to this evidence
    to explain why she did not believe it to be reasonable that she returns
    there at present, with or without two very young children  in  tow.   I
    accept the Appellant's submission that the security and  socio-economic
    challenges faced by her family in Sulaymaniyyah were plainly  pertinent
    to the "best interests" assessment required by s55, as well as  to  any
    rounded assessment of proportionality.


15. Ground c) concerns the ability or otherwise of the Sponsor to work. The
    grounds suggest that the determination does not contain clear  findings
    on whether BA gave up work through choice or illness. It appears to  me
    to be tolerably clear [see for instance paragraphs 55 and 56] that  the
    Tribunal found him to have made a choice to leave his paid  employment,
    and that it found his  claims  as  to  illness  unproven  for  lack  of
    evidence. It is clear that this  was  a  matter  that  weighed  heavily
    against the Appellant in the  proportionality  balancing  exercise.  At
    pages 29 to 32 of  the  Appellant's  bundle  are  documents  issued  by
    JobCentrePlus showing BA to be in receipt  of  Employment  and  Support
    Allowance (ESA) from February 2014.  I accept the submission made by Mr
    Markus that these documents establish  that  as  far  as  the  DWP  was
    concerned, BA was unfit for work.  The document itself explains that in
    order to continue receiving it BA  may  be  required  to  submit  to  a
    medical examination, and the  benefit  is  defined  on  the  government
    website as "a benefit for people who are unable to work due to  illness
    or disability"[5].

16. The grounds are therefore made out. I find that  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal does contains errors of law such that  it  must  be
    set aside.



    The Re-Made Decision

17. The legal framework that I apply  in  re-making  this  decision  is  as
    follows:


              i) Because the  Appellant  was  given  leave  to  enter  under
                 paragraph 281  of  the  'old  Rules'  her  application  for
                 further leave to remain falls to be decided with  reference
                 to paragraph 284;


             ii) It is for the Appellant to demonstrate that she  meets  the
                 requirements of paragraph 284 and  she  must  do  so  on  a
                 balance of probabilities;


            iii) Insofar as paragraph  284  requires  the  Appellant  to  be
                 "maintained adequately" this is to be gauged with reference
                 to the  applicable  Income  Support  rate:  KA  and  Others
                 (Adequacy of Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065;

             iv) If the Appellant does not discharge the burden of proof  in
                 respect of the Rules I must have regard to Article  8  ECHR
                 and do so by applying the Razgar framework;

              v) In any assessment of proportionality I must have regard  to
                 the  best  interests  of  the   Appellant's   children   in
                 accordance  with  s55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship   and
                 Immigration Act 2009;

             vi) As this is an in-country appeal I must  determine  it  with
                 reference to the position  and  evidence  at  the  date  of
                 appeal. To that end I gave permission to the  Appellant  to
                 adduce further evidence at the hearing



    The Rules


18. Paragraph 284 of the Immigration Rules reads:

      2.
                 (i) the applicant is aged 65 or over at the time he makes

        1. (ix)(c) the applicant has obtained an academic qualification
           (not a professional or vocational qualification), which is
           deemed by UK NARIC to meet the recognised standard of a

           educational establishment in one of the following countries:
           Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; The Bahamas; Barbados; Belize;
           Dominica; Grenada; Guyana; Ireland; Jamaica; New Zealand; St
           Kitts and Nevis; St Lucia; St Vincent and The Grenadines;
           Trinidad and Tobago; the UK; the USA; and provides the specified
           documents; or
       .
        1. (ix)(d) the applicant has obtained an academic qualification
           (not a professional or vocational qualification) which is deemed

           Master's degree or PhD in the UK, and provides the specified
           evidence to show:
      2.          (1) he has the qualification, and
            (2) that the qualification was taught or researched in English.

19. At the date of the application BA was not "settled" since he  only  had
    limited leave to remain as a refugee. It is not now in issue that he is
    settled today, because on the 8th June 2015 he was  granted  indefinite
    leave to remain and on the 8th January 2016 naturalised  as  a  British
    citizen.


20. I find as fact that the Appellant was last given  leave  in  accordance
    with Part 8 of the Immigration Rules for a  period  of  more  than  six
    months. I am satisfied that she is married to BA, that  they  have  met
    and that they intend to live together as man and  wife.   There  is  no
    issue as to her having overstayed.  The marriage  did  not  take  place
    after the making of a deportation order. I am therefore satisfied  that
    at  the  date  of  the  re-making,  the  Appellant  meets  all  of  the
    requirements of paragraph 284(i)-(vi).

21. In respect of accommodation the family are living in a rented  property
    in South Manchester. A joint tenancy agreement has been provided.   The
    Secretary of State has not taken any issue with the  adequacy  of  this
    property. A letter dated 5th March 2016 from  Manchester  City  Council
    demonstrates that the rent is largely  paid  for  by  housing  benefit.
    Since the primary recipient of  that  benefit  is  BA,  to  pay  for  a
    property where he can live with his British children,  I  am  satisfied
    that there is no additional recourse to public funds in  the  Appellant
    living there with them. Paragraph 284 (vii) is satisfied.

22. The current position on maintenance is that BA is working as a  barber.
    He is employed by Milano Barber Shop in Stockport.  The  proprietor  Mr
    Dyari Hamakarem has written to confirm that he earns �7.20 per hour and
    works 16 hours per week. That amounts to �115.20 gross per week.   This
    income is supplemented by benefits.  His Barclays Bank statements  show
    him to be in receipt of  approximately  �117  per  week  in  Child  Tax
    Credit. His TSB statements show receipt of a further �34.40 per week in
    child benefit. The total current family income is therefore �266.60 per
    week.  The Appellant's  bundle  contains  a  schedule  showing  that  a
    British family of the same size would receive �263.81 per  week  if  in
    receipt  of  income  support.  I  am  satisfied  on  the   balance   of
    probabilities that the Appellant meets the  KA  threshold.  The  family
    income exceeds the income support level and her presence results in  no
    additional recourse to public funds.   The  requirements  of  paragraph
    284(viii) are met.

23. The Secretary of State has not taken any issue with the ability of  the
    Appellant to speak English to the requisite  level.  For  the  sake  of
    completeness  I  am  satisfied  that  she  meets  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 284 (ix), having had regard to the  Edexcel  certificates  in
    the bundle.

24. I find on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant meets all  of
    the requirements of paragraph  284  and  her  appeal  is  allowed  with
    reference to the Immigration Rules.



    Article 8

25. The appeal is allowed under the Rules and there is therefore no need to
    address Article 8. I do so only on the  alternative  basis  that  I  am
    wrong in my conclusions on paragraph 284.


26. It is not in issue that this is a genuine and subsisting  relationship,
    or that Article 8 is engaged. I am satisfied that  there  would  be  an
    interference with family life in the case of  the  Appellant's  removal
    since I accept that there is, to adopt the phrase used  by  BA  in  his
    witness statement, "no way" that the family would risk  the  safety  or
    health of the children by sending them to Iraq with their mother.  That
    is a perfectly rational conclusion for the Appellant  and  BA  to  have
    reached. The situation in Iraq is very different today than it  was  in
    2010 when he last visited Sulamaniyya and she left.


27. The question is then whether it would be proportionate  to  remove  the
    Appellant in those circumstances. Ms Johnstone  pointed  out  that  the
    separation would not be forever, and that the  Appellant  could  always
    make an application to come back to the UK and join her husband here. I
    have been given no evidence on how long such a separation would  likely
    be. I do not believe I need to have that estimate. However long it is -
    even if it is only a matter of  months  -  it  is  likely  to  have  an
    unjustifiably harsh impact on  the  Appellant  and  her  (now  British)
    children. They are very young children who  are  dependent  upon  their
    mother for everyday care, love and support. Their father would no doubt
    do his best but I am satisfied that at such a young age it would be  in
    their best interests to remain with their mother.

28. I am mindful of the fact  that  BA  is  a  refugee  who  has  found  it
    difficult to work because of various health issues and that at the date
    of decision this prevented him from being able to provide for his  wife
    to the standard required by  the  Rules.   I  bear  in  mind  that  the
    Appellant herself has always complied with the Immigration  Rules,  and
    she speaks a good level of English.

29. I find as fact that it would not be reasonable to expect  the  children
    to travel to Sulamaniyya with their mother. They are  British  children
    and entitled to remain here to enjoy the benefits of their citizenship,
    including safety and healthcare. It would be wholly contrary  to  their
    best interests and, I find, unreasonable to expect them to leave the UK
    and travel to Iraq, a country where the foreign  office  warns  against
    all but essential travel.  I need not embark on a forensic analysis  of
    whether the situation in Sulamaniyya  reaches  the  level  required  to
    engage Article 15(c) to make  that  finding.  Section  117B(6)  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provides that it  will  not
    be in the public interest to remove a person where that person enjoys a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with  a  qualifying  child  and  it
    would not be reasonable for that child to leave the  UK.  The  test  of
    "reasonable" is not the high test imposed by either  Article  15(c)  or
    even proportionality outside of the Rules.

30. If I am wrong in allowing the appeal under the Rules,  I  allow  it  on
    human rights grounds.

       .




      Decisions

31. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    it is set aside.


32. I re-make the decision in the appeal as follows:

    "The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.


    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds".


33. Although the Appellant herself does not merit a direction for anonymity
    this case does turn on the involvement of  two  British  children.  For
    that reason I make the following Order:


         "Pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the
         Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise,  no  report  of  these
         proceedings or any form of publication thereof  shall  directly  or
         indirectly identify the Respondent  (original  appellant)  in  this
         determination identified as KAA. This direction applies to, amongst
         others, all parties. Any failure  to  comply  with  this  direction
         could give rise to contempt of court proceedings."
