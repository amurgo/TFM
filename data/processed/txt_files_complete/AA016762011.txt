                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


INTRODUCTION

 1. The appellant, who is a national of Zimbabwe where she was  born  on  5
    January 1981, is one of seven appellants whose appeals were remitted by
    the Court of Appeal in its decision SS & Ors (Zimbabwe) v. SSHD  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 237.  One of those appellants (SC) has been granted  leave  to
    remain by the  Secretary  of  State.   We  heard  the  appeals  by  the
    remaining appellants on dates between 14 and 21 October as directed  by
    the Court of Appeal. Ms Isherwood represented  the  respondent  and  Mr
    Howard the appellants in each case.  We heard generic submissions  from
    the representatives on the current situation in Zimbabwe in  the  light
    of the further country guidance decision by the Upper  Tribunal  in  CM
    (EM country guidance, disclosure) Zimbabwe CG [2013] UKUT  00059  (IAC)
    approving the earlier country guidance decision in EM (Zimbabwe) &  Ors
    v SSHD [2011] UKUT 98 (IAC) and specific submissions in  each  case  at
    the conclusion of all the evidence.

 2. As it appeared to be convenient, we have made  separate  determinations
    for each appellant. Our analysis of the case law is of  application  to
    all six appeals and it is therefore  reproduced  without  amendment  in
    each determination.

 3. But for BC, the appellants in the other appeals are found  to  have  no
    significant MDC profile and accordingly it is only for  this  appellant
    that we need to have regard to additional case analysis on risk at  the
    point of entry.

 4. Specific to  the  appellant  BC,  the  Court  of  Appeal  made  certain
    observations and set out the following  basis  for  the  appeal  to  be
    reheard by the Upper Tribunal:
          1. This is the one case where the Secretary of State at no  stage
             proposed remittal but, instead, throughout had said  that  the
             appeal should be dismissed: on the  basis  that  on  any  view
             there had been no error of law in the tribunal decision.
          1. BC was born on 5 January 1981 and lived in Mandara  (a  suburb
             of Harare) until 2000. She came to the United  Kingdom  on  13
             June 2000 on a visitor visa. Thereafter leave  to  remain  was
             extended to enable her to complete her studies for  a  degree.
             Her husband visited on a number of occasions. BC had  a  child
             on 4 January 2010. The  husband  made  an  asylum  application
             (with BC as his dependant) in April 2009. That  was  rejected,
             the rejection being upheld on appeal. BC then herself made  an
             asylum claim on 16 November 2010, which the Secretary of State
             rejected.
          1.  By  determination  dated  14  March  2011  Immigration  Judge
             Robertson, sitting in the First-tier Tribunal,  rejected  BC's
             appeal. It had transpired that in 2010  BC  and  her  husband,
             while in the United Kingdom, had joined the  MDC  and  BC  was
             elected as a branch secretary and treasurer.  The  Immigration
             Judge found that this was designed to boost the asylum  claim.
             The Immigration Judge found, moreover, that  the  various  sur
             place activities and positions held would  not  result  in  BC
             coming to the attention of the authorities  in  Zimbabwe.  The
             Immigration Judge further found that, even if they did come to
             their attention, there was no real likelihood of risk  because
             of her sur place activities. This was because BC's husband had
             past connections with  the  government  and  his  parents  had
             connections with the civil service (at the  husband's  appeal,
             indeed, the parents had been found to be  ZANU-PF  loyalists):
             and so  the  authorities  would  be  "likely...to  regard  her
             activities as insincere". In reaching her overall  conclusion,
             the Immigration Judge  had  regard  to  the  Court  of  Appeal
             decision in RT ( Zimbabwe) and the  country  guidance  in  RN
             ( Zimbabwe). Article 8 claims were also rejected.
          1. Permission to appeal was granted,  essentially  on  the  basis
             that the Immigration Judge was arguably wrong to  have  placed
             extensive reliance on the findings of the tribunal  judge  who
             had previously determined the husband's appeal. In  the  Upper
             Tribunal, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Juss,  by  promulgation
             dated 1 October 2011, dismissed  the  appeal.  He  found  that
             there was no material error of law. The Immigration Judge  had
             been entitled to place reliance on the  earlier  determination
             in assessing the husband's evidence: and had made  independent
             findings of her own with regard to BC specifically. The Deputy
             Upper Tribunal Judge noted, and clearly accepted, the  finding
             that even if the sur place activities did  become  known  they
             would be likely to be accepted as insincere.
          1. Permission to appeal was refused by the Upper Tribunal.  Moses
             LJ refused an application for  permission  to  appeal  on  the
             papers. Permission  was  eventually  granted,  after  an  oral
             hearing, by Sullivan LJ on 21 November 2012 in  the  aftermath
             of the Supreme Court decision in RT ( Zimbabwe). In addition,
             BC has indicated that she also wished to argue that  the  best
             interests of the child required proper assessment.
          1. Given  the  findings  of  fact  in  the  tribunal  I  have  no
             difficulty at all in rejecting Mr Mahmood's argument that  the
             appeal  should  be   allowed   outright.   The   position   is
             demonstrably different from that in the KM appeal  as  decided
             in RT (Zimbabwe), on which (yet again) he relied.
          1. Altogether closer to the line in this case  was  Mr  Thomann's
             submission that the appeal should  be  dismissed.  His  point,
             even by reference to RT (Zimbabwe ) and  RN  (Zimbabwe),  was
             that BC, even if her sur place activities  became  known  (and
             the finding was that they would not), would  be  at  no  risk:
             because her profile - through her husband  and  his  family  -
             would be of perceived and assumed loyalty, as the  Immigration
             Judge  found.  Moreover,  the  milieu  from  which  she   came
             supported that. Thus she would not be  at  any  real  risk  of
             being stopped and interrogated. This was  even  more  strongly
             so,  he  subsequently  has  submitted,  in  the  light  of  CM
             (Zimbabwe).
          1. I see the force in this. But, on balance, I  think  this  case
             too should be remitted. It is true that the Immigration  Judge
             found that the sur place activities would  not  become  known.
             But the Immigration Judge did not, apparently, regard that  as
             conclusive  and  went  on  to  say  that  in  any  event   the
             authorities would be  "likely"  to  find  such  activities  as
             "insincere" (a finding endorsed by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
             Juss). How such a finding as to what is likely can be made  in
             such a situation is unclear to me. Indeed the  approach  -  at
             all events arguably - comes close, by  analogy,  to  following
             the line of speculative reasoning specifically disapproved  by
             Lord Kerr  in  paragraph  72  of  RT  (Zimbabwe).  While  this
             objection was not formally taken in the grounds of appeal,  it
             was noted by Senior  Immigration  Judge  Jarvis  (in  refusing
             permission to appeal in  the  Court  of  Appeal)  as  arguably
             "something of a leap" in the absence of supporting evidence. I
             note also that the Immigration Judge did not (because  of  the
             view she took) make a finding as to whether BC  was  indeed  a
             ZANU-PF supporter in reality and so did not  consider  whether
             she would be required to  lie  or  be  unable  to  demonstrate
             loyalty if stopped.
          1. Overall, therefore, I think justice requires that the case  be
             remitted for determination. It will also be a matter  for  the
             Upper Tribunal as to how it deals with the proposed new ground
             based on the best interests of the child.

 5. We heard evidence from BC who explained that she  had  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom in 2001.  The  reference  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  to
    arrival the year earlier stems from an error by the Secretary of  State
    in the refusal letter dated  13  January  2011  which  accompanied  the
    removal decision of 27 January 2011.  In the light of the detail in the
    extract from the Court of Appeal 's  decision,  it  is  unnecessary  to
    repeat the chronology except to make the additional points that:

      i) The appellant had leave to remain as a student at or completion  of
         her degree in social care and policy  at  Wolverhampton  University
         until 30 November 2009.

     ii) She thereafter made application for further leave to  remain  under
         the Tier 4 points-based system to pursue a postgraduate degree. The
         first application was rejected, initially because  a  part  of  the
         from had not been completed and by the time the appellant  came  to
         resubmit on 16 February, the Immigration  Rules  had  changed  such
         that she could not comply with them without returning  to  Zimbabwe
         to reapply.

    iii) Application for asylum was made on 16 November 2010.

     iv) The appellant married CC a national of Zimbabwe in August 2008 in a
         traditional ceremony.  He had been away from Zimbabwe in Cuba until
         2006 when he came to continue his studies in  the  United  Kingdom.
         They have a child born  4  January  2010.   The  appellant  is  now
         pregnant and is expecting to give birth some two  weeks  hence   by
         way of caesarean section.

      v)  CC applied for asylum on 24 April 2009 with the appellant  as  his
         dependent which was refused. His appeal was dismissed by the First-
         tier Tribunal after a hearing on 25 June  2010.   He  has  judicial
         review proceedings under way  after  being  refused  permission  to
         appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 6. Having regard to the basis on which the appeal had been remitted and in
    the light of a statement which had been provided,  Mr  Howard  accepted
    that no examination-in-chief  was  required  before  cross-examination.
    The evidence we heard covered the appellant's political  activities  in
    the United Kingdom, her domestic circumstances and those of  her  child
    and her pregnancy.

THE REFUSAL LETTER

 7. The reasons why the Secretary of State rejected the  appellant's  claim
    are set out in the refusal  letter  we  have  referred  to  above.   In
    summarising the appellant's claim the respondent observed that she  had
    never experienced any problems in Zimbabwe.  On leaving high school  in
    1999 she had worked for a company as an accounts officer.   Her  father
    left for South Africa in 1999 having  separated  from  her  mother  the
    previous year.  Her mother moved to South Africa in 2004/2005 where she
    lived (at the time of  the  interview)  with  two  of  the  appellant's
    brothers. Her sister is studying in  Tanzania  and  another  sister  at
    university in South Africa where she lives with her father.

 8. As to her political activity in the United Kingdom, the  appellant  had
    explained to the Secretary of  State  that  since  2005  she  had  been
    interested in the MDC and joined the Coventry branch of this  party  in
    April  2010  since  when  she  has  attended  meetings.   It  is   this
    association with MDC which is the basis of her fear of being killed  by
    the ZANU-PF.

 9. It appears the basis of CC's claim had been that he was a  teacher  and
    his appeal had been dismissed on the basis that he had  never  formally
    qualified or worked as such.

10. The respondent noted  the  appellant's  claim  that  she  had  attended
    meetings at the end of each month and had  been  able  to  provide  the
    names and roles of the Coventry branch  executive  but  was  unable  to
    demonstrate even a basic knowledge of the MDC  as  a  political  party.
    She had stated that funds raised by her branch were sent to Tendai Biti
    in Harare but was unable to state what role he had  within  the  party.
    She was unable to name neither the  current  party  spokesman  nor  the
    national chairperson and was unaware who from the MDC  represented  her
    home area of Mandara (a suburb of Harare) in Zimbabwe.

11. Although accepting the appellant may have obtained  a  membership  card
    for the MDC, it was  not  accepted  that  she  was  a  genuine,  active
    supporter. This was because she had waited five years before attempting
    to join the organisation had had failed to provide a persuasive account
    of her reasons for doing so. She had stated  in  her  asylum  interview
    that she had attended eight or none meetings but this was not reflected
    in the minutes which she had provided.

12. The respondent also drew an  adverse  inference  from  the  appellant's
    explanation she had not joined the MDC earlier as  she  was  not  aware
    where the meetings were  held or the  branches  were.   The  respondent
    considered the appellant more than capable  of  researching  the  party
    structure in the UK.  Reliance was also  placed  by  the  Secretary  of
    State on aspects of CC's claim and  the  judge's  finding.  By  way  of
    conclusion the respondent stated:

         "It is considered that your membership of  the  MDC  is  a  cynical
         attempt to bolster your asylum claim, and it is not  accepted  that
         your account with regards to your interest in  or  role  with,  the
         MDC, is credible."

13. As to the human rights aspect of the claim,  the  respondent  explained
    that consideration had been  given to the appellant's family life  with
    CC and their son and in addition the appellant's private life which  it
    was accepted had been  established through the pursuit of her  studies.
    As to the son, the respondent considered that the  appellant  would  be
    able to pursue her studies and future employment in Zimbabwe where  she
    had resided for the majority of her life and that her son would be able
    to attend school.  He was not  of  an  age  where  he  had  spent   his
    "formulative" years in the UK.

14. The respondent  acknowledged  s.55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act  2009  and  considered  that  as  a  dependent  on  the
    appellant's claim her son would be returning to Zimbabwe with  her  and
    his father which was considered to be in his best  interests.   He  was
    considered to be of an age where he would be able  to  fully  integrate
    into Zimbabwe as he had spent a limited amount of time in the UK  at  a
    significantly young age. No welfare issues had been  identified.

THE HEARING BEFORE THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

15. First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson heard evidence from  the  appellant
    at the hearing of her appeal on 11 March 2011.  The oral  evidence  the
    judge heard included:

      i) The appellant was a branch secretary of a Coventry  branch  of  the
         MDC to which  she  had  been  elected  in  February  2011  and  the
         treasurer of the Woman's Assembly at district level for  which  she
         was elected on 3 March 2011. The appellant  was  involved  in  fund
         raising and that would not go unnoticed.

     ii) The appellant had joined the MDC "officially"  in  April  2010;  in
         March that year she had gone to  some  meetings  but  did  not  pay
         subscription until April which she began to pay that month.

    iii) As to why she had waited five years  before  joining,  due  to  her
         upbringing as a Christian, there had  been  hardly  any  experience
         with politics by the family and she had  (had)  no  real  political
         opinion.

     iv) Getting to the MDC branch was not easy. It was put to her in cross-
         examination that she had explained she had  not  attended  meetings
         since she did not know where they were held and did  not  have  the
         funds.

      v) As to her inability to answer questions regarding the names of  the
         branch executive of the MDC, there  had  been  a  misunderstanding.
         She was able to give the names and there was  one  name  which  she
         could not recall but she recalled it later on in the interview. She
         had not previously submitted minutes (of the  meetings)  before  as
         this was no longer permitted to do so and they were only allowed to
         submit photographs.

     vi) As to her statement that the CIO infiltrated  meetings,  she  could
         not say whether any checks had been carried  out  on  her  and  her
         husband.

    vii) Her nomination as the treasurer of the Woman's  Assembly  had  been
         because of her past skills in Zimbabwe where she had once worked in
         accounts and was good with figures.

16. Among the matters accepted by the judge were the following:

      i) The appellant had attended MDC meetings, she was a member and  that
         she had been so elected.

     ii) It was implausible that those who had made her aware of politics in
         the UK activities of the MDC did not go so far as to tell  her  how
         to get to meetings.

    iii) CC had been the Assembly for Youth  chairperson  and  a  particular
         internet printout had been provided updated on 10 January 2011. The
         printout, updated 23 February 2011, showed that he  was  no  longer
         the Assembly for Youth chairperson. The judge was concerned that he
         had not occupied the role for a particularly lengthy time and  this
         did nothing to inspire confidence that his involvement was genuine.



     iv) Despite some  misgivings  about  the  timing  and  quality  of  the
         appellant's interest in the MDC it was accepted that she had raised
         her   profile   and   her   name    appears    on    the    website
         www.mdcukandireland.org.uk.  Whilst the appellant's  name  appeared
         on the website as the branch secretary of the  Coventry  branch  of
         "MDC UK", there did not appear to be any way of placing a name to a
         face with reference to the poor quality photographic evidence.

17. The judge's ultimate conclusion was that despite having been  named  as
    branch secretary and the treasurer, this would not result in her coming
    to the attention of the authorities on the basis that nothing would  be
    known about her through activities in Zimbabwe.

18. In her most recent statement dated 17 July 2013, the appellant explains
    the following matters:

      i) She is still actively involved with the MDC and was promoted to the
         role of Provincial Youth Assembly Secretary since  October/November
         2012, a relatively high position within the MDC in the UK.

     ii) She attends meetings of the MDC monthly the  last  having  been  in
         Northampton. In addition  she  chats  to  other  members  by  video
         conferencing.

    iii) The appellant is involved in coordinating the  MDC  in  the  United
         Kingdom with Harare. She  speaks  Shona  and  is  from  Mandara,  a
         "relatively high density" area.

     iv) The appellant refers to her pregnancy and explains that it  is  not
         in the best interests of her child for her to be  returned  to  any
         part of Zimbabwe where her life is in danger.  She refers to family
         life with her paternal aunt and uncle who having sought asylum have
         now become British citizens and she sees them around once every two
         months.  Her husband's parents are also British citizens  and  live
         in Nuneaton and they see each other most weeks and at the weekends.
         She teaches kindergarten Bible studies at the Seven  Day  Adventist
         Church in Walsall. She is involved with  Citizens  UK  and  attends
         meetings every three months. This  is  a  community  group  helping
         people integrate into the community.

THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BEFORE US

19. The following key matters emerged in the course of cross-examination by
    Ms Isherwood:

      i) The appellant has no family  in  Zimbabwe  and  she  confirmed  the
         whereabouts of her other family members as stated to the First-tier
         Tribunal.  She had no surviving uncles or aunts still  in  Zimbabwe
         nor did her husband have any family there.  She  was  unaware  when
         his parents had last been  here.

     ii) As to whom she is  in  contact  with  in  Zimbabwe,  the  appellant
         referred to Skype call conferences with Solomon Madzore who is  the
         leader of the Youth Assembly in Zimbabwe.  She did not  think  they
         (with reference to her MDC contacts) were in hiding.  They are  the
         "big shots". She referred to the trouble that Solomon  Madzore  had
         encountered and to the risks faced by people in  the  lower  ranks.
         Solomon Madzore having been imprisoned for about a year and a  half
         and that she is almost the same level as he is.

    iii) With reference to the MDC structure in UK, provincial level is  the
         highest and she is the deputy secretary of Provincial Youth.  After
         a detailed exchange including questions from us we established that
         the Provincial Committee for  Youth  comprises  a  chair  and  vice
         chair, a treasurer  and  vice  treasurer  (the  latter  post  being
         vacant), a secretary for information  and  publicity  (who  attends
         infrequently),  a  secretary  and  vice   secretary   (roles   held
         respectively by CC and the appellant) and an  organising  secretary
         and vice secretary.

     iv) As to whether there was anybody above her in the MDC, the appellant
         referred to the main Provincial Committee and described  the  Youth
         Committee as a subcommittee alongside the Woman's Committee, so the
         most senior person of all is the chair of the Provincial  Committee
         and, in aggregate, the committees  comprise  some  25  people.  The
         appellant confirmed that she is  not  on  the  committee  which  is
         regarded as the highest in the  United  Kingdom  for  the  MDC  but
         reminded Ms Isherwood that the committee which she is on is one  at
         provincial level.

      v) The appellant confirmed  that  the  people  with  whom  she  is  in
         communication in Zimbabwe are  on  about  the  same  level  as  the
         chairman (of the Youth Committee) and referred again  to  the  fate
         suffered by Solomon Madzore who had been put  in  prison  on  false
         allegations and that he had been  cleared  on  his  release  a  few
         months ago.

     vi) With reference to Solomon Madzore, the appellant understood that he
         had been through court procedures in Zimbabwe and that she  thought
         that he had been cleared.  She liked to think that he  had  got  on
         with his life although it had been a  while since she had spoken to
         him. As to when  there  had  last  been  Skype  communication,  the
         appellant explained that she  would  need  to  "come  back"  to  Ms
         Isherwood on that.  As to how often she speaks to people in the MDC
         and Zimbabwe, the appellant stated that she did not talk  to  them,
         explaining that it was their chair who spoke mostly. He attends the
         Provincial Committee meeting.

    vii) The criterion for membership of the Youth Assembly  is  35.   There
         are some 500 in the UK, fewer than the adult members. The appellant
         believed they all had MDC cards.

   viii) The appellant further clarified that there were about eight or nine
         districts of the MDC in the United Kingdom and that each has  about
         50 or 60 Youth members.

     ix) As to why the authorities would be interested in her, the appellant
         explained that besides mundane matters they organised fund raising.
          The committee does not meet as much any more, a chat room is used.
         The last important meeting was in December  2012.   The  appellant,
         however, saw members of the committee living in the  West  Midlands
         more often and the last meeting had been in June to set up  a  bank
         account for which ID was required.  That fund raising was  for  MDC
         members displaced in Zimbabwe and for education.

      x) The appellant also confirmed that she holds a position as treasurer
         at a local district level and the  person  she  spoke  to  in  that
         regard  is  the  chair  of  the  District   Committee,   the   last
         conversation having been some three months ago.  The level of funds
         under her charge is some �300.  As to the Youth Committee, as  soon
         as funds are raised they are sent and there is currently about  �50
         left.  The amount sent this year was about �300.  She referred to a
         function when fundraising in December last year or  November  being
         unable to remember the precise date.  She  referred  to  a  meeting
         booked for January which had been cancelled.

     xi) Otherwise the appellant  explained  that  she  was  a  kindergarten
         teacher at church.  Her husband's family is from Hatfield and  that
         she had been asked once over to their  house.  She was  unaware  if
         they were still there.  CC does not talk about any contact.

    xii) Her immigration difficulties arising out of her unsuccessful Tier 4
         Student application occurred when  she  was  distracted  by  having
         given birth by  Caesarean  section.   Her  son  had  had  breathing
         difficulties. The result in the change in the Rules  was  that  she
         had to go back to Zimbabwe to make the application and she was  too
         afraid to do so.  Her father had worked as an insurance  broker  in
         Zimbabwe and her mother initially for the  government  in  industry
         and commerce and then for the church.

   xiii) As to her son's health, the appellant explained that he has  asthma
         and eczema for which he needs an inhaler.  She rated his asthma  at
         a high level and that they had  been   to  accident  and  emergency
         quite a few times.

20.  Under re-examination the appellant clarified that the fund raising had
    been to help people under the MDC who had  been  affected  politically,
    such as having their houses burned down,  or  having  no  clothes.  She
    confirmed that the campaign was humanitarian in nature.

21. We indicated at the end of the appellant's evidence our view  that  the
    issue we  were  required  to  determine  was  whether  the  appellant's
    position  in  the  provincial  section  was  a  high  profile  category
    identified in CM (Zimbabwe). Accordingly we did not need to  hear  from
    the appellant's husband.  We reminded the  parties  that  the  analysis
    would require examination of how the appellant would  be  perceived  by
    ZANU-PF and the government and reminded them of the impermissibility of
    ascribing a rational approach to such  a regime.   It  appeared  to  us
    that the appellant's case was the one which had more strength than  the
    others before us, dependent upon the submissions that we  received  and
    our final conclusion.

22. Before hearing our submissions on the next hearing day we were provided
    with some new evidence by Mr Howard. This  was  in  the  light  of  our
    indication that it would be desirable to carry out searches on  Solomon
    Madzore and the appellant herself. He provided  us  with  a  series  of
    Google maps of Harare , the result of a search against SM (one  of  the
    other appellants) and BC as well as Wikipedia entries for  Mabvuku  and
    Glen Norah.

COUNTRY GUIDANCE

23. In CM (EM country guidance; disclosure) Zimbabwe CG [2013] UKUT  00059,
    the Tribunal reviewed the authorities of  RN  (Returnees)  Zimbabwe  CG
    [2008] UKAIT 00083; RT (Zimbabwe) [2010] EWCA Civ 1285: RS  and  Others
    (Zimbabwe - AIDS) Zimbabwe CG [2010] UKUT  363;  HS  (returning  asylum
    seekers) Zimbabwe CG [2007] UKAIT 00094  and in particular, the Country
    Guidance given by the Tribunal in EM and Others (Returnees) Zimbabwe CG
    [2011] UKUT 98 (IAC).  The assessment in  EM  as  to  the  position  in
    Zimbabwe at the end of January  2011  had  not  been  vitiated  by  the
    Tribunal's reliance on anonymous evidence from certain sources  in  the
    Secretary of State's Fact Finding Mission report of 2010. The  Tribunal
    was entitled to find that there had been  a  durable  change  since  RN
    (Returnees) Zimbabwe CG [2008] UKAIT 00083. The only change to  the  EM
    Country Guidance relating to the position as at the end of January 2011
    arose from  the  judgments  of  member  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  RT
    (Zimbabwe) [2012] UKSC 38.

24. The guidance as re-stated, with the appropriate amendments,  was  that,
    as a general matter, there was significantly less politically motivated
    violence in Zimbabwe, compared with the situation considered by the AIT
    in RN.  In particular, the evidence did not establish that, in general,
    the return of a failed asylum seeker from the United Kingdom, having no
    significant MDC profile, would result in that person facing a real risk
    of having to demonstrate loyalty to the ZANU-PF.

25. The position was, however, likely to be otherwise  in  the  case  of  a
    person without ZANU-PF connections, returning from the  United  Kingdom
    after a significant absence to a rural area  of  Zimbabwe,  other  than
    Matabeleland North or Matabeleland South. Such a person might well find
    it difficult to avoid adverse  attention,  amounting  to  serious  ill-
    treatment, from ZANU-PF figures in a position  of  authority  or  those
    whom they  controlled.   Such  adverse  attention  might  well  involve
    demonstrating loyalty to ZANU-PF, with the prospect of serious harm  in
    the event of failure.

26. In accordance with RT, persons not favourably disposed to ZANU-PF  were
    and remain entitled to international protection, whether  or  not  they
    could and would do whatever might  be  necessary  to  demonstrate  such
    loyalty.  However, the situation was not uniform  across  the  relevant
    rural areas. For example, the evidence might disclose that, in the home
    village, ZANU-PF power structures or other means of coercion were  weak
    or absent.  That said, as a general rule, a returnee  from  the  United
    Kingdom to rural Matabeleland North or Matabeleland  South  was  highly
    unlikely  to  face  significant  difficulty  from   ZANU-PF   elements,
    including the security forces, even if the returnee were a  MDC  member
    or supporter. (So, too, with a returnee  to  Bulawayo,  who  would  not
    generally suffer any such adverse attention even if he  or  she  had  a
    significant MDC profile.) There  might  be  exceptions:  an  individual
    might be able to show that his or her village or area was one that was,
    unusually, under the sway of a ZANU-PF chief or the like.

27. A returnee to Harare would in general face no significant difficulties,
    if going to a low-density or medium-density  area.  Whilst  the  socio-
    economic situation in  high-density  areas  was  more  challenging,  in
    general a person without ZANU-PF connections would not face significant
    problems there (including a 'loyalty test') unless  he  or  she  had  a
    significant MDC profile, which might cause him or her to feature  on  a
    list of those targeted for harassment, or  would  otherwise  engage  in
    political activities likely to attract the adverse attention  of  ZANU-
    PF, or would be reasonably likely to engage in such activities, but for
    a fear of thereby coming to the adverse attention of ZANU-PF.

28. In relation to internal relocation, a person's home for the purposes of
    internal relocation is a matter of fact, not necessarily determined  by
    a person's rural homeland. In most cases, it was unlikely that a person
    with a well-founded fear of persecution in a major urban centre such as
    Harare would have a viable internal relocation alternative to  a  rural
    area in the Eastern provinces. For example, relocation to  Matabeleland
    (including Bulawayo) might be  negated  by  discrimination,  where  the
    returnee is Shona.  However, internal relocation from a rural  area  to
    Harare or Bulawayo was, in general, more realistic but, as the test was
    whether it was reasonable/not unduly harsh,  consideration  had  to  be
    given to the individual's social and economic circumstances.

29. So much was stated to be Country Guidance.  In the  course  of  CM  (EM
    country guidance; disclosure), the Tribunal (as at October  2012)  made
    an assessment - albeit not in an  authoritative  capacity  -  of  other
    evidence about Zimbabwe.   The picture then presented by  the  evidence
    as to  the  general  position  of  politically  motivated  violence  in
    Zimbabwe did not materially differ from the position in EM  and  others
    (Returnees) decided on 14 March 2011. The fresh evidence regarding  the
    position at the point of return did not indicate any increase  in  risk
    since HS (returning   asylum seekers); the evidence as to the treatment
    of those who had been returned to Harare Airport since 2007 meant there
    was no justification for extending the scope  of  those  who  might  be
    adversely regarded by the CIO.

30. For our purposes, this summary of the Country Guidance is sufficient.

OUR CCONCLUSIONS

31. In the course of her submissions specific to BC Ms  Isherwood  accepted
    that if she has a significant profile and that  she  is  from  a  high-
    density suburb she would need protection. It was correct of her  to  do
    so as that is no more than the application  of  the  country  guidance.
    Taking into account all the evidence  before  us  and  the  submissions
    specific to this appellant, we  are  satisfied  that  the  BC  and  her
    husband would be perceived  as  having  significant  profiles.  It  was
    accepted by Miss Isherwood that  BC  and  her  husband  hold  posts  as
    secretary and vice secretary of the Provincial Youth  Assembly  in  the
    United  Kingdom  which  has  involved   liaison  with  youth   assembly
    personnel in Zimbabwe and included  fundraising  activities.  Committee
    membership  of  the  Youth  Assembly,  the  Woman's  Assembly  and  the
    Provincial executive in the United Kingdom is likely to indicate to the
    authorities in Zimbabwe that the person concerned is committed  to  the
    MDC cause and contributes in a meaningful way to the advancement of the
    parties  manifesto.  Persons  with  such  posts  are   likely   to   be
    distinguished from the rank and file of MDC members in the UK and those
    with committee posts at branch and district level.

32. The evidence does not establish with any certainty whether Mandara is a
    high-density suburb. In arguing that it should be regarded as such,  Mr
    Howard drew our attention to statistical data relating to the electoral
    role, the relative municipal  ward  populations  and  the  location  in
    Harare East of New Mabvuku.

33. According to a Zimbabwe Parliament research Department report on Harare
    Province the total population based on the 2002 Census of the city  and
    rural areas including  Chitungwiza  and  Epworth  was  1,896,134.  Some
    1,400,000 live  in  urban  Harare.  There  are  29  House  of  Assembly
    constituencies in Harare province with a total  of  766,478  registered
    voters. Harare East has the largest population and number of registered
    voters exceeded only by Mabvuku Tafara and Epworth which  are  regarded
    as high-density areas. According to chapter 3 of  the  report,   "  The
    city historical background":

         "Harare then Salisbury was developed along racial lines with  large
         open spaces. The reason is that the  spaces  were  left  as  buffer
         zones in a bid to separate blacks and whites (Beacon  Mbiba  2000).
         The whites were mainly found in the north and  north-east  and  the
         blacks  were  found  in  the  South.  There  was  also  an   ethnic
         composition to the city with most Indians in  Belvedere,  Coloureds
         in Arcadia and Adebenie, mixed couples in West End  near  Kambzuma,
         rich blacks in Marimba near Mufakose and  whites  in  the  northern
         suburbs.

         Thirty years after independence the spatial structure still has not
         changed. The change, however, has been on  the  racial  composition
         which is now being replaced by  economic  stratification  into  the
         rich and the poor and others in the middle. The former white  areas
         are now low density areas( 1000pple/km2) and the former Black  area
         are  now  high-density  areas(   >2000   pple/km2).   The   current
         development is now infill residential development in  open  spaces,
         outward growth in areas  of  high  rise  development  in  the  city
         centre."

34. According to the Google maps we have been provided  with,  Harare  East
    (as to be expected) is east of the centre. Mandara is between  downtown
    and Harare East. BC's evidence is that she  and  her  family  lived  on
    Eastern Road which is in Mandara and near to Mandara Shops and  Mandara
    Seventh Day Adventist church. BC and her family belong to  this  church
    in the United Kingdom. In contrast with areas further east  and  south,
    Mandara is laid out with a generously sized street pattern and includes
    Borrowdale racecourse and country club golf course as well as,  to  the
    north,  Ballantyne Park. This  suggests  a  low  density  area  and  is
    consistent with the historic town  planning  described  in  the  report
    above. Mandara does not have its own constituency and no map  has  been
    provided with the report to enable us  to  identify  whether  it  comes
    within Harare Central or Harare East. We think it  more  likely  to  be
    Harare East. We note from the 2013 election  results  from  a  download
    from Nehanda Radio that Harare Central returned an MDC-T candidate with
    6828 votes. The  ZANU-PF  candidate  received  4974  votes.  The  MDC-T
    candidate for Harare East received 9538 votes and the ZANU-PF candidate
    got 8190. In contrast the combined MDC vote in Harare  South  was  just
    over 1800 whereas ZANU-PF received 20,069 votes.

35. The relative street density beyond Eastern Road is greater than in  the
    West. It may be that further east is a less desirable area but it  does
    not necessarily follow that Harare East constituency  comprises  solely
    or is in large part a high-density area. It may  be  that  more  people
    wish to live in a particularly desirable area which might result  in  a
    higher density but it does not follow that such an area is of the  kind
    the Tribunal had in mind in EM.  The election results indicate a strong
    MDC presence. Although BC  describes  Mandara  as  a  relatively  high-
    density area we find that it is not and are satisfied that the area  in
    the immediate vicinity of where she once lived is  not  a  high-density
    area comparable to those for example in South Harare and elsewhere.

36. This is not however a complete answer  to  the  risk  enquiry  we  must
    undertake. In HS (Returning asylum seekers) Zimbabwe  CG  [2007]  UKAIT
    00094, the Tribunal considered the risk on return at the point  of  re-
    entry by reference to AA (Risk for involuntary returnees)  Zimbabwe  CG
    [2006] UKAIT 00061 ("AA(2)") in  which  the  Tribunal  had  heard  oral
    evidence from Professor Terence Ranger, three witnesses who had  worked
    at the old airport at Harare before it was replaced by a newer,  larger
    one and two witness called by the respondent  who  were  able  to  give
    evidence about the respondent's policy  and  procedures  for  enforcing
    removals of Zimbabwean asylum seekers  whose  claims  had  failed.  The
    Tribunal had had a large array of documentary  evidence  about  country
    conditions in Zimbabwe and the evidence of a number of NGOs who may  or
    may not be expected to be aware of whether  there  was  systematic  ill
    treatment of deportees from the United Kingdom. The Tribunal  in  AA(2)
    had analysed of the evidence relating to 39  individual  returnees  and
    then set out its conclusions as follows:


      244. A person who is returned involuntarily to Zimbabwe having made an
      unsuccessful asylum claim in the  United  Kingdom  does  not  face  on
      return a real risk of being subjected to persecution or  serious  ill-
      treatment on that account alone. That is so whether or not the removal
      is escorted. Each case  must  be  considered  on  its  own  facts.  We
      reaffirm the country guidance in SM and Others (MDC - internal flight-
      risk categories)  CG  [2005]  UKIAT  00100.  The  evidence  before  us
      demonstrates that those at risk upon return to  Zimbabwe  continue  to
      fall into the risk categories identified and set out in SM.
      250. If...a political or relevant military profile is suspected, or if
      there are outstanding criminal matters to be  resolved,  the  deportee
      will  be  taken  away  by  the  relevant  branch  of   the   CIO   for
      interrogation. The evidence does not suggest  that  the  CIO  has  any
      interest in manufacturing or fabricating evidence to create  suspicion
      that is otherwise absent.
      251. This second stage interrogation carries with it a  real  risk  of
      serious mistreatment sufficient to constitute a breach of  article  3.
      If the reason for suspicion is  that  the  deportee  has  a  political
      profile considered to be adverse to  the  Zimbabwean  regime  that  is
      likely to be sufficient to give rise to a real risk of persecutory ill-
      treatment  for  a  reason  that   is   recognised   by   the   Refugee
      Convention....Each case must be considered on its particular facts.

37. In HS (Returning asylum seekers) the Tribunal considered it significant
    [104] that the regime had invested considerable resources in seeking to
    infiltrate groups in the United Kingdom to identify those  who  support
    the opposition or who  are  'activists  in  the  country'.  The  regime
    distinguished between those Zimbabweans present in the  United  Kingdom
    generally and those whom they are concerned to identify  as  activists.
    Having examined the evidence afresh  it  reinforced  the  finding  that
    there was a two stage process at the airport and that anyone identified
    during the initial questioning that takes place at the airport as being
    of interest would be taken for  interrogation.  At  that  second  stage
    there is a real risk of serious harm, but not before.

38. The determination was made against the background of what it considered
    to be deteriorating country conditions, [264]. And the  fact  that  the
    CIO had taken over responsibility  for  the  operation  of  immigration
    control at Harare airport and immigration officers were being  replaced
    by CIO officers. The Tribunal accepted [264] that one of  the  purposes
    of the CIO in monitoring arrivals at the airport was to identify  those
    who  are  perceived  to  be  politically  active  in  support  of   the
    opposition. Deportees will have been identified  in  advance  from  the
    passenger manifest and the CIO will have formed a preliminary  view  as
    to which, if any, are of further interest, [265].   Those  of  interest
    would be distinguished from the run-of-the-mill forming part of  nearly
    a quarter of the population of the Zimbabwe which had left the country.
    The Zimbabwean government and its agents  were  fully  aware  that  the
    overwhelming  majority  of  these  were  economic  migrants.  The  vast
    majority of the 50,000 people travelling in and out  of  Zimbabwe  each
    year would be regarded as ordinary passengers and  would  pass  through
    the airport unhindered, [277].

39. According to RN (Returnees) Zimbabwe CG [2008] UKAIT  00083,  those  at
    risk on return to Zimbabwe on account of imputed political opinion  are
    no longer restricted to those  who  are  perceived  to  be  members  or
    supporters of the MDC but include anyone who is unable  to  demonstrate
    support for or loyalty to the regime or ZANU-PF.

40. In EM and Others (Returnees) Zimbabwe CG [2011] UKUT  98  (IAC)  having
    noted at paragraph 51 that the Tribunal in HS had found that the  well-
    resourced, professional and  sophisticated  intelligence  service  that
    comprises the CIO 'would distinguish, when dealing with those returning
    as deportees from the United Kingdom, between those deportees  in  whom
    there was some reason to have interest and those who were of no adverse
    interest simply on that account' it was noted that,  according  to  the
    Tribunal in RN, there could be no doubt that  those  falling  into  the
    risk categories identified and reaffirmed in HS  continued  to  face  a
    real  risk  of  persecutory  ill-treatment  on  return.   It  therefore
    concluded that the country  guidance  regarding  risk  at  the  airport
    accordingly continued to be as set out  in  HS  (Returning  asylum  the
    seekers) read with the findings on that issue in SM and Others.

41. Before the appellant is able  to  reach  her  home  area  where  it  is
    arguable that she will be safe despite her MDC profile, she  must  pass
    through the airport. The combined factors of her  public  MDC  profile,
    the electoral complexion of her former address and her lengthy  absence
    abroad in the United Kingdom makes it reasonably likely  that  the  CIO
    will have already distinguished her before arrival as someone  in  whom
    they may have interest. This is likely to result in questioning  during
    which the appellant will have to decide whether to be  open  about  her
    political allegiances and why she  is  being  returned  to  the  United
    Kingdom or to seek to try and diminish the political profile. Were  she
    to endeavour to do the latter, she may  well  be  unsuccessful  in  the
    light of the public nature of her profile. Any attempt to downplay  the
    role will be because she fears the consequences if she is perceived  as
    someone who has been a key player in the MDC at Provincial level in the
    UK. If the appellant elects to be open about what she has been doing in
    the United Kingdom it is reasonably likely that she will be subject  to
    intense questioning and a risk of ill-treatment. That being so  we  are
    satisfied that she is in need of protection.

42. In the light of this conclusion we do not need to journey that  article
    8. Were they to do so, having  regard  to  the  length  of  the  lawful
    residence in the United Kingdom, the absence of  any  immediate  family
    members in Zimbabwe, the vulnerability of having a young child and  one
    whose birth is imminent taken together create compelling  factors  that
    require particularly careful scrutiny of  the  proportionality  of  the
    Secretary of State's aim of  maintenance  of  immigration  control.  Ms
    Isherwood acknowledged the force of  these  matters  although  did  not
    concede the appeal on this ground.

DECISION

    The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law. We set aside the decision
    and remake it. We allow the appeal on Refugee Convention grounds.
