Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a Pakistani citizen who  was  born  on  2nd  February,
    1987 and who appealed  the  decision  of  the  respondent,  dated  12th
    August, 2014, to refuse to issue a residence card  as  confirmation  of
    his right of residence under European Community law as a family  member
    of an EEA national, herself exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

2.   The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Adio  at
    Hatton Cross on 4th November, 2015.

3.   The respondent's refusal letter of 12th August, 2014,  notes  that  the
    application was made by the appellant on 11th April, 2014.  As evidence
    of his relationship, he submitted a UK marriage certificate.   On  12th
    August 2014, the appellant and his  EEA  sponsor  attended  a  marriage
    interview in Liverpool and  during  the  course  of  that  interview  a
    language test was carried out to establish if the EEA sponsor  and  the
    appellant were able to communicate to a "sufficient" level in order  to
    maintain a relationship.   The  officers  carrying  out  the  interview
    concluded that the EEA sponsor and the appellant could only converse at
    a very basic  level  and  that  this  level  of  conversation  was  not
    sufficient for a genuine relationship to be present.   They  concluded,
    therefore, that the relationship was one of convenience  for  the  sole
    purpose of remaining in the United Kingdom.  There was no evidence that
    the officers were in any way qualified to make such an assessment.

4.   The appellant produced wage slips and bank statements to show that  the
    sponsor  was  exercising  treaty  rights.   The  bank  statements  show
    payments of �200, but the dates of payment did not  coincide  with  the
    wage slips which showed different payment dates and  different  amounts
    of  money  from  those  shown  on  the  bank  statements.   Because  of
    inconsistencies in the evidence, the respondent did not accept that the
    sponsor was shown to have been exercising treaty rights.

5.   Before the hearing before Judge  Adio,  the  sponsor  had  appealed  to
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly on the issue of the genuineness of  the
    marriage.  In Judge Kelly's determination  promulgated  on  9th  March,
    2015, Judge Kelly found that the marriage was genuine.

6.   At the hearing before the judge, Judge Adio made it clear that  he  was
    not concerned with the genuineness  of  the  marriage  since  that  had
    already been decided.  The judge concluded that he  accepted  that  the
    EEA sponsor had provided evidence to show that she had been working  in
    the past, but he noted discrepancies in the P60 and in the letter  from
    the Inland Revenue placed before  him.   The  letter  from  the  Inland
    Revenue was dated 26th August, 2014 and returned to the sponsor the sum
    of �126.72 which had been offered as a payment of income tax.

7.   Ms Ramzan was unable to assist me by indicating what  period  that  tax
    related to.

8.   The judge noted that there was no subsequent  evidence  of  employment.
    He noted that he had no satisfactory evidence of self-employment by the
    EEA sponsor and the only evidence of employment he had was with Qureshi
    Enterprise Limited.  This was in the form of the  last  P60  which  had
    been submitted.  He found that he was not satisfied that at the date of
    the hearing the applicant was able to show that  the  EEA  sponsor  was
    employed or self-employed at the time  of  her  pregnancy,  she  having
    given birth to a child shortly before the hearing  on  12th  September,
    2015.

9.   Unfortunately the appellant and the sponsor chose not to give  evidence
    before Mr Adio.

10.  The grounds suggested that  the  judge  had  materially  erred  in  law
    because on 18th August, 2014 the respondent issued form  IS.96  to  the
    sponsor, informing her that she had been given temporary admission  and
    informing her that she is not permitted to work in the United  Kingdom,
    despite the fact that she is an EEA  national.   The  judge  failed  to
    consider that the sponsor was on temporary admission since 18th August,
    2014 and that even though her appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Kelly in March, 2015, the sponsor was still not permitted to work
    in the United Kingdom.

11.  This evidence  was  contained  within  a  witness  statement  from  the
    sponsor dated 4th February, 2015.  The judge should have taken  account
    of the fact that Judge Kelly found that the marriage  was  genuine  and
    should have taken into account the fact that the appellant had  wrongly
    been served with a notice telling her that she should not work.

12.  As a result, while the  sponsor  was  in  a  position  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Regulations, she was prevented from doing so by the
    Home Office.  The notice of 18th August, 2014 advises the sponsor  that
    she is a person liable to be detained  but  that  she  is  being  given
    temporary admission and  must  report  fortnightly  to  an  Immigration
    Officer.  It quite clearly says:-

         "You are NOT allowed to work or engage in any business  unless  you
         have been explicitly granted permission to do so".

    Ominously this is followed by the following words:-


         "Failure to comply with  any  of  the  above  restrictions  without
         reasonable cause is a criminal offence".


13.  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  suggested  that  it  was  unfortunate  that  the
    appellant had been issued with  form  IS.96.   The  appellant  was  not
    permitted to work or engage in any business, except as an EEA  national
    she was entitled to exercise her Treaty rights.  The  Home  Office  had
    now returned the sponsor's passport to her and if she had been properly
    advised, she should have been advised that she was permitted to work as
    an EEA national.  The fact that she was not able to show that  she  was
    exercising her EEA rights was not the fault of the Home  Office.   Even
    if the Home Office had not prevented her from  working,  she  would  at
    some stage have  required  maternity  leave.   Responding  briefly,  Ms
    Ramzan pointed out quite properly that the appellant  would  have  been
    entitled to 52 weeks' maternity leave.  The fact of the matter is  that
    because she was told not to work she could not,  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing, demonstrate that she was exercising EEA treaty rights.

14.  I reserved my decision.

15.  I have concluded that First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio  did  not  err  in
    law.  As at the date of the hearing before him,  the  evidence  clearly
    demonstrated that the sponsor was not exercising treaty  rights  as  an
    EEA national.  The appellant accepts that she was not.  She  says  that
    she would have been if she had not received a notice telling her not to
    work.  The Home Office  Presenting  Officer  accepts  that  the  notice
    should not have been in the form it was in and that as an EEA  National
    the appellant was entitled to work, notwithstanding the notice IS. 96.

16.  This is a disturbing case and I hope  that  it  is  one  that  will  be
    considered fully and carefully on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State.
    The sponsor should never have been issued with  a  notice  telling  her
    that she was not permitted to work or engage in  any  business,  unless
    specifically granted permission to do so.  The notice pointed out  that
    it was a criminal offence to breach that restriction.  The notice  went
    on to point  out  that  if  the  restrictions  are  to  be  changed  an
    Immigration Officer would write to the sponsor.

17.  A year after the sponsor was successful in her  appeal,  she  is  still
    being required to report to an Immigration Officer and last did  so  in
    May.  Her passport was returned to her earlier this  year,  but  no-one
    within the Home Office has  ever  sought  to  change  the  restrictions
    contained in the  notice  of  18th  August,  2014.   As  a  result  the
    appellant's appeal must as a matter of law be dismissed, but if it  had
    not been for the maladministration on the part of the Home Office,  the
    sponsor might very well have continued  with  her  employment  and  the
    appellant might very well have been successful in his appeal.

Notice of decision

18.  There being  no  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision I uphold it.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

19.  I would respectfully remind the appellant and  his  sponsor  that  they
    may make a fresh application.
