Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Hodson instructed by Elder Rahimi Solicitors.

For the Respondent:    Mr Tan a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a citizen of  Iraq  born  on  10  August  1987  appeals  a
   decision of the Secretary of State, who refused his application for leave
   to remain in the United Kingdom on protection and human  rights  grounds,
   as an exception to the order for his deportation from the United Kingdom.
2. On 24th July 2017 at Leicester Crown Court the  appellant  was  convicted
   on  two  counts  of   conceal/disguise/convert/transfer/remove   criminal
   property;  acquire/use/possess  criminal  property  and  two  counts   of
   knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of a  prohibition/provision
   re: counterfeit goods for which, on the same occasion, he  was  sentenced
   to 41 months imprisonment on three counts to be served concurrently,  and
   15 months imprisonment for two counts to run  concurrently.  A  total  of
   three years and five months imprisonment.
3. The appellant was also  advised  that  section  72  of  the  Nationality,
   Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applied.
4.  The  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  records  at   [8]   of   that
   determination, promulgated on 20 January 2020, that the asylum claim  was
   not being proceeded with and that the  only  issue  was  the  appellant's
   human rights claim.
5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that family life existed between  the
   appellant, his wife and three children. The three children were found  to
   be qualifying children as they are British citizens and  found  that  the
   appellant's deportation would result in unduly harsh consequences for the
   children, and that pursuant to section 117C(3) of the 2002 Act the public
   interest did not require the appellant's deportation.
6. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal.  In  a  decision
   dated 6 July 2020, decided pursuant to rule 34 of  the  Upper  Tribunal's
   procedure rules, Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup set that decision  aside  on
   the basis it was found the First-tier Tribunal had failed  to  apply  the
   correct test and maintain a balanced approach to resolving the  issue  of
   'unduly harsh' such that the decision is fatally  undermined  and  cannot
   stand.
7. The matter was relisted  before  Judge  Pickup  on  16  April  2021,  who
   adjourned the hearing and recused  himself,  the  explanation  for  which
   course of action is set out at [10 - 12] of the adjournment notice in the
   following terms:


   10.   At the outset of the hearing before me, Mr Hodson  indicated  that
         the challenge to the error of law decision remained. The respondent
         does not accept that there was an error of law in the  decision  of
         the First-tier Tribunal,  and  he  intended  to  invite  the  Upper
         Tribunal to revisit the error of law decision in  making  error  of
         law decisions on the papers without an  oral  hearing.  Mr  McVeety
         also indicated that he had instructions from  the  Home  Office  to
         raise this as a preliminary issue. Mr Hodson made application  that
         I  should  recuse  myself  from  the  matter  in  order  that   the
         application to reopen the error  of  law  decision  could  be  made
         before a different judge.


   11.   The parties were reminded that the jurisdiction to depart from  or
         vary the error of law decision is to  be  exercised  only  in  very
         exceptional cases. However, having considered the submissions of Mr
         Hodson and noting that it was unopposed by Mr McVeety, I considered
         that it is arguable. There are such very exceptional  circumstances
         that I should accede to the application to adjourn this  matter  to
         enable the respondent to make  submissions  to  a  different  Upper
         Tribunal Judge that the error of  law  decision  issued  on  7.7.20
         should be remade in an oral hearing following the  opportunity  for
         both parties to make written and oral submissions on the  error  of
         law issue. Whilst there is no requirement that the  application  to
         revisit the error of law decision must be decided  by  a  different
         judge, I consider that it would be consistent with  the  Tribunal's
         overriding objectives to deal  with  cases  fairly  and  justly  to
         enable such a course of action.


   12.   The  remaking  of  the  decision  in  the  appeal  should  proceed
         immediately thereafter. I have issued directions  below  to  enable
         the further management of this case.


      8. Directions were given by Judge Pickup, the third of which is in the
         following terms: "Any application to reopen or remake the error  of
         law decision must be supported by written submissions to be  lodged
         and served no later than seven days before the next hearing".
      9. The issue of the scope of the hearing was raised with  the  parties
         at the outset, during which Mr Hodson stated he was  not  aware  if
         the direction had been complied with and any  application  made.  A
         reading of the  file  indicates  it  has  not.  Further  discussion
         resulted in a pragmatic approach being taken  that  Judge  Pickup's
         error of law finding would stand with the Upper Tribunal  going  on
         to rehear the appeal with a view  to  substituting  a  decision  to
         either allow or dismiss the appeal.

The appellants case

     10. In his latest witness statement dated 8 April 2021,  the  appellant
         confirms he remains living in the family home  in  Nottingham  with
         his wife, LR, their daughter, DK born  on  5  April  2019  and  his
         wife's other two children LH aged 11 and ZS, aged 17.
     11. The appellant refers to the family spending  time  together  during
         the Covid lockdown and his wife having been furloughed and spending
         much of her time with DK, although he states he does his bit too.
     12. LH starts her Secondary School in September 2021  and  ZS,  who  is
         older, is more independent, having a  part-time  job  as  a  carer,
         finishing her A-levels in  2021  and  commencing  an  undergraduate
         course of study at Derby University in September 2021 to which  she
         will travel from the family home in Nottingham.
     13. In 2020 LR took DK to Iraq to enable the appellant's mother to meet
         her new grand daughter for the first time.  The  appellant  records
         that LR would call him constantly saying she did not know what  she
         was  supposed  to  do  or  how  she  should   behave   in   certain
         circumstances and did not understand the language  of  the  family.
         The appellant claims that the trip underlined to LR that she  could
         never live in Iraq long-term as the cultural differences were  just
         too great especially for LH who would be faced with having to  cope
         with a change of education, language and culture at her age,  which
         the appellant fully accepts is the right decision for the family.
     14. The appellant recognises that the issue is that if he  is  deported
         to Iraq the family will be split. The appellant  in  his  statement
         recognises that the relevant question is whether deporting  him  to
         Iraq would result in unduly harsh consequences on LR,  DK  and  LH.
         The appellant's case is that such consequences will arise.
     15. The appellant also notes that since his appeal  before  the  First-
         tier Tribunal he has paid off the full amount of  the  Confiscation
         Order of �19,186.14; ordered following  his  conviction  for  money
         laundering by 15 October 2019, with the assistance of an uncle  and
         friend who he claims lent him the outstanding amount of  �11,312.32
         which included �829.82 interest. The appellant states those friends
         would also be ready and able to offer him paid employment should he
         be allowed to remain with permission to work, which will enable him
         to remain with and support his family, emotionally and financially,
         and to make a positive and law-abiding contribution to the future.
     16. Mr Hodson relies upon his skeleton argument dated  14  April  2021,
         which  sets  out  the  factual  background  to  the   appeal,   the
         immigration decision and grounds  of  appeal,  the  relevant  legal
         framework and at [4] his submissions in support of the  appellant's
         appeal which are in the following terms:

4.   SUBMISSIONS

        4.1  The first issue to be decided  is  whether  the  appellant  is
             liable to  deportation  under  the  Immigration  Act  1971  as
             subject to the provisions of the  UK  Borders  Act  2007.  The
             appellant is not a British citizen.  He has been convicted  to
             a period of imprisonment meeting Condition 1 of s.32(2) of the
             2007 Act and hence his deportation  is  thereby  said  by  the
             Secretary of State to be  conducive  to  the  public  good  in
             accordance with s.32(4) of  the  2007  Act.  It  is  therefore
             accepted that the appellant is at least liable to  deportation
             under section 3 (5) (a) of the Immigration Act 1971.


        4.2  The next issue is whether the appellant's removal would breach
             the Refugee Convention or the  European  Convention  on  Human
             Rights. A person may not be removed if to do so  would  breach
             the UK obligations under either of these  Conventions.  It  is
             submitted that the appellant's removal to  Iraq  would  indeed
             breach the Human Rights Convention.


        4.3  As regards the Refugee Convention and  Article  3  ECHR,  with
             respect to the asylum claim that the appellant had  previously
             made this has been the subject of a determination by the Judge
             of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal promulgated on 20  June
             2008 [see determination at RB/D1 -D8]. The  appellant  is  not
             seeking to produce fresh evidence in support of  his  previous
             claim for asylum nor has he put forward evidence in support of
             any other claim founded on a different factual basis.


        4.4  It will be noted by the Upper Tribunal that it was made  clear
             at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal that the  asylum
             claim was not being pursued [FTT Determination paras. 6 &  8].
             As a result, the issue of whether the respondents  section  72
             certification of that claim did not require to  be  considered
             [FTT Determination ibid]. As regards  the  appeal  before  the
             Upper Tribunal.


        4.5  In the alternative, it is submitted that the  removal  of  the
             appellant from the UK would breach his private and family life
             is established under Article 8 ECHR.


        4.6  In accordance with Binaku (s.11  TCEA:  s,  117C  NIAA;  para,
             399D)  [2021] UKUT 00034 (IAC) , as quoted  above,  the  Upper
             Tribunal is bound to take a structured approach to whether the
             public interest requires the appellant's deportation so as  to
             override his right to a private and family life under  Article
             8, where this approach "in the context of  deportation  begins
             and ends with Part 5A of  the  2002  Act"  (headnote  9).  The
             appellant meets the definition of a 'foreign  criminal'  under
             Section 117D and as such his  deportation  is  in  the  public
             interest for the purposes of Section 117C(1).


        4.7  With reference to Section 117C (2) of  the  2002  Act,  it  is
             accepted that the appellant's offences were serious, and  this
             gives proportionately greater weight to the public interest in
             his deportation.


        4.8  More exactly, the appellant was sentenced to  3  years  and  5
             months' imprisonment for his offences, which were  nonetheless
             the first he had committed and been convicted of. Moreover, he
             had not been sentenced to a period  of  imprisonment  of  four
             years or more,  and  therefore  the  public  interest  in  his
             deportation is  subject  to  both  exceptions  set  out  under
             Sections 117C (4) and (5).


        4.9  With reference to Section 117C(4), it  is  conceded  that  the
             appellant has not lived in the UK for more than half his  life
             so that Exception 1 under Section 117 C (4) does not apply.


        4.10 however, the appellant is married to [LR], a British  citizen,
             who is  such  a  'qualifying  partner'  for  the  purposes  of
             Exception 2 under Section 117C(5).


        4.11 it is further submitted that the appellant is in a genuine and
             subsisting parental relationship with his stepdaughter's - [L]
             and  [Z]  (the  British   children   of   [LR]   by   previous
             relationships) - as well as with his own daughter - [DK] - all
             of  whom  are  'qualifying  children'  for  the  purposes   of
             Exception 2 under Section 117 C (5).


        4.12 Indeed, reliance  is  placed  on  the  findings  made  by  FTT
             Hollingworth in this  respect  ,  which  include  findings  as
             regards the particularly close bond between the appellant  and
             [L] [FTT determination para. 9].


        4.13 the  issue  to  be  decided  is  whether  the  effect  of  the
             appellant's deportation would be  unduly  harsh  on  his  wife
             and/or the children so that Exception 2  does  apply  in  this
             case. This in turn breaks down into whether it would be unduly
             harsh  on  them  to   accompany   the   appellant   to   Iraq.
             Alternatively, whether it would be unduly  harsh  on  them  to
             remain  in  the  UK  without  the  appellant   following   his
             deportation to Iraq alone.


        4.14 the respondent's position on the issue of undue  harshness  is
             somewhat peculiar, and is premised in the  first  instance  on
             the unsustainable proposition that the appellant does not have
             (and did not have) a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
             [L] and [Z] (see Notice  of  Decision  served  12  April  2019
             paras. 81-85 at [RB/W17]). The respondent then argues that "in
             the absence of evidence of a genuine and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with your stepchildren, and given that  they  are
             British citizens who are likely to have developed ties to  the
             United Kingdom and would be  engaged  in  full-time  education
             here, it is considered unduly harsh to expect them to live  in
             Iraq" (Notice of Decision, par.84 at [RB/W17]).


        4.15 the respondent proceeds to consider  the  alternative  whereby
             the appellant does have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with [Z]  and  [L].  The  respondent  opines  "we
             consider that, if their mother and you were to deem it  to  be
             in their best interests to continue family life in Iraq,  then
             it is considered that they would be able to adapt  to  a  life
             there" (ibid).  Even when this statement was made, [Z] was  15
             years old, was about to sit her  GCSEs.  It  is  difficult  to
             imagine an age when it will be harder for a child to adapt  to
             a  completely  different  culture,  language  and  educational
             system.


        4.16  unsurprisingly,  neither  the  children's  mother   nor   the
             appellant deem it to be in [Z] and [L] best interest  to  move
             to live in Iraq should the appellant be deported there. On the
             contrary, both LR and the appellant  had  made  it  abundantly
             clear that this would not be acceptable for these children and
             would certainly be entirely contrary to their best  interests.
             The Upper Tribunal  is  directed  to  the  appellant's  Appeal
             Statement dated 22 July 2019 [AMB/P1-P8] at  his  most  recent
             Supplementary Appeal Statement dated 8 April 2021  [ASB/A1-S5]
             together with the Witness Statement of LR dated 8  April  2021
             [ASB/S6-S9].


        4.17 the Upper Tribunal is also directed to the handwritten  letter
             from Z dated 22 July 2019 [AMB/P16-P18] in which she makes her
             position quite clear  regarding  the  respondent's  suggestion
             that she (and L) could reasonably be  expected  to  adapt  and
             accompany the appellant to Iraq.


        4.18 The Upper Tribunal is, in summary, invited to follow the Judge
             of the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  finding  that  it  would  be
             contrary to the best interests of the children to  attempt  to
             continue their private and family life in  Iraq  and  that  it
             will be unduly harsh on them, and indeed  on  the  appellant's
             wife, to expect them to do so.


        4.19 It is submitted that the real issue  in  this  appeal,  as  in
             others like it, is whether it would be  unduly  harsh  on  the
             appellant's British wife, and in  particular  on  his  British
             stepchildren and British child (D K, now two  years  old)  for
             them to remain in the UK without the  appellant  while  he  is
             deported to Iraq where he will have to remain for ten years or
             more.


        4.20 In assessing whether it would be unduly harsh on the children,
             including D, to remain  in  the  UK  while  the  appellant  is
             deported to Iraq, the Upper Tribunal must consider the  matter
             of undue harshness, and the consequence for the children, from
             the perspective of the children themselves, and without regard
             to the seriousness of the appellant's offence or other related
             matters - KO (Nigeria) & Ors (Appellants) v SSHD (Respondents)
             [2018] UKSC  53  and  RA  (s.117C;  "unduly  harsh";  offence;
             seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 00123 (IAC). The Upper  Tribunal
             is therefore asked  to  give  its  most  careful  and  anxious
             scrutiny to  the  evidence  from  Z  and  L  themselves,  most
             recently in their letters dated 8 April 2021 [ASB/S12 & S14].


        4.21 It is hoped that L will be permitted to give oral evidence  at
             the hearing before the Upper Tribunal in accordance  with  her
             express wishes in her latest letter (supra). In that way,  the
             Upper Tribunal can afford her a full and fair  opportunity  to
             articulate her feelings about the appellant and her fears  for
             a future family life without him. It is submitted  that,  when
             assessing the best interests  of  children  in  matters  which
             intimately affect them, every effort should be made  to  allow
             their voice to be heard.


        4.22 Notwithstanding the admittedly high threshold that has  to  be
             met to show undue harshness in such  cases,  it  is  submitted
             that this threshold is  met  in  this  instance  ,  and  there
             certainly is not only one possible answer to the  question  as
             there was in SSHD v PG (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 1213. On  the
             contrary, it is submitted that the instant case can be clearly
             distinguished on the facts from that of PG (Jamaica).


        4.23 Additionally, it is acknowledged that the  Upper  Tribunal  in
             the reported decision of Imran (Section 117 C  (5);  children,
             unduly harsh) [2020] UKUT 00083 (IAC held  that  "to  bring  a
             case within Exception  2  in  s.117C(5)  of  the  Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the 'unduly harsh' test  will
             not be satisfied, in a case where a child has two parents,  by
             either or both of the following, without more:  (i).  Evidence
             of the particular importance of one parent in the lives of the
             children; and (ii) evidence of the emotional dependence of the
             children that parents have the emotional harm  that  would  be
             likely to flow from separation" (Imran, headnote 1).


        4.24 It is to be noted, however, that the panel in Imran also  held
             that consideration as to what constitutes  'without  more'  is
             fact sensitive (headnote 2).


        4.25 It is submitted that  there  is  more  than  simple  emotional
             dependence and harm involved in this case, although  there  is
             certainly  that  as  well.  In  conducting  a  fact  sensitive
             assessment of this matter, the Upper Tribunal will be directed
             to a number of personal documents in the appellant's Main  and
             Supplementary Bundles and oral submissions.


        4.26 Among the matters which show  that  the  consequences  of  the
             appellant's deportation arguably go beyond  the  'commonplace'
             of emotional fallout is the effect that the stress  associated
             with the appellant's imprisonment has had on his wife  in  the
             past. It is submitted that she will most certainly suffer much
             greater  stress  and  likely  ill  health  from   his   actual
             deportation..


        4.27 The Upper Tribunal is  directed  to  the  correspondence  from
             Elder Rahimi Solicitors to the Home Office between  April  and
             June 2016. Regarding the miscarriage suffered by LR  [AMB/P22-
             P27]. The Upper Tribunal is further referred to the 'Statement
             of Fitness to Work' issued for LR from 2016 and  2017.  It  is
             submitted that it is clear from  these  that  the  appellant's
             wife cannot be expected to  be  unaffected  in  terms  of  her
             health and capacity to work and support her children were  the
             appellant to be deported to Iraq.
        4.28 in addition, the Upper Tribunal is reminded of the  age  range
             of children that the appellant's wife would have to  care  for
             alone, in circumstances in which she would have to  cope  with
             the stress of her  husband's  deportation.  Whilst  the  older
             child, Z, may be about to start university,  she  will  remain
             living at  home  while  she  does  so  (see  off  a  place  of
             University of Derby at  [ASB/S13]).  More  significantly,  the
             middle child L  will  be  starting  her  Secondary  School  in
             September (see email  correspondence  from  Nottingham  County
             Council at [ASB/S15-S18]).


        4.29 It is submitted that this is a particularly crucial  stage  in
             the life of L and that she is, as such, especially  vulnerable
             to  the  adverse  consequences  on  the   family's   stability
             resulting from the appellant's deportation. The Upper Tribunal
             is urged to take a realistic view  of  those  consequences  in
             circumstances in which the youngest child,  D,  is  only  just
             starting preschool (see email  correspondence  [ASB/S19-S20]).
             In particular, the Upper Tribunal is urged  to  consider  with
             special care and anxious scrutiny the  mutual  effect  on  the
             child L and the mother where  the  latter  has  to  cope  with
             caring for a two year  old  while  guiding  her  11  year  old
             daughter through the early years  of  Secondary  schooling  in
             what is manifestly a vital period of her upbringing.


        4.30 As regards Section 117C(6), it is  submitted  that  the  Upper
             Tribunal must consider whether there are any factors over  and
             above Exception 2,  which  are  such  as  to  amount  to  very
             compelling circumstances.


        4.31 It is submitted that the Tribunal must take the best interests
             of the children as being of paramount  consideration  in  this
             appeal. It  is  submitted  that  the  best  interests  of  the
             children are strongly against the deportation of the appellant
             and this is a factor that is not confined to Exception  2  and
             the unduly harsh test.


        4.32 it is submitted that the cumulative effect of the interference
             with the appellant's family and private life entailed  by  his
             removal  and  hence  long-term  exclusion  from  the   UK   is
             unnecessary in a democratic society under Article 8  (2)  ECHR
             being disproportionate to the otherwise legitimate aim of  the
             prevention of disorder or crime.


        4.33 therefore, it is submitted that, while the appellant is liable
             to deportation and the decision is in pursuit of a  legitimate
             aim for the  purposes  of  Article  8  (1),  nonetheless,  the
             decision not only in to fears with  the  family  life  of  the
             appellant,  his  wife,  his  stepdaughters  and  his   natural
             daughter. But the degree and seriousness of  the  interference
             with that shared with  long-term  future  family  life  is  on
             balance, disproportionate to the legitimate aim in issue.

     17. Only the appellant and his wife attended the hearing and were cross-
         examined by Mr Tan and re-examined by Mr Hodson,  after  which  the
         advocates made their submissions to the Tribunal.

Discussion

     18. The skeleton argument of Mr  Hodson  clearly  sets  out  the  legal
         structure to be considered in this appeal, where the main issue  is
         the question of whether the effect of deporting the appellant  from
         the United Kingdom will be unduly harsh upon his wife,  his  child,
         and stepchildren, all of whom form a functioning family unit in the
         United Kingdom.
     19. I agree with the submission of Mr Hodson that the appellant  cannot
         satisfy the requirement of Exception 1 of Section 117 C of the 2002
         Act on the basis of his private life, period of  lawful  residence,
         and in the absence of there being very significant obstacles to his
         reintegration into Iraq, where he clearly  has  family  members  as
         demonstrated by his wife's recent visit to enable  the  appellant's
         mother to see her granddaughter.
     20. Although the appellant claims that his situation is  difficult  and
         that his wife would struggle to be able to care for two children of
         school age, the older child  being  much  older,  independent,  now
         attending university, although living at home, it was not  shown  Z
         would not be able to render some assistance. The prospect facing LR
         is also a situation faced by many  single  mothers  in  the  United
         Kingdom with children of similar ages.
     21. The witness statement of LR confirms that she has  been  furloughed
         from her work at the Metropolitan  Housing  Association  since  the
         beginning of March 2020, but hopes to  return  to  work  from  July
         2021, indicating no bar on her behalf to her being able to work per
         se. Many single parents work with their income being topped  up  by
         Tax Credits with the use of after-care  clubs  or  other  childcare
         arrangements as required. If this was needed in this case, there is
         no evidence that it will be unduly harsh upon  the  family  members
         remaining in the United Kingdom.
     22. It is not suggested the children  will  not  be  able  to  continue
         living with their mother as they do at present.  It is not disputed
         that the best interests of the children are to be able to  continue
         living together within the current family unit but that is not  the
         determinative issue in this appeal, although a factor that has been
         given considerable weight. If the appellant is deported, I find  it
         is in the best interests of  the  children  to  remain  with  their
         mother.
     23. It is not made out that the appellant's deportation will  interfere
         with L's ability to continue to see her natural  father  or  unduly
         impact upon Z's ability to attend  her  university  course  and  to
         achieve the best grades she  can.  There  is  no  evidence  to  the
         contrary.
     24. It is also not made out that Z would not be able to see her natural
         father on a regular basis and the  statement  of  LR  refers  to  Z
         staying with her father twice a week as it  is  easier  to  get  to
         college from his home and given  the  hours  she  is  studying  and
         working.
     25. Whilst LR, as with the appellant, asserts in the statement that the
         decision to deport the appellant was wrong as it would be too harsh
         on her daughters, such a statement is not supported by  any  third-
         party reports, such as from social worker, etc, as noted by Mr Tan.
     26. In relation to LR some of her evidence is out of date  with  regard
         to her medical needs, her oral evidence being that she  is  not  on
         any medication as she would prefer to handle issues herself,  which
         is admirable and demonstrates a willing strength of mind to  enable
         her to overcome such issues.
     27. The letter from Z dated 8 April 2021, referred to in  the  skeleton
         argument, is in the following terms:

I feel it would be very harsh on my family if [] was to be deported  because
this would effect my mum and myself and my sisters as he does a lot for  the
family. It would be extremely hard for  my  mum  if  []  was  sent  back  to
Kurdistan. As she would be alone. As I work part time and will be  going  to
university in September, so I won't be there to help her  as  she  would  be
very stressed, as she also has to go back to work in July. It would also  be
extremely hard for L and D as D would grow up without her dad and  L  has  a
very close relationship with []. We all love  []  very  much  and  would  be
heartbroken if he was sent back to Kurdistan.
Kind regards

     28. Mr Hodson's skeleton argument urges the Upper Tribunal to  consider
         all the evidence with the required degree of anxious  scrutiny  and
         that has been done, even if the same is not  set  out  verbatim  or
         specifically referred to in the decision.
     29. Whilst LR is returning to work, it is not made out that it will  be
         unduly harsh upon her or the children if she has to  give  up  such
         work and become dependent on benefits to enable her to be  a  full-
         time mother for the children if their needs require such action.
     30. The appellant's evidence is that he has friends and family  in  the
         United Kingdom who have helped in  the  past  and  I  do  not  find
         credible his claim that if he was returned to Iraq and his UK-based
         family needed help that such support could not  be  available  from
         those sources if required as he originally claimed, but I also note
         he later on  stated  that  if  the  need  arose  he  believed  some
         assistance could be provided. The  evidence  did  not  support  the
         claim that the family will be abandoned in the  United  Kingdom  if
         the appellant is deported. It is also noted from the evidence  that
         LR was able to work previously for 22 hours a week, part time,  and
         it has not been shown she could not do so again giving her time  to
         meet the needs of the children, or that her own mother, who is  now
         retired and lives in Nottingham (with no evidence  that  she  would
         not be willing) being available to help if needed.
     31. As noted by Mr Tan, the family dynamics continued in terms  of  the
         availability  of  housing  and  adequate  financial  and  emotional
         resources whilst the appellant was in prison and  that  there  were
         sufficient funds to pay for the trip to  Iraq,  indicating  a  good
         income source even though the appellant is prevented from working.
     32. Section 117C Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 reads:


        117CArticle 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign
    criminals

        (1)  The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
    interest.

        (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
             the greater is the public interest in deportation of the
             criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
         most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
         Kingdom, and

             (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
                  deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
             relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
             period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1
             and 2.

       (7)    The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
             into account where a court or tribunal is considering a
             decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that
             the reason for the decision was the offence or offences for
             which the criminal has been convicted.]


     33. The difficulty for the appellant is  the  paucity  of  evidence  to
         support the contention that the  consequences  of  his  deportation
         outlined in the witness statements and oral evidence are sufficient
         to satisfy the threshold of being unduly harsh, either on their own
         for each individual person or cumulatively as a family unit.  There
         is insufficient evidence to support the claim  that  the  emotional
         impact upon  the  children  or  their  mother  of  the  appellant's
         deportation, even if it reminds some  of  the  trauma  of  previous
         breakdowns, will result in unduly harsh consequences.
     34. The finding of Judge Pickup  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         erred in law in appearing to find  that  the  failure  of  the  two
         previous relationships rendered the maintenance of stability of the
         current  relationship  so  important  or   significant   that   the
         separation of the appellant from the children would have an  effect
         far greater than the likely  and  commonplace  consequences  to  be
         expected from the deportation of foreign criminal  with  a  genuine
         and   subsisting   relationship,   resulting   in   unduly    harsh
         consequences, clearly warranted that decision being set aside as  a
         decision that is not legally correct on the evidence.  The  finding
         of the First-tier Judge was not a finding within the range of those
         reasonably available to him  on  the  evidence  when  applying  the
         required legal test correctly.
     35. I have evaluated the assessment of the  impact  of  the  appellants
         removal upon the children by reference to the children themselves.
     36. I have noted the guidance provided by the Court  of  Appeal  in  HA
         (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Rev 1)  [2020]
         EWCA Civ  1176  where  they  cautioned  against  conflating  "undue
         harshness"  with  the  far  higher   test   of   "very   compelling
         circumstances". The underlying concept is of an "enhanced degree of
         harshness sufficient to outweigh the public interest in the  medium
         offender category" [44-56].
     37. I have also when evaluating undue harshness for any of the children
         taken into account the Zoumbas principles, the  best  interests  of
         the child, emotional as well as physical harm,  relationships  with
         other family members in the  UK  and  where  applicable  "the  very
         significant and weighty" benefits of British citizenship.
     38. I have also considered not only the particular relationship between
         the appellant, his daughter and stepchildren, but also  the  domino
         effect that could ensue should he be removed, ie on the  needs  and
         responsibilities of other family members etc. I do not find it  has
         been established on the evidence that  the  consequences,  although
         harsh and will require readjustment within  the  family  unit,  has
         been shown to be unduly harsh.
     39. I do not find it has established on the available evidence that the
         consequences for any family member of  the  appellants  deportation
         from the United Kingdom, whilst having  a  harsh  effect  upon  the
         family members, crosses the threshold  of  being  unduly  harsh  to
         enable him to succeed under Part 5A or the Immigration Rules.
     40.  I  also  find  when  considering  whether  there  are   compelling
         circumstances  sufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in
         the deportation of the appellant in pursuit of the  legitimate  aim
         of the prevention of crime and disorder, especially in light of the
         commission of the serious money laundering  offence  for  which  he
         received a custodial sentence, that  the  Secretary  of  State  has
         discharged the burden of proof upon her to the required standard to
         show that any interference in  a  protected  right  caused  by  the
         appellant's removal from the United Kingdom is proportionate.
     41. I have factored into the balancing  exercise  in  addition  to  the
         points relied upon by the appellant in  his  argument  pursuant  to
         section 117C, the observations  regarding  lack  of  offending  and
         rehabilitation, which is one of a number of factors.
     42. If one reads the appellant's evidence, it is clearly  a  plea  from
         the family members to allow the appellant to remain in  the  United
         Kingdom as they do not want the family to  be  disrupted,  want  to
         preserve the status quo, and will be distressed if he is  deported.
         I find, however, that significant weight is  to  be  given  to  the
         public  interest,  especially  in  the  absence  of  no   form   of
         independent social worker's report or evidence from social services
         or a child psychologist as to the fragility of the children or  any
         unduly harsh impact upon  them  as  a  result  of  the  appellant's
         removal.
     43. I find the appellant has failed to establish that  he  is  able  to
         benefit from any of the exceptions under Part 5A or the Immigration
         Rules  and  that  is  deportation  from  the  United   Kingdom   is
         proportionate.


Decision

     44. I substitute a decision to dismiss the appeal.

   Anonymity.
