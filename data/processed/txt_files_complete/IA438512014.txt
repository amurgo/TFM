For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge C M Phillips (the judge),  promulgated  on  3  September
    2016, in which he dismissed the Appellant's appeal.   That  appeal  was
    against the Respondent's decision  of  21  October  2014,  refusing  an
    application under Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules made on 25  June
    2014.  The application was for leave to remain as the partner of a Thai
    national resident in  the  United  Kingdom  with  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

The hearing before the judge

 2. The Appellant's application had been refused by  the  Respondent  under
    Appendix FM on, in effect, a single  ground.   It  was  said  that  the
    Appellant  had  fraudulently  obtained   an   English   language   test
    certificate following a test taken in August  2012.   This  certificate
    had been used by the Appellant in seeking further leave to remain as  a
    Tier 4 Student in respect of an application made in 2013.  In  essence,
    it is said that the concerns relating to the well-documented ETS  issue
    applied to  this  particular  Appellant.   As  a  result  of  this  the
    Respondent had concluded that S-LTR.2.2 of the suitability requirements
    under Appendix FM applied.  In respect of the five-year  partner  route
    under Appendix FM, no other issues were taken  against  the  Appellant.
    In  light  of  this  the  judge  initially  deals  with  the  issue  of
    suitability (from  paragraphs  43  to  68).   Having  referred  to  the
    evidence before him and relevant case law, the judge  finds  (at  least
    implicitly) that the Respondent had discharged  the  evidential  burden
    resting upon her.  He  then  goes  on  to  take  a  number  of  adverse
    credibility points against the Appellant and concludes ultimately  that
    the Appellant had failed to provide a credible  account  to  rebut  the
    Respondent's evidence.  In light of this the judge then concludes  that
    the Respondent had discharged the legal burden and that she  had  shown
    the Appellant to have used deception in respect  of  the  2012  English
    language test and the certificate submitted thereafter.   Finally,  the
    judge goes on to deal with other Article 8 related matters  (paragraphs
    69 to 90).  A number of factors are considered and ultimately the judge
    concludes that removal would be proportionate.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 3. It must be said that the grounds of appeal are not  particularly  well-
    drafted.  They raise matters relating to the judge's general assessment
    of Article 8, but also make reference to the conclusions on suitability
    under Appendix FM.  Permission to appeal was refused by the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  On granting permission in a decision  dated  12  June  2017,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce comments  that  it  was  arguable  that  the
    judge's use of the term "unconvinced" at various stages of his decision
    raised a concern that too high  a  standard  of  proof  may  have  been
    applied.  In addition, it is noted that S-LTR.2.2  is  a  discretionary
    ground for refusing an application, not a  mandatory  ground.   It  was
    arguable that the judge had failed to appreciate this distinction.




The hearing before me

 4. At the outset of the hearing I raised an issue with the representatives
    that  had   not   apparently   been   appreciated   previously.    Both
    representatives confirmed  that  the  disputed  English  language  test
    certificate related to  the  tests  sat  in  August  2012.   This  test
    certificate had been used by the Appellant when  applying  for  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student in 2013.  The certificate  had  not
    been used in respect of the Appendix FM application made in June  2014.
    In light of this I indicated that the wording  of  S-LTR.2.2  suggested
    that this provision was not applicable to the Appellant's case  because
    the disputed document (the English language test certificate)  had  not
    been submitted in  relation  to  "the  application",  namely  the  2014
    Appendix FM application.

 5. This point had not been in  the  Appellant's  grounds  of  appeal,  and
    although neither representative had spotted the point before  I  raised
    it, it appeared to me as though this matter was of  real  significance:
    on the face of it a suitability  provision  had  been  applied  to  the
    Appellant which should not have been, and the judge  had  proceeded  to
    consider a provision that should not have required  consideration.   Mr
    Hossain agreed with my  observation  as  to  the  applicability  of  S-
    LTR.2.2.  In addition he submitted that even if it did apply, it was  a
    discretionary ground and the judge had failed to  appreciate  this;  he
    had failed to consider whether or not any discretion should  have  been
    exercised in the Appellant's favour.  Mr Hossain also submitted that if
    S-LTR.2.2 did not apply at all, the Appellant's case should  have  been
    allowed outright under Appendix FM given  that  no  other  requirements
    under the five-year partner route had ever been  in  dispute.   It  was
    also submitted that the judge had made errors in respect of credibility
    findings on the ETS issue.  Finally,  Mr  Hossain  submitted  that  the
    judge was wrong in respect of the wider Article 8 issues.

 6. Mr Nath accepted that S-LTR.2.2 may not be applicable in this  case  in
    view of its particular wording.  He made the fair observation  that  he
    had not had any time to consider this issue prior to it being raised by
    myself at the outset of the hearing.  He also noted  that  it  was  not
    included in the grounds of appeal.   Taking  matters  overall  Mr  Nath
    suggested that I could find an error of law in respect of  the  judge's
    decision and then remake the decision by allowing  the  appeal  to  the
    limited  extent  that  the  Respondent's  original  decision  was   not
    otherwise in accordance  with  the  law.   The  Respondent  could  then
    reassess the  case  as  a  whole  and  the  Appellant  would  have  the
    opportunity of submitting any further evidence.   At  the  end  of  the
    hearing I reserved my decision.




Decision on error of law

 7. I conclude that there  are  material  errors  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.  My reasons for this conclusion are as follows.

 8. First, I fully appreciate that the applicability of S-LTR.2.2  was  not
    raised in the grounds of appeal.  I acknowledge that there has been  no
    application to amend those grounds of appeal.  However it seems to  me,
    with all due respect, that  the  judge  was  bound  to  apply  the  law
    correctly (as is the Respondent), and that on the facts  of  this  case
    the particular suitability provision in question had no application  to
    the Appellant's  circumstances.   The  disputed  test  certificate  was
    submitted only in respect of the Tier 4 application made in  2013.   It
    was not submitted in respect of the 2014 Appendix FM  application.   S-
    LTR2.2 reads as follows:

         "Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -

         (a)  false information,  representations  or  documents  have  been
             submitted in relation  to  the  application  (including  false
             information submitted to any person to obtain a document  used
             in support of the application...)".

 9. The clear words used in this provision are "the  application".   Giving
    the terminology its natural and ordinary meaning I  conclude  that  the
    representations or documents relied upon by the  Respondent  must  have
    been submitted together with the latest application, namely that giving
    rise to the decision which is under appeal.  On this interpretation, S-
    LTR.2.2 simply could not have applied to  the  Appellant's  case.   The
    Respondent was wrong in relying upon it when making her  decision,  and
    the judge was wrong in considering it  in  his  decision.   This  basic
    error is clearly of real significance to the Appellant's  case  because
    all other elements of Appendix FM had been accepted.  Therefore, absent
    the suitability issue the Appellant may well have succeeded  under  the
    five-year partner route. The error is material.

10. Second, even if one were to leave aside the applicability point I  have
    set out above, there  is  a  further  material  error  in  the  judge's
    decision.  S-LTR.2.2  is  a  discretionary  ground  for  refusal.   The
    Respondent appears to have overlooked this when making her decision.  I
    can see no reference whatsoever to a discretion or the exercise thereof
    in the reasons for refusal letter.  Moreover, I see no reference by the
    judge as to the discretionary nature of this provision.   I  appreciate
    that I must read the decision as a  whole,  and  clearly  a  number  of
    points are taken against the Appellant generally  and  in  relation  to
    wider Article 8 issues in particular.  However, the specific  issue  of
    the discretion under S-LTR.2.2 has simply not  been  addressed,  as  it
    should have been.  It is not a foregone conclusion that the exercise of
    discretion  would  have  gone  against  the  Appellant  (whether   that
    discretion had been considered by the Respondent or the  judge).  Thus,
    the error is material.

11. In light of the above I set aside the judge's decision.




Disposal

12. There was some discussion at the hearing as to whether I should  remake
    the decision and allow the Appellant's appeal  outright  on  the  basis
    that S-LTR.2.2 did not apply to  the  Appellant's  case  (Mr  Hossain's
    position), or whether I should allow the appeal to the  limited  extent
    that the Respondent's decision was fundamentally  flawed  and  was  not
    otherwise in accordance with the law, as urged on me  by  Mr  Nath.   I
    have decided to take the latter course.

13. I note that because of the timing of the  Appellant's  application  (25
    June 2014) I still have jurisdiction under the old statutory regime  to
    allow the appeal on the limited basis that  the  Respondent's  decision
    was not otherwise in accordance with the law.

14. Having regard to the Respondent's decision, it is quite  apparent  that
    she applied a suitability provision that on  the  face  of  it  had  no
    application to the Appellant's circumstances (even if  there  had  been
    deception practised previously).  Alternatively, it  is  also  apparent
    that the Respondent failed to consider the exercise of  any  discretion
    in relation to S-LTR.2.2.  For these reasons the Respondent's  decision
    was, at the time it was made, unlawful.

15. I am not acquiescing to Mr Hossain's submission because  the  issue  of
    the applicability of S-LTR.2.2 to the Appellant's  case  has  not  been
    raised by the Appellant during the appellate process: it has only  come
    to light through my intervention. This is combined with the fact that I
    have found there to be an alternative error of law in relation  to  the
    discretion point, and this requires the Respondent to apply her mind to
    the consideration of all relevant matters in the first instance.

16. I therefore allow the Appellant's appeal only  to  the  limited  extent
    that the decision  of  21  October  2014  was  unlawful  and  that  the
    Appellant's application, made  on  25  June  2014  remains  outstanding
    before the Respondent, awaiting a lawful decision.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained material errors of law.

I therefore set it aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the  Appellant's  appeal  to  the  limited
extent that the Respondent's decision of 21 October 2014 was  not  otherwise
in accordance with the law.  The Appellant's application  made  on  25  June
2014 remains outstanding before the Respondent, awaiting a lawful  decision.


No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00. The Respondent's original decision has been  found  to  be
unlawful, and the Appellant has succeeded in his appeal on this basis.
