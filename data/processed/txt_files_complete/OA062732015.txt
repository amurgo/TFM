                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The anonymity order imposed by the Upper Tribunal in its decision dated
    23 February 2017 remains in force.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of the Gambia who was born on 17  May  2007.
    On 2 March 2015, she applied for entry clearance to settle  in  the  UK
    under para 297 of the Immigration Rules (HC  395  as  amended)  on  the
    basis that both her parents were settled in the UK.  On 19 March  2015,
    the Entry Clearance Officer refused her application.  That decision was
    affirmed by the Entry Clearance Manager on 22 June 2015.

 3. The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Lodge
    dismissed her appeal under para 297  and  also  under  Art  8.   On  23
    September  2016,  the  First-tier  Tribunal   granted   the   appellant
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 4. In a decision dated 23 February 2017 the Upper Tribunal (UTJs Grubb and
    Chalkley) concluded that the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  law  in
    dismissing the appellant's appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    full reasons are set out in the Upper Tribunal's decision and it is not
    necessary to repeat them here.  The Upper Tribunal set aside the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's decision and adjourned the appeal for  a  resumed
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal in order to remake the decision under
    para 297.

 5. In its earlier decision at paras 16-19, the Upper Tribunal  made  clear
    that the only outstanding matters in relation to para 297 were those in
    sub-paras (iv) and (v), namely whether the  appellant  had  established
    that she met the maintenance  and  accommodation  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

 6. At the resumed hearing, the appellant put into  evidence  a  bundle  of
    documents relating to her parents'  employment  and  accommodation.   I
    admitted those documents without objection under  rule  15(2A)  of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI  2008/2698  as
    amended). At the outset of the appeal, Mr Mills,  who  represented  the
    ECO accepted, on the basis of that documentation,  that  the  appellant
    had established  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  she  met  the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements in para 297(iv) and (v).  He
    accepted that the appeal should be allowed under para 297.

 7. For these reasons, therefore, it is established that the appellant  met
    the requirements of para 297.  The appellant is entitled to  the  grant
    of entry clearance in order to settle in the UK with her parents.

 8. The appellant's appeal is allowed under para  297  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

                                 Dated 30 May 2017








TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeal is allowed and, in the exercise of my discretion, I make  a  full
fee award of any fee paid or payable.

                                 Date 30 May 2017
