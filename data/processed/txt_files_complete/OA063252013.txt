For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State becomes the appellant.
     However, for the avoidance of confusion and ease of reference, I shall
    refer to he parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

Error on a Point of Law

 2. On 20th February 2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Bird  gave
    permission to the respondent to appeal  against  the  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cox in which she allowed the appeal on
    human rights grounds against the decision of the respondent  to  refuse
    entry clearance as a partner  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. Permission was granted because Judge Bird thought it arguable that  the
    judge had not followed the intermediary tests set out in Gulshan [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC) before proceeding to allow the  appeal  on  Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules particularly by failing to  identify  any
    compelling circumstances enabling the Article 8 appeal to succeed.

 4. The appellant submitted a Rule 24 response  arguing  that  the  judge's
    consideration of the appellant's claims outside the  Immigration  Rules
    by applying the decision of Blake J in MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin)  was
    not wrong and that the judge was entitled to find  that  the  sponsor's
    income exceeded the income threshold requirements set out in the  Rules
    of �18,600 in any event.

 5. Mr McVeety submitted that, as the decision of Blake J  in  MM  had  now
    been overturned by the Court of Appeal in MM [2014] EWCA Civ  985,  the
    determination was in error on a point of law.  He further  argued  that
    the appeal should be dismissed on re-making as the appellant had failed
    to meet the financial requirements of  the  Rules  which  had  not,  in
    themselves, been found to be disproportionate.

 6. Mr Samra argued that the judge had  not  relied  upon  the  High  Court
    decision in MM because, at paragraph 65 of the determination,  she  had
    found that the income of the sponsor was sufficient because it exceeded
    the amount specified in the Rules, even if receipt of that  income  had
    not been proved as required by the Rules.

 7. Mr McVeety argued that the judge had plainly applied  the  decision  of
    Blake J in MM to allow  the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds  and  this
    amounted to a material error.

 8. I indicated that I was satisfied that the determination showed an error
    on a point of law such that it should be re-made.  That was because the
    judge's determination is clearly built around the decision of  Blake  J
    in MM on the basis that, although the appellant could not succeed under
    the Rules, she was able to show income figures sufficient to  meet  the
    amount required under the Rules and thus the respondent's decision  was
    disproportionate.  Whilst the judge was not  wrong,  at  the  time,  to
    consider the High Court decision in MM that has been overturned by  the
    Court of Appeal on the basis that the Rules are not disproportionate in
    themselves.

Re-making the Decision

 9. Mr Samra conceded that the appellant could not succeed under the Rules,
    particularly the specific requirements for documentary proof set out in
    Appendix FM-SE at paragraph 2 requiring bank  statements  corresponding
    with the same period as wage slips to be produced to show  that  salary
    had been paid into an account in the name of  the  sponsor.   That  was
    because  the  sponsor  was  paid  in  cash.   He  argued  that  such  a
    requirement was disproportionate  when  receipt  of  pay  for  a  self-
    employed person did not have that requirement.  Mr Samra also  reminded
    me of the circumstances of the appellant's  application  including  the
    fact that the parties had lived together in the United Kingdom in  2012
    before the appellant returned to India to make his application on  11th
    October.

Conclusions and Reasons

10. The appellant  cannot  succeed  under  the  Rules  because  the  income
    information provided by the  sponsor,  even  if  the  amounts  involved
    exceed the �18,600 annual income requirement, had not  been  proved  in
    the manner required by the Rules in Appendix FM-SE.  In this respect Mr
    Samra is wrong to suggest that it is unfair for those who are  employed
    to prove their income by receipt in  a  bank  account  when  the  self-
    employed do not need to do so.  Paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE  makes  a
    similar requirement for self-employed to show their  income  from  such
    employment  has  been  paid  into  a  bank  account  in   their   name.
    Additionally, the Rules can now be regarded as not disproportionate  in
    themselves.  The requirement for income from employment to be  received
    into a bank account is reasonable in order to avoid any  irregularities
    which might arise with payment in cash and the production of unreliable
    wage slips.  The respondent is entitled to take reasonable steps to  be
    satisfied that income claimed is income received.  This  appeal  cannot
    succeed under the Rules.

11. As to Article 8 issues in general I apply the five stage Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27 tests. There is no  longer  any  need  for  intermediary  tests
    before  consideration  outside  the  Rules.  Whilst  the   respondent's
    decision can be said to be a breach of the parties' Article 8 rights to
    live together in a  family  as  husband  and  wife  and  that  such  an
    infringement has consequences of such gravity as potentially to  engage
    the operation of Article 8, I am unable to conclude that  the  decision
    is disproportionate for the reasons which follow.

12. In reaching my conclusion I should point out that  no  issue  has  been
    taken with the judge's conclusion that the parties were  in  a  genuine
    relationship despite the respondent's contention to  the  contrary.   I
    have assumed that the parties are in a subsisting  relationship  albeit
    living apart.

13. The evidence put before the First-tier Tribunal showed that the sponsor
    was aware that the  appellant  was  in  the  United  Kingdom  illegally
    shortly after she had met him in November 2010.  She was not,  at  that
    stage, divorced from her first husband.  The appellant  then  left  the
    United Kingdom in September 2012 to return to India where  the  parties
    married in September 2012.  They  had  lived  together  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a short period before  his  departure.   The  parties  have
    maintained contact with each other by modern methods  of  communication
    since and the sponsor visited India and the appellant in October  2013.



14. These circumstances lead me to conclude that the parties  were  clearly
    aware that they had no right to live together  in  the  United  Kingdom
    despite their marriage unless they could comply  with  the  Immigration
    Rules in their new format applicable at  the  date  of  application  in
    October 2012.  The parties knew or ought to have known of the  specific
    requirements of the Rules they were  required  to  meet  but  did  not.
    However, the parties can now re-apply providing the  evidence  required
    is in the format specified to ensure the grant of entry  clearance  for
    the appellant.  If the sponsor is paid in cash then no doubt  she  will
    make arrangements to be paid into her bank account as the Rules require
    for proof of such income.  Any further separation which will be brought
    about because of the need to take steps to comply with the  Rules  will
    not lead to a disproportionate  breach  of  Article  8  rights  as  the
    parties can continue their relationship in the same way  as  they  have
    done since the appellant returned to India.

15. For the reasons given above I conclude that the  respondent's  decision
    is not disproportionate and so the appeal is dismissed on human  rights
    grounds.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error  on  a  point  of
law such that  it  should  be  re-made.   I  re-make  the  determination  by
dismissing it on immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

Anonymity was  not  requested  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  nor  do  I
consider it appropriate before the Upper Tribunal.
