For the Appellant:     Mr K Forrest, Advocate, instructed by Freedom
Solicitors, Birmingham
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Kurdish citizen of Iran, aged 22 at the time of  the
    hearing in the UT.  Judge Mackenzie dismissed his appeal to the FtT  by
    a decision promulgated on 28 January 2019.

 2. In an application dated 21 May 2019, the appellant asked for  extension
    of time to apply and for permission to appeal to the UT on 3 grounds.

 3. On 24 June 2019 the UT  extended  time  and  gave  permission  on  each
    ground, but in particular regarding:

         "... the FtT's consideration of risk  on  return  as  an  insincere
         political activist.  It is arguable that the authorities might  not
         be as discerning as the Judge suggests at [56]."

 4. In an application under cover of a  letter  dated  7  August  2019  the
    appellant seeks to adduce "evidence" under rule 15 (2A):

    (i)    a witness statement by the appellant about his activities in the
    UK;

    (ii)   documentary evidence of the appellant's online activities; and

    (iii)  the report of HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 00430.

 5. Mr Forrest accepted that the further  evidence  would  become  relevant
    only if and when the decision fell to be remade, not at  the  error  of
    law stage.

 6. Case law is not evidence.  HB was published on 12 December  2018.   The
    FtT heard the case on 3 December 2018 and was actively considering  its
    decision at least up to 3 January 2019 - see [16].  While  this  is  to
    impose a high standard, it is the duty of the FtT to consider and apply
    country guidance  even  if  not  prompted  by  parties  and  even  when
    published after a hearing but  prior  to  finalising  a  decision.   Mr
    Govan, realistically, did not argue against the  FtT's  decision  being
    tested by reference to HB.   He submitted that did not indicate another
    outcome.

 7. Mr Forrest supplied a skeleton argument,  which  says  that  the  judge
    erred in law for two reasons: firstly, taking grounds 1 and 2 together,
    on "the nature and extent of the appellant's political  activity",  and
    secondly, by failing to consider and apply country guidance.

 8. Further to the first aspect, and to his skeleton, Mr Forrest noted that
    the claim based on activities in Iran had been exhausted, and that  the
    remaining case was based on sur place activities only.   He  said  that
    the judge recorded the evidence of Facebook activity  in  the  UK,  and
    said she gave it very careful consideration, but went  on  without  any
    further comment to deal with the evidence of two witnesses,  which  she
    did not accept.  She did not return to the Facebook evidence other than
    to say at [49] it was not clear how that was "in  the  public  domain",
    which was the wrong approach.   It  was  a  misunderstanding  that  the
    appellant had to prove such evidence was in  the  public  domain.   The
    cases to which she referred indicated that risk arose from materials in
    the  private  domain.   The  pinch  point  of  risk  was   return   "in
    circumstances where the Iranian authorities were particularly sensitive
    to persons (such as the appellant) who have spent a long  time  outside
    Iran".  AB [2015] UKUT 257, although not a CG case, indicated that such
    persons might have to disclose their  internet  history,  i.e.  matters
    such as Facebook postings which are  in  the  private  not  the  public
    domain, and so would be forced to disclose  postings  critical  of  the
    Iranian government and supportive of PJAK.  In so far as  it  might  be
    open to the appellant to delete his postings, he could not be  expected
    to lie - AB at [457].

 9. Turning to country guidance, Mr Forrest submitted that applying HB, the
    appellant was a national of Iran and a Kurd; he has  been  absent  from
    Iran since 2015; on return, he is likely to be detained; he has engaged
    extensively on Facebook against the authorities and in support of PJAK,
    or at least the FtT had given no reasons for finding that  he  had  not
    engaged in such activity; applying AB and HB, he would be at risk;  the
    decision of the FtT did not fall to be  reversed  outright,  but  there
    were errors which called for remittal.

10. Mr Govan submitted along these  lines.   The  judge  correctly  applied
    Devaseelan.  She did not fail to make findings  about  the  appellant's
    Facebook.  It was implicit, but clear, that she accepted  he  made  the
    postings.  There was no error in her finding that  he  had  no  genuine
    beliefs.  That did not exclude protection, but the  appellant  did  not
    benefit from any doctrine of not being expected to lie.  Deleting posts
    was a different matter.  There was nothing wrong with finding  that  he
    would do so.  There was no reason to think that he would  unnecessarily
    put himself in harm's way.  Case law said that  protection  was  needed
    when there were factors over and above  ethnicity.   Fabricated  claims
    did not  constitute  such  a  factor.   There  was  evidence  that  the
    authorities used sophisticated methods, knew about Facebook, and  might
    ask a suspect to log in, but there was no evidence of ability  to  pick
    up on information within a private account, or which had been  deleted.
     The appellant had not established where the "risky"  photographs  came
    from, or that they were now accessible to the authorities.   There  was
    no error in the FtT's findings  on  the  facts,  and  applying  country
    guidance to those findings, no entitlement to protection.

11. I reserved my decision.

12. The grant of permission was on the view that arguably  the  authorities
    on questioning the appellant might persecute him on a  disclosure  even
    of  insincere  political  activism.   That  perhaps  remains  debatable
    ground, but the findings in this case do not bring the appellant to the
    pinch point of risky disclosure.

13. I accept, as Mr Govan said, that the FtT did find, clearly enough, that
    the appellant  has  made  risky  postings  on  Facebook.   He  did  not
    establish, however, a real risk of those coming  to  attention  of  the
    Iranian authorities.

14. The FtT at [54] said there was no  reason  for  the  appellant  not  to
    delete his Facebook account.

15. That is a sound finding.  Having been found to have set up the  account
    in bad faith, there is no reason to think that he would not  take  that
    elementary precaution before return.

16. Mr Forrest accepted that the appellant  did  not  in  the  FtT  seek  a
    finding about the manner of his  exit  from  Iran,  and  that  no  such
    finding was made.  He has been found generally not  credible.   He  did
    not show that the only course available to him is return  on  a  travel
    document marking him out as a failed asylum seeker, rather  than  on  a
    passport.  There is no presumption  of  enforced  return.   Refusal  to
    return voluntarily, where available, does not contribute to a claim for
    protection: see Macdonald's Immigration  Law  and  Practice,  9th  ed.,
    �12.24 & �12.28, and cases there cited.

17. If not marked out as a failed asylum  seeker,  it  is  not  likely  the
    Iranian authorities would ask the appellant for details of his  history
    in the UK.

18. There is a general principle of not being expected to  lie,  by  making
    false  claims  of  political  allegiance,  or  by   denying   religious
    convictions or  sexual  identity.   However,  the  appellant  cited  no
    authority which would entitle him to a presumption that  if  asked,  he
    would volunteer to his national authorities, against his own interests,
    details of activities he undertook in bad faith.  That  notion  appears
    to be a considerable stretching of the case law.

19. There would be no sensible reason to find as a fact that the  appellant
    would volunteer such information.

20. Somewhat similar arguments in cases of activities at low level  and  in
    bad faith were rejected by the UT and by the Court of Appeal in SSH and
    HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC)
    (see the headnote, and �23, 29-30, and 34) and in AS (Iran) [2017] EWCA
    Civ 1539 (�32-33).

21. The FT found at [57] no  risk  on  return  on  account  of  (insincere)
    political opinion and at [58] no risk even as a  Kurdish  returnee  who
    had left illegally (if such are the facts about  his  exit  and  likely
    return).  The grounds and submissions for the  appellant  do  not  show
    that those conclusions should be set  aside  for  having  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law. The decision  of  the  FtT  shall
    stand.

22. Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him or any member of his  family.   This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
