                                             Decision Promulgated:

      DETERMINATION AND DIRECTIONS FOR REMITTAL TO FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL



The parties were in agreement that the First-tier Tribunal materially  erred
in law in determining the appeal on  the  papers  rather  than  at  an  oral
hearing. I found that the determination dated 18  June  2013  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Pirotta should be  set  aside  as  it  disclosed  a  material
procedural error and that the appeal should be re-made.

The parties were  also  in  agreement  that  as  the  error  was  such  that
appellant had been deprived of a substantive hearing before  the  First-tier
Tribunal, the appeal should remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  re-
made following paragraph 7.2 of Part 3 of the  Senior  President's  Practice
Statement dated 25 September 2012.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law such that it is set aside.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-made.

DIRECTIONS

The appeal will be heard at the  Birmingham  hearing  centre  on  Monday  16
September 2013 before a Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pirotta.


By 9 September 2013, the appellant is to file with the  Tribunal  and  serve
on the respondent an indexed and paginated bundle of all materials that  are
to be relied upon.
