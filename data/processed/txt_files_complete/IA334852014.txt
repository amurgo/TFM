                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision of Judge Buckwell  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 16th September 2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FtT and I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female citizen of Nigeria born 9th October 1974.   On
    17th October 2013 the Claimant applied for further leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom based upon her marriage to  Anthony  James  Richards
    (the Sponsor) a British citizen.  The marriage between the Claimant and
    Sponsor had taken place on 4th April 2013.

 4. The application was refused on 8th August 2014.

 5. In giving reasons for refusal the Secretary of State explained that the
    Claimant needed to demonstrate an annual income  of  �18,600,  but  the
    evidence submitted showed a gross annual income of  �16,982.   Although
    the Claimant had  demonstrated  possession  of  �4,012.61  in  savings,
    because this amount was less than �16,000, the  savings  could  not  be
    taken into account.  Therefore the application was refused on financial
    grounds.

 6. The Secretary of State went on to consider section EX.1 and noted  that
    the Claimant and the Sponsor did not have children.  The  Secretary  of
    State concluded that there were no insurmountable obstacles to  prevent
    the Claimant and  Sponsor  pursuing  family  life  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.  Therefore it was decided that the Claimant could not  benefit
    from EX.1.

 7. The Secretary of State considered the  Claimant's  private  life  under
    paragraph 276ADE(1) noting that the Claimant  had  only  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom for seven years.  It was not accepted that the  Claimant
    could satisfy any of the  provisions  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)  and  in
    particular it was not accepted that there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the Claimant's integration back into Nigeria if she had to
    leave the United Kingdom.

 8. The Secretary of State did not consider that there were any exceptional
    circumstances which would justify granting the application outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

 9. The Claimant appealed and the appeal was  heard  by  the  FtT  on  25th
    August 2015.

10. The Secretary of State was not represented at the  hearing  before  the
    FtT.

11.  Having  heard  oral  evidence  from  the  Claimant,   and   considered
    documentary evidence, the FtT  concluded  that  the  Claimant  had  not
    presented evidence with her application that proved  an  income  of  at
    least �18,600 per year.  However fresh evidence was produced to the FtT
    at the hearing showing that the Claimant had two  jobs,  and  therefore
    had a combined income which exceeded �18,600.

12. The FtT decided that it was entitled to take the  fresh  evidence  into
    account by virtue of section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).  The FtT therefore allowed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules noting that the  Claimant's  representative
    specifically confirmed that the Claimant  did  not  pursue  her  appeal
    pursuant to Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on  Human  Rights
    (the 1950 Convention).

13. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  It was contended that the FtT had erred by finding that  the
    Claimant  could  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  due  to  the
    production of post-decision evidence.  It was contended that the  rules
    limited the evidence to a six month period prior  to  the  application,
    and therefore the requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not satisfied and
    the FtT was wrong in law to have allowed the appeal.

14. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Nicholson of the FtT  in  the
    following terms;



         "1.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell  allowed  this  Appellant's
             appeal against refusal of leave to  remain  as  a  spouse  and
             removal to Nigeria in a decision promulgated on 16th September
             2015.

         2.    The  judge  found  that  the  Appellant  met  the   financial
             requirements under  Appendix  FM-SE  on  the  basis  of  post-
             decision evidence.

         3.   The grounds contend that the judge erred in relying  on  post-
             decision evidence.

         4.   Pursuant to paragraph 2 of  Appendix  FM-SE,  the  Appellant's
             ability to meet the financial requirements of the rules was to
             be assessed by reference to pay  slips  and  bank  statements,
             which  preceded  the  date  of  the  application.   In   those
             circumstances,  it  is  arguable  that  the  judge  erred   in
             assessing  the  Appellant's  ability  to  meet  the  rules  by
             reference to documents which post-dated the application.

         5.   Permission to appeal is accordingly granted."

15. Directions were issued that there should be an oral hearing before  the
    Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether the FtT had erred in law such  that
    the decision should be set aside.

Submissions

16. Mr Wilding relied upon the grounds contained within the application for
    permission to appeal.  It was accepted that evidence could be submitted
    after an application had been lodged,  but  that  the  evidence  relied
    upon,  must  relate  to  the  six  month  period  before  the   initial
    application was made.

17. I was asked to find that it was clear from the  evidence  submitted  to
    the FtT, that the evidence did not relate to  a  period  prior  to  the
    application being made, and therefore the requirements of Appendix  FM-
    SE were not satisfied, and the FtT should  have  dismissed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

18. Mr Wilding pointed out that the only issue before the  FtT  related  to
    the financial aspect of Appendix FM, and therefore requested  that  the
    decision of the  FtT  be  set  aside,  and  a  further  decision  made,
    dismissing the Claimant's appeal.

19. Mr Adisa confirmed that no response had been made pursuant to  rule  24
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  but  explained
    that it was not accepted that the FtT had erred in law.

20. Mr Adisa relied upon section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 submitting that unless an appeal related  to  an  entry
    clearance case, or a points-based system application, a Tribunal  could
    take into account evidence as at the date of the appeal hearing.

My Conclusions and Reasons

21. The FtT erred in law and did so materially.  The FtT was wrong to allow
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

22. The  Claimant's  application  was  refused  because  E-LTRP.3.1,  which
    requires a specified gross annual income of at least �18,600 could  not
    be satisfied.  That is not disputed by the Claimant.

23. It is common ground that the Claimant produced fresh  evidence  at  the
    hearing before the FtT, which indicated that there was an annual income
    in excess of �18,600 but the evidence submitted to prove this, did  not
    relate to the six month period prior to the application being made  for
    leave to remain.

24. In an appeal of this nature,  it  is  open  to  a  Claimant  to  submit
    evidence up to the date of hearing, but that evidence must  prove  that
    the Immigration Rules are satisfied.

25. In this case it is paragraph 2 of Appendix  FM-SE  which  is  relevant.
    This provides that in respect of salaried employment in the  UK,  which
    was relied upon by the Claimant, pay slips covering  a  period  of  six
    months prior to the date of application must be  submitted  if,  as  in
    this case, the individual submitting the pay slips had been employed by
    the current employer for at least six months.

26. In addition bank statements must be submitted covering the same  period
    of employment.

27. The Claimant submitted her application on 17th October 2013.  Therefore
    the evidence of employment should have related to the six months  prior
    to 17th October 2013, and the bank statements should have  covered  the
    same period.

28. The evidence did not cover that period, and therefore the evidence  did
    not prove that the Immigration Rules were satisfied.  The FtT erred  in
    accepting that this fresh evidence, produced at the hearing,  satisfied
    the Immigration Rules.

29. For that reason, the decision of the FtT is set aside.  It was accepted
    by the parties that the only  issue  before  the  FtT  related  to  the
    financial  requirements,  and  I  therefore  re-make  the  decision  by
    dismissing the Claimant's appeal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of  law
and was set aside.

I re-make the decision.  The Claimant's appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity order was made by the FtT.  There has been  no  application  to
the Upper Tribunal for anonymity and I make no anonymity order.
