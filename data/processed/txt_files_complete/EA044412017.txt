Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr M Ntochukwu, instructed by Voice for the
Voiceless UK
For the respondent:    Mr J Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a decision to which both judges have contributed.

 2. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Steer promulgated 24.5.18, dismissing his appeal against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 24.4.17,  to  refuse  his
    application made on 25.10.16  for  an  EEA  Permanent  Residence  Card,
    pursuant to a retained right of residence as the former  spouse  of  an
    EEA national following termination of marriage, pursuant to regulations
    10 and 15 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Alis granted permission to appeal on 31.7.18.

 4. The appeal was  listed  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  before  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge O'Ryan, who in the decision promulgated  27.11.18  found
    such error of law in the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  to
    require it to be set aside and remade in the Upper Tribunal.  For  that
    purpose directions were given  for  the  provision  of  a  replacement,
    consolidated bundle of all materials relied  on  by  the  appellant  in
    support of the appeal, as set out in Judge O'Ryan's decision.

 5. Judge O'Ryan clearly intended the resumed appeal hearing to  be  listed
    before him but, as that has not been practically possible without undue
    delay, the Principle Resident Judge made a transfer  order  on  28.2.19
    for the appeal to be heard by a differently constituted tribunal.

 6. At  the  hearing  before  us,  Mr  Ntochukwu  submitted  the  following
    documents to which we have given careful consideration:

      a) The revised bundle, comprising 78 pages;

      b) The skeleton argument;

      c) A copy of the Home Office Guidance on retained rights of residence,
         dated February 2019;

      d) The following case law: NA (Pakistan) [2014] EWCA Civ 995; OA  (EEA
         -retained rights of residence)  Nigeria  [2010]  UKAIT  00003;  and
         Baigazieva [2018] EWCA Civ 1088.

 7. It was common ground that the appellant was previously married to NM, a
    Spanish national. We were assisted by Judge  O'Ryan's  summary  of  the
    factual issues, set  out  at  [11]  of  his  decision,  of  which  both
    representatives agreed the following were  relevant  in  light  of  the
    concessions previously made and the current case law:

      a) What was the date of the commencement of  the  divorce  proceedings
         which led to the termination of the marriage by decree absolute  on
         16.11.16 (applying Baigazieva);

      b) Whether the appellant's former spouse (NM) was a  qualified  person
         at that date;

 8.  Judge  O'Ryan  had  recorded  that  whether  the  appellant  met   the
    requirements of regulation 10(6) so that he would, if an EEA  national,
    be a qualified  person  under  the  regulations  was  not  in  dispute.
    Applying Gauswami (retained right residence - jobseekers) India  [2018]
    UKUT 295, the relevant  date  for  that  is  the  date  of  the  decree
    absolute, at which point the appellant was no longer the family  member
    of the EEA national. Mr Whitwell confirmed  that  on  the  unchallenged
    evidence that the appellant has been lawfully employed as a manager  by
    Tesco for several years this requirement was met. It follows that  this
    is not an issue requiring resolution in this appeal.

 9. On that basis it was also not in contention that if the  appellant  can
    bring himself within regulation 10(5) he would not only have a retained
    right of residence but a right to permanent residence under  regulation
    15, having resided in the UK in accordance with the regulations  for  a
    continuous period  of  five  years.  However,  Mr  Whitwell  challenged
    whether the evidence  available  was  sufficient  to  demonstrate  that
    regulation 10(5) is met.

Findings and Reasons

10. On the evidence and for the  reasons  summarised  below,  we  were  not
    satisfied that  the  appellant  has  demonstrated  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities  that  NM  was  a  qualified  person  at  the   date   of
    commencement of divorce and thus find that regulation 10(5) is not  met
    and the appeal must fail.

The Relevant Date

11. Baigazieva records the concession of the respondent that  in  order  to
    meet the requirement for a retained right  of  residence  arising  from
    regulation 10(5) a third country national does not need to  demonstrate
    that the former EEA spouse exercised  Treaty  rights  as  a  'qualified
    person' until the divorce itself. Rather, it is sufficient to show that
    the  former  EEA  spouse  exercised  Treaty   rights   "until   divorce
    proceedings were commenced."

12. From the documentary evidence we find that the petition for divorce  at
    [30] in  the  appellant's  bundle  bears  a  signature  dated  23.2.15.
    However, it was received by the court on  8.4.15  and  the  proceedings
    were not issued until 22.4.15.

13. Mr Ntochukwu argued, relying on Article 13(2) of the Directive on which
    regulation 10(5) is based, that the relevant date for  the  termination
    of marriage was the date on which  the  appellant  signed  his  divorce
    petition. However, we reject that argument as  the  document  could  be
    signed at any time prior to issue, in theory months  if  not  years  in
    advance. The date at which the legal proceedings for divorce  commenced
    is that of the formal issue of the  divorce  proceedings,  22.4.15.  We
    considered but in the light of the evidence as a whole and the  matters
    set out below, we rejected as not credible the appellant's  claim  that
    he had provided the signed document to his  legal  representatives  and
    fully expected the petition to have been lodged immediately.  There  is
    no evidence of any legal  representative  involvement  in  the  divorce
    proceedings. The address given for service is that of the appellant. It
    would have been open to the appellant to support his factual  claim  of
    the history of lodging the petition by adducing evidence from his legal
    representative or some other documentation that shows he had instructed
    legal representation at that time. No such evidence was adduced.

14.  In  the  circumstances,  we  find  that  the  relevant  date  for  the
    commencement of divorce proceedings is that  of  22.4.15  and  we  have
    considered the evidence overall on that basis.

The Appellant's Oral and Documentary Evidence

15. Mr Ntochukwu chose to present his case by calling the  appellant  as  a
    witness, relying on his new statement of 5.4.19. Further questions were
    asked in chief and he was cross-examined by Mr Whitwell. A full note of
    the oral evidence and subsequent submissions of the two representatives
    is with the tribunal's case file and need not be recited here.

16. However, we found the appellant a poor and inconsistent witness in  his
    own cause. His evidence was at times  internally  inconsistent  and  at
    other times inconsistent with the documentation he relies on.

17. We note, for example,  that  the  divorce  petition  asserts  that  the
    appellant and his former spouse last lived together at  an  address  in
    Peckham which is the address given for service on the respondent to the
    petition. The basis of the petition is that the parties had lived apart
    for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the
    presentation of the petition; see page 33. The narrative  statement  of
    case at 34 claims that the appellant moved out of the matrimonial  home
    on 7.1.13 and they had lived apart since then. However, the appellant's
    oral evidence was somewhat different. He told the tribunal that he  and
    his wife separated a week before the signing of the petition,  i.e.  in
    February 2015. However, he told Mr Whitwell that he only spoke  to  his
    wife once in 2015 and that was over the phone sometime, he thought,  in
    January, but was not sure of the month. When the statement of  case  in
    the divorce petition was put to him he had  no  answer  other  than  to
    repeat that he was trying to work things out with  his  wife.  He  said
    repeatedly that he followed after her and tried to make  it  work,  but
    failed to provide any clear answer as to  whether  they  had  cohabited
    since January 2013. In re-examination he confirmed that he  only  spoke
    to his wife once in 2015. Asked if they had lived together after filing
    the divorce petition he said he tried but it didn't work.  Specifically
    asked again if they had lived together  at  any  time  or  place  after
    January 2013, he said they did but when asked  for  details  said  only
    that he tried to meet her but it didn't work. It appeared  to  us  that
    the appellant was being vague  and  evasive,  perhaps  because  of  the
    inconsistency between his account and the documentary evidence. We were
    not satisfied that the appellant was stating clearly that had  had  any
    contact with his wife since separating in January 2013,  other  than  a
    single phone call some time before  signing  the  divorce  petition  in
    February 2015. There was no explanation for the  inconsistency  in  his
    account, telling the tribunal that he and his  wife  separated  a  week
    before he signed the petition.

18. Given that there is no challenge to the fact of marriage or that it  is
    other  than  genuine,  and  given  the  specific  requirements  of  the
    regulations as clarified by the case law referred to above,  we  accept
    that whether and when and for how long the appellant and his wife  were
    cohabiting is not directly relevant to the question whether she  was  a
    qualified person at  the  date  of  the  commencement  of  the  divorce
    proceedings. However, this issue bears  on  not  only  the  appellant's
    overall credibility but also directly on the reliability of  his  claim
    that he knew that his  former  wife  was  working  as  a  self-employed
    hairdresser and 'general house assistant' at the date  of  commencement
    of the divorce proceedings.  Asked  repeatedly  how  he  knew  she  was
    working at that time, his answers were  unsatisfactory  and  vague.  Mr
    Whitwell submitted in closing that it came down to  no  more  than  the
    appellant saying that he knew because he knew. He told the tribunal  he
    had not discussed her employment in the one  phone  call  they  had  in
    early 2015. He also made it clear that he had not asked her at any time
    for evidence of her continuing employment for the purpose  of  his  EEA
    application.

19. The appellant has been unable to produce any  documentary  evidence  to
    support the claim that his former spouse was working  at  the  date  of
    commencement of divorce proceedings, which we have found must be  taken
    as 22.4.15, other than the HMRC document at page 27 of the bundle. This
    only covers the period to the end of the tax year 5.4.15 and  does  not
    extend to the date the divorce petition was issued  by  the  court.  Mr
    Whitwell made the point that there is no indication from this  document
    as to when the claimed self-employed earnings  of  �10,313  were  made;
    suggesting it could have been during the previous year,  after  6.4.14.
    We make clear that we do not take as a point against the appellant  the
    submission of Mr Whitwell that as other  documents  were  found  to  be
    suspect, such as the HMRC document at page 7 of the bundle which  bears
    a Santander logo, the other documents should be  regarded  as  likewise
    suspect. However, we were left far from satisfied as to credibility  of
    the appellant's explanation as to how he came into  possession  of  the
    HMRC document at page  27  for  the  2014/15  tax  year.  The  document
    purports to have been created  on  6.8.16,  long  after  the  appellant
    separated from his former spouse on any  of  the  various  versions  of
    events, either in 2013 or 2015. He initially said he obtained  this  in
    2015, which cannot be correct.  Then  he  said  he  couldn't  remember.
    Eventually, in response to  the  leading  questions  of  Mr  Ntochukwu,
    pointing him to the date shown on the document, he said he  got  it  in
    2016. He claimed he received it from Maria, a friend who was trying  to
    mediate between his former wife and himself. There  was  no  supporting
    evidence for this account which is not mentioned in  his  statement  or
    any other documentation. Further, there  were  no  invoices,  receipts,
    bank statements, or other evidence of the claimed employment.  We  note
    that whilst there are some relevant HMRC and other documents suggesting
    that the former wife was working in earlier years,  including  2010-11,
    the documentation  submitted  to  the  respondent  in  support  of  the
    application had significant gaps of years. Whilst it is  not  necessary
    for the appellant to demonstrate a continuity  of  self-employment,  or
    her being a qualified person over a period of five years, which was one
    of the errors of law found to have  infected  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision, the intermittent and somewhat unsatisfactory  nature  of  the
    evidence tends to undermine the reliability of the claim that he  knows
    that his former wife was working at the date of commencement of divorce
    proceedings.

20. We accept that it can be difficult to  obtain  necessary  documents  in
    relation to a former spouse's employment, particularly when the ongoing
    relationship may be less than cordial. However, we note that  not  only
    was the appellant's evidence to the effect that  he  did  not  ask  his
    former wife for documents to prove her employment, and did not  mention
    her employment in their 2015 phone call,  but  he  has  not  asked  the
    respondent for  assistance,  or  applied  to  the  court  for  an  Amos
    direction for production of documents, or for the  former  wife  to  be
    summoned to court as a witness.

21. Mr Ntochukwu's submission was that it was  safe  for  the  Tribunal  to
    assume that if the former wife was qualified  by  working  as  a  self-
    employed person  up  to  5.4.15,  which  he  submitted  was  adequately
    demonstrated by the HMRC document, she must have equally been qualified
    a short time later, on either 8.4.15, when the petition was received by
    the court, or even 22.4.15,  when  divorce  proceedings  were  formally
    issued. He suggested the difference was de minimis.  In  light  of  the
    inconsistent and unreliable evidence of the appellant as  to  his  last
    contact with his former wife and  the  unsatisfactory  explanation  for
    coming into possession of her HMRC record  in  2016,  as  well  as  the
    generally unsatisfactory nature of the evidence as a whole, we find  we
    cannot make the assumption or inference suggested by Mr  Ntochukwu.  We
    remain far from satisfied that the HMRC document is  reliable  evidence
    of the former spouse being a qualified period at any time in 2015,  and
    do not accept that it can properly be interpreted to cover the date  at
    which divorce  proceedings  were  commenced,  namely  22.4.15  or  even
    23.2.15, when he signed the petition.

22. Considering the evidence as a whole, we were far  from  satisfied  that
    the appellant does have any reliable knowledge as to whether his former
    wife was working at the date of commencement of divorce proceedings. On
    one of the versions of events, he has had only  one  telephone  contact
    with her since he left the matrimonial home in 2013, and in  that  call
    he did not ask her about her employment  at  all.  Some  parts  of  his
    evidence are so mutually inconsistent that we  are  satisfied  that  it
    cannot be true that he and his former spouse separated to go their  own
    ways in February 2015, as he told the tribunal. This, together with the
    other difficulties in the  evidence  highlighted  above,  substantially
    undermines the reliability  we  can  place  on  the  remainder  of  his
    evidence, including the claim that he 'knows' that she was  working  at
    the relevant time of the commencement of divorce proceedings.

23. In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out above, we  find  that
    the appellant has  failed  to  demonstrate  that  the  requirements  of
    regulation  10(5)  have  been  met.  Specifically,  we  find  that  the
    appellant has failed to demonstrate on  the  balance  of  probabilities
    that  his  former  spouse  was  a  qualified  person  at  the  date  of
    commencement of divorce proceedings. It follows that he is not entitled
    to a retained right of residence  and  in  consequence  the  claim  for
    recognition of a permanent right of residence must also fail.

Decision

24. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     We set aside the decision.

     We remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

We have considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.
Given the circumstances, we make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

We make no fee award.

Reasons: As the appeal has been dismissed there can be no fee award.
