For the Appellant: Mr E Tufan, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    No appearance

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  E  M  M  Smith  sitting  at  Nottingham
    Magistrates' Court on 1st July 2014)  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to  grant  him
    leave to remain as a Tier 4  Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an  anonymity  direction,
    and I do not consider that such  a  direction  is  required  for  these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant made his application for leave to remain on 7 March  2014.
    The application was refused on 8 April 2014.  He was awarded 30  points
    for his CAS, but 0 points for maintenance.  He  was  required  to  show
    living costs of �1,600 plus his outstanding course fees  as  stated  in
    his CAS.  He was therefore required to show that he was  in  possession
    of �1,600 for a consecutive 28  day  period.   The  bank  statement  of
    account number 6533-2 had not been accepted as evidence of funds as the
    document had been confirmed as false by the issuing authority.  He  had
    therefore used deception in the application, and it was  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules.  The application was also refused under
    paragraph 245ZX(a) and (d) of the Rules.

 3. The claimant asked for his appeal to be determined on the papers.   The
    Home Office bundle contained a document verification report.  Under the
    heading  of  "Detailed  verification  results"  Glynne  Moore  in   the
    "Document Centre Exception Department" was identified as the person who
    had carried out the verification of  the  proof  of  finances  document
    purportedly issued by the National Bank of Pakistan,  Sargodha  branch.
    The report gave the account name, the account  number  and  the  stated
    current balance.  Ms Moore's comments were as follows:

         FALSE - checks with issuing body confirm documents are  false  (see
         attachment).  Third party confirmation received on 28/3/14.

 4. On 21 May 2014  a  notice  was  issued  to  the  claimant  and  to  his
    solicitors stating that any written evidence and submissions had to  be
    received by 18 June 2014.  On 24 June 2014 there was  received  by  the
    Tribunal an undated covering  letter  from  the  claimant's  solicitors
    (Glynne Solicitors Limited)  together  with  three  enclosures.   These
    comprised written submissions from the claimant's solicitors, a  signed
    witness statement from the claimant with a statement of  truth,  and  a
    copy of a letter purportedly sent by an unidentified branch manager  of
    the Sarghoda Branch of the National Bank  of  Pakistan  dated  13  June
    2014.  In this letter, the unidentified branch manager  confirmed  that
    the contents of the earlier letter issued by the branch  on  behalf  of
    the claimant was genuine.  Furthermore,  they  had  not  received  "any
    verification" (sic) from UKBA/the British Embassy regarding  this  bank
    statement.

 5. In the covering letter, Glynne  Solicitors  said  that  they  would  be
    sending the original letter from the National Bank of Pakistan  in  due
    course, as it was in the post at the moment according to their  client.



 6. The court file contains what purports to be the original  bank  letter,
    but it was not received by the Tribunal until 14 July 2014,  which  was
    after the appeal was decided by the First-tier Tribunal.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 7. In his determination, Judge Smith observed that there was  "a  complete
    divergence between the parties."  On the one  hand,  the  Secretary  of
    State stated that on 28 March 2014 she had received  confirmation  from
    the issuing body that the bank statement was false.  On the other hand,
    the claimant had produced a letter from the National Bank  of  Pakistan
    dated 13 June 2014  stating  that  it  was  true.   The  judge  further
    observed that the Secretary of State had probably not seen  the  letter
    from the bank dated 13 June 2014.  But he could not exclude the  letter
    from the bank which  specifically  addressed  the  claim  made  by  the
    Secretary of State, and confirmed that the bank statement  was  genuine
    and that there were funds in the account; and by  inference  that  they
    had been in the account for a consecutive period of 28  days.   In  the
    letter of refusal, the Secretary of  State  did  not  take  issue  with
    regard to the fact that if the bank statement was  true,  the  claimant
    had satisfied the maintenance  requirements.   The  judge  reached  the
    following conclusion at paragraph 22:

         I find that the  [SSHD]  has  not  made  out  the  claim  that  the
         documents produced by the [claimant] are false.   It  may  well  be
         that  on  further  inspection  the  [SSHD's]  position  changes  or
         improves but on the evidence before me I cannot find  the  document
         is false.

 8. The judge allowed the appeal, but made no fee award as he was satisfied
    that the decision of the Secretary of State was reasonable at the  time
    that it was made.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 9. A member of the Specialist  Appeals  Team  applied  for  permission  to
    appeal, arguing it was obvious that little weight could be given  to  a
    letter asserting a document to be genuine in  circumstances  where  the
    letter purported to emanate from the same source as the false document,
    and where the Home Office had been given no opportunity to  investigate
    the genuineness of the new document.  As a result  of  this  procedural
    unfairness, the judge had fallen into material error of law.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

10. On 4 September 2014 Judge Verity granted permission to appeal  for  the
    following reasons:

         The judge should have  considered  the  source  of  both  documents
         coupled with the allegation that the first document was  false  and
         should not have accepted the statement  that  both  documents  were
         genuine without hearing evidence.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

11. At the hearing before me, there was no appearance by or  on  behalf  of
    the claimant.  I was satisfied from inspection of  the  file  that  the
    claimant and his solicitors had been informed of  the  time,  date  and
    place of the hearing, and that no good reason had been given for  their
    non-attendance.

12. I also noted that standard directions had been sent to the claimant and
    his solicitors giving the claimant the opportunity to file  a  Rule  24
    response; and informing the parties that they should  prepare  for  the
    forthcoming hearing on the basis that, if the Upper Tribunal decided to
    set aside the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  any  further
    evidence,  including  supplementary  oral  evidence,  that  the   Upper
    Tribunal might need to consider if it decided to re-make the  decision,
    could be so considered at that hearing.

13. Accordingly, I was satisfied that it was appropriate  to  proceed  with
    the hearing of the appeal in the claimant's absence.

14. I drew Mr Tufan's attention  to  the  fact  that  the  version  of  the
    document verification report in the Home Office bundle in my  file  did
    not have the  attachment  referred  to  in  the  document  verification
    report.  Mr Tufan produced the document verification report that was on
    his file, and I noted some differences.  Mr Tufan's  version  contained
    additional information that was not in my version, but his version also
    omitted or redacted other items of information.  For example, the  name
    of the person verifying the document had been redacted.  On  the  other
    hand,  the  person  concerned  gave  a  detailed  account  of   his/her
    experience in examining and checking  documents.   Mr  Tufan's  version
    also clarified with whom the verifier had made contact.   The  verifier
    had made contact with the Customer  Services  and  Government  Business
    Wing, Operations Group, at the National Bank of Pakistan Head Office in
    Karachi.

15. Mr Tufan's version also contained the  attachment  previously  referred
    to, which is an exchange of emails.  The verifier sent an email to  the
    National Bank of Pakistan Head Office asking them to verify the details
    of the claimant's account number 6533-2 purportedly held by him at  the
    Sargodha branch.  The email response was as follows:

         Dear  recipient,  on  the  basis  of  examination   of   the   bank
         statement/document  offered  by   your   office   by   the   branch
         concerned/branch  manager,  I  confirm  that   the   a/c   is   not
         genuine/fake.  Best regards [name redacted] Customer  Services  and
         Government  Business  Wing,  Operations  Group,  NBP  head  office,
         Karachi.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

16. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  vitiated  by  procedural
    unfairness for two reasons.  Firstly, as at the  date  of  the  hearing
    before Judge Smith, the claimant had not provided the  original  letter
    from the bank, although this had been promised.  What had been provided
    under cover of the letter from the claimant's  solicitors  was  only  a
    copy, and so it had inherently less probative value than  the  original
    letter, which presumptively would have been put in the post on 13  June
    2014, and so should have been available by the date of the hearing on 1
    July 2014.  Secondly, and more importantly, the copy letter of 13  June
    2014 emanated from precisely the same source as the earlier bank letter
    which had been verified as false: namely an unidentified manager of the
    Sargodha branch; and, as the judge appreciated, the Secretary of  State
    had not had the opportunity to respond to the evidence tendered by  the
    claimant, as the evidence had been served late.

17. For the above reasons, I find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is vitiated by a material error of law such that it should set
    aside and re-made.

The Re-making of the Decision

18. There were two items of evidence before me which were  not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The first is the document which  purports  to  be
    the original letter from the branch manager dated 13 June 2014, and the
    second is a copy of Mr Tufan's version  of  the  document  verification
    report, which has the email exchange which was missing  from  the  Home
    Office bundle that was before the First-tier Tribunal.

19. The concern that I explored with Mr Tufan was whether, if I  took  into
    account his version of the document verification  report  in  re-making
    the decision, the claimant would have an arguable  case  of  procedural
    unfairness.  Having reflected on the matter, I find  it  would  not  be
    procedurally unfair for me to take into account Mr Tufan's  version  of
    the document verification report.  There is no unfairness  because  the
    claimant and his solicitors were put on notice that they had to prepare
    for this hearing on the basis that, if the Upper  Tribunal  decided  to
    set aside the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  any  further
    evidence that the Upper Tribunal might need to consider if  it  decided
    to re-make the decision could be so considered  at  the  same  hearing.
    The claimant has declined the opportunity to comment on, or  give  oral
    evidence in rebuttal of, the additional evidence that was not available
    to the First-tier Tribunal.

20. I remind myself that the claimant was not bound to give  oral  evidence
    in support of his appeal.   The  burden  has  always  rested  with  the
    Secretary of State to prove the allegation of dishonesty and  deception
    through cogent evidence.

21. I find that the two versions of the document verification report that I
    have been shown are sufficient to discharge the burden of  proof.   The
    evidence reliably establishes that, upon enquiry  of  an  authoritative
    source, namely the National Bank of Pakistan Head  Office  in  Karachi,
    the claimant's asserted bank account number 6533/2 was confirmed to  be
    fake.  Although the claimant has  produced  the  original  bank  letter
    dated 13 June 2013, this has no more inherent reliability than did  the
    original bank letter.  For both of them purportedly come from the  same
    source, namely a branch manager who does not give his name.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the claimant's appeal against the refusal of  leave  to  remain
is dismissed.
