               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Read of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State is the appellant to  this  appeal  but  for  the
    sake of consistency I refer to  her  as  the  respondent  and  to  the
    original appellant as such.

2.    The  appellant  is  a  23  year  old  citizen  of  Pakistan.    In   a
    determination promulgated on 18 June 2014 in the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    Judge Brown allowed the appeal "on the basis that the decision appealed
    against was not made in accordance with the law".

3.   The appellant had appealed against the respondent's decision to  refuse
    his application for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a
    student.  He had had leave to remain on that basis until  25  May  2013
    and his application for further  leave,  the  subject  of  the  present
    appeal, was made within the period  of  that  leave.   The  appellant's
    application was refused because the  CAS  had  been  withdrawn  by  the
    sponsoring college.  The appellant's claim was that he was unaware that
    the CAS had been withdrawn at the time that he made his application and
    had received no notification from the college  until  12  August  2013.
    The judge allowed the appeal on the basis that the respondent  had  not
    followed her  own  well-known  policy  of  allowing  60  days  for  the
    appellant to have the opportunity to deal with the validity of the  CAS
    and/or to find a new college within that time.

4.   At the hearing before me, on the issue of  error  of  law,  Mr  Wilding
    acknowledged that the respondent had not granted 60  days  but  claimed
    that the judge had given no reasons for  his  decision  and  it  should
    therefore be set aside.

5.   For the appellant, Mr Read submitted that there  is  no  evidence  from
    either party as to why the college withdrew the CAS.   At  the  hearing
    before Judge Brown, the respondent chose not to  be  represented.   The
    same college, on 12 October 2013, had written to the appellant inviting
    him to re-enrol and, again, no reasons were given why the CAS had  been
    previously withdrawn.  Mr Wilding acknowledged that the college  letter
    had been in evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  but  it  was  not
    clear from the determination that that was the reason  why  the  appeal
    had been allowed.

6.   Having reviewed the First-tier Tribunal decision  and  the  submissions
    by both representatives, I am satisfied that there was a material error
    of law in the determination of Judge Brown  in  that  his  reasons  are
    manifestly unclear.  The determination must therefore be set aside.

7.   I cannot, however, find fault with his  ultimate  conclusion.   Neither
    party was able to provide any  cogent  reason  why  the  CAS  had  been
    withdrawn by the college.  Having regard to the letter dated 12  August
    2013 inviting him to re-enrol, the benefit of the doubt must  be  given
    to the appellant.  In those circumstances  it  seems  to  me  that  the
    respondent should have followed her own well-known policy  of  allowing
    the appellant 60 days to re-enrol or find a new college.  She failed to
    do so and, as such, her decision was not in accordance with the law.

Notice of Decision

8.   The First-tier Tribunal decision contained an error of  law  such  that
    the determination must be set aside.  I remake the decision by allowing
    the appeal on the basis that the respondent's decision of 7 August 2013
    was not in accordance with the law.   The  appellant's  application  is
    therefore awaiting a lawful decision.


    No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of ï¿½140  for  the  following  reason,  namely  that  on  the  evidence
available to the respondent it  should  not  have  been  necessary  for  the
appellant to have appealed.
