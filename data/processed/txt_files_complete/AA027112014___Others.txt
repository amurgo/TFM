Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Afzal, Immigration Advisory Service
For the Respondent:    Mr Irwin Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan, born 10 August 1960.   The
    other appellants are his wife and  minor  children  who  claim  as  his
    dependents.  The appellant entered the United  Kingdom  on  16  October
    2007.  He over stayed a visa requirement and then made  application  by
    reference to Article 3 ECHR.  That  application  was  rejected  and  he
    subsequently claimed asylum on 9 November 2011.  The basis of his claim
    was that he and a friend  had  a  land  dispute  with  a  third  party.
    Eventually that third party's brother was  killed  by  the  appellant's
    friend and this led to the appellant himself being  threatened  by  the
    third party.

 2. In considering the claim the respondent was of  the  opinion  that  the
    claim was not based upon a reason covered by the Refugee Convention and
    that  in  any  event  there  were   credibility   issues   arising   on
    inconsistencies in the appellants account.  The respondent rejected the
    claim and the appellant appealed that decision.

 3. The appellant's appeal came before Judge  of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    Murray sitting at Newport on 2 June 2014.  An oral hearing was held and
    the appellant was legally represented.  In her subsequent determination
    the judge dismissed  the  appellant's  claim  on  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and  human  rights  grounds.   For  reasons  stated  in  the
    determination the judge did not find the appellant credible in  respect
    of events that he claimed occurred in  his  home  country.   Indeed  at
    paragraph 32 of the determination the judge said:

         "In the circumstances therefore I found the appellant's account  to
         completely lack credibility.  I reject it in its entirety".


 4. For reasons set out in paragraph 34 of determination  the  judge  found
    that there were no compelling circumstances that would engage  a  stand
    alone Article 8 appeal.

 5. The appellant then sought leave to appeal.  The grounds allege error on
    the part of the judge in applying to high  a  standard  of  proof  when
    viewing the inconsistencies and in considering the  delay  in  claiming
    asylum.

 6. The second ground alleges error in the way the  judge  dealt  with  the
    "new" Immigration Rules.  It was alleged that  the  judge  should  have
    dealt with the matter by the step-by-step approach laid down in Razgar.
     The delay on the part of  the  respondent  in  considering  the  claim
    strengthened the appellant's roots in the United Kingdom.

 7. In granting leave to appeal another judge of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    gave the following as reasons:

         "1.  In a determination sent to the  appellants  on  18  June  2014
         Judge of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  Lucy  Murray  dismissed  their
         appeals on asylum and human rights grounds against the respondent's
         decision to remove them from the UK.


         2.   The grounds on which permission to  appeal  is  sought  submit
         that the judge erred by  considering  the  Article  8  claims  with
         reference to the Immigration Rules, whereas because the claims were
         made before 9 July 2012 they should have been considered separately
         from the Immigration Rules and with  reference  to  the  applicable
         jurisprudence.  This is arguably correct and it  is  arguable  that
         the judge  failed  adequately  to  consider  and  balance  all  the
         relevant evidence in relation to the issue of proportionality.


         3.   The grounds submit that the judge applied too high a  standard
         of proof  when  finding  that  the  first  appellant's  account  of
         circumstances  of  his  asylum  claim  was  not   credible.    This
         submission appears to have no merit.  The judge correctly  directed
         herself as to the burden and standard of proof and nothing  in  the
         determination  indicates  that  any  other  standard  was  in  fact
         applied.  The judge gave clear and cogent reasons for  disbelieving
         the  appellant.   This  submission  amounts  in  reality  only   to
         disagreement with her finding.  Nevertheless  permission  to  argue
         this ground is not refused".


 8. Hence the matter comes before me in the Upper Tribunal.

 9. Prior to the hearing the respondent submitted a Rule 24 response.  That
    letter  opposed  the  appellant's  appeal  submitting  that  the  judge
    directed herself appropriately.  Paragraph 3 of that letter sets out as
    follows:

            "The SSHD maintains that there was no error in regards  to  the
         standard of proof and in relation to human rights -  any  error  is
         not material because the claim is solely a private life claim which
         if now re-considered would result in the same outcome  due  to  the
         automatic  application  of  s.19  of  the  Immigration   Act   2014
         (inserting S.117(4) NIA 2002 Act) that  "little  weight  should  be
         given to private life that is established by a  person  at  a  time
         when the person's immigration status is precarious" - notably these
         appellants have only had 6 months lawful leave and 4ï¿½  years  leave
         unlawful".


10. Mr Afzal submitted by reason of the date of the application for  asylum
    the appeal should have been considered without  reference  to  the  new
    rules which came into force on 9 July 2012.  The judge  had  not  given
    any regard to transitional provisions.   In  this  case  the  old  rule
    should apply and there should have been Article 8 consideration of  the
    facts.

11. Mr Richards referred to the case of Haleemundeen v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 558 which contradicted the case
    of Edgehill v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 402.  The judge  had  clearly  dealt
    with S.55 considerations so far as the children are  concerned  and  he
    invited me to dismiss the application.

12. At this stage I said  I  needed  to  consider  the  submissions  and  I
    reserved my decision on whether or not there was a  material  error  of
    law contained in the determination.

13. After due consideration of the determination and the submissions made I
    have come to the conclusion that Judge Murray did make and error of law
    in reaching a conclusion that the "new rules" applied and  in  the  way
    she dealt with Art 8 ECHR.   The  authority  of  Edgehill  (please  see
    above) and the eventual Upper Tribunal decision  in  Haleemundeen  (the
    case having been referred back to the Upper Tribunal by  the  Court  of
    Appeal) reached a conclusion that cases such as this where the relevant
    date is before July 2012 required consideration other  than  under  the
    new rules.

14. In any event it could be argued that the position of this appellant  is
    not materially different when viewed under the old and then  under  the
    new rules.  However greater consideration should  have  been  given  to
    Article  8  than  as  set  out  in  paragraph  34  of  Judge   Murray's
    determination. The question of proportionality was not engaged.

15. In concluding that there was an  error  of  law,  I  also  reached  the
    conclusion that the error was material  in  that  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal could have been different  if  further  consideration  had  been
    undertaken.  The decision on Human Rights therefore  falls  to  be  set
    aside.

16. I consider that a degree of fact finding is necessary  with  regard  to
    the position of the appellant and  his  family.   Accordingly  in  this
    situation I conclude that the correct outcome is for this matter to  be
    remitted  back  to  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  in  line   with   Senior
    President's direction. The appeal is to be heard by a judge other  than
    Judge Murray.

17. Whilst the grounds seeking leave allege error in the decision on asylum
    and protection. That allegation was not  referred  to  at  the  hearing
    before me. The reasons for granting leave mention that this  point  had
    "no merit". I agree. The judge was  perfectly  entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusions that she did on credibility. She properly directed  herself
    and I find no error in that part of the determination.  Judge  Murray's
    decision is confirmed and her findings preserved on the asylum appeal.

18. The First-Tier  Tribunal  will  restrict  itself  to  consideration  of
    Article 8 only but will, of course, be mindful of the introduction  now
    of Sect 19 of The Immigration Act 2014.
