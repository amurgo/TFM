For the Appellant:                   Mr L Tarlow, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Counsel instructed by ATM Law Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal on Article  8
    grounds against the decision by the Secretary of  State  to  refuse  to
    grant him leave to remain as the partner of  a  British  national,  and
    against  the  Secretary  of  State's  concomitant  decision   to   make
    directions under Section 47 of the 2006 Act for his removal.  The First-
    tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction,  and  I  do  not
    consider the claimant requires anonymity for these proceedings  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national of  India,  who  first  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 8 October 2009 with  valid  entry  clearance  as  a  Tier  4
    General Student Migrant.  His leave to enter as a student ran until  30
    January 2012.  He was granted  an  extension  of  stay  in  the  United
    Kingdom until 11 January 2014 as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant.

 3. On 10 January 2014 he applied for leave to remain on the basis  of  his
    relationship  with  his  girlfriend,  Theresa  Mary  Byrne.   In  their
    covering letter, ATM Law Solicitors urged the  Secretary  of  State  to
    consider not only  the  appellant's  human  rights  but  those  of  his
    girlfriend when deciding the application.  They urged that their client
    had a very strong case under Article 8, and requested the Secretary  of
    State to consider  his  case  "under  her  discretion  and  exceptional
    circumstances outside the Immigration Rules."

 4. Miss Byrne made a statutory declaration in support of the  application.
    The appellant was her boyfriend and proposed fianc�.  She had known him
    for more than two years since October 2011, when  they  had  met  at  a
    party.  They started going out in November 2011.   The  appellant  went
    back to India in January 2012 for a short holiday, and she missed him a
    lot  while  he  was  away.   Their  relationship  had  developed,   and
    eventually in July 2012 they had moved in together  at  an  address  in
    Victoria Docks, and they continued to live together.  She had  been  in
    emotional  detriment  since  that  she  had  come  to  know  that   the
    appellant's leave to remain in the UK was about to expire, and he would
    have to leave the UK.  She would be greatly  hindered  if  he  returned
    back to India.

 5. On 6 March 2014 the Secretary of State gave her  reasons  for  refusing
    the application.  From the information provided, it  appeared  that  he
    had only been living with Miss Byrne since July 2012.  So  he  did  not
    fulfil the definition of a partner and could not meet the  requirements
    of  Section  R-LTRP.   His  application  was  therefore  refused  under
    paragraph D-LTRP.1.3 of the Rules.

 6.  It  had  been  carefully  considered  whether  EX.1  applied  to   his
    application.  It was acknowledged that he had a genuine and  subsisting
    relationship with his British partner.  But his  application  fell  for
    refusal under the eligibility requirements of  the  Rules  as  set  out
    earlier.  These were mandatory requirements applying to all  applicants
    regardless of whether the EX.1 criteria were met.  As he failed to meet
    those eligibility requirements, he could not benefit from the  criteria
    set out at EX.1.

 7. It had also been considered whether his application raised or contained
    any exceptional circumstances  which,  consistent  with  the  right  to
    respect for private and family life contained in Article 8 of the ECHR,
    might warrant consideration by the Secretary of State  of  a  grant  of
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom outside the requirements  of  the
    Rules.  It had been decided that it did not.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The claimant's appeal came before Judge D A  Pears  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross in the First-tier Tribunal on 20 November  2014.   Ms  Daykin  of
    Counsel appeared on behalf of the claimant.  In her skeleton  argument,
    she submitted that the sole reason for refusal was that at the date  of
    application the couple had not yet been living together for two  years,
    and therefore failed  to  meet  the  definition  of  a  partner  within
    Appendix FM.  But as they had been living  together  since  July  2012,
    they now satisfied that requirement.  So as of today the  claimant  met
    the Rules, and the sole issue raised for refusal fell away.  Therefore,
    she submitted, it could not be proportionate to remove the claimant  in
    these circumstances.  The Tribunal was requested to  allow  the  appeal
    under the Rules and/or under Article 8 ECHR.

 9. In his subsequent decision, the judge found that both the claimant  and
    Miss  Byrne  were  employed,  and  had  been  living  together   in   a
    relationship akin to marriage since July 2012.  At paragraph  [23],  he
    held there was a conflict between  the  terms  of  the  Rules  and  the
    evidence that he was entitled to take into account.  He  accepted  that
    in March 2014 there might not have been exceptional circumstances.  The
    judge continued in paragraph [24]:

         However it seems to me that this is exactly the sort of case  where
         there are arguably  good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
         outside the Rules because the circumstances are compelling and  not
         sufficiently recognised under them.  The [claimant] has  Article  8
         rights and so does his partner.  If the [claimant] applied  now  he
         would succeed under the Rules but he had to apply when  he  did  in
         order not to be in breach of the Immigration Rules.

10. The judge went on to find that it was not proportionate that  a  person
    who now met the Immigration Rules, and did so within  three  months  of
    the decision, should now be required to leave.  He also had  regard  to
    the terms of Section 117B and the fact that the claimant's actions  had
    not been contrary to immigration controls.  He spoke  English,  he  was
    not a burden on tax payers, he had integrated into UK society by having
    a UK partner, they were both financially independent and he  had  never
    been in the UK unlawfully.  So he allowed the appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

11. A member of the Specialist Appeals Team  settled  the  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The judge  had  failed  to
    explain why the case was exceptional.  There were no children involved.
     There had not been any consideration of the level  of  earnings,  only
    that the claimant and the sponsor were working.  The judge erred by not
    explaining why it would not be disproportionate  for  the  claimant  to
    return to India and make an application for a partner visa.  There  had
    not been a consideration of the claimant's ability to meet  the  rules,
    which might then make removal an unnecessary bureaucratic exercise.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

12. On 13 January  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  J  M  Holmes  granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         2.   Arguably it is not possible to  ascertain  from  the  decision
             precisely why the claimant failed to meet the requirements  of
             the Immigration Rules for a grant of  leave  to  remain  under
             either paragraph 276ADE or Appendix FM.  That being so  it  is
             arguable that the judge failed to place the Article  8  appeal
             into its  proper  context.   There  was  no  consideration  of
             whether the claimant would be able to seek  and  obtain  entry
             clearance from India as the sponsor's partner, and if not, why
             that would be likely to be refused.  There was  no  suggestion
             that the claimant would lack safety in the event of removal  -
             he would be able to visit his parents.  Arguably if he and the
             sponsor were serious about their relationship one might expect
             them to plan for her to visit them in  any  event,  which  she
             could do while the process of obtaining  entry  clearance  was
             undertaken.

         3.   The decision makes no  reference  to  the  Court  of  Appeal's
             decision in MM (Lebanon) [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  and  arguably
             fails to apply the guidance to be found therein.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

13. At the hearing before me, Counsel for the claimant defended the judge's
    decision.  He had set out the Gulshan test at  paragraph  [10]  of  his
    decision, and he recognised in paragraph [24] that he could only accord
    Article 8 relief to the  claimant  outside  the  Rules  if  there  were
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  them.   It
    was open to the judge to find in the claimant's favour on  this  issue.
    It might be a generous interpretation of Article  8,  but  it  was  not
    perverse.  It was clear that the judge had in mind  that  the  claimant
    met the financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  as  he  was  earning
    �16,000 per annum, and his partner was earning some �12,000 per  annum.
    So although he did not specifically mention Chikwamba, the judge had it
    in mind that it would be disproportionate to require  the  claimant  to
    return to India to apply for  entry  clearance,  as  he  was  bound  to
    succeed in such an application.

14. I found that an error of law was made out such that the decision should
    be set aside and re-made.  My reasons for so finding are set out below.

15. The representatives agreed that it was not necessary for me to hear any
    evidence for  the  purposes  of  re-making  the  decision.   Mr  Tarlow
    submitted that the claimant should not be accorded Article 8 relief, as
    he could now make an in-country  application  under  Appendix  FM.   So
    Chikwamba considerations did not arise.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

16. The judge failed to analyse properly where the claimant stood under the
    rules; and in consequence  he  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for
    according the claimant Article 8 relief outside the Rules.

17. In order for Miss Byrne to be treated as the appellant's  partner,  and
    not merely his girlfriend,  she  had  to  have  been  living  with  the
    claimant in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership  for
    at least two years prior to the date of application.  Accordingly,  not
    only was this eligibility requirement not met at the date of  decision,
    but it continued not to be met at the date of  the  hearing.   For  the
    date of the application remained the same. The claimant had not made  a
    fresh application after accruing two years' cohabitation.  Although  it
    was open to the claimant to rely on his change  of  circumstances  (the
    accrual of two years' cohabitation) as an additional ground of  appeal,
    he could only bring himself within the rules by withdrawing his  appeal
    and making a fresh application.

18. So the judge misdirected himself when he  said  there  was  a  conflict
    between the terms of the Rules and the evidence which he  was  entitled
    to take into account.   There  was  no  conflict.   The  definition  in
    GEN.1.2 enabled the claimant to make an  in-country  application  under
    Appendix FM once he had  accrued  two  years'  cohabitation  with  Miss
    Byrne. The same definition  prevented  him  for  making  a  meritorious
    application before he had accrued two years' cohabitation.

19. Although the judge purported to apply the Gulshan threshold  test,  his
    justification for finding that the test was satisfied does not stand up
    to scrutiny.  The proposition that the claimant has  Article  8  rights
    and so does his partner does not  in  any  way  advance  the  argument,
    especially as under the new rules the family and private life rights of
    applicants  and  affected  family  members  are  expressly  taken  into
    account.

20. The only other justification advanced by the  judge  was  that  if  the
    claimant applied now he would succeed under the Rules, but  he  had  to
    apply when he did in order not to  be  in  breach  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  However, as the judge acknowledged elsewhere, the claimant  did
    not satisfy any relevant Immigration Rule in order to be granted  leave
    to  remain;  and  there  were  not  any  exceptional  circumstances  in
    existence at the  date  of  application  (or  indeed  at  the  date  of
    decision), which justified Article 8 relief outside the Rules.  So  the
    fact that the claimant was now in  a  position  to  make  a  successful
    application under the Rules due to the time which had elapsed since  he
    had lodged an initially unmeritorious appeal from  a  wholly  justified
    refusal was hardly a compelling ground, still less  a  sufficient  one,
    for relieving the claimant of the obligation  to  make  an  application
    under the Rules like everyone else.

21. Although it is not presented as such, the reasoning in  paragraph  [28]
    is akin to a near miss argument.  The judge  found  that  the  claimant
    should be accorded Article 8 relief outside the Rules  because  he  was
    only three months short of the required two years  of  cohabitation  at
    the date of decision.  This justification for  according  the  claimant
    Article 8 relief outside the Rules on this ground is wholly contrary to
    legal principle, as illuminated by the Court of Appeal in  Miah  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 261 and by the Supreme Court in Patel [2013] UKSC 72.





The Remaking of the Decision

22. There was no challenge by the Secretary of State to the finding of  the
    First-tier Tribunal that Miss Byrne  now  meets  the  definition  of  a
    partner contained in GEN.1.2, apart from the fact that the claimant has
    not made a relevant application.

23. If a relevant application had been made, the fact that Miss  Byrne  met
    the definitional requirement in GEN.1.2 would not be  the  end  of  the
    matter, but merely a necessary starting point.

24. In order to qualify for leave to remain under Appendix FM, the claimant
    would need either to  show  that  he  met  the  financial  requirements
    contained in Appendix FM  and  Appendix  FM-SE;  or  that  he  met  the
    exemption criteria contained in EX.1.  It has not been  suggested  that
    there are insurmountable obstacles to the  couple  carrying  on  family
    life in India.  Reliance instead is placed on the proposition that  the
    claimant is likely  to  satisfy  the  financial  requirements,  as  the
    couple's combined income far exceeds the  annual  income  threshold  of
    �18,600.  There is no reason to suppose that this is not the case,  and
    therefore I accept that an application for leave to remain (or leave to
    enter) as the partner of Miss Byrne is likely to succeed.

25. But the claimant cannot succeed in this appeal under the Rules,  as  he
    has not made an application which complies  with  the  Rules.   On  the
    question of whether he should be accorded Article 8 relief outside  the
    Rules, I answer questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test in favour  of  the
    Secretary of State.  I find that the interference with  the  claimant's
    private or family life rights is minimal, as it is open to him to  make
    an in-country application under the Rules.  The refusal  decision  does
    not compel the claimant to return to India to make an  application  for
    entry clearance.  Provided he  makes  his  in-country  application  for
    leave to remain within 28 days of his appeal rights being deemed to  be
    exhausted, he will not be treated as an overstayer.  He will not have a
    right of appeal against the refusal of an in-country  application,  but
    there  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the   application   will   be
    unsuccessful.

26. As I answer questions 1 and 2 of the  Razgar  test  in  favour  of  the
    Secretary of State, the Article  8  claim  falls  away.  But,  for  the
    avoidance of doubt, I consider that the decision is  proportionate.  It
    is in the public interest that the Secretary of  State  should  be  the
    primary decision-maker on the question of whether  the  claimant  meets
    the financial requirements of the rules. Having regard to section  117B
    of the 2002 Act, it is in the claimant's favour that he speaks  English
    and is financially independent. But little weight should be given to  a
    private life established by a person at  a  time  when  his  status  is
    precarious. The claimant entered the UK for a temporary purpose and  he
    never had any legitimate expectation of being able to remain in the  UK
    as the partner of Miss Byrne unless and until he had  made  a  relevant
    application   which   was   fully    compliant    with    the    rules.






Notice of Decision

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
under Article 8  ECHR  contained  an  error  of  law,  and  accordingly  the
decision is set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is  substituted:  the
claimant's appeal on Article 8 grounds outside the rules is dismissed.


The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.
