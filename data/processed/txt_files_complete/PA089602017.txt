                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of China, born on  [  ]  1991.   He  made  a
    protection claim in the UK in September 2008 but  did  not  attend  for
    interview and was listed  as  an  absconder.   He  was  encountered  by
    immigration officials in August 2014 but after release did  not  comply
    with reporting conditions.  He advanced a claim  on  asylum  and  human
    rights grounds by letter from his solicitors dated 27 January 2015.

 2. The respondent refused that claim for reasons explained in  her  letter
    dated 30 August 2017.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly dismissed the appellant's appeal for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 24 October 2017.

 4. The appellant's 3 grounds of  appeal  to  the  UT  are  stated  in  his
    application for permission filed on 8 November 2017.

 5. Ground 1 arises from �7 of the decision, which says  that  after  being
    detained in 2014 the appellant absconded.  It is pointed  out  that  at
    �52-55 of his statement the appellant said he was given no further date
    on which to report.  The error alleged  is  failure  to  consider  that
    evidence.  Mr Winter submitted this was material,  in  context  of  the
    rest of the decision, and that it tied in with ground 3.

 6. Ground 3 arises from the conclusions stated by the judge at �22,  where
    he says that with the passage of time there is nothing to indicate that
    the Chinese authorities would be pursuing the appellant. This  is  said
    to overlook the appellant's evidence in his statement and  orally  that
    his friend had sight of an arrest warrant.  Mr  Winter  submitted  that
    release from detention in China did not necessarily mean the end of any
    interest, and that re-detention was not unusual.

 7. Ground 2 is that as the judge accepted that  individuals  might  be  at
    risk from snakeheads in China, and that  loan-sharks  are  violent  and
    ruthless, he should have allowed the appeal.  Mr Winter had nothing  to
    add to this ground.

 8. Mrs O'Brien submitted that ground 1 should be looked at in the  context
    that the appellant by his own admission previously absconded for 6 -  7
    years, and so further non-compliance was part of a pattern, even if  he
    eventually drew himself back to attention  by  making  an  application.
    The passage criticised was only a narration of the facts.  A judge  did
    not have to make  a  separate  finding  on  every  allegation  made  in
    evidence.  The appellant had been found  generally  not  credible,  for
    succinct but adequate reasons.  The conclusion of no  ongoing  interest
    was based on country guidance and was on an esto basis: "even were  his
    claims true  ...".   As  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  the  general
    findings, ground 3 was immaterial.

 9. Mr Winter in reply said that in his statement the appellant was  candid
    about his earlier absconding, and that even without ground 1, ground  3
    would be material, as  an  indication  of  ongoing  interest  from  the
    Chinese authorities.  It was accepted that specific findings  on  every
    point were not required, but the omissions in this case were material.

10. I reserved my decision.

11. Ground 1 attempts to make much of very little.  The appellant was aware
    he had no lawful status to remain in the UK. He did fail to report from
    2014 until he chose to make further representations.  The  decision  at
    �7 is a narration.  The conclusion at  �22  is  based  on  "failure  to
    pursue matters at the time", which is irrefutable, as  the  appropriate
    time was from arrival onwards.  It is to be presumed that the appellant
    would be notified of his  reporting  date.   At  best,  he  might  have
    obtained a finding that in absence of an interpreter  there  was  scope
    for misunderstanding.  This is immaterial.

12. Ground 3 criticises a finding made in  the  alternative.   The  written
    statement at �62, "I was aware from my friend that they  had  issued  a
    warrant for me and would arrest me if I  returned",  is  only  a  vague
    passing assertion, which did not call for separate resolution.

13. Ground 2 in essence says that the judge should  have  reversed  country
    guidance that internal relocation is  available  from  snakehead  risk.
    The judge found no such risk. Even if he had, there was no argument  or
    evidence which might have led him to revisit country guidance.

14. The decision is terse, but this was  a  perfunctory  and  long  delayed
    claim about which no more needed to be said.

15. The grounds and submissions for the appellant resolve into no more than
    insistence and disagreement on the facts.  They disclose no error on  a
    point of law, such as to call for the decision to be set aside.

16. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

17. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  Although  there  is  no  apparent
    need for one, the matter was not mentioned in the UT, so  anonymity  is
    preserved herein.
