Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr D Sills, instructed by Islington Law Centre
For the respondent:    Mr P Naith, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Modou Bojang, date of birth 1.2.79, is a citizen of  the
    Gambia.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hodgkinson, who dismissed his appeal against the decision of  the
    respondent,  dated  21.2.13,  to  refuse  his  application  for   entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as the  unmarried  partner  of  Mariama
    Cessay, a  person  granted  refugee  status  in  the  UK,  pursuant  to
    paragraph 352AA of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard  the  appeal
    on 17.4.14.

 3. Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds granted permission to appeal on 6.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 23.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Hodgkinson should be set aside.

 6. There is an unusual background to the appeal.  The  appellant  and  the
    sponsor had a long-standing romantic relationship in the Gambia, dating
    back to 1996. Had they had the opportunity, they  would  have  married.
    However, they were prevented from doing so by the  forced  marriage  of
    the sponsor with another man, Alieu. Asserting she was the victim of an
    abusive relationship, the sponsor fled to the UK in October 2010, where
    the First-tier Tribunal upheld her asylum appeal on the  basis  of  the
    risk of FGM to her two daughters born in the UK,  if  returned  to  the
    Gambia. The judge hearing the asylum appeal made no  findings  of  fact
    with regard to the strength of  the  sponsor's  relationship  with  the
    appellant, but accepted the claimed history of the relationship.

 7. The application the subject of this appeal was refused  because  at  no
    time has the appellant lived together with Ms Ceesay as  a  couple  and
    thus they do not meet the unmarried partner requirements  of  paragraph
    352AA. The Entry Clearance Manager review pointed out that there  is  a
    requirement that the couple have been living together in a relationship
    akin to marriage for two years or more and that such relationship  must
    have existed  before  the  refugee  left  the  country  of  his  former
    residence, but there was no evidence that the appellant was part of the
    sponsor's household prior to the departure  of  the  sponsor  from  the
    Gambia.

 8. As made, the application under the Rules was doomed to failure. At  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing, the  appellant's  representative  conceded
    that he could not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  352AA  or  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. In granting permission to  appeal
    on other grounds, Judge Reeds specificallyrefused permission to  appeal
    this part of the decision on the submitted  basis  that  352AA  was  an
    unduly restrictive implementation of EU Directive 2004/83/EC, an  issue
    not raised at the First-tier  Tribunal  appeal.  It  follows  that  the
    finding that the appellant  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, either in relation to 352AA  or  Appendix  FM,  must
    stand.

 9. Judge Hodgkinson proceeded to determine the appeal on the basis of  the
    uncontested and conceded  factual  history  of  the  relationship.  The
    appellant's case was that had they not been prevented from doing so  by
    the sponsor's forced  marriage,  they  would  have  married  and  lived
    together as a couple in the Gambia. At  �27  the  judge  accepted  this
    contention. Judge Hodgkinson noted that  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager
    conceded that the appellant and the sponsor enjoy  family  life  within
    the context of article 8 and that the  decision  interferes  with  such
    family life.

10. The judge adopted the Gulshan approach and found  that  there  were  at
    least arguable grounds for granted entry clearance  outside  the  Rules
    under  article  8  ECHR  on  the  basis  of  compelling   circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Rules which might render the  decision
    of the Secretary of State disproportionate. The judge thus proceeded to
    consider article 8 outside the Rules, following the Razgar five  steps.
    However, the judge found the decision was not disproportionate.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Reed found that  there  were  a
    number of relevant arguable issues relating to article 8,  however  the
    grounds at �20-22 have no arguable merit in the light of MM & Ors  R(on
    the application of) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  985,  where  the  Court  of
    Appeal found that it could not be said that the  financial  requirement
    threshold of Appendix FM was of itself disproportionate.

12. For the reasons set out herein, and aving  considered  the  grounds  of
    appeal,  the  determination  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal   and   the
    submissions  of  the  parties,  I  find  there  is  no  error  in   the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal such that  it  should  be  set
    aside.

13. I reject the submission that there is a flaw in the judge's finding  of
    an inconsistency in the evidence in �23-25 of the determination. It was
    common ground at the First-tier Tribunal that  the  sponsor  had  never
    worked in the UK, although she claimed that she  wanted  to  and  would
    have done so but for the emotional set  back  of  the  refusal  of  the
    appellant's entry clearance application. That was inconsistent with the
    evidence  that  in  December  2013  the  appellant  had  been   seeking
    employment at the sponsor's place of work. That made no sense  at  all.
    If the sponsor had never worked in the UK she could not  have  had  any
    place of work. The judge went on to find that as the sponsor  able  and
    willing to  work,  removing  a  potential  obstacle  to  seeking  entry
    clearance through an alternative immigration route. I do not accept the
    submission that the judge was engaging on speculation. It was  no  more
    speculation that the contention that if free to do so the  sponsor  and
    the appellant would marry and life together. It was relevant  that  the
    sponsor wanted to work, was evidently capable of work, and  would  have
    worked but for an "emotional setback" thus choosing not  to  work.  Her
    inconsistent evidence referred to above rather suggested that  she  may
    well have already worked, despite her assurances  to  the  contrary.  I
    find that the judge was entitled to take into account in the  balancing
    exercise to the limited extent that it was relevant that  there  was  a
    potential for the sponsor to work so as to enable an application  under
    the Immigration Rules.

14. I do not accept the contention in grounds 3 and 4 that  the  judge  was
    wrong to take into account at �34  that  the  sponsor  was  capable  of
    undertaking employment but, as found  by  the  judge,  in  reality  has
    chosen not to do so. The judge accepts that until  she  does  work  the
    appellant  will  be  unable  to  meet  the  financial  requirement   of
    alternative routes under the Immigration Rules. Mr Sills  submits  that
    the judge failed to take into account that neither under family reunion
    rules nor EX1 of Appendix FM, there is no financial  requirement.  That
    ignores the fact that the appellant does not and  never  could  qualify
    under the family reunion rules of 352AA. EX1 does not apply to  out  of
    country applicants under section EC-P of Appendix FM. Further,  article
    8 is not a shortcut to compliance with the Rules for  those  who  could
    never meet them. I reject the submission that the significance  of  the
    financial requirements is only of limited relevance when  they  can  be
    waived for in country applicants, or that the judge was wrong  to  note
    that the available third party support of �1,000  falls  far  short  of
    what would be the relevant financial threshold under Appendix  FM.  The
    judge was doing no more than considering all the relevant factors  when
    assessing the balance between the public  interest  in  protecting  the
    economic well-being of the UK through the  application  of  immigration
    control on the one hand and on the other the family life rights of  the
    appellant and the sponsor, which on the accepted  facts  of  this  case
    includes the right to develop their  intended  relationship  to  living
    together as partners. In that assessment it is only  correct  to  point
    out that the appellant is not an in-country applicant and there  is  no
    reason to consider his position as being akin to such. Failure to  meet
    the requirements  of  the  Rules  is  a  highly  relevant  factor  when
    considering the proportionality of the decision. Similarly, that  there
    may be an alternative route for entry is also relevant. That in certain
    in country situations of  an  existing  partnership  relationship  when
    there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  continuing  that  relationship
    outside the UK the financial requirements may be relaxed, is a far  cry
    from the circumstances of this case involving a couple who  have  never
    lived together as partners but only seek to do so in the future by  the
    appellant coming to settle in the UK. Mr  Sills  submissions  have  the
    appearance of a near miss argument, when case law has long  established
    that there is no such principle in immigration law.

15. I do not accept that  the  judge  has  taken  into  account  irrelevant
    factors at �36 of the determination. Whilst the judge accepts that they
    cannot for obvious reasons live together in the Gambia,  there  was  no
    evidence that they have explored alternative possibilities of  marrying
    in a third country. It is clear that the judge  is  merely  considering
    alternative routes of entry, including at �36 whether they could  marry
    in a third country and thus make a partners/spouse application, on  the
    basis of the findings that the sponsor was capable of  working  in  the
    UK.

16. Mr Sills' remaining arguments fail  to  take  account  of  the  limited
    nature of the family life between the appellant and the  sponsor.  This
    is not the case of a husband  and  wife  torn  apart  by  circumstances
    beyond their control where the mischief can be cured by family reunion.
    There never has been family union in this case at all. They have had  a
    long-standing relationship  but  they  have  never  lived  together  as
    partners or spouses. The nature of the family  life  in  this  case  is
    therefore rather limited to the desire and potential  to  cement  their
    long-standing romantic relationship by living together in  the  UK.  As
    the Rule 24 response of the Secretary of  State  pointed  out,  such  a
    relationship was factually well below that envisaged in the  Rules.  It
    is clear from �35 that the First-tier Tribunal took this  into  account
    when weighing the proportionality balance.

17. Taking an overall view of  the  evidence,  the  determination  and  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal, I find that the judge  has  fairly
    taken into account all relevant factors in a careful assessment of  the
    proportionality of the decision. Many of the findings and the  decision
    to consider the matter under article 8 ECHR outside the  Rules  are  in
    the appellant's favour. Much of Mr Sills' argument  is  a  disagreement
    with the findings of the judge and a  more  philosophical  disagreement
    with the Immigration Rules themselves. I find  that  there  is  nothing
    within the determination that suggests the  decision  was  perverse  or
    that the conclusions were ones that the judge was not entitled to reach
    on the evidence and agreed facts. I find it difficult to conceive  that
    any other judge could have reached a different conclusion on the  facts
    of this case. In any event, I find that the judge has given a fair  and
    balanced assessment to the appellant's case, both under the Immigration
    Rules and outside the Rules on the basis of family life  under  article
    8, to the limited extent that there is family life in the unusual facts
    of this case it has been fully taken into account.

Conclusion & Decision

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
