Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Background

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Palestine, who was born  on  19th  March,
    1983.  He was first admitted to the United Kingdom on 26th  May,  1988,
    for six months as a visitor with his siblings and mother, travelling on
    his mother's passport.  He was last admitted to the United  Kingdom  on
    4th February 1992, together with his mother and  three  siblings  until
    25th June 1994 in line with is father's leave to remain.  He  has  been
    in the United Kingdom since he was 8 years of age.

2.    His  immigration  history  is  lengthy.  The  appellant's  father  was
    admitted to the United Kingdom in 1987.  His application for  leave  to
    remain as a student and an application for asylum were refused on  22nd
    June, 1990, when he was granted leave to remain  exceptionally  outside
    the Immigration Rules until 22nd June,  1991.    He  was  then  granted
    further leave to remain until  22nd  June,  1994.   The  appellant  was
    granted periods of leave to remain in line with his father  until  22nd
    June, 1997, and on 12th January, 1998, he was granted indefinite  leave
    to remain in line. He subsequently applied for British nationality  but
    that application was refused for reasons which will become apparent.

Previous Criminal Convictions

3.   On  5th  February,  2003,  the  appellant  was  sentenced  by  Hyndburn
    Magistrates Court for resisting or obstructing a police  constable  and
    using a vehicle with no test  certificate  and  ordered  to  pay  fines
    totalling �100 and costs of �55.

4.   On 1st May of that year he was sentenced by the  same  magistrates  for
    possessing Class A controlled drugs and was ordered to pay  a  fine  of
    �100 and costs of �100.

5.   On 24th March, 2004, he was sentenced at the  same  magistrate's  court
    of possession of Class B controlled drugs and ordered to pay a fine  of
    �100 and costs of �65.

6.   On 1st May that year at  Burnley  Crown  Court,  he  was  convicted  of
    possessing Class A controlled drugs with intent to supply. The drugs in
    question were crack and heroin.

7.   On 16th September, 2004, he was sentenced to four  years'  imprisonment
    on each of those offences to run concurrently.  He did not  appeal  his
    sentence or conviction. His earlier application for British citizenship
    was subsequently refused.

Liability to Deportation

8.   In the light of his conviction, he was notified  of  his  liability  to
    deportation on 26th April, 2006.  On 11th May, 2007, a decision to make
    a deportation order was served on him and he was advised  that  he  was
    liable  for  deportation  to  Jordan,  because  at  that  time  he  was
    identified as a Jordanian  national,  given  the  documentary  evidence
    provided.

First Deportation Appeal

9.   On 17th May, 2007, he lodged an appeal against  deportation  which  was
    heard on 5th September that year and his appeal was allowed on  Article
    8 grounds. As a result of this, on 28th January, 2008,  the  respondent
    sent a warning letter to him advising him  that  were  he  to  come  to
    adverse notice in  the  future  she  would  be  obligated  to  consider
    deportation again.

Subsequent Criminal Convictions

10.  On 17th December, 2008, he  was  convicted  by  Blackburn,  Darwin  and
    Ribble Valley Magistrates of possessing  a  Class  C  controlled  drug,
    cannabis, and sentenced to a conditional discharge  for  twelve  months
    and ordered to pay costs of 360.

11.  On 19th  December  that  year  he  was  again  convicted  by  the  same
    magistrates for breach of conditional discharge and given  a  community
    order with a curfew requirement and four weeks electronic tagging.   On
    the same date he was also sentenced by Hyndburn Magistrates  Court  for
    possessing a Class A controlled drug, cocaine, and  given  a  community
    order with a four week curfew requirement and costs of �60.

12.  On 20th October, 2010, at Burnley  Crown  Court  he  was  convicted  of
    three counts of possession of a Class A controlled drug with intent  to
    supply heroin and crack cocaine and one count  of  being  concerned  in
    producing a Class A drug, namely crack, and sentenced on 19th  November
    that year to six  years'  imprisonment  on  each  count  to  be  served
    concurrently.  He did not appeal either the conviction or sentence.

Liability to Deportation

13.  On 17th January, 2011, the respondent again notified the  appellant  of
    his liability for deportation and  he  responded  indicating  that  his
    deportation would result in a breach of his human rights.

14.  On 13th September, 2012, he was convicted at  Preston  Crown  Court  of
    two counts  of  concealing,  disguising,  converting  or  transferring,
    remove criminal property, and sentenced on 14th  January,  2013  to  21
    months'  imprisonment  consecutive  to  the  sentence  he  was  already
    serving.

15.  On 5th June, 2013 at Preston Crown Court a confiscation order was  made
    requiring him to pay the sum of �37,147. 06 within six  months  of  the
    order  being  made.   He  was  liable  for  a  further  twelve  months'
    imprisonment  consecutive  in  the  event  of  failure   to   pay   the
    confiscation order.

Second Deportation Appeal

16.  The appellant appealed against the decision of the respondent taken  on
    11th October, 2013, to make a deportation order by  virtue  of  Section
    32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 and to refuse the appellant's  Article
    8 claim under paragraph 398 of  Statement  of  Changes  in  Immigration
    Rules HC 395 as amended.  The appellant's appeal was heard at  Bradford
    Magistrates Court by a panel  of  the  Tribunal  comprising  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Birkby and Mr G H Getlevog,  a  non-legal  member.   The
    panel  concluded  that  removal  of  the   appellant   would   not   be
    disproportionate and dismissed the appellant's appeal.

The challenge to the First Tier Tribunal's decision

17.   Grounds  of  appeal  were  subsequently  submitted,  challenging   the
    decision of the panel under three separate heads.   The first challenge
    asserted that the panel failed to give proper reasons  in  relation  to
    its assessment of his reoffending.  The second challenge suggested that
    the panel had failed to consider whether it was even possible to return
    the appellant to Palestine, or whether he would be at risk of  harm  on
    return and the last challenge suggested that the panel failed  to  have
    sufficient regard to case law and in particular to Ogundimu (Article  8
    new Rules) (Nigeria) [2013] UKUT 00060 (IAC), given that the  appellant
    had been in the United Kingdom since the age of 8.

18.  Miss Rawlinson addressed me in respect of the  second  challenge  only,
    possibly because in  granting  permission,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blandy suggested that the first and second grounds were  not  arguable.
    She suggested that the panel had  erred  by  failing  to  consider  the
    objective evidence as to the risk the appellant would be  subjected  to
    on his return to Palestine. given that he would have to pass through an
    Israeli checkpoint and the checkpoints into Palestine are controlled by
    the Israeli occupying forces.  At best,  she  submitted,  he  would  be
    turned away by the Israelis and at worst he would be at  risk  of  harm
    because of his history and the history of his uncle, who was killed  by
    the Israeli forces in 1989  during  militia  insurgency.   She  further
    submitted, that the length of time the appellant  has  been  away  from
    Palestine in itself, would cause him to be at risk of  enquiry  by  the
    Israeli authorities, who would want to know why  he  had  been  out  of
    Palestine for twenty years.

My consideration of the grounds of appeal

19.   Dealing  first  with  the  first  of  the  three  challenges  in   the
    appellant's application, it  is  suggested  that  the  panel  erred  by
    suggesting that they were not satisfied that they  could  rely  on  the
    NOMS report, bearing in mind the appellant's history.   It is suggested
    that the panel erred by failing to attach weight to the  NOMS  document
    or, in the terminative, by failing to grant an adjournment so that  the
    panel could  have further information regarding the risk.  I will  deal
    with that first.

20.  At paragraphs 69, 70 and 71 the panel considered the question  of  risk
    of reoffending at some length.  They noted that the appellant  had  not
    denied his history of escalating drug offending and being involved  and
    associated offences. They noted the remarks of the sentencing judge  at
    the hearing on 19th November, 2010, described him as being

          "a professional and commercial drug dealer  in  heroin  and  crack
    cocaine".

     They noted that his offending was not simply related to possession  and
    supply of drugs, but also included the manufacture  of  illegal  drugs.
    They noted that he had previously been the  subject  of  a  deportation
    order, against which he had  successfully  appealed  and  that  he  was
    clearly warned that any further  offending  would  lead  to  a  further
    deportation order.

21.  The assessment  made  on  8th  August,  2013,  was  risk  serious  harm
    described as being "low risk." There was no OASys Report available  and
    the NOMS report was therefore asked to provide what  information  could
    be supplied with regard to "risk of  serious  harm".  The  report,  the
    panel noted, said "Mr Jaber is serving a prison sentence in relation to
    drugs supply. He has seven previous convictions and they demonstrate  a
    pattern in relation to drugs."

22.  Section 3 of the report, which dealt with  the  risk  of  reconviction,
    the source of the information and additional comments, is stated to  be
    from OASys Report. The risk of reconviction  predictor  indicated  that
    the OGRS (Offender Group Reconviction Scale) states that the  appellant
    is OVP. In other words, his violent predictor is shown as L, presumably
    low, for one year and L for two years.  His  OGP  (General  reoffending
    Predicator) is shown as medium for one year and medium for  two  years.
    His OGRS  (Offender  Group  Reconviction  Scale)  which  estimates  the
    possibility that offenders with a given history of offending  would  be
    reconvicted for any recordable offence within two  years  of  sentence,
    which is a predictor of reoffending within one and  two  years,  showed
    37% for one year and 54% for another year. The Panel  of  the  Tribunal
    noted that there were only limited explanations given  as  to  how  the
    figures had been arrived at.

23.  The Tribunal went on to consider the assertions made by  the  appellant
    that he would not reoffend, that he had effectively learned his  lesson
    and wished to lead a normal life as soon  as  he  was  released.   They
    noted the assertions made by family members  who  indicated  that  they
    would support him.  They also took account of the various  courses  and
    education opportunities that  the  appellant  had  taken  advantage  of
    during his recent period in custody and bearing in  mind  his  history,
    concluded that they could not simply rely on the NOMS  document.   They
    noted that his history was one of escalating serious  offending,  which
    they quite properly pointed out had an incalculable effect on the lives
    of others which had no doubt been blighted by his drug offending.  They
    noted the many opportunities the appellant had to mend his ways and the
    promises he had made in the past but his  offending  simply  escalated.
    They found that the offending was so serious that they could take  into
    account the deterrent effect when it comes not only to considering  the
    punishment he has  already  been  receiving,  but  also  when  deciding
    whether deportation is appropriate  and  indeed  the  public  interest.
    Indeed, in paragraph 74 of their determination, the panel refer to his:

         "...horrendous  history  of  breaking  the  law  and  breaking  his
    commitments with regard to non-offending."


    I am satisfied, given this appellant's appalling history that the first
    ground of appeal fails to identify any error on the part of the panel.

24.   The  third  ground  suggested  that  the  panel  had  failed  to  have
    sufficient regard to case law, bearing in mind that the  appellant  had
    been in the United Kingdom since he was 8 years of age.

25.  However, a careful reading of the determinations demonstrates that  the
    panel did into account the length of time the appellant  had  spent  in
    the United Kingdom and the fact that he arrived as an 8 year old  child
    (see paragraph 72 of determination).   They noted at paragraphs 74 that
    his family had not been in a position to prevent him from  reoffending.
    They further noted that the appellant had not  been  in  Palestine  for
    some 22 years, but concluded that his offending was simply too  serious
    to outweigh his claims to remain in the United Kingdom because  of  his
    history.  His length of time in the United Kingdom and the fact that he
    has been here since he was a boy was, in their judgment, outweighed  by
    the public interest in keeping society safe from a  perennial  offender
    who they believed in all  likelihood  would  be  a  serious  threat  to
    individuals living in the United Kingdom, were  he  to  be  allowed  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on his release from prison.

26.  Those were findings which, given  the  appellant's  appalling  history,
    were open to the panel to make.

27.  The last challenge seems to suggest that there  was  a  requirement  on
    the panel to consider the means  by  which  the  appellant  was  to  be
    returned to his own country,  but  there  is  no  such  requirement  in
    deportation appeals.  How the Secretary of State achieves her objective
    is a matter entirely for her. The appellant has not  raised  an  asylum
    claim. He had not raised an Article 3  claim  and  given  that  he  was
    represented throughout, if there was a serious possibility that on  his
    return he would be at risk, then I have no  doubt  whatsoever  that  it
    would have been raised as an asylum claim or an Article 3 claim.

Conclusion9

28.  I find that there are no errs of law in  this  determination,  which  I
    uphold.
