For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of [AA], a citizen  of  Bangladesh  born  4  January
    1986, against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  of  27  October
    2018, dismissing his appeal, itself brought against the refusal of  his
    asylum and human rights claims of 13 September 2018.

 2. The  immigration  history  supplied  by  the  Respondent  is  that  the
    Appellant arrived in the UK on 10 February  2011,  with  student  leave
    until June 2012. An application for further leave was refused due to no
    fee being received, and a further application was  received  in  August
    2012 but refused. He came to the attention of  the  authorities  as  an
    overstayer in  September  2016,  that  application  being  refused  and
    certified as clearly unfounded. He claimed asylum on 14 September 2016.



 3. His asylum claim was based on his claim to have been politically active
    in Bangladesh  with  the  Chatra  Dal  (student)  branch  of  the  BNP.
    Furthermore his family had rejected him because of  a  relationship  he
    had in this country with a lady known as [J]. His  human  rights  claim
    was based on his relationship with [GR], to whom he had become  engaged
    to in April 2017 and married (via  an  Islamic  ceremony)  in  February
    2018; she had three sons from a previous relationship.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal heard oral evidence, and made its  findings  of
    fact. It considered that the Appellant's asylum claim was brought  very
    late and only after the Appellant had had an extended  engagement  with
    the immigration processes of the  UK,  and  had  provided  untranslated
    documents which could be afforded  no  evidential  weight.  There  were
    discrepancies  in  his  account  of  how  his  family  learned  of  his
    relationship with [J].

 5. As to his family life claim, he could not satisfy the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules given that the parties had not registered a civil
    marriage and had not cohabited  for  two  years.  There  were  no  very
    significant obstacles to the Appellant's integration back in Bangladesh
    and  his  immigration  history  (including  working  illegally  as   an
    overstayer) was appalling, such as to reinforce the public interest  in
    refusing his claim. He and his wife would  have  been  aware  that  his
    status was precarious when they formed  their  relationship.  He  spoke
    fluent English and had shown resourcefulness when working illegally  in
    the UK. There would be no unjustifiably harsh consequences were  he  to
    be removed. Ms [R] would have  the  support  of  her  mother  with  the
    children if the Appellant had to leave the country.

 6. Of the Appellant's relationship with the children, the Tribunal  stated
    "I accept that the Appellant has, to some degree, a  relationship  with
    the step children and that he assists in  taking  them  to  school  and
    collecting  them,  although  I  am  not  entirely  convinced  that  his
    involvement with the children is as involved as he claims" having given
    an account of being away in town until late at night on  both  days  of
    the previous weekend.

 7. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law
    in failing to indicate in the passage I have  just  cited  whether  the
    Appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship with  the  children
    such as to engage section 117B(6) of the  Nationality  Immigration  and
    Asylum  Act  2002,  and  in  failing  to  have   regard   to   evidence
    demonstrating the Appellant did play a real life in the boys'  life  as
    shown by a letter from Dr Echebarrieta stating that the  Appellant  was
    in "a stable relationship and ... his presence is of great  benefit  to
    [G] and her children, and their marriage contributed clearly  to  their
    stability", and to a letter from the school.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on 8 February 2019 on the  basis  that
    no findings had been made as to whether Ms [R]'s boys  were  qualifying
    children and  whether  the  Appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with them.

 9. Before me Mr Mustakim pointed to evidence (set out in my reasons below)
    that  in  his  submission  demanded  attention  as  relevant   to   the
    proportionality of interfering with this family's Article 8 rights.  Mr
    Whitwell pointed to para 111 of the refusal letter which had stated  it
    was not established that the Appellant  had  developed  a  relationship
    such as to be unjustifiably harsh. It was  in  this  context  that  the
    Judge's findings  had  to  be  considered.  The  school  letter  simply
    rehearsed information supplied by the boys' mother;  and  the  doctor's
    letter was relatively brief.

  Decision and reasons

10. Section 117B(6) of NIAA 2002 states:

         "117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in  all
         cases

         ...

         (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
         the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

11. As stated by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ  705  �49,  Ex.1
    "establishes as a starting point that leave should  be  granted  unless
    there are powerful reasons to the contrary"; albeit that �73:  "It  may
    be reasonable to require the child to leave where there are good cogent
    reasons, even if they are not compelling."

12. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal did not  conduct  the  enquiry
    mandated  by  section  117B(6)  because  in  its  estimation   it   was
    unnecessary to do so. However, it seems to me  that  there  was  rather
    more evidence to evaluate  than  that  to  which  it  referred  in  its
    conclusions. The only aspect of the evidence  that  received  attention
    was the Appellant's evidence that he had stayed out late  the  previous
    weekend. That needed to be assessed in the context of multiple  strands
    of evidence that demanded attention:

      a) The letter from the Appellant  which  he  adopted  as  his  witness
         statement stated "[S] the eldest child has lots  of  problems  with
         his behaviour [G] struggles with this  but  I  feel  as  a  man  in
         guiding him in the best way I can he is getting better".

      b) The letter from his partner [GR] stated that "[A] was very  patient
         and understanding to myself and  my  children.  He  was  absolutely
         amazing. In May we decided it would be nice for  [A]  to  move  in.
         Since then we have all been living together  as  a  family  I  have
         found him to be a great support ... he is  very  supportive  to  my
         eldest son in these  difficult  times  and  also  offers  emotional
         support to me and the other  two  children".  The  difficulties  of
         which she spoke included emotional outbursts from the eldest son so
         extreme as to require police intervention.

      c) Dr Echebarrieta in his letter had stated that the relationship  and
         "had a significant positive effect on [G] and her  3  children,  as
         they have a father figure they can relate to" (there  is  also  the
         letter from the school, which can no  doubt  be  read  as  relating
         information garnered from the parents, but which might also take on
         a different light when read in the overall context).

13. This represents evidence from multiple sources which a  decision  maker
    who had appropriate regard to it might consider to  have  both  cogency
    and depth. Unfortunately the Judge failed to engage with this  material
    before coming to his somewhat equivocal finding as to  the  Appellant's
    lack of genuine parental responsibility for his  partner's  sons.  This
    represents an inadequacy of reasoning, or a failure to take account  of
    material evidence, of a scale that undermines  the  lawfulness  of  the
    decision.

14. There is no tenable challenge to the findings on the asylum  ground  of
    appeal and those should stand when any further assessment of the appeal
    takes place.

15. In the circumstances there is no alternative than to remit  the  appeal
    for hearing afresh. In so  doing,  I  draw  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    attention to some features of the appeal.

      a) The Appellant cannot succeed under the Immigration  Rules,  because
         at the date of application he had not cohabited for a  sufficiently
         long period to satisfy the GEN requirements of Appendix FM for  the
         "partner" definition;

      b) Accordingly he has to demonstrate a "compelling" claim;

      c) Whilst he cannot meet the precise terms of the mainstream  Appendix
         FM Rules themselves, as noted by Lord Carnwath in the Supreme Court
         in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 at [55], "the balance drawn  by  the  rules
         may be relevant to the consideration of proportionality";

      d) From September 2017, GEN.3.2 was added to  the  Rules,  essentially
         stating that  "where an application for entry clearance or leave to
         enter or remain made under this Appendix,  or  an  application  for
         leave to remain which has  otherwise  been  considered  under  this
         Appendix, does not otherwise meet the requirements of this Appendix
         or Part 9 of the Rules ...  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
         consequences";

      e) In the event that the First-tier Tribunal finds the Appellant  does
         play sufficient role in his partner's sons' upbringing  to  enliven
         consideration under section 117B(6), as stated by Elias  LJ  in  MA
         (Pakistan) [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  �49,  Ex.1   "establishes  as  a
         starting point that  leave  should  be  granted  unless  there  are
         powerful reasons to the contrary"; albeit  that  �73:  "It  may  be
         reasonable to require the child  to  leave  where  there  are  good
         cogent reasons, even if they are not compelling";

      f) There has been a recent re-statement of the law regarding the  best
         interests of the children in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53. In so far
         as this makes clear that the sins of the parents cannot be  visited
         on children for whom they have parental  responsibility,  doubtless
         the judgment resonates here. However,  the  comments  made  therein
         regarding the need  for  "reasonableness"  not  "to  be  considered
         otherwise than in  the  real  world  in  which  the  children  find
         themselves" must in this appeal be read subject  to  the  claim  of
         British citizen children to live in their  country  of  nationality
         and to the fact that  their  mother  is  also  a  British  citizen,
         herself entitled to live permanently in the UK.

    Decision:

      1) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error
         of law.

      2) The appeal is remitted for hearing  afresh  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal at Hatton Cross: to be heard by  any  Judge  except  Judge
         Greasley.
