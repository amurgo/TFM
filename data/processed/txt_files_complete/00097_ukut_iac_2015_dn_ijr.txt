JUDGE PETER lane: This is an application by Mr DN for a judicial  review  of
 the decision of the respondent taken on 23 October 2013 not to  treat  his
 submissions of 22 February 2010 as a fresh asylum or human  rights  claim.
 Permission was granted by the Upper Tribunal on 15 August  2014  following
 an oral hearing.


Immigration history

2.   The immigration history of the applicant is set  out  in  the  detailed
    grounds of defence.  It is essentially as follows.  In  June  2006  the
    applicant arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  and  claimed  asylum.   His
    application was refused on 10 July 2006 and  he  received  a  right  of
    appeal under what is known as the Fast  Track  Procedure.   Under  that
    procedure his appeal was heard by an Immigration Judge,  but  dismissed
    on 21 July 2006.  By 27 July  2006  the  applicant  had  become  appeal
    rights exhausted.

3.   A previous judicial review brought in November 2006 was refused on  the
    papers.  In April 2007 permission was refused at a permission  hearing.
    In June 2007 an allegation of torture  was  sent  to  the  respondent's
    caseworkers and later in that month  the  applicant  lodged  a  further
    application for judicial review.  On 15  November  2007  permission  to
    apply for judicial review was refused on the papers.  On 15 April 2008,
    the applicant not having been removed in the meantime,  the  respondent
    was notified that the applicant had applied to the  European  Court  of
    Human Rights pursuant to rule 29 of their Procedure  Rules,  so  as  to
    prevent his removal from the United Kingdom.  On 22 February  2010  the
    applicant made further submissions, to which I have made reference.

4.    Delays  then  occurred;  it  is  possible  in  part  because  of   the
    applicant's failure to report. In any event, on 23  October  2013,  the
    applicant  received  the  decision  which  is  the  subject  of   these
    proceedings.

Determination of the applicant's appeal

5.   The determination of the Immigration Judge who  heard  the  applicant's
    appeal in July 2006 needs to be considered in some detail.  As  I  have
    indicated, it was an  appeal  that  was  heard  under  the  Fast  Track
    Procedure Rules.  An application was made to adjourn which was refused.
     The judge, however, does not record any application being made for the
    case to be taken out of the Fast Track.

6.   In refusing the application to adjourn, the judge  considered  that  he
    had all the evidence that was needed in fairness in order  for  him  to
    make a determination.  The applicant pointed out to the  judge  various
    scars on his body, which he  said  had  been  caused  as  a  result  of
    conflict in Sri Lanka.  He did not, however, understandably, point  out
    any scar to his penis; of which more later.

7.   The applicant told the judge that he had been born and  brought  up  in
    Vavuniya.  In 1998 or 2000 he had been arrested for the first  time  in
    that area.  He was released with the  help  of  the  principal  of  his
    school.  He was then arrested a second time in 2002, again in Vavuniya,
    by members of the EPRLF and detained with other people for fifteen days
    at an EPRLF camp.  There he was identified by a masked man as  an  LTTE
    member, beaten and subjected to what he described as  smoke  treatment.
    However, the applicant refused to admit that he was  a  member  of  the
    LTTE.  He became weak as a result of his experiences and was  taken  to
    hospital but discharged after two days.

8.   He then carried on with his studies to GCE A  level  standard  but  did
    not go on to university.  He remained in Kilinochchi where he  obtained
    employment in a hotel.  He then became a full member of the  LTTE,  who
    sent him for  military  training.   In  this  capacity,  amongst  other
    things, he passed on information about  guests  at  the  hotel  to  his
    superior.  He was later  required  to  carry  out  work  for  the  LTTE
    investigation group.  This sent him to Vavuniya in September 2005, when
    there was a bomb blast.  The applicant was arrested during a  resulting
    round-up.  He could not recall which day in September it was.   He  was
    found in possession of an LTTE identification  tag.   First  he  denied
    being a member of the LTTE.  He was hung upside down, his head in a bag
    of chilli flakes, beaten on the legs with canes; and  as  a  result  of
    this he confessed that he was a member of the  LTTE  and  identified  a
    number of people as members of that organisation.  He was:

         "released and allowed to escape" one day in early January 2006 as a
         result of a bribe paid by his father.  He went to Vanni  but  could
         not remain there as  he  had  identified  LTTE  members  who  lived
         there."

9.   The applicant returned to his job  at  the  hotel  in  Kilinochchi  and
    lived together with the LTTE until May of 2006. Then, according to  his
    account, as given to the judge:

         "he came under suspicion by the LTTE investigation unit who started
         surveillance on him.  He feared that they would find  out  that  he
         worked against them.  His father arranged for an agent to take  the
         appellant to a safe country which he learnt on arrival was the UK."

10.  The judge made adverse credibility findings, beginning at paragraph  31
    of the determination.  Having  described  the  applicant's  account  as
    "superficially  consistent"  the  judge  nevertheless  held   that   it
    contained:

         "glaring discrepancies and implausible claims such that I am unable
         to accept any material  self-serving  assertion  by  the  appellant
         which his not supported by other evidence."

11.  The matters which concerned the judge were set  out  at  paragraph  32.
    There were problems regarding dates and even years of the arrest  which
    led  to  the  applicant's  first  period  of  detention.   There   were
    discrepancies in his  accounts  of  the  occasions  when  he  had  been
    arrested.  There was an inconsistency regarding the place to  which  he
    had been taken when detained by the EPRLF.  The judge noted that on the
    applicant's own account he had been released  on  payment  of  a  bribe
    after  assisting  the   authorities,   which   the   judge   considered
    inconsistent with any real risk of further detention and  ill-treatment
    by them.

12.  The judge considered that  returning  to  live  amongst  the  LTTE  was
    inconsistent with the applicant's asserted fear of punishment  by  that
    organisation for allegedly giving information to the authorities.   The
    applicant was also said to have given conflicting explanations for  his
    scars.  In order to understand that we look  at  paragraph  11  of  the
    determination.  There the judge noted that, in  respect  of  the  scars
    claimed to have been caused by torture, the  applicant  had  denied  in
    answer to question 117 that he had  sustained  any  injuries  from  the
    beatings or scars but that he had  swellings  on  his  body  and  blood
    clottings.  When asked about the injuries from  shelling  in  1997  the
    applicant pointed to his forehead and scalp and said "I was attacked by
    a piece of shell on my head and also I have an injury to my leg".  This
    led the judge to record that he did not consider  it  likely  that  the
    medical  report  could  materially  assist  the  credibility   of   the
    applicant.

13.  The judge concluded at paragraph 34 of  the  determination  by  finding
    that the applicant "has fabricated key elements  of  the  core  of  his
    claim.  I do not accept that the appellant was arrested,  detained  and
    ill-treated as claimed".  At paragraph 35  the  judge  found  that  the
    scars, such as they were, not likely to attract the  adverse  attention
    of the authorities on return.

The applicant's submissions

14.  The nature of the fresh claim submissions is  essentially  as  follows.
    They comprised a medical report from Dr Josse, a  medical  practitioner
    with long experience including working  for  the  Metropolitan  Police.
    There were also witness statements from two  individuals  whom  I  will
    describe as NS and MT.  They both submitted  short  witness  statements
    attesting to the truth of the applicant's involvement with the LTTE and
    asserting knowledge that as a result thereof  the  applicant  had  been
    detained and ill-treated; and had finally left Sri Lanka for the United
    Kingdom.

The respondent's response

15.   The  respondent's  decision  of  23  October  2013  deals  with  these
    evidential materials.  The decision does  so  by  beginning  with,  and
    building upon (that is taking as its starting point) the  determination
    of the judge.  The decision set out reasons by reference to  background
    evidence why it  was  not  considered  that  as  at  October  2013  the
    applicant  had  a  genuine  fear  of  the  LTTE.    Essentially,   that
    organisation had ceased to be a force on the ground in Sri  Lanka  some
    time earlier.

16.  Reference was then made to the case of GJ and Others  (post-civil  war:
    returnees) Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]  UKUT  00319,  the  country  guidance
    findings of which were set  out  in  some  detail.   In  particular,  I
    observe that at paragraph 6 of the country guidance the Tribunal in  GJ
    found that there were no detention facilities at the airport  and  only
    those whose names appeared on a "stop list" would be detained from  the
    airport.  According to GJ, any risk for those in whom  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities are or become interested exists, not at  the  airport,  but
    after arrival in their home area, where their arrival will be  verified
    by the CID or police within a few days.

17.   The  determination  in  GJ  then  went  on  to  consider  the  current
    categories of persons thought to be at real risk of persecution  or  of
    serious harm on return to Sri Lanka, whether in detention or otherwise.
     These comprised individuals who are or are perceived to be a threat of
    the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they  are  or  are
    perceived to have a significant role in relation to post-conflict Tamil
    separatism within the Diaspora and/or a renewal of  hostilities  within
    Sri Lanka.  Then journalists or human rights activists  who  in  either
    case have criticised the Sri Lankan government, in particular its human
    rights record or who are associated with publications critical  of  the
    Sri Lankan government.  The next  category  was  individuals  who  have
    given evidence to the Lessons  Learned  and  Reconciliation  Commission
    implicating the Sri Lankan security forces, armed  forces  or  the  Sri
    Lankan authorities in alleged war crimes.  The  Tribunal  held  that  a
    person whose name appears on a computerised stop list accessible at the
    airport, comprising a list of those against whom  there  is  an  extant
    court order or arrest warrant, would be  stopped  at  the  airport  and
    handed over to the appropriate Sri Lankan authorities in  pursuance  of
    such an order or warrant.

18.  The respondent's letter  addressed  the  significance  of  the  country
    guidance case as follows.  It was not accepted that the applicant was a
    person whom the UNHCR eligibility guidelines describe  as  having  more
    elaborate links with the LTTE.  It had previously been found that there
    was no evidence that the authorities knew that the applicant had worked
    unwillingly as a helper for the LTTE.  It was not accepted,  and  there
    was no evidence to demonstrate, that the applicant was amongst those in
    the London Diaspora who had engaged in activities directed at  actively
    seeking to destabilise the Sri Lankan state.  The applicant was  not  a
    journalist or human rights activist.  There was  no  evidence  to  show
    that there was any extant court  order  or  arrest  warrant  registered
    against his name and it was therefore reasonable  in  the  respondent's
    view to conclude that the applicant's name  would  not  be  held  on  a
    computerised stop list.  Finally, as the applicant was not in Sri Lanka
    at the conclusion of  the  civil  war,  the  respondent  considered  it
    reasonable to conclude that he had not witnessed any alleged war crimes
    and  so  could  not  give  evidence  to   the   Lessons   Learned   and
    Reconciliation Commission.

19.  In summary, therefore, the respondent  considered  that  the  applicant
    did not fall into any of the risk categories identified by the Tribunal
    in GJ.  The letter concluded that the applicant was  no  more  than  an
    ordinary national of Sri Lanka returning to his home country who  would
    be of no adverse interest to the authorities.

20.  Having said all that, the letter turned to the evidence  of  Dr  Josse.
    The letter says this: "It is considered that this, [that is to say  the
    description and opinions  of  the  causes  of  scars]  was  an  opinion
    consisting mainly of pure speculation".  It was not accepted  that  the
    applicant  would  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities due to any scars on his body.  So far as the witnesses were
    concerned they were said to provide evidence that was "self-serving and
    subjective.  No objective evidence has been submitted which can support
    your claims".

21.  The respondent accordingly concluded, applying the well-known case  law
    in WM (DRC) [2006] EWCA Civ 1495, that any hypothetical judge would not
    be reasonably likely to allow the applicant's appeal.

22.  The grounds accompanying  the  application  for  judicial  review  take
    issue with the respondent's decision as follows.  They point  out  that
    MT was recognised as a refugee and that NS was  also  recognised  as  a
    refugee after a successful appeal when she was found  to  be  credible.
    The reference to Dr Josse's report  as  being  "pure  speculation"  was
    challenged as essentially being irrational:

         "A clinical finding that the applicant has scarring consistent with
         burns to the penis must logically be relevant to  the  question  of
         whether the applicant was tortured.  It is  difficult  to  see  how
         this scarring could arise ordinarily."


    Criticism was also made of the description of the  witnesses'  evidence
    as being "self-serving".

23.   After  permission  to  bring  judicial  review  proceedings  had  been
    granted, the respondent issued a supplementary decision  letter  on  28
    October 2014.  This returned to the evidence of Dr Josse.  It was noted
    that the doctor had given a detailed description and an opinion of  the
    scars on different parts of the applicant's  body.   It  was,  however,
    considered that the doctor's opinion:

         "consists mainly of a recount of your narrative of how you came  to
         have these scars. It is considered that this opinion is speculative
         as in the 'Facts' section Dr  Josse  wholly  accepts  your  account
         unquestioningly, quoting 'he was struck by the  butt  of  a  rifle,
         [and] a baton, kicked and punched being flung against a wall'."


24.  The letter noted that  Dr  Josse  had  been  shown  the  asylum  appeal
    determination but there was no reference in the doctor's report to  the
    fact that the Immigration Judge had rejected  the  credibility  of  the
    applicant.  Dr Josse did not acknowledge that rejection nor did he  say
    why he accepted the applicant's account.   The  letter  reiterated  the
    respondent's view that it would not be at all  likely  that  the  scars
    would draw the applicant to the adverse attention of the authorities at
    the point of return to Sri Lanka.  So far  as  the  witness  statements
    were concerned, it was again stated that these  were  self-serving  and
    subjective as no objective evidence  had  been  submitted  which  would
    support the claim.

         "We have reached this conclusion on the basis  that  the  witnesses
         were close friends of yours and the closeness existed in the United
         Kingdom at a time when you were  pursuing  your  asylum  claim  and
         spending time with the witnesses.  Furthermore you have  failed  to
         address that neither witness saw the events described  by  you  and
         are merely relying upon accounts given to them by you."

25.  Even though the witnesses had been accepted  to  be  refugees,  it  was
    pointed out by the respondent that each claim  made  by  an  individual
    asylum seeker fell to be considered  on  its  own  merits.   For  these
    reasons the evidence was considered to carry no weight  and  would  not
    have a realistic prospect of success as regards the hypothetical judge.

The submissions

26.  Ms Jegarajah's submissions essentially follow the form of  her  written
    grounds.  She emphasised, however, that the determination of the  judge
    was in a  Fast  Track  case  and  it  should  be  viewed  according  to
    subsequent case law  concerning  that  process.   She  highlighted  the
    professional background and history of Dr Josse, in particular his work
    with the police.  She pointed out that  the  injuries  set  out  in  Dr
    Josse's report are all recorded by him as  being  consistent  with  the
    explanation given by the applicant.

27.  The witnesses' evidence, Ms Jegarajah said,  was  indeed  self-serving,
    insofar as that phrase meant that the documentation had been  assembled
    in order to assist the applicant in  his  case.   The  witnesses  were,
    however, clearly people who knew the applicant well, including  through
    family connections.

28.  So far as the witnesses were concerned Ms Jegarajah  added  that  since
    they had been members of the LTTE in various capacities it was unlikely
    that they would want to go out of their way to help someone who had not
    been in that organisation by claiming falsely to a judge  that  he  had
    been.

29.  As regards the country  guidance  case  of  GJ  although  Ms  Jegarajah
    accepted that not all escapees would, as  such,  be  on  a  stop  list,
    nevertheless a hypothetical judge hearing  an  appeal  today  would  be
    asked on behalf  of  the  applicant  to  consider  that  the  fact  the
    applicant had escaped and his time spent in the Diaspora in the  United
    Kingdom would be reasonably likely to place him at  real  risk.   There
    was, according to Ms  Jegarajah,  more  than  a  fanciful  prospect  of
    success.

30.  Mr Malik submitted that the issue  comes  down  to  one  of  Wednesbury
    unreasonableness, that being the test which after some uncertainty  the
    Court of Appeal had concluded is the correct one to apply in  paragraph
    353 cases.  He categorised Ms Jegarajah's submissions on behalf of  the
    applicant as  amounting  to  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    respondent's conclusions.

31.  The Immigration Judge had made  robust  adverse  credibility  findings,
    which had not been disturbed on appeal.  Even if the applicant had been
    ill-treated in Sri Lanka, Mr Malik submitted that  the  nature  of  the
    country guidance was such as to give no comfort to the applicant  in  a
    hypothetical appeal brought today.  The respondent had correctly  taken
    the  judge's  determination  as  a  starting  point.   She  had  quoted
    extensively from the country guidance.  The two witness statements were
    self-serving.  Any problem as regards the  analysis  of  those  witness
    statements or indeed the report of Dr Josse had, Mr  Malik  said,  been
    cured by the supplementary letter where his primary case was  that  the
    original decision had been sufficient.

32.  In  reply  Ms  Jegarajah  stressed  the  eminence  of  Dr  Josse.   She
    reiterated the contention that, taken in  the  round,  the  applicant's
    case could well succeed today.  In  any  event  the  relatively  modest
    threshold set by the case law and paragraph 353 was satisfied.

Discussion

33.  I am grateful for  Counsel's  submissions.   The  question  for  me  is
    whether the respondent was entitled on Wednesbury grounds to reach  the
    conclusions she did in her decision under  challenge.   In  considering
    that, I must examine whether the requisite amount of  anxious  scrutiny
    has been applied.  In so doing, as the case  law  indicates,  there  is
    perhaps little space between such an analysis  and  stepping  into  the
    shoes of the Secretary of State so as to ask myself the direct question
    whether a hypothetical judge would be reasonably likely  to  allow  the
    appeal (YH v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ
    116; MN (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2011]
    EWCA Civ 193).

34.   The  respondent's  view  of  the  medical  evidence  is  in  my   view
    unquestionably valid.  The respondent was entitled  to  take  the  view
    that this report viewed in the round with the other evidence, including
    the findings of the judge, would not carry  the  applicant's  case  the
    relevant distance.  I accept the eminence of Dr Josse but any expert is
    only as good as his or her report and the respondent  in  my  view  was
    unquestionably entitled to conclude that the report was problematic  in
    that it had accepted at face value and without  any  qualification  the
    account given by the applicant.  The various injuries are in each  case
    merely said to be "consistent" with the account given by the applicant.
     It is easy at this remove to stand back and criticise a report written
    several years ago for not engaging,  amongst  other  things,  with  the
    Istanbul Protocol, which requires  experts  (inter  alia)  to  consider
    whether scars are consistent or highly consistent and to  explain  why;
    as  well  as  considering  other  possible  reasons  for  those  scars.
    Nevertheless, the report has manifest failings and the  respondent  was
    entitled to note them and as a result give the report little weight.

35.  I find little merit in the criticism of the original  decision  letter,
    as regards its  reference  to  Dr  Josse's  report  being  "an  opinion
    consisting mainly of pure speculation".  It  is  clear  what  point  is
    being made about  the  report  in  that  letter  and,  indeed,  in  the
    supplementary letter.

36.  So  far  as  the  witness  statements  are  concerned,  it  is  perhaps
    unfortunate that the term "self-serving" is used as widely as it is  in
    cases  involving  contested  evidence  in   claims   to   international
    protection.  However, looking at the decision, it is evident that  what
    the respondent was in effect saying was this:   in  the  light  of  the
    cogent adverse credibility findings of  the  Immigration  Judge,  which
    remained undisturbed, the fact that these  witnesses  were  now  coming
    forward as friends of the applicant was a matter of some  significance,
    in  deciding  hypothetically  what  weight  might  be  given  to  their
    evidence.

37.  Ms Jegarajah submitted that it would be unlikely  for  those  who  were
    genuinely in the LTTE  to  lie  about  the  LTTE  background  of  third
    parties.  That may be so; but it does not necessarily  follow;  and  on
    the evidence before us, we do not know about the views of the witnesses
    in this regard.  Further, the nature of the evidence  set  out  in  the
    witness statements is somewhat thin and, in  some  respects,  indirect.
    Ms Jegarajah is quite right to say that hearsay evidence is permissible
    in Tribunals.  Nevertheless, these matters  are  all  plainly  relevant
    ones in assessing the weight that might be given to the statements.

38.  I find that the original decision letter shows no  absence  of  anxious
    scrutiny or Wednesbury unreasonableness. But in any event,  the  fuller
    explanation given in the letter of 28 October undoubtedly  carries  the
    respondent's case the requisite distance.

39.  However, the country guidance aspect of this case strikes me as on  any
    view highly significant.  The country guidance in GS has been  referred
    to by me earlier in this judgment and I need not repeat  it.   What  is
    striking about it is that, even  if  one  takes  the  applicant's  case
    regarding his experiences in Sri Lanka at its highest, there is frankly
    nothing to place him within any relevant risk category.   The  scarring
    on the visible parts of  his  body  would  not  attract  the  requisite
    adverse attention at the airport.  The fact that he had secured release
    on payment of a bribe several years ago does not bring him  within  the
    category of those who are likely to be on a stop list.  The  fact  that
    he comes from the United Kingdom would be known to the authorities but,
    again, it is plain from the country guidance that significantly more in
    that regard is needed in order to reach the point  of  being  within  a
    risk category.

40.  I accept fully that the country guidance in GJ is not  to  be  regarded
    as a tick list.  However, stepping back and even if I were to reject Mr
    Malik's submissions on Wednesbury and put myself in the position of the
    Secretary of State, I see nothing in the applicant's case  to  make  it
    more than fanciful that  a  hypothetical  judge,  applying  the  extant
    country guidance, would find in the applicant's favour.  However,  this
    is very much in the nature of an alternative finding.

41.  For the reasons that I have articulated, I  find  that  the  respondent
    was entitled to refuse to treat the applicant's submissions as a  fresh
    claim, not only by reference to the country guidance but  also  on  the
    basis that the three strands of evidence put forward did not carry  the
    applicant to the point where it could be said there  was  a  reasonable
    likelihood that a hypothetical judge would find in his favour.

42.  For all these reasons this application is refused.

Costs
     Mr Malik makes an application for the costs  of  the  proceedings.   In
    the light of my judgment he is unquestionably entitled  to  costs.   He
    has handed to me documentation indicating the sum which the  respondent
    seeks from the applicant.  It amounts to a grand total of �4,840.

     Ms Jegarajah objects to that in a number of respects.   She  points  to
    the number of fee earners listed as having been engaged  on  the  case.
    She considers that the sum of �1,792 for "attendances on documents" is,
    in particular, excessive and as far as I understand her, she challenges
    the fees of  Counsel  set  out  as  �830  for  advice,  conference  and
    documents and �1,044 as fees for the hearing, that  being  broken  down
    between the substantive and the permission hearings.

     I have had regard to what Ms Jegarajah has said.   I  have  also  noted
    what she says about the means of her client, the applicant, who is said
    to be relying on  the  charity  of  others  in  order  to  bring  these
    proceedings.

     So far as the number of fee earners is  concerned,  Mr  Malik  explains
    that this has been partly due to a fee earner leaving and partly to one
    being on  holiday.   Any  organisation,  whether  it  be  the  Treasury
    Solicitor or a private firm of solicitors, plainly has to take  account
    of matters of that kind and I have heard nothing to  suggest  that  the
    amount should be  reduced  as  a  consequence  of  it.   The  fees  for
    attendances on documents strike  me  as  not  inappropriate  given  the
    history of  these  proceedings  and  the  interaction  which  has  been
    necessary as between the Treasury Solicitor and Mr  Malik,  at  various
    stages during them.  Mr Malik's own fees I consider to be on their face
    entirely reasonable for a matter of this kind.

     So far as the applicant's means are concerned, Ms Jegarajah  said  that
    it would not be in the State's interest to have this sum awarded, since
    there would be little if any  point  in  enforcing  the  order.   As  I
    pointed out to Ms Jegarajah, enforcement is not a matter for me.  It is
    open to the applicant to make such submissions as he sees  fit  to  the
    Secretary of State.

     In all the circumstances, and bearing fully in mind what  Ms  Jegarajah
    has said, I have concluded that the sum of �4,840 is reasonable in  all
    the circumstances and I  therefore  order  the  applicant  to  pay  the
    respondent's costs in that amount.~~~~0~~~~
