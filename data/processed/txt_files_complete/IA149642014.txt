Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the decision  by  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to grant him leave to remain as a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur)  Migrant,  and  against   the   Secretary   of   State's
    concomitant decision to remove him under Section 47 of  the  2006  Act.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do
    not consider that the appellant requires to be accorded  anonymity  for
    these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant made his  application  on  28  March  2013,  and  he  was
    interviewed about his application in Sheffield  on  21  February  2014.
    His application was refused  on  7  March  2014  on  non-points-scoring
    grounds.  The Secretary of State  was  not  satisfied  that  he  was  a
    genuine entrepreneur.  The Secretary of State  gave  extensive  reasons
    for making this assertion, quoting extensively from documents which the
    appellant had provided in support of his application and from questions
    and answers in the interview.  One of the areas of concern was funding.
     He stated he had access to funds of more than �50,000 which  had  been
    provided by a third party funder, who was family friend.   He  said  in
    interview that he had not invested any of the  money  yet  and  it  was
    still available.  The UKVI had sent his documents for verification with
    NIB Bank who confirmed that at  the  date  stated  on  the  letter  the
    balance stated was correct.  But on 12 June 2013 the balance had fallen
    to PKR4,400, which was equivalent to �28,95.  So his claim in interview
    that there were more than �50,000 of funds still  available,  and  that
    they remained untouched in NIB Bank, was clearly incorrect.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant's appeal came before Judge S  Taylor  sitting  at  Taylor
    House on 3 December 2014.  The appellant appeared in person, and  there
    was no Presenting  Officer.   The  appellant  gave  oral  evidence.  He
    understood the main issue which he had to answer was that  the  �50,000
    required was no longer in the funder's account.  His funder, Mr  Bilal,
    told him he still had the  money  and  that  the  money  had  not  been
    withdrawn.  He was satisfied that Mr Bilal  could  transfer  the  funds
    when he needed them.  He trusted Mr Bilal.

 4. In his subsequent decision, the judge observed at paragraph [9] that it
    would have been helpful to have had  a  verification  report  from  the
    respondent, or a copy of the letter from NIB Bank, confirming that  the
    funds had been removed as of June 2013.   However,  the  assertion  had
    been made in the refusal letter and the appellant had  been  unable  to
    answer the allegation.  In the absence of any documentary evidence that
    the funds were still available, he found that the appellant  no  longer
    had access to �50,000 from  his  business;  and  that  the  funds  were
    withdrawn by his funder prior to the decision being made.  Accordingly,
    he found the appellant failed to  qualify  for  points  in  respect  of
    access to funds.

 5. At paragraph [10], the judge held that as the appellant had  failed  to
    qualify for points in such a fundamental area, he had  also  failed  to
    satisfy paragraphs 245DD(h) and (i).  In the circumstances, he found it
    would be superfluous to consider  all  of  the  answers  given  at  the
    interview.  The appellant clearly did not have the  funds  as  claimed,
    and he had made no attempt to provide documentary  evidence  of  having
    the funds.  So he was also not satisfied the appellant  had  a  genuine
    business proposition to establish a business in the UK, and thus he did
    not meet the requirements of paragraph 245DD(k).



The Eventual Grant of Permission to Appeal

 6. The appellant was  refused  permission  to  appeal  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, but was granted permission to appeal on a renewed application
    to the Upper Tribunal.  On 14 May 2015  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul
    granted permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable that, as the renewed grounds aver at [2], the  judge
         erred in law in requiring the appellant to prove that the  relevant
         funds were still available to him, given that  the  respondent  had
         provided no evidence in support of that assertion.  It may also  be
         arguable that the judge  erred  in  taking  into  account  [9]  the
         appellant's failure to adduce  additional  evidence  to  rebut  the
         respondent's assertion, as it may be that  section  85A  (4)  would
         have prevented such evidence from being adduced.

         Permission is granted on all grounds.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 7. In advance of the hearing before me, John Parkinson of  the  Specialist
    Appeals Team settled a  Rule  24  response  opposing  the  appeal.   He
    submitted that the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  directed
    himself appropriately.  The  appellant  had  produced  no  evidence  to
    demonstrate the respondent was incorrect  in  the  assertion  that  the
    funds were unavailable.  The respondent made it clear that the bank was
    contacted and had confirmed the balance was  minimal.   The  respondent
    was not challenged on the evidence of this enormous reduction, and  the
    determination was not fatally flawed.

 8. Ms Fijiwala did not adopt her colleague's Rule 24 response.  She agreed
    with Mr Jafar that the judge had materially erred in law, and that  the
    decision should be set aside and remade.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

 9. The position taken by Ms Fijiwala at the hearing is  not  determinative
    of the issue which I have to decide.  However, I am in  no  doubt  that
    she was right to concede that the decision discloses a  material  error
    of law.

10. The judge was wrong to decide the appeal against the appellant  on  the
    sole ground that he had not rebutted  the  assertion  in  the  decision
    letter that the balance in the funder's bank account had  dropped  from
    over �53,000 sterling equivalent at the date of application  to  nearly
    zero as at June 2013.

11. This was only one concern, amongst many other concerns  raised  in  the
    refusal letter, which cumulatively  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the
    appellant was not a genuine entrepreneur.  The fact that the appellant,
    a lay person, thought that the removal of  funds  was  the  main  issue
    which he had to deal with in the appeal did not relieve  the  judge  of
    the obligation to consider the reasons for refusal in the round, and to
    decide whether the decision was right in substance, having regard inter
    alia to the appellant's performance in interview.

12. If the judge had reviewed the interview, he would have  noted  that  it
    had not been put to the appellant  in  interview  that  the  funds  had
    disappeared from the funder's bank account.  This in  turn  highlighted
    the importance of the respondent producing proof of the allegation that
    the funds had vanished.  In accordance  with  general  principles,  the
    burden rested with the respondent to prove that the balance had dropped
    to nearly zero as of June 2013.  The  burden  did  not  rest  with  the
    appellant to disprove this allegation.

13. Following Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT  365
    it is arguable that the  appellant  was  in  any  event  debarred  from
    adducing evidence in rebuttal of the allegation.  For it was not  being
    alleged that he had  produced  a  false  document  in  support  of  his
    application.  On the contrary, it was  accepted  that  the  documentary
    evidence of funding as at the  date  of  application  was  genuine  and
    valid.  The allegation was simply that the funding which  had  appeared
    to be in place at the date of application was no longer in  place.   So
    if Ahmed and Another is good  law,  the  appellant  could  not  provide
    additional evidence by way of rebuttal of it. This would be  manifestly
    unfair and would render a refusal decision which was  solely  based  on
    such an allegation a decision which was not in accordance with the law.

14. Accordingly, on this particular issue  (the  alleged  disappearance  of
    funds from the account) the judge should have found that the burden  of
    proof had not been discharged by the Secretary of State and/or that she
    could not rely on post-application evidence where the appellant was not
    allowed to rely on  post-application  evidence  on  the  same  discrete
    issue.

15. It is argued in the grounds of appeal that the judge should have  found
    that the entire refusal decision was not in accordance with the law, as
    the appellant had not been given  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  the
    concerns expressed in the refusal letter before the Secretary of  State
    reached her conclusion that he was not a genuine entrepreneur.

16. I find that this case is not made out.  The other  concerns  raised  in
    the refusal letter  are  based  on  what  the  appellant  said  in  the
    interview, and  on  what  the  Secretary  of  State  has  gleaned  from
    documents which the  appellant  provided  with  his  application.   So,
    unlike the allegation relating to the disappearance of funds  from  the
    funder's account, the Secretary of State does not purport  to  rely  on
    post-application evidence of which the appellant is unaware, and  which
    has neither been disclosed to him nor to  the  Tribunal.   So  all  the
    other concerns raised in the refusal  letter  are  concerns  which  are
    fairly raised, and they  can  be  fairly  resolved  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by an examination of the relevant material.

17. As the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  engage  with  the  other
    concerns raised in the refusal letter, both parties have been  deprived
    of a fair hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, and the proper course (as
    agreed by Mr Jafar and Ms Fijiwala) is that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal should be set aside  in  its  entirety,  and  the  appeal
    remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  de  novo  hearing  before
    another judge.



Conclusion

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly the decision is set aside in its entirety.

Directions

19. This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House  for
    a de novo hearing before any judge apart from Judge S Taylor.

20. My provisional time estimate for the hearing is two hours. None of  the
    findings of fact made by the previous Tribunal are to be preserved.

No anonymity direction is made.
