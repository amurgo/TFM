For the Respondent:    Miss D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  25th  December,  1992.
    He applied for entry clearance  to  join  his  partner  in  the  United
    Kingdom under Appendix FM.  The respondent refused that application  on
    21st December, 2016 and the appellant appealed  that  decision  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal which heard it at Birmingham on 1st December, 2017.



2.   Before me today it was accepted that there were errors of  law  in  the
    judge's determination such that the evidence before First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Burke showed that the sponsor's income was more  than  sufficient
    to  satisfy  the  requirements  of   the   Immigration   Rules.    Both
    representatives agreed that the appeal should be allowed and I am happy
    to allow it.

3.   The appellant's appeal is allowed.


Richard Chalkley
Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and I have considered making a  fee  award  and
have decided to make a fee award of any fee which has been paid  or  may  be
payable.

Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley
