                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against a decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Raikes ('the Judge') promulgated on the 14 November 2019 in which the
       Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.
    2. Permission to appeal was granted on  a  renewed  application  by  the
       Upper Tribunal in the following terms:

           "The appellant's claim before the FtT was advanced on the  basis
           that he satisfied paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Immigration
           Rules. It was said, in particular, that he suffered from a  poor
           mental health; that he had been in the UK for a number of years;
           and that he had no support network to which  he  could  turn  in
           Pakistan.


           The appeal was dismissed  by  Judge  Raikes  and  permission  to
           appeal was refused in the FtT by Judge  Parkes.  I  consider  it
           arguable, for the reasons  given  in  the  grounds,  that  Judge
           Raikes erred, at [35], in finding that the appellant  had  given
           inconsistent evidence about his contract with his family. It  is
           also arguable that the Judge failed to  take  material  evidence
           into account when she concluded that  those  who  supported  the
           appellant in the UK could remit funds to him in Pakistan: [41].


           The third ground of appeal is that the judge misdirected herself
           in  law  at  [61]  when  she  considered  whether   there   were
           insurmountable  obstacles  to  reintegration.   The   test   was
           obviously whether  there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to
           reintegration. The ground is unarguable. It is quite clear  that
           the judge was aware of the proper test: [7] and [45] refer.  The
           slip at [61] was evidently just that, and not a misdirection  on
           the test to be applied.


           Even if grounds one and two are made out, it may  well  be  that
           the Upper Tribunal decides not to set aside the decision of  the
           FtT.  Taking the claim at its highest, it  seems  doubtful  that
           the threshold in Kamara [2016] 4 WLR 152 and Parveen [2018] EWCA
           Civ 932 can be reached. It would not be  appropriate  to  refuse
           permission on that  basis  but  the  question  must  clearly  be
           considered by the appellant's representatives."

    3. Permission was therefore granted on Grounds 1 and 2  but  refused  on
       Ground 3.

Error of law

    4. The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  born  1  January  1943  who
       entered the UK as a visitor with leave valid to 4 October 2006. On 27
       August 2010, the appellant was served with IS151A. On 19 August 2011,
       the appellant claimed asylum which was refused on 16  September  2011
       with no right of appeal. Notwithstanding this, on 3 October 2011  the
       appellant lodged an appeal with the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  was
       dismissed on 3 November 2011.  By  6  December  2011,  the  appellant
       became appeal rights exhausted. On 30th August appellant  was  served
       with RED.0001 after which he made one human  rights  application  and
       two EEA residence card applications between 2015  and  2017,  all  of
       which were refused, the first with an out of country right of  appeal
       and the other two with no  right  of  appeal,  after  which  he  made
       another application for leave to remain on the grounds of his medical
       condition pursuant to paragraph 276 ADE, Article 3 ECHR  and  on  the
       basis of family and private life pursuant to Article 8 ECHR.
    5. The Judge had the  benefit  of  considering  both  written  and  oral
       evidence which is summarised in the  decision  under  challenge.  The
       Judge's findings and reasons are set out between [32  -  73]  of  the
       decision.
    6. Ground 1 asserted the Judge has made a mistake of fact and failed  to
       have proper regard to the evidence in  relation  to  the  appellant's
       circumstances in Pakistan. The Judge noted at [35] that the appellant
       claimed he had been effectively estranged from his family in Pakistan
       and had not spoken to any of them since he left in 2006 yet noted  at
       [23(b)] the appellant's evidence he had had previous contact with the
       daughter  who  had  given  birth  although  when  he  rang   to   say
       congratulations she hung up on him.  It is said the finding the claim
       to be estranged appeared to be in apparent contrast to the  claim  he
       had contacted one of his daughters 8 to 9 months  ago  is  a  finding
       infected by arguable error on the basis that although  the  appellant
       attempted to speak to his daughter he was unsuccessful.
    7. Paragraph [35] appears within the section of the  decision  in  which
       the Judge was considering the evidence as a whole and making relevant
       findings upon the same. The appellant did not hide the  fact  he  has
       three daughters and two sons in Pakistan but claimed he was estranged
       from them as a result of his wife's death. He also  claimed  that  if
       returned he has no means of supporting himself and no housing.
    8. It is important to read the evidence and decision as a  whole  rather
       than the specific limited sections. Those relating to  the  challenge
       set out in Ground 1 are to be found at [35 - 36] in which  the  Judge
       writes:

           "35.   In his evidence today I note that  whilst  the  Appellant
                accepted that he had family in Pakistan, he maintained  that
                he was effectively estranged from them as a  result  of  his
                wife's death. However, whilst he went on to indicate that he
                had not spoken to any of them since he left Pakistan in 2006
                due to their hatred of  him,  he  then  stated  in  apparent
                contrast to this that he had contacted one of his  daughters
                some eight or  nine  months  ago  as  she  had  given  birth
                although he stated that she had then hung up the phone  when
                she realised it was him. Further, whilst he  explained  that
                his family had disowned him after his wife's death, he  was,
                in my view, unable to clearly to explain,  or  indeed  chose
                not to explain, why this would have stopped him returning to
                his own home and business as a shopkeeper, or even returning
                to another area of Pakistan if he  chose  to  once  his  six
                month visit Visa had expired. I find that  even  if  he  was
                uncomfortable at the prospect of his family's reaction  upon
                return, there was no suggestion, for  instance,  that  there
                was any threat or danger to him on return.  Indeed,  I  note
                that he claimed asylum in 2011 and whilst  the  grounds  are
                unknown, his appeal was rejected then.


           36.    In addition to the above, whilst I accept that he  has  a
                poor memory and has been referred for dementia, he was  able
                to clearly recall his home and what type of business he had,
                selling spices notably chilli, when he left Pakistan to come
                to the UK yet on the other hand when questioned  was  unable
                to fully recall why his family blamed him for their mother's
                death following an accident. He was also unable  to  clearly
                explain, other than that he had heard of the  birth  of  his
                grandchild, why having claimed to have effectively run  away
                from his family in Pakistan over two years after his  wife's
                death as a result of what he states was them blaming him, he
                had suddenly decided to contact his daughter eight  or  nine
                months ago some 13 years after leaving Pakistan and arriving
                in the UK. On this basis I do not  accept,  given  both  his
                inconsistent and at times  when  asked  directly  about  the
                situation, his vague evidence, that  the  lack  of  ties  or
                connections to Pakistan and lack of contact with his family,
                are as he claims."

    9. The Judge had the benefit in addition  to  the  written  evidence  of
       seeing and hearing oral evidence being given. The  grounds  challenge
       what is said to be an inconsistency between the claim  to  have  been
       estranged yet to have made contact with the daughter but that is  not
       the Judge's  core  finding  which  is  that  the  appellant's  claims
       regarding lack of contact with his family in Pakistan is not accepted
       as being credible.
   10. Ground 1 also asserts the Judges finding the appellant was  vague  in
       his answers as to why the family  in  Pakistan  blamed  him  for  his
       wife's death is flawed but the Judge had proper regard to the  manner
       in which the appellant gave his evidence,  taking  into  account  the
       finding he has a depressive disorder [33]. This  is  a  finding  made
       having reflecting on all the evidence generally.
   11. The weight to be given to the evidence was a matter for the Judge and
       it has not been shown the weight  the  Judge  gave  to  the  same  is
       arguably irrational or outside the range of findings available to the
       Judge.
   12. In relation to paragraph 276 ADE, the Judge clearly took into account
       the appellant's evidence as a whole in which it is found at [44]  the
       appellant had not demonstrated that he has  no  social  and  cultural
       ties to Pakistan. The Judge took  into  account  the  submission  the
       appellant will face very significant obstacles to his integration but
       did not find that have been made out at [45], having considered  both
       the appellant's medical needs and situation generally.
   13. Ground 2 relates to financial support. The appellant's  evidence  was
       that he was being supported in the UK by a Mr Chaudhary with whom  he
       lived and who provides a nominal sum of  �5  to  �10  per  week.  The
       evidence from this person was that he could not  financially  support
       the appellant if he is to return to Pakistan as he  has  a  wife  and
       four children to support in the UK, is a self-employed  taxi  driver,
       who claimed to be already struggling  to  fulfil  his  own  financial
       commitments. The Judge is challenged  for  finding  the  witness  was
       unable to provide a plausible explanation for why he could not assist
       the appellant in the same way Pakistan which is said to be a  finding
       that fails to have proper regard  to  the  explanation  provided.  Mr
       Chaudhary  could  not  accommodate  the  appellant  as  part  of  his
       household if he had been removed to Pakistan and there  was  evidence
       there  would  be  insufficient  funds  to  financially  support   the
       appellant in Pakistan which it is claimed the Judge failed to  engage
       with.
   14. At [58] the Judge noted  that  two  witnesses  provide  a  degree  of
       financial support to the appellant in the United  Kingdom  but  found
       they were unable to provide a plausible reason as to why  they  could
       not assist  the  appellant  if  he  was  returned  to  Pakistan.  The
       explanation was given in light of the oral evidence that only limited
       financial assistance was available as a result of their own financial
       needs.  Notwithstanding,  the  Judge  concludes  at  [58]  that   the
       explanation was  not  found  to  be  plausible.  Whilst  the  grounds
       disagree with this finding it has not been made out this  finding  is
       not reasonably open to the Judge having seen and heard  the  evidence
       and having attached the weight to the same the Judge felt appropriate
       in all the circumstances of this appeal.
   15. Also, at [57] the Judge writes "Despite the  assertion  by  him  that
       there is no one to him there, I am satisfied that he has family there
       and even whether due to societal constraints is daughters were unable
       to provide for him and his son did not speak to him, he accepts  that
       he has a brother and has provided little, if any, explanation  as  to
       why he does not speak to him why he would not assist him were  he  to
       return." The Judge's findings in  relation  to  the  availability  of
       financial support is therefore not limited to the  support  from  the
       two witnesses in the UK. There is merit in the submission  that  even
       if the witness who currently provides accommodation and pocket  money
       to the appellant could help no further, for the reason stated, it had
       not been made out any error in this regard is material  in  light  of
       the lack of clarity in the evidence given to the Judge regarding  the
       full range of available family support.
   16. The Judge summarises her position in relation to  Article  8  outside
       the Immigration Rules as [61] the following terms:

           "61.   It is against my findings of fact, consideration  of  the
                case law and the objective evidence presented  that  I  must
                then consider the Appellant's human rights under Article  8.
                I note that the Appellant  did  not  seek  to  rely  on  the
                requirements of  Appendix  FM  and  I  have  considered  the
                requirements of paragraph 276 ADE above. I am satisfied that
                given his circumstances and the findings I have  made  there
                are no insurmountable obstacles to his return. Whilst he may
                not now be able to work,  he  has  family  there  who  I  am
                satisfied would provide assistance to  him,  and  access  to
                medical care which whilst not of the same standard as in the
                UK, is still available."

   17. The Judge had found in the preceding paragraphs  that  the  appellant
       would be able to reintegrate and re-establish  his  private  life  in
       Pakistan.
   18. Article 8 ECHR outside  the  Rules  is  considered  from  [62]  in  a
       properly structured manner confirming, having weighed  the  competing
       factors, that requiring the appellant to return to Pakistan will  not
       result in an unwarranted interference in a right protected by Article
       8, making his removal from the United Kingdom proportion.
   19. Whilst the appellant clearly wishes to remain in the  United  Kingdom
       and disagrees with the findings of the Judge, any  error  established
       has not been found to  be  material.  The  threshold  in  Kamara  and
       Parveen have not been shown to be reached on the basis  the  evidence
       before the Judge.
   20. Whilst the appellant disagrees with the  findings  made  and  clearly
       wished to remain in the United Kingdom he fails to establish arguable
       legal error material to the decision to dismiss the appeal sufficient
       to warrant the Upper Tribunal interfering  any  further  in  relation
       this matter.

Decision

   21. There is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.

  Anonymity.

   22. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
