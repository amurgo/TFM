Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Ijezie (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant's appeal against decisions to refuse to  vary  her  leave
    and to remove her from the United Kingdom by way  of  directions  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  was
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Raymond  ("the  judge")  in  a
    determination promulgated on 6th August 2014.  The judge determined the
    appeal on the basis of the documentary evidence before him in the light
    of the appellant's indication in her notice of appeal that she did  not
    require an oral hearing.

2.   The judge found that the appellant had worked more  than  twenty  hours
    per week, thereby breaching the  conditions  attached  to  her  student
    leave.  This leave was extended under section 3C of the Immigration Act
    1971.  He found that the period in which the appellant worked in excess
    of the permitted hours began  in  about  September  2012  and  extended
    through until 2013 and even up to the date of his  assessment  in  July
    2014.

3.   The Secretary of State also refused the application  for  leave  (which
    was made on the basis of the appellant's relationship with her  spouse)
    on the basis that no sufficient proficiency in English had been  shown.
    The appellant relied upon a letter from NARIC dated 22nd April 2014, in
    which it was  stated  that  the  degree  she  obtained  was  considered
    comparable to a British bachelor  degree.   The  judge  found  that  no
    proper explanation had been given for why NARIC  confirmation  did  not
    accompany the application made by the appellant in September  2012  and
    taking into account a letter from Leicester College which appeared  not
    to assist her case, the judge concluded that this ground of refusal was
    made out.

4.   The Secretary of State also refused the  application  under  E-LTRP.3.2
    because the appellant's gross  wages  could  not  be  accepted  (as  it
    appeared that they were earned in breach of conditions attached to  her
    leave) and her husband's income alone did not meet the  minimum  income
    threshold of �18,600.  The judge noted  that  in  the  application  she
    made, the appellant claimed to have an annual income  from  "permanent"
    employment with a care agency of  �11,543.88  per  annum,  whereas  her
    husband's income was less, in the sum of �8,993.10.  There appeared  to
    be no P60s showing her husband's income for 2012 to 2013.  Overall, the
    judge concluded that the income available  did  not  meet  the  minimum
    income threshold.  He went on to assess whether there were obstacles to
    family life continuing between the appellant and  her  husband  outside
    the United Kingdom.  He concluded  that  there  were  none  which  were
    insurmountable.  Finally, the judge took into account the Secretary  of
    State's finding that the private life  requirements  of  the  rules  in
    paragraph 276ADE were not met by the appellant, who arrived  here  from
    Nigeria in June 2011 and he concluded that the appellant had not  shown
    that this particular finding was unlawful.  There were  no  exceptional
    circumstances in the case which would justify the grant of leave to the
    appellant outside the rules, on Article 8 grounds.

5.   An application was made for permission to appeal.  It was contended  on
    the appellant's behalf that as her studies came to an end in  September
    2012, she  was  entitled  to  work  full-time  "during  vacation  which
    includes period after completion of her studies".  The judge  erred  in
    finding that the appellant  was  not  entitled  to  rely  on  her  full
    earnings.  The judge also erred in relation  to  a  letter  from  NARIC
    dated 22nd April 2014, which showed that  the  appellant's  degree  was
    taught in English.  Moreover, the  level  of  English  required  for  a
    spouse is A1, below level C1, which was assessed by NARIC as the  level
    achieved by the appellant in her studies.  Finally,  it  was  contended
    that the judge erred in  finding  that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in Nigeria.  It was not in  dispute
    that the appellant and her husband had a genuine and subsisting marital
    relationship.  Her spouse was a British citizen  and  his  parents  and
    siblings were settled here as well.

6.   Permission to appeal was refused and the application then renewed.   An
    Upper Tribunal Judge granted permission on 10th October  2014,  finding
    that the judge  may  have  erred  in  relation  to  his  assessment  of
    proficiency in the English language and that it was  arguable  that  he
    should have taken  into  account  the  appellant's  income.   She  also
    considered that the adverse conclusion in relation  to  Article  8  may
    have been based on a flawed assessment under the rules.

7.   In a rule 24 response dated 21st October 2014, the Secretary  of  State
    indicated that the appeal was  opposed.   The  judge  directed  himself
    appropriately and noted, at paragraph 26 of the determination, that the
    appellant's payslips recorded employment considerably in excess of  the
    permitted maximum and therefore in breach of the rules.

Submissions on Error of Law

8.   Mr Ijezie said that reliance was placed upon the grounds in support  of
    the renewed application, dated 9th September 2014.  The key  issue  was
    whether the appellant had worked in breach of the rules.   If  she  had
    not, that would demonstrate a material error in the decision.

9.   The appellant submitted an in-time application for leave  as  a  spouse
    and so the student leave she had at the time was extended by virtue  of
    section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.  Her student leave entitled her
    to work twenty hours per week during  termtime  but  for  an  unlimited
    amount of time in vacations.  It was not disputed that the  appellant's
    studies came to an end in September 2012 and from then on,  she  should
    be deemed to have been on vacation and entitled to work as much as  she
    wished.  Paragraph 245ZY(c)(i) made it clear  that  the  appellant  was
    entitled to work for not more than twenty  hours  during  termtime  but
    could work for any duration  in  vacation.   The  judge  was  wrong  to
    conclude that the appellant did not have the right  to  work  unlimited
    hours.

10.  Secondly, the NARIC letter at pages 2 to 3 of  the  bundle  before  the
    judge showed the level of proficiency in  the  English  language.   The
    appellant relied on a BA  qualification  from  a  Nigerian  university,
    comparable to British BA standard.  There  was  post-decision  evidence
    available to the Tribunal in the form of a second  NARIC  letter  dated
    22nd April 2014.  This evidence was admissible under section  85(4)  of
    the 2002 Act.  The  judge  was  able  to  consider  all  the  evidence,
    including the new evidence, as at the date of  the  hearing.   If  this
    evidence  were  accepted,  the  appellant  met  the  English   language
    requirements.  There was also a letter before the judge from  Leicester
    International  College,  confirming  what  appeared  in  the  CAS   the
    appellant  was  given.   The  letter  described  her  as  having   good
    competence in English and  as  suitable  for  her  course,  a  graduate
    diploma in management studies.  These showed that the appellant  had  a
    proficiency which was higher than A1, the level required  for  spouses.
    She was at least at level C1.

11.  Mr Ijezie suggested that no submissions were required  in  relation  to
    the financial requirements of the  rules  as  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepted that they were  met.   So  far  as  EX.1  was  concerned,  the
    appellant's case was that there were insurmountable obstacles to family
    life continuing in Nigeria.  Her husband  was  a  British  citizen  who
    could not be forced to live in Nigeria.  He had integrated  fully  into
    British  society.   If  the  appellant  were  removed,  this  would  be
    unlawful.  It was clear from Community law that even  where  a  spousal
    relationship was  formed  at  a  time  when  a  person  had  precarious
    immigration  status,  the  state  was  still  required  to  conduct   a
    proportionality exercise before seeking  to  remove  a  person.   Here,
    there was no legitimate aim outweighing the appellant's right to remain
    with her British citizen husband.

12.  Mr Wilding said that the decision contained no material  error  of  law
    in any respect.

13.  What the  evidence  showed,  and  what  was  apparent  in  the  judge's
    assessment, was that it was entirely unclear whether the appellant ever
    pursued the course for which she was given Tier 4 Student leave.  There
    was  confusion  regarding  the  hours  she  worked  between  April  and
    September 2012.  She  only  had  twenty  hours  a  week  available  for
    employment during her studies.  She  was  able  to  work  full-time  in
    vacation.  The difficulty she faced, as shown by paragraph  26  of  the
    determination, was that the judge found that the  payslips  she  relied
    upon showed that beginning in August or September 2012, she was working
    more than twenty hours per week.  The earliest payslip  made  available
    seemed to be dated 20th September 2012, which appeared to  show  103.25
    hours.  She was also accruing annual leave "units".  The judge made the
    point at paragraph 24 that the  2012  P60  the  appellant  relied  upon
    appeared compatible with part-time  work  not  exceeding  twenty  hours
    between September 2011 and 1st April 2012 but it shed no light on  what
    happened after that.  The appellant made available no payslips for  the
    period April to September 2012.

14.  Keeping the focus on the September  2012  payslip,  the  year  to  date
    figure appeared to show earnings of �5,751.  The  August  to  September
    2012 total earnings were �977 and  that  suggested  that  in  the  five
    months between  April  2012  and  August  that  year,  the  appellant's
    earnings were about �850 per month.

15.  There was, in fact, no clear  evidence  regarding  when  the  appellant
    completed her course.  The  letter  before  the  judge  from  Leicester
    College indicated only that the appellant had sat exams and was waiting
    for a result.  At paragraph 23 of the determination, the judge  weighed
    the evidence and found that the working hours  shown  in  the  payslips
    suggested that the appellant had failed her studies, not least  as  she
    might well have stated in evidence that she had been  awarded  the  ICM
    diploma, if she had in fact been successful.

16.  The Secretary of State's position was that  if  a  person  studied  and
    completed a course, employment might  be  available  but  if  a  person
    failed or dropped out then student leave would lapse and a person would
    not have permission to work.  For section 3C leave to  arise  and  take
    effect, the appellant would have to show completion of her studies  but
    the evidence made available  to  the  judge  did  not  support  such  a
    finding.  Overall, the  judge  came  to  a  sustainable  conclusion  in
    relation to the working hours, in the light  of  the  limited  evidence
    before him.  All he had to go on was what appeared in  the  appellant's
    bundle.

17.  The appellant's own witness statement appeared not to include  a  claim
    that she successfully completed her course.  The  evidence  before  the
    judge simply did not show that the appellant had the qualification  she
    embarked on her studies to achieve, in 2011.  The findings made by  the
    judge were open to him on the evidence.

18.  Turning to the proficiency in the English language aspect, Appendix  FM
    and FM-SE were relevant here.  The appellant's case was that she had  a
    qualification recognised by NARIC.  The relevant rule appeared  in  the
    current edition of Phelan at page 1040 and at page  1069.   What  FM-SE
    required was evidence of an academic qualification recognised by NARIC,
    the  evidence  being  either  a  certificate  issued  by  the  relevant
    institution confirming the award or an original academic reference from
    the institution awarding the  academic  qualification.   The  appellant
    relied  on  letters  from  NARIC  but  neither  met  this  requirement.
    Although the letter suggested that the appellant had CEFR level C1, the
    rules required evidence that the  qualification  was  equivalent  to  a
    British degree and taught in English.  Neither  of  the  NARIC  letters
    confirmed this.

19.  Finally, dealing with the Article 8  aspect,  the  appellant  had  only
    limited leave and so her status was precarious.  The judge gave  cogent
    reasons why there were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing in Nigeria Of course, the appellant's husband could  not  be
    forced to go there as he was a British citizen but the judge  had  this
    fact in mind.  Again, all the judge had before him was the  documentary
    evidence, including the appellant's witness statement.

20.  Mr Ijezie said in response that at paragraph 25  of  the  determination
    the judge noted that the Secretary of State had not  made  calculations
    of working hours during the period June 2011 to June  2012,  while  the
    appellant was on her course.  The respondent  had  a  duty  to  provide
    reasons but had not done so here.  Even though the Secretary  of  State
    had stated in refusing the application that the position was not clear,
    there was a duty of candour and evidence might have been invited.   The
    Secretary of State had not made a  determination  on  any  final  basis
    regarding the income threshold  because  of  her  conclusion  that  the
    appellant had breached the requirements of the rules.   The  judge  was
    obliged to find sufficient reasons, to sustain the Secretary of State's
    decision.

21.  On English language proficiency, Mr Ijezie maintained his  stance  that
    the letters from NARIC met the requirements of the rules,  even  though
    no evidence from the awarding body  was  submitted.   Even  though  the
    NARIC letters might not be on all fours, he said that the  requirements
    of the rules were  met.   The  evidence  from  Leicester  International
    College fell to be taken into  account  and  this  confirmed  that  the
    appellant was a good candidate and had good English.  In any event,  he
    said, the English language requirement was not  absolute.   There  were
    exceptions to it.  The appellant  might  rely  on  EX.1  as  E-LTRP.4.2
    applied unless that exception applied.  (Mr Wilding said at this  point
    that the adverse decisions were made on 18th March 2014 and the rule Mr
    Ijezie had just described came into effect on 28th July 2014.)

22.  Mr Ijezie said that it was clear from the determination that no  proper
    proportionality assessment had been made, by either  the  Secretary  of
    State or the judge.  The legitimate aim sought to be  pursued  was  not
    identified.  There was no public interest in removing the appellant and
    no proper consideration of her interest  in  remaining  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Taking all of that into account, the  proper  outcome  was  a
    weighing of the competing interests resulting  in  a  decision  in  the
    appellant's favour.

Conclusion on Error of Law

23.  For no doubt sensible reasons, the appellant decided that she  did  not
    require an oral hearing, at which she and her husband might have  given
    evidence.  Instead, she indicated that she  wished  her  appeal  to  be
    decided "on the papers". The determination shows that the  judge  fully
    engaged with the Secretary of State's case and the detailed reasons for
    refusing the application and also engaged with the documentary evidence
    made available by the appellant, which included a witness statement.

24.  It is readily apparent from the determination that  the  evidence  made
    available by the appellant was,  with  respect  to  her,  uncertain  in
    several important respects.  For example, the  appellant  suggested  in
    her statement that her studies were completed in September 2012 but, as
    the judge observed at paragraph 10, it was  not  apparent  whether  she
    meant  by  this  that  she  achieved  the   qualification   sought,   a
    postgraduate diploma.  The examination  results  sent  to  her  college
    showed a pass in three subjects and results awaited in another.   There
    were other uncertainties in the evidence, including in relation to  the
    hours the appellant worked, particularly before September 2012.

25.  It is not sensibly open to the appellant to  criticise  the  judge  for
    making the findings he did on the limited  evidence  available  to  the
    Tribunal. The Secretary of State's reasons for refusing her application
    were unambiguous.  For example, the Secretary of State's assessment  of
    the wage slips was that they gave the appearance of working  more  than
    the permitted hours.  It was up to  the  appellant  to  show  that  the
    requirements of the rules were met and that she did not act  in  breach
    of the conditions attached to her student leave  and,  having  received
    the adverse decisions and commenced her appeal, it was  up  to  her  to
    provide sufficient evidence in support of her case.

26.  The judge was, I find, entitled to weigh the  limited  evidence  before
    him as he did, in relation to breach of conditions.  The  evidence  did
    not clearly show any success in the course or that  the  appellant  was
    awarded the qualification she sought.  The judge was entitled  to  draw
    an inference that she probably failed and he was entitled to take  this
    into account in his assessment of the evidence regarding working hours.
     Overall, I conclude that his assessment was open to him  and  that  no
    material error of law has been shown.

27.  So far as proficiency in the English language is concerned,  the  judge
    found  that  the  evidence  was  not  sufficient  to  show   that   the
    requirements of the rules were met.  The appellant  relied  on  letters
    from NARIC but  in  this  context  I  accept  Mr  Wilding's  submission
    regarding the rules.  The relevant part of Appendix  FM-SE  requires  a
    certificate or similar evidence from the awarding body but there was no
    such evidence before  the  judge.   The  letters  from  NARIC  were  in
    themselves insufficient to show that the requirements of the rules were
    met.  Again, no material error of law has been  shown  in  the  judge's
    assessment.

28.  Finally, the rather slight evidence before the  judge,  accepting  that
    the genuine and subsisting relationship between the appellant  and  her
    husband is not in issue, led him to conclude that family life could  be
    continued in Nigeria and that there were no insurmountable obstacles to
    this course.  The appellant's husband is  a  British  citizen  but  the
    judge did not overlook this.  Mr  Ijezie  submitted  that  neither  the
    Secretary of State's decision nor the determination showed  any  proper
    assessment  of  the  proportionality  of  the  adverse  decisions.    I
    disagree.  The Secretary of State considered the  requirements  of  the
    rules under paragraph 276ADE, following her decision that  the  partner
    requirements of the rules were not met and the  judge  made  a  similar
    assessment,  at  paragraphs  45  to  51  of  the  determination.    The
    assessment was carefully made,  as  paragraphs  46  and  47  show,  for
    example.  In the assessment, the judge took into  account  his  earlier
    findings that the requirements of the rules were not met.  It is  clear
    from paragraphs 50 and 51  of  the  determination  that  he  considered
    whether the appellant might succeed under Article 8  even  outside  the
    rules, concluding that she could not.  I find that no material error of
    law has been shown in this part of his reasoning.  He was  entitled  to
    conclude as he did in the light of the evidence before him.

29.  In summary,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  no
    material error of law and shall stand.  I gave my decision and a  brief
    summary of my reasons at the conclusion of the hearing on 14th November
    and these written reasons now follow.


DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of  law
and shall stand.
