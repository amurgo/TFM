Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Youssefian (for Wimbledon Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of Vivian [O], a citizen of  Nigeria,  born  24  May
    1999, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 23  July  2018
    dismissing her appeal, itself brought against the refusal of her  human
    rights claim of 3 October 2017.

 2. The Appellant was granted entry clearance to study  in  the  UK  on  17
    September 2016. Following her  arrival  she  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the basis of being the adopted child of a
    settled parent, her aunt [HE], a British citizen.  Her  aunt's  husband
    [OE] has leave to remain until 13 April 2019.

 3. The background facts to her adoption were based on  her  mother  ([SO])
    having had a severe stroke in 2005 meaning she could not move her right
    side, and her father being seriously injured in a car accident  leaving
    him with brain damage. They had been reduced to destitution  and  lived
    on the streets in rural towns near Benin City. She had younger siblings
    who she claimed were  cared  for  her  by  her  grandmother,  Victoria;
    however, Victoria did not have the capacity to care for  the  Appellant
    too. Victoria had helped with her daily care when she was younger.

 4. In the UK she lived with the Sponsor, Ms [E], whose maternal  aunt  was
    the Appellant's grandmother. Ms [E] had  adopted  the  Appellant  under
    Nigerian law. She had broken ties with her parents subsequently.

 5. Her application was refused because the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    satisfied that the adoption order was legally effective  as  only  [SO]
    was named therein as the adopting parent, the Appellant  was  now  aged
    over  18,  the  Sponsor  was  married  and  thus  did  not  have   sole
    responsibility for the Appellant's welfare, and there was  no  evidence
    that the adopting party had been assessed as eligible and  suitable  to
    adopt from overseas by an adoption  agency  in  the  UK.  Nor  did  the
    evidence satisfactorily demonstrate that there were no other  relatives
    to care for the Appellant.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal noted that  the  Sponsor  earned  over  �24,000
    annually, had paid off her  mortgage  on  her  home,  and  had  savings
    exceeding �21,000. The most  relevant  evidence  before  it  given  the
    disposition of the appeal was:

      a) Of the adoption:

           - An undated letter from the Appellant's parents  consenting  to
             the adoption, from  a  city  address  and  written  after  her
             arrival in the UK; and

           - An Order from the Magistrates Court in Nigeria of  26  October
             2016 recording a magistrate making an adoption  order  in  the
             Sponsor's favour.

      b) Of the Appellant's mother's health: a letter  from  the  management
         board of the Central Hospital, Benin City, of 24 August 2017,  from
         the principal medical officer, stated the  Appellant's  mother  was
         receiving physiotherapy and  incapable  of  performing  her  normal
         duties following a stroke in 2005.

 7. The Sponsor's witness  statement  set  out  that  she  visited  Nigeria
    regularly to check on the welfare of the Appellant's relatives. She had
    visited Victoria in 2015, discovering that Victoria would  contact  the
    Appellant's parents when that was necessary by tracking  them  down  on
    the  streets,  which  could  take  days.  The  Sponsor  had  made   the
    responsible decisions in the Appellant's life since she was aged around
    six years old, for  example  insisting  that  she  continued  with  her
    schooling when her parents wanted her to start work. The Appellant  had
    become withdrawn and depressed since the refusal.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept the historical facts advanced by
    the Appellant. The documents leading to the adoption order had not been
    produced. The Order did not mention  the  Appellant's  father  and  the
    supporting evidence underlying that application had not  been  produced
    to the First-tier Tribunal; the Appellant and Sponsor were  absent  (so
    thought the Judge below), though a probation officer was present.

 9. The medical evidence relating to the parents was of unknown provenance.
    The Sponsor could have found out more  about  the  family  problems  in
    Nigeria given her frequent visits there and it was  not  credible  that
    were things as bad as claimed that further  enquiries  would  not  have
    been made; accordingly her claim to have last had contact with them  in
    December 2017 was not believed.

10. There were thus no  serious  and  compelling  reasons  indicating  that
    exclusion  was  undesirable.  The  nearest  comparator  Rule  was  that
    addressing adult dependent relatives and the Appellant's case fell  far
    short of the care threshold therein. Given  her  credibility  findings,
    the Judge did not accept there was family life  between  the  Appellant
    and Sponsor. The Appellant had not lived in the UK  for  long  and  had
    done so over a period when her leave was precarious given she only held
    short-term student leave.

11. Grounds of appeal contended that

      a) A material error of fact had been committed given that the  records
         of the adoption hearing in  fact  included  information  which  the
         First-tier Tribunal seemed to have overlooked;

      b) It was not tenable to hold against the Appellant the fact that  the
         letter from her parents bore a city address given that  the  letter
         was undated;

      c) There had been no cross examination of the  Appellant  such  as  to
         make it clear the degree to which her evidence was in issue;

      d) The Appellant had not stated she had  last  had  contact  with  her
         parents in 2017, but  in  September  2016  and  evidence  had  been
         overlooked as to the steps she had taken to track down her  parents
         via enquiries of other relatives;

      e) The Judge had made findings without an evidential basis,  as  where
         he considered it unlikely the Appellant's  mother  would  still  be
         receiving treatment many years after her stroke;

      f) The existence of family life had been rejected without reference to
         the evidence regarding the Appellant's dependency on the Sponsor or
         the fact that the  latter  had  had  sole  responsibility  for  her
         upbringing for a significant period.

12. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 10 January 2019
    given the evidence indicating that the Appellant's mother may have been
    present at the adoption hearing.

13. Before me Mr Jarvis for the Secretary of State took a pragmatic stance,
    explaining that there were clearly difficulties with the  reasoning  of
    the First-tier Tribunal. Even aside from the question as to whether  or
    not a fair procedure was adopted, there was no clear  evidential  basis
    for the finding that the  Appellant's  account  was  undermined  by  an
    undated letter giving a city address, and it was wrong to speculate  as
    to the duration of medical treatment following a stroke. Mr  Youssefian
    stressed that these flaws were truly fundamental ones.

Findings and reasons

14. I accept that there were indeed material errors of law in the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal. It  is  useful  to  set  out  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules in order to put the human rights  claim  in  context.
    Although the  refusal  letter  cited  a  child  migration  route  under
    Appendix FM, that does not seem to be especially relevant,  given  that
    the Rules on adoption are so much more on point.

         "Requirements for indefinite leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
         as the adopted child of a parent or parents present and settled  in
         the United Kingdom

         311.     The requirements to be met in the case of a child  seeking
         indefinite leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  the  adopted
         child of a parent or parents present  and  settled  in  the  United
         Kingdom are that he:

         (i)      is seeking to remain with an adoptive parent or parents in
         one of the following circumstances:

             ...

             (c) one parent is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom
             and has had sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

             (d) one parent is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom
             and  there  are  serious  and  compelling  family   or   other
             considerations which make exclusion of the  child  undesirable
             and suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care;
             ... and

         (ii)     has limited  leave  to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom, and

             (a) is under the age of 18; or

             (b) if aged 18 or over, was given leave  to  enter  or  remain
             with a view to settlement under  paragraph  315  or  paragraph
             316B and has demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the  English
             language and sufficient knowledge about  life  in  the  United
             Kingdom in accordance with Appendix KoLL; and

         (iii)    is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried  and  is
         not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit;
         and

         (iv)     can, and will, be accommodated and  maintained  adequately
         without  recourse  to  public  funds  in  accommodation  which  the
         adoptive parent or parents own or occupy exclusively; and ...

         (vi)

             (a) was adopted in accordance with a  decision  taken  by  the
             competent administrative authority or court in his country  of
             origin or the country in which he is resident, being a country
             whose adoption orders are recognised by the United Kingdom; or



             (b) is the subject of a de facto adoption; and

         (vii)    was adopted at a time when:

             (a) both adoptive parents were resident together abroad; or

             (b) either or both adoptive parents were settled in the United
             Kingdom; and

         (viii)   has the same rights and obligations as any other child  of
         the adoptive parent's or parents' family; and

         (ix)     was adopted due to the inability of the original parent(s)
         or current carer(s) to care for him and there has  been  a  genuine
         transfer of parental responsibility to the adoptive parents; and

         (x)      has lost or broken his ties with his family of origin; and

         (xi)     was adopted, but the adoption is not  one  of  convenience
         arranged to facilitate his admission to or remaining in the  United
         Kingdom; and

         (xii)    does not fall for refusal under the  general  grounds  for
         refusal."

15. This was an appeal against  a  refusal  of  an  application  where  the
    Appellant was a minor when she applied for further leave  (on  3  April
    2017). The essential issue was whether the Appellant had a viable  case
    under these Immigration Rules, or outside them with respect to  Article
    8 ECHR.  If she had a viable case under the Rules, then so long as  she
    had established private and family life in the  UK,  her  appeal  would
    inevitably succeed: see TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India)  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    1109 �35. If her case failed under the Rules, then  the  public  policy
    judgments found within the Rules were likely  to  be  relevant  to  her
    appeal's prospects outside them. As stated in MM (Lebanon) [2017]  UKSC
    10, "although the tribunal must make its own judgment, it should attach
    considerable weight to judgments made by the Secretary of State in  the
    exercise of her constitutional responsibility for immigration  policy."
    Lord Carnwath in the Supreme Court makes the same point in Patel [2013]
    UKSC 72, stating at [55] that "the balance drawn by the  rules  may  be
    relevant to the consideration of proportionality".

16. The Appellant's claim was based on her aunt  having  long  exercised  a
    significant degree of responsibility over her  upbringing  due  to  her
    parents' lack of capacity to fulfil that role themselves. As of October
    2016, it was said that her aunt had formally  adopted  her.  The  Rules
    permit switching by a child applicant from limited leave to  indefinite
    leave to remain (there being no particular form of leave required found
    in Rule 311). So two central  questions  requiring  determination  were
    whether the Appellant enjoyed family life with her  aunt,  and  whether
    the adoption was a valid one. In both respects it seems to me that  the
    First-tier Tribunal fell into error.

17. The decision of the Strasbourg Court in Advic v UK (1995)  20  EHRR  CD
    125 is sometimes cited for the proposition that  the  normal  emotional
    ties between a parent and an adult son or daughter  will  not,  without
    more, suffice to constitute family life: Kugathas [2003] EWCA  Civ  31.
    Buxton LJ emphasised in MT (Zimbabwe) [2007] EWCA Civ 455 at [11]  that
    Advic, "whilst stressing the need for an element of dependency over and
    above the normal between that of a parent or parent  figure  and  adult
    child, also stresses that everything depends on  the  circumstances  of
    each case". The Upper Tribunal President wrote in Lama [2017]  UKUT  16
    (IAC) �32 that "at its heart, family life  denotes  real  or  committed
    personal support between or among  the  persons  concerned."  In  AA  v
    United Kingdom (Application no 8000/08; 20 September 2011) the European
    Court of Human Rights stated that:

         "An examination of the Court's case-law would tend to suggest  that
         the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old, who resides with  his
         mother and has not yet founded a family of his own, can be regarded
         as having 'family life'."

18. It is rather difficult to see how it is that Tribunal below found  that
    there was no relevant family life in play. The Appellant  was  a  minor
    child at the application date and she  was  solely  cared  for  by  the
    Sponsor and her husband.  Whilst it may be  true  that  the  in-country
    Immigration Rules do not provide for continued  treatment  of  a  child
    applicant as if they  were  a  minor  throughout  the  decision  making
    process, the entry clearance Rules do so, and in so  doing  demonstrate
    recognition by public policy that it is undesirable to  let  delays  in
    processing a child's claim undermine their application.

         "27.     An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the
         light of the circumstances existing at the time  of  the  decision,
         except that an applicant will not be  refused  an  entry  clearance
         where entry is  sought  in  one  of  the  categories  contained  in
         paragraphs 296-316 or paragraph  EC-C  of  Appendix  FM  solely  on
         account of his attaining the age of 18 years between receipt of his
         application and the date of the decision on it."

19. Rule 311(ii)(b) recognises the same policy consideration, which is  apt
    to bear in mind when considering the proportionality of an  immigration
    decision, particularly when considered in tandem with  the  recognition
    by the ECtHR in AA that a young person who has not left the family home
    may be regarded as enjoying family life with  their  cohabiting  family
    members.

20. Furthermore, the approach of the Tribunal below to  the  lawfulness  of
    the adoption proceedings is flawed by material errors. It is clear that
    the Appellant's mother and Sponsor were in fact named as present at the
    adoption hearing, and that the Order  addressed  the  transfer  of  all
    relevant legal responsibilities to the Sponsor. Conceivably  the  Judge
    was confused by the refusal letter,  which  repeatedly  referenced  the
    Appellant's natural mother [SO] as being the  adopting  party.  In  any
    event, the adoption order does not appear to be defective in the manner
    suggested by the First-tier Tribunal.

21. I accordingly find that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    legally flawed and the  matter  must  be  re-heard.  Given  all  issues
    require re-determination,  the  appropriate  forum  is  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

22. I should add that one consideration to which  no  overt  attention  was
    given  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  the  extent  to  which   the
    Appellant's application met the UK's legal regime on the recognition of
    overseas adoptions. The Upper  Tribunal  considered  the  issue  in  TY
    (Overseas Adoptions - Certificates  of  Eligibility)  [2018]  UKUT  197
    (IAC), usefully stating:

         "8.      Not all foreign adoptions are recognised,  that  is,  have
         legal effect in the United Kingdom.  Sections  66  and  67  of  the
         Adoption and Children Act 2002  and  sections  39  and  40  of  the
         Adoption and Children (Scotland)  Act  2007  define  the  adoptions
         treated in law  as  having  legal  effect  in  England,  Wales  and
         Scotland (termed in the Adoption and Children Act as  '  Chapter  4
         adoptions'). These include certain intercountry adoptions:

             (i) An adoption effected under the law of a  Hague  Convention
             country  outside  the  British  Islands,  and   certified   in
             pursuance  of  Article  23(1)  of  the  Convention  (a  "Hague
             Convention  adoption").  The   UK   incorporated   the   Hague
             Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of  Children  and  Co-
             operation in Respect of Intercountry  Adoption  into  domestic
             law by the operation of the  Adoption  (Intercountry  Aspects)
             Act 1999 Schedule 1  and  Adoptions  with  a  Foreign  Element
             (Scotland) Regulations 2009/SI 182 (Scottish SI).

             (ii)      An overseas adoption (as referred to in paragraph  5
             above) effected under the law of a country or territory listed
             in the Schedule  to  the  Adoption  (Recognition  of  Overseas
             Adoptions) Order 2013 from 3 January 2014 and to the  Adoption
             (Designation of Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973  for  adoptions
             made from 1 February 1973 to 2 January 2014. These state  that
             such adoptions must not be a Hague  Convention,  customary  or
             common law adoption. This change is the underlying  factor  in
             this appellant's appeal.

             (iii)     An adoption recognised by the  law  of  England  and
             Wales and effected under the law of  any  other  country.  The
             inherent jurisdiction invoked to recognise  foreign  adoptions
             is described in detail by Sir James Munby President  in  N  (A
             Child), Re [2016] EWHC 3085 (Fam). We only attempt a  summary:
             the adoptive parents must have been domiciled in  the  foreign
             country at the time of the foreign adoption;  the  child  must
             have been legally adopted in accordance with the  requirements
             of the foreign law; t he foreign adoption  must  in  substance
             have the same essential characteristics as an English adoption
             and there must be no reason  in  public  policy  for  refusing
             recognition."

23. Nigeria is not a Hague Convention country  and  nor  is  it  a  country
    listed in  the  schedule  to  the  Adoption  (Recognition  of  Overseas
    Adoptions) Order 2013. The latter difficulty represents  a  barrier  to
    Rule 311(vi) being satisfied. The Sponsor has not lived abroad  for  an
    extended period with the Appellant and  so  this  is  not  a  de  facto
    adoption.

24. Section  66  of  the  Adoption  and  Children  Act  2002  provides  for
    recognition of various kinds of adoption. Section 83  applies  where  a
    child is sought to be brought  into  the  UK  by  a  person  habitually
    resident in the British Islands under  an  external  adoption  effected
    within the  previous  12  months.  This  is  likely  to  be  the  legal
    foundation for the point taken in the refusal letter that  no  relevant
    adoption agency approval had been demonstrated. The  Adoption  Agencies
    Regulations 2005 require  the  involvement  of  a  relevant  agency  in
    section 83 cases. Indeed, as noted in TY at para 13:

         "The Act envisages its provisions being implemented by  Regulations
         which may require a person intending to bring, or to cause  another
         to bring, a child into the  United  Kingdom  (a)  to  apply  to  an
         adoption agency (including a Scottish or  Northern  Irish  adoption
         agency)  in  the  prescribed  manner  for  an  assessment  of   his
         suitability to adopt the child, and (b) to give the adoption agency
         any information it may require for the purpose of the assessment."

25. I note that the record of proceedings indicates  that  the  Appellant's
    advocate before the First-tier Tribunal submitted that the Sponsor  had
    indeed been assessed by Lambeth Council as a suitable adoptive  parent.
    So there may well have been an assessment compatible with the statutory
    regime.

26. As noted by the Advocate-General in SM v ECO  UK  (Case  C-129/18),  in
    Chbihi and Others v. Belgium (16 December 2014)  the  Strasbourg  Court
    (citing the judgment  given  in  Harroudj  v  France)  held  that  "the
    provisions of Article 8 do not guarantee the right to found a family or
    the right to adopt ... However, this does not rule out the  possibility
    that States parties to the Convention may nevertheless have, in certain
    circumstances, a  positive  obligation  to  enable  the  formation  and
    development of family ties". It added that "according to the principles
    that emerge from the case-law of the Court, where the  existence  of  a
    family tie with a child has been established, the  State  must  act  to
    enable that tie to be developed  and  to  create  legal  safeguards  to
    enable the child's integration in his family."

27. So as always, provisions of domestic law are not necessarily  the  last
    word in a case where family life is in play. There is a  theme  running
    across the Immigration Rules involving children which  provides  for  a
    parent (including an adoptive one)  to  sponsor  a  child's  entry  and
    residence in the UK where they have held sole responsibility  for  them
    or where there are  serious  and  compelling  reasons  rendering  their
    exclusion undesirable.

28. These issues were not discussed before me and so it is not  appropriate
    to do any more than draw attention to them. It will be for  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to determine the appeal in the light of these  principles
    and the facts as it finds them to be.

Decision

The appeal is allowed to  the  extent  it  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for re-hearing.
