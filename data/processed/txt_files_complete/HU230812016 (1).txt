                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Thailand. She came to the United
      Kingdom as a student on 23 January 2010 with leave until 20 July 2011.
      She made an in time application for further leave to remain, again as
      a student. This was granted until 24 September 2013. On 22 January
      2013 she made a further application for leave to remain as a student.
      This was granted, valid until 29 December 2014.

   2. She left the United Kingdom. She then was granted entry clearance as a
      fianc�, valid from 16 April 2016 until 16 October 2016. She was in a
      same-sex relationship with Ms [SH], a British national. Ms [H] is also
      originally from Thailand. She came here at the age of 11. They first
      met in 2012 and a relationship developed. They began living together
      in April 2016. They were married at Croydon Registry office on 9 July
      2016.

   3. On 20 September 2016 she applied for leave to remain on the basis of
      her marriage. The respondent accepted that she met the eligibility
      requirements of Appendix FM. However, the respondent found she did not
      meet the suitability requirements. This was on the basis she had
      engaged in personation in an earlier English language test.

   4. Reference was made to her application of 22rd January 2013 for leave
      to remain as a student. With that application she had submitted a
      certificate from Educational Testing Service (ETS) about her
      proficiency in English. This related to a test taken on 29 August 2012
      at Synergy Business College. However, her test results had since been
      cancelled on the basis they had been fraudulently obtained by the use
      of a proxy test taker. In light of her engaging in fraudulent
      behaviour her application was refused under paragraph 276D was
      reference to paragraph 322(2) of the immigration rules. Because of
      this conduct her presence in the United Kingdom was not considered
      conducive to the public good.

   5. The respondent had regard to EX1(b) and concluded that there were no
      insurmountable obstacles to family life with her partner continuing
      outside the United Kingdom. Regard was also had to the appellant's
      private life under paragraph 276 ADE. She had not been here the
      necessary time and the respondent did not see very significant
      obstacles to her reintegration into Thailand. No other basis was seen
      justifying the grant of leave.

   6. General grounds of appeal were lodged.

The First tier Tribunals

   7.  The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn
      at Taylor House on 26 January 2018.In a decision promulgated on 2
      March 2018 the appeal was allowed. At that hearing the respondent had
      produced the lookup tool and a report on Synergy Business College
      following a criminal enquiry known as Project Fa�ade. What have come
      to be known as `the generic statements were also produced. These set
      out the background to the widespread personation and the mechanisms
      used for checking.

   8. The appellant produced various certificates including confirmation
      that on 4 December 2014 she was awarded a Masters of Business
      Administration from the University of Wales. The appellant gave
      evidence about attending the test centre.

   9. Judge Flynn found her evidence to be credible. Whilst there was
      evidence of widespread cheating at Synergy Business College the judge
      found there was insufficient evidence to show the appellant used a
      proxy. The judge then went on to consider the other issues arising,
      which included reaching a finding of insurmountable obstacles to
      family life continuing elsewhere. The judge also found no adverse
      section 117 B factors arising.

  10. The respondent then applied for permission to appeal to the Upper
      Tribunal, arguing that the judge had failed to properly apply the
      correct burden and standard of proof in line with SM and Qadir [2016]
      EWCA 1167.Permission was granted on this basis. Following a hearing
      the respondent's appeal was allowed in the Upper Tribunal. The
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn was set aside and the
      appeal remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

  11. The de novo hearing then took place before First-tier Tribunal Judge
      Cohen at Taylor house on 4 April 2019.This time, in a decision
      promulgated on 26 April 2019, the appeal was dismissed. Mr Bazini
      appeared on behalf of the appellant, as he does now.

  12.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen was critical of the appellant's
      command of English at the hearing. The judge referred to the specific
      evidence about the college contained in the Project Fa�ade report. The
      judge found the appellant's explanation for picking the college and
      details of taking the exam vague and implausible. The appellant's
      evidence was that she had requested a copy of the speaking test but
      was unable to provide confirmation of this. Again the judge was
      critical of the appellant not producing evidence to show what attempt
      she had made to obtain the recording. The judge concluded that the
      respondent was entitled to dismiss the application on suitability
      grounds.

  13. The judge then went on to consider the other issues arising and
      concluded there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life
      continuing in Thailand. Similarly there were no significant obstacles
      for the appellant reintegrating into life in Thailand. No other
      features existed to justify allowing the appeal.

The Upper Tribunal

  14. Application was made for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,
      only this time by the appellant. Permission was granted on the basis
      it was arguable there was an insufficient foundation for the
      conclusion the appellant lacked credibility. Furthermore, the judge
      did not properly evaluate the evidence, including a failure to
      consider evidence of English proficiency submitted by way of
      certificates and qualifications. Reference was made to various
      certificates from 2010 and 2012. From 2012 to 2014 the appellant and
      studied for, and obtained, a Masters in Business Administration. It
      was arguable the judge failed to properly evaluate this evidence of
      her competency in English. It was also arguable that the judge
      attached excessive weight to the appellant's failure to obtain copies
      of the voice recordings.

  15. At hearing, Mr. Walker accepted that the grounds advanced demonstrated
      a material error of law. In particular, he said there was a failure by
      the judge to make a finding about the appellant's English in light of
      her ability to obtain a Masters Degree in Business Administration. The
      appellant's representative also referred to an email sent by the
      appellant to ETS for an explanation which was not forthcoming. The
      correspondence was contained in the appellant's bundle. He said that
      the appellant's attempts to resolve the matter had not been taken into
      account by the judge.

Consideration

  16. On the basis of the presenting officer accepting there is a material
      error of law in the decision, and having regard to the points arising
      and the content of that decision, it is my conclusion it cannot be
      sustained. Consequently, I set the decision aside on the basis there
      has been a material error of law in the evaluation of the evidence and
      remit the matter again to the First-tier Tribunal for remaking de
      novo.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen materially errs in law and
is set aside. The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a
rehearing.

Directions

   1.Relist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor house
   excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn and First-tier Tribunal Judge
   Cohen.


   2. An interpreter is not required, as advised by the appellant's
   representative.


   3. The hearing should not last more than two hours. The appellant's
   representative anticipated the appellant and one witness would give
   evidence.


   4. Whoever is deciding the appeal should bear in mind this is would now
   be the third hearing and seek to apply the guidance in SM and Qadir
   [2016] EWCA 1167. They should bear in mind that the legal burden remains
   throughout with the respondent. The generic statements; the look up tool
   and the investigation into the college have been used before to satisfy
   the evidential burden on the respondent to establish a question to be
   answered by the appellant. The appellant's explanation will need to be
   analysed. It would then be a matter of evaluating the totality of the
   evidence to see if the respondent has established on the balance
   probabilities personation. It will also be necessary to look at the wider
   article 8 issues arising.


   5. It is open to the appellant's representatives to update their appeal
   bundle to include the emails referred to enquiring about the voice
   recordings. They may wish to consider updating the evidence in relation
   to general family and private life. A skeleton argument from the
   appellant's representatives would be useful.
