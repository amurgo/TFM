Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr KJ Wood, instructed by Rochdale Law Centre
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Majid Ziroohi, date of birth 30.7.84, is  a  citizen  of
    Iran.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ennals promulgated 26.6.14, dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision  of  the  respondent,  dated19.4.14,  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection, and human rights claims and to remove him from
    the UK. The Judge heard the appeal on 9.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    14.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Ennals should be set aside.

 6. The appellant entered the UK as a visitor and made  a  late  claim  for
    asylum on the basis of alleged anti-regime  activities  being  revealed
    following the arrest of a friend. Judge Ennals dismissed the appeal  on
    all grounds, having found the appellant not credible.

 7. The grounds of appeal  argue  that  the  judge  did  not  consider  the
    totality of the evidence and  in  particular  failed  to  consider  the
    evidence of the appellant's dismissal from the doctor's surgery. It  is
    asserted that the judge had not considered the background evidence when
    assessing the appellant's account. Complaint  is  also  made  that  the
    judge refused to  allow  an  adjournment  to  adduce  evidence  of  the
    appellant's 2009 blog and screen prints.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Parkes simply  stated  that  he
    found the grounds arguable.

 9. The Rule 24 response submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
    directed himself appropriately and if there were any errors, they  were
    not material and thus not errors of law. In relation to the adjournment
    refusal, it is submitted that the judge was entitled to  consider  that
    as this was in  issue  from  the  outset,  the  appellant  should  have
    provided satisfactory evidence of his blog covering that  time  period.
    The further evidence now adduced was not before the First-tier Tribunal
    and should not be admitted at this stage.

10. The grounds rely on �21 of the decision to the  effect  that  the  only
    corroborative evidence of the arrest was a screen  print  from  another
    blog. It is submitted that at A18/19 of the  appellant's  bundle  there
    was a letter from Dr Shabestari terminating the appellant's  employment
    at the surgery, due to his anti-regime politics becoming known  to  the
    authorities. Mr McVeety accepted that the judge did  not  mention  this
    evidence, but he challenged the materiality.

11. The letter dated 1.2.11 is not verifiable; it  cannot  be  demonstrated
    that it was written by the doctor. The  appellant  entered  the  UK  on
    5.8.10 and this letter was not written until some 6 months later. There
    is no evidence that the appellant had been given leave of absence  from
    his employment or that he ever intended to return to Iran. His case  is
    that in December 2010 his father informed him of  his  friend's  arrest
    and that the appellant's family home had been raided and  his  computer
    and other items including anti-regime information were  taken.  He  was
    also informed that his blog had been blocked in Iran.  His  sister  had
    asked him to leave her home in the UK once his  visa  expired,  because
    she  didn't   want   problems   from   the   immigration   authorities.
    Notwithstanding these matters, the appellant did not claim asylum until
    December 2011,  well  over  a  year  after  he  claims  he  learnt  the
    authorities were interested in him.

12. It is not necessary to rehearse  all  the  credibility  findings  here.
    However, I might point out one or two pertinent examples. For instance,
    at �18 although the  appellant  said  that  he  was  a  songwriter  and
    producer of music on his computer, he said that  he  did  not  actually
    write the words, but contributed to revising them  to  better  fit  the
    music; yet he was unable to remember any  of  the  words  or  even  the
    titles of any of the songs. More significantly,  during  his  interview
    the appellant repeatedly stated that he had no problems in Iran  before
    he left. His witness statement sought to revise those  answers  by  the
    frankly ridiculous suggestion that he did not see his  claimed  arrest,
    detention and mistreatment over 12 days in January 2010 as  an  ongoing
    problem. Before the First-tier Tribunal in oral evidence  he  tried  to
    suggest that there had been a problem with the interpreter. That was in
    complete contrast, as the judge pointed out, to his  witness  statement
    adopted at the hearing which confirmed he had no difficulties with  the
    interpreter. It is clear  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found
    serious and irreconcilable credibility issues with  the  appellant  and
    his account.

13. In that context I do not accept  that  the  doctor's  letter,  even  if
    reliable, can have any material bearing on the outcome of the appeal. I
    find the letter not credible. In particular I find it not credible that
    the letter purports to terminate the appellant's employment, long after
    he had left Iran and apparently, in light of the  credibility  findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal, what can only be concluded to  be  with  no
    intention  to  return.  I  note  that  he  has  given   different   and
    inconsistent accounts of how long he intended to stay in the UK,  1,  4
    or 6 months. He has also said he intended to go to Canada and  that  he
    surrendered his passport to the  agent.  That  is  not  the  action  of
    someone who intended to return to Iran.  His  employment  would  surely
    have been terminated on his failure to turn up  for  work.  The  letter
    makes no reference to any leave of absence or that he  is  out  of  the
    country. Frankly, given the credibility findings in relation  to  other
    issues, I cannot see how it could be said that  consideration  of  this
    letter would or could have produced a different outcome to the  appeal.
    In the circumstances, I find no error of law in the  omission  of  this
    document from the judge's considerations.

14.  The  second  ground  of  appeal  refers  to  background  evidence,  in
    particular that detailing arrests and mistreatment following  the  June
    2009 presidential election, raids on homes and repressive treatment  of
    suspected anti-regime activists  by  the  Iranian  authorities.  It  is
    submitted that credibility findings were not made with reference to  or
    in context of the background evidence.

15. As Mr McVeety pointed out, there was no doubt that those  suspected  of
    anti-regime activity are persecuted by the  Iranian  authorities.  That
    was not in issue in the appeal. However, given the judge's  credibility
    findings, the appellant is not liable to such  persecution.  The  judge
    did not accept the factual basis of his account. He thus does not  fall
    to be considered or suspected as an anti-regime activist  or  otherwise
    at risk because of actual or imputed political opinion. The  background
    evidence does not assist the judge to assess the  appellant's  account.
    If, which the judge did not accept, his account were truthful, then  it
    is obvious that he would be at risk.

16. In the circumstances, I find  no  error  of  law  in  relation  to  the
    treatment or lack of treatment of the background evidence.

17. For the following reasons I find no error of law  in  relation  to  the
    documents produced regarding the appellant's website or  blog  and  the
    alleged error in failing to adjourn to allow  further  evidence  to  be
    produced, which is alleged to amount to procedural unfairness.

18. First, it is clear that the issue of the  existence  of  the  blog  was
    challenged by the respondent at �5 of  the  reasons  for  refusal.  The
    appellant supplied the web address but despite confirming that  it  was
    correct, the immigration officer could not find any  information  about
    the appellant. A further search was conducted after the  interview,  on
    28.5.12, but again without success. Thus the respondent did not  accept
    that the appellant had any anti-regime blog.

19. The letter at A8, dated 24.4.12, explains  that  following  the  asylum
    interview a number of documents were  submitted  to  the  Secretary  of
    State, including a copy of one page  of  the  appellant's  website  and
    confirmation that the website had been blocked in  Iran.  However,  the
    documents in the appellant's bundle were of very poor  quality  and  in
    particular in the judge's  copy  of  the  appellant's  bundle  the  web
    address is undecipherable. Mr Wood produced to me a  colour  copy  that
    was clear, but he could not explain why documents of that quality  were
    not supplied to the Tribunal. He tried to give evidence to me that  the
    clearer copies were available with the appellant's file and  that  they
    had been sent to the respondent. However, I was not prepared to  accept
    any evidence from Mr Wood on this matter.

20. It is said that A12 shows the web address at the top left, but I  could
    not make it out. It is said that A13 is a  translation  of  the  square
    blocked area of A12, but makes no reference to the appellant's name. At
    �19-�20 of the decision, the judge considered the evidence  before  him
    as to the blog. He noted that at A10/11 was dated  April  2012,  months
    after the asylum claim and some 18 months after he left Iran. There was
    no corroborative evidence for the existence  of  the  blog  before  the
    appellant left Iran, or even before his asylum claim.

21. It was at this point, part-way through the hearing of the appeal before
    the First-tier Tribunal, that Mr Wood sought an adjournment to  produce
    evidence of the earliest blog entries dating back to 2009.  He  claimed
    he had not been put on notice that it was to be contended that the blog
    had only recently been created in order to support the asylum claim.  I
    find that a disingenuous suggestion, given that it was obvious from the
    outset that the respondent did not accept that there was any such blog.
    The appellant  and  more  so  his  legal  representatives  should  have
    produced satisfactory evidence  of  the  blog.  There  had  been  ample
    opportunity to do so, not only of  earlier  blog  postings  but  better
    quality documents. Those put before the  Tribunal  were  of  such  poor
    quality that it was impossible to check the web address or  to  confirm
    that the appellant is even mentioned in the blocked page. The burden of
    proof was on the appellant, but it had not been discharged.

22. At �26 the judge again drew  attention  to  the  poor  quality  of  the
    document submitted on the appellant's behalf. The appellant  failed  to
    provide any contemporaneous evidence  of  his  blogging  activities  in
    Iran, even though,  if  it  existed,  such  evidence  would  have  been
    relatively easy to obtain and produce. However,  the  judge  considered
    that even if the appellant had blogged as claimed, the only  reason  he
    would have been at risk was after the arrest of  his  friend,  but  the
    evidence for that came from another anonymous blog. The judge therefore
    found that there was no objective evidence that  his  friend  had  been
    arrested, or that the appellant is  of  any  adverse  interest  to  the
    authorities in Iran, as explained in �26 of the decision. I  find  that
    these were all findings reasonably open to the judge  on  the  evidence
    and for which cogent reasons have been provided.

23. In the circumstances and on the limited evidence put before the  judge,
    I find that it was practically impossible for the  First-tier  Tribunal
    to have concluded that this was  the  appellant's  blog,  or  that  his
    blogging had come to the attention of the authorities. I  further  find
    that there was no error of law in proceeding with the appeal hearing on
    the evidence the appellant had chosen to put before  the  Tribunal.  Mr
    Wood accepted that this was not his strongest point.

24. The grounds assert that the respondent had the "original screen prints"
     relating the the Internet blog but chose not to provide  them  to  the
    Tribunal. Judge Ennals is crticised for not requesting the Home  Office
    to produce them. I find this a an unsustainable attack on both the Home
    Office and the Tribunal judge. There  remains  no  evidence  whatsoever
    that such original documents had been submitted. Nor was Mr  Wood  able
    to explain why further and at least as good copies were  not  submitted
    as part of the appellant's bundle or at the very least produced to  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Apparently, very recently, with the past week  the
    appellant's representatives had written to the  Home  Office  to  check
    what documents had been  submitted  following  the  appellant's  asylum
    interview. It having been left so late to make such an enquiry, it  had
    not been possible to locate the file. However, given that  the  refusal
    decision stated that no such  evidence  had  been  produced,  it  seems
    rather unlikely that there would  be  better  evidence  with  the  Home
    Office than the appellant's representatives produced to the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

25. No argument appears to have been advanced to the First-tier Tribunal as
    to the effect of any sur place activities by the appellant in  the  UK.
    It does not feature in the grounds of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal and was not addressed in the submissions  made  to  me.  In  the
    circumstances this is not an issue with which I need to deal.

Conclusion & Decision:

26. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
