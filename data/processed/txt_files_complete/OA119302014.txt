Representation

For the Appellant:     Sponsor in person
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


   1. The Appellant is a Moroccan  national.  On  22  August  2014  she  was
      refused entry  clearance  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
      Immigration Rules. The Respondent refused her application on financial
      grounds as her sponsor's gross income from State Pension was �6,456.48
      and consequently the income threshold of  �18,600  was  not  met.  The
      Appellant appealed against that decision and her appeal was  dismissed
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge C Burns in a decision promulgated  on  29
      June 2015. The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  against  that
      decision. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Bartlett
      on 7 September 2015 on the grounds that First-tier  tribunal  gave  no
      consideration to the best interests of the young children  as  against
      the children being in the United Kingdom and their mother remaining in
      Morocco. The First-tier Tribunal  judge  had  considered  whether  the
      Appellant's husband could not go to Morocco but gave no  consideration
      to the question of the best interests of the UK children being in  the
      UK without their  mother.  Judge  Bartlett,  in  granting  permission,
      considered that the failure to assess the best interests  against  the
      background of the UK citizen children being in the United Kingdom  and
      the mother remaining in Morocco constituted an arguable error of  law.



The Grounds

   2. The grounds for permission to appeal are dated 11 July 2015  and  rely
      on a letter from the sponsor's MP Henry Bellingham in which he  states
      that it would be unrealistic for the Appellant's children to  come  to
      the UK to start their schooling without their mother.




The Hearing

   3. As the sponsor was unrepresented I explained to him the nature  of  an
      error of law hearing. He relied on the letter  from  his  MP  and  the
      grant of permission.




   4. Mr Melvin submitted that the First-Tier Tribunal acted  appropriately.
      The Judge looked at the Rules and then found those Rules could not  be
      met. The Judge moved on to conduct staged Article  8  assessment.  The
      children were free to move to and from  Morocco  and  the  Judge  made
      findings on the best interests of the children that were open  to  her
      to make. The proportionality  assessment  was  open  to  her  and  not
      irrational. The sponsor was free to live in Morocco  should  he  wish.
      There were many examples of British Citizen children living abroad. It
      may be beneficial for them to be educated here but this did not  bring
      the determination into material error. The children's  best  interests
      were considered throughout and it was taken on board  that  they  were
      British Citizens. S55 of the Borders, and  Citizenship  Act  2009  had
      been applied. The argument was with the findings. The prior  residence
      of the sponsor in Morocco and the difficulties he may have  on  return
      to Morocco were considered. There was no breach of  the  Human  Rights
      Act for not granting leave outside the Rules as they  failed  to  meet
      requirements.




   5. The sponsor said that he had been to his local MP  who  had  supported
      him and was a barrister. He thought it was not realistic for him to go
      abroad. They were genuinely married for 7  years.  The  children  came
      along two years after they married. It was still  a  genuine  marriage
      and his children were suffering really  badly  with  their  education.
      Their medical expenses and everything in Morocco cost a lot. They were
      learning French and Arabic and she taught them English.  He  travelled
      in and out of Morocco and they lived here for two years and  when  the
      visit visa ran they were advised that she should go back. His wife had
      passed her English test, had her  own  national  insurance  number  he
      couldn't understand how someone could  be  legally  married  and  have
      British children and not be allowed to be here with family.  He  could
      not look after the children alone. They had to go to school here.  His
      wife would have to be here to look after the children and  he  was  72
      years old and could not be expected to run the children.  He  was  not
      asking the state to keep his wife and she was well and truly  educated
      enough. She spoke four languages.  It was hard for her having to  look
      after them. There was street fighting. His sister in  law  had  broken
      her arm protecting his children. If someone was British they should be
      allowed to be here.  She was here on a visa and did not overstay.




Discussion and Findings

   6. The First-tier Tribunal made the following findings. The  Judge  found
      that the Appellant did not meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration
      Rules as the sponsor had a state pension of �6,456.48 which  fell  far
      short of the Rules. She considered the case  outside  the  Rules.  She
      assessed the proportionality of the Respondent's decision,  addressing
      the  best  interests  of  the  children  as  a  primary  consideration
      (paragraph 26). She found it was in their best interests to live  with
      both parents.  She found that the sponsor could move back  to  Morocco
      where he had lived from 2008 to 2011 with the Appellant and their twin
      children who were born in 2010. In assessing the public interest,  she
      took account  of  all  the  relevant  factors  in  section  117B.  She
      considered, that in view of the fact that there was no  prospect  that
      the  Appellant  would  be  able  to  meet  the  requirements  of   the
      Immigration Rules due to the sponsor's  financial  circumstances  that
      the only prospect of the family being reunited was for the sponsor  to
      move to Morocco (paragraph 31). She then concluded that it would be in
      the children's best interests to return to the United Kingdom to start
      their schooling with their mother (paragraph  35),  all  things  being
      equal. However, she then concluded at paragraph 36,  that  all  things
      were not equal because the Appellant did not meet the requirements  of
      the Rules and there would be insufficient funds  to  ensure  that  the
      Appellant was financially independent. Further, the sponsor had  lived
      in Morocco recently for 3  years.  She  weighed  the  factors  in  the
      balance and concluded that the best interests  of  the  children  were
      outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect   of   the   all   the   other
      considerations (paragraph 37).




   7. I find that there is a material error of law in the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal. Whilst  the  Judge  is  clearly  aware  that  the
      Appellant's children are British Citizens, the First-tier Tribunal did
      not direct itself in accordance with ZH (Tanzania) (FC) (Appellant)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2011] UKSC  4
      as to  the  intrinsic  importance  of  citizenship,  namely  that  the
      children have rights which they will not be able to exercise  if  they
      live another country. Further, having found that the best interests of
      the children were to return to the UK  with  their  mother  and  start
      their schooling, the First-tier Tribunal did not consider whether  the
      exclusion of their mother would mean  that  they  were  constructively
      expelled from the European Union and unable to enjoy the substance  of
      their rights.




   8. In Campbell (exclusion; Zambrano) [2013] UKUT 147 (IAC)  the  Tribunal
      held that there is no  reason  in  principle  why  the  principles  in
      (Zambrano  v  Office  National  de  l'Emploi  C-34/09)   cannot   have
      application in entry clearance cases: in both in-country  and  out-of-
      country cases the Member State must ensure that any "refusal does  not
      lead, for the Union citizen concerned, to the denial  of  the  genuine
      enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by  virtue  of  his
      status  as  a  citizen  of  the  Union":  Dereci  &  Others  (European
      citizenship) [2011] EUECJ C-256/11, 15 November  2011,  paragraph  74.
      Non-EEA nationals acquire  rights  under  Article  20  TFEU  if  their
      expulsion from the territory  of  the  EU  would  have  the  necessary
      consequence that a dependent EU citizen child  would  be  required  to
      leave the territory - effectively, the constructive expulsion of an EU
      citizen child. McCarthy v. Secretary of State for the Home  Department
      (Case C-434/09, judgment of 5th May  2011)  established  that  nothing
      short of the constructive expulsion of the EU citizen will suffice and
      the rupture of family life will not engage Article 20 TFEU.




   9. The grounds as expressed in the letter of Mr Henry Bellingham MP argue
      that it would be unrealistic for the children to be educated in the UK
      without the Appellant residing with them. Permission  was  granted  on
      the basis that the  best  interests  of  the  children  had  not  been
      assessed against the background of the UK citizen  children  being  in
      the United Kingdom and the mother remaining in Morocco.  I  find  that
      the First-tier Tribunal's decision did not take  account  of  material
      factors arising out of the Appellant's children's British  Citizenship
      or consider the relevant case law set out above and that this amounted
      to a material error of law.





      Notice of Decision




  10. For the above reasons therefore I find that there was an error of  law
      in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.




  11. I set the decision aside.  Having  regard  to  Part  7.2  (a)  of  the
      Practice Statements for the Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tier Tribunal, the  extent  of  judicial
      fact finding is such that this matter should be remitted to the First-
      tier Tribunal for rehearing.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Whilst there  was  no  application  for  anonymity  as  there  are  children
involved I consider an order to be appropriate. Unless and until a  Tribunal
or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.   No  report
of these proceedings shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  him  or  any
member of his family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and  to
the Secretary of State.  Failure to comply with this  direction  could  lead
to contempt of court proceedings.
