                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The History of the Appeal

1.   The  Appellant,  was  born  on  3  March  1978  and  is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh.

2.   The Appellant entered the UK on 19 September 2009 with leave  to  enter
    as a student valid until 31 December 2012.  On  19  December  2012  she
    applied for leave to remain as the  spouse  of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the UK.  He was a  British  citizen.   Her  application  was
    refused on 18 July 2013.  Her ensuing appeal,  in  which  both  parties
    were represented, the Appellant by her present solicitors, was heard by
    Judge Afako sitting at Taylor House on 5 June 2014  and  allowed  under
    the Immigration Rules in a determination promulgated on 19  June  2014.
    Permission to appeal was granted to the Respondent on 19 August 2014 by
    Judge Ransley, essentially on the grounds discussed below.   Procedural
    directions were issued on 27 August 2014.

3.   The error of law hearing was listed for 8  October  2014  at  2pm.   By
    3.30pm, when I reached the appeal, there was no  appearance  by  or  on
    behalf of the Appellant.  A letter from her solicitors attached a  copy
    of their  email  request  of  29  August  2014  to  the  Appellant  for
    instructions and stated that they were without instructions.

4.   Notice having been given to the Appellant and  to  her  solicitors  and
    there being no explanation for the Appellant's  absence,  I  heard  the
    appeal in her absence.  It took the form of brief submissions  by  Miss
    Ong, which I have taken into account.  I reserved my determination.

Determination

5.   The Refusal Letter  is  a  necessarily  lengthy  excursus  through  the
    alphabetically coded provisions  of  Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration
    Rules.

6.   Section R-LTRP.1.1(d) provides that the requirements for limited  leave
    to remain in the UK as a partner include the applicant not falling  for
    refusal under Section  S-LTR:  suitability  for  leave  to  remain  and
    meeting the requirements of paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2-1.12 and 2.1.

7.   Section S-LTR.2.2 provides that, whether  or  not  to  the  applicant's
    knowledge,  in  relation  to   the   application   false   information,
    representation or documents have been submitted or  there  has  been  a
    failure to disclose material facts.  Judge Afako  found  that,  at  the
    date when the Appellant and the Sponsor went through a  civil  ceremony
    of marriage in the UK, the Sponsor  was  not  free  to  marry  because,
    although his first wife had been granted an Islamic divorce  from  him,
    she had not been granted a civil one.  In her application the Appellant
    had not stated that the Sponsor was not yet free to marry, so that  her
    application had to be regarded as that of  a  fianc�e,  not  a  spouse.
    Judge Afako found that she had acted in good faith.  However  this  was
    not to the point, because  her  failure  to  disclose  this  unarguably
    material fact in relation to the application  fell  for  refusal  under
    Section L-LTR.2.2 by reason  of  the  words  "Whether  or  not  to  the
    applicant's knowledge".  In finding at paragraph 9 of the determination
    that the refusal on suitability grounds under Section  S-LTR.2.2  could
    not be sustained because the Appellant was not  aware  that  there  was
    anything amiss with the Sponsor's status, the judge fell into error.

8.   Section R-LTRP also requires an applicant to meet the  requirements  of
    paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2-1.12 and 2.1.  Section E-LTRP.1.8 states that  if
    the applicant and partner are married or in a civil partnership it must
    be a valid marriage or civil partnership as specified.  At paragraph 11
    the judge concluded that the Appellant and her partner were not married
    and were no longer relying on that  relationship.   So  he  found  that
    Section E-LTRP.1.8 was not in point.  This finding was open to him.

9.   It followed, therefore, that  the  status  of  the  Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor  was  that  of  fianc�s.   The  judge  should  therefore   have
    considered paragraph E-LTRP.1.12, which requires that  the  applicant's
    partner cannot be the applicant's fianc�(e) unless  the  applicant  was
    granted entry clearance as that person's fianc�(e).  This was  not  the
    capacity in which the  Appellant  had  been  granted  entry  clearance.
    Paragraph E-LTRP.1.12 was therefore infringed.

10.  In the Refusal Letter the  Respondent  considered  paragraph  EX.1  and
    gave reasons why  it  was  not  applicable.   This  conclusion  is  not
    challenged.  Nor is the conclusion in the Refusal Letter that paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules, relating to private life, could not be
    satisfied.

11.  The judge erred in law, both  as  to  paragraph  S-LTR.2.2  and  as  to
    paragraph E-LTRP.1.12.  These errors were  material  to  the  decision.
    The determination cannot stand, and I set it aside.

12.  Making the decision again,  it  follows  from  my  reasoning  that  the
    appeal must fail.  For those reasons I dismiss it.

13.  I preserve the anonymity direction made by Judge Afako.

Decision

14.  The original decision contained an error of law and is set aside.

15.  The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.
