For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis , Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Iqbal. A Seelhoff Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The First-tier Tribunal (FtT) did not make an anonymity direction. We
    have not been asked to make one and see no public policy reason for
    doing so and none is made.

2.    This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    (hereafter "the respondent") against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) (Judge O'Garro). On 2nd April 2015 the FtT  allowed  the
    appeal of Mr Enekwe (hereafter "the claimant"), a citizen  of  Nigeria,
    against the decision of the respondent dated 20th August 2014  refusing
    his application for leave to remain as a partner pursuant  to  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules. The respondent refused the application  on
    the basis that the claimant  was  not  able  to  demonstrate  that  the
    financial requirements  of  the  Rules  were  met  on  the  basis  that
    specified documents had not been  produced  that  met  fully  with  the
    prescriptive requirements of Appendix FM-SE of the Rules.

3.    The FtT noted there was no dispute the claimant had two jobs and  that
    specified documents had been provided in respect of his employment  for
    "Serenity Care Ltd" from January to March 2014. There  was  no  dispute
    and, it was accepted, that the claimant's earnings from this employment
    was �953.19. The FtT went on to consider the evidence of the claimant's
    earnings from his second employment with Marianne Pilkington. The judge
    referred to the nature of the evidence the  claimant  was  required  to
    submit in order to meet the prescriptive requirements of Appendix FM-SE
    of the Rules. She observed that the net income shown on the wage  slips
    which covered the period from  27th  January  2014  to  2nd  June  2014
    correlated with payments credited to the claimant's  bank  account  and
    noted the employer's letter in which it was stated the claimant's gross
    earnings from this employment totalled �9,120.50.

4.    The judge considered and attached weight to a letter  issued  by  HMRC
    of 17th February 2015 and earlier letters dated 22nd  August  2014  and
    22nd October 2014 respectively, post the  date  of  application,  which
    confirmed the claimant's gross earnings from January to June  2014  was
    indeed �9,120.50. In view of that evidence the judge concluded that she
    had "no option" but  to  accept  the  claimant's  earnings  during  his
    employment with Ms Pilkington was �9,120.50. The judge found that  when
    these earnings were added to the  accepted  earnings  of  �953.19,  the
    claimant's total gross  earnings  amounted  to  �10,073.69.  The  judge
    calculated with reference to paragraphs 13(b) and 15 of Appendix  FM-SE
    that the claimant's gross income was  therefore  �20,147.38.  Thus  she
    found the claimant was able to  demonstrate  that  he  met  the  income
    threshold under Appendix FM of the Rules. Accordingly, the  appeal  was
    allowed under the Immigration Rules.

5.    The respondent lodged an application for permission to appeal  arguing
    that the judge erred in law in that her calculation of  the  claimant's
    income was based on earnings from employment that had  ended  prior  to
    the date of application of 19th July 2014 and, there was no evidence of
    current employment as of that date. Further, it was contended that  the
    wording of paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE required the claimant or  his
    partner  to  be  in  current  employment  or  otherwise  self-employed.
    Permission to appeal was granted by FtT Judge Brunnen on 4th June  2015
    on the basis that it was arguable that earnings  from  past  employment
    could not satisfy this requirement.

6.    We noted the narrow issue raised by this appeal and that our task  was
    to  decide  whether  the  FtT  erred  in  its  consideration   of   the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE and whether the evidence before the  FtT
    demonstrated the claimant was in employment at the date of application.
    In this regard we observed that it was not easy for us to discern  what
    evidence was put before the FtT but, the evidence now produced  in  the
    form of a letter issued by HMRC of 17th February 2015, we  accept,  did
    show that the claimant had  been  employed  by  HRGO  Plc  since  2013.
    Nevertheless, we observed that this did not avail the claimant  as  the
    absence of evidence of wage slips or an  employment  letter  from  HRGO
    excluded him from meeting the exacting requirements of the Rules.

7.    In amplifying the grounds before  us  Mr  Jarvis  submitted  that  the
    judge's calculation of the claimant's gross annual income was wrong. He
    referred to paragraph 15(b)(i) of Appendix FM-SE and submitted that the
    judge was required to consider gross annual earnings over a  period  of
    twelve months and not six months. He referred to three entries  in  the
    schedule submitted by the claimant's representative which helpfully set
    out the claimant's income received in the twelve-month period prior  to
    the date of  application  which  indicated  his  income  was  over  the
    required threshold. He said however that it was not clear whether gross
    or net figures had been relied on in respect of three  entries  and  he
    referred to income received from HRGO Plc on  20th  December  2013  and
    Serenity Health  Care  on  14th  February  2014  and  14th  March  2014
    respectively. He noted, in any event, that  there  was  an  absence  of
    specified evidence in the form payslips and  an  employment  letter  in
    respect of these entries.

8.    We acceded at this stage to the request  of  the  representatives  for
    time to consider  the  schedule  in  order  to  ascertain  whether  the
    requirements of the Rules were met. Upon resumption of the  hearing  Mr
    Jarvis agreed that the  evidence  established  that  the  claimant  was
    employed at the date of application and the  parties  agreed  that  the
    evidence thus far established in the manner  prescribed  by  the  Rules
    that the claimant's  gross  annual  earnings  totalled  �18,113.04.  Mr
    Jarvis conceded that the refusal letter had confused  matters  in  that
    consideration  was  given  to  a  six  month  period  rather  than  the
    applicable twelve month period prior to the  date  of  application.  He
    further acknowledged that  the  respondent  had  failed  to  apply  the
    discretion  conferred  by  Appendix  FM-SE  in  circumstances  where  a
    specified document had not been  produced.  He  acknowledged  that  the
    claimant's bank statements  showed  monies  being  deposited  into  his
    account that related to his income, and that the respondent would  have
    due regard to that evidence. Mr Jarvis thus  conceded  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law and invited us to allow the appeal on the basis
    that the respondent's decision was not in accordance with the  law.  Ms
    Iqbal did not dissent from such a course.

9.    We announced at the hearing that we were satisfied the  FtT  erred  in
    law for the reasons given by Mr Jarvis. We accept that the claimant had
    provided some evidence that he was employed at the date of  application
    but not all of the required specified evidence was provided  with  that
    application. Had it been so  the  schedule  of  the  claimant's  income
    appears to establish that his gross annual income was in excess of  the
    income threshold for a  twelve  month  period  prior  to  the  date  of
    application. We agree with Mr Jarvis that  in  such  circumstances  the
    Rules permit the exercise of discretion which  in  this  case  was  not
    considered.

10.   For the above reasons we conclude that the FtT Judge materially  erred
    in law and her decision is set aside.

11.   We remake the decision and  find  that  the  respondent's  failure  to
    consider her discretion as conferred by  the  Rules  was  unlawful.  We
    observe that it is accepted by  both  parties  that  the  shortfall  in
    income is relatively small, and that, as one of his previous employers,
    Serenity Care Ltd has been dissolved it may not therefore  be  possible
    to obtain documents issued by them.

12.    The  effect  of  this  decision  is  that  the  respondent  must  now
    reconsider the claimant's application which remains outstanding on  the
    concessions made before us and our findings. The respondent  must  take
    into account the schedule of the claimant's earnings  annexed  to  this
    decision and is to apply her own guidance as set out in Appendix FM-SE;
    look at the evidence as a whole and apply the 'evidential  flexibility'
    procedure built in to that appendix at paragraph D in  accordance  with
    the Rules applicable at the date of application.

Decision:

13.   The making of the decision of the FtT did involve  the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law. We set aside the decision and  substitute  our
    decision allowing the  appeal  to  the  extent  that  the  respondent's
    decision is not in  accordance  with  the  law.  The  application  thus
    remains before the respondent awaiting a fresh, lawful  decision.  This
    disposes of the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal.
