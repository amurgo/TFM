Representation:

For the Appellant:          Mr Singh of Birmingham Law Practice Limited

For the Respondent:       Mrs Aboni Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Shergill ('the Judge') promulgated on 14 October 2016 in which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
        refusal to grant  him  international  protection  and/or  leave  to
        remain on human rights grounds.
     2. The appellant is a national of Iran who claimed asylum  based  upon
        an alleged genuine conversion to Christianity.
     3. The Judge considered the evidence from all  sources  and  sets  out
        findings of fact from [16] of the decision under challenge.
     4. The appellant stated he attended the Oasis Church and, by the  date
        of his asylum interview, had been baptised.  The  Judge  thereafter
        sets out a number of findings which are specifically challenged  by
        Mr Singh.
     5. These include:


         19.  I have carefully read the  interview  and  note  that  it  was
             conducted some months  after  the  appellant  arrived  in  the
             United Kingdom. He had in those months started  attending  the
             'Oasis Church' and by the date of interview had been  baptised
             there. I later heard that the appellant would  have  undergone
             some pre-baptism classes there.


        20.  It is unsurprising therefore that the appellant  was  able  to
             give an account of certain aspects of Christianity by the time
             of interview.


        21.  I was somewhat  sceptical  about  the  appellant's  relatively
             recent conversion in Iran and then what appears to have been a
             period of time before being interviewed during which he  could
             have, in effect,  perfected  his  claim  here  in  the  United
             Kingdom. That was certainly my concern from the papers.


        22.   I  had  previously  heard  the  case  involving   a   similar
             background; represented by the same solicitors on 9  September
             2016.  Indeed,  it  was  the  same  representative  and   same
             witnesses from the Oasis Church. There was a sense of d�j�  vu
             but of course in fairness to  the  appellant  I  put  material
             matters to him/Mr Johnson to deal with.


        23.  As  I  was  aware  of  certain  matters  relating  to  Iranian
             Christians in Birmingham, I  asked  the  appellant  about  the
             Church of Light/Noor Church which is the Iranian Church in the
             city. That was because through judicial notice,  I  was  aware
             that they have a six-month wait time in place before baptising
             people to avoid people abusing  the  process.  The  series  of
             questions is reproduced below:


                    "Have you heard of the Noor Church  in  Birmingham?  Not
                    heard of it; I have heard about it but  not  been;  been
                    going to Oasis.


                    How did you hear about Oasis? When I was in  the  hostel
                    the people there got the address and went to Oasis.


         Were they Iranians Christians as well? Y


                    Did they not mention the Church of Light in  Birmingham?
                    No not mentioned anything to me.


         Just Oasis that you go to? Yes; Oasis in Birmingham


                    I have heard the Noor Church has a six-month  wait  time
                    before baptising is that  anything  you  heard  of?  Not
                    anything about this matter but when I went to the church
                    and going regularly; the priest registered us Rob; after
                    10 Nov went and few months and was called for baptism."


        24.  There was a change of heart as to whether  the  appellant  had
             heard about the church or not; and I was not persuaded by  his
             responses.  I  do  not  consider  that  his   fellow   Iranian
             Christians that he knows would  not  have  mentioned  anything
             about it. I was dubious as  to  the  appellant's  motives  for
             'airbrushing' his evidence to me about this.


     6. Mr Singh submitted that [21] suggested a procedural  unfairness  as
        the Judge had clearly made his mind up about how he  was  going  to
        determine the appeal before hearing evidence from the appellant.
     7. Such an assertion has no arguable merit. A  Judge  is  entitled  to
        form a preliminary view of the merits of the  case  from  the  pre-
        hearing reading, provided the judge does not thereafter shut his or
        her mind to the  evidence  as  a  whole,  to  the  extent  that  an
        appellant does not receive a fair hearing. See  AM  (fair  hearing)
        Sudan [2015] UKUT 00656 (IAC) in which it was found that judges are
        entitled to form provisional views in advance of a hearing provided
        that an open mind is conscientiously maintained.
     8. Mr Singh also submitted that the reference in  [22]  supported  the
        argument of procedural unfairness as it was not right for the Judge
        to determine the merits of the case by reference to a previous case
        or another church in which the appellant had no knowledge.
     9. The Judge was not entitled to determine the merits  of  the  appeal
        based upon evidence that had not been brought to the  attention  of
        the parties and in relation to which they had  not  been  given  an
        opportunity to comment. It cannot  be  said  that  the  appellant's
        legal team were unaware of the matters referred to in  [22]  as  Mr
        Singh confirmed that he was the representative who appeared  before
        the Judge in the case on 9 September  2016  and  that  the  Judge's
        recollections in relation to that previous matter are accurate.
    10. At [23] the Judge clearly asked questions of  the  appellant  about
        the Church of Light to enable the appellant  to  comment  upon  any
        knowledge he had of that church. The fact the appellant was  unable
        to comment, combined with the fact  Mr  Singh  was  aware  of  that
        evidence through previous litigation, supports a  finding  that  in
        relation to this aspect  there  has  been  no  arguable  procedural
        unfairness. In AM (fair hearing) Sudan [2015] UKUT 00656  (IAC)  it
        was held that if a judge  is  cognisant  of  something  conceivably
        material which does not form part of either party's case, this must
        be brought to the attention of the parties at the earliest possible
        stage. This is what the Judge did.
    11. The Judge sets out at [25] the reason he wanted to find out if  the
        appellant had been to the Church of Light, as in  the  Judges  view
        they will be best placed to assess the genuineness of his claim  in
        accordance with their understanding of the particular circumstances
        in Iran. At [26] - [31] the Judge finds:


        26.  The best evidence would have been from the Church of Light  in
             terms of them having been satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
             received instruction and was a genuine believer. In my view it
             would have been difficult  for  the  respondent  to  disregard
             cogent and reliable evidence from a Minister from  an  Iranian
             church; as such a person would be best placed to speak of  the
             customs and circumstances'. That is particularly so given  the
             wait time operated by them before baptising  people  to  avoid
             abuse and the inherent risk of fabricated claims.


        27.  On the opposite end of  the  scale,  the  Oasis  Church  being
             willing to baptise much earlier  and  with  a  seemingly  less
             stringent approach  to  filtering  would-be  converts  was  of
             concern to me. It has the potential  to  be  abused  by  those
             wishing to fabricate evidence of conversion, a general concern
             which has long been recognised by this jurisdiction  (see  for
             example the  IAT  case  of  Dorodian  v  SSHD  dated  23/08/01
             (CO/16974/00)).


        28.  I have evidence from  Oasis  Church  before  me.  I  note  the
             photographic evidence purports to  show  the  appellant  being
             baptised. The copy I have is poor but out of fairness to  him,
             I accept  it  shows  what  is  claimed  i.e.  the  appellant's
             baptism. There is also a baptism certificate. For the  reasons
             set out below, I will consider these pieces  of  evidence  'in
             the round' as I am not satisfied they are conclusive in  their
             own right.


        29.  I have no issue with the benevolence of the pastor or  witness
             from Oasis Church. I am sure they are genuine and kind-hearted
             people doing their best to 'spread the word'.  In  particular,
             I do not attach the significance  that  Ms  Pearson  did  that
             somehow they are campaigning  advocates  for  asylum  seekers.
             However, I note  that  they  are  non-Farsi  speakers  (I  had
             previously been told the church relies  on  interpreters)  and
             from  a  religious  persuasion  that  wants  to  convert   and
             evangelise. In those circumstances,  I  cannot  rule  out  the
             potential for new 'converts' being able to take  advantage  of
             the goodwill of the church. In my view, the  witness  evidence
             relied on will be from no better position to  assess  'customs
             and circumstances' about an appellant's background than anyone
             else, including myself.  That  is  particularly  so  given  Mr
             Johnston's relatively recent interaction  with  the  appellant
             and the broad statement in Mr Hooper's letter.


        30.  I accept Mr  Johnston  'genuinely  believes'  the  appellant's
             account and that he "firmly believe[s] what [he is] telling me
             is the truth and significant obstacles  involved  in  arriving
             here and trauma leaving his family and child; central  aspects
             of his testimony were true". I  also  note  that  Mr  Johnston
             would not attend for everyone. However, the  time  period  and
             circumstances under which he has assessed  the  appellant  are
             not particularly significant in my view.  There  is  also  the
             issue about  Rev  Hooper  having  written  in  terms  that  Mr
             Johnston was unable to comment on and the lack of recording of
             attendances etc.


        31.  For all these reasons, the evidence from Oasis Church  is  not
             sufficiently persuasive on its own and I will assess it in the
             round with the other evidence.


    12. What these findings show is that the  Judge  does  not  decide  the
        weight he is willing to place upon the evidence from  Oasis  Church
        solely by reference to the Church of Light, although the  practices
        of the Church of Light were clearly found  by  the  Judge  to  give
        weight to a claim by a member or representative of that church that
        a person who may have baptised is a genuine convert, i.e. a  person
        who wishes to convert from their  previous  religion  to  become  a
        follower of the Christian faith. Those comments therefore relate to
        observations about  the  quality  of  the  evidence  that  will  be
        received from the Church of Light.
    13. The Judge noted the Oasis Church were willing  to  baptise  earlier
        and with a less stringent approach to filtering  would-be  converts
        which is arguably good reason for why the Judge did not  place  the
        weight upon the evidence from the Oasis Church that  the  appellant
        is suggesting he should  have,  such  as  to  find  that  that  was
        determinative of not only the  fact  of  conversion  but  also  the
        appellant's motives.
    14. The Judge clearly considered the evidence  from  the  Oasis  Church
        with the required degree of anxious scrutiny and has given adequate
        reasons for the findings made. As such the weight to  be  given  to
        that evidence was a matter for the Judge. No legal  error  material
        to the decision to dismiss the appeal is made out  in  relation  to
        the approach of the Judge to the evidence from the Oasis Church.
    15. The Judge thereafter went on to assess the  appellant's  conversion
        at [32] - [45].
    16. Mr Singh in his submissions attacked the Judge in relation  to  the
        finding at [44] where the Judge records the following:


        44.  When assessing all of the evidence in the round at  the  lower
             standard, I am not persuaded that the appellant has  genuinely
             converted to Christianity. Furthermore,  I  am  not  persuaded
             that he has genuinely been evangelising. I am not persuaded at
             the lower  standard  that  he  is  a  Christian  or  would  be
             perceived to be a Christian based on his claimed  evangelising
             activity in the United Kingdom.

    17. It  was  submitted  by  Mr  Singh  that  the  Judges  reference  to
        'considering all the evidence  in  the  round'  would  include  the
        evidence relating to the Church of Light and  the  deficiencies  he
        argued existed in  relation  to  that  material  which,  therefore,
        impacted upon the overall assessment. The problem for the appellant
        is, as stated above, that no arguable legal error has been made out
        in relation to the way the Judge dealt with  the  Church  of  Light
        issue or assessed the weight he was willing to give to the evidence
        from the Oasis Church. It is also  the  case  that  the  Judge  was
        required to assess all the evidence 'in the round' for a failure to
        do so may well amount to arguable legal error.
    18. The Judge sets out several concerns that he had in relation to  the
        evidence of the appellant which led to the finding  the  Judge  was
        not satisfied the appellant had shown to the lower standard that he
        was a genuine convert before he came to the United  Kingdom,  based
        on discrepancies and non-persuasive interview answers  said  to  be
        detailed in paragraphs 15 to 32 of the Refusal Letter.
    19. The Judge noted the appellant was unable  to  answer  basic  issues
        arising in Christianity in the interview and at [33]  -  [43]  sets
        out several factors which it was found undermined  the  appellant's
        claim to be a genuine Christian convert. This includes at [42] when
        the Judge  asked  a  hypothetical  question  of  the  appellant  in
        relation to what he would say if he stopped the Judge to evangelise
        and what he would tell the Judge to convince him  to  come  to  his
        church, the full response to which is recorded  in  the  record  of
        proceedings, it is noted that the appellant did  not  once  mention
        Jesus Christ, God or any real religious element. The Judge in  fact
        describes the response as "a lacklustre attempt at  conveying  what
        should be a heartfelt motivation for conversion and evangelising".
    20. Mr Singh was invited to make further  submissions  in  relation  to
        these previous paragraphs, the content of  which  would  have  been
        considered 'in the round' within  the  assessment  referred  to  at
        [44], but no adverse submissions were made and the findings set out
        by the Judge appear to be in accordance with the evidence  provided
        and fully available on the facts.
    21. The Judge accepted the appellant had been  through  a  ceremony  of
        baptism but did not find that he did so as a result  of  a  genuine
        desire to follow the Christian faith. Hence it  was  not  made  out
        that the appellant would act in a manner  on  return  to  Iran,  by
        evangelising, such that would give rise to a real risk.
    22. The appellant raised a  sur  place  issue,  claiming  that  he  had
        carried out activities in the United Kingdom  and  posted  them  on
        Facebook  himself.  If  those  activities  relate  to  church-based
        activities, the finding by the Judge  that  he  is  not  a  genuine
        convert means that those activities do not demonstrate or represent
        a fundamentally held belief which it will be unlawful to expect him
        to remove from his Facebook pursuant to the  principle  established
        in HJ (Iran). There is no evidence such entries have  come  to  the
        attention of the Iranian authorities or any evidence  that  if  the
        appellant provided the password that  enabled  the  authorities  to
        access his Facebook account if  questioned  on  return,  that  they
        would be able to discover any deleted evidence.
    23. The conclusion by the  Judge  that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
        discharge the burden of proof upon him to the required standard  to
        show a reasonable degree of likelihood of a  well-founded  fear  of
        persecution for a Convention reason has not  been  shown  to  be  a
        decision infected by a material error of law. The same  applies  to
        the dismissal of the appeal on human rights grounds.
    24. No procedural unfairness  is  made  out  sufficient  to  support  a
        finding the appellant did not receive a  fair  hearing  before  the
        Judge.
    25. The appellant shall be returned to Iran as no more  than  a  failed
        asylum seeker.


Decision

    26. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    27. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


        I make such order pursuant to rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
