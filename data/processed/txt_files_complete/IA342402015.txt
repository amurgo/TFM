                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and the background

1.   The appellant appeals to the Upper  Tribunal  with  the  permission  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins, who considered that there were  at  least
    arguable grounds for considering that First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bowler
    (the Immigration Judge) erred by  deciding  that  the  appellant  could
    continue to provide for his children by removing them  from  school  in
    the Philippines and educating them in Albania.  In Judge Perkins' view,
    there was no evidence to support such finding  or  reason  to  say  the
    appellant  should  have  produced  evidence  to   contradict   such   a
    proposition.  Those grounds  were  thought  to  be  arguable  by  Judge
    Perkins on 11 September 2017.

2    By way of background the appellant, an Albanian  national  born  on  18
    August 1986, entered the UK in 2010. He subsequently formed  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship  with  Ms  Baybay,  a  British  citizen  of
    Philippino background.  Ms Baybay has two children in  the  Philippines
    who are looked after by relatives there and she  sends  money  back  to
    them on a regular basis.  There does not seem to be any dispute  as  to
    the genuine and subsisting  relationship  between  Ms  Baybay  and  the
    appellant, nor does there seem to be any  dispute  as  to  Ms  Baybay's
    employment in the UK as a nanny. She  is  said  to  earn  approximately
    �20,000  per  annum  net  of  tax  and  national  insurance  from  that
    employment.

3.   On 27 January 2017 the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision to refuse the application for further leave  to  remain  under
    Appendix FM came before the Immigration Judge.  The  Immigration  Judge
    gave a lengthy and detailed decision in which she concluded that  there
    was no evidence as to the appellant's siblings' qualifications or  work
    experience.  Ms Baybay had longstanding work experience as a  well-paid
    nanny in the UK.  Having come to the UK herself in 1995 to  look  after
    children of a Qatari family she continued to look after the children of
    the family ever  since.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  that  the
    employment details had been correctly given.  Unfortunately, Ms  Baybay
    did not speak or read Albanian and it  was  thought  that  neither  the
    appellant or Ms Baybay had undertaken any research to find out how easy
    it would be for a nanny with Ms Baybay's experience  to  find  work  in
    Albania or what salary such a person could expect  to  achieve.   Given
    the lack of evidence that the  Immigration  Judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant  had  not  shown  to  what  extent  Ms  Baybay   would   face
    insurmountable obstacles in Albania in earning sufficient money to look
    after her children.  The original refusal had said very similar  things
    in the final paragraph of the refusal dated 9 November 2015, where  the
    respondent had explained that she considered that the  appellant  would
    be able to retain contact with  his  partner  by  modern  communication
    means if it was decided  they  were  to  live  in  separate  countries.
    Alternatively,  the  respondent  considered  that  the  partner   could
    relocate as a family unit.  The Secretary of State  was  not  satisfied
    that sufficient evidence had been provided to support  the  claim  that
    leave to remain should  be  given  on  an  exceptional  basis  because,
    effectively, of the economic disparity between the UK and Albania.

The Upper Tribunal hearing

4.    Mr  Nathan,  who  represents  the  appellant,  has  submitted  on  the
    appellant's behalf that the error was a "glaring  one",  in  the  sense
    that the sponsor who was giving evidence was not cross-examined because
    the respondent was not represented at the First-tier Tribunal.  It  was
    obvious, said Mr Nathan, that there was a  massive  economic  disparity
    between the UK and Albania.  The arrangement was slightly  unusual,  in
    that the sponsor obviously paid for the children  out  of  her  income.
    That income would be lost if she had to go and live  in  Albania  where
    average incomes would be significantly lower.   The  evidence  from  Ms
    Baybay was not contradicted in any way by anything said or done by  the
    respondent and contrary to paragraphs 25 and 26 of the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal oral evidence had been given and it was not correct
    to say there was no evidence because there was oral  evidence  and  the
    Immigration Judge could have asked  any  questions  that  she  desired.
    However, Mr Nathan acknowledged that there was nothing as far as he was
    aware to prevent an application being made under  the  Rules  but  both
    parties agreed that this was not a matter before me because what I  was
    concerned about is whether there were insurmountable  obstacles  within
    the terms of Appendix FM to EX2 of the Immigration Rules.

5.   The respondent submitted by way of response that the error in  approach
    by the Immigration Judge was not made out and she was entitled to  look
    critically at the evidence that had been produced and the question  was
    not one of possibility or impossibility. The question was whether there
    were insurmountable obstacles and whether this had been  shown  on  the
    facts of the case.  The Immigration Judge properly summarised what  had
    been argued in paragraphs 25 to 27 of her decision and it was  open  to
    the appellant's representatives to produce subjective evidence but they
    have not done so.  The burden being on  the  appellant,  the  appellant
    simply had not satisfied the First-tier Tribunal  that  there  were  in
    fact insurmountable obstacles to removal in this case.

6.    Mr  Nathan  responded  to  say  that  the  grounds  were  clear.    Mr
    O'Callaghan who had settled the grounds had set out exactly why he said
    there was substantial economic disparity between the two countries.  He
    explained that the present  employment  with  the  employers  in  north
    London was stable employment and the sponsor did  have  "some  sort  of
    pension" attached to it although the details are a bit "sketchy".   She
    earnt approximately �340 per month at the time and, no such  employment
    would possibly be available in Albania.

Discussion

7.   It is incumbent upon the appellant to show that there  was  a  material
    error of law such as would fall  within  Sections  11  and  12  of  the
    Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.  The parties  were  directed
    on 11 September 2011 by Judge Dawson that any  application  to  produce
    fresh evidence to be made  no  later  than  pointing  out  that  if  no
    application was made within the time set, i.e. no less than ten working
    days before the hearing. No explanation was given as to why evidence of
    Ms Baybay's prospects of obtaining employment in Albania had  not  been
    produced before the First-tier Tribunal, where both parties were  given
    an opportunity to produce such evidence. The appellant  is  represented
    by a reputable firm of solicitors who would be fully appraised  of  the
    requirements of the rules.  The Upper Tribunal would therefore have  to
    decide the case based on the evidence that was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

8.   I have to consider whether the Immigration Judge had been  correct,  in
    paragraph 25 of her decision, to put the burden on  the  appellant  and
    his witnesses to produce evidence  that  Ms  Baybay  could  not  obtain
    employment in Albania. Since the burden rested on the appellant to show
    that there were insurmountable obstacles to the appellant's integration
    into the country to which he would be sent if he was to succeed in  his
    appeal, it seemed to  me  that  the  burden  did  indeed  rest  on  the
    appellant to produce this evidence.  It was not for the  respondent  to
    show this and therefore it was  incumbent  on  the  appellant  and  his
    representatives to produce that evidence.

Conclusion

9.   I have concluded  that  although  there  is  clearly  substance  in  Mr
    Nathan's submissions, I do not agree with them.  The  Upper  Tribunal's
    function is to determine whether there is a material error  of  law  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  This decision appears to have
    been thorough and careful and it does not contain any  material  error.
    It was reached following a review of the authorities.  The  Immigration
    Judge clearly had the  legal  framework  in  mind  when  she  made  her
    decision. I do not consider in the  circumstances  that  there  is  any
    basis  for  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  interfere  with  that   decision.
    Accordingly, I have decided that the appeal against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal must be dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  dismissed.
Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier tribunal to dismiss  the  appeal
on human rights grounds stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
