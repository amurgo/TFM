For the Appellant:     Mr A A Shittu
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Nigerian citizen who was born on  25  January  1984.
    She submitted an  application  as  a  highly  skilled  worker  and  for
    permission to remain in the United Kingdom to finish  her  contract  of
    employment outside the Rules.  Her application was refused on  16  July
    2013.  She appealed the  decision  alleging  that  the  respondent  had
    failed to consider whether the appellant  "has  right  to  private  and
    family life in the United Kingdom" which ought to have been  considered
    without the  appellant  expressly  raising  the  same.   The  appellant
    alleged that she has been dating her fiancï¿½ for years,  he  is  in  the
    United Kingdom, and they are in the process  of  marrying  each  other.
    "The appellant has schooled and worked in the United Kingdom;  and  has
    made a lot of friends through in the process for  the  purpose  of  her
    private life.  (Sic)".

 2. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  noted  that  at  the  beginning  of  the
    hearing before her it was confirmed that the  appellant  conceded  that
    she  was  unable  to  meet  the  Immigration  Rules  regarding   spouse
    applications or the Article 8 criteria under the Rules.   It  was  also
    conceded that the Section 47 notice had been  properly  served  on  the
    appellant and this was not challenged.  The judge also  commented  that
    this was a poorly prepared appeal with the appellant claiming that  she
    has a right to remain in the United Kingdom  due  to  her  relationship
    with her partner who she claims is a British citizen.  The  judge  then
    went on to say that  no  evidence  of  the  partner's  citizenship  was
    submitted in copy or original format.  In particular he failed to bring
    his passport to the hearing with him. The judge concluded that  as  the
    partner's citizenship is unknown it is difficult to see how the refusal
    decision and Section 47 decision  breaches  her  Article  8  rights  in
    regards to family life.

 3. The grounds seeking permission to appeal the decision  state  that  the
    judge apparently failed to notice that a copy of the partner's  British
    passport was contained in the appellant's bundle at document number 15,
    which was before the judge. I am satisfied that there were certain copy
    passport entries in the appellant's bundle which had been sent  by  fax
    to the tribunal and  which  bundle  had  been  received  prior  to  the
    hearing.

 4. If the judge had relied on that sole matter to dismiss the  appeal  she
    would have erred materially.  However, in the very  next  paragraph  of
    the determination at paragraph 10 she states that even if she  accepted
    that the  appellant's  partner  is  British  there  was  missing  basic
    evidence to show that the relationship was  in  existence,  other  than
    mere assertion by the parties.

 5. The judge then went on  to  reason  why  she  did  not  find  that  the
    appellant had been in a relationship with her partner since 2011.   The
    photographs produced only showed recent  photographs  from  a  birthday
    party in 2014.  The appellant's friend who gave evidence  both  written
    and oral contradicted other evidence that had been provided  such  that
    the judge found her "an unconvincing and confused witness".  The  judge
    also  found  that  the  parties  had  insufficient  funds  to  maintain
    themselves or meet the Immigration Rules criteria and  that  Article  8
    should not be used to  sidestep  the  Rules.   Although  the  appellant
    states that she has been in a long-term relationship since 2011 she was
    not persuaded that this was anything other than a  more  recent  event;
    not least because the appellant failed to make any  reference  to  this
    aspect in her application form, even taking into account that  she  had
    no legal advice at that point.  The judge commented that the  appellant
    is an educated and well qualified woman.  She found that the  appellant
    has had a job in  the  United  Kingdom  since  2009  and  has  obtained
    qualifications during her time here.

 6. The grounds seeking permission to appeal submitted that the  judge  had
    not properly considered the Article 8 rights of the appellant's partner
    who was in court and who has stated that he will  be  affected  by  the
    decision to remove the appellant from  the  UK.   However,  considering
    that the judge was not persuaded that this was anything  other  than  a
    fairly new relationship, and taking into account all that she found  in
    paragraphs 23 and 24 of the decision it is unsurprising that the  judge
    dismissed this appeal.

 7. In all the circumstances and as I announced at the hearing there is  no
    material error displayed by the judge and in  those  circumstances  the
    decision of the judge that this appeal is dismissed is upheld.

 8. I was not addressed on the matter of anonymity.  The  circumstances  of
    this appeal do not suggest that anonymity  should  be  directed  and  I
    therefore do not do so.
