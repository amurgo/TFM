Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Lyndsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Ostadsaffar, Counsel, instructed by Lisa's Law
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. No anonymity order is made.

 2. The respondent in these proceedings was the appellant before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  From hereon I have referred to the parties as they were
    in the First-tier Tribunal so  that,  for  example,  reference  to  the
    respondent is a reference to the Entry Clearance Officer.

 3. The appellant is a national of China.  The appellant entered the United
    Kingdom on January 27, 2010 with valid leave to enter. That  leave  was
    subsequently extended until October 22, 2015.

 4. On October 24, 2012 the appellant married the sponsor and  was  granted
    leave to remain as a spouse until November 9, 2016.

 5. On October 15, 2016 the appellant applied for settlement on  the  basis
    her sponsor had obtained British citizenship  and  their  two  children
    (aged 3 and 1ï¿½ years of age) were also British citizens.

 6. The respondent refused her application in a decision dated January  10,
    2017 as he concluded the appellant had previously used a proxy taker to
    take an exam.

 7. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  His appeal  came  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Herbert OBE (hereinafter  called  "the
    Judge") on March 23, 2018 and in a decision promulgated  on  March  28,
    2018 the Judge allowed her appeal on  the  basis  article  8  ECHR  was
    engaged and that requiring the appellant and  sponsor  to  relocate  to
    China would amount to a disproportionate interference in the  sponsor's
    family and  private  life  which  outweighed  the  public  interest  in
    removal. Significant weight was attached to the fact  the  sponsor  and
    two children were British citizens.

 8. The respondent appealed this decision on April 6, 2018. The  respondent
    argued that the Judge's decision  was  flawed  because  the  Judge  had
    attached no weight to the deception and simply allowed the appeal based
    on the fact the  appellant  had  a  British  husband  and  two  British
    children and case law suggested only one outcome.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Hollingsworth on July 12, 2018 as he found it arguable  the  Judge  had
    given inadequate reasons for allowing the appeal.

    SUBMISSIONS


10. Mr Lyndsay referred to the grounds of appeal and submitted that any
    allegation of deception was serious and there were concerns in the way
    the Judge dealt with the issue. By adopting a stance that the appellant
    would win regardless of the deception the Judge erred by failing to
    conduct a full balancing act and the final outcome was unsafe because
    the Judge failed to give any weight to the public interest.


11. Ms Ostadsaffar submitted there was no material error. She submitted
    that whilst the decision was brief the Judge was clearly aware of the
    deception but ultimately concluded that having regard to section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act and the best interests of the children the
    appeal should be allowed. Section 117B(6) specifically states that
    public interest does not require the person's removal where the
    appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a
    child and it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave.

12. Mr Lyndsay accepted the respondent's policy was based on MA (Pakistan)
    and Others v Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chambers) and
    Anor (2016) EWCA Civ 705 but he maintained the Judge had failed to
    carry out proper balancing act and this amounted to an error in law.

    FINDINGS

13. The appellant had sought leave to remain in this country  as  a  spouse
    and  mother.  The  respondent  accepted  the  appellant  satisfied  the
    eligibility requirements of section R-LTRP and section EX.1 of Appendix
    FM but refused the application under section S-LTR 1.6 of  Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules.

14. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal and the Judge who  heard
    the appeal was sufficiently concerned about the  deception  to  make  a
    specific reference to it in paragraph 7 of the decision. The Judge  was
    clearly aware of the deception as he outlined the issue in paragraph  6
    of the aforementioned decision.

15. The Judge reminded himself about section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act  which
    makes it clear the public interest does not require a person's  removal
    where the appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
    with the child and it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to
    leave.

16. The Judge went on to consider proportionality and noted that  both  the
    children's  father  and  the  appellant  were  of  Chinese  origin  but
    acknowledged the father  had  obtained  British  citizenship  and  more
    importantly both children were British citizens. The Judge clearly  had
    regard to section 117B factors.

17. The criticism brought  by  Mr  Lyndsay  today  is  that  the  Judge  in
    paragraph 9 should have balanced the deception  alongside  these  other
    factors. Whilst there may be some merit to that argument this was not a
    case where the Judge was either unaware or oblivious to the  deception.
    The Judge felt somewhat restricted  by  case  law  which  followed  the
    decision in MA (Pakistan) and the respondent's own policy  reissued  in
    February 2018 reiterated that it would be the  exception  that  British
    children would be required to leave the United  Kingdom.  Circumstances
    that could lead to it being reasonable included where the appellant has
    committed significant or persistent criminal offences falling below the
    thresholds for deportation set out in paragraph 398 of the  Immigration
    Rules or has a very poor immigration  history,  having  repeatedly  and
    deliberately breached the Immigration Rules.

18. Taking into account the ages of the children, the  youngest  being  one
    year of age, and the fact that they are British  I  am  satisfied  that
    firstly, the Judge had had regard to the deception  and  secondly,  had
    concluded that the deception was insufficient to go behind  the  stance
    adopted in current case  law  and  repeated  in  the  respondent's  own
    guidance.

19. In the circumstances, the  decision  addressed  the  issues  and  I  am
    satisfied that the outcome would have been no  different  even  if  the
    Judge had specifically mentioned the deception in paragraph  9  of  his
    decision.

    DECISION

20. The appeal is dismissed and I uphold the original decision.
