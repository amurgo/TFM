Representation:
For the claimant: Mr S Subramaniam
For the appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Limberg Hugo Rojas Guzman, date of birth  18.2.82,  is  a
    citizen of Bolivia.

 2. The Secretary of State appealed against the determination of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Bircher, who allowed the claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 19.3.14, to  refuse  his  application
    made on 12.10.13 for an EEA residence card as confirmation of  a  right
    to reside in the UK as the spouse of an EEA national exercising  Treaty
    rights.  The Judge heard the appeal on the papers on 30.5.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Peart  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.8.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  I found that there was an error of law and set the  decision
    aside, adjourning the remaking of the appellant to  a  further  hearing
    before me in the Upper Tribunal, which resulted in  the  hearing  being
    listed before me on 28.11.14.

 5. In summary in relation to error of law,  I  found  that  Judge  Bircher
    failed to address the crucial issue in the appeal as  to  whether  this
    was a marriage of convenience and  failed  to  make  a  finding  as  to
    whether the Secretary of State had discharged the burden to demonstrate
    reasonable suspicion that it was a marriage of  convenience  so  as  to
    place the burden on the claimant  to  show  that  it  was  not  such  a
    marriage of convenience, as established in the  relevant  case  law  of
    Papajorgji [2012] UKUT 38 (IAC), where the Upper Tribunal held that (i)
    There is no burden at the outset of an application  on  a  claimant  to
    demonstrate  that  a  marriage  to  an  EEA  national  is  not  one  of
    convenience; (ii) IS (marriages of convenience) Serbia [2008] UKAIT  31
    establishes only that there is an evidential burden on the claimant  to
    address evidence justifying reasonable suspicion that the  marriage  is
    entered into for the predominant purpose of securing residence rights.

 6. Further, the judge failed to make  any  findings  in  relation  to  the
    claims of inconsistency between the appellant and his EEA sponsor.

 7. The judge also erred in finding that she  could  not  accept  that  the
    interview was properly and fairly conducted without a  full  transcript
    of that interview, which had not been provided. There was no reason why
    the judge should have doubted the interview summary  submitted  by  the
    Secretary of State. It was a matter for the claimant as to  whether  he
    wished to adduce evidence that the interview  was  somehow  unfair.  No
    such evidence had been produced and the claimant asked for  the  appeal
    to be decided on the papers without an oral hearing.

 8. I had intended to proceed immediately  to  remake  the  appeal  at  the
    hearing on 27.8.14, but Mr Guzman had asked for a Spanish  interpreter,
    which was not provided, and it was clear from that and earlier hearings
    that his command of English was less than fluent. In the  circumstances
    I adjourned the remaking of the decision in  the  appeal,  reserved  to
    myself, inviting the claimant to consider whether he  would  be  better
    advised to obtain legal representation, which he has done.

 9. I should add for clarity that there was a CMR hearing on 29.9.14 and an
    earlier listing of the continuation  hearing  on  30.10.14  had  to  be
    adjourned as Mr Subramanian had an accident on the way to the hearing.

10. At the outset of the hearing before me, Mr Subramanian said that he had
    not seen a copy of the interview summary, which was rather  surprising.
    However, a copy was provided for him.

11. At the end of the hearing on 28.11.14 I reserved  my  decision  on  the
    remaking of the appeal, which I now give.

12. Of some relevance to the issues in the appeal, and in particular to the
    interview  summary,  is  the  case  of  Miah   (interview's   comments:
    disclosure: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00515 (IAC) in  which  the  President
    held, inter alia, that Form ICV.4605 must be disclosed as a  matter  of
    course. That is the interview summary which was present in  the  papers
    before Judge Bircher and which at some stage  the  claimant  must  have
    seen, but Mr Subramanian now has had the opportunity  to  consider.  In
    that case, reliance was placed on comments in the interview which  were
    adverse to the subject's case and conveyed to the  decision  maker  but
    withheld from the subject. The president held that it would  be  unfair
    not to disclose it. There were no  comments  on  the  record  that  are
    relevant to  the  present  case;  but  the  content  of  the  interview
    disclosed discrepancies between the accounts of the  claimant  and  the
    EEA sponsor.

13. Without setting them out in detail, the interview summary highlights  a
    number of inconsistencies. Some of these are insignificant  but  others
    are not. For example,  the  sponsor  said  that  she  and  her  husband
    attended church quite a number of times, but he said that  neither  she
    nor he attended church. They gave differing accounts about each other's
    interest in football and the teams they support. He  said  he  used  to
    have a Manchester United scarf but lost it a long time  ago.  She  said
    she saw it that day hanging on the back of the wardrobe door.  Although
    she worked 3 jobs whilst he worked intermittently as a gardener, he was
    adamant that they struggled financially. He said  they  didn't  receive
    any type of financial assistance or support, but she disclosed that her
    mother gave her money which she saved up and put into  the  bank,  some
    ï¿½3,600. Other answers were no so much inconsistent as  designed  to  be
    deliberately vague in an apparent effort to  avoid  contradicting  each
    other. For example, asked when he first told his wife he loved her,  he
    said he had told her so on many occasions  from  the  day  after  their
    first date. She said she didn't think he had ever said it at all  since
    they met, as he was shy.  Other  examples  are  cited  in  the  refusal
    decision of 19.3.14.

14. In the circumstances, I find that there is ample material to  discharge
    the burden on the Secretary of State to raise  a  reasonable  suspicion
    that the marriage is one of convenience,  placing  the  burden  on  the
    claimant to demonstrate that it is not a marriage  of  convenience  for
    the predominant purpose of securing residence rights.

15. The claimant's witness statement of 28.11.14, as well as the letter  of
    complaint of 1.4.14, claim that he felt harassed at  the  date  of  the
    interview and under a lot of pressure. He said he felt uneasy  and  did
    not feel confident to be able to  answer  clearly  and  had  to  answer
    quickly. Whilst this, together with  the  difficulty  of  understanding
    English might well explain some of the differences between  the  couple
    that might be  regarded  as  vague  or  trivial,  but  it  provides  no
    satisfactory explanation as to why directly inconsistent  answers  were
    given of two mutually exclusive versions of certain  facts  or  events;
    they cannot live  in  the  same  world  and  cannot  be  attributed  to
    nervousness or the like. In the circumstances,  there  remains  serious
    doubt as to whether this is a genuine marriage.

16. Before the application was made, the claimant was in the  UK  illegally
    for some 9 years. He told me that he did not leave because he liked the
    country and got used to it. He worked illegally. He was unable to  tell
    me when he told his wife that he did not have status in the  UK.  Asked
    why the application was made in 2013,  he  said  that  they  wanted  to
    travel outside the UK, so that they could meet each other's families.

17. The claimant's spouse gave evidence, relying  on  her  undated  witness
    statement, which mainly deals with the interview  and  the  stress  and
    depression resulting from the unresolved immigration status. Asked what
    her plans for Christmas were, she said she was going  to  go  to  Spain
    with her sister. When he gave evidence he said they would  be  spending
    Christmas at home. I find it difficult to understand why he  would  not
    know that if their relationship were genuine.

18.  Mr  Jonathan  Bull  gave  evidence  relying  on  his  undated  witness
    statement. He has known the claimant a long time, some 10 years, and is
    in fact his landlord. Significantly, he was able to tell me that he had
    known the sponsor over the past two years and  to  his  knowledge  they
    live together in the flat he rents to them.  He  wasn't  aware  of  the
    claimant's immigration status and never thought to ask about it. He not
    only sees the couple as their landlord, but  sees  them  on  occasional
    weekends. Asked in  cross-examination  whether  he  could  say  if  the
    marriage was genuine, he pointed out that he was at the wedding, as  is
    clear from the photographs in the claimant's bundle.  He  continues  to
    see them on an irregular basis, irregular because  of  his  night  time
    work as a driver.

19. A less impressive witness was Mr Osman Balderrama, a fellow  countryman
    of the claimant. He has known him for some 6 years and is also  friends
    with the sponsor. They have been at parties and dinners together and he
    said that he had seen them in  a  romantic  relationship  during  those
    times. Mr Balderrama was in the UK 8 years illegally until he  obtained
    an EEA residence card last year. Given that,  I  take  Mr  Balderrama's
    evidence with caution, he, like the claimant, had a vested interest  in
    trying to show EEA residence card entitlement.

20. Unlike Judge Bircher, I have had the opportunity to see and speak  with
    the claimant and his wife during a number of hearings, in most of which
    he was not represented. At each hearing I have seen him with  his  wife
    and watched their interaction. At the latest hearing  I  also  had  the
    advantage of hearing oral evidence from not only the claimant  and  his
    spouse, but other witnesses who have known the  couple  for  some  time
    now. My observations tend to suggest to me that their's  is  a  genuine
    relationship and adds to the credibility of the claimant's case.

21. I remind myself that the burden is on the claimant  to  demonstrate  on
    the balance  of  probabilities  that  their  marriage  is  not  one  of
    convenience. Whilst I have significant concerns about  their  interview
    and some further discrepancies in  oral  evidence,  I  find  the  other
    witness evidence, in particular that of Mr  Bull,  compelling.  He  has
    seen the two of them over a lengthy period of time not only  living  at
    the same address, but on social occasions. He was even present  at  the
    wedding.

22. The net result of these considerations, which is in reality a balancing
    exercise between the evidence for and  against  the  claimant,  I  have
    concluded that he has demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that
    whatever it may have started out as, this is now, at the  time  I  must
    assess it, a genuine and subsisting marriage which is not a marriage of
    convenience. It follows, there being no issue as to whether the sponsor
    is qualified as exercising Treaty rights in line with regulation  6  of
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, as amended,  I  find  that  the
    claimant is entitled to the residence card requested.



Conclusion & Decision:

23. For the reasons set out above, I  find  that  the  claimant  meets  the
    requirements of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, as amended, for
    the issue of an EEA Residence Card on the basis that he is  the  family
    member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the UK.

24. The appeal of the claimant is allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: Whilst the appeal has been  allowed,  the  responsibility  for  the
refusal of the application was that of the claimant by  failing  to  provide
adequate evidence to address the issues in the refusal decision.
