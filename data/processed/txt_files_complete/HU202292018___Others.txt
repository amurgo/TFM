                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Background

The appellants are citizens of India, being father, mother, daughter and
son. They were born on 20 May 1980, 16 July 1981, 28 November 2007 and 10
January 2014, respectively. The second appellant was granted leave to come
to the UK as a student with leave from 10 October 2009 until 28 January
2011, arriving on 10 November 2009 with the other appellants having had
leave as dependants.

On 25 January 2007 applications were made by the first and second
appellants for leave to remain as parents under Appendix FM of the
Immigration Rules ("the Rules"), with the application subsequently being
varied on 29 May 2018 to an application for leave to remain on the basis of
family life as partners and as parents, and also in terms of private life.
That application was refused in a decision dated 19 September 2018.  The
appellants appealed against that decision and their appeal came before
First-tier Tribunal Judge Easterman at a hearing on 1 August 2019, whereby
the appeal of each appellant was dismissed.

    Judge Easterman's decision

Judge Easterman set out the legislative framework within which his decision
was to be based and referred in detail to the evidence and arguments before
him.  Similarly, he undertook a detailed assessment of the circumstances of
each of the appellants, including in his decision an analysis of the expert
evidence that was put before him.

He recognised that the essence of the appeals centred on the question of
whether it was reasonable for GS to leave the UK and to return to India.
Thus, at [65] he said this:

"... in reality all four appellants' cases turn on whether it is reasonable
for [GS] to be expected to return to her home country."

He concluded that it was reasonable to expect her to do so. The grounds of
appeal, in summary, complain that that assessment was flawed in terms of a
failure to take into account relevant Home Office guidance and relevant
caselaw.  It is further argued that the decision is flawed for a failure to
make specific findings in relation to GS's particular circumstances and a
failure to undertake a proportionality assessment.  It is also contended
that the decision fails to take into account psychiatric evidence in
relation to the first and second appellants which was contrary to his
conclusion at [62] that both of them are fit and healthy adults.  That, it
is argued, affected the assessment of whether there were very significant
obstacles to their integration in India.

Judge Easterman made detailed findings of fact.  He found that GS came to
the UK when she was about 1ï¿½ years of age and then returned to India for a
year or so before returning to the UK, where she has stayed ever since.  It
was not disputed that at the time of the application she had been in the UK
for seven years and one day and such was accepted in the respondent's
decision.

He noted that she was in year 6 at the date of the hearing and the evidence
was that she was doing well at school.  He referred to a handwritten letter
from her and a lengthy social worker's report written by a chartered
psychologist which was a report in relation to all of the appellants.
Judge Easterman gave a comprehensive summary of that report.  The report
included information about the relationships that GS had developed in the
UK in various respects.  Having assessed the report, however, Judge
Easterman found that it was not "entirely unbiased", appearing to have been
written solely from the point of view that both children should not go to
India.  He also expressed the view that the author of the report had simply
taken the evidence of the parents (at face value), but who plainly have an
interest in (obtaining) a report that suggests that the best interests of
the children are to remain in the UK.

Again, in relation to GS, he said that she is beginning to make her own
circle of friends and her own private life and that the most important part
of her life is her life with her family.  He found that there was about to
be disruption in her school life in any event because of moving schools and
he found that her and her brother's best interests are to remain with their
parents.

He then made a number of findings in relation to the first and second
appellants, including in terms of their health, noting that they both
suffer from depression.

At [64] he noted that GS does not meet paragraph 276ADE(iv) of the Rules
unless it was unreasonable for her to return to her home country.  He
referred at [66] to the decisions of KO (Nigeria) and Others v Secretary of
State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 and JG (s 117B(6): "reasonable
to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 00072 (IAC), going on to state that GS is
about to move schools and that notwithstanding what are suggested as
"possibilities" in the report to which he referred, her best interests are
to remain with her parents and they have no basis of stay in the UK unless
it was unreasonable to expect GS to leave.

At [67] he said this:

"I do not find it is unreasonable to expect GS to leave and accompany her
parents to their home country.  As a result, I find that none of the
appellants in fact meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE, or Appendix
FM and as a result, they have no basis to remain in the United Kingdom.  I
discussed with Ms Malhotra whether there was any purpose in reviewing the
matter separately under Article 8 outside the Rules but it seems to me that
there are no additional features of this case that require that or that
would bring about a different decision.  As a result I am satisfied that
any interference with any of the appellants' private life pursues a
legitimate aim namely the maintenance of effective immigration control, is
in accordance with the law and is proportionate and reasonable and as they
would be removed as a family there is no interference with family life at
all."

Assessment

I can express my conclusions shortly in the light of the position adopted
on behalf of the respondent before me.  It was conceded on behalf of the
respondent that Judge Easterman's decision must be set aside for error of
law. That is because the conclusion that it would be reasonable to expect
GS to leave the UK failed to have regard to what was said in MA (Pakistan)
& Ors, R (on the application of) v Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum
Chamber) & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705, in particular at [49], in terms of the
starting point in relation to a child who has been in the UK for seven
years being that leave should be granted (to a parent) unless there are
"powerful reasons" to the contrary.  It was accepted that on the basis of
the evidence before Judge Easterman it could not lawfully be concluded that
it would be reasonable to expect her to return to India.

I agree with that concession and would add that the reasoning in MA
(Pakistan) in that respect was applied by the Upper Tribunal in MT and ET
(child's best interests; ex tempore pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 00088 (IAC).

At [49] of MA (Pakistan) the Court said as follows:

"...  However, the fact that the child has been in the UK for seven years
would need to be given significant weight in the proportionality exercise
for two related reasons: first, because of its relevance to determining the
nature and strength of the child's best interests; and second, because it
establishes as a starting point that leave should be granted unless there
are powerful reasons to the contrary."

It must be acknowledged that Judge Easterman did refer to relevant
authority, in particular citing KO (Nigeria), and he plainly had in mind
the 'real world' scenario of the first and second appellants having no
lawful basis of stay in the UK (on their own account). However, the error
of law arises in the terms explained above and which the decision in KO
(Nigeria) does not negate.

It is not necessary for me to express a concluded view about whether Judge
Easterman also erred in law at [62] of his decision in stating that both
the first and second appellants are fit and healthy adults, in
circumstances where there was psychiatric evidence that they both had
mental health problems, suffering from depression.  Judge Easterman in fact
made reference to that evidence on more than one occasion in his summary of
the evidence and his conclusions elsewhere, for example at [49] and [60]
and it could be said, therefore, that he had that evidence in mind in his
analysis overall.

As regards the error of law in terms of the assessment of the
reasonableness of GS returning to India, as conceded by the respondent the
decision does need to be set aside and I do so. It was also conceded on
behalf of the respondent that the appropriate course was for the decision
on the appeal of each appellant to be re-made, allowing the appeal of each
appellant.  I agree, for the reasons explained above.

    Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on
a point of law.  Its decision is set aside in respect of each appellant and
I re-make the decision allowing the appeal of each appellant on Article 8
grounds.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
