                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. For ease of comprehension, the parties are referred to by their  status
    on appeal before the First-tier Tribunal. By way of a letter  dated  28
    September 2015, the Respondent has requested that her case  be  treated
    as withdrawn by the Upper Tribunal.

 2. This request was  confirmed  to  me  by  oral  submissions  from  Ms  S
    Sreeraman,  a  Senior  Presenting  Officer,  who  confirmed  that   the
    withdrawal was confirmed by  a  Mr  McGirr,  a  senior  member  of  the
    Specialist Appeals Team.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the Appellant was the successful  party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 4. Accorindingly with my consent,  and  pursuant  to  rule  17(5)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, this appeal is recorded
    as "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This is a Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform  the  parties  that  the  Respondent's
    appeal is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the Respondent's case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision, allowing the Appellant's appeal, shall stand.
