Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms S Shah, instructed by Robinson Ravani & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. These appellants appeal with permission against the  dismissal  of  the
    principal appellant's application to vary leave to remain as a  Tier  4
    (General) Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based  system,  and  the
    appeals of her husband and two children against  the  decision  not  to
    vary their leave  to  remain  as  her  dependents,  in  line  with  the
    principal appellant's application.  is the determination in the  appeal
    of Mrs Jagrutiben Pankajkumar Chavda.

 2. The accompanying decisions to remove the appellants under Section 47 of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 are unlawful,  as  the
    Upper  Tribunal  held  in  Adamally  and  Jaferi  (section  47  removal
    decisions: Tribunal Procedures) Sri Lanka [2012]  UKUT  414  (IAC).  Mr
    Nath accepts that the s.47 decisions cannot be sustained.

 3. However, in relation to the refusal of the applications  for  leave  to
    vary, there were  two  issues,  the  first  being  that  the  principal
    appellant's CAS was not accompanied by the supporting  evidence  as  it
    should have been.  At paragraph 16 of the determination the judge found
    that the respondent had failed  to  apply  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy and to call for the missing documents and that the appellant was
    entitled to succeed on that ground  in  relation  to  the  certificate.
    There is therefore no issue on the CAS and the respondent has not filed
    a Rule 24 notice raising any issue on that point.

The Maintenance (Funds) issue

 4. At the date of application the appellant's funding,  as  she  disclosed
    it, fell short by �10.03 of the required figure of  �4300.   �10.03  is
    not a large sum but the Rules are plain.   Ms  Shah  conceded  both  at
    first instance and before  me  that  the  appellant  had  not  provided
    evidence to show that she had any greater sum.   It  is  now  suggested
    that she had another bank account, for which she  can  produce  a  bank
    statement which would take her account over the required sum of �4,300,
    but the bank statement for that account which is in court today is  not
    dated within the 28 days before the period ending 17  August  2013  and
    therefore cannot assist the appellant.

 5. The appellant challenges the finding that an account in  her  husband's
    sole name can not be prayed in aid.  Again,  the  Rules  are  perfectly
    plain on this point and reliance on an account in  her  husband's  sole
    name is not permitted.  The position thus remains that  the  appellant,
    when she submitted her application, did not submit  evidence  that  she
    had the required sum of �4,300, and accordingly the immigration  appeal
    cannot succeed.

Article 8 ECHR

 6. Permission to appeal was also granted on Article 8 ECHR  but  that  was
    not pursued in the skeleton argument before me. As noted in  the  grant
    of permission, the Article 8 claim was on any view  a  weak  one  since
    this family would be removed, if at all, together, and none of them are
    British or EU citizens.

 7. Accordingly, on all of the grounds in the grounds of appeal, save  that
    relating to Section 47, the appellant's appeal fails.

Conclusions:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the decision  and  remake
it by allowing the appeal against the decision to  make  removal  directions
under s.47 Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

The appeal is  dismissed  on  all  other  grounds,  including  human  rights
grounds.

Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.  Nothing in  the
documents before me indicates that anonymity is necessary or appropriate  in
these appeals.
