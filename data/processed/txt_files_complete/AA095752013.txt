Representation:
For the appellant:  Mr Sarwar, instructed by Sehgal & Co
For the respondent: Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                                DETERMINATION

 1. This appeal was brought by the appellant against the decision dated  25
    January 2014 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Broe who dismissed the appeal
    against the respondent's  decision dated 7 October 2013 to  refuse  the
    appellant's asylum, human rights and humanitarian protection claims.

 2. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on 1 April 2014.



 3. At the hearing, Mr Sarwar informed me that the appellant  had  returned
    to Pakistan of his own volition.

 4. The provisions of Section  104  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 apply in these circumstances. The appeal is not finally
    determined, i.e. is pending, by way of s.104 (2) (b). Where that is so.
    s.104 (4) provides that the appeal should be treated  as  abandoned  as
    the appellant has left the United Kingdom.

 5. The appeal is abandoned.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  I  continue  that
order under rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
in particular as a result of the medical issues of the appellant.
