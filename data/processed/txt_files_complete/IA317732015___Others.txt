                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants, nationals of  Mauritius,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  against  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State  dated  8th
    September 2015 to refuse their applications for leave to remain in  the
    UK on the basis of their private and family life under Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights.  First-tier Tribunal Judge  Callow
    dismissed the appeals in a decision promulgated on 22nd November  2016.
    The Appellants appeal to this Tribunal with permission granted by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Saffer on 29th June 2017.

 2. The background to this appeal is that the second Appellant  arrived  in
    the UK on 20th January 2007 with a student visa valid  until  24th  May
    2009.  His wife and children, the first, third and  fourth  Appellants,
    arrived in the UK on 14th September 2007.  When they entered the UK the
    third Appellant was aged 7 and the fourth Appellant was aged  8.   They
    were all granted leave to remain until 25th August 2014 but their leave
    was curtailed on 13th August 2013 when the second  Appellant's  college
    lost its licence.  The Appellants applied to vary their leave to remain
    but their applications were refused  and  their  appeals  dismissed  by
    Immigration Judge Vaudin d'Im�court in a decision promulgated  on  31st
    March 2014.  The Appellants applied for permission  to  appeal  against
    Judge Vaudin d'Im�court's decision but that  application  was  refused.
    On 21st May 2014 the Appellants were deemed  to  have  exhausted  their
    rights of appeal.

 3. On 17th  March  2015  the  first  Appellant  applied,  with  the  other
    Appellants as her dependants, for  leave  to  remain  on  private  life
    grounds based  on  the  fact  that  the  children  had  by  then  lived
    continuously in the UK for  over  seven  years  and  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to require all of the Appellants to leave the UK.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge

 4. Judge Callow noted at paragraph 7 that the children were, at  the  time
    of the appeal hearing, A level students who had established friendships
    in the UK and that the fourth Appellant is actively involved in the Chi
    combat system  of  martial  arts.   The  Judge  noted  that  the  first
    Appellant was in full-time employment  and  the  second  Appellant  was
    unemployed. The judge recorded that the first Appellant's  relationship
    with her family in Mauritius was fractious  and  a  dispute  as  to  an
    inheritance was ongoing.

 5. Judge Callow considered the guidelines in Devaseelan [2002] UKAIT 00702
    and noted that, apart from the fact that the children had now  exceeded
    the seven year threshold of continuous residence in the UK,  the  facts
    in this appeal were not materially different from  those  before  Judge
    Vaudin d'Im�court [13]. The judge noted that  the  Appellants'  claims,
    save  for  a  family  rift  over  an  inheritance,  are  supported   by
    essentially the same evidence as was before  Judge  Vaudin  d'Im�court.
    The judge therefore considered that all other issues had  been  settled
    by Judge Vaudin d'Im�court's determination. The  judge  considered  the
    provisions of paragraph 276ADE(1) (iv) and (vi).  The judge  considered
    the relevant case law and addressed the question as to  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK at paragraphs  21  to
    27.  The judge noted that the children had been in the UK for just over
    seven years and  that  it  was  likely  that  they  would  suffer  some
    interruption with the completion of their A levels but, based on  their
    ability, there was no reason to differ  from  the  assessment  made  by
    Judge Vaudin d'Im�court that the children were  exceptionally  talented
    and doing extremely well at school.  The  judge  noted  that  the  best
    interests of the children would probably be served by them remaining in
    the UK but took into account the fact that the Appellants ignored Judge
    Vaudin d'Im�court's decision, that the first Appellant  worked  without
    any right to do so and the children were educated  at  public  expense.
    The judge took into  account  the  evidence  of  potential  educational
    disadvantage in Mauritius [23].  The judge took into account  the  fact
    that the family unit would remain intact as the family would be removed
    together.   The  judge  also  considered  the  parents'  'defiance'  of
    immigration control [25]. He concluded that it would be  reasonable  to
    expect the children to live in Mauritius and therefore  concluded  that
    the children did not meet the requirements of 276ADE(1)(iv).  The judge
    considered 276ADE(1)(vi) and concluded that it had not been established
    that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  family's
    integration  in  Mauritius  [28].   The  judge   concluded   that   the
    Appellants' appeals failed under the Immigration Rules.

 6. The judge went on to consider whether it was appropriate to assess  the
    appeal under Article 8 and concluded that there were  no  good  grounds
    not already fully addressed in the consideration  under  the  Rules  to
    show that residual Article 8 protection ought to be extended [32].  The
    judge considered that the Appellants' private lives had been  addressed
    under the Rules where all relevant factors had  been  considered  [33].
    In the judge's view, the  general  public  interest  in  maintaining  a
    consistent and effective policy of immigration control was  adverse  to
    the Appellants in this appeal.  The judge noted that no evidence of any
    weight beyond disruption to the education  of  the  children  had  been
    given and it had not been shown that it would be unduly harsh to return
    to Mauritius or that there were  any  exceptional  circumstances  [36].
    The judge noted that no good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules had been established.

The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. In the Grounds of  Appeal  the  Appellants  contend  that  the  judge's
    decision is flawed, incorrect in law, unfair and unsustainable.  It  is
    contended  that  the  Appellants  did  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules unlike the situation before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Vaudin d'Im�court. It is contended that the judge erred  in  fact
    by asserting that the children had only lived in the UK for seven years
    whereas in fact they had lived in the UK for nine years at the date  of
    the hearing.  It is contended that the Immigration  Judge  applied  the
    wrong test under paragraph 276ADE in that  he  failed  to  examine  the
    children's ties and commitments in the UK.  It is  contended  that  the
    judge failed to consider that their established ties and involvement in
    life in the UK meant that  any  requirement  for  the  removal  of  the
    children was clearly unreasonable.  The grounds argue  that  the  judge
    failed to take proper account of the events and  circumstances  in  the
    Appellants' home country which show that it is clearly unreasonable and
    unsuitable for the children to return.  It is contended that the  judge
    failed to take account of the length of time the Appellants  had  lived
    in the UK and had failed to take into account that the elder child  had
    nearly passed half of all her life in the UK which is also a qualifying
    category under paragraph 276ADE.  It is argued that the judge erred  in
    failing to consider the application under Article 8.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer on
    29th June 2017 on the grounds  that  it  is  arguable  that  the  judge
    materially erred in assessing the strength  of  the  third  and  fourth
    Appellant's case by failing to consider the evidence as at the date  of
    the hearing as by then there had been a one year and  eight  month  gap
    between the date of the application and the hearing.  It was considered
    arguable that the judge did not give adequate weight to the  impact  of
    the additional time spent in the UK.

Error of Law

 9. At the hearing before  me  Mr  Aihe  made  two  main  submissions.   He
    submitted that the judge erred in his assessment of  the  appeal  under
    276ADE and in relation to his approach to Article 8.

10. In relation to the consideration under paragraph 276ADE Mr Aihe firstly
    contended that the judge relied heavily on the determination  of  Judge
    Vaudin d'Im�court and failed to make  his  own  assessment  as  to  the
    position at the date of the hearing.  I do not accept that  submission.
    The judge set out the findings of Judge Vaudin d'Im�court at  paragraph
    3 of the decision.  These findings took account of factors such as  the
    languages spoken by  the  family,  the  employment  prospects  for  the
    parents in Mauritius, the education system in  Mauritius,  the  martial
    art of Chi undertaken by the children, the family ties in Mauritius and
    the age and education of  the  children.   Judge  Callow  set  out  the
    current circumstances at paragraph 7. The judge properly  set  out  the
    principles established in the case of  Devaseelan  and  other  relevant
    case law at paragraph 11. At paragraph 13  the  judge  highlighted  the
    main developments since Judge Vaudin d'Im�court's decision. In my  view
    it is clear that the judge took the correct approach to the decision of
    the previous judge in accordance with the guidelines in Devaseelan.  It
    is clear that the judge treated the decision of Judge Vaudin d'Im�court
    as an authoritative determination of the issues before him at that time
    and then took into account the additional factors including the passage
    of time, the fact that the children had by then exceeded the seven year
    threshold of residence in the UK and the Appellant's dispute  with  her
    family in Mauritius.

11. The judge went on to consider whether it is reasonable  to  expect  the
    children to leave the UK in accordance with paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)  of
    the Immigration Rules.  It is clear  that  the  judge  approached  this
    issue afresh on the basis of Judge Vaudin d'Im�court's findings and the
    up-to-date evidence and I find no error in the judge's approach to  the
    decision of Judge Vaudin d'Im�court.

12. Mr Aihe further argued that Judge Callow erred in his consideration  of
    reasonableness under paragraph 276ADE (1)(iv) of the  Rules.  Paragraph
    276ADE(1) sets out the requirements to be met by an  applicant  at  the
    date of the application.  The  judge  set  out  the  relevant  law  and
    considered the issue of reasonableness at paragraphs 21 to 27.  In this
    consideration the judge looked at the interruption the  children  would
    face in terms of the completion of their A levels in Mauritius. He took
    into account the fact that  the  parents  would  be  removed  with  the
    children and that the family would be removed together.  The judge also
    looked at the immigration history of the parents.  The judge took  into
    account the  findings  of  Judge  Vaudin  d'Im�court  as  well  as  the
    additional factors and concluded that it would be reasonable to  expect
    the children to live  in  Mauritius.   Whilst  it  is  clear  that  the
    Appellants disagree with that decision in my view it is clear that  the
    judge did consider all relevant factors in terms  of  consideration  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) and reached a conclusion, open to  him  on  the
    evidence, that it is reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK.

13. The judge went on to consider 276ADE(1)(vi) and concluded  that,  based
    on the findings of Judge Vaudin d'Im�court and the evidence before him,
    that it had not been  established  that  there  were  very  significant
    obstacles to the family's integration in Mauritius [28].  This  finding
    is not challenged.

14. In terms of the findings under the Rules Mr Aihe did not point  to  any
    evidence not considered  by  the  judge.  I  do  not  agree  with  that
    submission  that  the  judge  gave  insufficient  reasoning   for   his
    reasonableness assessment. He set out his reasoning at paragraphs 21 to
    27 which contains reference to the previous judge's  decision  and  the
    current situation.  I am  satisfied  that  the  judge  gave  sufficient
    reasons for reaching his conclusions on the Rules which  were  open  to
    him on the evidence before him.

15. Mr Aihe contended on behalf of the Appellants that the judge  erred  in
    his approach to Article 8.  At paragraphs 30 to 37 the judge considered
    whether  there  were  good  grounds  not  already  addressed   in   the
    consideration  under  the  Rules  to  show  that  residual  Article   8
    protection ought to be extended.

16. Mr Aihe submitted that at the date of the hearing the older  child  was
    just 4 months short of qualifying under  paragraph  276ADE(1)(v)  which
    provides for a grant of leave to remain  where  an  applicant  is  aged
    between 18 and 25 and has spent  at  least  half  of  his  life  living
    continuously in the UK. However it is not clear  that  this  submission
    was put to the judge.  I did not have the Appellants'  bundle  produced
    in the First-tier Tribunal before me.  Although he had an index for the
    bundle, Mr Aihe did not have the bundle itself, so he could  not  point
    to anything before the judge in relation to this submission. He did not
    produce any skeleton argument submitted in the First-tier Tribunal  nor
    did he produce any witness statement or other evidence to  support  his
    claim that at the time of the hearing  the  third  Appellant  was  four
    months short of qualifying under 276ADE(1)(v).

17. In any event, even if it were the case and even if it had been drawn to
    the attention of the judge, this issue would not have been given weight
    in the proportionality assessment. Firstly, as pointed out  above,  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE must be met at the date of application
    and there is no suggestion that they were in this case.  Further,  even
    if the children were close to meeting  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE (1)(v) a 'near miss'  is  not  a  weighty  factor  in  assessing
    proportionality.  It is not clear  how,  if  put  to  the  judge,  this
    argument would have influenced the outcome of an Article 8  assessment.



18. Turning to the judge's assessment of Article 8 at paragraphs 30  to  37
    he considered the issues and concluded that there  were  no  additional
    factors or good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the Rules.
    This could indicate that the  judge  failed  to  undertake  a  complete
    assessment in accordance with the guidance in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27
    taking account of the current circumstances. However  on  reading  this
    section of the decision as a whole it is sufficiently clear  that  this
    is what the judge did do.  The judge noted at  paragraph  32  that  the
    reasonableness assessment he had already undertaken required a  similar
    approach to that required in the proportionality exercise.   The  judge
    therefore considered that he had already addressed the relevant factors
    in his consideration of the reasonableness question under 276ADE.   The
    judge noted at paragraph 33 that there was no gap between  the  factors
    considered under 276ADE and a freestanding  Article  8  assessment  and
    that no submissions establishing a gap had been advanced by Mr Aihe  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.   The  judge  took  into  account  the  public
    interest and noted that no compelling circumstances had been identified
    for the grant of leave outside the Rules [35] and no  evidence  of  any
    weight beyond disruption to the education  of  the  children  had  been
    given that it would be unduly harsh to  return  to  Mauritius  or  that
    there had been any exceptional circumstances [36]. The  judge  assessed
    further factors at paragraph 37.

19. Mr Aihe complained that at this stage the judge should have  considered
    the fact that the children had at the date of the hearing lived in  the
    UK for nine years.  However it is clear from reading the decision as  a
    whole that the judge was aware of the children's length  of  residence.
    The judge made reference  to  the  fact  that  the  children  had  been
    resident in the UK for seven and a half years  at  the  time  of  their
    application [5]. He set out the current circumstances  at  paragraph  7
    noting that the children were, at the time of the hearing, studying for
    A levels.  He was aware of the potential disruption to  the  children's
    education [21, 36]. In my view the  judge  was  aware  of  the  further
    passage of time since the application for leave to  remain  and  it  is
    clear reading the decision as a whole that this was a factor  which  he
    did not consider sufficient  to  outweigh  the  other  factors  already
    considered which were relevant to the assessment under Article 8 in the
    particular circumstances of this case.

20. The assessment carried out by the judge in relation  to  free  standing
    Article 8 was to some extent circular  in  that,  in  deciding  whether
    there were any other factors to be considered in an assessment  outside
    the Rules, he considered all relevant factors  before  concluding  that
    there were no good grounds for granting leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules.  However in my view this was sufficient to show that  the  judge
    had engaged with the wider Article 8 issues and reached  a  conclusion,
    open to him on the evidence, that there was nothing  significant  which
    would outweigh the weight given to the Rules. Although I did  not  have
    the Appellants' bundle before the First-tier Tribunal before me nor  it
    appeared did Mr Aihe, he did not seek an adjournment in order to obtain
    that bundle and he did not point to any  specific  evidence  addressing
    current circumstances before the judge which he had failed to take into
    account.

21. I accept Mr Nath's submission that in this case the judge  had  already
    considered the position of the Appellants under the Rules as qualifying
    children, therefore apart from further advancement of  time  there  was
    nothing further that the judge could have considered in a  freestanding
    Article 8 assessment.   Apart  from  the  additional  passage  of  time
    between the application and the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal,  it
    is not at all clear from Mr Aihe's submissions what additional  factors
    could have led the judge to a different conclusion in relation  to  the
    Article 8 assessment.  Mr Aihe was unable  to  point  to  any  specific
    evidence in relation to the current circumstances at the  date  of  the
    hearing which was not considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

22. At the end of the hearing I indicated that I did not accept that  there
    was an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision.   After  the
    conclusion of the hearing Mr Aihe requested an opportunity  to  address
    the Tribunal again in  relation  to  a  fundamental  matter.   When  he
    returned to court Mr Aihe complained that,  when  he  had  been  making
    submissions in relation to  paragraph  276ADE  (1)  (v),  Mr  Nath  had
    interrupted his submissions to object  that  the  issue  had  not  been
    raised in the grounds and that I had  agreed  with  Mr  Nath.  Mr  Aihe
    complained that he had felt intimidated and had been unable  to  follow
    through his point in relation to the children being four  months  short
    of meeting the requirements of 276ADE(1)(v).   He pointed to  paragraph
    8 of the grounds which he said did in fact raise this issue.  However I
    explained that my concern in relation to this issue  was  not  so  much
    whether it had been raised in the  grounds  but  whether  it  had  been
    raised before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

23. I gave Mr Aihe the opportunity to make any submissions which he felt he
    had been denied the opportunity to raise at an earlier stage.  Mr  Aihe
    reiterated his submission that the judge failed to  take  into  account
    the fact that, at the time of the hearing, the third Appellant was four
    months short of meeting the requirements of paragraph  276ADE(1)(v).  I
    reminded Mr Aihe that he had made this point during his submissions and
    that I had noted it and taken it into account.  When asked, Mr Aihe was
    unable to make any  further  points  which  he  claimed  to  have  been
    prevented from making at an earlier stage.  I remained of the view that
    it was not clear whether or how this point was put to  the  judge.   In
    any event I remain of the view that, even had the judge taken this into
    consideration, a near-miss in relation to the Immigration Rules is  not
    capable of resolving the proportionality assessment in  favour  of  the
    Appellants.

24. In conclusion, I am satisfied that Judge Callow  properly  applied  the
    principles in the case of Devaseelan in his approach to the decision of
    Judge Vaudin d'Im�court.  The judge reached conclusions open to him  on
    the evidence in relation  to  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  concerning  the
    reasonableness of expecting the children to leave  the  UK.  The  judge
    reached conclusions open to him on  the  evidence  that  there  are  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the  family's  reintegration  in  Mauritius
    under paragraph 276ADE (1)(vi). I find that the judge's approach to his
    assessment under Article 8 was adequate and his conclusions  were  open
    to him on the basis of the evidence before him.
