Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Jones, instructed by Connaught Law

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is a citizen of Pakistan
   born on 14 May 1983.


2. The claimant entered the UK in October 2009 as a Tier 4 (General)
   Student. He subsequently made several applications (including on 28
   January 2012) to extend his leave to remain.


3. On 13 August 2014 he applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1
   (Entrepreneur) Migrant. On 5 November 2015 this application was refused
   under paragraphs 322(1A) and 322(2) of the Immigration Rules on the basis
   that the claimant had made false representations by submitting a
   fraudulently obtained TOEIC certificate. In the Secretary of State's
   refusal letter it is stated that there was significant evidence to
   conclude that the claimant had used a proxy test taker to take an English
   language test administered by Educational Testing Service ("ETS"). The
   test in question was taken at Synergy Business College on 20 December
   2011 and the certificate from this test was submitted by the claimant
   with his application for leave to remain made on 28 January 2012.

4. The claimant maintains that he took the test himself and appealed to the
   First-tier Tribunal where his appeal was heard by Judge Wylie. The judge
   allowed the appeal.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5. Before the First-tier Tribunal, in order to establish that the claimant
   had acted fraudulently through the use of a proxy test taker, the
   Secretary of State relied upon evidence that has been used in numerous
   similar cases where it has been alleged that a test conducted by ETS was
   invalid because a proxy test taker was used. This included statements of
   Mr Millington and Ms Collings (both civil servants) concerning the
   processes by which fraudulent conduct has been detected at ETS test
   centres and a report from Professor French on the methodology used by ETS
   to detect fraudulent activity. In addition, the Secretary of State
   submitted a print out from a spreadsheet (known as the "look up tool")
   showing that the claimant's test had been categorised by ETS as invalid
   and a report from 'Project Faï¿½ade' showing that between 24 November 2011
   and 15 January 2013 49% of tests undertaken at Synergy Business college
   were identified by ETS as invalid. The ETS TOEIC Look up Tool states that
   of 45 tests taken on the date of the claimant's test (20 December 2011)
   at Synergy Business college 73% were identified as invalid.


6. The conclusions of Judge Wylie are set out in paragraphs 16 to 22 of the
   decision.


7. The judge, at paragraphs 16 to 18, discussed the Secretary of State's
   evidence, highlighting the evidence concerning the high number of tests
   taken on 20 December 2011 that were classified as invalid by ETS.


8. The judge then turned to consider the claimant's claim to have taken the
   test in person.


9. At paragraph 19 the judge stated:


        I acknowledge that the [claimant] was able to give evidence at the
        hearing in English, but this was 5 years after the date of the
        test, and I do not give any weight to this. However it seems, given
        his studies, and the fact that he achieved his MBA educational
        qualification in 2012, that the claimant was sufficiently competent
        in English to have passed the examination in December 2011. There
        would therefore be no reason for him to jeopardise his career and
        future by cheating in the test"

10. At paragraph 21 the judge stated that the claimant "has provided a
   satisfactory explanation of his actings. I find the [claimant] to be
   credible in his explanation of sitting the test on the two dates".

11. At paragraph 22 the judge concluded by stating that he was "not
   satisfied that it has been shown that the [claimant] fraudulently
   obtained a total certificate following a test on 20 December 2011."


Grounds of Appeal


12. The grounds of appeal submit that the judge failed to assess correctly
   the burden of proof in line with the Upper Tribunal decision SM and Qadir
   v Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden of
   Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC). The grounds argue that the judge erred by
   not recognising that the Secretary of State had satisfied the initial
   evidential burden.


13. The grounds further contend that the judge failed to properly consider
   the Secretary of State's evidence. It is maintained in the grounds that
   had the judge properly considered the Secretary of State's evidence it
   would have been clear that deception had been demonstrated. The grounds
   note in particular the evidence that on the day the test was taken 73% of
   the tests were found to be invalid.


14. The grounds also argue that the judge has failed to give adequate
   reasoning why the Secretary of State has not met the legal burden and why
   it is accepted that the claimant gave an innocent explanation. The
   grounds maintain that the judge failed to give adequate reasons for
   holding that because the claimant speaks English he would have no reason
   to use deception when the case law makes clear that there could be many
   reasons why a person who is proficient in English might engage in fraud.
   See MA Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450.


Submissions at Hearing

15. Mr Jarvis on behalf of the Secretary of State argued that the only
   innocent explanation identified by the judge was that the claimant had no
   reason to cheat. This, he argued, is the full extent of the judge's
   reasoning, and it is not sufficient.


16.  Mr Jarvis was critical of the judge for failing to engage with
   Professor French's report, which in his view authoritatively shows that
   the margin of error is under 1%. Mr Jarvis maintained that the judge
   reached the conclusion that the Secretary of State did not meet the legal
   burden without properly considering and appreciating the strength of the
   evidence adduced by the Secretary of State to support the case against
   the claimant.


17. Mr Jones, for the claimant, argued that it is clear, when reading the
   decision as a whole, that the judge has followed SM and Qadir, which is
   mentioned in paragraph 12. He noted that the judge explicitly stated at
   paragraph 16 that he gave careful scrutiny to the evidence.


18. Mr Jones argued that if the judge took into account all of the material
   evidence, correctly identified the burden of proof, reached a reasonable
   view on credibility, and gave reasoning that was sufficient for the
   unsuccessful party to understand the basis of the outcome, then there is
   no error of law. Mr Jones submitted that the judge heard detailed
   evidence including cross examination of the claimant before concluding
   that he was credible and his credibility findings cannot reasonably be
   challenged.


Analysis and Decision


19. The burden and standard of proof, where it is alleged that an ETS test
   is invalid, was discussed in SM and Qadir, and is as follows:

20. The legal burden of proving that the test taker used deception lies on
   the Secretary of State albeit that there is a three stage process.

    a) Firstly, the Secretary of State must adduce sufficient evidence to
       raise the issue of fraud.


    b) Secondly, the test taker then has a burden of raising an innocent
       explanation which satisfies the minimum level of plausibility.


    c) Thirdly, if that burden is discharged, the Secretary of State must
       establish on a balance of probabilities that this innocent
       explanation is to be rejected.


21. There is one civil standard of proof (which is the standard to be
   applied). The seriousness of the consequences does not require a
   different standard of proof but flexibility in its application will
   involve consideration of the strength and quality of the evidence. The
   more serious the consequence, the stronger must be the evidence adduced
   for the necessary standard to be reached.


22. In SSHD v Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615 the Court of Appeal concluded
   that the "generic evidence" (comprising in that case of the same
   statements of Ms Collings and Mr Millington submitted in this appeal)
   together with the evidence that the test of individual in question has
   been assessed as "invalid", was sufficient for the Secretary of State to
   meet the initial evidential burden (the first of the three stages)
   thereby shifting the evidential burden onto the test taker to raise an
   innocent explanation (the second of the three stages).  At paragraph 26
   the Court of Appeal in Shehzad concluded that "the in limine rejection of
   the Secretary of State's evidence as even sufficient to shift the
   evidential burden was an error of law".


23. In this case, the Secretary of State submitted the statements of Ms
   Collings and Mr Millington (the generic evidence evaluated in Shehzad)
   along with evidence showing the claimant's test had been assessed by ETS
   as invalid.


24. In addition, the Secretary of State submitted a report by Professor
   French giving opinion evidence on ETS's methodology for detecting fraud.
   Professor French's expertise was not questioned before the First-tier
   Tribunal and it is noted that the High Court in Gaogalalwe [2017] EWHC
   1709 (Admin), considering the same report, described Professor French as
   a "singularly well qualified expert". Professor French's conclusion was
   that ETS's error rate in identifying fraud was very low.


25. Moreover, the Secretary of State submitted evidence to show that almost
   three quarters (73%) of the tests taken on the dates the claimant took
   the test were found to be invalid and that during the relevant period
   49%of tests undertaken at Synergy Business college were identified by ETS
   as invalid.


26. As argued by Mr Jarvis, the Secretary of State has put forward a
   substantial amount of evidence which strongly indicates deception was
   engaged in by the claimant and that it is unlikely a mistake was made in
   identifying the claimant as having used deception.


27. The judge's analysis of the Secretary of State's evidence is very
   brief. However, it is not necessary for a judge to recount in detail the
   contents of a party's evidence and it is clear from the decision (in
   particular paragraphs 15 and 16) that the judge was aware of, and had
   regard to, all of the material evidence, including the report of Prof
   French and the evaluation of cheating at Synergy business college.


28. Reading the decision as a whole, I am of the view that the judge's
   approach to the evidence is consistent with SM and Qadir. Although not
   stated explicitly, it is apparent that the judge accepted that the
   Secretary of State satisfied the initial evidential burden to raise the
   issue of fraud.


29. The judge then proceeded to address whether the claimant was able to
   raise an innocent explanation. The claimant submitted a detailed witness
   statement and was cross examined. Assessing the claimant's evidence was a
   matter for the judge and the judge was entitled to conclude that the
   claimant was credible and accept his account of taking the test. It might
   have been an error of law if the sole reason the judge found the claimant
   credible was that he had a good level of English when the test was taken
   and therefore did not need to cheat. However, this is only part of the
   reason the judge gave for accepting the claimant's account.  It is clear
   from the decision that the judge also had regard to the claimant's
   account of attending and taking the test as well as his educational
   background.


30. Having found that the initial evidential burden was satisfied by the
   Secretary of State and that the claimant had raised an innocent
   explanation, it fell to the judge to assess whether the Secretary of
   State had discharged the legal burden of showing fraud had been engaged
   in by the claimant, which is what the judge has done.


31. The Secretary of State's evidence established it was likely the
   claimant acted fraudulently but not that he definitely did so. It was for
   the judge to form a view on the claimant's credibility and "innocent
   explanation" and weigh this against the Secretary of State's evidence.
   The relative weight to give to the evidence was a matter for the judge
   and I am satisfied that the judge, having taken into account all of the
   material evidence, reached a conclusion that was open to him.


Decision


A. The appeal is dismissed.

B. The judge has not made a material error of law and the decision of the
First-tier Tribunal stands.
