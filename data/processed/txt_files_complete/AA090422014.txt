Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr S Muquit of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born  on  22  April  1986.   She
   appeals to the Upper Tribunal against the  determination  of  Immigration
   Judge Oscar Del Fabbro dated 14 March 2015, refusing her  appeal  against
   the decision of the respondent dated 15 October 2014, refusing her  claim
   for asylum and humanitarian protection in the United Kingdom.

2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Zuker  on
   13 April 2015 stating that it was arguable that  the  Judge  applied  the
   wrong standard of proof to the medical evidence of Dr Martin.

   The first-tier Tribunal's findings

3. The Judge in his  determination  made  the  following  findings  which  I
   summarise.

   I. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 26 April  2014  hidden  in
      the boot of a car. She claimed asylum  on  28  April  2014  which  was
      refused by the respondent. At the hearing, at which the appellant  was
      present, she was not called to give evidence because it was  contented
      that she was not fit to do so in  light  of  her  current  mental  and
      physical  condition.  Dr  Saleh  Dhumad,  a  consultant   psychiatrist
      concluded in his report dated 27 January 2015 that the  appellant  was
      unfit to attend the hearing and give evidence. The report stated  this
      after an interview with the appellant on 19 December 2014. The  report
      stated that the appellant was severely depressed and had symptoms akin
      to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The appellant  however  prepared  a
      witness statement with the assistance of her solicitors.




  II. The appellant claims that she is an ethnic Tamil of the Roman Catholic
      faith. Before leaving Sri Lanka in 2013, she lived with her parents in
      Jaffna. She formed a relationship with a man who she described as  her
      fianc�. He was killed after he was shot in a shop on  15  April  2006.
      She believes that  her  fianc�  was  killed  because  the  authorities
      believed that he was involved with the LTTE. The  appellant  left  for
      Vani with her brother and lived there until 23 April 2006.




 III. The appellant has to show on a lower civil standard of  proof  adopted
      in asylum cases, that there is a real risk of persecution  because  of
      her reputed political opinion. In essence  the  appellant  must  prove
      that there is a chance that she remains of interest to the authorities
      and/or would be on a stop list on return to Sri  Lanka  and  that  she
      would be likely to be detained either on entry or later and  that  she
      would be ill-treated as a result.




  IV. The credibility of the appellant's account is the  starting  point  of
      deliberations. The appellant's account is not credible.  Although  she
      is a Tamil from a Christian background, who on balance  may  have  had
      some association with the LTTE as a forced  conscript,  in  the  later
      part of the long-running civil conflict in Sri Lanka, I find that  she
      would not have been of any interest to  the  authorities  seven  years
      after the cessation of  hostilities  and  after  being  processed  and
      released through an IDP camp in July/August 2009. On her own  account,
      the appellant had no distinguishing involvement with the  LTTE  during
      the short time  she  served  as  a  conscript.  She  gave  conflicting
      accounts of her role in her interview. She certainly  did  not  occupy
      any position of importance in the command structure,  gave  no  orders
      and was not involved in combat operations. She was not in contact with
      any senior officers or personnel associated with the LTTE in the  area
      or had knowledge or understanding, on my reading of her account, as to
      what was happening in the conflict at the time.  Her  claim  that  she
      left the LTTE camp in April 2009,  is  at  odds  with  the  background
      evidence that by January 2009 the area was under the  control  of  the
      Sri Lankan Army.

   V. The appellant comes from a respectable law-abiding  family  background
      who had no connection  with  the  LTTE  movement.  Neither  did  other
      members of her family and  relations  and  the  area  do  not  have  a
      background of civil or armed conflict with  the  authorities.  In  her
      interview the appellant expressed her personal view that she  did  not
      believe in a separate  Tamil  State  which  in  essence  is  in  stark
      contrast to the raison d'�tre of the LTTE  movement.  Her  explanation
      about the reasons for her detention lacked detail and consistency such
      that I find on a recount and set against the background evidence  that
      the appellant could never have been suspected of any LTTE or terrorist
      activity let alone involved in such activities in 2011 as she  asserts
      in her account.




  VI. The appellant asserts that the reason why she came to the attention of
      the authorities was because her fianc� was killed in 2006,  is  in  my
      assessment tenuous and speculative. There  is  no  evidence  that  her
      fianc� was involved with the LTTE. He was shot and killed according to
      contemporary press reports, in the shop where he was working. It would
      appear that he was shot during a visit to that shop by armed men.  The
      photographs in  the  bundle  of  his  funeral  provide  no  indication
      whatsoever that he was involved with the LTTE.




 VII. The appellant  once  processed  and  released  through  the  IDP  camp
      returned to live at her family home. I do not accept her evidence that
      she was living in various locations to avoid the  authorities  because
      when making her claim, she provided as her last address in  Sri  Lanka
      as her mother's home address. Moreover, at the time she had no  reason
      to be in fear of any authority as she had been  cleared  and  released
      into the community. It is not credible that the appellant would  could
      have been the subject of such intense adverse attention from  the  CID
      for no apparent reason other than the fact that she  may  have  had  a
      connection with her fianc� in 2006. On the  evidence,  it  is  equally
      unlikely that she would have been detained in this way, brutally  ill-
      treated on account yet at the same time permitted access to  a  lawyer
      who confirms that he was able to make  contact  with  the  chief  army
      officer at the Jaffna area army  camp  and  offered  his  services  in
      securing  her  release.  The  lawyer  was  apparently  told  that  the
      authorities suspected that she was involved with anti-government Tamil
      youth groups and others. There is no evidence from the appellant  that
      this was the nature of the accusations  levelled  against  her  during
      detention.




VIII. It is not credible that the appellant, given the level of her  claimed
      ill-treatment alleged by the CID, in detention, namely  that  she  was
      involved in a resurgence of LTTE activity would have been released  on
      the payment of a bribe and shortly thereafter permitted to  leave  the
      area, travel to Colombo, avoid security checks  at  the  international
      airport and able to depart the country without any problems.




  IX. Adverse credibility findings are also made against the  appellant  for
      her failure to claim asylum in France which is  a  safe  country.  Her
      failed attempt to enter the United Kingdom in  January  2014  and  her
      incredible assertions that she was oblivious to where she was for many
      months and was unable to do anything for herself, is not credible. She
      is an educated mature woman with academic qualifications.  Her  mental
      condition was not so acute that given the medical  report  notes,  the
      deterioration in her medical happened once in the United  Kingdom.  In
      her interview she provided cogent and detailed responses to questions.
      Her first attempted entry into the United Kingdom failed when she  was
      encountered in the boot of  a  motor  vehicle.  The  evidence  of  the
      encounter is provided by the respondent  but  the  appellant  made  no
      mention of this incident. The fact that she  attempted  illegal  entry
      into  the  United  Kingdom,  she  must  have   been   aware   of   the
      precariousness of the situation in France and did  nothing  to  secure
      international protection not claim asylum there.




   X. The appellant said that  she  managed  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom
      clandestinely but she is unable to explain how this was achieved.  She
      must have been able  to  contact  her  uncle  in  order  to  know  the
      arrangements upon entering the United Kingdom where she  was  able  to
      meet  up  with  her  uncle's  friend  in  the  United  Kingdom.   This
      demonstrate that this was  a  well  planned  trip  to  facilitate  the
      appellant's entry into the United Kingdom and  mitigates  against  the
      scenario which the appellant presents, namely, that she was in genuine
      fear at the time of her flight from Sri Lanka.




  XI. "I have given careful consideration to the medical report of Mr Andres
      Martin, consultant in emergency medicine, in relation to  his  finding
      of the scarring. He concludes that the scars to the  back,  chest  and
      lower limbs were caused intentionally unlikely by a third party. He is
      unable to say that the injuries were caused by torture  nor  rule  out
      self-infliction by proxy. The medical report concerning  her  injuries
      did not provide incontrovertible evidence that the injuries could have
      only been sustained as a result of torture. I  have  to  consider  his
      opinion in the round and in the context  of  all  the  other  evidence
      before me.  Given  my  findings  concerning  the  credibility  of  the
      appellant and her account  I  do  not  find  the  appellant's  account
      credible regarding her detention. I conclude that these injuries  were
      not inflicted in the circumstances claimed.




 XII. In respect of risk on return the appellant was able to leave Sri Lanka
      undeterred in a matter of days after her release by  the  authorities.
      If the authorities in Sri Lanka were  indeed  seeking  to  detain  and
      interrogate political opponents and those suspected  of  destabilising
      the country she would not have been allowed access  to  a  lawyer  not
      released on the payment of a bribe. On the evidence she could not have
      represented  any   risk   the   authorities   otherwise,   given   the
      sophisticated intelligence methods adopted by the CID  in  particular,
      the appellant would have been on a watch list and would not have  been
      allowed to leave the country.




XIII. The appellant has not remained of interest or is likely to  remain  of
      interest to the authorities on return. Her evidence that  her  parents
      and the family  home  had  been  contacted  on  several  occasions  by
      individuals who asked about her whereabouts is not supported by cogent
      evidence.




 XIV. Taking into account the country guidance case of GG and others  (post-
      Civil War: returnees) Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]  UKUT  00319  (IAC)   the
      appellant does not, on the evidence, fall into any category that would
      place her at risk. There is no political connection by  her  with  the
      Tamil diaspora in the United Kingdom which might be of interest to the
      authorities. She identifies herself with category seven of the country
      guidance case namely, as an individual perceived to be a threat to the
      integrity of Sri Lanka that by her former actions she would have  been
      perceived as having a significant role in  relation  to  post-conflict
      separatism is not made out on the evidence. I also do  not  find  that
      she will stand out as being of interest because of  the  scarring  and
      the circumstances of her release from detention.  She  will  also  not
      likely to be on or have appeared in a computerised list accessible  at
      the airport.

The grounds of appeal

4. The appellant in her grounds of  appeal  states  the  following  which  I
   summarise. The Judge's adverse assessment of credibility relevant to  the
   issues of risk under the refugee  Convention  is  based,  as  it  is,  on
   reasons that are themselves  untenable  in  the  law  for  the  following
   reasons. The approach to the  medical  report  of  Dr  Martin  is  flawed
   because the First-tier Tribunal  materially  erred  by  failing  to  have
   proper regard to the evidence positive to the appellant's credibility. In
   the case of KV scarring medical evidence  Sri  Lanka  [2014]  UKUt  00230
   (IAC). The Judge, in requiring the appellant to establish a claim and  to
   produce evidence that proved incontrovertibly that her account was  true.
   The appellant was only required to produce evidence establishing that her
   account was reasonably likely.

   The hearing

5. At the hearing Mr Muquit pointed out  that  the  Judge  at  paragraph  19
   stated that the burden of proof is on the lower civil standard of  proof.
   He conceded that the Judge did apply  the  correct  burden  in  the  same
   paragraph. At paragraph 21 it was pointed out that the Judge's  statement
   that the appellant may have been of interest to the LTTE.

6. Mr Whitwell in his submissions said that he cannot rely on  the  Rule  24
   response because a sentence  has  strayed  into  the  response  which  is
   clearly based on cut-and-paste. He stated that the Judge at paragraph  21
   stated that on the balance may have but this does  not  include  a  legal
   test. He said that the Judge was entitled to find that the medical report
   was neutral and it does not assist the decision maker. The  Judge  stated
   that there would have been other explanations for the  injuries  and  had
   looked at the medical evidence in the round.

7. Mr Muquit in reply stated that there is no doubt that the  Judge  applied
   both the correct and the incorrect burden of proof and sometimes  in  the
   same paragraph. In respect of the medical evidence, the  Judge  found  at
   paragraph 28 states "the medical report concerning her injuries does  not
   provide convertible evidence that  the  injuries  could  have  only  been
   sustained as a result of torture".

8. This is a misdirection of law and it is not for the appellant to  provide
   incontrovertible  evidence  in  an  asylum  claim.  The  judge  therefore
   materially erred in law by failing to apply the correct burden  of  proof
   in the determination and especially to the medical evidence.

   Decision on the error of law

   9. The Judge  when  he  stated  that  the  appellant  has  not  "provided
      inconvertible proof" that the injuries were sustained  in  the  manner
      that she claims, fell into material error. It is not for the appellant
      to prove her case with inconvertible  proof  but  to  prove  it  on  a
      balance of probabilities. The Judge fell into material  error  in  his
      analysis of the medical report.

10. I therefore set aside the determination and that the appeal be  remitted
   to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing. I direct that the  appeal
   be listed before any Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, other  than  Judge
   Oscar del Fabbro on the first available date.

DECISION

The appeal be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal




     Dated this 13th day of July 2015

Mrs S Chana
