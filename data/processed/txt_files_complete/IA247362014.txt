                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent, to whom I shall refer as the Applicant, is a citizen of
    C�te d'Ivoire born on 10 January 1973.  On 9 June 2003 she married Jean-
    Philip Serele.  She had three children by him born in  2006,  2009  and
    2010.  On 11 March 2014 the Decree Absolute dissolving  their  marriage
    was pronounced. The Applicant stated her ex-husband was the  father  of
    her eldest child in the United Kingdom.  No details  of  paternity  are
    given in the birth certificates of the two younger children.  Her claim
    is that the marriage had broken down in 2007.

 2.  The  Applicant  had  previously  made  applications  for  a  permanent
    residence card under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 as  amended
    (the 2006 Regs) on 4  October  2011  and  19  July  2012.   Both  these
    applications were refused.  A further application was made on 28  April
    2014 leading to the decision under appeal dated 30 May 2014.  Her three
    children similarly applied and were refused residence cards on the same
    day.  It would appear that only the Applicant lodged notice  of  appeal
    under Regulation 26 of the 2006 Regs and Section 82 of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended.  A  copy  of  the  bio-data
    page from the C�te d'Ivoire passport of each of the children  has  been
    filed.  There is no evidence that any of them hold an EEA nationality.

 3. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal refer to the length of
    the Applicant's marriage, the exercise of Treaty rights by  her  former
    husband, the duration  of  the  marriage  and  to  the  2006  Regs  and
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and Appendix FM  as  well  as
    Article 8 of the European Convention.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

 4. By a decision promulgated on 27 February 2015, Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Quinn allowed the Applicant's  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules (not under the 2006 Regs)  and  on  human  rights  grounds  under
    Article 8.

 5. The Appellant (the SSHD) sought permission to appeal on the basis  that
    the Judge had no jurisdiction to allow the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules and that as the appeal was allowed under the 2006 Regs the  Judge
    should not have allowed the appeal  on  human  rights  grounds.   These
    grounds were made by reference to another appeal which had  been  heard
    in the Upper Tribunal, the decision on which had yet to be  promulgated
    which it was said would address the question  how  judges  should  deal
    with grounds of appeal based on Article 8  raised  in  appeals  against
    decisions made under the 2006 Regs.

 6. On 28 April 2015, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer  granted  the
    SSHD permission to appeal on both issues.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 7. The Applicant attended the hearing.  At the start Mr  Avery  sought  an
    adjournment on the basis that the decision following the recently heard
    case about the relevance of claims under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention to appeals  under  the  2006  Regs  was  anticipated  to  be
    promulgated very shortly and referred to in the preceding paragraph.

 8. Mrs Clarke for the Applicant opposed the application on  the  basis  of
    the length of time the Applicant's children  had  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom and that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  considered  the
    position in the light of HS (EEA: revocation and retained rights) Syria
    [2011] UKUT 00165 (IAC).  She continued that the  current  practice  of
    Judges in the First-tier Tribunal was that some did address  Article  8
    issues in appeals under the 2006 Regs and others  did  not.   The  SSHD
    grounds for appeal had not argued there was a material error of law  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge on the Article  8  issue,
    just that the Judge should not have considered the Article 8 appeal.

 9. I then had a discussion with the  advocates  in  chambers  in  which  I
    expressed certain concerns about the First-tier Tribunal's decision and
    the position of the Applicant who had not filed evidence about her  ex-
    husband's employment at the date of her Decree Absolute.   On  resuming
    the hearing, I explained the position to  the  Applicant  and  that  my
    decision was that the First-tier Tribunal's decision did contain errors
    of law and that I would remit it for hearing afresh in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  I went on to explain the workings of Section 40  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007 which might be relevant in  establishing  whether  the
    Applicant's husband was a qualified person within the  meaning  of  the
    2006 Regs at the date of her Decree Absolute.

Reasons

10. I now give reasons for my decision.

11. The starting point is that this is an  appeal  against  refusal  of  an
    application made under the 2006 Regs.  There is no  provision  enabling
    the decision on application made under the 2006 Regs to  be  considered
    by way of reference to the Immigration Rules  except  in  very  limited
    circumstances such as Regulation 8(4)  none of which  have  application
    to this appeal.  Consequently, it was a material error of law to  allow
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

12. The SSHD had stated the requirements which the Applicant had to  fulfil
    to comply with Regulation 10(5) of the 2006 Regs for a  retained  right
    of residence.  She had also gone on in the top of the  second  page  of
    the Reasons for Refusal Letter to set out the  additional  requirements
    for permanent residence.  Also on page 2 of the Reasons Letter the SSHD
    had made it clear what evidence was needed to show the Applicant's  ex-
    husband was exercising Treaty rights at the time of  the  divorce.   In
    those circumstances the Judge erred at paragraph 49  of  her  decision.
    She erred at paragraph 50 in finding that the Applicant's eldest  child
    was a British citizen for which there is no evidence in  the  file  and
    for which the reasons given by the Judge are not a correct statement of
    the law.

13.  There  was  no  evidence  that  the  child  was  an  EEA  citizen  and
    consequently the conclusions drawn at paragraph 51 are also an error of
    law.

14. The consideration  of  the  claim  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention, whether or not it should have  been  conducted,  is  wholly
    deficient in that it fails to adopt the five-step structure endorsed in
    R (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.  The  Judge  failed  to  give  proper
    consideration to the  interests  of  the  children,  having  regard  to
    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

15. For all these reasons, I found that the decision  contained  errors  of
    law and it would be appropriate for the matter to be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

Future conduct of the appeal

16. Having regard to the nature of the errors of law, no  findings  can  be
    preserved from the First-tier Tribunal  decision.  The  scheme  of  the
    Tribunal's, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  does  not  assign  the
    function of primary fact-finding to the Upper Tribunal.

17. Section 12(2) of the 2007 Act permits the appeal to be remitted to  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  with  directions.  Having  regard   to   Practice
    Statement 7.2(b) by the Senior President and the nature and  extent  of
    the fact-finding required  I  conclude  that  the  decision  should  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

Anonymity

18. There was no request for an anonymity direction and, having  heard  the
    appeal, I consider none is warranted.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal determination contained  errors
    of law such that it must be set aside in its entirety.  The  appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh before  a  Judge
    other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Quinn.

    No anonymity direction is made.
