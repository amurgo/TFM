                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss E King, Counsel, instructed by Rahman & Company
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   For reasons given in an earlier determination we  have  set  aside  the
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  decision  in  one  limited  but  material
    respect, namely as to the question of whether or not Miss Ivanova,  the
    appellant's sponsor, is an EEA national exercising treaty rights  as  a
    worker.

2.   Having set that part of the  decision  aside  we  are  now  invited  to
    remake it.  We are content to do so, on the basis of the  evidence  and
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  below,  and  the  additional
    material now placed before us.   We  take  into  account  the  material
    before the judge below, her findings so far as material and undisturbed
    by our earlier determination and the new documentation available to  us
    including :

    (a)  A letter  from  a  recruitment  agency  of  today's  date  in  the
         following terms :


             "Please accept this letter as confirmation that Ilona  Ivanova
             has worked for us since 11 December and is currently still  on
             an ongoing assignment."


         That  certification  is  signed  by  David  Joyner,  an  operations
             director;

    (b)  Payslips up to 12 December 2014, that is to say up to  last  week,
         showing earnings and a national insurance number; and


    (c)  Bank account details up to  12  December  2014  showing  the  sums
         recorded in the payslips going into Miss Ivanova's account.

3.   On the basis of these matters, we  are  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the appellant has established now that Miss  Ivanova
    is an EEA national exercising treaty rights as  a  worker.   For  those
    reasons we allow this appeal.


Signed :                                Date : 5 January 2015


The Honourable Mrs Justice Carr

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Before the First-tier Judge no fee award was made  because  the  appeal  has
been  dismissed.   In  light  of  this  Tribunal's  decision  the  following
decision is  substituted.   The  appeal  has  been  allowed  both  upon  the
material before the original Tribunal and more recent material  but  in  any
event a fee was paid of ï¿½140  and  in  the  light  of  the  outcome  of  the
decision today it is appropriate for a fee award  to  be  made  against  the
respondent.

No anonymity order was requested nor is necessary.


Signed                                  Date 7 January 2015

The Honourable Mrs Justice Carr
