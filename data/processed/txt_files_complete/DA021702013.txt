Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Malik, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Although the Secretary of  State  is  the  appellant  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal we shall continue to refer to Mr  Exewu-Ago  as  the  appellant
    herein.


 2. This is a rehearing of the appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of
    the respondent made on 30 September 2013 that Section 32(5)  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007 applies to him. A deportation  order  was  also  signed
    against the appellant on the same date.


3.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born in 15  September  1985.   On
    16 April 2012 the appellant was convicted at Woolwich  Crown  Court  of
    domestic burglary and sentenced to six years'  imprisonment.   This  is
    the offence that triggered the decision to deport him.

4.   Prior to the offence that led to the deportation order,  the  appellant
    had other convictions.  On 19 November 2009 he was convicted of  common
    assault at Woolwich Magistrates' Court and was sentenced to a community
    order of 60 hours unpaid work.  He was also asked to  pay  compensation
    of �100 and costs of �180.  On 19  August  2010  he  was  convicted  of
    possession  of  cannabis  resin  class  B,  possession  of   a   bladed
    article/knife in a public place and given a community  order  sentence,
    costs of �105 and  a  curfew  of  three  months  and  tagging.   On  20
    September 2010 he was convicted of possession of class A  and  class  B
    cannabis resin drugs.  He was sentenced to a  community  order  of  100
    hours unpaid work and asked to pay costs of �55.

5.   The appellant appealed the respondent's decision on the basis  that  it
    comes  within  the  exceptions  to  automatic  deportation  in  Section
    33(2)(a) of the 2007 Act, that of  a  person  whose  removal  from  the
    United Kingdom would breach obligations under Article 8  of  the  ECHR.
    He  claimed  that  his  deportation   would   be   a   disproportionate
    interference with his right to a family life with his parents, brothers
    and sisters in the UK and his private life on the basis of  his  mental
    health.

6.   On 13 July 2014 the appellant's appeal  was  allowed  by  a  First-tier
    Tribunal consisting of Judge Plumptre and Mrs J Holt.

7.   In a decision  promulgated  on  14  October  2014  the  Upper  Tribunal
    consisting of Upper Tribunal Judges Eshun and O'Connor found  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had made an error of law for the reasons set out in
    their  decision.   The  error  meant  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision could not stand.  We set it aside in order to remake it.  Thus
    the appeal came before us on 24 November 2014.

8.   The  appellant  was  found  guilty  of  "entering  the  property  as  a
    trespasser with intent to inflict really serious harm", but  that  when
    he did so, he did not have a weapon.  The appellant denied entering the
    property and making threats and asserted that he had a  bottle  in  his
    hand in the garden to the property because he  was  drinking  from  it.
    The judge said the proper approach to the jury's verdict  is  not  that
    the bottle was never  a  weapon  but  rather  that  the  appellant  was
    carrying it as a weapon but did not enter as a trespasser  until  after
    he had smashed the bottle so that he was no longer carrying it  at  the
    point of entry.  The judge said there  were  many  serious  aggravating
    factors in this case.  The first was that the occupiers were  at  home,
    two women who may not have been the most vulnerable, but who  presented
    no threat to the appellant whatsoever, as well as two children,  one  a
    young baby.   Secondly,  both  women  were  clearly  terrified  by  the
    appellant's threats, not only to Mrs Spencer's son but they also feared
    for their own safety.  The judge had no doubt that the two  women  were
    traumatised by the whole incident.  Thirdly the appellant threatened to
    kill Michael.  He also  threatened  to  come  back  again  if  anything
    happened to his brother.  Fourthly, the  appellant  took  a  deliberate
    decision to go looking for Michael at his home, indicating a degree  of
    premeditation.  Fifth he was carrying a weapon, a glass  bottle  hidden
    down the front of his trousers which he produced and smashed such  that
    it could easily have been used to  inflict  serious  injury  or  worse.
    Finally, the appellant had been drinking alcohol, seriously  increasing
    the  risk  of  potential  harm  to  others.   A  further,  but   modest
    aggravating factor was that  he  had  previous  conviction  for  common
    assault and possession of a bladed  article,  although  those  offences
    were not nearly as serious as the present one.

9.   The sentencing judge considered a report by Dr  Cumming,  a  Consultant
    Forensic Psychiatrist who concluded that the appellant did  not  suffer
    from any mental illness.  The appellant's  reports  of  hearing  voices
    were inconsistent, not  in  keeping  with  a  mental  illness  and  not
    consistent with objective, day-to-day observations of his behaviour  at
    the prison.  The appellant claims to have been  seen  by  his  GP  over
    these symptoms and to have been in  hospital  after  suffering  a  head
    injury were not substantiated by  any  of  his  medical  records.   The
    suggestion was that his claims were a deliberate attempt to avoid being
    detained in the main prison as opposed to the healthcare facility.  The
    judge noted there was a minor incident of self harm  and  that  on  one
    occasion, a ligature was found in the appellant's cell.  The  appellant
    claimed he might be able to stop the voices if he used it.  However, in
    the light of all the other evidence, the judge did not  consider  these
    incidents were genuine.  What was  clear  was  that  no  mental  health
    issues played any part in the commission of the index offence, rational
    violent response to his brother being stabbed.

10.  The sentencing judge was in no doubt that this offence fell within  the
    most serious category of the sentencing guidelines  and  sentenced  the
    appellant to six years imprisonment.

11.  The First-tier Tribunal had before them the report of  Dr  Ian  Cumming
    prepared for the Woolwich Crown Court before sentence and a psychiatric
    report prepared by  Dr  Seena  Fazel  at  the  request  of  City  Legal
    Partnership.

12.  The unchallenged findings of fact which were  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal were as follows:

13.  The appellant comes from a dysfunctional family which  is  unsurprising
    given that his parents left their children in order to come to  the  UK
    in 1988 when the appellant was aged 3 or 4 years  and  then  apparently
    did not see him again until he entered  the  United  Kingdom  with  his
    siblings in December 2006 when he was 21.

14.  It was apparent from the oral evidence particularly of his mother  that
    she had little or no insight into the appellant's condition,  and  that
    although his father had some greater insight, the medical records  from
    the GP seen by Dr Cumming and Dr Fazel both make it clear that  he  was
    never taken to his GP to be seen for reasons of  mental  ill-treatment-
    health.  Whilst the Tribunal accepted that it was difficult to make  an
    adult young man attend a doctor, if he did not  want  to,  and  perhaps
    understandably given the  separation  of  the  family,  little  if  any
    efforts had been  made  by  his  parents  to  obtain  adequate  medical
    treatment for the appellant which the Tribunal found in part based on a
    misunderstanding of western medicine and what treatment was  available.
    The Tribunal also  accepted  that  sadly  all  too  credible  that  the
    appellant would have been treated by a local doctor and given herbs  in
    Nigeria.

15.  The sad reality is that the  appellant  did  not  receive  any  medical
    diagnosis until he entered the prison regime and even then it was  some
    eight months  before  he  was  first  sent  to  the  Crofton  Unit  for
    assessment after he was remanded in custody on 2 December 2011.

16.  Again perhaps unsurprisingly  his  parents  had  at  best  visited  the
    appellant once in hospital and his father a further time when he was in
    the Crofton Psychiatric Unit.  The  Tribunal  found  that  it  was  his
    siblings who have visited him, particularly his twin  brother  Blessing
    who visited him on average twice a month throughout his  incarceration.



17.  In summary the Tribunal found that any impact on his  parents  were  he
    to be removed to Nigeria would be minimal and possibly a relief to them
    given that they have done  so  little  for  their  son,  although  they
    accepted that he has lived with both his parents since his  arrival  in
    the UK in 2006.  However it was clear from a number of reports that the
    appellant spent a period of time in  hospital  apparently  for  a  head
    injury to which none of his family made any reference at all, not  even
    his twin brother Blessing.

18.  The Tribunal  accepted  the  oral  evidence  of  the  appellant's  twin
    brother that he assisted him both with job searches, during  interviews
    and any problems arising from his employment thereafter whether due  to
    behavioural problems or question marks over  his  permission  to  work.
    Therefore despite an ultimate diagnosis of a schizoaffective  disorder,
    the appellant has successfully been able to hold down a number of  jobs
    in the UK between 2006 and 2011.

19.  The Tribunal also found  that  the  Presenting  Officer  was  right  to
    stress that all witnesses were to  some  extent  untruthful  about  the
    family situation in Nigeria and particularly the appellant's father who
    belatedly conceded that he had spent some two  and  a  half  months  in
    Nigeria in  the  last  year  visiting  school  friends.   The  Tribunal
    rejected the oral evidence that the family is sufficiently  callous  to
    make no financial provision at all for the last remaining sibling Hanna
    in Nigeria who has no fixed home address but is able to somehow sustain
    herself and three children either by living with friends or  presumably
    by irregular work.  The Tribunal found that Hanna is not  as  destitute
    as the family would have them believe, even though they  accepted  that
    the other siblings, having entered the UK as teenagers or  near  adults
    have clearly experienced difficulties in adjusting to life  in  the  UK
    and with the exception of Blessing who has achieved educational but not
    yet professional success, are largely in low-level jobs in  which  they
    struggle to sustain themselves.  This also applies to  the  appellant's
    parents.

20.  We recite as this  stage  the  Tribunal's  record  of  the  psychiatric
    evidence as it formed the basis of Mr. Malik's submissions to us.

         Dr. Cumming's report

         "61. ... It is clear from paragraphs 3-5 that the appellant did not
             always give accurate  details  about  his  family,  where  his
             siblings were born and the age of  his  father.   It  is  also
             apparent from paragraph 8 that there appear to be  no  records
             of attendance in respect of mental health complaints  although
             he had attended for a gunshot wound in August 2010.   It  also
             appears from paragraph 9 that the appellant  was  in  hospital
             for around two-three months or possibly two weeks  in  respect
             of a head  injury  (although  none  of  his  family  made  any
             reference to this).

         62.  It  is  clear  from  the  paragraphs  8-10  relating  to  past
             psychiatric history that the appellant made several references
             to hearing voices, sometimes at  work  and  sometimes  in  the
             park.

         63.  In relation to the offence of burglary, it is clear  that  the
             appellant told Dr Cumming that he had drunk but was  not  sure
             how much and that he had been  working  for  the  UK  mail  in
             Dartford.  A witness had told him who was responsible for  the
             stabbing of his twin brother so he went to his home  with  the
             intention of informing the boy's mother what he had done.   He
             had been drinking alcohol  which  he  clarified  as  beer  and
             estimated he had drunk around three bottles of beer between  5
             p.m. and the offence committed at 8 p.m.  He  had  gone  to  a
             home in Slade Green, a woman had answered.  The appellant  had
             told her he was looking for Michael.  The woman had  told  him
             Michael used to live there but not any more.   He  had  argued
             with the woman because he was drunk and left  a  bottle  which
             the appellant said was smashed.  He left to go  home  and  was
             arrested at the airport.  He had seen Michael  in  prison  and
             Michael had written to him.  He had given these letters to his
             barrister.  Dr Cumming records the account of the offence from
             the probation report which indicated  that  he  had  pulled  a
             bottle out of his trousers and smashed on the front door.

         64.  On his arrival  in  custody  the  appellant  reported  hearing
             voices which made him do things that shocked  him  afterwards.
             This included jumping out of a window  and  also  cutting  his
             arm.  Whilst at the police station voices had told him to  eat
             tissue paper.

         65.  At an interview  with  Dr  Cumming  on  5  December  2011  the
             appellant had told him he had not had any formal contact  with
             mental health services but he  had  seen  his  GP  around  six
             months ago when he complained of hearing voices.  He had  been
             put on medication for six months but admitted to not taking it
             and not knowing what it was.  The appellant had begun  hearing
             voices around two years ago and included telling him  to  harm
             himself.  He described a male  voice  as  telling  him  to  do
             things he did not want to do such as jumping off  the  balcony
             but had been stopped by his brother.

         66.  Dr Cumming had seen notes from his GP.  There was no  evidence
             of attendance to see his GP over mental health symptoms.   The
             appellant was then discharged to the  main  prison  and  there
             were no entries until 20 April 2012  when  the  appellant  had
             reported to a nurse that he was seeing ghosts in his cell.  He
             had thereafter slept with the light  on  which  disturbed  his
             cellmates.  He would bang his head on the  wall  when  hearing
             voices and was seen to lie on the floor and bang his  head  on
             the floor.  Hence he was admitted again  to  the  health  care
             centre.

         67.  After this admission he saw Dr Fazel  on  23  April  2012  who
             reported  that  he  had  heard  voices  when  he  missed   his
             grandparents and after the  death  of  his  grandmother.   The
             appellant had said that he had a brother who had mental health
             problems in Nigeria.  He had claimed that  his  family  wanted
             him to see a mental health professional but  he  kept  running
             away.  He was noted to be vague, spoke in  a  low  volume  but
             concentrated well.  He was  now  willing  to  take  medication
             although he had not wanted to in the past.

         68.  Later that day the appellant had  cut  himself  and  explained
             that he had done so as he had not been  prescribed  medication
             and had wanted an antipsychotic.  He settled but was soon seen
             to be arguing with other prisoners particularly because he put
             his light on and watched television in the early hours.

         69.  Dr Cumming reviewed the appellant on 2 May  2012  and  without
             prompting the appellant said that he was  hearing  voices  and
             introduced this into the conversation repeatedly.  He said  he
             had been found guilty of burglary but did not do it.  He  said
             that he heard voices both internally and externally who  spoke
             in English and although the appellant was  imprecise  he  said
             that he heard voices more often at night and perhaps  twice  a
             week lasting three-four hours.  He saw black ghosts  who  flew
             around the room.  Dr Cumming asked him why he had  not  sought
             help outside prison and suggested that the voices told him not
             to  seek  help.   Dr  Cumming  pointed  out   that   objective
             observations from staff did  not  support  his  claims  to  be
             hearing voices.

         70.  Although apparently settled on 23 May 2012 the  appellant  was
             much more irritable and began to scream and shout and rub  his
             face with soap.  On reporting to Dr Cumming he  said  that  he
             had heard dogs and foxes  and  had  been  seeing  ghosts.   Dr
             Cumming noted "There had been an upturn of behavioural changes
             since the appellant  had  been  informed  that  he  is  to  be
             discharged".  Dr Cumming noted that in the  several  weeks  he
             had been in the health care  centre  such  symptoms  (e.g.  of
             hearing voices) had little if any impact  on  his  functioning
             and  his  claims  are  not  supported  by  the   evidence   of
             observations by many professionals  who  had  seen  him.   The
             appellant again described voices but his description of voices
             was inconsistent and not in keeping with a mental illness.  He
             had told Officer Wicks that he was happy to  go  to  the  main
             prison but said "Am I not going to even get medication to help
             me  sleep?".   Dr  Cumming  told  the   appellant   that   the
             observations had not supported a disruptive sleep pattern  and
             he could see no need for intervention.  Dr Cumming told him he
             would be discharged to the main prison whereupon the appellant
             began to bang his door and make funny noises.  He was observed
             to pace around the cell and spat in the  face  of  the  nurse.
             Over the next few days he continued to  behave  bizarrely  and
             put toothpaste on his face and poured milk upon  himself.   He
             was subsequently restrained.

         71.  He was placed in the segregation unit for a  period  and  then
             moved  to  the  main  prison.   On  4  August  2012  he  again
             complained of hearing voices and was re-admitted to the health
             care centre.  He stated that whilst in the main prison he  had
             been moved to different cells because he did not get  on  with
             his cellmates due to voices speaking to him.  He tends to talk
             back to these voices which upset his cellmates.  The appellant
             wanted medication to help him sleep and  to  take  the  voices
             away.  It later transpired  that  the  appellant  had  had  an
             altercation with his cellmate over  allegations  that  he  had
             stolen tobacco.

         72.  The appellant saw Dr Fazel on 6 June 2012 and  made  reference
             to voices instructing him to hang himself and  that  his  head
             sometimes swelled up which he could not  control  because  the
             voices are always talking to him both upstairs and  downstairs
             as there is a lot of noise.  The appellant also said that this
             symptom did not occur outside of prison.

         73.  Dr Cumming saw him on 11 June 2012 and  asked  him  about  the
             circumstances of his  re-admission.   The  appellant  said  he
             could not cope in the  main  prison  due  to  hearing  voices.
             There is reference to the appellant talking to fruit  such  as
             apples and oranges.

         74.  In the opinion of Dr Cumming the appellant is  challenging  to
             assess and in consequence has spent  a  lengthy  time  in  the
             health  care  centre  whilst  in  custody  in  an  attempt  to
             understand the nature of his symptoms and to assess his mental
             state.

         75.  The appellant's description of his  symptoms  is  inconsistent
             and  is  not  supported  by  day-to-day   observations.    The
             appellant had claimed that he began hearing voices both  after
             the death of his grandmother and more recently  because  of  a
             car crash when he had claimed to be in  hospital  following  a
             head injury for a number of months but could not give the name
             of the hospital or ward and had also claimed that he  had  not
             informed his family (despite potentially being absent from the
             family home for a number of weeks or months).

         76.  In terms of the symptoms of hearing voices the appellant takes
             every opportunity to inform staff that he hears voices and has
             done so for a number of years but this does not explain why he
             failed to obtain help in the community.   His  description  of
             the voices varies considerably and there is  marked  variation
             in their occurrence, persistency and content.  The presence of
             such symptoms is not supported by day-to-day observations.  On
             one occasion when he was told that staff did not think he  had
             a  mental  illness  he  became  mute  and  pretended   to   be
             unresponsive.   His  description  does  not  in  Dr  Cumming's
             opinion fit with a description of auditory  hallucinations  as
             might be seen in a mental illness such as schizophrenia.  Also
             the appellant has reported seeing ghosts, walls  move,  having
             his head swell and a variety of other symptoms which  are  not
             usually seen in illnesses such as  schizophrenia.   There  are
             many other issues which are odd and unlikely (such as claiming
             not to know the name of his mother).

         77.  Dr Cumming states at paragraph 31

                  'He has been seen by a number  of  professionals  in  this
                  period in custody and there is a consensus agreement  that
                  Mr Ago does not have a mental illness.  I remain uncertain
                  as to why he would like  to  be  seen  to  have  a  mental
                  illness but I noted that recently he has had  difficulties
                  with other prisoners in the main prison  over  allegations
                  of stealing tobacco and this led to a re-admission to  the
                  health care unit.  It is possible therefore  that  he  has
                  made assertions around symptoms as a  mechanism  to  avoid
                  other issues.  In taking this into account I do  not  feel
                  that Mr Ago needs admission to hospital at this time'.

             Dr Cumming stated that the short-term objective is to  try  to
             return  the  appellant  to  the  main  prison  population  but
             acknowledged that there was some increase in risk  to  himself
             if a custodial sentence is imposed.

         78.  Dr Cumming concluded at paragraph 32 that the appellant  would
             seem  to  be  a  man  who  can  be  impulsive  and  aggressive
             particularly when alcohol is involved which seems  to  be  the
             case at the time of the offence.

         Psychiatric Report - Dr Seena Fazel

         79.  This report is at pages 3-13 SP.  This report was prepared  at
             the request of City Legal Partnerships.  Dr Fazel has seen the
             report dated 16 July 2012 prepared by Dr Ian Cumming,  another
             report dated 30  July  2012  from  Dr  Sophie  Anhoury  and  a
             psychological assessment dated 2 November 2012 from Dr Theresa
             Connolly and the discharge summary prepared by  nursing  staff
             dated 14 November 2012  dealing  with  his  admission  to  the
             Crofton Psychiatric Unit in 2012.  Dr Fazel first assessed the
             appellant in December 2012 as part of her duties as a visiting
             psychiatrist at HMP Huntercombe and  assessed  him  a  further
             five times in 2013 and twice in 2014, the last being  19  June
             2014.

         80.  Dr Fazel provides a helpful summary of what  happened  to  the
             appellant in custody at section 5  and  that  when  she  first
             assessed him in December  2012,  a  year  after  he  had  been
             remanded in custody on 2 December  2011  she  prescribed  oral
             Risperidone to which the appellant only  partially  responded.
             She changed this to another oral antipsychotic drug Quetiapine
             which had little effect  and  in  February  2014  changed  his
             medication to a depot antipsychotic drug Risperdal consta.  Dr
             Fazel noted a marked improvement  in  his  mental  state.   In
             section 6 Dr Fazel deals with her most recent  examination  on
             19 June 2014 when the appellant was dressed in clean  clothes,
             was co-operative and had good eye contact with  speech  normal
             in both rate and rhythm.  The appellant  appeared  not  to  be
             depressed or  anxious  and  denied  any  current  thoughts  of
             suicide or self harm.  There was no evidence of any perceptual
             abnormalities such as auditory or visual  hallucinations.   He
             was cognitively oriented in person, place and time and  seemed
             to have insight into the value of his current depot medication
             which he plans to take for the foreseeable future.

         81.  In the opinion of Dr Fazel she states that the appellant has a
             severe  mental  illness   which   she   characterises   as   a
             schizoaffective disorder which is a severe and enduring mental
             illness -  a  psychotic  illness  with  significant  affective
             symptoms that coincided  with  its  onset.   His  response  to
             medication supports a diagnosis of a  severe  mental  illness.
             Her impression is that this illness has been present for  some
             years and his description of the burglary is  consistent  with
             someone who is mentally unstable.

         82.  At paragraph 7.3 Dr Fazel discusses the possibility  that  the
             appellant's  symptoms  and  behaviour  have  been  feigned  or
             exaggerated as  a  way  of  influencing  the  outcome  of  any
             decisions regarding his deportation.  She is  of  the  opinion
             that the  appellant  has  probably  exaggerated  some  of  his
             symptoms at times, but his response to depot (as distinct from
             oral medication) would provide no additional gain  if  it  was
             feigned.  If anything as his release date approached Dr  Fazel
             would expect his self-reported symptoms to worsen but in  fact
             they have not.  Furthermore although he may  have  exaggerated
             his symptoms at times, that does not take away the  fact  that
             he has had symptoms and it is  not  uncommon  for  psychiatric
             patients to exaggerate symptoms if they are not receiving  the
             treatment they feel they need.

         83.  Dr Fazel recommends the continuation of depot Risperdal consta
             once a fortnight for another 18-24 months and this should only
             be decreased gradually  with  medical  supervision  if  he  is
             asymptomatic at that point.  Dr Fazel is unable  to  opine  on
             the availability  of  Risperdal  depot  in  Nigeria.   In  her
             opinion the appellant needs regular follow-up by mental health
             nurses who would administer the depot.   He  would  need  two-
             three monthly psychiatric reviews but does not currently  need
             psychiatric hospitalisation.  This package of  care  would  be
             arranged for the appellant if he were released to the UK.

         84.  Her prognosis is that if the appellant remains on his  current
             medication he  could  return  to  employment  and  independent
             living on release from prison, although it is not possible  to
             be certain.  His prognosis will worsen if  he  is  subject  to
             psychosocial  stressors  and   illegal   drugs   and   without
             medication he would relapse and his mental  state  deteriorate
             to an extent that he would be at risk to himself and others.


Submissions

21.  Mr Malik was content for the Upper Tribunal to remake the  decision  on
    the basis of the evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal.   No
    new medical evidence was submitted on behalf of the appellant.

22.  Mr Malik relied on the psychiatric evidence that was before the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  He submitted that Dr Fazel assessed the  appellant  for
    the first time in December 2012 as part of her  duties  as  a  visiting
    psychiatrist at HMP Huntercombe and assessed him a further  five  times
    in 2013 and twice in 2014.  It is recorded at paragraph 81 of the First-
    tier Tribunal's decision that in the opinion of Dr Fazel the  appellant
    has  a  severe  mental   illness   which   she   characterised   as   a
    schizoaffective disorder which is a severe and enduring mental  illness
    -  a  psychotic  illness  with  significant  affective  symptoms   that
    coincided with its onset.  Her impression was  that  this  illness  has
    been present for some years and his  description  of  the  burglary  is
    consistent with someone who is mentally unstable.

23.  Dr Fazel recommends the continuation of depot Risperdal consta  once  a
    fortnight for another eighteen to 24 month.  In the opinion of Dr Fazel
    the appellant needs regular follow-up by mental health nurses who would
    administer the depot.  He would need two to three  monthly  psychiatric
    reviews but does not currently need psychiatric hospitalisation.   This
    package of care would be arranged for the appellant if he were released
    to the UK.

24.  Mr Malik submitted that the judge found that the appellant  has  family
    life with his parents and siblings as per  the  reasoning  in  Kugathas
    given the diagnosis of a schizoaffective disorder.

25.  Mr. Malik submitted that the appellant's medical condition  amounts  to
    an exceptional circumstance.  According to the COI  Report  on  Nigeria
    dated 14 June 2013 which was re-issued  on  3  February  2014  and  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal, Nigerian hospitals  in  general  suffer
    from poor funding, a lack of qualified staff, lack of drugs and medical
    equipment and the Federal and State Governments  do  not  provide  free
    medical services.  Nigeria's mental health facilities consist of  eight
    federally funded  psychiatric  hospitals  and  six  state-owned  mental
    hospitals for a population of over 150,000 people.  Risperodine  is  an
    available mental health drug as is Quetiapine but, which  according  to
    Dr Fazel, the appellant did not respond well to.  Mr Malik said  it  is
    unclear whether the Risperdal consta depot  medication  is  or  is  not
    available in Nigeria.

26.  Mr. Malik submitted that the Upper Tribunal decision in Akhalu  (health
    claim: ECHR Article 8) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 400 (IAC))  (24  July  2013)
    has little relevance to this case.  Akhalu  had  no  leave  to  remain.
    This appellant had indefinite leave to remain.

27.  Mr Malik submitted that the appellant's offences were hideous, but  his
    medical condition makes his case exceptional and therefore it would  be
    disproportionate to deport him.  He submitted that although  paragraphs
    398 uses  the  word  "exceptional"  and  Section  117C  uses  the  word
    "compelling" to describe an appellant's circumstances, they  both  mean
    the same thing.  The appellant's circumstances have to be compelling or
    exceptional in order to outweigh the public interest in deportation.

28.  Mr Wilding submitted that this is not a case that can be  described  as
    very  compelling  over  and  above  the  circumstances   described   in
    paragraphs 398 and 399A.  He submitted that Section 117C the  amendment
    to the 2002 Act reflects the Rules in paragraph 398.  As the  appellant
    was sentenced to more than four years in prison, there will need to  be
    very compelling circumstances over and above exceptional circumstances.
     The test has to properly reflect the public interest.

29.  Mr Wilding submitted that YM (Uganda) [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1292  reflects
    the changes in the  Immigration  Rules.   These  Rules  require  strong
    public interest.  The appellant's case relies on his medical  condition
    to argue exceptional  circumstances.   Akhalu  is  a  case  on  medical
    condition which is considered through the prism of Article 8.

30.  Mr Wilding submitted that in this case  the  public  interest  is  very
    strong.  At paragraph 102 it is recorded that paragraph  26.39  of  the
    COI Report states that Risperodine is available in Nigeria.  The  judge
    did not find it credible that there was no financial support for  Hanna
    in Nigeria.  This means that the appellant would not  fall  within  the
    very compelling circumstances.  According to Akhalu  when  you  have  a
    medical case the public interest to counterbalance that must not  water
    down Article 3.  Akhalu was lawfully present in the UK  when  she  fell
    ill.  The finding was that if she returned to Nigeria  she  would  die.
    This is not the case here.

Findings

31.  The issue before us is whether in the light of all the evidence in  the
    round, including the medical evidence, and having  taken  into  account
    the preserved findings of fact made by the First-tier  Tribunal,  there
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A sufficient to outweigh the public  interest  in
    deportation in this case.

32.  In our assessment of the public  interest,  we  have  to  consider  the
    amendment by Section 19 of the 2014 Act to the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002, which inserted sections 117A-D therein.  This  new
    sections identify the public  interest  considerations  in  respect  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR. The considerations in  Section  117  mirror  the
    considerations in paragraphs 398 of the Immigration Rules.

33.  Paragraph 398 states:

         "Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary to
         the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the   Human   Rights
         Convention, and

             (a)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good and in the public  interest  because  they
                  have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

             (b)  ...

             (c)  ...

         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and  if,  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."


34.   Sections 117B and 117 C of the 2002 Act state:

         117B:
         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.


         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-


             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-


             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (4) Little weight should be given to-


             (a) a private life, or
             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that is
             established by a person at a time when the person is in the
             United Kingdom unlawfully.


         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.


         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-


             (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and
             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom.


         117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving
         foreign criminals


         (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.


         (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.


         (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies.


         (4) Exception 1 applies where-


             (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
             most of C's life,
             (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
             Kingdom, and
             (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's
             integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
             deported.


         (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.


         (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.


         (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are  to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

35.  We find that paragraph 399 does not apply  in  this  case  because  the
    appellant does not have a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
    with a child under the age of 18 who is in the UK; nor does he  have  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who is  in  the  UK.
    We note that paragraph 399A was not argued before us.

36.  Therefore, in this case we  are  considering  whether  the  appellant's
    circumstances are very compelling.

37.  We have quoted the psychiatric evidence that was before the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The appellant's  case  rests  predominantly  on  his  mental
    condition and the medication he is currently taking, the  care  package
    which it is said would not be available to him if he were  deported  to
    Nigeria.

38.  We find that the appellant's offence was  extremely  serious  and  that
    was why he was given a term of imprisonment of six years.  We find that
    Section 117C reflects the Immigration Rules in Rule 398.   There  needs
    to be very compelling circumstances.

39.  In a recent decision by the Court of Appeal in AJ (Angola) [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 16 the Court of  Appeal  stressed  the  importance  of  the  public
    interest in deportation.  The Court of Appeal held  that  the  sentence
    imposed is a clear marker of the seriousness of the  offending,  as  is
    also indicated by the UK Borders Act 2007 and the new Rules.  The Court
    of Appeal stressed the need to give  full  and  proper  weight  to  the
    public interest in  the  deportation  of  an  appellant  as  a  foreign
    criminal.  The Court of Appeal held that the Upper Tribunal should have
    approached the assessment of the claim under Article 8  by  application
    of the new Rules, and in particular  (since  the  appellant  could  not
    bring himself within paragraph 399 and 399A of the new Rules, by asking
    itself  whether  there  were  very  compelling  reasons,   within   the
    "exceptional circumstances" rubric in paragraph 398), to  outweigh  the
    strong public interest in deportation  in  the  appellant's  case.   In
    addressing that question, the Upper Tribunal should,  of  course,  have
    given due respect to the guidance from the Grand Chamber in  Maslov  at
    paragraph [75] of the judgment  (reading  it  in  the  context  of  the
    general guidance given by the Grand Chamber at paragraph  [68]-[76]  of
    the judgment) but as a matter to be weighed into the overall assessment
    and balanced against the strong public interest in deportation to which
    the UK Borders Act 2007 and the new Rules give expression.

40.  We find that the Upper Tribunal decision in Akhalu has no relevance  to
    this case.  The facts in Akhalu are very different from  the  facts  in
    this case.  Akhalu was not a foreign criminal.  After arriving  in  the
    UK as a student, she was diagnosed with end stage kidney  failure.   It
    was conceded by the Home Office Presenting Officer that she  would  not
    be able to afford the treatment she needed  in  Nigeria  and  so  would
    inevitably die.  Her medical condition was considered through the prism
    of Article 8.

41.  The appellant in the instant case had indefinite leave  to  remain  but
    is now facing deportation because he is a foreign criminal.  He is  not
    alleging and  it  has  not  been  conceded  that  without  the  medical
    treatment and care he is receiving in the UK he  would  die  if  he  is
    deported to Nigeria.  It is his case that his medical condition amounts
    to  exceptional  circumstances  and  therefore  outweighs  the   public
    interest in deporting him.  The appellant relied on the medical  report
    by Dr Fazel.

42.  Dr. Cumming came to the conclusion that the appellant  did  not  suffer
    from any mental illness. The appellant's reports of hearing voices were
    inconsistent, not in keeping with a mental illness and  not  consistent
    with objective day-to-day observations of his behaviour in prison.  His
    claims about suffering a head injury were not substantiated by  any  of
    his medical reports. Dr. Cumming concluded  that  the  appellant  would
    seem to be a man who can be impulsive and aggressive, particularly when
    alcohol is involved which seems to be the  case  at  the  time  of  the
    office.  So it is not surprising  that  the  appellant  relied  on  the
    medical report by Dr Fazel.  Her findings were in complete contrast  to
    those of Dr. Cumming.  Dr Fazel states that the appellant has a  severe
    mental illness which she characterised as a schizoaffective disorder  -
    a psychotic illness with significant affective symptoms that  coincided
    with its onset.  Her impression was that this illness has been  present
    for some years.  His description of the burglary  was  consistent  with
    someone who is mentally unstable.  She was  of  the  opinion  that  the
    appellant has probably exaggerated some of his symptoms at  times,  but
    that does not take away the fact that he has had symptoms and it is not
    uncommon for psychiatric patients to exaggerate symptoms  if  they  are
    not receiving the treatment they fell they need.   On  balance  we  are
    prepared to accept Dr. Fazel's psychiatric assessment of the appellant.

43.   The  appellant  is  currently  dependent  on  the  medication  he   is
    prescribed  by  Dr  Fazel,  that  is  depot  antipsychotic  drugs  with
    Risperdal consta once a fortnight for another eighteen to  twenty  four
    months. Dr. Fazel said that the appellant only partially  responded  to
    Risperidone and Quetiapine had little effect on him. Dr.  Fazel  states
    that his prognosis  will  worsen  if  he  is  subject  to  psychosocial
    stressors and illegal drugs and without medication he would relapse and
    his mental state would deteriorate to an extent that  he  would  be  at
    risk to himself and others.  She also said  that  the  appellant  needs
    regular follow-up by mental health  nurses  who  would  administer  the
    depot.  He would need two-three monthly psychiatric  reviews  but  does
    not currently need psychiatric hospitalisation, which is about the only
    thing she and Dr. Cumming agreed on.  Her  prognosis  is  that  if  the
    appellant  remains  on  his  current  medication  he  could  return  to
    employment and independent living on release from prison,  although  it
    is not possible to be certain.   Dr Fazel's prognosis suggests that the
    appellant is not likely to be at risk of re-offending  so  long  as  he
    remains on his current medication.

44.  We know from the COI Report that Risperidine is  available  in  Nigeria
    as well as Quetiapine.  There was no evidence from the  appellant  that
    Depot Risperdal Consta is not  available  in  Nigeria.   From  the  COI
    Report we know that there are federally  funded  psychiatric  hospitals
    and state-owned mental hospitals in Nigeria.  Therefore on the evidence
    before us we find that the appellant has not demonstrated that he would
    not be able to obtain the medication that he  requires,  or  medication
    equivalent, for his purposes, to it; and he should be  able  to  obtain
    medical treatment from any of the psychiatric hospitals in Nigeria  for
    his  mental  condition.   We  do  not  know  what  Dr  Fazel  means  by
    "psychosocial stressors".  The appellant has a sister in Nigeria.   The
    Tribunal did not believe that the family in the UK were not financially
    supporting the sister.  Consequently we find that with the  support  of
    his sister and financial help from his family in the UK, the  appellant
    should be able to keep away from illegal drugs and find  employment  to
    enable him lead an independent life.

45.  Looking at all of the appellant's circumstances as a whole, and  taking
    full account of his medical condition and all that we  say  about  that
    above, the fact that he has family in the United Kingdom with  whom  he
    has a family life, and the length of the appellant's stay in the United
    Kingdom  and  the  fact  he  had  Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain   here,
    nevertheless,  the  public  interest  in  the  appellant's  removal  is
    significant, given the nature  of  his  offending  and  the  length  of
    sentence he received for it. In all the circumstances of this  case  we
    are not satisfied that there are  very  compelling  circumstances  that
    outweigh the public interest in the appellant's deportation.

46.  Accordingly we dismiss the appellant's appeal.
