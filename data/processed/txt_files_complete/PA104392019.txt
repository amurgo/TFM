                                   Between


                                    [A A]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REMITTAL


 1. Following directions in this case I have responses from  both  parties.
    The note of argument by Mr Winter is commendably clear; it is, however,
    unhelpfully and incorrectly described by Latta  and  Co  as  supporting
    only an application for permission to appeal.  The letter from the Home
    Office is confused and, in particular in paragraph 3, incomprehensible.
     It is, however, accompanied by an email stating that "the SSHD has  no
    objection to the matter being remitted to  the  FtT  for  a  'de  novo'
    hearing" (which is not suggested in the letter itself, which  seems  to
    propose a different outcome altogether).

 2. I am persuaded by Mr Winter and note that the Secretary of  State  does
    not oppose him.  I set aside the decision of Judge Farrelly  for  error
    of law.   I remit the appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and
    direct that it be decided afresh.


                                                             C.M.G. Ockelton


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
