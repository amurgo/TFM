For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of China whose date of birth is recorded  as
    23rd February 1985.  She entered the United Kingdom in February 2007 as
    the spouse of the holder of a work permit.  However  the  marriage  ran
    into difficulties and she separated from her husband.   In  March  2008
    she met Mr Lam Mui Li and a relationship developed.   In  October  2010
    she made application to the Secretary of State to vary her leave as the
    unmarried partner of Mr Li.  Meanwhile on 3rd November 2010 the  decree
    absolute in respect of her marriage was issued.

 2. On 8th November 2012 leave granted to the Appellant was to  expire.  On
    22nd October 2012, she made an in time application for indefinite leave
    to remain having regard to paragraph 295G of HC  395  as  amended.   On
    10th April 2013 and  26th  September  2013  the  Appellant  and  Mr  Li
    attended interviews with the Secretary of State.  On 11 December  2013,
    a decision was made to refuse the application.

 3. Not content with that decision, the Appellant appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. On 31st July 2014, her appeal was heard by Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Stott.  He dismissed the appeal on the  basis  that
    the Appellant was not the married partner of the individual in  respect
    of whom she had been granted leave to enter so as to join.

 4. Not content with that decision, by Notice dated  6th  August  2014  the
    Appellant made application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. On 12th January 2015 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  A  K
    Simpson granted permission.  In doing so she summarised the essence  of
    the ground upon which application was made and I can do no better  than
    repeat what is set out at paragraph 3 of the grant:

         "It is clear form the judge's reasoning in [7] and [8] that he  had
         overlooked the fact that on 8th November  2010  the  Appellant  was
         granted a two year extension of stay as the  unmarried  partner  of
         her present partner, vis-�-vis his comment that

             '...the Appellant entered this country  as  the  dependent  of
             another individual.  She therefore is no longer the  unmarried
             partner of the person  she  was  granted  permission  to  join
             initially...  Therefore she cannot satisfy the  provisions  of
             paragraph 296G'.

         However, it is arguable that  paragraph  295G(ii)  incorporates  an
         alternative interpretation i.e. either the unmarried partner of the
         person she was admitted to join OR the  unmarried  partner  of  the
         person she was granted an extension of stay to join."

 5. The error of law in this  case  arises  from  an  error  of  fact.  The
    Appellant was  granted  an  extension  of  leave  not  because  of  the
    relationship that she had with her ex-husband but  in  respect  of  the
    relationship formed whilst in the United Kingdom, with Mr Li.

 6. The Secretary of State by notice filed under Rule 24  does  not  oppose
    the application for permission to appeal but Mr Melvin goes further and
    in fact does not contest the Appellant's assertion  that  there  was  a
    material error of law.  Of course it is a matter  for  me  but  clearly
    there was a material error of law.  The error of fact has infected  the
    entire decision.

 7. It is open to me in circumstances such as this to remake  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal.  Given the  findings  that  have  otherwise
    been made in this case with respect to the nature of  the  relationship
    which exists between the Appellant and her present  partner  and  given
    that the Secretary of State was content in any event to grant leave  on
    the  basis  of  that  relationship,  it  seems  to  me  that  it  is  a
    straightforward matter of finding that the requirements  of  the  Rules
    were in fact met and that the only answer to this appeal in remaking it
    is to make it in favour of the Appellant.

Notice of Decision

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  The  decision  of  the  First-
tier Tribunal is set aside and remade such that the  appeal  to  the  First-
tier Tribunal is allowed.
