                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. By a decision promulgated on 20 July 2017 FtT Judge Mill dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on all available grounds.

 2. The appellant's application dated 4 August 2017  states  7  grounds  of
    appeal to the UT.  Permission was granted on 25 October 2017 on grounds
    1 and 3 - 7, but not on ground 2.

 3. Ground 1 complains about the FtT's findings based on  not  claiming  in
    other countries, because passing through them while mainly confined  to
    the back of lorries did not constitute a reasonable opportunity  to  do
    so.

 4. This ground is only disagreement.  The judge was not  bound  to  accept
    that the appellant was in difficulty over claiming asylum elsewhere  if
    he chose.  He was being transported at his own expense and choice.

 5. Ground 3 complains about adverse findings based on  the  appellant  not
    giving exact descriptions of leaflets he claimed to  have  distributed,
    including  their  number  and  size,  or  the  exact  period  spent  on
    distribution.

 6. The respondent had no answer to this issue.    To describe leaflets  as
    about A4 size and to describe their layout in terms of colours, without
    specifying writing or photographs,  is  hardly  a  lack  of  definition
    materially damaging to credibility (�19-22).  To describe a  period  of
    time as "late at night" and as "around 3 hours" is  hardly  a  lack  of
    definition which undermines the account  (�23-24).    The  deficiencies
    found in this aspect of the account were at a level beyond  what  might
    be expected of ordinary recall.  They verged, as put in the grounds, on
    expectation of a photographic memory for details of events and times.

 7. The respondent also acknowledged that ground 4  was  well  taken.   The
    appellant had not said at interview that he went  to  the  mountain  to
    pick up materials, but nor had he said anything inconsistent,  and  the
    respondent did not identify any question asked at interview in response
    to which this detail should  naturally  have  emerged.   There  was  no
    "significant inconsistency" (�26).

 8. Grounds 5 - 7  disagree  and  assert  absence  of  reasoning,  although
    perhaps on points of lesser force.

 9. As a whole, the grounds and submissions show that the  decision  cannot
    safely stand as a resolution of the case.

10. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

11. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

12. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Mill.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
