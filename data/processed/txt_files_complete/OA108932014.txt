Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against the  decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman dated the 2nd October 2015,  in  which
      he allowed the Claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

   Background

   2. The Claimant is a citizen of  Bangladesh  who  was  born  on  the  2nd
      January 1990.  She  is  married  to  Mr  Muhammed  Basith,  a  British
      citizen, having married him on the 20th January  2011  in  Bangladesh.
      The Claimant had applied  for  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  under
      Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and  that  application  had  been
      refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on the 10th August  2014.   The
      Claimant sought to appeal that decision to the First-tier Tribunal and
      that appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Wyman  at  Hatton
      Cross on the 16th September 2015.

   The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman

   3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman found that the Claimant's husband, her
      Sponsor was paid in cash on  a  weekly  basis  and  that  the  payslip
      confirmed that his pay was �299.08 on each occasion.  However he found
      that on 10 occasions the amount paid into the Sponsor's  bank  account
      did not reflect the wage slip and that the difference  in  every  case
      was less than �1 and on some occasions no more than 20 pence. On  some
      occasions the difference was a credit to the Sponsor's account and  on
      others the amount paid in was less than  the  actual  payslip  amount.
      The Judge found that the evidence of financial  requirements  was  set
      out under Appendix FM-SE(k) of the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  the
      Claimant had provided a number of sources of evidence of her Sponsor's
      income including his wage slips, bank statements, a  letter  from  his
      employer and from his accountant and P60s for the years  ending  April
      2013, April 2014 and April 2015 and that the P60s for the years ending
      2014 and 2015 showed that the Sponsor earned  more  than  the  minimum
      income threshold which was �18,600.  The Judge went on  to  find  that
      this was confirmed by a letter from Samee Frozen Foods Limited  and  a
      letter from  the  Sponsor's  accountant  A.K  &  Co.   The  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge went on at [32] to find that the explanation  given  as
      to why the payslips did not correlate exactly with  the  amounts  paid
      into the bank account was  credible  and  that  he  accepted  that  Mr
      Basith's father may have simply made a  mistake  in  paying  over  the
      exact amount of the wages into the bank account and that sometimes  he
      paid too much money in and sometimes he deposited too little.  However
      the Judge found that the gross amount  of  income  could  properly  be
      evidenced by the  wage  slips,  the  P60s  and  the  letter  from  the
      employers and that the  relevant  income  threshold  was  met  and  he
      therefore allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

   4. The Entry Clearance Officer has now sought to appeal that decision  to
      the Upper Tribunal.

   The Grounds of Appeal

   5. Within the Grounds of Appeal  it  is  argued,  inter  alia,  that  the
      specified evidence requirements are  comprehensively  set  out  within
      Appendix FM-SE of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  the  Claimant's
      Sponsor needed to demonstrate a gross income of at least  �18,600  per
      annum.  It is argued that only wages paid  into  a  bank  account  and
      appearing on the statements may be counted towards the Sponsor's gross
      income in accordance with the evidence of financial requirements under
      paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE.  It is argued that it is not open to
      the Judge to draw his own conclusions based on the credibility of  the
      Sponsor or other documents in the absence of the  requisite  specified
      documents and that the Sponsor is now  paid  directly  into  his  bank
      account, such that it  is  open  to  the  Claimant  to  make  a  fresh
      application based upon the correct specified evidence.  It  is  argued
      that the Judge materially erred in law and that the decision should be
      set aside.

   The Grant of Permission to Appeal

   6. Permission to appeal in this  case  had  been  granted  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Hollingworth, in which he found that an arguable  error
      of law had arisen in relation to the construction placed by the  Judge
      on the available evidence in relation to the question of  whether  the
      Immigration Rules had been fulfilled in the context of  the  provision
      of specified evidence.  Permission was granted on  the  25th  February
      2016.  It is on that basis that the case comes before me in the  Upper
      Tribunal.

   Oral Submissions

   7. Despite the appeal having been listed for 10.00am at Field  House,  15
      Breams Buildings, London, EC4A 1DZ, and Notice of Hearing having  been
      sent  out  to  the  Claimant  and  Sponsor  and   their   then   legal
      representatives Messrs Ashfield Solicitors on the 31st March 2016,  by
      12:45pm no-one had attended at the Upper Tribunal  on  behalf  of  the
      Claimant.  A letter had been sent to the Tribunal dated the 14th April
      2016 from  Ashfield  Solicitors,  indicating  that  "as  a  matter  of
      courtesy, we will wish to inform the Court that  we  will  not  be  in
      attendance at the  respective  hearing  listed  above"  and  referring
      specifically to the case of Mrs Basith and the  hearing  on  the  21st
      April 2016.  However, I wanted to ensure that time was given  for  the
      Sponsor himself or other  representatives  to  attend  at  the  appeal
      hearing on behalf of the Claimant, should he wish to do so.   However,
      in light of the non-attendance and the letter from the  solicitors,  I
      determined that it was in the interest of justice to  proceed  in  the
      absence of the Claimant's  Sponsor  or  representative,  the  Claimant
      herself being in Bangladesh.  I therefore heard  submissions  from  Mr
      Duffy on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer.

   8. Mr Duffy handed up to me a  copy  of  the  Rules  as  set  out  within
      Appendix  FM-SE,  as  at  the  date  of  the  original  decision,  the
      Immigration Directorate's instruction as at that date, together with a
      written analysis of the payslips for the Sponsor and payments into the
      bank account.  He argued that the payslips for the 1st June 2013,  the
      8th June 2013 and the 15th June 2013, all  did  not  reflect  payments
      into the bank account, but that only the last two of those would  have
      been counted under the Rules, but that therefore two payslips were not
      reflected by means of payments into the bank account.  He pointed  out
      that in respect of seven other payments into  the  bank  account,  the
      amounts paid into the bank account did not accurately reflect the  net
      wages set out on the Sponsor's payslips.  Mr  Duffy  argued  that  the
      requirements of Appendix FM-SE were mandatory  requirements  and  that
      the Judge was not able to forgive the deficiencies in respect  of  the
      specified evidence or take account of other evidence in order  to  get
      around such deficiencies.  He asked me to allow the appeal.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

   9. Paragraph A of Appendix FM-SE states specifically that "This  Appendix
      sets out the specified evidence applicants need to provide to meet the
      requirements of Rules  contained  in  Appendix  FM  and,  where  those
      requirements are also contained  in  other  Rules  including  Appendix
      Armed Forces, and unless  otherwise  stated,  the  specified  evidence
      applicants need to provide to meet the requirements of  those  Rules".
      The provision of the  requisite  specified  evidence  is  therefore  a
      mandatory requirement if an Appellant is going to be able to  persuade
      the Tribunal that the provisions of the Immigration Rules are  met  in
      respect of their Sponsor's income, and the other elements of the Rules
      that need to be proved by means of specified evidence.

  10. Pursuant to paragraph 2(c) of  Appendix  FM-SE,  in  addition  to  the
      actual payslips having been provided together with a letter  from  the
      employer under (a)  and  (b),  under  paragraph  2(c)  "personal  bank
      statements corresponding to the same  period(s)  as  the  payslips  at
      paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has been paid into an  account
      in the name of the person or in the  name  of  the  person  and  their
      partner jointly" must be submitted with the application.

  11. Therefore, where a person has been  employed  by  their  employers  at
      least six months, for the period of six months prior to  the  date  of
      application, not only must the payslips for that period  be  provided,
      but the bank statements must show that the salary has been  paid  into
      the bank account.  That is a mandatory requirement under the specified
      evidence provisions.

  12. In this case, although the wage slips for the 8th June  2013  and  the
      15th June 2013 have been provided, those wage slips did not  correlate
      with payments into the Sponsor's bank account,  and  further,  on  the
      13th June 2013, the 3rd August 2013, the 31st August  2013,  the  21st
      September 2013, the 19th October 2013, the 2nd November 2013  and  the
      16th November 2013, the  payments  into  the  Sponsor's  bank  account
      differed from the net salary seen on his wage  slip.   Although  those
      differences were less than �1 either way, the figures  still  did  not
      correlate and on some occasions less than the net wage was  paid  into
      the bank account and on other occasions more than  the  net  wage  was
      paid into the bank account.

  13.  Although under paragraph 1(n) "the gross amount of  any  cash  income
      may be countered where the person's specified bank statements show the
      net amount which relates to the gross amount shown on  their  payslips
      (or in the relevant specified evidence provided  in  addition  to  the
      specified bank  statements  in  relation  to  non-employment  income).
      Otherwise, only the net amount shown on the specified bank  statements
      may be counted".  Here, the bank statements did not  always  show  the
      net amount correlating to the gross amount shown on the payslips,  and
      therefore the  Claimant  was  not  able  to  take  advantage  of  that
      subparagraph.

  14. Further, although the Judge relied upon paragraph 1(k) that "where the
      gross (pre-tax) amount of any income cannot be properly evidenced, the
      net (post-tax) amount will  be  counted,  including  towards  a  gross
      income requirement," this is not a case in fact where  it  would  have
      been impossible for the Sponsor and Claimant to properly evidence  the
      gross amount of income, it is simply the fact that neither the net  or
      the gross amount of income was properly evidenced as a result  of  not
      all of the Sponsor's income being paid into the bank account.  In such
      circumstances, the Claimant was not  entitled  to  take  advantage  of
      paragraph 1(k) of the Immigration Rules,  as  that  paragraph  is  not
      designed simply to circumvent the specified evidence requirements, and
      does not allow a Judge, as regrettably First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman
      sought to do, to take account of other evidence in this case in  terms
      of the wage slips, the  P60s,  and  letters  from  the  employers,  to
      confirm the gross amount  of  income.   If,  the  requisite  specified
      evidence was not provided, then the appeal should have been  dismissed
      under the Immigration Rules.  It was not open to  the  Judge  to  take
      account of other evidence to prove the level of the Sponsor's  income,
      where the specified evidence requirements  were  not  satisfied.   The
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman therefore  does  reveal  a
      material error in law in this regard and his decision is set aside.

  15. I move on to re-make the decision, and in light of the fact  that  the
      Sponsor's income for the 8th June 2013 and the  15th  June  2013  wage
      slips were not paid into the bank account,  and  that  in  respect  of
      seven other wage slips the exact net amount was not paid into the bank
      account, and does not  correlate  with  the  figures  shown  therefore
      between the bank statements and the payslips, the requisite  specified
      evidence under paragraph 2(c) of Appendix FM had  not  been  provided.
      In such circumstances, the Claimant is not  able  to  prove  that  the
      financial requirements under the Immigration  Rules  are  met.   I  do
      consider that the Claimant's human rights claim has been  fully  dealt
      with under the Immigration Rules, and does not need a separate Article
      8 consideration outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  Claimant's
      appeal against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer is  thereby
      dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Wyman  does  contain  a  material
error of law and is set aside.

I re-make the decision dismissing the Claimant's appeal  against  the  Entry
Clearance Officer's decision to refuse her  entry  clearance  as  a  partner
under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.
