                            DECISION AND REASONS

      Background

1    This is MMAR's appeal against the decision of 27 August 2014 to  refuse
      to revoke a deportation  order.  Due  to  the  date  of  the  decision
      appealed against, this appeal is brought under the 'saved  provisions'
      of Part 5, Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ('NIAA 2002').
      The Tribunal  may  thus  consider  whether  the  decision  is  not  in
      accordance  with  immigration  rules  (s84(1)(a)),  otherwise  not  in
      accordance with the law (s.84(1)(e)), or contrary to s.6 Human  Rights
      Act 1998 (s.84(1)(g)).

2    This matter has been remitted  from  the  Court  of  Appeal,  and  this
      decision is to be read alongside the decision of  the  Upper  Tribunal
      dated 15 April 2019. For the avoidance of doubt,  we  shall  refer  to
      MMAR as the appellant,  and  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department  as  the  respondent.  Some  elements  of  the  appellant's
      immigration history, as set out in the decision of 15 April  2019  are
      repeated below, for the sake of clarity.

3    The appellant is a national of Pakistan. He entered the United  Kingdom
      on 25 October 2002 with entry clearance as a student  valid  until  31
      October 2005. He gained further periods  of  leave  to  remain  to  31
      October 2008, and then to 31  January  2010.  The  appellant  met  his
      partner, AT, a British national of Pakistani  heritage,  in  2005  and
      they commenced a relationship in early 2006 (witness statement  ('WS')
      AT, 5 October 2015).

4    The appellant applied for further leave to remain as a  student  on  10
      February 2010, but was refused on 19 August 2011, with an  in  country
      right of appeal. He pursued that appeal, but later withdrew it. On  20
      October 2011 the appellant was notified of his liability to removal as
      an overstayer.

5    The appellant's antecedent history is as follows, as provided in a  PNC
      printout dated 9 July 2019.  On  8  August  2005,  the  appellant  was
      convicted at Manchester  City  Magistrates  Court  of  using  a  false
      instrument, for which  he  received  a  fine  of  �650.  He  was  also
      convicted of using a vehicle whilst uninsured, for which he was  fined
      �250. On 12 October 2006 the appellant  was  convicted  at  Manchester
      City Magistrates Court of driving with no MOT and  no  insurance,  and
      resisting or obstructing a constable, for which he was fined �100.  On
      22  April  2008,  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  Manchester  City
      Magistrates Court of driving a motor vehicle with excess alcohol,  and
      was fined �145 and disqualified from driving for 12 months. On 3 March
      2009 the appellant was convicted  at  Trafford  Magistrates  Court  of
      driving whilst disqualified and with no insurance on 29 December  2008
      and  2  March  2009,  and  received  a  three-month  suspended  prison
      sentence.  On  13  July  2010  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  the
      Manchester  City  Magistrates  Court  of  failing  to  comply  with  a
      community requirement of a suspended sentence, and was imprisoned  for
      10 weeks.

6    On 30 July 2012 the appellant was convicted at  Manchester  City  Crown
      Court of fraud by abuse of position and was  sentenced  to  15  months
      imprisonment. He did not appeal against the  sentence  or  conviction.
      The details of that offence were, according  to  the  appellant,  that
      whilst  employed  by  the  Royal  Bank  of  Scotland,  he   unlawfully
      transferred monies from one bank account to others, for the benefit of
      others. He asserts that he was under duress to do so, as his  landlord
      had threatened to report the appellant to the Home Office for  working
      more hours than he was permitted  under  his  leave  to  remain  as  a
      student.

7    It is also appropriate to note that the appellant  was  also  convicted
      on  13  October  2015  in  the  Cardiff  and  the  Vale  of  Glamorgan
      Magistrates Court, for being drunk  and  disorderly  on  25  September
      2015, and was fined �150.

8    On 3 September 2012 the appellant was notified  of  his  liability  for
      deportation. A deportation order was signed on 11 September 2012. That
      decision was later revoked due to a  procedural  error,  but  a  fresh
      notice of intention to deport was  issued  on  23  October  2012.  The
      appellant completed his custodial sentence on 18  September  2012  (he
      having  been  detained  on  remand  since  February  2012,  prior   to
      conviction on 30 July 2012 - see WS of 5 October 2015,  para  31)  and
      entered immigration detention. The  appellant  claimed  asylum  on  29
      October 2012. He was released on bail on 17 December 2012. His  period
      of detention had therefore been from  February  2012  to  17  December
      2012.

9    The asylum claim was refused on 16 January 2013, on which date a  fresh
      deportation order was also signed. The appellant appealed against that
      decision, his appeal coming before Judge of the  First  tier  Tribunal
      ('FtT') Nicholson and lay panel member Mr M James on 19 February 2013.
      The appeal was dismissed in a decision dated 4 March 2013 (dates taken
      from later FtT decision of 10 December 2014).  He became appeal rights
      exhausted in relation to that appeal on 18 April 2013.

10   An application for revocation of the deportation order was received  on
      30 May 2013.

11.        Letters were issued to his solicitors regarding  the  appellant's
      failure to report.

12   The appellant was detained on 11  November  2013.  The  appellant  made
      further  representations  seeking  to  revoke  the  deportation  order
      against him.  The  appellant  informed  the  respondent  that  AT  was
      pregnant.

13   Various  other  steps  were  taking  in  the  decision-making  process,
      including refusing certain representations under paragraph 353 of  the
      immigration rules. The appellant was released  on  bail  on  23  April
      2014. The appellant had therefore been in  immigration  detention  for
      approximately 5 � months. The appellant's daughter AR was born in  May
      2014.

      The respondent's decision

14   The  respondent  ultimately  made  the  decision  of  27  August  2014,
      refusing  to  revoke  the  deportation  order.  This  represented   an
      immigration decision as then defined under s.82(k) of NIAA  2002.  The
      respondent directed herself in accordance with paragraphs 398 and  399
      of the immigration rules. The respondent accepted  at  [37]  that  the
      appellant had a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  AR,
      and accepted at [40] that it would be unduly harsh for AR to  live  in
      Pakistan, as she was a British national. However, at [41], it was  not
      accepted that it would be unduly harsh for AR to remain in the  United
      Kingdom without the appellant, who was to be deported.

15   In relation to the appellant's relationship  with  AT,  the  respondent
      appears to have accepted at [45] that the appellant was in  a  genuine
      and subsisting relationship with her, and it was accepted at [47] that
      it would be unduly harsh for her to live in Pakistan. However, it  was
      not accepted that it would be unduly harsh for AT  to  remain  in  the
      United Kingdom upon  the  appellant's  deportation.  The  respondent's
      decision letter does not come  to  any  conclusion  on  the  issue  of
      whether the appellant met the requirement of paragraph 399(b)(i), i.e.
      whether his relationship with  AT  was  formed  at  a  time  when  the
      appellant was in the UK lawfully and his immigration  status  was  not
      precarious.


      The appellant's appeal

16   The appellant appealed against the decision of  29  August  2014.  That
      appeal was initially heard by FtT Judge  Lloyd  Smith  on  4  December
      2014, resulting in a decision  of  10  December  2014  dismissing  his
      appeal. The appellant appealed against  that  decision  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge C Lane finding, in a decision dated  18
      August 2015, that Judge Lloyd Smith had erred in law in  appearing  to
      resile from certain concessions made within the respondent's decision,
      and failing to direct herself in  law  correctly  in  determining  the
      appeal. The matter was remitted to the FtT.

17   The matter therefore came before FtT  Judge  Chambers  on  17  February
      2016. By that time, appellant and AT had had a  second  daughter,  HR,
      born in December 2015.

18   The FtT made certain findings as follows  in  relation  to  the  family
      circumstances,  including  the  medical  and  emotional   difficulties
      experienced by AT during the appellant's absence in prison/detention:

      (i) AT suffered from stress and worry as a result of  the  appellant's
           behaviour, and has suffered heart palpitations as  a  result  of
           stress [24];

      (ii)    she was taking antidepressants [24];

      (iii)   there was medical evidence that  when  the  appellant  was  in
           detention, AT could not then manage [24];

      (iv)     if  the  appellant  was  removed,  AT  would  have  the  same
           difficulty coping without him [24];

      (v) 'very  serious  fears'  arose  as  to  whether  or  not  AT  could
           reasonably cope without him; the medical evidence,  historically
           seemed to confirm that [36];

      (vi)    AT has a long-standing problem of heart  palpitations  brought
           on by anxiety;  that  situation  has  and  might  again  reflect
           adversely on the interests of the children [36];

      (vii)   the interests of this largely British family had  been  better
           served when the appellant had been present than when he had  not
           been present [37];

      (viii)  it had not been suggested from any of the material before  the
           Judge that the appellant was anything other than a  good  father
           [38];

      (ix)    because of the particular problems of AT, this  was  a  family
           who required full-time support of two parents rather  than  just
           one;  a  one  parent  regime  for  the  children  had  not  been
           successful in the past and such an arrangement did not bode well
           for the future [38].

19   In the decision of this Tribunal dated 15 April 2019, the Tribunal  (of
      which Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge O'Ryan was a member)  also  referred
      to the following matter, set out in the decision of the FtT:

           "The case put on behalf of the Appellant is that  other  members
           of the wife's family would not or could not give enough  support
           when the Appellant was on remand or serving the balance  of  his
           sentence after he pleaded guilty at the Crown Court" [36].

20   The Tribunal expressed doubt  that  that  passage  of  Judge  Chambers'
      decision actually represented a clear finding of fact. It does not, as
      is clear by the first eight words of the sentence. We also  find  that
      Judge Chambers' observation that 'a one parent regime for the children
      had not been successful in the past'  does  not  stand  scrutiny;  our
      consideration of the chronology (see [9]  and  [13]  above)  discloses
      that the appellant was not detained at any time after the birth of the
      first of his child.

21   The  FtT  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal.  The  respondent  appealed
      against that decision to the Upper Tribunal. In  a  decision  dated  5
      July 2016, Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Bruce  dismissed  the  respondent's
      appeal.

22   The respondent appealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal.  In  the  judgment
      Secretary of State for the Home Department v MR (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA
      Civ 1598, given on 12 July 2018,  the  Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the
      respondent's appeal, and remitted the appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
      The Court of Appeal held that the FtT had erred in  law,  in  summary,
      in:

           (i)    conducting a free ranging enquiry as  to  proportionality
                 for  the  purposes  of   Article   8   without   any   real
                 consideration of whether the decision and the challenge was
                 in accordance with the immigration rules at all [26];

           (ii)   failing to ensure that proper weight  was  given  to  the
                 public interest in deportation [27];

           (iii)  failing to analyse for  itself  whether  the  appellant's
                 removal would be unduly harsh  for  AT  and  the  children,
                 noting 'at best' that there were very serious fears  as  to
                 whether AT would  cope  without  the  appellant,  that  the
                 interests of the family had been  better  served  when  the
                 appellant was present, and that on the basis of  the  needs
                 of  AT  and  the  best  interests  of  the  children,   the
                 revocation of a  deportation  order  was  appropriate;  the
                 court ruled that that  alone  could  not  be  construed  as
                 sufficient  consideration  of  the  factors  set   out   at
                 paragraphs  399(a)(i)(a)  and  (b)  and  (b)(ii)   of   the
                 immigration rules, and s 117C(4) of the 2002 Act [28];

           (iv)   failing to identify any very compelling features  of  the
                 case  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  public   interest   in
                 deportation in the event the deportation was not considered
                 to be unduly harsh [29];

           (v)    failing to apply s.117A-D of NIAA  2002  and  failing  to
                 take into account the consideration that the  tribunal  was
                 required to give little weight  to  a  private  life  or  a
                 relationship with a qualifying partner if established at  a
                 time when the person was in the United Kingdom  unlawfully,
                 or  to  a  private  life  established   in   the   person's
                 immigration  status   was   precarious   given   that   the
                 appellant's immigration status was precarious from the date
                 of his entry in the United  Kingdom  in  2002,  and  became
                 unlawful in October 2011; although he became engaged to  AR
                 in 2010,  his  marriage  and  the  birth  of  the  children
                 postdated his status having become unlawful [30];

           (vi)    failing  to  apply  the  correct  test  or  to  ask  the
                 appropriate questions [31].

23   The Upper Tribunal listed the appeal  for  hearing  on  15  March  2019
      (Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor, Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Ryan)
      resulting in the decision of 15 April 2019, in which the  question  of
      whether or not the decision of Judge Chambers should be set aside  was
      resolved. His decision was indeed set aside. The  Tribunal  stated  as
      follows at [34]:

           "34.  We concur with Mr Bates' submissions that  the  First-tier
           Tribunal's findings do not set out clearly what  the  nature  of
           the impact on the children, or  its  extent,  would  be  if  the
           appellant were to be deported and we further find  that  on  the
           findings of  fact  left  untouched  by  the  Court  of  Appeal's
           decision it cannot be said that the  First-tier  Tribunal  would
           have allowed the appeal. In particular,  we  are  not  satisfied
           that the First-tier Tribunal's findings of fact,  such  as  they
           are, inevitably demonstrate that it would be  unduly  harsh  for
           the children  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  without  the
           Respondent and we find that, absent the making of the errors  of
           law, the FtT might have reached a different conclusion as to the
           outcome of the appeal."


24   The matter now comes before this Tribunal,  for  rehearing.  A  further
      change of circumstances to note by the time  the  present  hearing  is
      that the appellant and AT have had a third child, a son, MR,  born  in
      December 2018.

      Findings of Judge Nicholson

25   Although the decision of  Judge  Lloyd  Smith  was  set  aside  in  the
      decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Lane, no  suggestion  was  ever  made
      that Judge Lloyd Smith had been incorrect in law in directing  herself
      at [13] that the findings of fact of Judge Nicholson in  his  decision
      of 4 March 2013 should, applying the principles in Devaseelan  v  SSHD
      [2003]  Imm  AR  1,  be  the  starting  point   for   the   Tribunal's
      consideration of the appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of  27
      August 2014.

26   It is therefore  appropriate  to  summarise  the  findings  from  Judge
      Nicholson's decision, as set out by Judge Lloyd Smith;

      (i)     although at that time (February 2013)  the  appellant  and  AT
           were not married and did not cohabit, the Tribunal proceeded  on
           the basis that they had an Article 8 family life [94];

      (ii)    the couple met in 2005 and began a relationship in 2006;  they
           had at that time never lived together; the couple  were  engaged
           in mid 2010, and at the  time  of  the  hearing  they  had  been
           engaged for over two and half years [105];

      (iii)   although when they met and began a relationship as  girlfriend
           and boyfriend, the appellant had  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
           legally, by the time they decided to  get  engaged,  he  was  an
           overstayer; to that extent they had developed their family  life
           to the next level at a time when his  right  to  remain  in  the
           United Kingdom was clearly precarious [106]:

      (iv)    there were powerful reasons weighing in favour of  deportation
           [132];

      (v)     bearing in mind the factors weighing in favour of  deportation
           and the actual nature of the family life, the decision to deport
           was proportionate [148].

      Evidence

27   In rehearing the appeal, the Tribunal has had regard to the  following:



      (i) the respondent's bundle;

      (ii)    the appellant's consolidated bundle pages 1-417;

      (ii)    the appellant's supplementary bundle, pages 418-432; and

      (iii)   the appellant's second supplementary bundle, pages 433-440.

      We shall simply refer to the appellant's material as 'the  appellant's
      bundle' ('AB'), pages 1-440.

28   We also received in evidence from Mr Bates a print  out  from  the  NHS
      website regarding Sertraline, its uses and side effects.  Although  Ms
      Benitez objected to the admission of this document, it is  a  document
      that is in the public domain, its content  should  be  treated  as  no
      surprise to the appellant and AT, who appears to  be  prescribed  that
      particular medication, and we admitted the document into  evidence  as
      being of likely assistance to the Tribunal in the determination of the
      issues in the appeal.

29   Following the conclusion of the  hearing  on  10  September  2019,  the
      Tribunal received an email from the appellant's  solicitors  at  16.34
      hrs on the same day, purporting to put the Tribunal on notice that the
      appellant had requested further medical evidence from AT's GP  in  the
      form of a further report to confirm  her  current  diagnosis,  and  to
      obtain her medical records from 2012 to date. We refer in more  detail
      below to this issue, under the heading of 'Post hearing evidence'.

     Matters in dispute

30    At  the  outset  of  the  hearing,  Mr.  Bates  confirmed   that   the
      respondent's position in relation to the appellant's British child AR,
      ie that it would be unduly harsh for her to be  expected  to  live  in
      Pakistan, was also the position adopted in respect of the  appellant's
      children HR and MR. However, Mr. Bates maintained the position that it
      would not be unduly harsh for any of the children  to  remain  in  the
      United Kingdom with AT, but without  the  appellant,  who  was  to  be
      deported.

31   Ms Benitez had provided a skeleton argument  dated  8  September  2019,
      and confirmed that the issues to be  determined  were  whether,  under
      paragraph 399(a)(b) of the rules, it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the
      children to remain in the United Kingdom without  the  appellant,  and
      under 399(b), whether it would be unduly harsh for AT to remain in the
      UK without the appellant. In the alternative, if the  requirements  of
      399(a)(b) or 399(b) were not satisfied, Ms Benitez confirmed that  she
      intended to argue that the last provision  within  paragraph  398  was
      satisfied, i.e. that where paragraphs 399 or 399A did not  apply,  the
      public interest in deportation was outweighed  by  other  factors,  as
      there were very compelling circumstances in the present case, over and
      above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A.

      Oral evidence

32   In examination in chief, the appellant adopted his  witness  statements
      within the appellant's bundle: 5 October 2015 at [5-13]; 11 April 2016
      at [16f-16h]; 6 March 2019 at [16l-16o]; 7 July 2019 at [16m-16w]; and
      3 September 2019 at [418-419].

33   The appellant stated that AT did not sleep well.  In  the  mornings  if
      she had taken a  tablet,  she  did  not  wake  up  on  time.  She  had
      difficulty in both waking and going to sleep.  The appellant  did  not
      know the names of medications taken by AT. One was for depression.  He
      had read and agreed  with  the  content  of  the  social  work  report
      contained in the appellant's bundle.

34   The appellant was cross examined by Mr. Bates. Mr. Bates asked if  AT's
      sleeping problems may be a side effect of  medication.  The  appellant
      did know. When asked if AT had asked  for  different  medication,  the
      appellant stated that he was sure that she had discussed this with her
      GP. He assumed so.

35   Mr.  Bates  asked  if  AT  had  lived  alone  when  the  appellant  had
      previously been detained. The appellant stated AT had lived  with  her
      mother and father.   Later  she  moved  to  the  flat.  The  appellant
      confirmed that he had been detained  twice,  once  when  his  criminal
      sentence had finished, in 2012, and the second time was  when  AT  was
      pregnant (i.e. in 2014). He confirmed that he had  not  been  detained
      since his wife had had children.

36   Mr. Bates asked if AT  could  live  with  her  parents.  The  appellant
      stated that her father was disabled.  Her sister was married and lived
      with her husband.  Her father was in a wheelchair.  He thought that AT
      had discussed with her parents the possibility of  living  with  them.
      AT's brother lived with his wife in AT's parents'  home.  AT's  sister
      lived with her husband in Cheadle/Hale.   AT's  parents'  home  was  3
      miles from the home he shared with AT.

37   When asked if AT suffered  from  postnatal  depression,  the  appellant
      stated that she suffered from depression, but he did not  know  if  it
      was postnatal. He said that they are dealing with this as  her  doctor
      advised them. Mr. Bates put to the appellant that  the  social  worker
      report suggested that  AT  had  postnatal  depression.  The  appellant
      repeated that although he was aware had depression, he did not know if
      it was postnatal.  Mr. Bates asked if AT still had an employer, and if
      not when had her last employment finished.  The appellant stated  that
      AT had stopped working when she had been  pregnant  with  their  first
      child AR.  When asked what AT's income was, the appellant stated  that
      he received some money from his father. AT received some  income  from
      universal credit. His father had moved to America.

38   Mr. Bates referred to the appellant's latest witness statement dated  3
      September 2019, in which he accepted that he had committed  a  further
      criminal offence, in 2015.  The appellant confirmed that that was  the
      case. Mr. Bates asked why that conviction had not  been  mentioned  by
      the appellant in the previous witness statements. The appellant stated
      that he had mentioned it to his solicitor at the time, but it had  not
      been put into the statements by the solicitor. It was a mistake by the
      solicitor. Mr. Bates asked why no correction regarding that conviction
      had been included in any statement. The appellant  stated  that  there
      were many statements, he had just slipped.

39   When asked how long AT  had  been  on  medication  for,  the  appellant
      stated it had been quite a  while.  When  asked  if  AT  had  been  on
      medication when she was working, the appellant stated  that  yes,  she
      had, for palpitations, but not for depression.  Although it had been a
      while since then, and he was not sure if  she  was  then  also  taking
      medication for depression.

40   There were no further questions in cross-examination, and there was  no
      re-examination.

41   The Tribunal asked the appellant  that  given  that  AT's  brother  and
      wife, and AT's sister and family lived reasonably close by, why  could
      AT not live with them, if necessary?  The appellant stated  that  AT's
      brother had his own life. He had no children, but he worked,  and  his
      wife worked.  AT's sister also worked and lived with her in-laws.

42   AT gave evidence. In examination  in  chief  she  adopted  her  witness
      statements as follows:  5 October 2015 at [14-16e]; 11 April  2016  at
      [16i-16k]; 6 March 2019 at [16q-16t]; 5 July 2019 at [16x-16z]; and  3
      September 2019 at [420-421].

43   AT stated that she had read the social work report and agreed with  its
      contents. When asked whether the reference in the social worker report
      to her having postnatal depression was accurate, she  stated  that  it
      was. She stated that she had been diagnosed with  it  after  her  last
      child, MR, was born in December 2018.  Ms Benitez suggested to AT that
      a letter Dr Rehman of Corkland Road Medical Practice dated 3 September
      2019 at [422] only referred to AT having  'depression',  and  did  not
      mentioned 'post-natal depression', and did AT know why the letter  did
      not mention postnatal depression? (In fact, we note  that  the  letter
      does not refer to 'depression' at all.) AT stated  that  she  had  had
      depression for some years, going back to 2012 when the  appellant  had
      been in prison. When she  had  her  child  MR  in  2018  she  had  had
      postnatal depression.

44   Asked if her depression had got worse in 2018,  AT  said  it  had,  and
      that her dose had recently been increased, in August 2019 from  50  to
      100 mg per day.  She had not been told that her treatment would be  of
      specific duration, just until she was well in herself.

45   AT was asked if it was correct, as noted in the social work  report  at
      [435] that a side effect of her medication was that it made her  sleep
      very deeply. AT confirmed  that  that  was  right  and  that  she  was
      prescribed Sertraline. She stated that she had  discussed  this  issue
      with the GP and she would be assessed again after  a  month.   AT  was
      aware that the medication made you  sleepy.  She  stated  that  before
      being prescribed antidepressants the doctor had to make sure that  she
      had someone else take care of the children.

46   When asked for information about what period(s) AT had been  prescribed
      antidepressants, she stated that this had been on and off, because  of
      her pregnancies. She had been  prescribed  another  antidepressant  in
      2014, and then came off it. She was prescribed  again  in  2015,  then
      stopped again when becoming pregnant again in 2015.  She was then  re-
      prescribed in 2015 until pregnant again in 2018, and  then  prescribed
      them again after having her  third  child.  She  had  been  prescribed
      Sertraline only since 2018.

47   The GP had told her that the maximum dose for her would 150 mg per  day
      because  she  had  young  children,  and  because  of  her  conditions
      (anxiety, sleeplessness, and  panic  attacks).   The  doctor  did  not
      advise her to be on a high dose. She would be reviewed  again  at  the
      end of September.

48   The Tribunal put to AT that the letter of 3 September 2019 did  not  in
      fact give any diagnosis of depression. AT stated  that  she  had  been
      told that she had postnatal depression.

49   Ms Benitez asked AT  about  the  document  at  [433-434]  which  was  a
      referral for cognitive behavioural therapy dated 4 September 2019. She
      was asked why the referral had been made. AT stated  that  the  doctor
      had referred her - the GP thought that she needed  further  assistance
      with her mental health, and that she needed therapy. The GP  had  said
      she did not want to put  her  on  higher  and  higher  doses.  AT  had
      attended a session on 3 September 2019. AT was asked if she  knew  why
      she was being prescribed Sertraline specifically.   She  thought  that
      this was because the GP thought it was best one for her.

50   AT was asked if the GP had mentioned any interaction between the  beta-
      blocker that AT was being prescribed, and Sertraline. AT  stated  that
      both interfered with each other. She had told her GP  she  felt  dizzy
      when she started on 100 mg. She would be reviewed in a month. She  was
      still taking propranolol at the moment.

51   In cross-examination, Mr Bates stated that he understood  that  AT  had
      been prescribed Sertraline since having her third child. When asked if
      she had ever been prescribed it in the past,  AT  said  no.  Mr  Bates
      referred AT to page [271] which was  an  extract  from  electronic  GP
      records which contained an entry for October 2014 that  she  was  then
      being prescribed Sertraline. AT stated that she did  not  recall  what
      she had been prescribed at that time, given that  it  was  five  years
      ago.  Mr Bates asked when AT had commenced taking Sertraline again. AT
      stated that this had been after December 2018.  When asked when  after
      December 2018 this  been,  AT  stated  that  this  had  been  after  a
      postnatal checkup at the end of January or early February at the  six-
      week checkup. When asked if this had not been before that,  AT  stated
      that she had not been on antidepressants during her pregnancy in  2018
      or during the other two pregnancies. Mr Bates asked  if  AT  had  been
      prescribed  any  different  antidepressant  in  2019,  prior  to  been
      prescribed Sertraline in January of February 2019. AT  said  that  she
      did not think  so.   Mr  Bates  referred  AT  to  page  [370]  of  the
      appellant's bundle  which  was  a  photocopy  of  a  prescription  for
      Citalopram dated 18 January 2019 in AT's name. AT confirmed that  this
      was an antidepressant, but that it did not work. She did not  take  it
      for long - about a month.  She recalled they were not working well  so
      Sertraline had been given to her instead.

52   Mr Bates asked AT if she had asked the GP if she  could  take  anything
      for her symptoms of  tiredness  or  any  other  side  effects  of  her
      medication. AT said that she could not -  that  those  were  just  the
      effects/side effects of her medication.  When asked if  any  treatment
      might be available if she got nausea, AT said that she would ask to be
      assessed. She stated that she had discussed the  side-effects  of  her
      medication in August this year. The GP had said that AT would get used
      to the symptoms. The GP had increased the dosage.

53   Mr Bates put the content of  paragraph  6  of  AT's  witness  statement
      dated 11 April 2016 to her, in which she  stated  that  she  had  been
      prescribed Sertraline. AT confirmed that yes, she had been  prescribed
      Sertraline at that time. This was now a few years ago, and  she  could
      not remember this was after her second child.

54   Mr Bates asked if her recent attendance for counselling  had  been  the
      first time that she had received counselling. AT confirmed  that  this
      was correct as the symptoms had worsened.  Mr Bates put the content of
      paragraph 6 of AT's witness statement dated  11  April  2016  to  her,
      where AT had stated that she had been given some  details  to  contact
      the counselling service at that  time.  AT  stated  that  because  the
      symptoms had recently worsened the GP said she needed  more  help.  AT
      accepted that she had been given details of counselling in 2016.

55   Mr Bates asked where AT's brother lived. AT stated that he  lived  with
      her parents. He was married.  Her sister was in  Manchester  as  well.
      She was married. Mr Bates asked if AT's parents could help her if  the
      appellant were deported. AT stated that her parents would not be  able
      to help to support her, and she could not ask them. Her mother  was  a
      full-time carer for her father who was disabled. AT did  not  need  to
      ask.  Mr Bates asked if  AT's  brother  could  provide  her  with  any
      assistance.  AT stated no he could not as he had a full-time job.

56   AT stated that although she was a graduate and previously worked  in  a
      fraud department for a bank, she has not been employed since the birth
      of her first child.

57   Her current income was universal credit.  AT  was  asked  if  she  knew
      what the basis of her universal credit  claim  was;  whether  she  was
      claiming any element related to incapacity, or being a lone parent. AT
      stated that the appellant was not liable for  anything.   The  benefit
      was for her and the children, and housing benefit.  Asked if  she  was
      required to look for work in order  to  obtain  universal  credit,  AT
      stated that no she was not.

58   She would like to work again but did not currently think she had it  in
      her.  She gets sick notes from her GP.

59   The Tribunal referred AT to the  content  of  the  social  work  report
      which recorded that AT had stated that it was  difficult  for  her  to
      manage the children's night-time routine due to  the  side-effects  of
      medication that she had been prescribed for postnatal depression.  She
      was asked to clarify what medication that was. AT stated that this was
      Sertraline.  Asked if AT had only had problems managing the night-time
      routine since being on Sertraline, AT said no, she  had  had  problems
      like that before, but it was worse now.  Her husband the appellant was
      needed to look after the children, as sometimes she only woke up at 11
      or 12 in the morning.

60   There were no further questions.

      Submissions

61   Mr Bates argued that the key issues  in  the  appeal  were  whether  it
      would be unduly harsh on either the children or AT for  the  appellant
      to be  removed,  and  if  not,  whether  there  were  very  compelling
      circumstances over and above those described in paragraph 399 or 399A.



62   There were no issues with the health of the children or  the  appellant
      himself. Mr Bates argued that the medical evidence in relation  to  AT
      was only partial. The detailed GP records ended in November  2014  and
      there had only been snapshots since. The assertion in the social  work
      report at [427] that AT had been prescribed medication  for  postnatal
      depression  was  not  supported  by  medical  evidence.  If  postnatal
      depression had been diagnosed, Mr Bates said that the  GP  would  have
      specifically stated so. Although the social work report asserted  that
      AT suffered from certain side effects of medication, the appellant had
      not met the burden of proof on him of demonstrating by  evidence  that
      AT was suffering from any particular side-effects and also that  there
      was no way of mitigating the side-effects of any medication.   It  was
      possible that the GP could have prescribed an alternate medication  to
      AT, which perhaps may not have been as effective in treating symptoms,
      but might have left her with fewer side-effects, enabling her to  care
      better for her children.  There was no  evidence  on  that  issue.  Mr
      Bates also argued that the NHS print out regarding the  possible  side
      effects of Sertraline did not support AT's evidence  about  the  side-
      effects said to have been caused to her.

63   Mr Bates stated that in the absence of  medical  evidence  as  to  what
      AT's medication, and its side-effects were, we should not  necessarily
      believe what AT says herself about those matters.  AT was inconsistent
      about what medication she had  taken  and  when.  She  had  also  been
      recommended to counselling previously, but only recently taken  it  up
      during the course of these proceedings.  Although  Mr  Bates  accepted
      that he had not actually put  to  AT  the  proposition  that  she  was
      exaggerating her symptoms, he stated that she would simply have denied
      it in any event.

64   Mr Bates suggested that there was  no  up-to-date  evidence  from  AT's
      family supporting any proposition that they were unable to assist her.
       There had previously  been  letters  from  the  brother,  sister  and
      parents, but it was said that there were no updating  statements  from
      them.  (This is incorrect, as we demonstrate below).

65   Although the medical evidence established that  AT  had  suffered  from
      long-term anxiety, there was no reference in the documentation to  her
      having postnatal depression. There was some suggestion  that  she  was
      affected by  the  uncertainty  of  the  appellant's  status.   If  the
      appellant's status was resolved by his removal, AT would be obliged to
      confront her new reality and some of her anxiety might be mitigated.

66   The authors of the social work report appeared to accept  what  AT  had
      stated about her circumstances at face value, in particular  regarding
      the side-effects  of  medication  and  her  suffering  from  postnatal
      depression. The social work report did not take matters any further.

67   The  difficulties  which  AT  might  experience  upon  the  appellant's
      removal would represent the levels of harshness that one would  expect
      as a consequence of such decision, as per KO (Nigeria) v Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 and  Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department v PG (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ  1213;  certain
      consequences are to be expected from removal, and  there  will  be  an
      emotional and behavioural fallout, but this would not represent  undue
      harshness.

68   There were no  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
      matters  set  out  in  paragraph  399  or  399A.   There  was  nothing
      additional present in the present case.

69   After the luncheon adjournment, Ms Benitez made submissions  on  behalf
      of the appellant. She relied on her skeleton argument, which refers at
      paragraph  17(i)-(x)  to  certain  'preserved'  findings  within   the
      decision of Judge Chambers, and makes reference at  paragraph  20(xi)-
      (xxxii) to certain items of evidence within the appellant's bundle  to
      which we make more detailed reference below.

70   Ms Benitez  referred  us  in  particular  to  the  following  items  of
      evidence as to the history of AT's health problems generally:

      (i) a letter from Dr Amy Foulds of the Corkland Road Medical  Practice
           (CRMP) regarding AT dated 18 November 2014 at [262-263];

      (ii)    a prescription for AT for Sertraline (28 tablets at  50mg  per
           day), dated 4 April 2016 at [360];

      (iii)   a form Med 3 stating  that  AT  was  unfit  for  work  due  to
           'anxiety with depression' for one month, dated 4 April  2016  at
           [359];

      (iv)    a letter from Dr Z Rehman of CRMP regarding AT dated  24  June
           2019 at [390];

      (v) a letter from Dr Z Rehman of CRMP regarding AT dated  3  September
           2019 at [422-423].

71   It was suggested  that  it  was  not  put  to  AT  that  she  had  been
      prescribed Sertraline for any reason other than for depression.

72   In support of  the  proposition  that  AT  had  'not  coped'  when  the
      appellant had previously  been  in  detention  (which,  we  note,  was
      between February 2012 to 17 December 2012, and 11 November 2013 to  23
      April 2014), Ms Benitez referred us to the following:

      (i) a reference at [294], within a list of  dates  contained  in  AT's
           electronic  GP  records,  to  her   being   seen   in   hospital
           casualty/emergency department on 6 February 2012; this was  said
           to be approximately 4 days after the appellant had been arrested
           and detained on remand for the principal offence;

      (ii)    page [295], being part of  a  referral  form  from  Manchester
           Mental Health Gateway Service,  seemingly  completed  in  August
           2012, on which is written in 'Reason for referral':  'Anxiety  +
           stress.    Physical   symptoms   -   palpitations,   micturition
           frequency. Breakdown of engagement Feb 2012  +  stress  at  work
           exacerbated';

      (iii)   page [297], being a letter from  a  Gateway  Service  Manager,
           Manchester Mental Health Gateway Service, to AT's GP,  dated  20
           August 2012 stating that the outcome of the GP's referral to the
           Service had been to refer  AT  to  The  Psychological  Wellbeing
           Practitioners Resource at  the  Self-Help  Service  for  Step  2
           Primary Care input;

      (iv)    page [303-304], being a letter  dated  16  October  2012  from
           sister Sarah Collitt, an  Arrhythmia Nurse,  at  the  Manchester
           Heart Centre , Manchester Royal Infirmary, to  AT's  GP  stating
           that AT had been referred to the rapid access arrhythmia  clinic
           on 21 September 2012; it was stated that AT had started  to  get
           palpitations in February (2012) which settled, then returned  '2
           months ago' (i.e. around August 2012);

      (v) page [307], being a further Gateway referral form from  Manchester
           Mental Health and Social  Care  Trust  stating  in  'Reason  for
           referral': 'H/O (history of) stress+  anxiety.   Fianc�  up  for
           deportation. Having palpitations, poor sleep  et  cetera.   Does
           not want medication".

73   Ms Benitez argued that AT had been feeling sedated  by  her  medication
      even  before  the  recent  increase  in  the  Sertraline  dosage.  The
      reference  to  postnatal  depression  in  the   social   work   report
      corresponded with AT having given birth, even if postnatal  depression
      was not mentioned in AT's GP records.

74   AT's description of the side effects of  Sertraline  corresponded  with
      the side-effects set out in the NHS document. Ms Benitez  refuted  any
      suggestion that AT's anxiety had been caused by  the  actions  of  the
      appellant; rather that anxiety had been contributed to by  the  family
      circumstances. (We note however that that submission is contrary to  a
      finding of Judge Chambers, as we set out at [18(i)] above;  a  finding
      which Ms Benitez sought to preserve.)  It was not the appellant's case
      that the appellant's actions had caused AT's  depression.  Ms  Benitez
      accepted that the information set out in the social  work  report  was
      mostly  self-reported  by  AT,  but  the  information  there  set  out
      corresponded with the medical evidence. There had been no challenge to
      the expertise of the social workers co-authoring the report.

75   Ms Benitez agreed that the Tribunal's observation that the  appellant's
      bundle contained medical evidence relating to 2012,  2014,  and  2016,
      and then 2019, and that the evidence from 2019 did not state what AT's
      position had been in 2017 and 2018.

76   Ms Benitez argued that there were very compelling circumstances in  the
      appeal, not simply due to the effects of the  appellant's  deportation
      on the children.  The Appellant had not been to Pakistan for 11  years
      and had no family  remaining  there.   He  would  have  difficulty  in
      integration. His offending took place in 2009, some 10 years ago.   He
      was convicted of a minor offence in 2015.  Ms  Benitez  accepted  that
      the appellant had failed to report in 2013 and was an over stayer.

77   Upon the conclusion of the hearing, we reserved our decision. It is  to
      be noted that at no point at the outset of her submissions (which  had
      been made after an hour's luncheon adjournment) or at the end  of  her
      submissions did Ms Benitez raise any procedural issue or  any  request
      for permission to rely further evidence.

      Summary of medical and other evidence regarding AT

78   The appellant relies on a variety of medical evidence that  relates  to
      AT's mental health problems. We summarise if  here,  in  chronological
      order. We have considered all of the material presented to us  in  the
      hearing. The fact  that  we  do  not  mention  in  this  decision  any
      particular item of evidence does not mean that  it  has  is  not  been
      taken into account by the Tribunal.

      14  March   2001       Letter   from   locum   Consultant   Paediatric
                       Cardiologist, to AT's GP. AT had been seen in  clinic
                       on 9 March 2001. She was still having  episodes  when
                       she felt extremely  anxious  out  shopping.  She  got
                       sweaty, panicked, her heart raced fast and  she  felt
                       faint. AT  was  reassured  her  heart  structure  and
                       function were normal. Her fast heart rate was related
                       to anxiety [264].

      7 December 2001  Letter  from  Consultant  Cardiologist  to  AT's  GP.
                       Recorded that AT had been  troubled  by  palpitations
                       for some years,  typically  occurring  when  she  was
                       nervous or anxious. Problems such as shopping,  exams
                       and heights would bring on the tachycardia.  She  was
                       generally quite an anxious person. Beta-blockers  had
                       helped her a little [266].

      17  August  2012    Entry  in  computerised   GP   records:   Problem:

      20 August 2012   Letter from Manchester Mental Health Gateway  service
                       to AT's GP following receipt of the referral of AT to
                       the Gateway Service on 17 August  2012.   Outcome  of
                       referral  was  that  it  had   been   sent   to   the
                       Psychological Well-being Practitioners at  the  Self-
                       Help Services for Step 2  Primary  Care  Input  [295,

      20 November 2013 GP letter addressed 'To whom it may concern'  setting
                       out that AT had come to see  the  GP  complaining  of
                       symptoms of anxiety and  stress.  She  was  11  weeks
                       pregnant.  She  had  been  experiencing  tension-like
                       headaches, occasional palpitations  and  difficulties
                       sleeping at night. 'All the above symptoms are due to
                       her husband being away  from  her  in  detention  and

      18 November 2014 Letter from GP Dr Amy Foulds of CRMP addressed to the
                       appellant's former solicitors  stating,  in  summary,
                       that AT was prescribed Sertraline 50 mg to  be  taken
                       once daily for her depression  on  15  October  2014.
                       She had also been prescribed an acute prescription of
                       Amitriptyline 10 mg  once  at  night  for  stress  in
                       August 2014.  AT had most recently been  seen  on  15
                       October 2014 with regards to her depression it was at
                       that point that  it  was  felt  that  AT  required  a
                       prescription of antidepressants. AT had been referred
                       to mental health services in August 2012 and February
                       2013. There were no current plans to refer her to see
                       mental health specialist at the time  of  writing  of
                       the letter.  Reference was made to the earlier letter
                       of 20 November 2013. Further:

                       '(AT's) history of depression and anxiety  which  are
                       both well documented in  her  medical  records  would
                       suggest that should her husband be deported she would
                       suffer a deterioration in the mental health with  her
                       mood becoming lower and her anxiety increasing. I  do
                       believe that her husband and his support plays a part
                       in her managing her depression."

      24 June 2019     Letter from GP Dr Z Rehman of CRMP  stating  that  AT
                       had struggled with anxiety since around  the  age  of
                       16. Historically she had tried beta-blockers and SSRI
                       medications (of which we note sertraline is  one)  to
                       try to manage her symptoms. Symptoms presented  times
                       of stress and include  palpitations,  panic  attacks,
                       poor sleep as well as some mood disturbance including
                       general low mood, fatigue and lack of motivation.  AT
                       was aware that her  anxiety  symptoms,  at  times  of
                       stress. An example would be around the  time  of  her
                       husband's twice yearly immigration hearings. In  2002
                       she was seen by the arrhythmia team at the Manchester
                       heart  centre  and  she  had  several  investigations
                       performed including echo, 24-hour ECG and an exercise
                       test. No arrhythmia was seen so  she  was  discharged
                       from clinic. It was  felt  her  episodes  of  regular
                       rapid heart rate were down to anxiety. AT was  taking
                       sertraline and beta-blocker medication to help manage
                       her symptoms.  The  doctor  had  discussed  lifestyle
                       measures  that  would  help  her  and  she  was  also
                       awaiting talking therapy  from  Manchester  Self-Help
                       services [390]

      3 September 2019 Letter from GP Dr Z Rehman of CRMP which is the  same
                       in content as the letter of 24  June  2019  but  adds
                       that AT's sertraline  dose  was  increased  in  early
                       August 2019 to help manage worsening mood and anxiety
                       symptoms. It was stated that AT had a busy  household
                       with three children, and that  if  her  husband  were
                       deported this would be  detrimental  to  AT's  mental
                       health at a  time  when  she  is  already  struggling
                       despite maximal support from her healthcare  team  as
                       she would lose her spouse who was a source  of  great
                       support.

      4 September 2019 Letter from Lindsay  Sheehan,  Cognitive  Behavioural
                       Therapist, Manchester psychological  therapy  service
                       providing that AT had attended an initial  assessment
                       on  19  August  2019  and  had  attended  her   first
                       treatment for  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  on  3
                       September 2019. AT had scored highly for symptoms  of
                       low mood and  anxiety.  AT  believed  this  had  been
                       triggered  by  ongoing  proceedings   regarding   the
                       appellant's status in the UK. AT  had  described  how
                       the stress of dealing with  the  uncertainty  of  the
                       situation over the course of the last five years  had
                       had a profound impact on day-to-day family life,  and
                       that due  to  her  difficulties  with  low  mood  and
                       anxiety, the appellant had taken on the  majority  of
                       parenting and household tasks. It was  reported  that
                       AT also experienced daily  panic  attacks,  which  AT
                       felt were  induced  by  the  stress  of  the  current
                       situation, which had restricted her ability to be out
                       in public alone and she felt unable  to  work.  There
                       were no indicators of risk to self or others or  from
                       others.

79   The appellant also relied on the  report  of  'Social  Workers  Without
      Borders' (SWWB'); written by Katy Tolman and Lauren  Wroe,  Registered
      Social Workers, and Aimee Georgeson, Reviewing Social Worker, dated 27
      June 2019. The contents may be summarised as follows.

80   The report followed an assessment visit in the family home on  15  June
      2019 lasting 1.5 hours, and it is clear that the content of the report
      is derived principally  from  the  information  given  to  the  Social
      Workers by the appellant and AT.  There  is  no  indication  that  the
      Social Workers had information from any other source (e.g. AT's GP) in
      writing the report.

81   The  report  states  that  the  couple  spoke  about  their  night-time
      routine. The appellant was responsible for putting children to bed  as
      well as waking in the night to comfort the  children  if  needed.  The
      couple stated that AT was unable to undertake this parenting task; the
      medication she was currently taking for mental health meant that  when
      she does get to sleep, she sleeps very deeply [399].

82   Observations of the children raised no  concerns  for  their  emotional
      well-being. Evidence collected for the assessment suggested  that  the
      children were not struggling with their emotional  well-being  at  the
      time [400].

83   AT reported to the social workers that she currently  had  a  diagnosis
      of postnatal depression for which she took medication. AT stated  that
      the medication can make her feel drowsy and when she was able to sleep
      she entered a deep sleep and was not easily  aroused  making  it  very
      difficult for her to care for the children's  need  during  the  night
      time without the appellant's support. AT also  reported  that  he  had
      difficulties in the morning and would often get up late, after  11  am
      making  the  appellant  responsible  for  getting  the  children   up,
      preparing  breakfast  and  taking  AR  to  school.  She  reported   to
      'sometimes' experiencing panic  attacks  at  night  time,  with  heart
      palpitations. She also took beta-blockers in order to help  with  this
      difficulty [400].

84   AT was described to be of flat effect during the assessment. The  daily
      routine was described by the appellant that he would wake AR,  prepare
      breakfast and drop her at school. Later in the morning HR  would  wake
      and he would make her breakfast. He would take HR to nursery at 12.30,
      and collect AR school at 3 pm and then HR from nursery.  The  children
      were reported to say that they enjoyed going  to  the  park  with  the
      appellant whilst the mother stayed at home. The appellant was observed
      to be actively attending to his three children,  feeding  and  holding
      MR, engaging and chatting with AR and HR, showing physical  affection,
      giving instructions and being aware of dangers, and  it  was  apparent
      that the appellant had a role in parenting his three children on a day-
      to-day basis. HR and AR were observed to verbally  interact  with  the
      appellant, jumping on him and hugging him [402].

85   AT described to the social workers that her own parents live nearby  in
      Manchester, and that the children saw them two or three times a month,
      occasionally staying for a sleepover. AT  stated  that  although  they
      maintain contact and have a good relationship with the  children,  her
      own mother's caring responsibilities for her  father  took  precedence
      and therefore their support  was  limited  with  respect  to  offering
      childcare for the children [403].

86   The social workers stated  under  the  heading  'What  are  we  worried
      about?' that were the appellant to be deported from  the  UK,  it  was
      likely to have a significant effect on the lives of three children and
      their experience of care giving. AT had stated that she would find  it
      very difficult to cope without the  appellant  parenting  support.  AT
      reported that she felt her current mental health concerns were in part
      a result of the prolonged  stresses  resulting  from  the  appellant's
      precarious immigration status. Social workers stated  that  where  the
      appellant to be deported, it was  possible  that  AT's  mental  health
      would suffer further and this would likely have a negative  impact  on
      the care afforded to the children [404].

87   At [407] the social workers summarise  their  findings  which  included
      that if the appellant were to be  deported,  AT  would  be  likely  to
      struggle to meet all her children's needs as they were currently being
      met with significant input from the  appellant.  In  addition  to  the
      appellant's responsibility for  day-to-day  activities  with  children
      including meals, school run and play time, the assessment was said  to
      have demonstrated the appellant's role in  the  children's  night-time
      routine in which he wakes to comfort MR in the night when AT does  not
      hear him cry. The appellant  was  therefore  a  protective  factor  in
      considering the impact of AT's mental health on her current  parenting
      capacity extended  family  did  not  play  a  significant  role  in  a
      parenting and the appellant's absence  would  indicate  a  significant
      loss of parenting support for AT.

88   There were no  current  concerns  with  respect  to  the  emotional  or
      behavioural development of the children;  there  was  however  a  high
      likelihood that the children would experience adverse effects on their
      emotional well-being and on the sense of their identity following  the
      deportation of their father [408].

89   There is an addendum report from SWWB dated 2 September 2019  at  [427-
      432]. The authors appear to have  been  asked  to  expand  on  certain
      elements of the original report.  They stated that there was no  doubt
      that the children's experience of care giving  will  be  significantly
      affected if the appellant were to be deported from the UK  [428].  The
      report  referred  to  academic  research  which  suggested  that   the
      prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was significantly  higher
      for children of deported parents. The authors then suggested  that  in
      the 'highly likely scenario' that the  children  displayed  behaviours
      associated with post-traumatic stress  disorder  and  early  childhood
      loss if the appellant were to be removed from their lives, AT would be
      required not only to attend daily routines of parenting alone, but  to
      the demands of emotionally harmed children. It was said that this  was
      likely  to  be  extremely  difficult  given  AT's  own  mental  health
      difficulties [429].

90   It was observed that postnatal depression did not  necessarily  predict
      inability to parent, but it was said to be crucial  that  support  was
      provided at this stage  to  scaffold  a  mother's  recovery.  Further,
      empirical data was said  to  evidence  that  children  of  women  with
      persistent postnatal depression were at increased risk  of  developing
      behavioural  problems  in  early  childhood  and   depression   during
      adolescence. It was highly likely that the appellant's  absence  would
      compound AT's experience of depression. It was said to be  vital  that
      AT receive adequate support in resolving or at least ameliorating  the
      postnatal depression and building warm relationships with her children
      to improve their emotional well-being [430].


      Post hearing evidence

91   It was a surprise to the Tribunal to be notified on 11  September  2019
      of the receipt, at 16.34 hours on 10 September 2019, of an email  from
      Mr  Tahir  Mohammed,  Consultant   Solicitor,   of   the   appellant's
      solicitors, asking for permission to obtain and file further a medical
      report on AT.

92   The full text of  his  email  is  contained  within  the  body  of  the
      directions we subsequently issued on 12 September 2019:

           "The Tribunal has received, at 4.34  pm  after  the  hearing  on
           10.9.19, an email from the (MMAR's) solicitors in the  following
           terms:

                 "We write further to today's hearing before Deputy UT Judge
                 Ryan and UT Judge Plimmer regarding the  above  matter  and
                 wish to place the Upper Tribunal on  notice  that  we  have
                 requested for  further  medical  evidence  from  (AT's)  GP
                 surgery in the form of a  further  report  to  confirm  her
                 current diagnosis and her  medical  records  from  2012  to
                 date. We anticipate receiving the documents within the next
                 5-10 working days. Upon receipt of the said  documents,  we
                 will be seeking directions for both parties to make further
                 submissions in writing should they deem it necessary.


                 We believe that the Upper Tribunal will  be  assisted  with
                 the  above  documents  in  view  of  today's  hearing   and
                 therefore we would be grateful if permission is granted for
                 the above stated documents to be filed."

           The Tribunal notes that no application for an adjournment of the
           appeal was made by (MMAR's) Counsel at the hearing  for  further
           evidence to be adduced, and no indication was given  before  the
           hearing  concluded  of  any  wish  to  file  and  serve  further
           evidence.

           The Tribunal hereby directs that:

                 (i) (MMAR's) Solicitors shall, by 4.00pm 12.9.19, file  and
                 serve a properly prepared application  to  file  and  serve
                 post-hearing evidence, addressing SD  (treatment  of  post-
                 hearing evidence) Russia [2008] UKAIT 00037, and any  other
                 relevant authority.

                 (ii) The Secretary of State shall by 4.00 pm  13.9.19  file
                 and  serve  any  representations  by  way  of  response  to
                 (MMAR's) application.

           The Tribunal shall  thereafter  rule,  prior  to  receiving  any
           further evidence, as  to  whether  any  further  time  shall  be
           permitted prior to promulgation of  the  decision,  for  further
           evidence to be filed and served."

93   Even before receipt of that direction, Mr Bates for the respondent  had
      on 11 September 2019,  in  response  to  receipt  of  the  appellant's
      request by email  of  10  September  2018,  written  to  the  Tribunal
      expressing his surprise that the appellant proposed to adduce  further
      medical evidence. Mr Bates requested that  in  the  event  that  post-
      hearing material was admitted into evidence, he be permitted  to  make
      further submissions in relation to the same.

94   In response to  the  Tribunal's  directions,  the  appellant  filed  an
      application on 12 September 2019 on form T484 for 'An  order  to  file
      and serve  a  detailed  medical  report  from  Corkland  Road  Medical
      Practice, and (AT's) medical notes by 3 October 2019'. The application
      made passing reference to SD Russia and also to Kabir v The  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 1162. The submissions
      made in the application are, in summary, as follows:

           (i)    fresh evidence would impact on the outcome of the appeal,
                 and failure  to  admit  the  evidence  would  risk  serious
                 injustice;

           (ii)   there had been an unexpected  challenge  to  the  medical
                 diagnosis previously accepted;

           (iii)  the proposed evidence would come from a  credible  source
                 and would further confirm the diagnosis and  the  treatment
                 that AT been receiving;

           (iv)   notwithstanding a 'preserved finding' at paragraph 32  of
                 the Upper Tribunal's decision 15 April  2019  that  AT  had
                 been taking antidepressants, there was a suggestion at  the
                 hearing that AT's medication may have been  prescribed  for
                 panic attack as opposed to depression;

           (v)    the appellant had overlooked the fact that the GP  report
                 dated 3 September 2019 did not  specifically  confirm  AT's
                 diagnosis, but the appellant could not have  foreseen  that
                 the  Tribunal  and  the  respondent  would  challenge   the
                 evidence,  in so far as the Upper  Tribunal  had  preserved
                 findings in respect  of  AT's  health,  in  particular  her
                 diagnosis of depression;

           (vi)    the  appellant  had  followed  due  diligence   in   the
                 preparation of the appeal, but due to the course  that  the
                 proceedings took, the appellant wished  to  obtain  written
                 evidence confirming AT's diagnosis of postnatal  depression
                 and/or depression.

95    By  way  of  formal  response  to  the  appellant's  application,  the
      respondent provided submissions dated 13 September 2019  opposing  the
      admittance into evidence of any new material  post  hearing,  for  the
      following reasons, in summary:

           (i)    the respondent at no  point  accepted  any  diagnosis  of
                 postnatal depression, which appeared to  have  been  raised
                 only in the independent social  work  report  and  was  not
                 corroborated by medical evidence or by the appellant or  AT
                 in their witness statements;

           (ii)   the respondent did  not  per  se  challenge  the  general
                 assertion of depression; the respondent's case was that the
                 medical evidence did not  support  a  conclusion  of  undue
                 harshness; the respondent had, by  reliance  upon  the  NHS
                 background evidence on Sertraline,  made  clear  that  AT's
                 assertions as to the maximum permitted dosage of Sertraline
                 and as to its side effects were being challenged;

           (iii)  the respondent observed that it  had  been  the  Tribunal
                 itself which had made the observation in the  hearing  that
                 Sertraline  was  also  prescribed  for  panic  attacks;   a
                 condition that AT was also  experiencing;  the  appellant's
                 Counsel had the opportunity to deal with  this  by  way  of
                 submissions after lunch;

           (iv)   the  respondent  had  challenged  in  oral  evidence  and
                 submissions the quality and extent of the medical  evidence
                 and noted that in essence, better evidence could and should
                 have  been  adduced  for  the  hearing;  the  post  hearing
                 application was no more than a veiled acknowledgement  that
                 the evidence relied upon was deficient by way  of  lack  of
                 due diligence;

           (v)    the factual matrix of the case and its procedural history
                 bore little relation to that in Kabir v SSHD;

           (vi)   the test in SD Russia was not met.

96   The Tribunal did not make a positive  decision  to  await  any  further
      evidence from the appellant; rather, further time  passed  before  the
      Tribunal was able to complete its decision in the matter.

97   On 10 October 2019, the Tribunal received a copy of a letter from Dr  Z
      Rehman of CRMP dated 2 October 2019 relating to  AT,  plus  copies  of
      electronic records relating to  AT  from  CRMP,  which  we  note  were
      printed on  24  September  2019.  The  letter  confirms  that  AT  was
      prescribed Sertraline from October 2014 for the management of  stress-
      related symptoms. There were no symptoms of low mood at that time.  In
      April 2016 AT was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and  she  had
      been reviewed on a regular basis since that time. It was  the  opinion
      of the GP that AT had been  struggling  with  anxiety  and  depression
      uninterrupted since April 2016.

98   Further, it was stated that AT had a postnatal review  on  18.1.19  and
      reported worsening anxiety, mood and palpitations towards the  end  of
      the pregnancy. Citalopram had been commenced for one month.  Follow-up
      in May 2019 had revealed that AT's symptoms were worsening.  Lifestyle
      advice, beta-blockers, sertraline and  a  referral  to  CBT  were  all
      discussed. Dr  Rehman  stated  that  as  the  symptoms  of  depression
      worsened in late pregnancy and after delivery of the child, she  would
      diagnose this as a postnatal depression. Sertraline was  increased  to
      100 mg in August 2019 due to a flat effect and little  improvement  in
      symptoms. The maximum dose of sertraline was said to be 200 mg. AT was
      said to be struggling from deep sleep and fatigue symptoms as a  side-
      effect of her medication. It was stated that in  some  patients  side-
      effects do subside however if they still persist at 6 to 8 weeks  than
      they are likely to remain persistent. Side-effects of  antidepressants
      can limit the maximum dose that can be used. It was stated that  there
      were  no  medications  to  counter  these  effects.  When  there   are
      limitations in the ability to increase medication doses, the  practice
      focuses more holistically and  tries  to  make  lifestyle  changes  to
      reduce life stressors, and talking therapies are also recommended.

99   The letter concluded:

           "I have no concerns about  (AT's)  current  ability  to  parent.
           However, I am aware that her husband takes a big  share  of  the
           day-to-day childcare duties. If (MMAR)  were  deported,  clearly
           this would cause great  upheaval  for  the  family.  (AT)  would
           effectively become a single parent and would need to take on all
           childcare duties of  her  three  young  children  herself.  They
           themselves will be greatly affected  by  the  change  in  family
           dynamics and will likely require more support and attention. She
           would also lose the  emotional  support  from  her  husband  and
           become relatively isolated.  I  understand  that  she  has  some
           family nearby but they are involved in their own lives and  have
           limited capacity to  help.  Even  just  talking  about  (MMAR's)
           potential deportation causes such anguish for (AT), it is almost
           certain (AT's) mental health will deteriorate if  this  were  to
           happen."

100  The Tribunal noted that in the first line of the last paragraph of  the
      letter, Dr Rehman provides that: "I  have  no  concerns  about  (TA's)
      current ability to parent."

101  An email from Mr Tahir Mohammed of the appellant's solicitors dated  10
      October 2019 states as follows:

           "Dear Sirs
           We write in order to update the Upper Tribunal  in  relation  to
           our email and application lodged on 12 September 2019 as  below.
           We confirm that (AT's) medical records and medical  report  were
           provided to us on 8 October 2019.

           Unfortunately, there is an administrative error made  by  (AT's)
           GP in the medical report and we have therefore requested for  Dr
           Rehman to correct the error. Dr Rehman does not  work  full-time
           at  (CRMP)  therefore  we  are  unable  to  provide  a  specific
           timescale of when the revised report will be ready,  however  we
           have requested for the report to be provided urgently  and  will
           attempt to obtain information about an estimated timescale  from
           the GP surgery. We will update all parties accordingly.  In  the
           interim, we have attached the medical records and medical report
           provided to our client."

102  On 17 October 2019, a further email was  received  by  the  appellant's
      solicitors with an amended report from Dr Rehman, now dated 15 October
      2019. The appellant's solicitors email stated as follows:

           "We write further to our email below and  our  letter  dated  11
           October 2019 enclosing hard copies of documents  emailed  on  10
           October 2019. We  have  today  received  the  corrected  medical
           report and attach the  same.  We  request  that  the  additional
           evidence  is  considered  as   outlined   in   our   uncontested
           application of 12 September 2019."

103  Upon considering Dr Rehman's amended letter dated 15 October 2019,  the
      Tribunal notes that the only material change to Dr Rehman's letter was
      to omit the sentence 'I have  no  concerns  about  (TA's)  ability  to
      parent'. The Tribunal issued directions as follows  on  or  around  23
      October 2019:

           "UPON considering the Appellant's application  of  12  September
           2019 to file and serve a further medical  report  from  Corkland
           Road Medical Practice ('CRMP'), plus medical notes

           AND UPON receipt from the Appellant on 10 October 2019 a  letter
           from Dr Z Rehman of CRMP dated  2  October  2019,  plus  medical
           notes, and noting that  the  email  to  the  Tribunal  from  the
           Appellant's  solicitor  of   10   October   2019   stated   that
           "Unfortunately, there is an administrative error made by  (AT's)
           GP in the medical report and we have therefore requested for  Dr
           Rehman to correct the error."

           AND UPON receipt  from  the  Appellant  on  17  October  2019  a
           'corrected medical report' from Dr Rehman dated 15 October 2019

           AND UPON the Tribunal noting that the 'correction' in the report
           is to delete the words 'I have no concerns about (AT's)  current
           ability to parent. However ..." in the last paragraph

           AND UPON the Tribunal  noting,  aside  from  the  suggestion  in
           correspondence of 10 October 2019 that Dr Rehman's first  letter
           contained  an  'administrative  error',   that   there   is   no
           explanation whatever from either the  Appellant's  solicitor  or
           from Dr Rehman as to why the Doctor's report needed to  be,  and
           has been amended

           AND UPON the  Tribunal  not  yet  having  adjudicated  upon  the
           Appellant's application of 12 September 2019

           IT IS HEREBY DIRECTED THAT:

           1 The Appellant shall, by 4.00  pm  29  October  2019  file  and
           serve:

                 (i)  a witness statement from a partner of the  Appellant's
                 solicitors firm setting out the circumstances in  which  Dr
                 Rehman's letters of 2 October 2019 and 15 October 2019 were
                 procured, exhibiting  all  letters  of  instruction  to  Dr
                 Rehman,  including  any  letter  sent  to  Dr   Rehman   to
                 facilitate compliance of paragraph 1(ii) of this direction,
                 below;

                 (ii)  a written  explanation  from  Dr  Rehman  as  to  the
                 reasons for the amendment of his letter;


                 (iii) any further  submissions  upon  which  the  Appellant
                 seeks  to  rely,  in  support  of  its  application  of  12
                 September 2019, and, in the event that the Tribunal decides
                 to admit any further evidence submitted after  the  hearing
                 of  10  September  2019,  making  any  further  substantive
                 submissions he wishes to make, limited to  such  additional
                 evidence.

           2 The Respondent shall by 4.00 pm 4 November 2019 file and serve
           any further submissions upon which she seeks  to  rely,  on  the
           admissibility of any of the material produced since the hearing,
           and in the event that the Tribunal decides to admit any  further
           evidence submitted after  the  hearing  of  10  September  2019,
           making any further substantive submissions he  wishes  to  make,
           limited to such additional evidence.

           3 The Appellant shall provide a copy of  this  direction  to  Dr
           Rehman."

104  The appellant requested further time to  comply  with  that  direction,
      resulting in a  further  direction  being  issued  to  the  appellant.
      Ultimately, on 1.11.19 the appellant provided a witness statement from
      Mr  Muhammod  Nurol  Islam,  director  and  solicitor  on  behalf  the
      appellant's solicitors setting out  the  sequence  of  events  whereby
      Tahir Mohammed had further corresponded with CRMP in  relation  to  Dr
      Rehman's letter of 2.10.19. It was apparent  that  on  10.10.19  Tahir
      Mohammed had written to CRMP suggesting that  the  letter  of  2.10.19
      contained 'administrative errors' and stated  'we  would  request  for
      corrections to be made in the first sentence of  the  last  paragraph,
      and there are minor spelling errors.' Mr Islam stated in  his  witness
      statement  that  this  action  had  been  brought  about  because  the
      appellant himself had attended the solicitor's office on  8.10.19  and
      had asserted that the  doctor's  report  contained  an  administrative
      error as it was alleged that the GP had made it clear to AT  that  the
      GP 'had concerns'. This resulted in the  amended  letter  of  15.10.19
      from Dr Rehman.

105  The appellant's correspondence of 1.11.19 also included a final  letter
      from Dr Rehman dated 24 October 2019 which stated:

           "A report was written to Fisher Day Solicitors on 2nd  Oct  2019
           to give some background into (AT's) mental health. I was alerted
           to a repeated spelling error regarding  (MMAR's)  name  so  this
           report was amended on 15 October 2019  to  correct  this  error.
           While amending this report I choose to remove a  short  sentence
           from the final paragraph which  commented  on  AT's  ability  to
           parent. I choose to do this as on reflection I do not feel in  a
           position to comment on this as her GP."

106  Mr Bates has, on 5.11.19, made final submissions opposing admission  of
      the post hearing evidence, and in the  alternative,  setting  out  the
      respondent's position with regard  to  that  evidence,  asserting,  in
      summary, that the relevant test of undue hardship is still not met.

           be considered in the light of all  the  circumstances  including
           the following:

                 (i) the grounds on which the order was made;
                 (ii) any representations made in support of revocation;
                 (iii)  the  interests  of  the  community,  including   the
                 maintenance of an effective immigration control;
                 (iv)  the  interests  of  the  applicant,   including   any
                 compassionate circumstances.

           390A. Where paragraph 398 applies the Secretary  of  State  will
           consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if  it  does
           not, it will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the
           public interest in maintaining the  deportation  order  will  be
           outweighed by other factors.

           ...
           398. Where a person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
           contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8  of  the  Human
           Rights Convention, and

                 (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is  conducive
                 to the public good and in the public interest because  they
                 have been convicted of an offence for which they have  been
                 sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

                 (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is  conducive
                 to the public good and in the public interest because  they
                 have been convicted of an offence for which they have  been
                 sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than 4  years
                 but at least 12 months; or

                 (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is  conducive
                 to the public good and in the public interest  because,  in
                 the view of the Secretary of  State,  their  offending  has
                 caused serious harm or they are a persistent  offender  who
                 shows a particular disregard for the law, the Secretary  of
                 State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider   whether
                 paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
                 public interest in deportation will only be  outweighed  by
                 other factors where there are very compelling circumstances
                 over and above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
           if -

                 (a) the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                 relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who  is
                 in the UK, and

                       (i) the child is a British Citizen; or
                       (ii) the child has lived in the UK  continuously  for
                       at least the 7 years immediately preceding  the  date
                       of the immigration decision; and in either case

                            (a) it would be unduly harsh for the  child  to
                            live in the country to which the person  is  to
                            be deported; and
                            (b) it would be unduly harsh for the  child  to
                            remain in the UK without the person who  is  to
                            be deported; or

                 (b) the person has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
                 with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or
                 settled in the UK, and

                       (i) the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the
                       person (deportee) was in the UK  lawfully  and  their
                       immigration status was not precarious; and
                       (ii) it would be unduly harsh  for  that  partner  to
                       live in the country to which  the  person  is  to  be
                       deported, because of  compelling  circumstances  over
                       and above  those  described  in  paragraph  EX.2.  of
                       Appendix FM; and
                       (iii) it would be unduly harsh for  that  partner  to
                       remain in the UK without the  person  who  is  to  be
                       deported.

           399A. This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
           applies if -

                 (a) the person has been lawfully resident  in  the  UK  for
                 most of his life; and
                 (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
                 (c) there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
                 integration into the country to which it is proposed he  is
                 deported."

108  NIAA 2002:

           "Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations
           117AApplication of this Part
           (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
                 (a) breaches a person's right to respect  for  private  and
                 family life under Article 8, and
                 (b) as a result would be unlawful under section  6  of  the
                 Human Rights Act 1998.
           (2) In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
                 (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed  in  section
                 117B, and
                 (b)  in  cases  concerning  the  deportation   of   foreign
                 criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.
           (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2).

           117BArticle 8: public interest considerations applicable in  all
           cases
           (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the
           public interest.
           (2) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
                 (a)are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.
           (3) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-
                 (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.
           (4) Little weight should be given to-
                 (a) a private life, or
                 (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying  partner,  that
                 is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
                 the United Kingdom unlawfully.
           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established
           by a person at a time when the person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.
           (6) In the case of a person who is not  liable  to  deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-
                 (a) the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                 relationship with a qualifying child, and
                 (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
                 the United Kingdom.

           117CArticle 8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
           foreign criminals
           (1) The deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
           interest.
           (2)  The  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in  deportation  of
           the criminal.
           (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C")  who  has  not  been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception  1  or
           Exception 2 applies.
           (4) Exception 1 applies where-
                 (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  for
                 most of C's life,
                 (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in  the  United
                 Kingdom, and
                 (c) there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                 integration into the country to which C is proposed  to  be
                 deported.
           (5) Exception 2 applies where C has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
           relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
           subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child,  and
           the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child  would  be
           unduly harsh.
           (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to
           a period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
           interest requires deportation unless there are  very  compelling
           circumstances, over and above those described  in  Exceptions  1
           and 2.
           (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
           into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision
           to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the  reason
           for the decision was the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
           criminal has been convicted."

      Relevant authority


109  KO (Nigeria) & Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      (Respondent) [2018] UKSC 53:

           "22.  Given that exception 1  is  self-contained,  it  would  be
           surprising to find exception 2 structured in a different way. On
           its face it raises a factual issue seen from the point  of  view
           of the partner or child: would the effect of C's deportation  be
           "unduly harsh"? Although the language is  perhaps  less  precise
           than that of exception 1, there is nothing to suggest  that  the
           word "unduly" is intended as a reference back to  the  issue  of
           relative  seriousness  introduced  by   subsection   (2).   Like
           exception 1, and like the test of "reasonableness" under section
           117B, exception 2 appears self-contained.

           23. On the  other  hand  the  expression  "unduly  harsh"  seems
           clearly intended to introduce  a  higher  hurdle  than  that  of
           "reasonableness" under section 117B(6), taking  account  of  the
           public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. Further
           the word "unduly" implies an element of comparison.  It  assumes
           that there is a "due" level of  "harshness",  that  is  a  level
           which may be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant  context.
           "Unduly" implies something going beyond that level. The relevant
           context is that set by  section  117C(1),  that  is  the  public
           interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. One is looking
           for a degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be
           involved for any child faced with the deportation of  a  parent.
           What it does  not  require  in  my  view  (and  subject  to  the
           discussion of the cases in the next section) is a  balancing  of
           relative levels of severity of the parent's offence, other  than
           is inherent in the distinction drawn by the  section  itself  by
           reference to length of sentence. Nor (contrary to  the  view  of
           the Court of Appeal in IT (Jamaica) v Secretary of State for the
           Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 932, [2017] 1 WLR 240, paras 55,
           64)  can  it  be  equated  with  a  requirement  to  show  "very
           compelling reasons". That would be in effect  to  replicate  the
           additional test applied  by  section  117C(6)  with  respect  to
           sentences of four years or more."

110  SD (treatment of post-hearing  evidence)  Russia  [2008]  UKAIT  00037:
      headnote:

           "In the rare case where  an  immigration  judge,  prior  to  the
           promulgation of a determination, receives a submission  of  late
           evidence,  then  consideration  must  first  be  given  to   the
           principles in Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489. Under those,  a
           tribunal should not normally  admit  fresh  evidence  unless  it
           could not have been previously obtained with due  diligence  for
           use at the trial, would probably have had an important influence
           on the result and was apparently  credible.  If,  applying  that
           test, the judge was  satisfied  there  was  a  risk  of  serious
           injustice because of something  which  had  gone  wrong  at  the
           hearing or this was evidence that had been overlooked,  then  it
           was likely to be material. In those circumstances,  it  will  be
           necessary either to reconvene  the  hearing  or  to  obtain  the
           written submissions of the other side in relation to the matters
           included in the late submission."



      Directions in law


111  We direct ourselves that it is for the  appellant  to  establish  on  a
      balance of probabilities that he meets the immigration rules  relevant
      to the revocation of a deportation order. Outside of  the  immigration
      rules, as it is accepted that the appellant has  established  that  he
      has engaged the provision of Article 8(1) ECHR, by  establishing  that
      he has a family life in United Kingdom, it is for  the  respondent  to
      justify  any  interference  with  such  right.  When   assessing   the
      proportionality  of  any  such  interference,  we   must   apply   the
      considerations set out in Part 5A of NIAA 2002.  In particular we must
      determine whether the high thresholds required in ss. 117C(5) and  (6)
      of the 2002 Act are met in this case.

      Discussion

      Ruling on the appellant's application of 12 September 2019

112  We refuse to admit the post  hearing  evidence  including  the  further
      letters from Dr Rehman  dated  2.10.19,  15.10.19  and  24.10.19.  The
      relevant test in SD (supra) is not met.

113  The implied suggestion by the appellant in  the  application  to  admit
      further evidence that the parameters of the appeal was somehow changed
      by questions asked either by the respondent or by the Tribunal  itself
      in the course of the hearing on 10.9.19 is simply not made out.  Judge
      Chambers had  observed  in  his  decision  that  AT  was  then  taking
      antidepressants. He also noted that AT suffered from stress and  worry
      and had suffered heart palpitations. Judge Chambers did not  make  any
      finding of fact that AT had been diagnosed with depression, and  there
      was no suggestion at the relevant time that AT suffered from postnatal
      depression.

114  Where the respondent and the Tribunal have asked AT and  the  appellant
      in the course of the hearing for further information about her medical
      problems, no procedural fairness issue arose. It was readily apparent,
      and indeed it was accepted by Ms Benitez in the course of the  hearing
      on 10.9.19, that there were significant temporal gaps in  the  medical
      evidence relating to AT, and the letter of Dr Rehman dated 3.9.19 gave
      no diagnosis of either depression or postnatal depression.

115  We find that the appellant's attempts to add,  after  the  hearing,  to
      the evidence relating to AT's mental health,  represents  an  ex  post
      facto realisation that certain assertions made by the appellant and AT
      were not supported by medical evidence,  in  circumstances  where  the
      appellant could have been under no allusion that  the  issue  of  AT's
      mental health was likely to be a relevant factor in the appeal. We see
      no reason at all as to why any of the post-hearing evidence could  not
      have been adduced before the hearing on 10.9.19.

116  Given in particular the protracted history of the appeal, we find  that
      there  is  no  adequate  reason  for  the  Tribunal  to  exercise  its
      discretion to admit this evidence. It cannot properly be said that the
      material could not have been previously obtained  with  due  diligence
      for use at the hearing. Medical evidence  relating  to  AT  could,  in
      general terms, be said to be capable of having  an  influence  on  the
      result of the hearing, but the nature of the further evidence from  Dr
      Rehman, and the way in which it has been amended results in us  having
      doubt as to the weight that could be attached to the evidence  in  any
      event. We seriously question whether it was at all appropriate for the
      appellant's solicitor to suggest to Dr Rehman that a  'correction'  be
      made to the first sentence of the last paragraph of the version of the
      letter dated 2.10.19  on  the  implied  basis  that  it  contained  an
      'administrative error'. We are of the view that no  injustice  to  the
      appellant arises as a consequence of our decision to exclude the  post
      hearing evidence. The appellant has been represented at  all  material
      times in the preparation for the hearing of 10.9.19 and the choice  of
      evidence on which he relied at that hearing was his.  The  appellant's
      attempt to shore up elements of the evidence he relies upon, after the
      hearing  has  concluded,  is  to  be   deprecated,   and   has   added
      significantly  to  the  burden  on  the  Tribunal  in  producing  this
      decision, requiring no less than three sets of directions being issued
      as a consequence.

117  We have decided, nonetheless, for the sake of completeness to  consider
      whether admitting the post hearing evidence and taking it into account
      would make any difference to the outcome of the appeal.  We  therefore
      consider it in more detail below.

      Unduly harsh consequences for the children

118  It is accepted by the respondent in this appeal that  the  requirements
      of 399(a)(i) and 399(a)(i)(a)  are  met,  i.e.  that  the  appellant's
      children are British, and it will be unduly harsh for them to live  in
      Pakistan.  The  only  remaining  issue  under  399(a)  is  that  under
      399(a)(b); whether it will be unduly harsh for the children to  remain
      in the UK without the appellant. The same legal question arises  under
      'Exception 2' within s.117C(5) of NIAA 2002.

119  The consideration of that issue relates  principally  to  the  evidence
      addressing the question of AT's mental health. We have set out above a
      summary of the relevant evidence.

120  The children presently have  no  physical  or  mental  health  problems
      other than MR having a recurring cold. We take issue with the  implied
      suggestion with the addendum SWWB report at [429] that it is a  highly
      likely scenario the children will display behaviours  associated  with
      post-traumatic stress disorder if the appellant were to  be  deported.
      Even if, as the research quoted immediately before that  assertion  is
      correct, that the prevalence  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is
      significantly higher for children of  deported  parents  than  amongst
      children generally, we do not find without more that this supports the
      proposition that it is 'highly likely' that the children will  display
      behaviours associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. The  actual
      frequency of the incidence of  such  behaviours  in  the  children  of
      persons deported is not given.

121  We note that the medical evidence before the Tribunal as  at  the  date
      of hearing did not provide a current diagnosis that AT  was  suffering
      from  depression  or  specifically,  postnatal  depression,  and   the
      historical evidence of depression did  not  indicate  whether  it  was
      mild, moderate or  severe.  Further,  there  was  no  cogent  evidence
      supporting AT's assertion as to the sedative effects of any medication
      she was receiving, or whether the side-effects of any medication could
      be addressed by the GP.

122  The report from the Cognitive Behavioural Therapist  recorded  that  AT
      scored highly for symptoms of low mood and anxiety, but does not offer
      a specific diagnosis of depression or postnatal depression.

123  AT was inconsistent in her oral evidence as to  the  periods  when  she
      had been prescribed antidepressants. However, we do not treat that  as
      significant, noting that her own medical records  establish  that  she
      has been described antidepressants at different times in the past  and
      that it may be difficult for her to remember accurately what  she  was
      prescribed at any particular time.

124  We observe that AT  was  recommended  for  psychological  therapies  at
      least twice in the  past  before  her  recent  decision  to  pursue  a
      referral to psychological therapies,  resulting  in  her  consultation
      with the Cognitive Behaviour Therapist. We do not  find  that  AT  has
      given  any  cogent  reason  for  not  having  taken  up  psychological
      therapies in the past.

125  The evidence on the frequency of AT's panic  attacks  is  inconsistent.
      AT  is  reported  in  the  SWWB  report  to  have  stated  that  these
      'sometimes' occurred at night; the GP states that they occur at  times
      of stress, an example  being  around  the  times  of  the  appellant's
      immigration hearings; and the CBT  report  suggested  the  these  were
      daily.  Due to these inconsistencies, we find that AT's panic  attacks
      are not as frequent as AT had reported to the CBT therapist.

126  Notwithstanding that the medical evidence available to the Tribunal  as
      at the date of hearing did not support AT's assertion that  her  sleep
      was disturbed  as  a  result  either  of  her  depression  or  of  her
      medication, we are prepared to proceed on the basis that AT does  have
      a form of depression, and  does  experience  some  sleep  disturbance.
      However, AT herself stated in oral evidence that she  was  advised  by
      her GP in August 2019 that she would get used to her the symptoms/side
      effects of her medication (see [52] above).

127  We are also prepared to proceed  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant's
      removal from the United Kingdom will have a  'significant  effect'  on
      the lives of the children, representing a negative impact on the  care
      afforded to the children, and that AT will be likely  to  struggle  to
      meet all of the children's needs.  We are also prepared to accept  the
      opinion expressed by Dr Rehman in her letter of 3 September 2019  that
      the appellant's removal would be detrimental to AT's mental health.

128  We consider  the  best  interests  of  the  appellant's  three  British
      children as being a primary consideration in our decision  making:  ZH
      (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4.
      In the present appeal, there is no  suggestion  that  the  appellant's
      children could or should relocate to  Pakistan;  to  do  so  would  be
      unduly harsh and would clearly not be in their best interests.

129  We also find that it  would  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the
      children for them to remain in  the  UK  without  the  appellant.  The
      appellant plays a positive and important role in their lives, although
      we do not find that the appellant's continued presence in UK would  be
      exclusively  positive  for  the  children,  as  we  agree  with  Judge
      Chambers' finding as set out at [18(i)] above, that  AT  has  suffered
      from stress and worry 'as a  result  of  the  appellant's  behaviour'.
      However, as the SWWB report suggests, there is  significant  potential
      that the appellant's removal from the UK would have a negative  effect
      upon the children. It would not be in their best interests for that to
      happen.

130  When considering the potential effect of  the  appellant's  removal  on
      AT's ability to care for her children, we note that AT has always  had
      mental health problems to one degree or another, having suffered  from
      anxiety and palpitations since childhood. Although we are prepared  to
      accept that AT's mental health may have suffered at times of crisis in
      her  relationship  with  the  appellant,  and  as  a  result  of   her
      preoccupation with the  outcome  of  these  proceedings,  we  are  not
      satisfied that AT's mental health problems can be solely attributed to
      her  concerns  about  the  outcome  of  these  proceedings   and   the
      appellant's potential removal from the United Kingdom.

131  We find that there is some assistance available to AT  from  her  wider
      family. Although current assistance is said to  be  limited,  we  note
      that the children are said to see the grandparents 2-3 times a  month,
      occasionally for a sleep-over. However, AT stated  that  she  had  not
      asked her mother for any further help (para [55] above).  Further,  in
      his updating statement dated 21 June 2019, AT's brother ST states that
      although he works full-time, he  does  from  time  to  time  drop  the
      children off at school. ST lives with AT's parents. We do  not  accept
      any proposition made to the effect that no further assistance  at  all
      would be available from the wider family.  In our view AT has not been
      entirely candid about the support both she and the children  get  from
      her own family members living relatively nearby or  could  potentially
      rely upon if the appellant is deported.

132  Further, in BL  (Jamaica)  v  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2016] EWCA Civ 357, the Court of Appeal held at [53]  that
      the Upper Tribunal had erred in law in failing to consider whether, if
      a parent was struggling  to  care  their  children,  adequate  support
      services would be available for the children. 'The UT were entitled to
      work on the basis that the social services would perform their  duties
      under the law and, ...the UT was not bound in these  circumstances  to
      regard the role of the social services as irrelevant.' There has  been
      no involvement by social  services  to  assist  in  the  care  of  the
      appellant's children. It has not been demonstrated that it  would  not
      be available if necessary.

133  We find that the consequences to the appellant's children of his  being
      deported from United Kingdom will be harsh. However,  as  is  apparent
      from much of the academic research  quoted  within  the  SWWB  report,
      deportation has negative, and indeed harsh consequences  on  children.
      That is likely to be  a  given.  The  deportation  is  proposed  as  a
      consequence of the appellant having committed  a  number  of  criminal
      offences in the United Kingdom, the last  of  which  resulted  in  his
      imprisonment for 15 months.  Immigration control,  as  represented  in
      immigration rules, approved by Parliament, requires  his  deportation,
      unless the consequences to his children are not only harsh, but unduly
      harsh: 'a degree of harshness going beyond what would  necessarily  be
      involve any child faced the deportation of a parent' (KO  Nigeria).  A
      significant part of the SWWB report considers academic studies of  the
      consequences on children generally as a result of the deportation of a
      parent.

134  We find, on the basis of evidence before the Tribunal as  at  the  date
      of hearing, and taking the best interests of the children as a primary
      consideration, that the appellant has not met the  burden  on  him  to
      establish on a balance of probabilities that the consequences  to  his
      children as a result  of  his  removal  would  be  unduly  harsh.   We
      acknowledge that AT will find it difficult  to  be  a  single  parent.
      However, she has the appropriate infrastructure around her  to  assist
      her to cope: she has a good relationship with her GP  and  her  mental
      health is regularly reviewed;  she  has  started  seeing  a  Cognitive
      Behaviour Therapist; she has the nearby  support  of  her  own  family
      members.   The  children  are  all  healthy  and  do  not   have   any
      particularly demanding characteristics.  With time  and  by  accessing
      the correct support, we consider that AT and the children  will  learn
      to adapt to the changed circumstances.

135  If we had had regard to the post hearing evidence, we would  note  that
      it cast some light on certain matters that  were  not,  with  respect,
      clearly established by the evidence before the Tribunal as at the date
      of hearing, i.e. that AT should be treated as  having  struggled  with
      anxiety and depression uninterrupted since April 2016,  and  that  her
      presentation after the birth of MR has been such that the doctor would
      diagnose AT as having postnatal depression. The recent increase in the
      sertraline dose was confirmed. AT was said to be struggling from  deep
      sleep and fatigue symptoms as a side-effect  her  medication.  It  was
      said that there were no medications  to  counter  those  effects.  The
      appellant's removal would cause a great upheaval for  the  family  and
      the children will be greatly affected by the change in family dynamics
      and would likely require more support and attention.

136  However, the admission into  evidence  of  Dr  Rehman's  letters  of  2
      October 2019, 15 October 2019, and 24 October 2019 would  present  the
      appellant with a significant difficulty; that within her letter  of  2
      October 2019, Dr Rehman stated that she was not  concerned  with  AT's
      current ability to parent the children. That  assertion  significantly
      undermines the assertions of AT, the appellant, and  the  SWWB  report
      that AT presently has difficulty adequately caring for her children.

137  We have already had reason to criticise the appellant's solicitors  for
      seeking to elicit an amendment to Dr Rehman's letter of 2 October 2019
      on the spurious basis  that  it  was  said  to  contain  one  or  more
      administrative errors. We note that Dr Rehman seeks in her  letter  of
      24 October 2019 to explain the amendment to her original letter on the
      basis that she chose to make the amendment because on  reflection  she
      did not feel in a position to comment on the issue of AT's ability  to
      parent. This is, with respect, a curious position  for  Dr  Rehman  to
      take. It is not entirely clear why Dr Rehman ultimately found  herself
      unable to comment on the issue. Further, it is unexplained why, if  Dr
      Rehman finds herself unable to comment on AT's ability to  parent  her
      children at the present time, she is able in her letter of  2  October
      2019 to opine at length on AT's ability to parent her children in  the
      future.

138  Therefore, proper scrutiny of Dr Rehman's letters of  2  October  2019,
      15 October 2019, and 24 October 2019, in particular the  amendment  to
      her letter, as contained within the letter of 15 October 2019, and the
      apparent reasons for that amendment, set  out  in  the  letter  of  24
      October 2019, would result in this Tribunal placing little  weight  on
      these three letters, if they were to be admitted into evidence.

139  We therefore find that the appellant does not meet the requirements  of
      paragraph 339(b) of the immigration rules. For the  same  reasons,  we
      find that Exception 2, within s.117C(5) NIAA 2002 does not  apply,  in
      relation to the effect of the appellant's deportation on the children.

      Unduly harsh consequences for AT


140  The appellant argued that it would be unduly harsh  not  only  for  his
      children to remain in the UK without him, but also for AT. This  issue
      arises when considering the application of  paragraph  399(b)(i)-(iii)
      of the immigration rules (set out  above),  and  under  'Exception  2'
      within s.117C(5) NIAA 2002.

141  We note that whereas  paragraph  399(b)(i)  of  the  immigration  rules
      specifically requires consideration of whether a relationship  with  a
      partner in the UK was formed at a time when the deportee was in the UK
      lawfully  and  their  immigration  status  was  not  precarious,   the
      immigration status of the deportee is not specifically set  out  under
      s.117C(5) as a consideration to which Tribunal must  have  regard.  As
      per paragraph 22 of KO (Nigeria) (supra), Exception 2  appears  to  be
      self-contained.  We  therefore  focus  on  the  common  issue   within
      paragraph 399(b), and s.117C(5); whether the effect of the appellant's
       deportation would be unduly harsh on AT.

142  We adopt herein the reasons set out at [118]-[139] above as to  why  it
      would not be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the UK without
      the appellant, which we consider  to  be  equally  applicable  to  the
      question of whether it would be unduly harsh on AT for her  to  remain
      in the UK without him. We have in particular taken  into  account  her
      mental health problems. For all the  reasons  we  set  out  above,  in
      particular those at [134], we find the  appellant's  removal  will  be
      harsh on AT, but not unduly harsh. The appellant is  therefore  unable
      to satisfy the conjunctive requirements of  paragraph  399(b)(i)-(iii)
      of the rules, and does not meet  the  self-contained  requirements  of
      Exception 2 within s.117C(5) as it relates to his relationship  within
      AT.

      Very compelling circumstances; para 398

143  Ms Benitez sought to argue that the  appellant  had  been  absent  from
      Pakistan for many years and now had few ties to the country.  However,
      the appellant spent his  formative  years  in  Pakistan  and  will  be
      familiar with the culture and languages in the country. The  appellant
      has gained academic qualifications in United Kingdom during  his  stay
      here.

144  Although the nature of the appellant's offending  was  not  a  material
      consideration in our consideration as to whether the  consequences  of
      his removal would be unduly harsh on the appellant's children, it is a
      material consideration when considering under  paragraph  398  of  the
      rules, whether there are very compelling circumstances over and  above
      the factors set out in paragraph 399 of the immigration rules.

145  In his witness evidence, the appellant omits  to  discuss  his  earlier
      offences as set out at [5] above. These include an earlier offence  of
      dishonesty; using a false  instrument,  in  2005,  and  at  least  six
      driving offences, including driving no insurance, no MOT, and  driving
      with excess alcohol,  in  the  years  2005  -  2009.  The  three-month
      suspended prison sentence imposed on 3 March 2009 for  driving  whilst
      disqualified and with no insurance was activated on 13 July  2010  due
      to his failure to comply with community  requirement  of  a  suspended
      sentence, and the appellant was imprisoned for 10 weeks. The Appellant
      and AT assert that they met in 2005, and have been in  a  relationship
      since early 2006. It is to be assumed  that  AT  has  been  aware  the
      appellant's offending behaviour throughout.

146  We also find that the appellant has  intentionally  sought  to  conceal
      his further conviction of 2015. Even if, as he  asserts,  he  informed
      his solicitors that he had been convicted of a further  offence  after
      2012, and that conviction was not  specifically  set  out  within  the
      witness statements which postdate the 2015 conviction,  the  appellant
      also positively asserted in  various  witness  statements  post-dating
      that conviction that he had not been convicted of any further criminal
      offences since his conviction of 2012. This was patently not true, and
      the  appellant  is  responsible  for  the  content  of   his   witness
      statements.

147  We find that the totality of the  appellant's  offending  behaviour  is
      very significant. The driving offences are in themselves to be treated
      as being of grave concern, given that he has repeatedly driven without
      insurance, and has driven with excess alcohol. We treat the offence of
      which he was convicted in 2012 as being serious.

148  Having considered all  relevant  matters  cumulatively,  we  find  that
      there are no very compelling circumstances over and above matters  set
      out in paragraph 399  meeting  the  requirements  of  the  immigration
      rules.

149  We consider the appellant's appeal outside the  rules,  and  take  into
      account the considerations set out in  Part  5A  NIAA  2002.  We  have
      already found that the self-contained provision of Exception 2  within
      of s.117C(5)  does  not  apply).  We  find  that  the  maintenance  of
      effective immigration control is in the public  interest  (s.117B(1)).
      The appellant speaks English (s.117B(2)).  We  are  also  prepared  to
      accept, on balance,  that  the  appellant  may  be  capable  of  being
      financially independent in the United Kingdom, if the  appellant  were
      to remain in the UK and were permitted to work, as the  appellant  has
      in  the  past  been  employed  full-time  (s.117B(3)).  However,   his
      employment prospects are no  doubt  diminished  as  a  result  of  his
      offending behaviour. However, those two matters  do  not  provide  the
      appellant with a positive right to reside in the UK.

150  No submission has been advanced to us that the appellant has a  private
      life in the United Kingdom other than that associated with his  family
      life. In any event, the appellant has been  unlawfully  present  since
      2011 at the latest, and any private life developed since then is to be
      given little weight (s.117B(4)(a)).

151      We note the finding of Judge Nicholson at [109]  in  his  decision,
      as summarised at [26(iii)] above, that although when the appellant and
      AT met and began a  relationship  as  girlfriend  and  boyfriend,  the
      appellant had been in the United Kingdom lawfully, by  the  time  they
      decided to get engaged, he was an overstayer; to that extent they  had
      developed their family life to the next level at a time when his right
      to remain in the United Kingdom was clearly precarious. We agree  with
      that analysis, and we find that the appellant's family life is  to  be
      given little weight.

152  S.117B(6)  does not apply, as the appellant is liable for  deportation.


153  We note that the deportation of foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
      interest (s.177C(1)), and that  the  more  serious  the  offence,  the
      greater is the public interest in deportation (s.117C(2)). We  are  of
      the view  that  the  appellant's  offending  history  is  serious.  No
      argument that Exception 1 within s.117C(4) applies has been made.

154  We find that there are no very compelling circumstances in the  appeal.



155  We find that the appellant's removal from the United Kingdom  does  not
      represent a disproportionate interference with his  right  private  or
      family life.

      Decision


     The appellant's appeal  under  the  immigration  rules,  brought  under
      s.84(1)(a) NIAA 2002, is dismissed.

     The appellant's appeal under s.84(1)(g) NIAA 2002 is also dismissed.
