Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Slatter of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller,  Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are both nationals of the Philippines.  They are  mother
    and son whose dates of birth respectively are 31 January  1989  and  29
    January 2010.

 2. They appealed against the respondent's decision to  refuse  them  entry
    clearance as the spouse and child of Mr Remigo  Ancheta,  which  appeal
    was allowed by Judge Lal (the judge) in a decision  promulgated  on  24
    June 2015.

 3.  The  grounds  submit  that  the  judge  materially  erred  in  law  by
    misapplying the case law.  He recorded at  [14]  of  the  decision  the
    representatives' submissions with regard to SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA  Civ
    387 but  misapplied  the  same.   The  case  law  stated  the  positive
    obligation under Article 8 at [38] of SS but at [39] it discussed leave
    to enter the UK and reaffirmed  that  "Article  8  imposes  no  general
    obligation on a State to facilitate the choice made by a married couple
    to reside in it".  [39](ii) continued with:

         "In deciding whether to grant LTE to a family  member  outside  the
         United Kingdom, the State authorities may have regard to a range of
         factors, including the pressure which admission of an applicant may
         place upon public resources, the desirability of  promoting  social
         integration and harmony and so forth.   Refusal  of  LTE  in  cases
         where  these  interests  may  be  undermined  may   be   fair   and
         proportionate to the legitimate  interests  identified  in  Article
         8(2) of 'the economic wellbeing of the country' and 'the protection
         of the rights and freedoms of others' (tax payers  and  members  of
         society generally).  A court  will  be  slow  to  find  an  implied
         positive obligation which  would  involve  imposing  on  the  State
         significant additional expenditure, which will necessarily  involve
         a diversion of resources from other activities of the State in  the
         public interest, a matter which  usually  calls  for  consideration
         under democratic procedures".

 4. SS Congo also took into  account  a  child  applicant  at  [39](iv)  in
    acknowledging that a child was not a trump  card  but  was  a  relevant
    factor in assessing the fair balance between  the  individual  and  the
    community.  The paragraph continues:

         "The age of the child, the closeness of their relationship with the
         other family member in the United Kingdom and  whether  the  family
         could live together elsewhere are likely to  be  important  factors
         which should be borne in mind."

 5. At [44] the  case  law  reaffirmed  that  the  starting  point  in  the
    Immigration Rules was:

         "The proper approach should  always  be  to  identify,  first,  the
         substantive content of the relevant Immigration Rules, both to  see
         if an applicant for LTR or LTE satisfies the conditions  laid  down
         in those Rules (so as to be entitled  to  LTR  or  LTE  within  the
         Rules) and to assess the force of public interest given  expression
         in those Rules (which will be relevant to  the  balancing  exercise
         under Article 8, in deciding whether LTR or LTE should  be  granted
         outside  the  substantive  provisions  set  out  in   the   Rules).
         Secondly, if an applicant does not satisfy the requirements in  the
         substantive part of the Rules, they may seek to  maintain  a  claim
         for grant of LTR or LTE outside the substantive  provision  of  the
         Rules, pursuant to Article 8.  If there is  a  reasonably  arguable
         case under Article 8 which has not already been sufficiently  dealt
         with by consideration of  the  application  under  the  substantive
         provisions  of  the  Rules  (see  Nagre,  para.  [30]),   then   in
         considering that case the individual interest of the applicant  and
         others whose Article 8 rights  are  in  issue  should  be  balanced
         against the public interest, including as expressed in  the  Rules,
         in order to make an assessment whether refusal to grant LTR or LTE,
         as the case may be,  is  disproportionate  and  hence  unlawful  by
         virtue of section 6(1) of the HRA read with Article 8".

 6. The respondent submitted that in not applying the  case  law  correctly
    the judge failed to have regard to material matters, namely the  public
    interest.  In Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 it was stated at [35]:

         "... Under Appendix FM, detailed and demanding requirements have to
         be satisfied where an application for leave to enter is made by the
         foreign spouse of a British citizen, including  demonstrating  that
         the person sponsoring the  application  has  current  gross  annual
         income of at least �18,600 p.a. supported  by  specified  forms  of
         evidence as set out in Appendix FM-SE: for discussion, see SS Congo
         ..."

 7. Also, at [25] the judgment reads:

         "The mere fact that Mr Benette is a British citizen, has lived  all
         his life in the United Kingdom and has a job here - and hence might
         find it difficult and might be reluctant to re-locate  to  continue
         their family life  there  -  could  not  constitute  insurmountable
         obstacles to his doing so."

 8. The respondent further submitted that the judge did not have due regard
    to the respondent's position and the public interest which the case law
    confirmed, that weight needed to be attached to it.

 9. At [4] of the decision it was accepted that the sponsor could not  meet
    the required level of  income  by  his  own  income  or  cash  savings.
    Applying the case law correctly, the judge materially erred in  law  in
    his findings at [20] that the appellant had potential for making up the
    shortfall in future earnings.

10. It was submitted that applying the case law, the sponsor being 72 years
    of age and in employment, were not compelling factors.  The  judge  was
    required  to  consider  whether  the  sponsor  could  relocate  to  the
    Philippines with the appellants.  Only limited weight should  be  given
    to the sponsor's desire to re-establish himself with his family in  the
    United Kingdom.  It was the sponsor's own evidence  that  he  chose  to
    visit the appellants for periods of three months at  a  time.   It  was
    submitted that this showed that family life with a minor child could be
    enjoyed in the Philippines.  It was not  open  to  the  appellants  and
    sponsor to simply choose where they wanted to enjoy their  family  life
    without the public interest being considered.

11. Judge Astle granted permission to appeal on  14  September  2005.   She
    recited that the grounds argued that the judge misapplied SS  Congo  in
    that Article 8 did not impose  a  general  obligation  on  a  State  to
    facilitate the choice made  by  a  married  couple  to  reside  in  it.
    Further, that the judge failed to have  proper  regard  to  the  public
    interest.   The  sponsor's  age  and  employment  were  not  compelling
    factors.  Possible relocation of the sponsor  was  a  relevant  factor.
    Judge Astle considered it was arguable that the judge erred in  law  by
    not giving sufficient regard to the public interest and  the  inability
    of the appellants to satisfy the Rules.

12. The Rule 24 response submitted  that  no  arguable  error  of  law  was
    disclosed in the permission application.  The response relied  upon  MR
    (Permission to appeal: Tribunal's approach) Brazil  [2015]  UKUT  00029
    (IAC), SS, R (Daly) [2001] UKHL 26 at [27] and Agyarko.

13. The judge's analysis on proportionality could not  be  interfered  with
    except on a traditional public law basis.  R (Daly).

14. Judge Astle's grant of permission suggested  that  the  judge  made  an
    arguable error "... by not  giving  sufficient  regard  to  the  public
    interest and the inability of the appellants  to  satisfy  the  Rules."
    Judge Astle considered that the judge misapplied SS because he did  not
    have due regard to the public interest  that  the  case  law  confirmed
    needed to be taken into account.

15. The judge directed himself with regard to SS at [16]  of  his  decision
    and applied that approach to the facts by identifying  four  compelling
    circumstances.  The judge did give  sufficient  weight  to  the  public
    interest.

16. The grounds incorrectly cited [39](ii) rather than  (iii)  of  SS,  but
    took issue with what the judge said at [20] in finding that there would
    be no additional recourse to public funds.  The respondent's ground did
    not challenge that finding of fact on the basis that it was  Wednesbury
    unreasonable nor did it contend that the  judge  was  not  entitled  to
    consider and take into account the question of whether there  would  be
    additional recourse to public  funds  caused  by  the  arrival  of  the
    appellants.  The question under paragraph 297(v) of  the  Rules,  which
    had not been addressed by the Entry Clearance Officer, was whether  the
    respondent child could be adequately maintained and his mother's future
    earning potential was relevant to that  issue.   Of  more  significance
    perhaps to the respondent's ground by reference to [39](iii) SS was the
    absence of any challenge to the judge's finding of an implied  positive
    obligation on the respondent under Article 8 in terms  of  respect  for
    the family life between the appellants and the sponsor.

17. The judge gave legally adequate reasons for finding that there would be
    severe hardship for the  sponsor  in  relocating  to  the  Philippines.
    Agyarko was not authority for the proposition that the  judge  was  not
    entitled to find  that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    sponsor relocating.   Agyarko  at  [24]  observed  that  the  sponsor's
    relocation was a factor to be taken into  account  in  the  context  of
    making a wider Article 8 assessment outside the Rules.  The  fact  that
    the respondent referred to the sponsor's evidence of spending time with
    the appellants in the Philippines and said that showed that family life
    could be enjoyed there, amounted to nothing more  than  a  disagreement
    with the finding made by the judge.  The judge took  into  account  the
    sponsor's age, nationality, length of residence in the United  Kingdom,
    his private/family life ties to  the  United  Kingdom  with  his  other
    children, his employment in the United Kingdom and inability to  obtain
    meaningful employment in the Philippines.

Submissions on Error of Law

18. Ms Brocklesby-Weller relied upon the  grounds.   Blake  J  held  in  MM
    (Lebanon) [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) that proper weight should  be  given
    to the legitimate public interest  considerations  which  underlay  the
    formulation of the Immigration Rules.  The  judge's  approach  was  not
    consistent with MM or SS and my attention was drawn  to  [39]-]40]  and
    [44] of SS.  The appellants could not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.   The  only  "compelling  circumstances"  the  judge
    identified were set out at [18] of his decision.

19. Mr Slatter relied upon the Rule 24 response.  He said  that  the  judge
    had identified and set out compelling circumstances.   He  had  reached
    his  decision  following  SS.  He  had  referred  to  public   interest
    considerations.

Conclusion on Error of Law

20. The judge explained why the appellants did  not  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules at [4] of his decision.  Income and capital were  deficient.   It
    might have been that the income shortfall could be made up from savings
    but the capital shortfall was still in excess of �10,000.

21. At [35] of SS, the Court of Appeal held that the correct legal approach
    in terms of "exceptionality" and "very compelling reasons" lay  between
    those extremes because the position with regard to  LTE  was  different
    from the position with regard to LTR.  See the analysis at [32]-[38] of
    SS.

22. See in particular [39] with regard to  Article  8  in  relation  to  an
    application for LTE on the basis of family life with the person here:

         "In our judgment, the position under Article 8 in  relation  to  an
         application for LTE on the basis  of  family  life  with  a  person
         already in the United Kingdom is as follows:

               i) A person outside the United Kingdom may have a good  claim
                  under Article 8 to be allowed to enter the United  Kingdom
                  to join family members already here so as to  continue  or
                  develop existing family life: See e.g. Gul  v  Switzerland
                  [1996] 22 EHRR 93 and Sen v Netherlands [2001] 36 EHRR  7.
                  Article 8 does not confer an  automatic  right  of  entry,
                  however.  Article 8 imposes no  general  obligation  on  a
                  state to facilitate the choice made by a married couple to
                  reside in it: R (Quila) v Secretary of State for the  Home
                  Department  [2011]  UKSC  45;  [2012]  1  AC  621,   [42];
                  Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United Kingdom  [1985]
                  7 EHRR 471, [68]; Gul v Switzerland, [38].  The  state  is
                  entitled to control immigration: Huang [18].

              ii) The approach to  identifying  positive  obligations  under
                  Article 8(1) draws on Article 8(2) by analogy, but is  not
                  identical with analysis under Article 8(2):  see,  in  the
                  immigration context,  Abdulaziz,  Cabales  and  Balkandali
                  [67]-[68]; Gul v Switzerland, [38]; and Sen v  Netherlands
                  [31]-[32].   See  also  the  general   guidance   on   the
                  applicable principles given by the Grand  Chamber  of  the
                  ECTHR in Draon v France [2006] 42 ERRR 40 at  [105]-[108],
                  summarising the effect of the leading authorities ...

             iii) In deciding whether  to  grant  LTE  to  a  family  member
                  outside the United Kingdom, the state authorities may have
                  regard to a range of factors, including the pressure which
                  admission of an applicant may place upon public resources,
                  the  desirability  of  promoting  social  integration  and
                  harmony and so forth.  Refusal of LTE in cases where these
                  interests may be undermined may be fair and  proportionate
                  to the legitimate interest identified in Article  8(2)  of
                  "the  economic  well-being  of  the  country"   and   "the
                  protection of the rights  and  freedoms  of  others"  (tax
                  payers and members of society generally).  A court will be
                  slow to find an implied positive  obligation  which  would
                  involve  imposing  on  the  state  significant  additional
                  expenditure, which will necessarily involve a diversion of
                  resources from other activities of the state in the public
                  interest, a matter which usually calls  for  consideration
                  under democratic procedures.

              iv) On the other hand, the fact that the interests of a  child
                  are in issue will be a countervailing factor  which  tends
                  to reduce to some  degree  the  width  of  the  margin  of
                  appreciation which the state authorities  would  otherwise
                  enjoy.  Article 8 has to be interpreted and applied in the
                  light of the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of  the  Child
                  [1989]: see in Re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody appeal)
                  [2011] UKSC 27; [2012] 1 AC 144 at [26].  However the fact
                  that the interests of a child are in issue does not simply
                  provide a  trump  card  so  that  a  child  applicant  for
                  positive action to be taken by the state in the  field  of
                  Article 8(1) must always have  their  application  acceded
                  to; see in Re E  (Children)  at  [12]  and  ZH  (Tanzania)
                  [2011] UKSC 4; [2011] 2 AC 166 at [25] (under Article 3(1)
                  of the UN Convention on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  the
                  interests of the child are a primary consideration -  i.e.
                  an important matter - not the primary consideration).   It
                  is a factor relevant  to  the  fair  balance  between  the
                  individual and the general community which goes  some  way
                  towards   tampering   the   otherwise   wide   margin   of
                  appreciation  available  to  the  state   authorities   in
                  deciding what to do.  The age of the child, the  closeness
                  of their relationship with the other family member in  the
                  United Kingdom and whether the family could live  together
                  elsewhere are likely to be important factors which  should
                  be borne in mind.

               v) If family life can be carried on elsewhere it is  unlikely
                  that "a direct and immediate link" will exist between  the
                  measures requested by an applicant and his  family  (Draon
                  [106]; Botta v Italy [1998] 26 EHRR 241, [35]), so  as  to
                  provide the basis for an implied obligation upon the state
                  under  Article  8(1)  to  grant  LTE;  see  also   Gul   v
                  Switzerland, [42].

23. I drew the advocates' attention to Sunassee [2005]  EWHC  1604  (Admin)
    which gave a helpful analysis of SS and sought to simplify the  complex
    requirements under the Rules by suggesting that  whether  circumstances
    were "compelling" or "exceptional"  was  not  a  matter  of  substance.
    Rather, they must be relevant,  weighty  and  not  fully  provided  for
    within the Rules.  That is, there must be a "gap", not covered  by  the
    Rules.  Whilst in practice, those gap issues were  likely  to  be  both
    compelling and exceptional, that was not a legal requirement.

24. The judge referred to the public interest but  in  my  view,  he  erred
    because he failed to carry out any analysis in that regard.  The  judge
    said at [18] that he had considered the matter "...  with  some  care",
    however,  I  find  that  his  analysis  that  compelling  circumstances
    existed, was inadequate.  The compelling  circumstances  identified  by
    the judge were:

    .    Age of the sponsor - 72 years of age.

    .    The sponsor's nationality - he is British.

    .    The duration of the sponsor's life in the United Kingdom - he  has
         lived here for over 40 years.

    .    The sponsor has five adult children in the United  Kingdom  and  a
         number of grandchildren.  They are all currently estranged from the
         sponsor because of the sponsor's marriage to the  first  appellant,
         however, the sponsor hopes for a reconciliation.

    .    The sponsor still continues  to  work,  albeit  part-time  in  the
         United Kingdom  and  would  be  unable  to  obtain  any  meaningful
         employment in the Philippines.

    .    The arrival of the  appellants  would  not  cause  any  additional
         recourse to public funds and they could  and  would  be  adequately
         maintained and accommodated here.  Further, the first appellant has
         a  tailoring  qualification  such  that  she  has  future   earning
         potential in the United Kingdom which could make up  the  shortfall
         between income and capital and the requirements of the Rules.

    .    It would be in the best interests of the second  appellant  to  be
         with both parents.

25. In reaching those findings, the judge carried out either  no  analysis,
    or an inadequate analysis, of the public interest considerations.   His
    finding as compelling circumstances that the appellants would not cause
    any additional recourse to  public  funds,  they  would  be  adequately
    maintained and accommodated and the first appellant had future  earning
    potential, ignored the fact that they could not meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules.

26. The judge failed to explain why it  was  that  the  sponsor  could  not
    relocate to the  Philippines.   The  evidence  was  that  he  had  been
    returning there annually for three months of each year.

27. There was no explanation as to why  the  sponsor  would  be  unable  to
    obtain any meaningful employment on return to the  Philippines  because
    of his age, when he had been able to obtain employment  in  the  United
    Kingdom, such skills which he might well be able to exploit  on  return
    to the Philippines.  In  any  event,  Agyarko  was  authority  for  the
    proposition that merely because the sponsor had  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a considerable time and had a part-time job here such  that
    he might find it difficult and might be reluctant to  relocate  to  the
    Philippines  to  continue  family  life  there,  could  not  constitute
    insurmountable obstacles to his doing so.  I  do  accept  that  Agyarko
    referred to leave to remain and not leave to enter, however,  in  these
    particular circumstances, I do not accept that anything  turns  on  the
    difference in wording in the Immigration Rules.  The circumstances  are
    slightly different.  In Agyarko, the sponsor had lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom all his life, whereas this particular  sponsor,  whilst  living
    here a considerable time, has not lived here all his life and  is  only
    working on a part-time basis.

28. Both with regard to the substantive appeal in terms of  the  Rules  and
    with regard to S.117B, I find  the  judge  erred  in  failing  to  take
    account of the public interest considerations applicable and in failing
    to carry out or carrying out an inadequate analysis with regard to  the
    same.

29. I set aside the decision of  the  judge  and  proceed  to  re-make  the
    decision.

30. I take into account the best interests of the second appellant  who  as
    of the date of the hearing before me is 5 years of  age,  his  date  of
    birth being 29 January 2010.  The Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD
    [2011] UKSC 4, emphasised that the best interests of a child need to be
    considered as a separate and distinct aspect.   In EA (Article 8 - Best
    interests of the child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 315 it was  said  that  the
    correct starting point in considering the welfare and best interests of
    a young child would be that it was in the best interests of a child  to
    live with and be brought up by his or her parents, subject to any  very
    strong contra-indication. Absent other factors, the reason why a period
    of  substantial  residence  as  a  child   might   become   a   weighty
    consideration in the balance of competing considerations,  is  that  in
    the course of such time, roots are put down,  personal  identities  are
    developed, friendships are formed and links are made with the community
    outside the family unit.  It was emphasised that the  degree  to  which
    elements of private life are forged and  therefore  the  weight  to  be
    given to the passage of time would depend upon the facts of each  case.
    It was concluded that long residence of a child likely to  have  formed
    ties outside the family, is likely to have a greater impact on  his  or
    her well-being. In MK (Best interests of child) [2011] UKUT  00475  and
    in AJ (India) [2011] EWCA Civ 1191, it was emphasised that  an  overall
    assessment was important, keeping the best interests of  the  child  in
    mind throughout as a primary consideration.

31. I do accept that the best interests of a child generally are that he be
    brought up by both parents in the same household. Nevertheless,  family
    life has been established and has continued  since  the  birth  of  the
    second appellant with the sponsor visiting for three  months  annually.
    There is contact between the appellants and the sponsor in the  interim
    by various means. The appellants are supported by the sponsor from  the
    United Kingdom. The second appellant aged five has known no other  life
    than living with his mother, being supported from the United Kingdom by
    his father and his father visiting for three months of every year.

32. I find family life can continue  as  hitherto,  or  alternatively,  the
    sponsor can relocate to the Philippines.  I  do  not  accept  that  the
    matters I have set  out  above  at  [24]  are  such  as  to  amount  to
    compelling circumstances preventing such relocation. I  do  not  accept
    that the sponsor's age, (he is 72), British  nationality  or  the  fact
    that he has lived here for 40 years is such as to make the respondent's
    decision disproportionate.  I bear in mind in that assessment that  the
    sponsor was originally from the Philippines and returns there  annually
    for a considerable time. The parties cannot choose where it is  in  the
    world they wish to reside. See SS at [39](i).

33. I do not accept that the fact that the sponsor has a family  here  from
    whom he is estranged but with whom he hopes to have  a  reconciliation,
    makes the respondent's decision disproportionate.

34. I find the sponsor can seek work if he wishes in the  Philippines.  See
    what I have said in that regard and with reference to Agyarko  at  [27]
    above. The sponsor has  not  lived  here  all  his  life,  he  has  had
    significant annual residence in the Philippines  and  is  only  working
    here on a part-time basis for a proportion of the year.

35. I am also required to give consideration to the  aspects  specified  in
    S.117 of the 2002 Act as amended by the Immigration Act 2014.  There is
    an overlap between the Rules and S.117. Relevant  factors  under  S.117
    are as follows:

36. S.117B(3). I am required to give consideration as a factor relevant  to
    the  public  interest,   whether   the   appellants   are   financially
    independent.  It is significant in that regard that they  do  not  meet
    the financial requirements of the Rules. See SS at  [39](iii)  at  [22]
    above. I do not accept that it is any answer to claim that the  arrival
    of the appellants would not cause any  additional  recourse  to  public
    funds,  that  they  could  and  would  be  adequately  maintained   and
    accommodated and that the  first  appellant  has  the  hope  of  future
    earnings.

37. I bear in mind S.117B(5) that little weight should  be  given  to  life
    established when immigration status was precarious.   See  SS  at  [37]
    which discusses marriage and family life to  a  foreign  national  when
    that person has no right to come here. I find these  are  issues  which
    the sponsor and first appellant considered or should have considered at
    the time they entered into their relationship.

38. The appellants do not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    such that I have considered their circumstances  in  terms  of  SS  and
    Sunassee, described as the "gap" issues at [36] of  Sunassee.   I  find
    there are no relevant, weighty matters which are not fully provided for
    within the Rules. If there are then I find the respondent's decision to
    be proportionate, for the reasons I have set out above.

39. For the reasons I have given, I set  aside  the  judge's  decision  and
    remake the same. The appellants' appeals are dismissed under the  Rules
    and on Human Rights grounds.
