                       (anonymity direction NOT  MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant's appeal against the  refusal  of  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of rights of residence as an extended family member  under
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006  was  dismissed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge I M Scott for want of jurisdiction.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  26
    February 2018 on the ground it was arguable the  judge  erred  in  law:
    Sala (EFMs: right of appeal [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC)  and  Khan  v  SSHD
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

3.   I find that there is an error of law  in  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge I M Scott promulgated on 12 September 2017 and I set  it
    aside. I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal  to  reconsider  the
    appeal.
