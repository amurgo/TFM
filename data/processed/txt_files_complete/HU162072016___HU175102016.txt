For the Respondents:   In person


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The respondents (hereafter the claimants) are citizens of Nigeria.   In
    a decision sent on 16 October 2017 Judge  Frankish  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) allowed their appeals on Article 8 grounds.  The grounds
    on which the appellant (hereafter the Secretary of State or  SSHD)  was
    granted permission took principal  aim  at  what  the  judge  wrote  at
    paragraphs 20-21.

         "20. Thus far, I find the balance not  to  tip  in  favour  of  the
             appellants.  The point of most concern to me in this  case  is
             tucked away at ï¿½29 of the appellant's witness  statement.   It
             received not a mention from anyone else.  It is there that the
             appellant reveals that she is from  a  family  that  practices
             female circumcision, or FGM.  There is no medical evidence  to
             this effect.  Nonetheless I  find  that,  on  the  balance  of
             probabilities, it is the case.  In the first place it  emerges
             in her evidence solely in  passing  as  a  digression  to  the
             husband's objections to her lack of sexual  response.   It  is
             set in a context where she thought  she  was  circumcised  but
             thought she should check with her mother because  her  husband
             took it so seriously, the  mother  confirming  that  she  was.
             There is the telling point as to the husband lamenting that he
             was deceived into marrying her  and  that  she  was  a  fraud.
             Finally, the fact that the appellant  has  totally  failed  to
             rely  upon  this  significant  point   further   supports   my
             conclusion that she has undergone FGM.


         21.  Obviously, FGM is a process which is normally undergone  at  a
             very young age.  That  was  no  less  obviously  the  case  in
             respect of the appellant as she had no memory of it but merely
             accepted it as a fact.  That potentially counts as an  adverse
             factor against the second  appellant  facing  the  same  fate.
             Nonetheless, as a small-scale trader when in Nigeria, and  the
             cleaner in the UK, the appellant would  be  totally  dependent
             upon her family until she finds her feet.  Although Christian,
             I have found her to be  from  an  FGM-practising  family,  she
             herself having undergone the procedure.  As  such,  once  back
             under the complete control of  her  family,  I  conclude  that
             there  is  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  let  alone  a
             reasonable likelihood, a prospect of FGM being inflicted  upon
             the second appellant.  I am aware that I may be seen  to  have
             completely  gone  out  on  a  frolic  of  my   own   in   this
             consideration.   However,  my  conclusions  relating  to   the
             appellant's FGM lead me inexorably to the question of the same
             facing the second appellant even though it appears nowhere, in
             its own right, as part of the appellants'  case.   That  being
             so, it cannot be reasonable to expect the appellant  to  leave
             and the first appellant must stay with her."


2.   It is submitted that risk of FGM to  the  second  claimant  was  not  a
    matter relied on by the claimants and  no  medical  evidence  had  been
    produced to support the judge's conclusion that the first claimant  had
    undergone FGM.

3.   At the hearing before me the  first  claimant  appeared  unrepresented.
    Her representatives had sent a letter to the Upper Tribunal  explaining
    they could no longer  represent  due  to  lack  of  funds.   The  first
    claimant indicated she was able to proceed and I explained to her  that
    I would  do  my  best  to  ensure  her  case  was  considered  properly
    notwithstanding her lack of legal help.  I then heard submissions  from
    Mrs Aboni.  In the course of these submissions Mrs Aboni agreed with me
    that in addition to the failings on the part of the judge raised in the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department's  grounds,  the  judge  had
    also failed to apply to the second claimant the guidance set out by the
    Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 in respect of  the
    second claimant who appears to have resided in the  UK  since  December
    2008, i.e. over nine years.

4.   I then heard briefly from the first  claimant  who  said  she  believed
    that she was entitled to succeed in her appeal given the fact that  the
    best interests of her daughter were  to  remain  in  the  UK  with  her
    mother.

5.   I reserved my decision.

6.   I have no hesitation in concluding that the FtT judge erred in  law  in
    paragraphs 20 and 21.  The claimants had not expressed a  fear  of  the
    second claimant being at risk of FGM on return and the judge's decision
    did not establish a sufficient factual matrix to justify a finding that
    she would face such a risk objectively.   Despite  accepting  that  the
    previous Tribunal had made adverse findings on the claimant's  previous
    asylum appeal, the judge was prepared to accept that at  the  time  the
    first claimant had been the subject of an  abusive  relationship.   Why
    that finding should extend to  acceptance  that  the  first  claimant's
    family were FGM-practising Christians or that the  first  claimant  had
    been subject to FGM, is wholly unclear.  The judge  not  only  accepted
    that he may be seen in paragraphs 20, 21 to have gone on "a  frolic  of
    my own", his "frolic" had no rational basis.

7.   I would add that the judge's decision  is  flawed  for  another  reason
    which potentially could have affected the outcome of  the  appeal,  had
    the judge not allowed it on the basis  of  risk  of  FGM.   The  second
    claimant was a child who had resided in the UK for over seven years and
    hence the judge  was  required  to  consider  whether  pursuant  to  MA
    (Pakistan) there were strong or powerful reasons to expect  the  second
    claimant to depart the UK.  Not only had the judge failed to  undertake
    such a consideration but he also  failed  to  make  any  evidence-based
    findings in respect of the  precise  circumstances  the  two  claimants
    would face if returned to Nigeria.

8.   In light of these failings I conclude that the case should be  remitted
    to the FtT so that factual findings  can  be  made  on  the  claimants'
    likely circumstances on return to Nigeria.  It  will  be  open  to  the
    claimants to produce further evidence.  If (since  the  issue  has  now
    been raised) the first claimant wishes to rely on risk to her  daughter
    of FGM she should submit a further witness statement detailing why such
    a risk is said to exist and why it would not be avoidable.

9.   Whilst the next FtT judge may well  decide  (like  Judge  Frankish)  to
    accept that the first claimant has been in an abusive  relationship  it
    would still be necessary to consider whether previous adverse  findings
    made on her credibility should  continue  to  apply  against  her  when
    assessing her claim about family circumstances in Nigeria.

10.  For the above reasons:

    The decision of the FtT judge is set aside for material error of law.

    The case is  remitted  to  be  heard  by  the  FtT  (not  before  Judge
    Frankish).

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless  and  until  a  Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  second
appellant is granted  anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify her or any member  of  their  family.   This
direction applies both to the appellants and to the respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
