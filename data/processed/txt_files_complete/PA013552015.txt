                           (anonymity order made)
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Mills,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Hussain, Counsel instructed by Crown Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent HL is a national of C�te D'Ivoire born in 1980.   On the
    18th November 2016 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Shanahan) allowed his
    deportation appeal on human rights grounds. The Secretary of State  for
    the  Home  Department  now  has  permission  to  appeal  against   that
    decision[1].


 2. The essence of the HL's case before the First-tier Tribunal was that it
    would be a violation of his core human rights if he were to be  removed
    to C�te D'Ivoire. He is gay,  and  has  been  diagnosed  with  paranoid
    schizophrenia: the cumulative impact of these personal  characteristics
    would be such that his removal would give rise to  a  real  risk  of  a
    breach of Article 3.    The First-tier Tribunal agreed and allowed  the
    appeal. The Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  now  contends
    that the decision is flawed for the following material errors of law:

              i) The Tribunal has failed to apply the high  test  applicable
                 in Article 3 health cases, as set out N v  UK  [2008]  ECHR
                 453 and GS and EO (Article 3 - health cases)  India  [2012]
                 UKUT 397 (IAC)


             ii) Making findings contrary to its own directions.





    Discussion and Findings

 3. The Secretary of State for the Home Department notes that at  paragraph
    55 of the determination the Tribunal directs itself as follows:


         "However, even taking these matters into account I go back  to  the
         very high test set out in N and from a  medical  point  of  view  I
         cannot  be  satisfied  that  simply  being  unable  to  access  the
         treatment available in Kenya [sic] amounts to a breach  of  Article
         3"

    She then draws a contrast between that legal direction and the findings
    at paragraph 59:


         "Therefore while there is support  from  the  Government  the  fact
         remains that this Appellant would face significant difficulties  in
         finding employment to enable him to pay for medical  treatment  and
         medication which would eventually result in a deterioration of  his
         condition and the treatment I have referred to above  in  paragraph
         51"


    The Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  submits  that  the
    Tribunal has in effect failed to apply the "very high test" set out  in
    N, and has allowed the appeal for the - insufficient - reasons set  out
    at paragraph 59.


 4. Had the First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal simply on the  basis  of
    its findings of fact at paragraph 59,  I  would  have  agreed.   It  is
    however quite plain that it did not.  Having  carefully  evaluated  the
    evidence before it the Tribunal found:


        . That HL had been subjected to ritual and voodoo  practices  as  a
          child (including sexual abuse) [at 37]
        . That HL is an openly gay man [38]
        . that LGBT men in the C�te D'Ivoire  face  discrimination  and  on
          occasion violence and intimidation (albeit that Abidjan offers  a
          degree of freedom over that available  in  other  parts  of  West
          Africa) [43]
        . that HL suffers from paranoid schizophrenia [47]
        . that his condition deteriorates  significantly  if  he  does  not
          comply with his medication regime [49]
        . that the provision for mental health care  in  C�te  D'Ivoire  is
          "extremely  limited"  [52]  and  that  in  particular  the   drug
          Risperidone, which has been essential to LH's rehabilitation,  is
          not available [53]
        . that mental illness is considered in West Africa to be a magical,
          supernatural event, caused  by  spirits  taking  over  the  body.
          People  suffering  from  mental  disorders  are  believed  to  be
          possessed by evil  spirits  and  are  often  abandoned  by  their
          families,  left  to  wander  the  streets  alone  with  no  food.
          Alternatively they are sent to 'prayer camps' where the treatment
          consists of being chained to a  tree  for  an  indefinite  period
          whilst others pray for their recovery


 5. Having made those findings the Tribunal reminded  itself  of  the  high
    test applicable in health cases [55] before saying the following [at 56-
    57]:


         "Nonetheless I am satisfied  that  this  Appellant's  case  can  be
         distinguished from N and GS. In both those cases the withdrawal  of
         medical treatment  would  lead  to  a  drastic  shortening  of  the
         Appellants' lives through the progress of natural disease.  It  was
         said in GS that such a case could only succeed under Article  3  if
         it fell within the exception set out in D v United  Kingdom  [1997]
         ECHR 30240/96.


         In this appeal the Appellant's case is not so much how his life may
         be shortened because of the disease/condition but  because  of  the
         consequences and the ill-treatment and degrading treatment he would
         be faced with because of his behaviour if he  failed  to  take  his
         medication and became unwell".


 6. It is in the context of these  comments  that  the  Tribunal  makes  it
    findings [at 59] about the likely deterioration in HL's mental  health,
    and that in the C�te D'Ivoire this would  likely  result  in  exclusion
    from society, destitution or the 'treatment' of being chained to a tree
    for an indefinite period. The Tribunal goes on to find that the HL  has
    no support mechanism in the C�te D'Ivoire since he  has  no  family  or
    other connections there, and that as an openly gay man he is likely  to
    encounter  discrimination.  Both  of  these  factors  would  make   him
    especially vulnerable if, as is likely, his condition deteriorates  due
    to lack of mental health care. It was the accumulation of these factors
    which led to the decision that the  HL's  removal  would  result  in  a
    violation of Article 3.


 7. I am quite satisfied that the grounds are not made  out.  The  Tribunal
    has not allowed the appeal on the basis of a withdrawal of health care.
      It has allowed the appeal on the grounds that there  are  substantial
    grounds for believing that HL will face inhuman and degrading treatment
    in Ivorian society because he has paranoid  schizophrenia,  because  he
    has no family  to  support  him  and  because  he  is  gay.   That  was
    manifestly a finding open to the Tribunal on the evidence before it.

 8. The only error in this determination, if any, is that  the  appeal  was
    dismissed on asylum grounds. The case had been subject to a section  72
    certificate but that had not been upheld. The finding that HL would  be
    subjected to serious harm would amount  to  a  finding  that  he  is  a
    refugee, if any one of the reasons for the persecution feared  was  one
    of those adumbrated in Article 1A(2) of  the  Refugee  Convention.  The
    harm was held to result from a combination of  factors,  two  of  which
    would constitute 'membership  of  a  particular  social  group',  those
    suffering from chronic mental illness, and homosexuals.  There being no
    cross appeal, I do not substitute the findings of the Tribunal on  this
    point, but simply make the observation that as  a  matter  of  law,  it
    would appear that the HL is a refugee.




      Decisions


 9. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law such that it should be set aside.


10. LH has  been  convicted  of  a  criminal  offence  and  is  subject  to
    deportation  proceedings.  He  would  not,  in   those   circumstances,
    ordinarily benefit from an order to protect his identity.  This  appeal
    does however concerns a claim  for  protection  involving  both  sexual
    abuse and mental illness.  Having had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the  Presidential  Guidance
    Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I therefore consider it appropriate
    to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"
