  DETERMINATION AND REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW/NO ERROR OR
                                     LAW

Introduction

1.   The appellants before the  First-tier  Tribunal  (who  are  respondents
    before  this  Tribunal)  are  all  citizens  of  Pakistan.   The  first
    appellant (Mr Gurmani) is the  husband  of  the  third  appellant  (Mrs
    Fatima) and the father of the second appellant (Master  Gurmani).   The
    appellant before this Tribunal is the Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department (the Secretary of State).

2.   The appellants first came to the UK with  entry  clearance  valid  from
    10th May 2006.  Mrs Fatima had valid entry clearance from 10  May  2007
    and, presumably, Master Gurmani, who  was  born  on  2  December  2005,
    travelled here with his mother in 2007.

3.   On the date which does not appear  from  the  application,  Mr  Gurmani
    applied for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  It  appears
    that Mrs Fatima applied as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  dependant  with
    Master Gurmani.

4.   Those applications  were  refused  by  the  Secretary  of  State  under
    paragraphs 245ZX and Rule 319 of the Immigration Rules.  The  Secretary
    of State also decided to remove the appellants from the UK.

The Appeal Proceedings

5.   On 20 November 2013  the  appellants,  having  paid  the  correct  fee,
    sought to appeal the Secretary of State's refusal of further  leave  to
    remain in each case.  The hearing came before First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Adio (the Immigration Judge) at Hatton Cross on  15  April  2014.   His
    determination was promulgated on 1 May  2014.   The  Immigration  Judge
    found that the total period Mr Gurmani had been within the  UK  was  22
    months.

Proceedings before the Upper Tribunal

6.   Following the promulgation of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,
    the Secretary of State gave notice of appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    which was received on 12 May 2014.  The Secretary of  State  cited  the
    following grounds:

    (1)  she disputed that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  jurisdiction  to
         determine the appeal on the correct application of Section 88(2) of
         the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002;


    (2)  the Immigration Judge's calculation of time for  the  purposes  of
         identifying whether Mr Gurmani had spent five years within  the  UK
         was flawed.


7.   The application for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    considered by Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  McClure  who
    decided that:

    (1)  as the appellants were seeking to remain in the UK  for  a  period
         beyond 2015 it was arguable that they were seeking to remain beyond
         the time permitted by the Rules;


    (2)  although he had reservations, the DIJ also thought it arguable  by
         the Secretary of State that a  further  period  of  study  was  not
         permitted under the Rules and  therefore  there  was  no  right  of
         appeal under Section 88(2)(a) - (d) of the 2002 Act.   All  grounds
         were therefore allowed to be argued before the Upper Tribunal.


8.   Standard directions were sent out on 23 May 2014  indicating  that  the
    Tribunal would determine the appeal but the Upper  Tribunal  would  not
    hear fresh evidence without an application  indicating  the  nature  of
    that evidence and explaining why it was not submitted before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  Directions were sent out on 17 June 2014.  The  hearing
    was fixed for 22 July 2014 at 10am.

The Hearing

9.   Unfortunately, neither party's submissions were easy to  follow.  As  I
    indicated to the advocates, it  would  have  been  helpful  to  have  a
    skeleton argument  setting  out  the  issues  in  the  appeal  and  the
    arguments of law. However, since the hearing, helpfully, Mr  Ahmed  has
    sent a skeleton argument to the Tribunal, which was  received  on  24th
    July 2014.

10.  As I understand the Secretary of State's argument, it is  that  Section
    88 excludes the right of appeal  in  Section  82(1)  of  the  2002  Act
    against certain types of decision, including a person who is seeking to
    remain in the UK for a period  other  than  one  permitted  within  the
    Immigration Rules. The maximum period set by paragraph  245ZX  (ha)  of
    the Immigration Rules is a period of five years so that  the  grant  of
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant or  as  a  student  on  a
    course of degree level or above must not lead to the  applicant  having
    spent more than five years in the UK  studying  on  degree  courses  or
    above.  This is subject to certain exceptions.  It  was  not  contended
    that any of the exceptions applied here.  I was referred to the case of
    Islam [2013] UKUT 608 (IAC) by Mr  Tufan.   However,  there  the  issue
    before the Tribunal was whether  the  time  that  Mr  Islam  had  spent
    studying on a degree level course prior to the introduction of the Tier
    4 scheme counted towards the calculation of the five years.  The  Upper
    Tribunal decided that it did and accordingly the Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal had been correct to dismiss his appeal.

11.  Mr Tufan submitted that it was the period of  time  actually  spent  in
    the UK that counted towards the calculation of the period, not the time
    spent studying.

12.  I then heard from Mr Ahmed, a solicitor instructed  on  behalf  of  the
    appellants.  He submitted that the period of time ought  to  relate  to
    the "actual period" here whilst studying for a degree.  The case of  AM
    [2009] UKAIT 2 did not support the contention that the correct approach
    was to look at the period actually spent studying  without  calculating
    the actual period spent on the degree course.

13.  The Secretary of State's calculation was  that  Mr  Gurmani  had  spent
    three years, six months and ten days in the UK and therefore a  further
    grant of leave to remain for eighteen months would take  him  over  the
    five years.  The question before the Tribunal therefore  was  how  this
    time had been calculated?  It was submitted that the  way  through  all
    this confusion was to look at the judge's determination  at  paragraphs
    16 - 17.  In particular, at paragraph 17 he  had  correctly  calculated
    the period as being 22 months in total.   The  guidance  supported  the
    Immigration Judge's approach as being clear and correct.   The  present
    course Mr Gurmani was on lasted less than five years.

14.  I allowed Mr Tufan a right of reply.  He said the  relevant  chronology
    here was that the appellant had been granted various periods  of  leave
    to remain from 10 September 2008  until  9  September  2013,  when  the
    current  application  was  made.   The  latest  application  took   the
    appellant over the five year period.  I was referred by Mr Tufan to one
    of the appellant's own documents at page 19 of his bundle produced  for
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.  This  suggested  that  the
    commencement of study was 3 September 2008 at  the  London  College  of
    Business and Technology.  The appellant had not  been  studying  for  a
    degree course for the whole duration of his presence in the UK.

15.  Having considered the matter for a few minutes I decided to reserve  my
    decision as to whether there was a material  error  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Discussion

16.  Paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules requires  students  to  comply
    with the requirements of paragraph (ha).   That  subparagraph  provides
    for a maximum period of five years in the UK "as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Migrant, or as a student, studying courses at  degree  level  or  above
    ..." I understand that none of the exceptions to that requirement apply
    here.

17.  The appellants' appeal  rights  against  an  immigration  decision  are
    curtailed where he is seeking to be in the United Kingdom for a  period
    greater than that permitted by the Immigration Rules (i.e. five years).

18.  There are exceptions to  Section  88(2)  contained  in  Section  88(4).
    These include racial discrimination, an argument that the  decision  is
    contrary to the Human Rights Convention or  that  the  appellant  is  a
    refugee within the Refugee Convention.  None of those exceptions appear
    to apply here.

19.  The calculation of the five years  for  the  purposes  of  the  Tier  4
    scheme is a difficult matter but, with respect, I found the Immigration
    Judge's calculation  in  paragraphs  16  and  17  somewhat  convoluted.
    Paragraph 245ZX(ha) states that the "grant of leave to remain ...  must
    not lead to the applicant having spent more than five years in  the  UK
    as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant, or as a student ,  studying  courses  at
    degree level or above".  Thus it is only the period of time within  the
    UK studying at degree level or above that is to be counted.

20.  Assuming the first period of  study  is  ignored  (10  May  2006  -  14
    September 2008), presumably on the basis that NQF3 is not a  degree  or
    equivalent to  degree  level,  nevertheless  the  appellant  spent  the
    following periods in the UK for the purposes of study at  degree  level
    or above:
       . 21 November 2008 - 30 November 2009 (approximately twelve months).


       . 25 January 2010 - 4 July 2011 (approximately eighteen months).

       . August 2012 - 9 September 2013 (approximately thirteen months).

21.  The most recent application, which results in the present  appeal,  was
    to study for eighteen months from 2 October 2013  -  2  April  2015  (a
    further eighteen month period).   By my calculation therefore, based on
    Mr Gurmani's witness statement, he had spent at least three years,  six
    months and ten days in the UK at the time  of  his  application  and  a
    further application would result in him being here more than  the  five
    years permitted by the Immigration Rules.  Accordingly,  the  appellant
    had no right of appeal under Section 82(1) of  the  2002  Act  and  the
    calculation within the determination of the First-tier Tribunal appears
    incorrect.  As a person whose application resulted  in  him  having  to
    spend more than five years in the UK studying courses at  degree  level
    or above the Immigration Judge ought to have dismissed the  appellants'
    appeals against the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  refuse  them
    further leave to remain and he ought to have found that  there  was  no
    appeal right.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material  error  of  law.
The Secretary  of  State's  appeal  against  that  decision  is  allowed.  I
substitute my decision which is that  the  appellants'  appeal  against  the
decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  further  leave  to  remain  is
dismissed.

Anonymity direction not made.

Fee Award

The appellants were awarded their fees of �420.  I set aside  that  decision
having regard to the fact that this appeal by the  Secretary  of  State  has
succeeded.
