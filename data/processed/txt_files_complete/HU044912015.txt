Solicitors
                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  a  decision  of
       the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  an  appeal  by  the  respondent,
       hereinafter "the claimant", against the decision of the Secretary of
       State on 6 August 2015 refusing him leave to remain on human  rights
       grounds.

    2. At the risk of oversimplification and by way of  introduction  only,
       the First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal with reference to Article
       8 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  because  he  was
       satisfied that the claimant had married in the  United  Kingdom  and
       would probably satisfy the requirements of the Rules  for  admission
       as a husband if he chose to return to his country of nationality and
       make an application.  It is the Secretary of State's contention that
       the judge's approach was entirely wrong and the appeal  should  have
       been dismissed.

    3. I begin by considering exactly what the First-tier Tribunal decided.

    4. The claimant first entered the United Kingdom as a student  in  2011
       with leave to remain until April 2013.  He applied unsuccessfully to
       extend that leave and his appeal against refusal was dismissed on  7
       March 2014.

    5. It was the Secretary of State's case  that  the  claimant  had  used
       deception when he had applied to extend his leave.  He had relied on
       a TOEIC certificate from the Educational Testing Services which  had
       been cancelled because the test organisers were  satisfied  that  it
       had been obtained fraudulently using a proxy test taker.

    6. The Secretary of State refused the application for leave  to  remain
       on human rights grounds in part because the  claimant  had  obtained
       the test certificate fraudulently.  According to  the  Secretary  of
       State the claimant had been deceitful and, therefore,  his  presence
       in the United Kingdom was not conducive to the public good.

    7. The Secretary of State also considered  the  claimant's  case  under
       paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and found  there  were  no
       "very significant  obstacles"  to  his  integration  in  Sri  Lanka.
       However the Secretary of State accepted that the  claimant  and  his
       wife had a genuine and subsisting relationship.

    8. The claimant insisted that he had not been  dishonest  when  he  had
       obtained his ETS language  certificate.   The  First-tier  Tribunal,
       rightly, noted that it was for the Secretary of State to  prove  the
       facts relied on to support that  contention  and  having  heard  the
       claimant give evidence about how he attended  the  test  centre  and
       conducted himself there the judge was  not  satisfied  that  he  had
       obtained the test certificate improperly and resolved  that  dispute
       in the claimant's favour.  Importantly, that decision has  not  been
       the subject of any challenge.

    9. The judge noted that the Secretary of State's  reasons  for  finding
       the claimant unsuitable for leave had been answered.  However  there
       were still two concerns.

   10. The first was that the claimant relied on his wife's income and  his
       wife did not earn sufficient money.  At the date of decision it  was
       clear that her earnings did not match or exceed the sum of �18,600.

   11. Time had passed between the application and the hearing and  at  the
       date of hearing there was evidence that the claimant's wife  was  in
       regular work and was earning a  monthly  sum  that  grossed  out  to
       approximately �18,720 in a year but there was no P60  to  show  that
       that was her annual earnings.

   12. The judge said at paragraph 40:

  "Suffice it to say that I make no findings of fact as to what the  wife's
  current earnings are but it would seem that at the  date  of  application
  she did not meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM.  That is  not
  to say that she does not do so now."

   13. It was also noted that  the  claimant  had  not  got  proof  of  his
       competence in the use of the English  language.   Whilst  the  judge
       accepted that it had not been shown that the Appellant had  obtained
       the certificate dishonestly the certificate had been  cancelled  and
       therefore was not proof of his competence.

   14. The judge then directed himself that the claimant did not  meet  the
       requirements of Appendix FM "unless EX.1 applies".

   15. The judge was satisfied that  the  claimant  is  in  a  genuine  and
       subsisting relationship with a British citizen and he went on to ask
       himself if there  were  "insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
       continuing in Sri Lanka."

   16. The judge accepted that the claimant's wife feared returning to  Sri
       Lanka.  She is the daughter of someone who had suffered  persecution
       there and was recognised as a refugee.  She would also lose her  job
       and family ties in the United Kingdom  would  be  disrupted  if  she
       chose to leave.

   17. The claimant's wife did not allege that she risked persecution.  She
       had no political profile.  She  would  be  returning  as  a  British
       citizen living with her husband to the country where she  had  lived
       until 2006.  The judge said:

  "While I fully understand that she has serious misgivings about returning
  to Sri Lanka I cannot find that she would  be  at  risk  because  of  her
  relationship to her father or  that  she  would  encounter  very  serious
  hardship with him if she returned.  In short I do not find that EX.1  can
  be relied upon."

   18. The judge also found  that  there  would  be  no  obstacles  to  the
       claimant's integration into Sri Lanka.  His parents live  there  and
       could accommodate him.

   19. The judge expressly directed his attention to Section  117B  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  This Act  establishes
       by statute that certain things are in the  public  interest.   These
       include  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control   and
       immigrants speaking  the  English  language  and  being  financially
       independent so that they can integrate  into  society  and  are  not
       burdensome to the taxpayer.  The same Section also  prescribes  that
       "little weight" should be given to a private life or a  relationship
       formed with a qualifying partner at a time when a person is  in  the
       United Kingdom unlawfully.  It further prescribes that little weight
       should be given to a private life established by a person at a  time
       when the person's immigration status is precarious.  It  then  makes
       provisions for appellants who have children which  are  clearly  not
       relevant here.

   20. The judge then found that the claimant speaks English.  This finding
       was based on the fact that he had undertaken a college course in the
       English language and gave his evidence in English.  The  judge  said
       "It seems likely that he would pass the language test".

   21. The judge found the claimant was not financially independent because
       he was not able to work but he is an intelligent young man who would
       get work when he could.  The judge found that the claimant had never
       been in the United Kingdom  unlawfully.   He  had  always  been  the
       beneficiary of leave even if it  was  only  leave  extended  by  his
       making an application.

   22. The judge then considered the financial requirements and the English
       language certificate.  As evidence had been  provided  to  show  the
       wife does earn in excess of �18,600 the judge found that  there  was
       no reason why an out of country application could not succeed.   The
       judge said, at paragraph 57:

  "On a balance of probability [the claimant] should have no difficulty  in
  obtaining a valid language certificate.  In addition I take into  account
  that [the Presenting Officer]  made  no  attempts  to  suggest  that  the
  requirements of Appendix FM were not met."

   23. The judge found the claimant had established that an out of  country
       application made by him in by Sri Lanka would probably  succeed  and
       therefore the weight to be  attached  to  the  requirement  that  he
       should return to Sri Lanka to make an  out  of  country  application
       reduced.

   24. He allowed the appeal.

   25. The respondent's grounds rely on case law.

   26. Particularly they refer to Jeunesse v Netherlands [2014]  ECHR  1036
       where the Court said at paragraph 108:

  "Another important consideration is whether family life was created at  a
  time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status  of
  one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within  the
  Host State would from the outset be precarious.  It is the  Court's  well
  established case law that, where this is the case, it is likely  only  to
  be in exceptional circumstances that  the  removal  of  the  non-national
  family member will constitute a violation of Article 8 ..."

   27. That case was in the minds of the Tribunal when it decided the  case
       of Rajendran (section 117B - family life) [2016] UKUT  00138  (IAC).
       There the Tribunal confirmed that although not a point considered in
       Section 117B the wording of that Section did not  mean  a  court  or
       Tribunal should disregard the fact that a person's family  life  was
       developed when that person's  status  was  precarious.  Even  though
       Section 117B did not require that "family life" established  when  a
       person's immigration status was precarious should  be  given  little
       weight  the  fact  that  family  life  was   established   in   such
       circumstances was  something  to  consider.   It  appears  that  the
       jurisprudence of European Court of Human Rights is less generous  to
       an  applicant  than  is  United  Kingdom  statue  law  but  as   the
       considerations by required  by  the  Act  are  not  intended  to  be
       exhaustive or restrictive the considerations recognised by the Court
       of Human Rights have to be considered.

   28. The Secretary of State also relied on the  decision  of  R  (on  the
       application of Chen) v SSHD (Appendix FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary
       separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC).

   29. At Paragraph 39 in Chen the Upper Tribunal makes  clear  that  cases
       where human rights prevent the Secretary of State requiring a person
       to remove from the United Kingdom to apply to return are not limited
       to cases involving children. However I reject as plainly  wrong  the
       Secretary of State's contention that the Judge erred by  "placing  a
       positive  value  under  the   public   interest   consideration   on
       appellant's intention".  This criticism is a reference to  paragraph
       55 of the Decision and  Reasons  where  the  judge  found  that  the
       claimant was not presently financially independent but could  become
       so.  The Judge's accepted that the claimant  was  dependent  on  his
       wife and therefore was not presently independent. His point was that
       the wife's earnings were sufficient and, as  he  was  conducting  an
       article 8 balancing exercise rather than asking himself  if  certain
       defined criteria were met, the judge gave some  positive  weight  to
       the  claimant's  prospects.  I  see  nothing  wrong  in  that.  This
       assessment was independent of the finding that  the  claimant  would
       probably meet the rules and is not  inconsistent  with  his  finding
       that the claimant could be maintained  without  recourse  to  public
       funds at the date of decision. That he was employable  is  a  modest
       positive factor because it goes  to  the  prospects  of  integration
       which is in the public good. It is unlikely that  the  prospects  of
       getting work could, of itself, justify a decision to allow an appeal
       but that is not what has happened here.

   30. Nevertheless I can  see  considerable  merit  in  the  Secretary  of
       State's case.  The claimant is somebody who is  not  entitled  under
       the Rules to remain in the United Kingdom.  The Rules require him to
       leave the United Kingdom and make an  application  to  return  as  a
       spouse if that is what he wishes to  do.   It  is  likely,  but  not
       certain, that he would satisfy the requirements of the Rules but  at
       the date of the Secretary of State's  decision  and  the  First-tier
       Tribunal's decision it appears that he did not.  He did not have the
       necessary certificate and there was no proof that his wife had  been
       earning money for long enough to show an annual income in excess  of
       or matching the required amount.   Further,  as  the  Tribunal  made
       clear in Chen, it is for the claimant to make out his case that  the
       temporary separation that could be expected  in  the  event  of  his
       leaving  and  making  an  application   to   return   would   be   a
       disproportionate  interference  with  protected  rights.   This   is
       something that has not been addressed.

   31. In her statement dated 26 September 2016 the  claimant's  wife  said
       that she was concerned about  the  claimant's  safety  and  she  was
       concerned that  she  and  her  husband  would  be  separated  for  a
       considerable period if he left to make an application.   She  refers
       to no objective evidence to justify these expressed  concerns.   The
       claimant addressed the point at paragraph 5 in his witness statement
       dated 26 September 2016 (page 2 in the  bundle)  and  said  that  he
       expected they would be separated for about three months.  I  see  no
       reason to doubt that time estimate and I accept it.

   32. I do not see how the judge could possibly  have  concluded,  had  he
       considered the point, that the separation would be excessive.  It is
       understandable that a husband and wife want to live together but the
       claimant contemplated separation for  about  three  months  and  the
       claimant's wife could continue to live with her parents.  It is very
       hard to see anything particularly burdensome about a separation  for
       the purpose of applying in the required way.  No such case has  been
       made out except by an unjustified assertion of excessive delay.

   33. Ms Tobin referred me to the decision of the Supreme Court in  R  (on
       the application of Agyarko) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11  and  particularly
       to paragraph 51 where Lord Reed said:

  "Whether the applicant  is  in  the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully,  or  is
  entitled to remain in the UK only temporarily, however, the  significance
  of this consideration depends on what  the  outcome  of  the  immigration
  control might otherwise be.  For example, if an applicant would otherwise
  be automatically deported as a foreign criminal, then the weight  of  the
  pubic interest in his or her removal will generally be very considerable.
   If, on the other hand, an applicant - even if  residing  in  the  United
  Kingdom unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted leave to  enter,
  at least if an application were made from  outside  the  UK,  then  there
  might be no public  interest  in  his  or  her  removal.   The  point  is
  illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba v Secretary  of  State  for  the
  Home Department."

   34. The decision in Chikwamba is reported at [2008] UKHL 40.  It must be
       emphasised the claimant in that case was a citizen of  Zimbabwe  and
       the mother of a small child.  Her removal for the purposes of making
       an application to return would have involved considerable disruption
       in the life of the child either by reason of  the  appellant  taking
       the child to the economically difficult country of Zimbabwe  without
       the father or leaving the father to look  after  the  child  in  the
       United Kingdom while the mother made an application.  Lord Scott  of
       Foscote was particularly  perturbed  and  wanted  to  emphasise  the
       judgment of the court by adding his own short judgment in  which  he
       was very critical of the  Secretary  of  State.  He  said  that  the
       justification for the policy was that it was policy.  He said  "This
       is elevating policy to dogma.  Kafka would have enjoyed  it."   Lord
       Scott  clearly  would  not.  If  I  might  respectfully  say  so,  I
       understand that. The Secretary of State's policy does not  have  the
       weight of statute. Applying immigration rules very  often  (in  fact
       almost always) interferes with a person's private  and  family  life
       but  very  often   the   proposed   interference   is   lawful   and
       proportionate. The decision in Chikwamba is a sharp reminder not  to
       lose sight of the harm that enforcing immigration policy can  to  do
       human relationships and to remember that is might not be justified.

   35. However, Chikwamba is not to be understood as a general  licence  to
       rewrite the requirements of the Immigration Rules  or  to  determine
       that  every  example  of  following  them  strictly   would   be   a
       disproportionate interference in a person's private and family life.

   36. There are obvious policy considerations that require consistency  in
       enforcing the Rules.  It is not fair to applicants who would like to
       remain in the United Kingdom with their partners but who  choose  to
       return to their country of nationality and make  an  application  in
       accordance with the Rules even though they  find  that  disagreeable
       and inconvenient to  see  that  people  who  ignore  the  Rules  are
       indulged.  Further, having  clear  rules  simplifies  the  decision-
       making process and encourages predictable outcomes. These things are
       clearly desirable for the sake of good administration. This  present
       case is not a case where the separation would involve  the  sort  of
       difficulties that existed in Chikwamba.

   37. If I had had to decide the appeal I would not have allowed it.

   38. I have to decide if the First-tier Tribunal was  entitled  to  reach
       the conclusion that it did.  I have decided that it was not.  I  see
       two problems.  Firstly the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  appreciate
       that the proper  consideration  of  Article  8  in  accordance  with
       established jurisprudence shows that the claimant having established
       a private and family life when he was not entitled to remain in  the
       United Kingdom as a telling and significant point in determining the
       article 8 balancing  exercise.  This  jurisprudence  should  not  be
       ignored even though it is not elevated to a statutory  consideration
       under section 117B.  It  is  impossible  not  to  have  considerable
       sympathy for a judge who appeared to be trying very hard  to  follow
       the Act but as was made plain in Rajendran even though not mentioned
       in the statute the fact that family life was  established  when  the
       immigration status was precarious is a relevant factor  that  should
       be considered.  It was not.

   39. Secondly I find the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  overemphasised  the
       effect of Chikwamba which was not intended to overrule policy but to
       remind decision makers  that  sometimes  policy  is  not  sufficient
       reason to  justify  interference  and  in  those  circumstances  the
       Tribunal and courts should not be reluctant to allow appeals.  In my
       judgment this is not such as case.   The  factors  that  would  make
       application of policy oppressive or otherwise  wrong  do  not  exist
       here.

   40. It follows therefore that I set aside the decision of the First-tier
       Tribunal it erred it law and I substitute a decision dismissing  the
       claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State.



Notice of Decision

     The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed. I set  aside  the  decision
of the First-tier Tribunal  and  I  substitute  a  decision  dismissing  the
claimant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision.
