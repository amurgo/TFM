For the Appellant: Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents: Miss A Seehra, Counsel

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Parties and Proceedings

    1. The appellant in this appeal is the entry clearance  officer  (ECO).
       The respondents  are  referred  to  collectively  hereafter  as  the
       claimants and references to the claimant are to Mrs Anita Rani.  Mrs
       Rani was born on 30th May 1970; Mr Navdeep Singh was  born  on  15th
       December 1996 and Mr Sandeep Singh was born on 30th  November  1997.
       The claimants are all nationals  of  India;  the  second  and  third
       appellants are the dependent children of Mrs  Rani.  In  a  decision
       made on 20th June 2013 the ECO refused their applications for  entry
       clearance to the United Kingdom as the partner  and  children  of  a
       person settled in the United Kingdom.


    2. They appealed the refusal  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  P  A
       Corben (the Judge) sitting at Richmond  Magistrates'  Court  on  8th
       April 2014. In a  determination  dated  20th  June  2014  the  Judge
       dismissed the appeals under the Immigration Rules but  allowed  them
       under Article 8 of the ECHR.  Permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
       Tribunal against the Judge's Article 8 decision was granted on  14th
       July 2014 to the ECO by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Garratt
       for the following reasons:


         The (ECO) argues that the determination is flawed  because,  before
         allowing the appeal on human rights grounds, the  Judge  failed  to
         follow the guidance of the Upper Tribunal set out in Gulshan [2013]
         UKUT 00640 (IAC) and related case law by considering whether  there
         were compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the
         rules to consider  claims outside them.  In this respect it is also
         pointed out that there was no analysis by the Judge of the  ability
         of the appellants to submit a further application or  the  parties'
         inability to meet the minimum income threshold under the Rules.


         The grounds are arguable.  The determination does not show that the
         Judge proceeded to consider human rights issues outside  the  Rules
         by applying the "compelling circumstances" test or that  the  judge
         considered the shortfall  in  maintenance  having  regard  to  both
         Appendix FM and FM-SE.

    3. The matter accordingly came before me  for  an  initial  hearing  to
       determine whether the making  of  the  decision  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law.


Consideration of Issues and Submissions


    4. The evidence before the Judge was  that  the  sponsor  and  claimant
       married in India on 10th March 1996; their two sons  were  born  and
       have remained there with their mother.  The sponsor  left  India  in
       late 1999 arriving  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  2000;  he  entered
       illegally and made an unsuccessful asylum claim.  He has lived  here
       ever since. None of  the  claimants  has  travelled  to  the  United
       Kingdom in the last 10 years but they maintain frequent contact with
       the sponsor through his visits to India and by telephone calls.  All
       parties are citizens of India and the sponsor was granted indefinite
       leave to remain in the United Kingdom on 10th August 2011.


    5. The judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor and found him  to  be
       credible. He accepted the evidence of the relationships between  the
       sponsor and claimants and their genuine intention to  live  together
       in the United Kingdom as a family unit. The Judge accepted that  the
       accommodation requirements of the Immigration  Rules  were  met  and
       found that the sponsor needed to show a minimum annual gross  income
       of �24,800 to meet the financial requirements. The applications were
       made on 24th March 2013 and the judge found that at this  date  none
       of the claimants was able to meet the financial requirements because
       the sponsor was at the relevant time earning less than �16,000 gross
       per annum, although from May 2013 he had been  employed  on  a  PAYE
       basis earning �25,200 per annum by January 2014.

    6. The grounds of appeal relied upon by  Mr  Nath  at  the  hearing  on
       behalf of the ECO are that  the  Judge  allowed  the  appeals  under
       Article  8  of  the  ECHR,  after  finding  that   the   maintenance
       requirements  of  Appendix  FM  could  not  be  met,  without  first
       directing  himself  as   to   any   compelling   circumstances   not
       sufficiently recognised by the Rules in accordance with R (Nagre)  v
       SSHD  [2013] EWCH 720 (Admin).  The failure of the Judge to consider
       any such compelling circumstances is  submitted  to  be  a  material
       error of law. Appendix FM is submitted to sufficiently recognise and
       cater for the circumstances of this case such  that  there  were  no
       grounds to go beyond the Rules.

    7. The grounds for the ECO further assert  that  the  case  of  Gulshan
       [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) makes clear that  an  Article  8  assessment
       should  only  be  carried  out  when  compelling  circumstances  not
       recognised by the Rules are  present;  the  Secretary  of  State  is
       entitled to set a minimum income threshold to ensure that those  who
       seek to establish family life in the United Kingdom have the ability
       to financially support themselves such that the migrant partner does
       not become a burden upon  the  tax  payer  and  is  better  able  to
       integrate into British society.   Only if there  are  arguably  good
       grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules  is  it
       necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider  compelling
       circumstances not sufficiently recognised by them.

    8. The grounds of appeal further assert that in accordance with Gulshan
       at this stage an appeal should  only  be  allowed  where  there  are
       exceptional circumstances, namely that  refusal  would  lead  to  an
       unjustifiably harsh outcome.  It  is  submitted  that  there  is  no
       prejudice to the claimants flowing from the ECO's approach to  their
       applications; family life could continue in India and the Judge  had
       failed to consider this or the ability of the claimants to submit  a
       further application once the sponsor is in a position  to  meet  the
       financial requirements. The Judge has found no  unjustifiably  harsh
       outcome and the ECO's decision simply preserve the status quo.

    9. Mr Nath  relied  on  the  continuing  grounds  of  appeal  that  the
       claimants failed  by  a  significant  margin  and  with  a  lack  of
       specified evidence to meet the requirements of the Rules.  In  these
       circumstances Article 8 should not be used to circumvent  the  Rules
       or to allow appeals.  The claimant married the sponsor in India  and
       there could be no legitimate expectation that family life  could  be
       established in the United Kingdom; no evidence is provided  to  show
       why family life could not continue  there  and  the  Judge  attached
       undue significant weight to the sponsor's 14-year  presence  in  the
       United Kingdom after his illegal entry.

   10. The Judge is submitted  to  have  failed  to  take  account  of  the
       sponsor's visits to India on several occasions since  the  grant  of
       his indefinite leave to remain. One such visit was for the  duration
       of 3 months and after the resolution of a land dispute on  which  an
       asylum claim was based by  the  sponsor  he  is  able,  on  his  own
       admission, to return to India without  difficulty.  The  grounds  of
       appeal for the ECO draw attention to the Judge's  finding  that  the
       sponsor's reasons for leaving India were not credible.

   11. The public interest in maintaining immigration control by  requiring
       the Immigration Rules to be met in this case  is  submitted  not  to
       lead  to  a  disproportionately  detrimental  effect  on  the   best
       interests of the children who have  resided  with  their  mother  in
       India and maintain contact with their father through  visits.   This
       situation can continue until such time as the  requirements  of  the
       Rules can be met and the Judge has attached too much weight  to  the
       best interests of teenage  children  whose  lives  have  been  spent
       settled in India without their father. The evidence  does  not  show
       their best interests to be served by coming to the United Kingdom.


   12. No Rule 24 response was submitted for the claimants in  response  to
       the grounds of appeal and Miss Seehra  confirmed  that  no  skeleton
       argument had been drafted.  However,  she  outlined  the  claimants'
       opposition to the appeal in her oral  submissions  as  follows.  She
       accepted that there is some foundation to the grounds and  that  the
       Judge had not looked at any compelling or exceptional  circumstances
       but he had nonetheless done everything required on  a  consideration
       of the case outside the Rules. Miss Seehra submitted that  there  is
       no "exceptional circumstances" test; the claimants' circumstances do
       not have to be elevated to "compelling" and  case  law  makes  clear
       throughout that there is no test of exceptionality.


   13. The judge was submitted to have considered the Immigration Rules  in
       detail and to have found the sponsor's income to fluctuate,  as  set
       out in paragraph 30 of the determination. The ECO had considered the
       application on the basis  of  documents  only,  having  doubted  the
       relationships claimed between the sponsor and claimants.  The  Judge
       had, however, accepted the existence of a family unit and found  the
       claimants to present no burden upon the state. He  took  account  of
       savings and the claimant's ability and  intention  to  work  in  the
       United Kingdom. The ECO had embarked upon no so  such  consideration
       in the light of his findings; the judge did not take account of post-
       decision evidence - he looked at the position at  the  time  of  the
       decision.


   14. Miss Seehra submitted that  the  Judge  had  properly  assessed  the
       financial situation in the light of the evidence  of  the  sponsor's
       changed employment status to that  of  an  employee,  his  increased
       earnings at the date of decision, available savings and the  earning
       ability and capacity of his claimant spouse. Miss  Seehra  submitted
       that the Judge had carried out a proper assessment under  Article  8
       of all the evidence including the legitimate aim,  the  burden  upon
       the state and the position of the children.  The children wished  to
       be reunited with their father and the Judge was entitled to conclude
       that the continuing separation of the family was  neither  necessary
       nor proportionate; he had made a finding on the unreasonableness  of
       the sponsor to relocate abroad.


   15. Having found the requirements of the Immigration Rules not to be met
       The Judge moved directly to a free-wheeling consideration of Article
       8 under the ECHR and found  that  it  was  not  reasonable  for  the
       sponsor to give up his home and employment in the United Kingdom  to
       embark upon the uncertainty of seeking employment overseas. He  took
       account of the  sponsor's  increased  earnings  after  the  date  of
       decision and he found as  a  primary  consideration  that  the  best
       interests of the children were met by  being  re-united  with  their
       father.  He  found  the  refusal  of  entry   clearance   in   these
       circumstances to be disproportionate.


   16. Miss Seehra referred to MM (Lebanon) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985,  at
       paragraphs 130, 159 and  160  in  particular,  in  relation  to  the
       lawfulness of the ECO's decision in the light  of  no  consideration
       having been given to the claimants' position outside the  Rules  and
       no consideration of proportionally;  there  had  been  no  two-stage
       approach adopted to the applications.  At the conclusion of all  the
       submissions I reserved my decision on error of law and  heard  brief
       submissions from the representatives as to the  manner  of  remaking
       the decision should I find that the First-tier decision must be  set
       aside.


   17. Having considered all the submissions I find merit in those for  the
       claimants that the Judge did not make a material error of  law.  The
       Judge embarked upon an Article 8  consideration  of  the  claimants'
       position by conducting a  balancing  exercise  within  the  approved
       structure set out in Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27  in  circumstances
       where the ECO had not done so in the light of adverse findings about
       the genuine nature of the relationship  between  the  parties.   The
       Judge reached favourable conclusions about the relationships between
       the claimants and sponsor and found the sponsor to be credible about
       the core aspects of the appeal before him.


   18. This is an out of country case where the discretion afforded in  in-
       country cases is not applicable, as submitted by Miss Seehra for the
       claimants. There was no reference to proportionality  when  the  ECO
       refused the applications so that their consideration with  reference
       to the Rules only did not provide a comprehensive  consideration  of
       all relevant Article 8 factors. I am satisfied that  the  Judge  did
       not circumvent the Rules by using Article 8  as  he  carried  out  a
       proper analysis of  the  financial  evidence  under  the  Rules  and
       carried forward his findings into the proportionality assessment and
       gave appropriate weight, at paragraph 35 of  his  determination,  to
       the public interest.


   19. At paragraph 35 of his determination the Judge stated  that:  "there
       is no doubt that there is  a  strong  public  interest  in  refusing
       applicant entry clearance if they  thought  to  be  likely  to  have
       recourse to public funds".  He found the sponsor's situation to have
       improved to the extent that the financial requirements of the  Rules
       were by then met taking account of the evidence as set out above  in
       Miss Seehra's submissions. In these circumstances I  find  that  the
       Judge  did  not   circumvent   the   Rules.    In   conducting   the
       proportionality assessment I am satisfied that the  Judge  paid  due
       regard to both  the  public  interest  in  the  enforcement  of  the
       Immigration Rules and the particular family circumstances and rights
       of the claimants and sponsor.

   20. The Judge took account of the best interests of the children in  the
       balancing exercise and found that they were not met by  the  refusal
       of their applications. I find that the Judge was entitled to come to
       this conclusion, contrary to the submission for  the  ECO  that  too
       much weight was attached to these interests. Looking at the decision
       as a whole I find that the lack of explicit reference to  case  law,
       including Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640  (IAC),  in  the  Judge's  self-
       direction does not amount to  any  material  error  of  law  as  his
       reasons show  in  effect  that  he  considered  the  claimants'  and
       sponsor's  particular  situation  to  amount  to   exceptional   and
       compelling circumstances in the context of Article  8  which  tipped
       the balance in their favour.  The  decision  of  the  Judge  is  not
       submitted on behalf of the ECO to be perverse.


   21. I find that the making of the First-tier Tribunal decision  allowing
       the claimants' appeals under Article 8 of the ECHR did  not  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law and the decision  therefore
       stands.


Summary of Decisions

   22.  The  making  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  allowing  the
       claimants' appeals under Article 8 of the ECHR did not  involve  the
       making of an error on a point of law.


   23. The decision accordingly stands.


   24. The ECO's appeal to the Upper Tribunal does not succeed.

Anonymity


I find no reason to change the decision of the First-tier Tribunal not  make
an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
(Procedure) Rules 2005.
