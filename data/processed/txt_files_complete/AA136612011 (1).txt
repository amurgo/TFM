                                   Between

                                MR SAMIR [Z]
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Nicholson (instructed by Greater Manchester
                    Immigration Aid Unit)
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal, with  permission,  by  the
         Appellant in relation to a Decision and Reasons  of  Judge  P  J  G
         White promulgated  in  January  2012  by  which  he  dismissed  the
         Appellant's asylum and humanitarian protection claim.




      2. The case has had a tortuous  journey  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
         arrived before me with permission to appeal  granted  by  the  Vice
         President of the Upper Tribunal after an order of the High Court.

      3. The alleged error of law by the First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  in
         what is unarguably an otherwise careful and detailed decision,  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to treat the Appellant as a  minor
         or to consider his best interests. At the date of the  hearing  the
         Appellant, a citizen of Afghanistan, was two weeks shy of his  18th
         birthday.

      4. Mr McVeety, on behalf of the Secretary of State conceded  that  the
         First-tier Tribunal had made a material error of law and  that  the
         matter  should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
         rehearing on all matters.

      5. In light of the Respondent's concession I set aside the decision of
         the First-tier Tribunal and allow the appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
         to the extent that it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
         full rehearing on all matters.



Signed                              Date 12th December 2016
