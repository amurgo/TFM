Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Bhuiyan
For the Respondent:    Mr G Jack


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka.  On 11 December 2009  he  was
    granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    until 11 May 2011.  He then made an application  on  10  May  2011  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the points-
    based system. What then appears to  have  happened,  according  to  the
    appellant's witness statement, is that "on the day of the hearing,  the
    Secretary of State had withdrawn the decision in order to make a  fresh
    decision which was taking so long that I, on 29 September 2012, made  a
    fresh  application  with  all  relevant  documents".  I  note  that  29
    September 2012 is the date shown on the application form  appearing  in
    the respondent's bundle. Somewhat confusingly  in  the  refusal  letter
    reference is made to the application of 10 May  2011  rather  than  the
    application of 29 September  2012.  For  all  practical  purposes  this
    appears to make little difference to  the  matters  in  issue  in  this
    appeal.

 2. The application was refused on 20 February 2013 and a decision was made
    at the same time to  remove  the  appellant  from  the  UK  by  way  of
    directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.

 3. The appellant appealed.  In a determination promulgated on  21  October
    2013 the appeal was dismissed.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found
    that  the  appellant  had  to  demonstrate  access  to  �2,000  for   a
    consecutive 28 day period.  In support of his application the appellant
    submitted evidence of funds in the "Sanasa  Business  Development  Bank
    ltd" (hereafter "SBDB ltd") in Sri Lanka.  However, the respondent  did
    not accept this evidence because the  bank  is  not  regulated  by  the
    Central Bank of Sri Lanka and as a consequence did not  find  that  the
    appellant  had  access  to  �2,000  for  the  specified  period.    The
    respondent did, however, accept that the appellant had paid his  course
    fees of �2,500 for the first year  of  his  course  which  was  another
    requirement of the PBS under "Maintenance (Funds)".

 4. In his witness statement which was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    the appellant  asserted  that  at  the  time  of  the  application  the
    respondent did not issue a list of financial  institutions  which  were
    acceptable to her.  The appellant further asserted that the  respondent
    did not inform him of any changes to  requirements  and  therefore  the
    respondent ought not to rely on the grounds upon which the  appellant's
    application has been refused.

 5. The second limb of the appellant's case was that SBDB ltd  may  not  be
    regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka but it  is  regulated  under
    statutory  provisions.  He  submitted  a  list   of   those   financial
    institutions  regulated  under  that  scheme.   Therefore   the   funds
    available in SBDB ltd should have  been  taken  into  account  and  the
    appeal allowed.

 6. The judge was unpersuaded by  this  argument.  Although  the  appellant
    produced a pamphlet showing institutions authorised to accept  deposits
    from  the  public  which  included  Sanasa  Development  Bank   Limited
    (hereafter "SDB ltd") this was not the same name as the  bank  referred
    to in the application form which at D1 of the  respondent's  bundle  is
    referred to as SBDB ltd and at D2, SBDB (not ltd).

 7. The judge went on to state that the respondent contacted  SDB  ltd  and
    was told that it does not have an office at  744  Kandy  Road,  Thorana
    Junction, Kelaniya and it is not the same bank as SBDB ltd.

 8. As a result of this the judge went on to find that  the  appellant  has
    not demonstrated that the bank in which he holds funds is regulated  by
    the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the purpose of the Immigration  Rules
    and although the appellant claims that the bank is  regulated  under  a
    statutory scheme the bank does not appear on  that  list.   Although  a
    bank bearing a similar name to  that  bank  does  appear  it  has  been
    contacted by the respondent to learn that they are not  the  same.   On
    balance therefore he found that the appellant has  not  discharged  the
    burden of proof.

 9. The judge then considered the "new" Article 8 Rules and found that  the
    appellant does not meet those and the appellant does not appear to rely
    on Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Convention  either.   He  therefore
    dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

The Error of Law Finding

10. The first thing to note is that the judge did not deal with the Section
    47 removal direction.  It is common ground that that was not  a  lawful
    decision having been made in the decision letter prior to 8  May  2013.
    Mr Jack sought permission to withdraw that decision and there being  no
    objection to this course of action I allowed him to do so.

11. It is clear from Appendix P that an  applicant  will  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the rules if he provides  documents  from  a  financial
    institution which is on a list of those  that  "do  not  satisfactorily
    verify financial statements".  Appendix  P  also  contains  a  list  of
    financial institutions "whose financial statements are accepted".  What
    of those institutions that are not on the list of  those  that  do  not
    satisfactorily verify financial statements or those that do not  appear
    on the list of those whose  financial  statements  are  accepted?  That
    situation appears to be covered at paragraph 6 of Appendix P where  the
    following is stated:-

         "6.  The  UK  Border  Agency  will  continue  to  verify  financial
             information from other institutions on a  case-by-case  basis,
             and may refuse applications on the basis of  these  individual
             checks."

12. That was the  relevant  part  of  the  Appendix  that  applied  to  the
    appellant at date of application (either on 10 May 2011 or 29 September
    2012) and at the respondent's decision on  20  February  2013.   It  is
    reasonable to assume that the  overseas  document  verification  report
    that is in  the  file  was  part  of  the  checking  of  the  financial
    information "from other institutions" referred to  at  paragraph  6  of
    Appendix P.  The problem with that report is that the "contact history"
    referred to was made to the operations manager at SDB ltd and not  SBDB
    ltd which is where the appellant maintains that he has a fixed deposit.
     It is hardly surprising therefore that the operations manager  of  SDB
    ltd confirmed that SDB ltd  did  not  have  a  branch  at  the  address
    mentioned in the  letters  confirming  the  deposit.   It  is  easy  to
    understand  that  the  operations  manager  stated  that  he  had  been
    receiving verification requests from other missions regarding SBDB  ltd
    because the names of the banks are so similar.

13. The judge hearing this matter in the First-tier Tribunal made errors of
    law firstly because he did not deal with the Section 47 point but  also
    because he appears to have taken  against  the  appellant  in  part  by
    reason of enquiries made of a bank which was not the bank in which  the
    appellant ever claimed he has deposited funds. It is hardly  surprising
    therefore that the bank branch address  given  by  the  bank  of  which
    enquiries were made was not the  same  as  the  address  in  which  the
    appellant claims to have funds. There is a further point that it is not
    necessarily fatal to the appellant's claim that the bank  in  which  he
    has funds does not appear on the list of financial  institutions  whose
    financial statements are accepted considering that list only came  into
    existence on 6 April 2013 i.e. post decision.

14. The judge erred in the ways described and  those  errors  are  material
    because it could not be said that despite the errors the outcome of the
    appeal would inevitably be the same. I therefore set aside the decision
    and announced that I was doing so at the hearing.

The Resumed Hearing

15. Both representatives told me that they were prepared to  continue  with
    the resumed hearing of the appeal straightaway. Mr Bhuiyan did not wish
    to call the appellant to give evidence.  In his submissions Mr  Bhuiyan
    said that the verification report cannot be applicable to  this  appeal
    because that was not the bank where the appellant has his funds.  As at
    the date of decision there was no requirement for the bank in which the
    appellant does have the funds to be regulated by the  Central  Bank  of
    Sri Lanka.  Following the rejection of the  appellant's  application  a
    letter was written by SBDB ltd to the Visa Officer  clearly  confirming
    that it is exempted  from  the  requirement  of  registering  with  the
    Central Bank of Sri Lanka  because  it  is  registered  under  the  Co-
    operative Act No. 5 of 1972.  This proved that the  bank  is  a  proper
    bank and the  appellant  held  the  funds  at  the  relevant  time  and
    therefore came within the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

My Findings

16. It does not appear to be in issue  that  the  amount  of  Rs  2,000,000
    equates to an amount of approximately �9,500 which  is  clearly  a  far
    greater sum than the �2,000 earlier referred to. The central  issue  is
    whether the appellant had the relevant amount of at least �2000 at  the
    date of application as per paragraph 1A of Appendix C of the Rules  and
    had at least that amount for the relevant 28 day period.

17. The evidence that was before the Secretary of State prior  to  date  of
    decision is at D1 of the refusal bundle  and  is  a  letter  on  headed
    notepaper with logo from SBDB ltd confirming that the appellant  has  a
    fixed  deposit  with  that  bank  for  the  period  of  02/07/2012   to
    02/07/2013. An investment number is also given. In addition  at  D2  of
    the refusal bundle there are fixed deposit details from the  same  bank
    (there is no reference to "limited" and the significance  or  otherwise
    of that has not been  explained  to  me)  confirming  the  same  thing.
    Conditions attached to the letter show that the deposit  is  fixed  for
    the period stated on the face of the receipt and the bank reserves  the
    right to  refuse  "pre-maturity  withdrawals"  but  may  consider  such
    withdrawals at its sole discretion. Additionally the deposit  could  be
    withdrawn on seven days notice subject to the bank's decision to accept
    such notice only up to the date of maturity of the deposit.

18. It is a moot point as to whether the appellant could be said to be  "in
    possession of �2000 for a consecutive 28 day period" when  his  ability
    to obtain funds is restricted in the way described. However,  that  was
    not a point that was taken in the  refusal  letter  by  the  respondent
    which refused the application because the  issuing  authority  was  not
    regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

19. It is also the case that the Policy Guidance for  Tier  4  applications
    made on or after 4 September 2012 at paragraph 156 states as follows: --



               "The evidence of money held must be of  cash  funds  in  the
               bank (this includes savings accounts  and  current  accounts
               even when notice must be given) - (my italics),  as  a  loan
               letter  or  letter  or  official  financial  or   government
               sponsorship available to the applicant.  Other  accounts  or
               financial instruments such  as  shares,  bonds,  overdrafts,
               credit  cards  and  pension  funds   are   not   acceptable,
               regardless of the notice period."

20. I was not addressed in any detail on the matter by the  representatives
    but although the money is said to be on fixed deposit there is capacity
    for it to be withdrawn on notice and that does not appear to offend the
    wording in the Policy Guidance.

21. I find on balance that SBDB ltd exists and that the  appellant  was  in
    possession of the requisite funds for the relevant period. There is the
    letter  accompanying  the  application  and  also  a  separate   letter
    confirming the balance of funds well in excess of the  �2000  required.
    There is also a letter written very shortly post decision by  SBDB  ltd
    complaining of the treatment  that  it  has  received  from  UK  Border
    Agency. These letters could  be  forgeries  but  there  is  no  serious
    suggestion that they are.

22. I take particular note of 1A (i) of Appendix C  which  states  that  no
    points will be awarded where specified documents show  that  the  funds
    are held in a financial institution listed in Appendix P  as  being  an
    institution  in  which  the  UK  Border  Agency  is  unable   to   make
    satisfactory verification checks  (inserted  as  from  20  July  2012).
    However, the bank in which the appellant has his funds is not  included
    in any such list. The check that was made was made to the wrong bank so
    it is not clear if or how  UK  Border  Agency  was  unable  to  make  a
    satisfactory verification check.

23. I note that the comments that appear on the verification  report  state
    that SBDB ltd is not regulated by the Central Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  and
    therefore according to PBS Rules the  funds  maintained  at  that  bank
    cannot be taken into account as available funds.

24. As to that point I refer to the pamphlet that has been produced by  the
    Central Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  dated  May  2006  which  sets  out  those
    institutions which are authorised to accept deposits from the public in
    that country.  It  states  that  licensed  commercial  banks,  licensed
    specialised banks and registered  finance  companies  have  been  given
    authority by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to "mobilise" deposits  from
    the public under the existing laws.  It  then  proceeds  "However,  co-
    operative societies registered under the Co-operative Societies Law No.
    5 of 1972  and  building  societies  incorporated  under  the  National
    Housing Act have been exempted from the requirement to obtain a licence
    from or to register with the Central Bank for  the  purpose  of  taking
    deposits".

25. The Tier 4 Policy Guidance at paragraph 181 sets out what documents can
    be used to show money available to the Tier  4  (General)  student.  At
    paragraph 181 iv "a letter from a financial  institution  regulated  by
    either the Financial Services Authority or, in  the  case  of  overseas
    accounts, the home regulator (official regulatory body for the  country
    the institution is in and where the money  is  held)  confirming  funds
    have been held for a consecutive 28 day period ending no more than  one
    month before the date of the application.

26. That Policy Guidance is not part of the Immigration Rules, or at  least
    it had not been incorporated into them at the date of  application  and
    does not therefore have the force of the Immigration Rules themselves.

27. It was not  until  6  April  2013  that  financial  institutions  whose
    financial statements are accepted either as licensed  commercial  banks
    or licensed specialised banks was inserted at Table 13 in  Appendix  P.
    It appears therefore that the practice to be followed in  the  case  of
    other financial institutions  is  set  out  in  paragraph  11  of  this
    determination namely that "The UK Border Agency will continue to verify
    financial information from other institutions on a case-by-case  basis,
    and may refuse applications on the basis of these individual checks."

Conclusions

28. On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied that the appellant meets
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules. It does not appear to be  an
    issue that the appellant has more than  sufficient  funds  in  a  fixed
    deposit account at the relevant time which is likely to be able  to  be
    taken out upon notice being given. The bank in which he has  the  money
    does not appear in the list  of  financial  institutions  that  do  not
    satisfactorily verify financial statements or indeed  in  the  list  of
    those whose financial statements are accepted. The respondent attempted
    to verify financial information  from  the  institution  in  which  the
    appellant had his money but contacted the wrong bank.

29. Although it is the case that certain banks in Sri Lanka have been given
    authority by the Central Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  to  "mobilise"  deposits
    certain co-operative societies are exempted  from  the  requirement  to
    obtain a licence from or to register with  the  Central  Bank  for  the
    purpose of taking deposits. However, it was not  until  after  date  of
    decision that there was a requirement for SBDB ltd to be  regulated  by
    the Central Bank and even then a question that I do not need to  answer
    is whether a bank registered under the Co-operative Societies Law No. 5
    of 1972 can be said not to be regulated in the manner required  by  the
    rules.

30. Viewed in the round the appellant has shown that he has access to �2000
    for the specified period required under the rules and thus this  appeal
    succeeds.



Decision

31. The First-tier Tribunal Judge erred for the reasons set out  above  and
    his decision is set aside.

32. Also for the reasons set out above the  appeal  is  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

33. No application for an anonymity  direction  was  made  to  me  and  the
    circumstances do not appear to warrant such a direction being made.   I
    therefore do not make one.
