                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Appellant Ms NY.  She is
    a citizen of Sri Lanka who had made a protection claim to the Secretary
    of State which was refused and which she  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal at a hearing on 5th October 2017 before Judge Farrelly.  In  a
    Decision and Reasons promulgated on 31st October  2017  Judge  Farrelly
    dismissed the appeal on all grounds.  Permission was granted by a Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal essentially on one of the three grounds.   I
    will turn to the three grounds when I set out the claim itself.

 2. The Appellant was born in Sri Lanka.  She  says  that  her  father  was
    involved with the LTTE as a result of which the whole family  left  Sri
    Lanka for Thailand and from there to Malaysia where they stayed  for  a
    significant period of time.  Whilst in Malaysia  they  were  under  the
    protection of and had the assistance of UNHCR and there was evidence to
    that effect.  The intention of the family had been  to  travel  to  the
    United States  but  there  was  a  difficulty  in  the  father  gaining
    permission to do so because of his  involvement  with  LTTE,  a  banned
    organisation.  It transpires that the Appellant's mother and sister are
    now in the United States, having been granted permission.   Her  father
    is not yet there.  She has a brother who is in the United  Kingdom  and
    he has been granted refugee status.

 3. The Appellant was educated in  Malaysia  and  indeed  had  a  place  at
    university.  For reasons which are uncertain, she returned to Sri Lanka
    where she lived with an uncle.  It is her claim  that  whilst  she  was
    there she was arrested, detained, beaten, abused and raped.  Her  uncle
    was able to secure her release and she was able to  obtain  a  passport
    and a student visa and come to the UK.   In  the  UK  she  stayed  with
    another family, who were known to her family, and  indeed  she  is  now
    engaged to be married to the son of that family.

 4. In her appeal before the First-tier Tribunal the Judge  considered  her
    reasoning for leaving Malaysia and returning to Sri Lanka and found  it
    inexplicable.  He also noted that she had been able to  obtain  both  a
    passport and visa to come to the UK, without  difficulty,  despite  the
    fact that there would have been scrutiny of her application by the High
    Commission.  She also had an English language certificate.   The  Judge
    noted that with her student application she  had  satisfied  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer that the course fees of over �12,000  had  been  paid
    and that she had some �10,000 to support her.  He concluded  from  that
    that she was a woman of substance.

 5. However, throughout the Decision and Reasons, the Judge concentrated, I
    find, on the motives for the Appellant returning to Sri Lanka which,  I
    agree do seem odd when the rest of the family were  pursuing  entry  to
    the United States.  Also he concentrated on the fact that it  may  well
    have been the case that she travelled to the UK and to  stay  with  the
    family, the son of whom is  now  her  fianc�,  as  part  of  the  plan.
    However that is not the whole story and that was  not  everything  that
    the Judge was tasked to decide.

 6. The Appellant's claim details very significant and serious  abuse.   It
    is set out in detail at C20 and 21 of the Respondent's bundle which  is
    the asylum interview.  There she gave great  detail  as  to  what  took
    place and further graphic detail is to  be  found  in  the  Appellant's
    witness statement.  It is fair to say that none of that is  dealt  with
    in  the  Judge's  Decision  and  Reasons  and  indeed  the  Judge,   in
    concentrating on the motivation of the Appellant,  has  not  given  any
    proper scrutiny to the actual protection claim.  It is  also  the  case
    that in her brother's protection application  many  of  the  background
    factors are the same.  His claim has been accepted and he is a refugee.
     Proper scrutiny of that fact and the fact that the Appellant therefore
    has a family background of LTTE connection has not  been  given  proper
    consideration either.  For those reasons I would set the  Decision  and
    Reasons aside.

 7. One of the other grounds upon which permission  to  appeal  was  sought
    criticised first of all a variety  of  grammatical  errors  and  typing
    errors which appear in the Decision.  I do not find that  they  are  in
    any way significant and certainly do not suggest that the Decision  had
    been rushed, as suggested.

 8. The second ground I am also unimpressed by.  It contains  phrases  like
    "the Judge constructed an elaborate scenario",  "it  was  an  elaborate
    conspiracy",  "wholesale  deception  and  conspiracy".   It  refers  to
    "scathingly hostile conspiracies", "a  fundamentally  unfair  hearing".
    Those accusations I find  are  unwarranted  and  have  no  place  in  a
    permission application.  A Judge is entitled to reach conclusions based
    on the evidence that he hears.  Neither of those grounds are  made  out
    and indeed were ill-advised in the first place.

 9. However, the third ground in relation to the  failure  to  make  proper
    findings in relation to the risk is made out and,  as  I  have  already
    indicated, sufficient to mean that the Decision and Reasons has  to  be
    set aside in its entirety with no findings preserved.  Because it is  a
    protection claim and because there are a lot of findings of fact to  be
    made, it is appropriate for the matter to be remitted to the First-tier
    Tribunal for a full rehearing on all matters. The  appropriate  hearing
    centre is Taylor House so to  that  extent  the  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal by the Appellant is allowed.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal at Taylor House for a full rehearing.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
