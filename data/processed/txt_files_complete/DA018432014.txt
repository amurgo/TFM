Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    By its Directions issued to the parties on 8 February 2016, the  Upper
      Tribunal  informed  the  parties,  for  the  reasons  given   in   the
      Directions,that it was of the preliminary view:

      i.    that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  should  be  set
           aside  on  the  ground  that  it  materially  erred  in  law  in
           dismissing the appellant's appeal on asylum,  human  rights  and
           under the Immigration Rules;

       ii.    that  it  should  proceed  to  re-make  the  decision  on  the
           appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse to revoke  the
           deportation order;  and

      iii.  that the appellant's appeal against the decision  to  refuse  to
           revoke the deportation order should be  allowed  on  the  ground
           that the decision to refuse to revoke the deportation  order  is
           not in accordance with the law, in that, it is unlawful for  the
           reasons given at para 1 of the Directions.
2.    The parties were allowed ten working days within which  to  object  to
      the Upper Tribunal's proposal. Neither party objected.

3.    This case was listed for hearing on 4 March  2016,  inadvertently,  it
      would appear. At the hearing, Mr Waheed and Mr Staunton agreed to  the
      Upper Tribunal's proposal.

4.    Given the terms of the respondent's letter dated 1  December  2015  by
      which she accepted, inter alia, that the deportation order  signed  on
      27 January 2004 is unlawful and that as a result, the decision  of  15
      September 2014 to refuse the revoke the deportation order is unlawful,
      I am satisfied that the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal R
      Callender Smith should be set aside on the  ground  that  he  material
      erred in law in dismissing the appellant's  appeal  on  asylum,  human
      rights and under the Immigration Rules. None  of  his  findings  shall
      stand.

5.    I therefore proceed to re-make the decision on the appellant's  appeal
      against the decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order.

6.    For the reasons given above, the decision  to  refuse  to  revoke  the
      deportation order is not in accordance with the law.  The  appellant's
      appeal  against  the  refusal  to  revoke  the  deportation  order  is
      therefore allowed but only on  this  ground.  The  withdrawal  of  the
      deportation order and the decision to refuse to revoke the deportation
      order means  that  the  respondent  will  now  need  to  consider  the
      appellant's position in the UK.

Upper Tribunal Judge Gill               Date: 8 March 2016
