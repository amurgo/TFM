Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. These are  the  appellants'  appeals  against  the  decision  of  Judge
    Mosolowski made following a hearing at Taylor  House  on  20th  October
    2017.



Background

 2. The first appellant is the mother of the second appellant and both  are
    nationals of Vietnam.  The first appellant claimed that she was married
    to Mr Ha [D] and the second appellant was his younger  daughter.   They
    both made applications for settlement in the UK to join him in  January
    2016 but were refused on 14th March 2016.  The Entry Clearance  Officer
    was not satisfied that the couple were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship nor that the sponsor was employed as claimed.

 3. The first appellant met the sponsor in 1990 and  their  first  daughter
    was born in 1991.  They  married  on  22nd  August  2000.   The  second
    appellant was born in 2004  but  before  her  birth  the  sponsor  left
    Vietnam for the UK arriving on 31st August 2004.

 4. He eventually obtained indefinite leave  to  remain  in  February  2011
    under the then legacy scheme run by the respondent and became a British
    national in 2012.   The  appellants  thereafter  wished  to  join  him,
    leaving the older daughter in Vietnam, but there was  a  delay  in  the
    applications being made  until  the  first  appellant  had  passed  her
    English language test requirement.

 5. The appellants claimed to have been maintained  by  money  remitted  to
    them from the UK by the sponsor since 201. When he first came  here  he
    was working unofficially as a cleaner, earning just enough for  him  to
    live on, but he was able to remit monies back  to  Vietnam  from  2012.
    Since then he has visited them  four  times  and  keeps  in  touch   by
    telephone.

 6. The appellants' evidence was that the sponsor started working as a chef
    in 2011 working at the same restaurant until January 2016  and  earning
    around �25,000 per annum.  He now works at a  different  restaurant  at
    the same wage.  He provided all of the specified evidence  required  by
    Appendix FM-SE.

 7. The respondent considered that evidence to be  unreliable.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer was aware that  the  payslips  and  P60  forms  could
    easily be reproduced.  He had concerns about the amount of money  being
    transferred  to  Vietnam  which  he  considered  to  be  excessive   in
    comparison with the monies which  the  sponsor  was  actually  earning.
    Accordingly  he  suspected  that  the  sponsor's  earnings   had   been
    exaggerated.

 8. The judge said that there  was  a  major  problem  with  the  sponsor's
    credibility highlighting a discrepancy in the evidence  as  to  whether
    the appellant was  self-sufficient  before  2011  or  whether  she  was
    dependent entirely on remittances.  She said  that  it  was  surprising
    that he earned �25,000 as a kitchen assistant and  did  not  understand
    how he could afford to repay a substantial loan which appeared  in  the
    bank statements.  She was concerned that he was able to afford to spend
    the times in Vietnam visiting his family as claimed.  There was also  a
    question mark about his rent.  In her view the appellant ought to  have
    provided evidence  from  HMRC.   She  placed  little  reliance  on  the
    payslips which she said were in reasonably good  condition  and  had  a
    black toner cartridge mark which  indicated  that  they  had  all  been
    produced in one batch.  She concluded that his general credibility  was
    extremely poor and did not understand why he left  Vietnam  before  the
    birth of his second daughter.

 9. She concluded that the appellants had  not  made  out  their  case  and
    dismissed the appeal.



The Grounds of Application

10. The appellants sought permission to appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    judge had come to adverse findings mainly based  on  assumptions  which
    she had not put to  the  sponsor  and  therefore  deprived  him  of  an
    opportunity of allaying her concerns.  Some would  have  been  answered
    had she asked the  sponsor,  for  example,  in  relation  to  the  rent
    payments which changed when he rented a  larger  flat  which  would  be
    suitable for the appellants. She had also made a  mistake  of  fact  in
    describing him as a kitchen assistant which he was  not.   Furthermore,
    she had failed to consider the evidence  which  was  before  her.   For
    example, she  had  doubted  whether  the  photographs  which  had  been
    produced were of the appellants but she could have compared them to the
    DNA photographs in the bundle and ascertained  for  herself  that  they
    were the same.

11. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge Lambert but granted
    upon re-application by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Pitt  on  18th  September
    2018.



Consideration of Whether There is a Material Error of Law

12. Mr Avery defended the judge's decision and whilst  he  recognised  that
    not every judge would have reached the same conclusion, he argued  that
    she had looked at the evidence in the round and come  to  a  conclusion
    open to her.

13. Mr Kannangare relied on his grounds.  All  of  the  specified  evidence
    required by the Entry Clearance Officer had been provided  dating  from
    2012 including P60s. It argued against any fraud having been  committed
    that he had provided documents going back to 2012 when the  application
    was only made in 2015.   The  sponsor  earned  more  than  the  amounts
    required by the Rules.

14. I am satisfied that the judge did err in law  and  did  not  adequately
    assess the evidence which was before her.

15. The couple have been married for many years and have  two  children.  A
    number of photographs have been produced  and  if  the  judge  had  any
    doubts about whether they were the same person  as  the  appellant  she
    could have compared the photographs with those on the application  form
    or the DNA evidence. Evidence of remittances  was  produced  for  three
    years preceding  the  application.  There  is  no  discrepancy  in  the
    evidence in relation to whether the appellants were being maintained by
    remittances sent by the sponsor.  It has always been  their  case  that
    initially when he was in the UK, before he obtained ILR, he was  unable
    to send money and the first appellant made a living selling  things  in
    the market in Vietnam. However, since the time when he  was  earning  a
    good salary he has been sending substantial remittances.

16. The appellant had provided P60s, letters from  his  employer  and  bank
    statements showing the amounts of his salary being paid into those bank
    accounts.

17. It is not clear to me why the fact that the sponsor  took  out  a  loan
    should go against him nor why the sponsor  would  not  be  entitled  to
    holiday pay having worked for the same employer for  five  years.   The
    question of the rent could easily have been answered if she  had  asked
    the sponsor why he had changed to renting a property at �350 per  month
    from �60 a week. The change was made  in  anticipation  of  the  family
    coming to the UK.

18. The judge appeared to regard his credibility as  being  extremely  poor
    but does not explain why she did so.

19. She erred in law because she deprived the appellants of an  opportunity
    of answering her concerns. Moreover, the decision is against the weight
    of the evidence. It is set aside.



Findings and Conclusions

20. Mr Avery declared that he did not wish to cross-examine the sponsor and
     he simply relied on the original decision.

21. Mr Kannangare provided a printout from HM Revenue & Customs dated  12th
    December 2017 setting out the sponsor's source of income  for  the  tax
    years ending 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  A copy of  that  printout  was
    given to Mr Avery and he made no submissions on it. He made no  attempt
    to argue that the documents could not now be relied upon.

22. First, in relation to the relationship  between  the  sponsor  and  the
    appellants, I note that they have been married for eighteen  years  and
    since the sponsor has gained British citizenship and ILR, he  has  been
    fully supporting them in Vietnam.  He has  also  made  four  visits  to
    them.  He has pursued this appeal for two years.

23. There is no basis upon which I could properly conclude that this is not
    a genuine and subsisting relationship.

24. So far as the finances are concerned the document from HMRC  is  wholly
    consistent with the P60s and the payslips  which  have  been  provided.
    The appellant has provided all of the  documents  required  by  him  in
    accordance with Appendix FM-SE.  They  are  all  consistent  with  each
    other.

The original judge erred in law.  Her decision is set aside.  It  is  remade
