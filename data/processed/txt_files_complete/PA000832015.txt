                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Sreeraman, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Amunwa, instructed by G Singh Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision promulgated 20 October  2015  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow which allowed the respondent's  appeal
    against deportation.  The appeal was  allowed  because  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge found that the appellant's claims for asylum  and  under
    Article 3 of the ECHR were made  out  and  therefore  came  within  the
    exception to automatic deportation in Section 33(2) of the  UK  Borders
    Act 2007.

 2. For the purposes of this appeal, I refer to the Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department as the respondent and  to  SOR  as  the  appellant,
    reflecting their positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the  appellant  from  the  contents  of  his
    protection claim and to his minor child.

 4. The background to this matter is that the appellant came to the  United
    Kingdom in 2005 with a visit visa and remained  unlawfully  thereafter.
    He was convicted of conspiracy to fraud on 22 May  2012  and  made  the
    subject of a 12 month conditional discharge and ï¿½85 costs.  On  1  July
    2013 he was convicted of conspiracy to  defraud  and  sentenced  to  27
    months' imprisonment on 6 September 2013.

 5. Deportation proceedings commenced on 16 October 2013 when the appellant
    was asked to identify why he  should  not  be  deported  and  asked  to
    completer   and   return   Form   ICD.0350.   The   appellant's   legal
    representatives made submissions on his  behalf  concerning  Article  8
    ECHR only in a letter dated 18 December 2013. The appellant based  that
    claim on his British partner and their child, born in 2006. That letter
    also enclosed a completed Form ICD.0350 signed by the appellant  on  15
    November 2013 which referred only to family and private life issues. On
    4 December 2014 a deportation order was made. On 16 September 2014  the
    appellant made an asylum claim on the basis that he was  bisexual.  The
    protection claim was refused on 30 April 2015 and  the  current  appeal
    followed that decision.

 6. The respondent's  written  challenge  referred  to  three  grounds.  Ms
    Sreeraman confirmed that the third ground was merely a summary  of  the
    first two so it goes no further.

 7. I deal with the second ground first which states as follows:
         "2.  Credibility
             (a)  The FTJ  finds,  after  'material  consideration  of  all
                  relevant and material circumstances', that  a  finding  of
                  credibility needs to be made and that examination of those
                  factors that are material is disclosed  in  the  preceding
                  paragraphs (paragraph 19-20).
             (b)  The SSHD  submits  that  the  FTJ  does  not  detail  the
                  material consideration given to the evidence, nor  provide
                  reasons why the A is  deemed  to  be  credible.   The  FTJ
                  refers  to  a  'credible  explanation'  being  given,  but
                  advances no reasons why the  A  is  credible  despite  his
                  fraud offence and the concerns highlighted in  the  SSHD's
                  Reasons for Refusal Letter.
             (c)  The FTJ's failure to engage with the  divergent  opinions
                  at appeal is a material misdirection of law that  affected
                  the decision to allow the appeal on Asylum and  Article  3
                  grounds."

 8. The respondent's Reasons  for  Refusal  letter  dated  30  April  2015,
    referred to in this ground, gives the following reasons for finding the
    appellant's claim to be bisexual to be without  credibility,  beginning
    on page 5:
         "As background it is  a  fact  that  you  have  presented  specific
         details of only one relationship, either in Nigeria or in  the  UK.
         You have stated that you are currently in a civil partnership  with
         [VA], and that you have a daughter together, [TR],  date  of  birth
         [2006], (ASI, section 1).  While you have claimed to have had same-
         sex relationships both in Nigeria  and  in  the  UK  you  have  not
         provided any details of these alleged partners.   In  such  matters
         the burden of proof is on the  applicant  to  establish  the  facts
         concerning these relationships.  You have only been able to provide
         details of one heterosexual relationship.  In the  absence  of  any
         evidence of you having a same-sex relationship, it is not  accepted
         that you have sufficiently demonstrated that you have had  same-sex
         relationships.
         It is also noted that you provided a statement in an appeal against
         the deportation order.  This document is dated  18  December  2013.
         That document has been carefully considered and it is the case that
         you make no mention of any fear of return to Nigeria at  this  time
         as a result of your sexuality.  It is considered that if you had  a
         genuine fear of return to Nigeria, at that time on account of  your
         sexuality, then you would have mentioned it  in  your  reasons  for
         opposing the deportation.  As you failed to do  so  in  your  later
         claim that you would  face  persecution  in  Nigeria  due  to  your
         sexuality is rejected.
         You have also provided evidence in response to on  ICD  0350  form,
         dated 16/10/13.  In this form the details that  you  have  provided
         have been carefully examined.  In this document you  have  provided
         details of your life and problems in Nigeria.   It  is  noted  that
         again you  have  failed  to  provide  any  details  regarding  your
         sexuality.  You have indicated that you were not wanted at home  as
         you say it interfered with your father's lifestyle as a  polygamist
         man, (ICD 0350 form, dated 16/10/13,  page  (sic)).   This  is  not
         consistent with your later claim that your father did not want  you
         around as your sexuality disgusted him, (AIR question 9).  You have
         also indicated that when you came to the UK you were lied  to,  and
         that you were told that it was for a holiday, (ICD 0350 form, dated
         16/10/13,  page  23).   It  is  considered  that  this  account  is
         significantly different from your recent  claim  that  your  father
         decided to send you  to  the  UK  due  to  fears  for  your  safety
         regarding your sexuality, (AIR question 15).  You have been  unable
         to provide a consistent account of central aspects  of  your  claim
         for asylum.  Your claim that you fear return to Nigeria on  account
         of your sexuality is rejected.
         It is generally considered that as a  genuine  asylum  seeker  will
         seek protection at the first available opportunity.  You arrived in
         the UK in July 2005, and  despite  having  an  appeal  against  the
         deportation order (see paragraph 17), you failed to  make  a  claim
         for asylum until 16/09/14.  It is therefore not accepted that  this
         behaviour is consistent with your claim to  have  a  genuine  well-
         founded fear of persecution in Nigeria.
         In conclusion it  is  not  accepted  that  you  are  homosexual  or
         bisexual.  Your claim to have had same-sex partners in  the  UK  is
         rejected."

 9. The respondent therefore  made  a  number  of  points  on  credibility,
    therefore, summarised as:
          a. the appellant was able to provide specific details only of one
             heterosexual relationship
          b. no mention was made of his bisexuality in the  submissions  of
             18 December 2013
          c. no mention was made of his bisexuality in  the  Form  ICD.0350
             dated 15 November 2013
          d. the appellant's evidence in his Form ICD.0350 and his AIR  was
             discrepant as to why he was not wanted in his father's home
          e. the appellant's evidence in his Form ICD.0350 and his AIR  was
             discrepant as to why he came to the UK
          f. he made  his  protection  claim  very  late,  only  after  the
             deportation order was made and after coming to the UK in 2005

10. The First-tier Tribunal deals with credibility at [19] and [20], thus:
         "19. It is necessary to make a finding  of  credibility  concerning
             the evidence of the appellant and his partner.   I  have  made
             such a  finding  only  after  material  consideration  of  all
             relevant and material circumstances.  In making this  finding,
             I have taken into account all the available evidence,  in  the
             round, and have attached such  weight  as  I  consider,  after
             anxious scrutiny, to be properly  attributable  thereto.   The
             reasons  for  our  finding  are  set  out  in  the   following
             examination of factors material to the finding.
         20.  In giving his evidence the  appellant  has  given  a  credible
             explanation  of  his  claim.   He  rationally  explained   his
             personal circumstances.  The core details of  his  claim  have
             been established, notwithstanding the late  emergence  of  his
             claim.   His  explanation  for  the  late  claim,  mindful  of
             sensitivities that exist in gay issues, is understandable  and
             not least of all because of his continuing  relationship  with
             his partner.  It has been established that he is gay.   If  he
             were to be returned to Nigeria, because he is what he is it is
             inevitable  that  he  will  engage   in   gay   relationships,
             notwithstanding his promise to be faithful with  his  partner.
             When last in Nigeria his open conduct resulted  in  homophobic
             attacks.  Should he be returned to Nigeria  it  is  likely  to
             recur."

11. The First-tier Tribunal gives a reason at [20] for not  placing  weight
    on the lateness of the claim, that being the "sensitivities that  exist
    in gay issues". The  reasoning  does  not  address  any  of  the  other
    concerns set out by the respondent in the Reasons for Refusal Letter.

12. Mr Amunwa suggested that the judge must be saying  that  he  found  the
    appellant's evidence, recorded at [14] of the decision, to be  rational
    and "credible". That was a finding open to him on  the  evidence.  That
    conclusion may or may not have been open to the judge but the challenge
    here is adequacy of reasons rather than rationality.  The reference  in
    [19] to an "examination of factors material  to  the  finding"  is  not
    supported by such an examination other than the reference in [20] as to
    little weight being placed on the lateness of the claim.

13. I find that the First-tier Tribunal decision on the credibility of  the
    appellant's protection claim is inadequately reasoned and must  be  set
    aside and re-made.

14. The respondent's other challenge is that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    erred in the approach to the certification of  the  appellant's  asylum
    claim under Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002.  The First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  findings  on  this  point  are
    contained at 12 as follows:
         "12. While the appellant has been convicted of two counts  of  what
             constitute  particularly  serious  crimes,  it  has  not  been
             established that he is 'a danger to the  community'.   I  hold
             that the appellant has adduced satisfactory evidence to  rebut
             the  presumption  so  enacted.   There  is  no  real  risk  of
             repetition.  It is accepted that he has rehabilitated  himself
             and is remorseful for his unlawful conduct."

15. There is nothing more in the decision explaining why it was found  that
    the appellant had rebutted the s.72 presumption  regarding  "danger  to
    the community".  I am unable to ascertain how a conclusion  that  there
    was no risk of repetition of the offence was reached or how  the  judge
    came to accept that the appellant "has rehabilitated himself"  and  "is
    remorseful". It was not suggested, quite rightly,  that  this  was  the
    only conclusion open to the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant being  a
    repeat offender and there being no analysis  of  the  OASys  assessment
    dated 9 October 2013.

16. Again, it is my conclusion that the decision as to certification of the
    asylum claim is inadequately reasoned to the extent that  an  error  of
    law arises and the decision must also be set aside to be remade.

17. As the  appeal  was  allowed  on  protection  grounds,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision did not go  on  to  consider  other  aspects  of  the
    deportation appeal, including the appellant's  Article  8  ECHR  claim.
    There are, therefore, no extant findings  following  my  error  of  law
    decision. This is therefore a case where it is appropriate to remit the
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal in line with the  Senior  President's
    Practice  Direction.   This   was   also   the   view   of   both   the
    representatives.

Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside.  The appeal will be remade by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.
