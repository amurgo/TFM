For the Appellant:           Mrs A Javed, solicitor with Reiss Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mrs R Petterson, Home Office Presenting Officer

     1. The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 applies to Muslim divorces in
        Pakistan (other than the part of  Kashmir  which  is  in  Pakistan)
        (Baig  v Entry Clearance Officer, Islamabad (Pakistan) [2002] UKIAT
        04229);
     2. There is no similar restriction on divorce  in  India,  and  Indian
        Muslim husbands may lawfully divorce their wives by bare talaq,  as
        may Pakistani Muslim husbands in that part of  Kashmir which is  in
        Pakistan;
     3. Such divorces are recognised by the United Kingdom (subject to  the
        rules on domicile and habitual residence therein set out)  pursuant
        to s.46 (2) of the Family Law Act 1986.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is the reconsideration, with permission granted  to  the  appellant,
   of the determination  of  the  Tribunal  (Immigration  Judge  EMM  Smith)
   dismissing his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of  State  to
   refuse the appellant entry  clearance  to  join  his  wife,  Mrs  Rummana
   Dudhwala who is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
   paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).

2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He applied for  entry  clearance
   to join the sponsor in the United  Kingdom.   Both  had  previously  been
   divorced, the appellant in the part of Kashmir which is in  Pakistan  and
   the  sponsor  in  India,  and  both  their  former  spouses  subsequently
   remarried.  Both divorces were by 'bare talaq' and not obtained by  means
   of proceedings as defined in s.46 of the Family Law Act 1986:
      "46 Grounds for recognition

      (1)The validity of an overseas divorce, annulment or legal separation
      obtained by means of proceedings shall be recognised if-
           (a) the divorce, annulment or legal separation is effective
           under the law of the country in which it was obtained; and

           (b) at the relevant date either party to the marriage-

           (i) was habitually resident in the country in which the divorce,
           annulment or legal separation was obtained; or

           (ii) was domiciled in that country; or

           (iii) was a national of that country.

      (2) The validity of an overseas divorce, annulment or legal separation
      obtained otherwise than by means of proceedings shall be recognised if-



           (a) the divorce, annulment or legal separation is effective
           under the law of the country in which it was obtained;

           (b) at the relevant date-

           (i) each party to the marriage was domiciled in that country; or

           (ii)either party to the marriage was domiciled in that country
           and the other party was domiciled in a country under whose law
           the divorce, annulment or legal separation is recognised as
           valid; and

           (c) neither party to the marriage was habitually resident in the
           United Kingdom throughout the period of one year immediately
           preceding that date.


      (3) In this section "the relevant date" means-

           (a) in the case of an overseas divorce, annulment or legal
           separation obtained by means of proceedings, the date of the
           commencement of the proceedings;

           (b) in the case of an overseas divorce, annulment or legal
           separation obtained otherwise than by means of proceedings, the
           date on which it was obtained.

           (4)Where in the case of an overseas annulment, the relevant date
           fell after the death of either party to the marriage, any
           reference in subsection (1) or (2) above to that date shall be
           construed in relation to that party as a reference to the date
           of death.

           (5)For the purpose of this section, a party to a marriage shall
           be treated as domiciled in a country if he was domiciled in that
           country either according to the law of that country in family
           matters or according to the law of the part of the United
           Kingdom in which the question of recognition arises."


3. The parties married in Pakistan  on  12  March  2007  and  the  appellant
   applied for entry clearance to join the sponsor, on 29 May  2007.   On  3
   August 2007, an Entry Clearance Officer refused to grant entry  clearance
   because he was not satisfied that either of the parties was divorced in a
   manner recognised in United Kingdom law, and thus that the  marriage  the
   subject of this application was invalid (paragraph 281 (i) (a)  or  (b)).
   He considered that the appellant, a man with no  qualifications  or  work
   experience, who could not speak, read or write English and  had  made  no
   attempt to research jobs in the United Kingdom, had  not  shown  that  he
   would be able to seek employment in the United Kingdom and to  live  with
   the sponsor without recourse  to  public  funds  (paragraph  281(v)).  He
   further considered that there was no breach of Article 8 ECHR in refusing
   entry clearance.

4. The appellant appealed, unsuccessfully.  The Immigration Judge  dismissed
   both the marriage application (on the basis that  the  sponsor's  divorce
   was not recognised in United Kingdom law) and the Article 8 claim.    The
   Immigration Judge recorded that the sponsor earned over �240 a  week  but
   did  not  consider  it  necessary  to  engage  with   accommodation   and
   maintenance, having found that there was  no  obligation  on  the  United
   Kingdom to recognise the sponsor's divorce and that the parties were not,
   therefore, validly married for the purpose of paragraph 281.

Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 and bare talaq

5. Before the first Immigration Judge,  the  respondent  accepted,  and  the
   Tribunal found, that the appellant's  divorce  was  recognisable  in  the
   United Kingdom because in the part of Kashmir which is in Pakistan, where
   the appellant's divorce took place, compliance  with  the  Muslim  Family
   Laws Ordinance 1961 was not necessary.

6. That exception to the Ordinance is  explained  at  paragraph  13  of  the
   Immigration Appeal Tribunal's starred determination in Baig (the  neutral
   citation for that determination is  now  B  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
   Islamabad (Pakistan) [2002] UKIAT 04229):

      "The Law of Pakistan

      13.   In the previous paragraphs we have set out the  major  forms  of
      divorce in Islamic law and their effect in Islamic law. Pakistan, like
      a  number  of  other  states  with  substantial  Muslim   populations,
      introduced during the second half of the twentieth century legislation
      which had the intention or social purpose of ameliorating some of  the
      provisions of  Islamic  law  as  it  applied  to  its  citizens  (see,
      generally, Norman Anderson, Law Reform in  the  Muslim  World,  London
      1976). Pakistan enacted the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance in  1961.  By
      Section 2, the Ordinance extends to "the whole of Pakistan and applies
      to all Muslim citizens  of  Pakistan,  wherever  they  may  be".  That
      expression of validity needs to be read subject to two considerations.
      The first is that, because of its date, the Ordinance applies also  in
      Bangladesh. The second is that it appears  to  be  generally  accepted
      that the provisions of the Ordinance have no effect  in  the  part  of
      Kashmir which is in Pakistan (sometimes called "Azad Kashmir", that is
      "Free Kashmir", by those who  hold  certain  views  about  its  proper
      governance). Neither of those factors, however, are  germane  to  this
      appeal, for the Appellant is a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  and  not  from
      Kashmir. "

   In contrast to the situation in Baig, the present appellant is  from  the
   part of Kashmir which is in Pakistan.  The Presenting Officer accepted at
   the original hearing that he was validly divorced and free to  marry  the
   sponsor, according to the divorce laws  as  they  apply  in  Kashmir  (in
   Pakistan).  That must be right: if there is no requirement to comply with
   the Ordinance, then a properly evidenced bare talaq (such as that of this
   appellant) is sufficient to meet the provisions of s.46.

7. The appeal failed because the evidence before  the  Tribunal  as  to  the
   sponsor's divorce did not satisfy the Immigration Judge that the  sponsor
   was also divorced in a manner recognised by the United Kingdom.

8. The question therefore is whether the bare talaq pronounced in  India  is
   recognised in United Kingdom law.  Baig cannot help with that:  it  is  a
   case on the Pakistani  law  of  divorce.   The  language  of  s.46(2)  is
   mandatory ('the validity of an overseas divorce... shall be  recognised')
   subject to three conditions, set out in paragraph 46(2)(b):

           " 46(2) (b) [That] at the relevant date-

           (i) each party to the marriage was domiciled in that country; or

           (ii)either party to the marriage was domiciled in that country
           and the other party was domiciled in a country under whose law
           the divorce, annulment or legal separation is recognised as
           valid; and

           (c) neither party to the marriage was habitually resident in the
           United Kingdom throughout the period of one year immediately
           preceding that date."


9. The sponsor is an Indian citizen, as was her first husband.  She  is  now
   present and settled in the United Kingdom,  having  come  to  the  United
   Kingdom after her divorce, pursuant to a right of abode derived from  her
   father and it may be that her present status caused some confusion in the
   mind of the appellant's former representatives  and  the  Tribunal.   Her
   present status is not relevant to the recognition of her  divorce,  since
   it is quite clear that at the date of the divorce she  was  domiciled  in
   India, as was her spouse.    The sponsor still has  an  Indian  passport.



10. The sponsor was therefore not habitually resident in the United  Kingdom
   in the year preceding her divorce and the recognition of that divorce  is
   mandatory, provided that it is  a  valid  divorce  in  Indian  law.   The
   sponsor's first husband has remarried, as has the appellant's first wife.



The validity of a bare talaq in Indian family law

11. The Tribunal had some assistance on this point, albeit not in  the  form
   of an expert report as was originally anticipated.  The  expert  evidence
   was simply too expensive for the appellant to afford it.  We have however
   received the following documents filed by the appellant's representative:

        a) an excerpt from the previous edition of Macdonald's  Immigration
           Law and Practice;
        b) A note entitled 'Divorce in India' by Seth  Associates  (undated
           but available unchanged on the website today);
        c) An excerpt from 'Family law and the  immigrant  communities'  by
           Prof Stephen Cretney (undated);
        d) A BBC news report of 'India Muslim divorce code set out' [2  May
           2005];
        e) An article from the website, 'Women living  under  Muslim  laws'
           (http://www.wluml.org/english/index.shtml) entitled 'Dossier 19:
            Muslim Women and 'Islamic Divorce' in  England',  (undated  but
           available    unchanged    on    the     website     today     at
           http://www.wluml.org/english/pubsfulltxt.shtml?cmd%5B87%5D=i-87-
           2684); and
        f) Cornell University Noel Coulson Memorial Lecture [1995] on  'The
           application of Islamic law in the English courts' by Judge David
           Pearl.



(a)   Macdonald's Immigration law and practice

12. The appellant relied on the previous edition of Macdonald's, but the up-
   to-date passage is at Chapter 11.37-11.40.  Paragraph 11.37  of  that  is
   the most relevant to these proceedings:

      "11.37      The rules relating to recognition of foreign divorces  and
      judicial separations are now to be found in sections 44 to 54  of  the
      Family Law Act 19861 and are not set  out  comprehensively  here.  The
      recognition of Islamic talaq divorces is an issue which usually arises
      in the immigration context when considering whether  the  parties  are
      married and a claimant can enter the UK as  a  spouse.  Under  Islamic
      Shari'a law, a husband is permitted to divorce a wife without recourse
      to court proceedings simply by declaring unequivocally  his  intention
      to repudiate the marriage in the presence of witnesses. This is a bare
      talaq and involves no proceedings at all. Most Islamic countries  have
      modified  religious  law   by   requiring   some   additional   formal
      registration of the talaq with a court or administrative  body  and/or
      that the parties undertake conciliation proceedings. Thus in  Pakistan
      the Muslim Family Law Ordinance requires  registration  of  the  talaq
      with the Chairman of the Union District Council, and  the  talaq  does
      not become effective until the elapse of a period for reconciliation.2
      A failure to comply with these formalities renders the husband  liable
      to a penalty.3  In  Azad  Kashmir,  however,  the  Muslim  Family  Law
      Ordinance does not apply.4

      1     In force 4 April 1988. If a divorce fails to be recognised under
      the provisions of the 1986 Act, s 52(4) and (5)  of  that  Act  allows
      'stepping back'  to  the  previous  legislation,  the  Recognition  of
      Divorce and Legal Separations Act 1971  (in  force  1  January  1972),
      including amendments to that  Act  by  the  Domicile  and  Matrimonial
      Proceedings Act 1973 (the amendments commenced on 1 January 1974). See
      IDI, Ch 8, Annex B on the recognition of marriage and divorce.

      2     Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961. See  discussion  of  Pakistani
      talaq requirements in Baig v Entry Clearance Officer, Islamabad [2003]
      INLR 117, aka B v Entry Clearance Officer, Islamabad (Pakistan) [2002]
      UKIAT 04229 (13 September 2002) (starred).

      3     It may be that  a  divorce  that  fails  to  comply  with  these
      provisions is still a valid divorce recognised in  Pakistan,  and  may
      therefore be recognised in the UK under the Immigration Rules where no
      proceedings have taken place; see below.

      4     See Bi (Maqsood) (10144),  and  see  below.  The  jurisdictional
      limits of Pakistan's legal jurisprudence were confirmed in Khan (Sakhi
      Daler) v The State of Pakistan PLD 1957 Lahore 813  and  in  the  Azad
      Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act 1974. "

13. Note 4 supports the findings as to Azad Kashmir already  set  out.   The
   succeeding  paragraphs  deal  with  marriages  where  one  party  is  not
   domiciled or habitually resident in the country where a bare talaq  takes
   place, which is not the situation here.   The question of the validity of
   the Indian divorce in Indian law is crucial.

14. Seth Associates describe themselves as an internationally networked  law
   firm.  Their note is not dated:  however, it still appears  in  the  same
   form on the internet today:

      "DIVORCE IN INDIA

      The Law

      All major religions have their own laws which govern  divorces  within
      their own community, and separate regulations exist regarding  divorce
      in interfaith marriages.

      Hindus, including Buddhists, Sikhs and  Jains,  are  governed  by  the
      Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; Christians by the Indian Divorce Act,  1869;
      Parsis by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936; and Muslims by the
      Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, which provides the  grounds
      on which women can obtain a divorce, and  the  uncodified  civil  law.
      Civil  marriages  and  inter-community  marriages  and  divorces   are
      governed by the Special Marriage Act, 1956 .Other  community  specific
      legislation includes the Native Converts'  Marriage  Dissolution  Act,
      1866 that allows a Hindu to appeal for a divorce if a spouse  converts
      to Christianity.

      ...Divorce under Muslim law

      Muslims are governed by their personal laws under which "Nikah"  (i.e.
      marriage) is a contract and may be permanent or temporary and  permits
      a man 4 wives if he treats all  of  them  equally.  To  have  a  valid
      "Nikah" under the Muslim Law, presence  of  a  Qazi  (Priest)  is  not
      necessary. Merely a proposal in the presence and hearing of  two  sane
      males or one sane male and two sane female  adults,  all  Muslims  and
      acceptance of the said proposals at the same time constitute  a  valid
      Nikah under the Muslim Personal Law. A husband can  divorce  his  wife
      without any reasons merely by pronouncing  thrice  the  word  "Talak".
      However for a Muslim woman to obtain divorce  certain  conditions  are
      necessary."

(c)   'Family Law and the Immigrant Communities' by Prof. Stephen Cretney

15. The excerpt from this booklet bears no date.  The  relevant  passage  is
   at paragraph 6.2:

      "6.2...The [Muslim Family Laws] Ordinance has  not  been  extended  to
      Kashmir, and although the procedures under the Ordinance appear to  be
      followed in that  territory,  the  English  Court  has  following  the
      position put to it that  it  is  not  necessary  to  comply  with  the
      provisions of the Ordinance in Kashmir (Chaudhary v  Chaudhary  [1985]
      FLR 476).  There has been no legislation in India regarding the  right
      of    the     Muslim     husband     to     divorce     his     wife."
            [Emphasis added]

(d)     BBC News report: 'India Muslim divorce code set out' [2 May 2005]

16. A BBC news report of 2 May 2005 notes that a new marriage code had  been
   issued by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, an authoritative  body
   of Muslim clerics in India. Muslim women activists were  disappointed  by
   the code, which whilst it recommended mediation, laying down that divorce
   and marital discord was no longer a matter  for  the  civil  courts,  was
   silent on the minimum marriage age for Muslim women and stopped short  of
   banning  the  bare  talaq  procedure.   The  campaigners   were   seeking
   legislation on these matters.  The report notes  that  under  the  Indian
   constitution, Muslims had the right to separate laws in matters  such  as
   marriage, divorce and inheritance.  Hindu nationalists were unhappy about
   that aspect of the Constitution and were pushing for a uniform civil code
   for all Indian nationals.

(e) 'Dossier 19:  Muslim Women and 'Islamic Divorce' in England' from  Women
Living under Muslim Laws (www.wluml.org)

17. This article notes that:

      "While  a  Pakistani  talaq  fulfils  the  statutory  requirement   of
      "judicial or other proceedings," a 'bare' or 'classical' talaq  (e.g.,
      an Indian talaq) does not under Pakistani  law,  induced  the  English
      Courts to conclude  that  a  Pakistani  talaq  constituted  a  divorce
      "obtained by means of . . . other proceedings" in the context  of  the
      Recognition of Foreign Divorces and Legal Separations Act, 1971"

(f)   Cornell University Noel Coulson Memorial  Lecture:   'The  application
of Islamic Law in the English Courts' [1995] Judge David Pearl

18. Judge  David  Pearl,  a  former  President  of  the  Immigration  Appeal
   Tribunal said this in his Cornell University lecture in 1995:

      "Probably the most frequent problem to occupy the courts and tribunals
      in this area concerns the question of the validity of the talaq in the
      context of Pakistan or Bangladesh law. Those two  countries,  although
      neither in India nor  Pakistan  Kashmir,  an  Ordinance  of  1961  has
      introduced certain procedural reforms  to  the  traditional  forms  of
      talaq, the most important being the requirement that  notification  of
      the pronouncement of the talaq must be delivered to the Chairman of  a
      local administrative unit known as the Union Council.  It is important
      to observe that  there  are  now  cases  in  Pakistan  which  tend  to
      undermine the framework of the Ordinance. If this turns out to be  the
      basis  for  the  law  in  Pakistan  in  the  future,  the   procedural
      requirements available under  the  Ordinance  will  no  longer  be  of
      relevance.

      At the present time, however, English Courts and Tribunals do  draw  a
      distinction between the Pakistan and Bangladesh talaq which they refer
      to as a "procedural" talaq and the classical  form  of  talaq  (as  in
      India) which they often  call  a  "bare"  talaq.  The  distinction  is
      important because Part II  of  the  Family  Law  Act  1986  draws  the
      distinction, developed by case law,  between  a  divorce  obtained  by
      "judicial or other proceedings" (including  the  procedural  talaq  of
      Pakistan and Bangladesh) and the divorce obtained "otherwise  than  by
      means of proceedings" (for example the talaq pronounced in India or in
      Pakistani Kashmir).  So far as the former is concerned, the  talaq  is
      recognised in UK if it is effective by the law of the country  in  the
      place where it was obtained and, at the relevant  date,  either  party
      was habitually resident, domiciled either in accordance with the local
      law or English  law,  or  a  national  of  that  foreign  country.  In
      contrast, and for rather ill-formed public policy  reasons,  a  "bare"
      talaq will only be recognised in UK if it is effective by the  law  of
      the country where it was obtained and if, at the relevant  date,  each
      party was domiciled in that country (or if only one was  domiciled  in
      that country, then the other was domiciled in  another  country  where
      the bare talaq was recognised). Furthermore, there is an important and
      restrictive proviso to the recognition of the "bare" talaq in the  UK;
      namely no recognition will be entertained if one of  the  parties  has
      been habitually resident in the UK throughout the period of  one  year
      immediately preceding the pronouncement."

19. The consensus which emerges very clearly from these  materials  is  that
   bare talaq is the norm for Muslim divorces in India  and,  provided  that
   both parties were domiciled in India (as here) or one  was  domiciled  in
   India and the other in a country which recognised  bare  talaq  divorces,
   and that neither was habitually resident in the  United  Kingdom  in  the
   year preceding the divorce, recognition of such a divorce is mandatory in
   United Kingdom law.

Validity of the sponsor's divorce

20. The parties to the sponsor's first marriage were both Indian  nationals.
    They are both Muslim, followers of Sir Md  Johar  Mohammed  Burhanuddin,
   who witnessed the pronunciation of the triple talaq on 20  May  2004  and
   prepared the document recording it  which  appears  in  the  bundle.  The
   parties to the marriage were both present in Sagwar, Rajasthan  when  the
   talaq was pronounced (although the sponsor was in a side room  where  she
   could not be seen). There were other male witnesses, two of  whom  signed
   the divorce form. The witnesses, and the sponsor,  also  signed  a  clean
   break form giving custody of the two children  of  the  marriage  to  the
   husband, and making it clear that both of the children  were  allowed  to
   visit their mother.

21. On those facts, Ms Petterson accepted that the sponsor's Indian  divorce
   was valid both in Indian and United Kingdom law.  She was therefore  free
   to remarry the appellant.  The sponsor and appellant married three  years
   after the sponsor's divorce and were both legally free to do so, both  in
   Pakistani,  Indian,  and  United  Kingdom  law,  at  that   time.     The
   Immigration Judge's determination erred in law in that respect  and  that
   finding was material to the outcome  of  the  appeal;  her  determination
   makes it clear that the point was determinative.  Had she been  satisfied
   that the parties were free to marry, the  Immigration  Judge  would  have
   proceeded to consider maintenance and accommodation under rule 281(v) and
   would have reached the opposite conclusion.

Maintenance and accommodation

22. The  Immigration  Judge  did  not  proceed  to  determine  questions  of
   accommodation and maintenance,  but  Ms  Petterson  acknowledged  at  the
   reconsideration hearing that, at the date of decision, with the sponsor's
   wage of �240 weekly and free accommodation from his brother, the  parties
   could accommodate and maintain  themselves  without  recourse  to  public
   funds, even if the appellant was unable to find work on  arrival  in  the
   United Kingdom.   The relevant income support level for a married  couple
   was then (and  remains)  �90.50,  leaving  �149.50  for  rent  and  other
   expenditure should that be necessary.

23. Further, a  'Certificate  and  Undertaking'  given  by  the  appellant's
   brother stated that his property, where the sponsor then resided,  was  a
   'four  bedroomed  attached  property  with  the  usual  amenities'.   The
   property was owned and occupied by the brother,  his  wife,  their  three
   children, and the sponsor.  A  letter  from  the  appellant's  solicitors
   clarified that the sponsor occupied  a  fully  furnished  room  with  one
   double bed, electrical equipment and  other  normal  furniture.   Another
   room was used by the appellant's brother and his wife,  the  third  (with
   two double beds) was occupied by the brother's minor  children,  and  the
   fourth bedroom was unused and reserved  for  guests.   It  contained  two
   double beds.  There was clearly ample room for the appellant to join  the
   sponsor in his brother's home.

24. The appellant's brother states that:

      "In the event that [the appellant]  is  granted  leave  to  enter  the
      United Kingdom the United Kingdom for  this  purpose  I  undertake  to
      provide my brother and sister-in-law rent  free  accommodation  in  my
      property for indefinite period of time."

25. I am satisfied that the maintenance and accommodation requirements  were
   met at the date of decision and that there has been no  change  in  those
   arrangements.   It follows that the outcome of the appeal is wrong and  I
   must substitute a decision allowing it.

Conclusion

26. The Tribunal has decided  that  the  Immigration  Judge's  determination
   contains a material error of law (in her assessment of  the  validity  of
   the Indian talaq divorce) and substitutes a  determination  allowing  the
   appeal under paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules.

DECISION

The original Tribunal made a material error of law.  The following decision
is substituted.  The appeal is allowed.
