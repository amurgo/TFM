For the Appellant:           Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Katani,  Katani & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent (WJH) is a national of the People's  Republic  of  China
    born in 1988.  On the 22nd August 2018 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Raikes) allowed his  appeal,  on  human  rights  grounds,  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision to deport him. The Secretary of State now
    has permission to appeal against that decision.


 2. In broad summary  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  appeal  with
    reference to Article 8, having accepted that it would be 'unduly harsh'
    to expect WJH's seven year old son to go to live with  his  parents  in
    China: it had already been accepted by the Secretary of State  that  it
    would be unduly harsh to expect him to remain here without his  father.
    That finding was made on the basis that the child is  on  the  autistic
    spectrum and there is not in China adequate provision for his needs.


 3. The Secretary of State appeals against that decision  on  two  grounds.
    The second of these need not concern  me  since  it  was  withdrawn  at
    hearing by Mr Bates, the grounds having been overtaken by the  decision
    of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 53 (IAC): the  Secretary  of  State's  complaint
    that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to weigh  in  the  balance  the
    nature of WJH's offending was no longer relevant.

 4. The remaining submissions are set out at paragraphs 3-7 of the  written
    grounds, and concern the First-tier Tribunal's finding that it would be
    unduly harsh to expect an autistic  qualifying  child  to  relocate  to
    China.   These grounds are, with respect, somewhat difficult to follow.
    Paragraphs 3 & 4 simply summarise  parts  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision. Paragraph 6 suggests that the First-tier Tribunal should have
    asked  itself  whether  the  child's  future   development   would   be
    "irreparably harmed" by removal to China, a rather startling  inflation
    of the actual test in the rule. Paragraph 7  appears  to  amount  to  a
    disagreement with the First-tier Tribunal's findings. I am left,  then,
    with paragraph 5:

         "It is also of note that there is no reference in the determination
         to any medical evidence beyond acceptance that the child is on  the
         autism pathway and certainly no indication that the eldest child is
         disabled and in no way satisfies the demanding threshold  of  being
         unduly harsh if returned to China".


    Before me Mr Bates adopted this ground and submitted that the Secretary
    of State's real complaint about this  determination  was  the  lack  of
    reasoning or explanation for the findings made. I have read the written
    ground set out above to omit the double negative in the final  part  of
    the sentence.


 5. What then were the  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings  on  the  autistic
    child?


 6. He was born in the United Kingdom to Chinese parents who  were  without
    leave, and has remained here  ever  since  [�10].  He  is  therefore  a
    'qualifying child' who has only ever known the United  Kingdom  as  his
    home [�30 & 32]. Mr WJH enjoys a subsisting parental relationship  with
    his son [�25].   The child is happy and settled at school and is making
    progress [�30]. The   Secretary of State accepts that  separation  from
    his father would have a significant impact upon him and his ability  to
    manage on a daily basis [�30]. The child  has  significant  health  and
    development needs that are currently being  investigated,  and  he  has
    been placed on the 'autism pathway' [�32]. Although  the  Secretary  of
    State has asserted that there are facilities for children  with  autism
    in China it is unclear whether this is  conclusively  the  case  [�32].
    Whilst there is some evidence of research and treatment taking place in
    China it "appears that it is at best piecemeal"  [�32].   WJH  produced
    evidence stating that such support that there is available in China  is
    only for children up to the age of six and  there  is  no  support  for
    adults [�33].  He would  therefore  face  serious  difficulties  [�33].
    The family may be subject to penalty for breaching the family  planning
    scheme and the financial and  social  consequences  of  this  could  be
    significant [�34]. There is a risk that the ability of  the  family  to
    access services such as education would be extremely limited [�34].

 7. The Tribunal reaches its global conclusion at �37:

         "I find therefore that whilst it may not be  considered  inherently
         unduly harsh to expect a child who is a qualifying child  to  leave
         the United Kingdom, the impact of removing  the  eldest  child  and
         indeed his siblings in  these  particular  circumstances  could  be
         viewed as such. I am satisfied that the evidence indicates that  he
         is fully socially and culturally integrated into the United Kingdom
         and  whilst  experiencing  difficulties  at  present  and  awaiting
         further assessment has progressed well in his education at  school.
         If he were to be removed with the Appellant, it would  in  my  view
         not only cause significant disruption to his development now and at
         this stage in his life, but in the future".

 8. I turn then to the Secretary of State's surviving ground.  I  disregard
    the point made about the lack of medical evidence to  demonstrate  that
    the child is 'disabled'.  There is  no  requirement  that  a  child  be
    'disabled' before the test could be satisfied.  The  question  for  the
    Tribunal was whether there was before it evidence to  demonstrate  that
    it would be 'unduly harsh' to expect this child to  relocate  to  China
    with his family.


 9. Mr Bates submits that if this was  the  case,  the  Tribunal  fails  to
    articulate what it might have been. There  is  no  explanation  in  the
    determination as where on the autism spectrum this child fell.  Without
    that it was impossible to say how the lack of educational opportunities
    in China, or the lack of provision for autism, might affect  him.    In
    short, it was not possible to simply  draw  a  line  between  the  word
    'autism' and  a  conclusion  that  removal  would  be  'unduly  harsh'.
    Whether that was the outcome depended not just on the circumstances  in
    China, but upon how severely the child was affected by his condition.

10. Mr Katani points out that the Secretary of State  has  taken  no  issue
    with the child's diagnosis, and that none of  the  findings  about  his
    life  here  have  been  challenged.   The   evidence   cited   in   the
    determination, and included in the bundle, was that beyond the age of 6
    - which this child is - there is no care for autism in China. In  those
    circumstances it was plainly open to the  Tribunal  to  find  that  his
    removal would be unduly harsh.

11. I am satisfied that the Secretary of State has made out his  ground  of
    appeal.

12. Many of the individual findings made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  were
    perfectly reasonable. I cannot  think,  for  instance,  that  there  is
    anything wrong in fact or law with  its  conclusion  that  an  autistic
    child who is happy and settled in a certain school  will  be  adversely
    affected by an  enforced  move.    I  am  however  satisfied  that  the
    Secretary of State is entitled to complain that  he  cannot  understand
    the basis of this decision overall. The Tribunal  has  found  that  the
    child will face "serious disruption" if moved to China  [at  �37],  and
    that the difficulties he is likely to encounter would be  "significant"
    [at �33], but the determination contains no analysis  of  whether  such
    disruption  or  difficulties  could  be   described   as   "bleak"   or
    "excessively" harsh.   As KO  (Nigeria)  underlines,  this  is  a  high
    threshold test: 'significant difficulties' is not the  same  as  'undue
    harshness'. The determination finds that there is  a  "risk"  that  the
    child would  have  "extremely  limited"  access  to  education  without
    setting out an actual finding on the extent of that risk, or  what  the
    consequences of that might be [at �34]. For those reasons I  find  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside for a lack of
    reasoned findings.

    Anonymity

13. WJH is a foreign criminal and as such would not ordinarily benefit from
    an order protecting his identity.  The  appeal  however  turns  on  the
    presence in the United Kingdom of his child. Having had regard to  Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I  am
    concerned that identification of the WJH may lead to identification  of
    his child and I therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in
    the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Respondent is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Decisions


14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law
    and it is set aside.


15. Due to the extent of fact-finding required I am satisfied that the most
    appropriate forum  for  disposal  of  this  appeal  is  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. I remit the matter de novo  for  remaking  before  any  judge
    other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Raikes.

16. There is an order for anonymity.
