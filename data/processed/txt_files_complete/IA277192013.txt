                        MR HAJI ABUUBAKAR HAJI YAKUBU
                                                                  Respondent



    Representation:
                            For the Appellant:     Ms P Hastings a
           Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            For the Respondent:    Mr G Davison of
           counsel instructed by AJA Solicitors


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL


   1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department ("the
      Secretary of State"). The respondent is a citizen of Tanzania who was
      born on 26 April 1982 ("the claimant).


   2. The claimant arrived in  the  UK  on  21  November  2003  with  entry
      clearance as a student. He received subsequent extensions of leave to
      remain as a student for periods the last of which ended on 31 October
      2009. Before that expired he made an application for leave to  remain
      under the Tier 1  Post  Study  Work  category.  The  application  was
      granted and he was given leave expiring on 3 June 2013.  Before  that
      leave expired he made an in time application  for  further  leave  to
      remain under the same category. On 19  June  2013  the  Secretary  of
      State refused the application and also decided to give directions for
      his removal from the UK.


   3. The claimant was awarded all  the  required  points  for  Attributes,
      Qualifications, UK Experience,  English  Language  qualification  and
      Maintenance Funds but only 5 rather than the necessary 20 points  for
      Previous Earnings. The  claimant  stated  that  he  had  earnings  of
      �36,313.16 and an income of �7,200 from self-employment. It  was  not
      accepted that the documents submitted established this or showed that
      the required National Insurance contributions had been paid.


   4. The claimant appealed and First-Tier Tribunal  Judge  Devittie  ("the
      FTTJ") heard his appeal on 31 January 2014. He allowed the claimant's
      appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds. The Secretary of State  was
      granted permission to appeal against that decision. Her  appeal  came
      before me on 7 May 2014. In a Decision and  Directions  dated  8  May
      2014 I found that the FTTJ had erred in  law  and  I  set  aside  his
      decision directing that it should  be  reheard  on  Article  8  human
      rights grounds. I preserved the FTTJ's findings  of  credibility  and
      fact.


   5. At that hearing Mr Davison indicated that the claimant might make  an
      application for leave to amend  the  initial  grounds  of  appeal  to
      include a claim for leave to remain based  on  10  years'  continuous
      residence. I directed that if, prior to the hearing, the Secretary of
      State  and  those  representing  the  claimant  were  able  to  reach
      agreement about this application then the Tribunal should be informed
      and the matter brought to my attention so that I could  give  further
      directions.


   6. Today Ms Hastings informed us that she had agreed with Mr Davison for
      the claimant that the Secretary of State would withdraw her  decision
      of  19  June  2013  so  that  the  10  years'  continuous   residence
      application could be considered. If the application was granted  then
      the claimant would be entitled to 2 years' further  leave  to  remain
      rather than indefinite leave  to  remain  although  he  might  obtain
      indefinite leave at some later stage. Mr Davison confirmed that  this
      course of action was agreed and supported the application.


   7. We consent to the Secretary of State withdrawing the decision  of  19
      June 2013 which amounts to a withdrawal of her case under rule 17 (1)
      (a) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. The appeal
      is also treated as withdrawn in the First-Tier Tribunal under rule 17
      (2) of The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005. We
      record  that  the  effect  of  this  is  that  the  claimant  has  an
      outstanding application before the Secretary of State which we  agree
      has been varied to encompass a 10 years'  continuous  long  residence
      claim under paragraphs 276B,  276A1  and  276A2  of  the  Immigration
      Rules. This Notice of Withdrawal should be given to the parties.
