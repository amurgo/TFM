For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by a citizen of Pakistan against the  decision  of
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones  QC  dismissing  his  appeal
       against a decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  him  a
       residence card pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 on
       the basis of his marriage to an EEA national, in this case a citizen
       of Spain.

    2. The Judge recognised, correctly, that it was for  the  Secretary  of
       State to prove that the marriage is a marriage of convenience.   The
       judge found that burden had been discharged.  In short, he found the
       appellant to be dishonest and the  timing  of  his  application  set
       against the rest  of  his  immigration  history  to  be  revealingly
       cynical.

    3. I begin by considering very carefully the decision of the First-tier
       Tribunal Judge. There is no doubt that the decision could have  been
       written with more grace but it does not follow from  that  criticism
       that it is wrong in law.

    4. He dealt with the immigration history.  He noted  that  on  11  July
       2016 the appellant applied for a residence card on the basis of  his
       marriage to a Spanish national.  The appellant was born in 1990  and
       his wife  in  1988.   The  appellant's  wife  originally  came  from
       Morocco.  He is from Pakistan.  They are both generally  thought  of
       as countries where much of the population follows Islam.

    5. The judge noted that it was the appellant's case  that  he  met  his
       wife "on Facebook" in March 2015 and in  person  in  November  2015.
       They decided to marry on 31 December 2015 and there  was  a  wedding
       ceremony on 22 June 2016.

    6. The appellant said that his wife was in full-time employment earning
       ï¿½1,248 gross.

    7. The judge then acknowledged a decision of Immigration Judge Greasley
       promulgated on  7  March  2017  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
       against a decision to refuse him asylum.

    8. The Judge then resumed his consideration of  the  whole  immigration
       history.  The appellant applied for a student visa in May 2010.   It
       was refused in June 2010.  There was a further application  in  July
       2010.  It was granted and he had leave to remain as a student  until
       21 February 2012.  That leave  was  extended  following  an  in-time
       application until June 2013.  Leave was extended again until October
       2016 but curtailed in July  2014  because  the  appellant's  sponsor
       informed the Home Office that he had stopped attending classes.

    9. The judge noted with disapproval that although the appellant's leave
       to remain had been curtailed he continued  to  live  in  the  United
       Kingdom without permission.

   10. According to the judge the appellant "again  surfaced"  and  applied
       for an EEA residence card in September 2015.  The use of the  phrase
       "again surfaced" is irritatingly casual but  is  not  unlawful.   At
       that time the appellant applied for an EEA  residence  card  on  the
       basis of his intended or actual marriage to someone called  "Wanda".
       However, the application made in September  2015  was  withdrawn  in
       November 2015, and, in December 2015 there was a  fresh  application
       for an EEA residence card on the basis of being the primary carer of
       a British citizen.  The application was refused  in  February  2016,
       and in March 2016 he applied for an EEA residence card on the  basis
       of marriage.  The application was refused on 25 April 2016.  He  was
       arrested, removal directions were set for 26 April 2016, and on  the
       day of removal he claimed asylum.

   11. The judge found the decision of Immigration  Judge  Greasley  showed
       that the appellant was dishonest in his asylum claim and  the  judge
       found this  illuminated  his  subsequent  conduct.   The  judge  did
       consider the overall evidence of the appellant  and  his  wife.   He
       found the evidence to  be  brisk  and  uninformative.   It  was  the
       appellant's  case  that  his  relationship  with  his  current  wife
       "developed very quickly".

   12. In his oral evidence he said that he met his wife when  she  arrived
       from Madrid  in  November  2015.   They  resumed  cohabitation  very
       shortly after arrival (I think on the day of arrival) and she got  a
       job.

   13. However, he said he did not know if his wife had worked in Madrid.

   14. The judge clearly thought that the appellant's  pervious  persistent
       and unsuccessful applications for leave to remain,  and  often  made
       later than they need have been if the appellant  was  serious  about
       securing permission to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  indicated  a
       determination to remain in the United Kingdom rather than to  engage
       responsibly  with  the  requirements  of  immigration  control.   He
       clearly found nothing that suggested any tenderness or affection  by
       the appellant towards his wife and he concluded  that  certainly  at
       its outset the relationship was all  about  him  and  his  having  a
       convenient wife.

   15. Permission was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Smith  who  was
       concerned that the reasons given  were  not  adequate.   As  I  have
       already indicated the tone is depressing but the content  is  there.
       The judge found it was a marriage of convenience and the reasons are
       given.  The timing was cynical, the  relationship  very  short-lived
       before it was relied on for the purposes of marriage.  The appellant
       was a dishonest person.  When these findings were put  together  the
       judge's conclusion that was open to him.

   16. It is claimed that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  failed  to  engage
       with the grounds.  The grounds are set out in the grounds of  appeal
       to the Upper Tribunal.  It is not clear to me if it is  a  criticism
       or just an observation that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  gave  no
       weight to the assertion that the  respondent  following  a  marriage
       interview thought the relationship was a  marriage  of  convenience.
       The judge's point is nobody bothered to show him the record  of  the
       interview. The judge's conclusion was based on the chronology.   The
       grounds also complain  that  the  judge  did  not  engage  with  the
       assertion that the respondent had not  proved  his  case.   That  is
       unsustainable.  The judge recognised the burden of proof  and  found
       that it was satisfied.

   17. Reference is also made to the decision in  Sadovska  v  SSHD  [2017]
       UKSC 54 but the judge was clearly aware that he was  looking  for  a
       predominant rather than sole purpose.  There is no error  there.   I
       also note the judge is criticised for not going through  the  bundle
       with more care.  The judge's point  is  sound  and  it  is  for  the
       appellant who produces a bundle to say why it is  relevant  and  not
       for the judge to read it in the hope that something would  turn  up.
       Nevertheless, it might have been more sensible if the judge had read
       it and looked for points that illuminated the case.  The  bundle  is
       not enormous.

   18. The point is that the bundle gives some slight evidence of affection
       between the appellant and is wife and that they spent some together.
        None of that is in dispute or particularly weighty.  It  cannot  be
       said  that  the  judge  ignored  these  points.    They   were   not
       specifically relied on and did not undermine  his  primary  findings
       which  arises  from  the  chronology   and   the   appellant   being
       disbelieved.

   19. The grounds say  that  certain  points  are  particularly  relevant.
       Pages C8 to C11 (inasmuch as I can find them because the  pagination
       appears to have been cut off by the photocopier) show some  evidence
       of "chitchat" during cohabitation.  Page C6 might require a bit more
       comment.  It is dated 14 April 2016 and is  from  the  Secretary  of
       State and is headed "Investigation of  proposed  marriage  or  civil
       partnership".   It   is   confirmation   of   compliance   with   an
       investigation.  This shows that the parties have complied  with  the
       investigation and says in clear terms that the  decision  "does  not
       constitute a determination as to the genuineness of the relationship
       on which it is based".  As far as I can see it was considered by the
       judge.  Certainly, there is underlining  in  red  that  I  have  not
       placed there.  Failing to consider it, if that is what happened,  is
       not a material error.  It is expressly said not to  be  evidence  of
       the point the judge had to determine.

   20. Mr Melvin's submissions, in effect, were that  the  judge  had  done
       enough.  On this occasion I find that Mr Melvin is right.   Although
       I do not wish to be thought as giving approval to the style  of  the
       decision which was abrupt, I am satisfied the decision  was  lawful.
       The judge knew what he had to decide and has  given  proper  reasons
       for his decision that follows his having  considered  the  evidence.
       It follows therefore that I dismiss the appeal.
