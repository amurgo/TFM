                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) appeals against a decision  of  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal  Sangha  (the  judge)  promulgated  on  27th
    August 2014.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a male Indian citizen born 14th January 1984 who on 8th
    March 2013 applied for entry clearance as the spouse of Rajnee Kaur who
    is settled in the United Kingdom, and to whom  I  shall  refer  as  the
    Sponsor.

The Refusal

 4. The application was refused on 20th  June  2013.   In  summary  it  was
    contended that false documents had been submitted  in  connection  with
    the application, these being documents  connected  with  the  Sponsor's
    employment with Mahmood Accountancy Taxation (MAT).

 5. The application was also refused because the Respondent did not  accept
    that  the  Claimant  and  Sponsor  have  a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship, and it was  not  accepted  that  they  intended  to  live
    permanently together as spouses.

 6. A further reason for refusal was that  the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM were not satisfied.  The Sponsor claimed to have two  jobs,
    one working for MAT, and the other working for Sainsbury.   Because  it
    was not accepted that the documents submitted in  connection  with  the
    MAT employment were genuine, the earnings from this employment were not
    taken into account, and the Respondent calculated  that  the  Sponsor's
    annual income was �11,256, which was below the �18,600 threshold.   The
    Sponsor did not have sufficient savings to make up the shortfall.

Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 7. In brief summary it was contended that the  reasons  for  refusal  were
    minor in nature, and the Claimant had not been interviewed by the  ECO.
    The Claimant requested an oral hearing so that it could be  established
    that he was entitled to be granted entry clearance.

The First-tier Tribunal Decision

 8. The judge found the evidence of the Sponsor to be largely credible  and
    found that the marriage is genuine and subsisting, and that the parties
    intended to live together permanently as husband and wife.

 9. The judge did not find that the ECO had proved that false documents had
    been submitted.  The judge took into account pay slips  issued  by  MAT
    together  with  HMRC  documentation  and   was   satisfied   that   the
    documentation was genuine.

10. The judge was satisfied that the Sponsor's combined earnings  from  MAT
    and Sainsbury exceeded �18,600 per year, and therefore the  appeal  was
    allowed under the Immigration Rules.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

11. The ECO applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   There
    was no challenge to the findings  that  the  marriage  is  genuine  and
    subsisting, and it was not  contended  that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    rejecting the contention that false documents had been submitted.

12. It was contended that the judge  had  erred  in  failing  to  make  any
    findings in relation to the Sponsor's employment with MAT, in  relation
    to paragraph  2  of  Appendix  FM-SE.   This  paragraph  sets  out  the
    specified evidence that must be submitted, and in relation to  salaried
    employment, this includes pay slips covering a  period  of  six  months
    prior to the date of application for entry clearance, and personal bank
    statements corresponding to the same period as the pay  slips,  showing
    that the salary had been paid into  an  account  in  the  name  of  the
    Sponsor, or the Sponsor and Claimant jointly.

13. It was contended that the judge had failed to make any findings  as  to
    whether bank statements had been submitted, showing  the  payment  into
    the bank account of the  Sponsor's  salary  from  MAT.   The  Sponsor's
    annual gross income was therefore not clear.

Permission to Appeal

14. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Woodcraft who found it arguable that  there  was  insufficient
    evidence before the judge to show that the Sponsor  had  satisfied  the
    requirements of Appendix FM, thus the  Sponsor  could  not  demonstrate
    that her earnings from all sources exceeded the �18,600 threshold.

15. Following the grant of permission there was no response  on  behalf  of
    the Claimant pursuant to rule  24  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008.  Directions were issued that there  should  be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law such that the decision should be set aside

16. The Claimant's solicitors then wrote to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  26th
    January 2015 seeking to withdraw the Claimant's appeal, as he wished to
    pursue a fresh application.  This application was refused by  an  Upper
    Tribunal Judge, who pointed out that the Claimant was not the appellant
    before the Upper Tribunal  and  consequently  could  not  withdraw  the
    appeal.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

17. There was no attendance by  or  on  behalf  of  the  Claimant.   I  was
    satisfied that proper notice of the time, date and place of the hearing
    had been given, and this had been acknowledged by a letter  dated  28th
    May 2015, from the Claimant's solicitors.  This letter acknowledged the
    hearing date, and confirmed that as the Claimant no  longer  wished  to
    proceed with this matter, there would be no attendance.

18. In the circumstances, I decided that it  was  appropriate  and  in  the
    interests of justice to proceed with  the  hearing  in  the  Claimant's
    absence.

Error of Law

19. Mr Smart relied upon  grounds  contained  within  the  application  for
    permission to appeal.

20. I was satisfied that the judge had erred in  law  by  failing  to  make
    findings in relation to paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE.  The  judge  had
    not made any findings as to whether the  Claimant  had  submitted  bank
    statements covering a period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application, showing the Sponsor's income from MAT, being paid  into  a
    bank account.  This  had  been  raised  as  an  issue  in  the  refusal
    decision, and the judge should have made findings  as  to  whether  the
    specified evidence had been submitted.

21. I found that the absence of findings on a material matter, amounted  to
    an error of law such that the decision must be set aside and re-made.

Re-making the Decision

22. The only issue before me related  to  the  evidential  requirements  of
    paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE in relation to the  Sponsor's  employment
    with MAT.  The other findings made  by  the  judge  in  favour  of  the
    Claimant had not been challenged and were therefore preserved.

23. Mr Smart  submitted  that  although  Halifax  Bank  statements  in  the
    Sponsor's name had been submitted, they did not show payments  covering
    a period of six months from MAT.

24. Mr Smart pointed out that the  Sponsor's  evidence  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as set out in paragraph  11  of  the  decision,  was  that  in
    relation to her employment with MAT, she was paid in cash  the  sum  of
    �477.98 per month, and the money was deposited in her bank account on a
    Friday following receipt of the money.

25. Mr Smart pointed out that the pay slips covering a  period  six  months
    prior to the date of application, were  dated  between  30th  September
    2012 and 28th February 2013.  The  bank  statements  only  showed  four
    payments rather than six payments, and the money deposited,  which  was
    in the sum of �477.98, was always deposited on a Friday.   However  the
    date that the money was deposited preceded the date on  the  pay  slip.
    For example �477.98 was deposited on 21st September 2012, although  the
    pay slip  was  dated  30th  September  2012.   In  November  money  was
    deposited on 23rd November 2012, whereas the pay slip  was  dated  30th
    November 2012.  It therefore appeared that the Sponsor  was  depositing
    cash prior to receiving her wages in cash.

26. I was asked to dismiss the Claimant's appeal.

27. I reserved my decision.





My Conclusion and Reasons

28. In remaking the  decision  I  have  taken  into  account  a  bundle  of
    documents submitted on behalf of the ECO,  and  the  Claimant's  bundle
    submitted under cover of a letter from his solicitors dated  19th  June
    2014.  Both these bundles had been before the First-tier Tribunal.

29. In relation to the Immigration Rules I bear in mind that the burden  of
    proof  is  on  the  Claimant  and  the  standard  is   a   balance   of
    probabilities.

30. The only issue that I was asked to decide related  to  paragraph  2  of
    Appendix FM-SE.

31. In relation to her employment with MAT the Sponsor  had  submitted  pay
    slips covering a six month period prior to  the  date  of  application,
    which was 8th March  2013.   The  earliest  pay  slip  was  dated  30th
    September 2012, and the most recent  28th  February  2013.   Pay  slips
    indicated that the  Sponsor  was  paid  �477.98  per  month,  with  the
    exception of October when she took one  month's  holiday  without  pay.
    The Sponsor's employment with MAT was stated to  have  started  on  1st
    September 2012.

32. Paragraph 2(c) of Appendix FM-SE requires that personal bank statements
    corresponding to the same periods as the pay slips must  be  submitted,
    showing that the salary has been paid into the account.

33. The  Sponsor  submitted  Halifax  Bank  statement  in  her  name.   The
    statements covered a  period  between  20th  September  2012  and  20th
    February 2013.

34. The bank statements do show four payments of  �477.98  going  into  the
    account.  Funds went into the account  on  21st  September  2012,  23rd
    November 2013, 21st December 2012, and 18th January 2013.

35. Paragraph 2(c) must be strictly complied with, and I do  not  find  all
    the six months' payments from MAT  have  been  paid  into  the  Halifax
    account.  I accept that the pay slip dated 30th October 2012  indicates
    that the Sponsor was not paid for that  month,  but  the  Halifax  Bank
    statements should still show five payments relating  to  the  Sponsor's
    salary from MAT, and only four payments are shown.  Therefore there has
    not been compliance with paragraph 2(c) and the appeal  cannot  succeed
    as mandatory specified evidence has not been submitted.

36. This is not an appeal where Article 8 was raised in the  appeal  before
    the First-tier Tribunal and there was no  consideration  of  Article  8
    before that Tribunal.  There has been no  indication  by  the  Claimant
    that he wishes Article 8 to be considered by the Upper Tribunal, and on
    the contrary, the Claimant has indicated  that  he  does  not  wish  to
    proceed with  this  appeal,  and  his  solicitors  previously  made  an
    unsuccessful application for the appeal to be withdrawn.   I  therefore
    do not go on to consider Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.





Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The Claimant's appeal is dismissed



Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.
