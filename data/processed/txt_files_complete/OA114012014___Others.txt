Partners
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal issued on 18  September  2015  dismissing  their  appeals
    against the respondent's decision dated  24  November  2014  dismissing
    their  application  for  settlement  as  the   partner   and   children
    respectively of the sponsor.

Background

2.   The appellants are citizens of Sri  Lanka.   The  first  appellant  was
    born on 2 October 1966.  She married the sponsor on 15 May 1995 and the
    legal registration was on 1 June 1995. They have  three  children,  the
    second appellant, born on [ ] 2001, the third appellant,  on  15  March
    1996 and the fourth appellant, on 1 June 1998.   In  2002  the  sponsor
    left Sri Lanka and travelled to the UK where he  claimed  asylum.   His
    application  was  refused  but  eventually  his  leave  to  remain  was
    regularised under the legacy scheme and he became a British citizen  on
    12 November 2013.  The appellants applied  for  entry  clearance  on  6
    March 2014 and in support of the application  they  submitted  evidence
    showing the sponsor's earnings for the year 2012 -  2013  amounting  to
    �14,483.  This is significantly less than the sum  of  �27,200  he  was
    required to show by the provisions of Appendix FM.

3.   When the application was initially  considered  no  decision  was  made
    pending the hearing of the appeal in MM & Ors [2013] EWHC (Admin)  1900
    where Blake J had held that the position of income threshold levels was
    unlawful.  The Secretary of State's appeal was successful, the Court of
    Appeal, at [2014] EWCA Civ 985 upholding the lawfulness of  the  income
    threshold requirement.  By that stage another financial year  had  been
    completed and the appellants were able to produce evidence showing that
    the sponsor's income for the year 2013/2014 had significantly increased
    to �30,000, a sum exceeding the level required in the Rules.

4.   However, the application was refused on 13 August  2014  on  the  basis
    that as at the date of application the appellants were unable  to  show
    that the specified evidence of  the  income  requirements  set  out  in
    Appendix FM-SE were met.  The respondent went on  to  consider  whether
    the application  raised  any  exceptional  circumstances,  which  might
    warrant consideration for a grant of entry clearance outside the  Rules
    but decided that it did not do so.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The appellants appealed against this decision.  The  substance  of  the
    appeal  was  that,  although  the  appellants  could   not   meet   the
    requirements of the Rules at the date of application, they were able to
    do so by  the  date  of  decision.   The  judge  did  not  accept  this
    submission. He held that the requirements of the Rules had to be met at
    the date of application.   When  considering  whether  the  application
    could succeed outside the rules, he said  that  he  bore  in  mind  the
    interests of the children and the fact that  they  had  been  separated
    from their father for a long period, as had their mother.  However,  it
    seemed to him that this could have been remedied by a fresh application
    as soon as it was known that the current application did not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.

6.   The length of the separation was the only compelling  circumstance  put
    before him as justification for a grant outside the Rules.  He repeated
    that if, as seemed to be the case, the financial requirements were  now
    met he could see no reason why a fresh application should not  succeed.
    There would be some delay in reuniting the family but that  was  caused
    by the fact that they chose to put in an application at a time when the
    Rules could not be met and then chose to pursue the appeal rather  than
    put  in  a  fresh  application.   For  these  reasons  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.

The Grounds and Submissions

7.   In the grounds it is argued that, whilst the provisions of Appendix FM-
    SE provided under para D that in deciding an application under Appendix
    FM-SE  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  could  only  consider  documents
    submitted with the application save for specified exceptions which  did
    not apply, by virtue of s.85(4) and (5) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 read with s.85A(2) it was open  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to consider circumstances as at  the  date  of  decision.  The
    judge was therefore obliged  to  have  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
    evidence demonstrated at that time  that  the  sponsor  had  sufficient
    earnings.

8.   In respect of article 8 it is argued that the judge  erred  by  finding
    that the only fact which might amount to a compelling  factor  was  the
    length of separation when at the time of the appeal it  was  no  longer
    open to the third appellant to apply as he was over  18.   The  sponsor
    was a British citizen but still too afraid to return to Sri Lanka as he
    considered he would be at risk.  The judge had therefore failed to take
    into account the circumstances of the separation as a  factor  relevant
    to the assessment of article 8.

9.   At the hearing before me Mr Yeo adopted the grounds and relied  on  the
    Tribunal decisions in DR (ECO: post-decision evidence) Morocco*  [2005]
    UKIAT 00038 and LS (post-decision evidence;  direction;  appealability)
    Gambia [2005] UKAIT 00085.  He submitted that the provisions of s.84(4)
    and (5) required the judge to look at the circumstances  applicable  at
    the time of the decision to refuse.  This was not a points-based scheme
    appeal and therefore did not fall within s.85(5)(a).  There were  cases
    where there was a historic timeline: see NA and Others  (Tier  1  Post-
    Study Work, funds) [2009] UKAIT 00025 but he argued that, certainly  so
    far as self-employed income was concerned, there was no  such  historic
    timeline in Appendix FM-SE.  Further, para D explicitly referred to the
    Entry Clearance Officer and the Secretary of State  and  could  not  be
    taken as overriding the statutory powers in s.85.  In the absence of  a
    historic timeline, the proper course was to fall back on  the  approach
    set out in LS (Gambia).

10.  Mr Yeo submitted that the judge had erred by failing, when  considering
    article 8, to consider the delay in the light of all the  circumstances
    of the appeal.  The fact remained that at  the  date  of  decision  the
    sponsor did have sufficient  earnings  within  the  Rules  although  he
    accepted that by that time the third appellant by  virtue  of  his  age
    fell outside the requirements of the Rules.

11.  Mr Walker submitted that whilst the arguments in relation to article  8
    may well have substance, there was no merit in the appeal  in  relation
    to the Rules.  The appellants were required to  produce  the  specified
    evidence with the application and by necessary implication there was  a
    historic timeline as part of the Rules.  The position was made clear by
    the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for the Home Department v  SS
    (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387,  which  the  judge  had  been  correct  to
    follow.

Assessment of whether there is an Error of Law

     (i)  The Rules

12.  I will deal firstly with the issue of whether the  judge  was  entitled
    to take into account evidence of the sponsor's finances at the date  of
    decision as opposed to the date of application when considering whether
    the requirements of the Rules were met.  The provisions of Appendix FM-
    SE set out the specified evidence applicants need to  provide  to  meet
    the requirements of the rules in Appendix FM.  At para D it is provided
    that, in deciding an application in  relation  to  which  the  Appendix
    states that specified documents must be provided, the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer will consider documents  that  have  been  submitted  with  the
    application and  will  only  consider  documents  submitted  after  the
    application where specified subparagraphs apply, it being common ground
    that neither do in the present case.

13.  In relation  to  self-employment  the  requirement  is  that  specified
    documents for the last full financial year (or for the  last  two  such
    years where the documents show the necessary level for gross income  as
    an average for those two years) must be submitted including  an  annual
    self-assessment tax return and if the business is required  to  produce
    annual audited accounts, such accounts for the last full financial year
    or if not so required an accountant's certificate of confirmation: para
    7.

14.  It is clear from Appendix FM-SE that  the  specified  evidence  of  the
    required  income  must  be  produced  with  the  application.  In   the
    appellants' case, in respect of an application made  on  6  March  2014
    that was for the last full financial year, 2012 - 2013.  The reason the
    application was made on 6 March 2014 was because  the  third  appellant
    was at that stage still under 18, his birthday  being  15  March  1996.
    After that date he fell outside the definition  of  a  dependent  child
    within Appendix FM.  The  appellants  subsequently  sought  to  produce
    evidence relating to financial year 2013 - 2014 but that post-dated the
    date of application.

15.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo) at [50]  -  [53]  and
    [58], as set out in the First-tier Tribunal's decision,  has  confirmed
    that the evidential requirements of the Rules are to be treated in  the
    same way as the substantive requirements  of  the  Rules  and  must  be
    established at the date of application.  At [58], the Court  said  that
    an appeal against a decision refusing leave to enter was to be heard by
    the First-tier Tribunal by reference to the evidence and  circumstances
    which applied when the matter was considered  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.  These circumstances  include  the  requirement  to  meet  the
    evidential requirements of the Rules as at the date of application.

16.  I am therefore satisfied that the judge was right to find that  he  was
    not entitled to take into account the financial circumstances as at the
    date of decision as opposed to the date of application.  In relation to
    an appeal against the refusal of entry  clearance,  the  provisions  of
    s.85(5) set out that the judge could only  consider  the  circumstances
    appertaining  at  the  time  of  the   decision   to   refuse.    Those
    circumstances refer to what needed to be proved, including  income,  as
    evidenced in accordance with the Rules  at  the  date  of  application.
    There was, therefore, a historic time-line and it was not open  to  the
    appellants to rely on the facts as they were at the date of decision.

     (ii)  Article 8

17.  I now turn to consider the position under article 8.   In  the  grounds
    of appeal it is argued that the judge erred in law by failing  to  take
    into account a number of relevant factors including the  fact  that  by
    the time  the  decision  was  taken,  evidence  had  been  provided  to
    demonstrate that the appellants could meet the  financial  requirements
    of the Rules and that it was no longer open to the third  appellant  to
    apply under the Rules as he was now over 18.  The sponsor had become  a
    British citizen but was too  afraid  to  return  to  Sri  Lanka  as  he
    considered he would be at risk.  The grounds refer to SS (Congo)  where
    the Court of Appeal specifically referred to the circumstances  of  the
    separation as being relevant to the assessment of article 8.

18.  It is also argued that the respondent appeared  to  take  into  account
    evidence relating to another appeal, representations and accounts  from
    chartered accountants.  It is also said that the review decision by the
    Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) had asserted that family  life  could  be
    resumed in India when neither the appellants nor the sponsor  had  ever
    lived there.  There is no substance in these two grounds.  It  is  true
    that papers relating to another application were included in error with
    these appeal papers but nothing to indicate that the  decision  or  ECM
    review took them into account.  It is also correct that the ECM  review
    referred to whether it  was  reasonable  for  the  family  to  live  in
    India/Sri  Lanka  but  this  is  simply  a  failure   to   delete   the
    inappropriate country.

19.  It is argued that the judge failed to have regard to the fact  that  at
    the date of decision the sponsor was earning  in  excess  of  what  was
    required by the Rules but at [30]  the  judge  noted  when  considering
    article 8 that he was not restricted to considering income  as  at  the
    date of application.  The fact that in the  financial  year  after  the
    specified financial year  for  the  purposes  of  the  application  the
    respondent did meet the requirements was  accepted  as  a  circumstance
    known at the time of decision.  The judge  did  not  deal  specifically
    with the fact that it was the appellants' claim that  the  sponsor  was
    afraid to return to Sri Lanka as he considered that he would  still  be
    at risk nor did he refer in terms  to  the  fact  that  the  third  and
    potentially the fourth child would no longer be able to  qualify  under
    the Rules.  In this context the judge said that if, as seemed to be the
    case, the financial requirements were now met that he saw no reason why
    a fresh application would not succeed.  This overlooks the  point  that
    on a fresh application  the  third  appellant  could  no  longer  bring
    himself within the eligibility requirements of the Rules.

20.  The position was therefore not as the judge  appears  to  have  assumed
    one where there was no reason why a fresh application would not succeed
    but one where there would need to be a further consideration of whether
    the third and potentially the fourth appellant  could  succeed  outside
    the Rules.  The judge commented  that  the  position  could  have  been
    remedied by a fresh application as  soon  as  it  was  known  that  the
    current application did not meet the requirements of the  Rules.  I  am
    therefore satisfied that the judge erred in law by  proceeding  on  the
    basis that an application under the Rules was  likely  to  succeed  and
    that there was no need for him to consider article 8.

Re-making the Decision under Article 8

21.  As this is an out of country appeal I must consider the position as  at
    the date of decision. In SS (Congo) the Court of Appeal confirmed  that
    in entry clearance cases the appropriate general  formulation  in  such
    cases  is  that  an  applicant  will  need  to  show  that   compelling
    circumstances exist not sufficiently recognised under the new Rules  so
    as to require the grant of  leave.   This  is  described  as  a  fairly
    demanding test reflecting the reasonable relationship between the Rules
    themselves and the proper outcome of article 8  in  the  usual  run  of
    cases but is not as demanding as the exceptionality or very  compelling
    circumstances  test   applicable   in   specific   contexts   such   as
    precariousness of family relationship  and  deportation  of  foreigners
    convicted of serious crimes [40] - [41]. The  appellants  do  not  fall
    within either of these categories but, nonetheless, the  importance  of
    the procedural requirements of the rules must be taken into account.

22.  In this context the Court of Appeal at [58]  in  SS  (Congo)  expressed
    concerns about applications being made at a time when the  requirements
    of the Rules were not satisfied in  the  hope  that  by  the  time  the
    appellate process  had  been  exhausted  those  requirements  would  be
    satisfied. It is arguable that the application made in the present case
    in March 2014 was based on unrealised possible future  compliance  with
    the Rules but that the  facts  would  in  any  event  have  had  to  be
    considered at the date of  decision  rather  than  at  the  date  of  a
    prospective appeal hearing.  The application was perhaps speculative on
    the outcome of MM but in any event it must have been envisaged that  in
    so far as the Rules could not be  met  the  appellants  would  rely  on
    article 8.   Whatever  the  position,  taking  into  account  the  long
    separation, the fact that an application could not be  made  until  the
    sponsor achieved settled status and his claimed fears of  returning  to
    Sri Lanka, I am satisfied applying the approach in SS (Congo) that this
    a case where the appeal can properly  be  considered  under  article  8
    outside the Rules.

23.  I am satisfied that there is family  life  within  article  8(1).   The
    third appellant was over 18 when the decision was made  but  there  was
    nothing to indicate that he did not remain a member of the family.  The
    decision to refuse entry clearance is sufficiently  serious  to  engage
    article 8.  It was lawful decision and was made for  a  legitimate  aim
    within article 8(2).  The remaining issue is whether  the  decision  is
    proportionate.

24.  It is common ground that an application by the appellants save for  the
    third appellant if  made  at  the  date  of  decision  would  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules. I must also take into account the fact  that
    the applications could only realistically be made after the sponsor had
    acquired settled status, having come to the UK in 2002.   I  must  take
    into account the fact that when the application was lodged on  6  March
    2014 evidence had to be supported  by  the  earnings  in  the  previous
    financial year.  The applicants, had they delayed the application until
    April 2014, would have been able to rely on the 2013/2014 accounts  and
    tax return but by that time the third appellant would  have  been  over
    18.  So far as the Rules  are  concerned  these  considerations  cannot
    benefit the appellants as they amount to a near  miss  argument  but  a
    more fact-sensitive  approach  is  appropriate  in  article  8  appeals
    subject, of course, to keeping in mind the nature and  purpose  of  the
    Rules, to provide a workable,  predictable  and  consistent  system  in
    which applications can be assessed.

25.  The sponsor has maintained throughout that he is not able to return  to
    Sri Lanka because of a continuing fear of persecution and he is  now  a
    British citizen.  Taking into account this factor with  the  length  of
    the family's separation and the fact that as at the date of decision at
    least the substantive requirements of the Rules could be met so far  as
    the first, second and fourth appellants are concerned, I  am  satisfied
    that it would be disproportionate for  them  to  be  refused  leave  to
    enter.  So far as the third appellant is concerned in light of the fact
    that, although over 18 he still remained a member of the family and the
    requirements of the Rules were met save for the fact that he  was  over
    18, it would be disproportionate for him to be left in the position  of
    a stranded sibling and he also should be granted leave to enter.

Decision

26.  I am not satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law  in  its
    assessment of the application under the Immigration Rules  but  it  did
    err in respect of article 8.  I  substitute  a  decision  allowing  the
    appeal on article 8 grounds in respect of all appellants. No  anonymity
    order was made by the First-tier Tribunal.
