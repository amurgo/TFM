For the appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, NW, and his twin sister AN, are citizens of Uganda.

 2. The Secretary of State appealed  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Crawford promulgated 25.2.15,  allowing,  on  article  8
    human rights grounds, the claimants' appeals against  the  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer, dated 30.7.13, to refuse  entry  clearance
    to the United Kingdom to join their maternal aunt JN, recognised  as  a
    refugee in the UK. The Judge heard the appeal on 11.2.15.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Levin  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    27.4.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 14.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. In my error of law decision promulgated 4.8.15 I found errors of law in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    determination of Judge Crawford should be  set  aside  and  remade.  In
    essence, I  found  that  there  was  inadequate  justification  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal to consider the appeal outside  the
    Immigration Rules. I also found that there was inadequate consideration
    of the public interest factors of section 117A, and that the article  8
    assessment was inadequately reasoned.

 6. The matter then came back to me for a continuation hearing  on  21.9.15
    at Field House. However, as counsel was late  arriving  and  there  had
    been no compliance with my directions for preparation of the claimant's
    bundle, no interpreter requested, and insufficient time  to  deal  with
    the case, the appeal had to be further adjourned.

 7. At the aborted  hearing  of  14.7.15,  following  discussion  with  the
    parties, I confirmed that those findings of fact of Judge  Crawford  up
    to and including �24 are preserved. The remaining issues are  at  large
    and evidence will be required, although much of the decision to be made
    will be the application of the law to these  facts,  including  whether
    there are such compelling circumstances  insufficiently  recognised  in
    the Rules as to justify going on to consider article 8 ECHR at all.

 8. The appeal thus came back before me in the Upper Tribunal on  24.11.15.
    The start of the hearing was delayed because the  Lugandan  interpreter
    booked did not arrive until almost noon.

 9. I heard further evidence from the sponsor JN, with  the  assistance  of
    the interpreter. However, as this is an  out  of  country  appeal,  the
    decision has to be made on the basis of the circumstances prevailing at
    the date of refusal decision, 30.7.13, and,  inevitably,  some  of  the
    evidence strayed  beyond  that  date.  There  was  some  difficulty  in
    clarifying exactly what the relevant circumstances of the two claimants
    were at that date and the sponsor was not the clearest witness, some of
    her account seemed to change, particularly as to who was looking  after
    the children in July 2013.

10. I accept and adopt the findings of Judge Crawford that prior to  coming
    to the UK as a refugee on 5.3.12, the sponsor lived in  a  family  unit
    with  her  own  children  and  the  claimants.  I  make  the  following
    additional findings and observations.

11. Whilst the originally three, now two, children were not the  sponsor's,
    but her sister's, I accept that following her sister's death  in  2001,
    they were taken in at a very  young  age  by  the  sponsor  and  raised
    alongside her own children. There was no formal adoption  process.  The
    sponsor could have simply claimed they were all her children,  but  she
    honestly explained the situation.

12. I have considered the various handwritten letters from the claimants in
    the appeal bundle. It is not entirely clear  that  the  children  wrote
    these letters, given the very neat handwriting in English  with  barely
    an error or correction. However, I conclude on the  lower  standard  of
    proof that they provide for themselves by foraging in the forest.  They
    are no longer able to attend school. The letters are  very  moving  and
    express love and affection for the sponsor, addressed as mummy, and her
    biological children, referred to as their brother  and  sisters.  There
    are also letters from the sponsor's children in the UK, explaining  how
    much they miss the claimants. They plead to be reunited as a family.

13. I find that at the date of  the  refusal  decision  in  July  2013  the
    claimants were either being looked after by the sponsor's former  maid,
    Susan, or Susan's mother. The sponsor's evidence on this  was  unclear,
    they were first looked after by Susan and later by her mother.  Susan's
    mother passed away in  2014  and  the  children  are  now  fending  for
    themselves.

14. There can be little doubt and I accept on the evidence  that  prior  to
    the sponsor's departure from Uganda, the claimants enjoyed family  life
    together with the sponsor and the sponsor's three natural children.

15. The sponsor's asylum claim was initially refused, but allowed prior  to
    appeal. Her witness  statement  of  28.3.14  adopts  and  exhibits  the
    undated witness statement prepared in advance of the appeal hearing. Mr
    Whitwell took no real issue with the background and factual claim.

16. Subsequent to the grant of asylum, application was made  in  July  2013
    for both the sponsor's three natural children and the two claimants  to
    join her in the UK. The  applications  of  the  natural  children  were
    granted and they joined the sponsor in the UK  in  November  2013.  The
    applications for the two claimants  were  refused,  hence  the  present
    appeal.

17. It is common ground that the claimants cannot meet the requirements  of
    either paragraph 309A in relation to de facto  adoption,  or  paragraph
    352D in relation to  family  reunion  in  refugee  cases,  because  the
    claimants are not the children of the sponsor, or paragraph 319X  as  a
    relative of a refugee, because of the financial requirements which  the
    sponsor cannot meet. There is  no  Immigration  Rule  route  for  these
    claimants in the circumstances of the sponsor's flight from Uganda  and
    arrival here as a refugee.

18. Ms Easty makes the valid point that the sponsor could not have  applied
    for any of the children to join  her  until  she  was  granted  refugee
    status in the UK.  The  consequence  is  that  at  the  date  of  their
    applications the  claimants  could  not  meet  paragraph  309A  of  the
    Immigration Rules in relation to a de facto  adoption,  which  requires
    them to have lived together for a minimum period of 18 months of  which
    the 12 months immediately preceding the application for entry clearance
    must have been spent together. It was thus  a  practical  impossibility
    for the claimants to meet the de facto adoption requirements. Ms  Easty
    submitted that the Rule is unfair  and  incompatible  with  article  8,
    because it discriminated against children of  refugees.  The  Rule  has
    been the subject of judicial criticism  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  AA
    (Somalia) (FC) v Entry Clearance Officer -Addis Ababa [2013]  UKSC  81,
    where, at �25 Lord Carnwath  opined  that  if  clear  definitions  were
    required to establish 'bright lines' the argument  loses  most  of  its
    force if the bright lines are drawn so restrictively that they have  in
    practice to be supplemented by the much fuzzier lines drawn by  article
    8. It was suggested that the Rule ought to be amended to bring it  into
    alignment with international  obligations  and  the  practice  actually
    adopted by the Secretary of State.

19. A similar situation prevailed in AA (Somalia) v Entry Clearance Officer
    -Addis Ababa [2012] EWCA Civ 563. At �35 Lord Justice Davis agreed that
    appears to be unlikely that most of such applicants would  not  satisfy
    the de facto adoption requirements, "But that  as  I  see  it,  is  the
    balance the Secretary of State has struck.  There  were  and  are  very
    difficult issues relating to entry of children claimed to be  de  facto
    adopted children.... The balance struck is thus that expressly set  out
    in the relevant Immigration Rules, in determining who is to be regarded
    as a 'child of a parent' for this purpose. However, at �41,  the  judge
    concluded that this interpretation of the  Immigration  Rules  did  not
    lead to any great lacuna. "It must not be forgotten that Article  8  of
    the Convention is always available to be relied on  in  an  appropriate
    case - indeed AA in  the  present  case  succeeded  on  precisely  that
    ground.  Further,  it  may  be,  for  example,   that   applicants   in
    corresponding  circumstances  may  in  some  cases  be  able  to  claim
    eligibility for family reunion on compelling compassionate grounds.  It
    is also stated at �43, "In any event, as I see it, the balance has been
    struck in the Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State in a way open
    to her; and, further, applicants such as AA are able  to  invoke  their
    rights under Article 8 in an appropriate case."

20. I have considered the issue raised at  the  hearing  before  me  by  Mr
    Whitwell, as to  whether  it  can  properly  be  said  that  there  are
    compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised in  the  Immigration
    Rules so as to justify granting entry clearly under article 8,  on  the
    basis that the refusal decision is unjustifiably  harsh,  or  otherwise
    disproportionate. The argument is that given  that  paragraph  319X(ii)
    includes a requirement and consideration  of  "serious  and  compelling
    family or other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the  child
    undesirable.." there is no need to look outside the Rules.  However,  I
    note the refusal decision did not address  paragraph  319X  and  it  is
    conceded that the claimants cannot meet the financial  requirements  of
    319X(vii). Ms Easty does not concede that  there  are  no  serious  and
    compelling considerations, only that the financial requirements  cannot
    be met.

21. In all the circumstances, I am  satisfied  that  there  are  compelling
    circumstances on the facts of this case, inadequately reflected in  the
    Immigration Rules, so as to justify consideration outside the Rules  on
    the basis of family life under article 8 ECHR.

22. In considering article 8, I bear in mind that it is relevant  and  must
    be taken into account, which I do, that the claimants cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, which form the Secretary of State's response
    to private and family life claims.

23. I also bear in mind the section 55 duty, to have  regard  to  the  best
    interests of the children, and do so, both in respect of the  claimants
    and the sponsor's natural children in  the  UK.  I  am  satisfied  that
    notwithstanding their cultural background and lives in Uganda, the best
    interests of the claimants are to be reunited with both sponsor and her
    children so that they can continue family life.

24. Both Mr Whitwell and Ms Easty  agreed  that  in  consideration  of  the
    Razgar stepped approach to article 8, the first four steps are met  and
    that the crucial issue is the proportionality assessment. I accept that
    there was family life between the claimants and the sponsor, and indeed
    between them and her three biological children. On  the  basis  of  the
    preserved findings of Judge Crawford, Mr Whitwell  does  not  challenge
    the existence of family life. That family life  is  gravely  interfered
    with by the decision to refuse entry clearance.  However,  the  refusal
    was lawful and in  pursuit  of  a  legitimate  aim  of  protecting  the
    economic well-being of the UK through immigration control. The  crucial
    issue is, as in most cases, the proportionality.

25. I take into account as I must pursuant to section 117A & B of the  2002
    Act that immigration control is in the public interest. It would appear
    that the claimants can speak English but  they  are  not  going  to  be
    financially  independent,  given  that  the  sponsor  herself  is   not
    financially independent. These factors weigh against the claimants.

26. In addition to the above factors and in particular the public  interest
    in immigration control, if granted entry clearance  the  claimants  are
    going to be a burden on the State. Further, despite the letters written
    in good English, given that the sponsor herself speaks  little  English
    and required an interpreter, I am  not  satisfied  that  the  claimants
    speak English. Section 117B provides that it is in the public  interest
    that those seeking to enter the UK speak English. I take into  account,
    even if they are fending for themselves now, that at the  date  of  the
    refusal decision they were being looked after. The also reside in their
    home country, where they have social and cultural ties.

27. On the other hand, in the proportionality  balancing  exercise  between
    the public interest in exclusion and the rights of  the  claimants  and
    the sponsor and her family to continuation of  family  life  there  are
    significant factors in favour of the claimants. I bear in mind that  at
    this stage it is for the Secretary of State  to  demonstrate  that  the
    decision is proportionate to their rights. First, the  claimants  spent
    some 12 years living as a family unit with the sponsor and her  natural
    children, raised by her as their mother with no distinction between the
    children. The family was divided only because of the circumstances  now
    accepted by the Secretary of State that resulted in the flight  of  the
    sponsor from persecution in Uganda, leaving behind  all  her  children.
    She was not able to bring them with her, for the reasons set out in her
    witness statement. She made application for them all to join her,  once
    she was granted refugee status. It was not practically possible  to  do
    so before then. It follows  that  by  the  delay  in  granting  refugee
    status, the claimants lost the opportunity to join the sponsor  in  the
    UK under paragraph 309A. A  further  separation  took  place  when  the
    natural children were  granted  entry  clearance  but  these  claimants
    refused. As a refugee the sponsor cannot  return  to  Uganda  and  thus
    family life cannot be continued there. I have to consider not just  the
    family life rights of the claimants but also those of the  sponsor  and
    her natural children. Effectively,  this  was  one  single  family  for
    several years before the sponsor was forced to flee Uganda. There  must
    be in the circumstances a significant public interest in permitting the
    family as a whole to be reunited; it is in the best  interests  of  the
    claimants and the nature children of the  sponsor.  The  separation  of
    family members was caused by factors  outside  the  sponsor's  and  the
    claimants' control.

28. Taking all of these  factors,  both  for  and  against  the  claimants,
    together in the round, it becomes very clear that there are  compelling
    and compassionate circumstances which make the  refusal  decision  both
    unjustifiably harsh and entirely disproportionate.  The  balance  falls
    clearly and firmly in favour of the  claimants  such  that  the  appeal
    against refusal of entry clearance should be allowed.

Decision:

                    The appeal of each claimant on  immigration  grounds  is
                    dismissed;

                    The appeal of each claimant on human rights  grounds  is
                    allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order. Given the circumstances, I  continue  the  anonymity
order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a full fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been allowed.
