Representation:
For the Appellant:         Mr J Chipperfield of counsel instructed by
                    Visa Legal Ltd
For the Respondent:        Mr T Melvin a Senior Home Office Presenting
                    Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.       The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who was born  on  2  November
    1978. Following a hearing on 13 November 2014  where  I  sat  with  Mrs
    Justice Andrews  we  found  that  there  were  errors  of  law  in  the
    determination of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Kaler ("the FTTJ")  who  had
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision  of
    19 December 2013 to refuse to grant her a derivative residence card  as
    the primary carer of a British child under the provisions of Regulation
    15A of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  ("the
    2006 Regulations"). We set aside her decision  and  directed  that  the
    appeal be reheard  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  with  oral  evidence.  The
    findings of fact made by the FTTJ were not preserved. Our  reasons  and
    conclusion are set out in a Decision and Directions dated  14  November
    2014 which is set out in the Appendix to this Determination.

2.       It is in these circumstances that the appeal comes  before  me  for
    rehearing. The appellant has changed her solicitors. She  attended  the
    hearing together with her two daughters and her son although he  stayed
    outside the hearing room. I have all the documents  which  were  before
    the FTTJ together  with  a  supplementary  bundle  from  the  appellant
    submitted with a letter  of  23  December  2014,  a  request  from  the
    appellant's solicitors to extend the grounds  of  appeal  to  encompass
    Article 8 grounds, a skeleton argument prepared by Mr Chipperfield,  JM
    v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1402 and Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano; reg 15A (3)  (c)
    2006 EEA Regs) [2013] UKUT  00089  (IAC).  Mr  Melvin  put  in  written
    submissions accompanied by a copy of  a  standard  form  of  "Statutory
    Declaration of Acknowledgement of Parentage" and an  extract  from  the
    Home Office computer records relating  to  the  appellant.  During  the
    course of the hearing I was handed a small bundle of  copy  photographs
    showing members of the appellant's family, a printout  of  Home  Office
    records relating to the appellant and  the  appellant's  son's  British
    passport. Copies of the identity page in the passport  were  taken  and
    the  original  returned.  Neither  representative   objected   to   the
    production of these documents.

3.       Mr Chipperfield informed me that the witness  statements  from  the
    appellant and her two daughters in the latest appellant's  bundle  were
    intended to replace earlier witness statements. It was considered  that
    these contained errors made by former solicitors  which  needed  to  be
    corrected. He asked whether the respondent  was  challenging  the  fact
    that the appellant's son was a British citizen. Mr Melvin accepted that
    for the purpose of the proceedings before the  Tribunal  he  should  be
    treated as a British citizen.

4.       Both representatives agreed that the issue  at  the  core  of  this
    appeal was whether, if the appellant had  to  return  to  Jamaica,  his
    natural father could look after his  son.  Initially,  Mr  Chipperfield
    accepted that the conclusion would be the same whether it  was  reached
    under Regulation 15A or on Article 8  human  rights  grounds.  However,
    during the course of his  submissions  he  withdrew  this  and  instead
    submitted that Article 8 grounds should be  considered  if  the  appeal
    failed under Regulation 15A.

5.       I heard oral evidence from the appellant and  both  her  daughters.
    Their evidence is set out  in  my  record  of  proceedings.  They  were
    examined in chief, cross examined and, except for one of the daughters,
    re-examined. I asked some questions for the purpose  of  clarification.
    Mr Melvin's cross examination of all three witnesses  was  lengthy  and
    detailed.

6.       Mr Melvin relied on his skeleton argument and the  refusal  letter.
    The appeal turned on Regulation 15A and the question of whether if  the
    appellant went back to Jamaica there was anyone  else  who  could  look
    after her son. His main submission was that his father could look after
    him. The only other possibility  was  his  grandmother  but  Mr  Melvin
    submitted that the evidence about her was unclear  and  unreliable.  It
    was not apparent whether she lived in the UK or the USA and whether she
    saw him on a regular basis.

7.       Mr Melvin said that the respondent did not accept  that  Mr  M  was
    the natural father  of  the  appellant's  son.  However,  for  ease  of
    reference I will refer to the child as the son of  his  father  (Mr  M)
    until such time as I determine this issue. I asked Mr Melvin why it was
    suggested that the father would be the person to look after the son  if
    he was not in  fact  his  natural  father.  Mr  Melvin  said  that  the
    respondent's position was that, whatever their biological  status,  the
    father could look after him.

8.       Mr Melvin submitted that I  had  not  been  told  the  correct  and
    truthful position by the appellant or her daughters. There was  a  lack
    of documentary evidence to corroborate their claims. There  was  little
    evidence to show that there was any lengthy  relationship  between  the
    father and the son. When the appellant first registered  the  birth  of
    her son his father was not named. It was only approximately 2  ï¿½  years
    later that the application was made to add the name of the father.  The
    appellant had failed to give any persuasive reason for her  claim  that
    after she and the father had lived apart without any contact for such a
    long time he would contact her and name her as his next of kin when  he
    was seriously ill in hospital.  It  was  not  credible  that  he  would
    suddenly wish to give his name to  his  son  or  to  obtain  a  British
    passport for him. The father had not  provided  a  statement  or  given
    evidence for the appellant.

9.       Mr  Melvin  argued  that  if  the  father  had  made  the  passport
    application for his son  he  would  have  had  to  state  that  he  was
    accepting parental responsibility for him. It was not  likely  that  if
    the appellant was so determined to establish her status in the  UK  she
    would not have made an application during the period she was the spouse
    of an EEA national. Mr Melvin  accepted  that  the  appellant  had  not
    attended the appeal hearing in 2008 and that the appeal was  determined
    on the papers.

10.      His contention was that the daughters had been primed  as  to  what
    to say by their mother. He asked me to find that none of the  witnesses
    were credible in relation to their evidence as to the relationship  and
    contact  with  the  father.  There  was  no  evidence  to  support  the
    contention that Social Services had  not  made  any  effort  to  obtain
    payment from the father to support his son or that he was incapable  of
    providing such support. The appeal stood or fell on  the  basis  of  my
    findings in relation to Regulation 15A and Article 8 did not  apply.  I
    was asked to dismiss the appeal.

11.      Mr Chipperfield submitted that the issues were  narrow  and  clear.
    The  appeal  turned  on  the  credibility  of  the  appellant  and  her
    daughters. JM was still good law and the appeal should be considered on
    Article 8 human rights grounds as well as under Regulation 15A  if  the
    latter failed. The individual referred to as the daughters' grandmother
    was not the son's grandmother. I was  asked  to  find  that  all  three
    witnesses were credible and to allow the appeal.

12.      I reserved my determination.

13.      I find that this appeal turns on the credibility of  the  appellant
    and her daughters. One of the main factors  advance  by  Mr  Melvin  in
    support of his contention that they were not credible was the  lack  of
    documentary evidence to support what they said. The appellant relies on
    her latest bundle and it is true to say state that this contains little
    supporting  documentary  evidence.  The  letter  from  Lambeth  Council
    confirms the financial support being provided for the appellant and her
    children but says nothing relevant to the relationship between the  son
    and his father. Only one of the letters of support  from  friends  says
    anything about the father. It states that he plays no  father  role  in
    his son's life.

14.      The Home Office records  make  reference  to  a  reported  domestic
    incident with a man whose name is not the same as the father  in  which
    it is said that the appellant was then  pregnant  and  that  the  named
    individual was the father of her child. The appellant  says  that  this
    was a mistake and that the individual was neither her partner  nor  the
    father of her son. I note that the Home Office records also state  that
    checks were made with Lambeth Registry Office and confirmation obtained
    that re-registration of birth did take place to add  the  name  of  the
    father to the original birth certificate. Mr Melvin  has  conceded  for
    the purpose of proceedings before  the  Tribunal  that  the  son  is  a
    British Citizen. His mother, the appellant, is not  a  British  citizen
    and the son could not have been registered as a British citizen  unless
    his father was a British citizen.

15.      The appellant has provided a detailed explanation  as  to  why  the
    father's name was not  added  to  the  son's  birth  certificate  until
    approximately 2 ï¿½ years after his birth. She has also explained why she
    did not make an application for leave to remain as the spouse of an EEA
    national during the period when she was married  to  a  Frenchman.  She
    said that she did not believe that she could do so because he  was  not
    employed. These explanations are not inherently  implausible  and  must
    stand or fall with my assessment of her credibility as a  whole.  There
    is no DNA evidence to show paternity although the appellant's  evidence
    was that she had not been in contact with the father for some time  and
    that he had health and alcohol-related problems.

16.      I found the appellant and her daughters to  be  clear  and  on  the
    whole  consistent  witnesses.  Mr  Melvin  conducted  searching   cross
    examinations. The elder daughter was an impressive witness particularly
    in her ability to remember precise  dates.  The  younger  daughter  was
    vaguer. All three witnesses gave broadly consistent evidence in  answer
    to questions about  family  relationships  including  some  about  more
    distant relatives in whom the daughters had little interest. Overall  I
    find that their evidence about important  matters  was  consistent  and
    that  inconsistencies  were  minor.  I  detected  no  evidence  of  the
    daughters having been coached in any way. On the contrary, I gained the
    strong impression that they were speaking from their own recollections.

17.      It is on the face of it  strange  that  the  appellant  would  have
    parted from the father before the birth of their  son  because  of  the
    consequences  of  his  drinking,  had  no  contact  with  him   for   a
    considerable time and then, when he was seriously ill and  in  hospital
    for a kidney transplant, that he would name her as his next of kin  and
    she would go to see him taking with her the son he had never seen.  Her
    explanation was that nobody else had been to  see  him  and  she  felt,
    after the lapse of time, that  he  should  see  his  son  and  have  an
    opportunity to build a relationship with him. The fact that these hopes
    did not bear fruit does  not  make  it  any  less  plausible  that  the
    appellant would have tried or that they would have  cooperated  to  add
    the father to the birth certificate and that he would have applied  for
    his son's passport.

18.      Looking at all the evidence in the round and accepting  that  there
    are factors which militate both for and against the credibility of  the
    appellant and her daughters I have come to the conclusion that they are
    credible witnesses. I accept their evidence in all material respects.

19.      Paragraph 15A of the 2006 Regulations provides;

         "15A. Derivative right of residence


             (1)  A person ("P") who is  not  entitled  to  reside  in  the
                  United Kingdom as a result of any other provision of these
                  Regulations and who satisfies the  criteria  in  paragraph
                  (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this regulation is entitled  to  a
                  derivative right to reside in the United  Kingdom  for  as
                  long as P satisfies the relevant criteria.


             (2)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


                  (a)      P is the primary carer of an EEA  national  ("the
                      relevant EEA national"); and


                  (b)      the relevant EEA national-


                      (i)  is under the age of 18;


                      (ii) is residing in the United  Kingdom  as  a  self-
                           sufficient person; and


                      (iii)         would be unable to remain in the United
                           Kingdom if P were required to leave.


             (3)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


                  (a)      P is the child  of  an  EEA  national  ("the  EEA
                      national parent");


                  (b)      P resided in the United Kingdom at  a  time  when
                      the EEA national parent was residing  in  the  United
                      Kingdom as a worker; and


                  (c)      P is in education in the United Kingdom  and  was
                      in education there at a time when  the  EEA  national
                      parent was in the United Kingdom.


             (4)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


                  (a)      P is the primary carer of a  person  meeting  the
                      criteria in paragraph (3)  ("the  relevant  person");
                      and


                  (b)      the relevant person would be unable  to  continue
                      to be educated  in  the  United  Kingdom  if  P  were
                      required to leave.


             (5)  P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


                  (a)      P is under the age of 18;


                  (b)      P's primary carer is  entitled  to  a  derivative
                      right to reside in the United Kingdom  by  virtue  of
                      paragraph (2) or (4);


                  (c)      P does not have leave to enter, or remain in, the
                      United Kingdom; and


                  (d)      requiring P to leave  the  United  Kingdom  would
                      prevent P's primary carer from residing in the United
                      Kingdom.


             (6)  For the purpose of this regulation-


                  (a)      "education" excludes nursery education; and


                  (b)      "worker" does not include a jobseeker or a person
                      who falls to be regarded as a  worker  by  virtue  of
                      regulation 6(2).


             (7)  P is to be regarded  as  a  "primary  carer"  of  another
                  person if


                  (a)      P is a direct relative or  a  legal  guardian  of
                      that person; and


                  (b)      P-


                      (i)  is the person who has primary responsibility for
                           that person's care; or


                      (ii)  shares  equally  the  responsibility  for  that
                           person's care with one other person  who  is  not
                           entitled to reside in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
                           result  of   any   other   provision   of   these
                           Regulations and who does not have leave to  enter
                           or remain.


             (8)  P will not be regarded as  having  responsibility  for  a
                  person's care for the purpose of paragraph (7) on the sole
                  basis of a financial contribution  towards  that  person's
                  care.


             (9)   A  person  who  otherwise  satisfies  the  criteria   in
                  paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5) will not be entitled  to  a
                  derivative right to reside in the United Kingdom where the
                  Secretary of State has made a  decision  under  regulation
                  19(3)(b), 20(1) or 20A(1).".


20.      I find that the father is the natural father of  his  son  who  was
    born on 31 December 2008. He has always lived with  the  appellant.  He
    has never lived with his father. The appellant and the father separated
    when  she  was  three  months  pregnant.  They  separated  because   of
    difficulties within the family caused by  the  father's  drinking.  The
    father did not see or support the son between December 2008  and  April
    2011. In April 2011 the father was  seriously  ill  and  had  a  kidney
    transplant. At his request the appellant was contacted and she took her
    son to see his father in hospital. The two  of  them  agreed  that  the
    father should be added to the birth  certificate.  An  application  was
    made for this to be done and the birth  certificate  was  amended.  The
    father applied for and his son was issued with a British passport. This
    was sent direct to the appellant.  Subsequently  there  was  occasional
    contact between the father and his son always in the  presence  of  the
    appellant. The appellant  was  concerned  because  the  father  started
    drinking again soon after the kidney transplant. The father was invited
    to his son's birthday party at the end of  2011  and  put  in  a  brief
    appearance. He has not seen the appellant or his son  since  then.  The
    appellant asked him to assist with the appeal hearing but did not  hear
    anything further from him. The appellant has heard  and  believes  that
    the father is not working and is suffering  repeated  ill-health  after
    years of heavy drinking. The appellant's daughter saw him although  not
    to speak to and her evidence was that he appeared to be  in  very  poor
    health and having difficulties walking.

21.      I find that the appellant is the primary carer  for  her  son.  His
    father has never had any responsibility for his care. I find  that  his
    lack of contact, lack of  interest,  drinking  habits,  long-term  ill-
    health and unemployment means that he would be neither willing nor able
    to look after his son if the appellant  was  removed  from  the  UK.  I
    accept that the elder daughter would, as she said in her  evidence,  be
    unable to look after him. The younger 17-year-old daughter was not even
    asked whether she could do so and I find that she could not.  The  only
    other possible candidate, suggested by Mr  Melvin,  is  the  daughter's
    grandmother who is not a blood relative of the son. She spends part  of
    her time in this country in part in the USA.  The  evidence  falls  far
    short of establishing that there is any possibility of her being either
    willing or able to look after him. I find that the  son  is  a  British
    citizen and an EEA national. He is under 18 years of age.

22.      I find that to the standard of the  balance  of  probabilities  the
    appellant has established that she meets the requirements of Regulation
    15A of the 2006 Regulations.

23.      I find that in the light of JM and Ahmed  Article  8  human  rights
    grounds can be considered, as Mr Chipperfield submits.  However,  as  I
    have allowed the appeal under the 2006 Regulations I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

24.      Whilst I have not been asked  to  make  an  anonymity  direction  I
    consider that such a direction is appropriate and necessary to  protect
    the interests of the son and the appellant's daughters. I make an order
    under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    prohibiting the disclosure or publication of any matter likely to  lead
    members of the public to identify the appellant or any  member  of  her
    family.

25.      The decision of the  FTTJ  having  been  set  aside  I  remake  the
    decision and allow the appellant's appeal under the 2006 Regulations.



    .............................................
    Signed        Date 7 January 2015


    Upper Tribunal Judge Moulden



                                 Appendix A

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 2 November 1978. She  has
    been  given  permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  First-Tier
    Tribunal Judge Kaler ("the FTTJ") who dismissed her appeal against  the
    respondent's decision of 19 December 2013 to  refuse  to  grant  her  a
    derivative residence card as the primary carer of a British child under
    the provisions of Regulation 15A of the Immigration (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").  The  application  was
    considered on the basis of the appellant's claim that she was  a  third
    country national upon whom a  British  citizen  was  dependent  in  the
    United Kingdom in line with the ECJ judgment in Ruiz Zambrano (C34/09).

 2. The respondent took the view that the  appellant  had  not  established
    that her son, K, who was born on 31 December 2008, would be  unable  to
    remain in the UK if she was forced  to  leave.  She  had  not  provided
    evidence as to why his father would not be in a position  to  care  for
    him.

 3. The appellant appealed and the FTTJ heard her appeal on 14 August 2014.
    Both parties were represented. The appellant gave evidence, as did  one
    of her daughters. The FTTJ dismissed the appeal  both  under  the  2006
    Regulations and on Article 8 human rights grounds. She found  that;  "I
    am not satisfied on the evidence  before  me  that  the  father  is  an
    unsuitable person to look after K and so K could  therefore  live  with
    the father in the UK. K would not be required to leave the  country  if
    the  appellant  were  removed."  The  appellant  was  not  entitled  to
    derivative right of residence under the 2006 Regulations as  there  was
    another parent who could look after K.

 4. The appellant applied for and was granted permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal. It was submitted that the FTTJ made an  error  of  fact
    which either was so important that it amounted to an error of  law,  or
    else gave rise to an error of law in that the misunderstanding  of  the
    appellant's evidence was taken into account by the FTTJ in reaching the
    conclusion that there were inconsistencies between the appellant's oral
    and written evidence as to whether she had lived with  K's  father  and
    whether they were living together when he was born. The  first,  second
    and third grounds address differing aspects of this alleged error.  The
    grounds also argue that the FTTJ  erred  in  the  conclusion  that  the
    appellant's circumstances were not exceptional so as to merit Article 8
    consideration outside the Immigration Rules and  failed  to  take  into
    account the interests of the appellant's two daughters.

 5. Mr Osadebe relied on and developed the grounds of appeal  by  reference
    to the appellant's bundle of documents which was before the FTTJ.

 6. Ms Kenny submitted that there was no error of law. If there was, it was
    not material. She argued that the fact that K's  birth  was  originally
    registered with no father named, but subsequently re-registered by both
    parents specifically in order to include the father's name on the birth
    certificate, indicated that the father was more involved in  his  son's
    life than the appellant had suggested.

 7. Mr Osadebe asked us to find that there was an error of law,  set  aside
    the decision and remake it without preserving any of  the  findings  of
    fact. We reserved our determination.

 8. We find that the FTTJ made an important error of fact amounting to,  or
    at the very least giving rise to an error of law. In  paragraph  9  she
    said; "The appellant stated at the hearing that  she  had  never  lived
    with K's father. However she said in her statement that they  did  live
    together for two years before they married  (paragraph  17).  It  would
    therefore seem that they lived together when K was born. They  probably
    parted shortly afterwards, as  the  parents'  addresses  on  the  birth
    certificate are different. I accept that they have not  lived  together
    for several years."

 9. This conclusion arises from a misreading  of  the  appellant's  witness
    statement. In paragraph 17 the appellant said that whilst living in the
    UK she met a named French national (AM). They lived  together  for  two
    years and then married in a church in Camberwell in 2010 (i.e.  when  K
    was around 2 years old). The marriage  broke  up  and  they  separated.
    However, in paragraph 16 the appellant  said  that  K's  father  was  a
    British citizen and in paragraph 21 that K was also a British  citizen.
    Throughout K is referred to with the family name M, which is  the  same
    as the name of his father given on his  birth  certificate.  We  accept
    that the birth certificate  issued  on  re-registration  raises  issues
    which also need to be considered when compared with the original  birth
    certificate.

10. Whilst the  appellant's  witness  statement  perhaps  could  have  been
    clearer, we find that the appellant was not saying that  AM,  a  French
    national, was K's father. In any event, as K  was  born  in  2008,  the
    FTTJ's findings that the couple parted shortly after his birth  (having
    lived together previously) make no sense if she mistakenly believed the
    appellant to have been referring to AM as K's father in paragraph 17  -
    the appellant and AM lived together for two years after K's  birth  and
    before they were married. The FTTJ has somehow muddled up the evidence.
    The appellant's witness statement is not  inconsistent  with  her  oral
    evidence. The appellant was consistent in her evidence that M  was  the
    father of K and that they had never lived together.

11. We find that this is an important error of fact which impinges both  on
    the central issue in the appeal and on the question of the  appellant's
    credibility. The conclusion that the appellant had  given  inconsistent
    evidence is likely to have informed  the  FTTJ's  conclusion  that  the
    appellant had failed to show that K's father could not look  after  him
    if she had to leave the country. We cannot assume that she  would  have
    reached the same conclusion if she had not fallen into  error  on  this
    point. The finding that K's parents had lived together  for  some  time
    before he was born, and parted shortly after the birth  might  indicate
    that the nature of the relationship was more durable than the appellant
    had suggested in her evidence, and an inference  could  be  drawn  from
    this that M would be more likely to take an interest in  the  child  of
    the relationship. Both that, and  the  supposed  inconsistency  in  the
    appellant's evidence are likely to have had a  significant  bearing  on
    the FTTJ's rejection of the appellant's claim that M had little  to  do
    with K and her finding that he has had "meaningful  contact"  with  his
    father and continues to do so.

12. There is in terms no clear conclusion as to whether the appellant is or
    is not a credible witness. However the muddled findings in paragraph  9
    may have influenced the FTTJ in finding  inconsistencies  elsewhere  in
    her evidence that we find difficult to discern.

13. Whilst it is not raised in the grounds of appeal, we cannot see why the
    FTTJ reached the conclusion  that  she  did  in  paragraph  10  of  the
    determination that the appellant had been inconsistent about the amount
    of contact that K's father M had with  K.  It  is  not  clear  why  the
    appellant's evidence that his father "hardly ever sees" K and certainly
    does not make any financial contribution towards his upkeep is  alleged
    to be inconsistent with her evidence that he does "sometimes" telephone
    her (that is, the appellant), and that she and M may have  met  up  and
    talked "on a few occasions" whilst K was present. Taken  together  with
    the evidence there was one recent birthday party for K at the  father's
    house, and that the father made arrangements with the appellant to  see
    K but then did not always turn up, it is not obvious  to  us  that  the
    appellant's evidence  about  the  extent  of  M's  contact  with  K  is
    inconsistent. The FTTJ's reasoning is not assisted  by  the  apparently
    self-contradictory conclusion  in  the  paragraph  11  that  there  was
    "regular intermittent" contact between K and his father. One would  not
    usually refer to intermittent (i.e.  sporadic)  contact  as  "regular",
    unless perhaps as an obscure way of describing contact  once  or  twice
    every year but on regular occasions, say, Christmas and on the  child's
    birthday. It does not appear that this is what the FTTJ  had  in  mind,
    and in any event the evidence does not bear that interpretation.

14. We find that there is an error of fact which amounts to an error of law
    and that it is material. The FTTJ might well have reached  a  different
    conclusion but for the mistake.

15. The FTTJ did not make an anonymity direction. Whilst we have  not  been
    asked to do so we consider that it  is  appropriate  and  necessary  to
    protect the interests of K and the appellant's other children. We  make
    an order under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of any matter likely  to
    lead members of the public to identify the appellants or any member  of
    her family.

Decision

16. Having concluded that the FTTJ erred in law we set aside her  decision.
    The findings of fact are not preserved. There was insufficient time for
    us to re-hear the appeal with oral evidence. We direct that the  appeal
    be reheard in the Upper Tribunal.
