                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant, who was born  on  10  August  1983,  is  a  national  of
    Bangladesh. He first entered the United Kingdom on 13 August 2008  with
    permission to remain for just 13 days. He  did  not  leave  the  United
    Kingdom at the end of this period of time. He applied for permission to
    remain outside the Immigration  Rules  on  15  November  2010  but  his
    application was refused.

2.   He was encountered on 6 March 2014 and served with notice of  liability
    to removal and detention. A subsequent  human  rights  application  was
    refused and certified on 11 April 2014.  It was not possible to  remove
    him from the United Kingdom on 16  September  2015  because  he  became
    disruptive and he applied for asylum on 17 September 2015.

3.   His application was refused on 4 May 2016 and  his  appeal  was  listed
    before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Obhi  on  21  February  2017.  She
    promulgated a decision on 2  March  2017  which  stated  that  she  had
    allowed the appeal under the Refugee Convention.

4.   On  29  June  2017  the  Appellant's  solicitors  wrote  to  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Obhi pointing out her decision  was  not  in  accordance
    with substance of her findings. She  then  promulgated  a  supplemental
    decision and reasons on 9 August 2017.  In this  decision,  she  stated
    that it  was  no  longer  possible  for  the  decision  to  be  amended
    administratively.  She  then  went  on  to  note  that  there   was   a
    typographical error  which  erroneously  stated  that  the  appeal  was
    allowed when in fact it is clear from the body of the decision that the
    appeal had been dismissed. She also confirmed that the appeal had  been
    dismissed.

5.   On 22  August  2017,  the  Appellant  appealed  against  the  decision,
    promulgated on 2 March 2017, and also sought an extension of time to do
    so. First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin refused him permission to  appeal
    on 1 November 2017.

6.   The Appellant renewed his application for permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal on 13 November  2017  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grubb
    granted him permission to appeal on 15  December  2017  on  one  ground
    only. This was that, following Katsonga  ("Slip  Rule";  FtT's  general
    powers) [2016] UKUT 228 (IAC), First-tier Tribunal Judge  Obhi  had  no
    jurisdiction to issue a supplemental decision  correcting  her  earlier
    decision. This appears to have been  in  response  to  the  Appellant's
    submission that the replacement of the decision promulgated on 2  March
    2017 with the one promulgated on 9 August 2017 was ultra vires.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING

7.   Both the Appellant's solicitor and the Home Office  Presenting  Officer
    made very brief oral submissions and I have referred to the content  of
    these submissions, where relevant, in my decision below.





ERROR OF LAW DECISION

8.   In her decision promulgated on 2 March 2017, First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Obhi clearly stated at paragraph 46  of  her  decision  that  "for  the
    reasons I have given I dismiss the appeal under the refugee  convention
    and under human rights". However, under the heading, Decision, she then
    wrote "the appeal  of  the  appellant  is  allowed  under  the  refugee
    convention".

9.   When this was brought to  the  Judge's  attention  by  the  Appellant's
    solicitor,  she  promulgated  an  amended  decision,   dismissing   the
    Appellant's appeal, on 9 August 2017. The Appellant then  purported  to
    appeal against the decision promulgated on 2 March 2017, as amended  by
    the supplementary decision promulgated on 9 August 2017.

10.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin extended time to appeal  against  the
    earlier decision on on the basis that the delay arose  because  of  the
    error previously made by First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi.

11.  But, at 9 August 2017, the relevant slip rule  was  contained  in  Rule
    31of  the  Tribunal  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and   Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014, which came into  force  on  20  October  2014  and
    stated that:
         "Clerical mistakes and accidental slips or omissions
         31.  The Tribunal may at any time correct any clerical  mistake  or
         other accidental slip or omission in a decision, direction  or  any
         document produced by it, by-  (a)  providing  notification  of  the
         amended decision or direction, or a copy of the  amended  document,
         to all parties; and (b)  making  any  necessary  amendment  to  any
         information published in relation to  the  decision,  direction  or
         document".

12.  It would appear that First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi believed  that  she
    could  use  this  rule  to  deal  with  what  she  referred  to  as   a
    typographical error. However, in Katsonga, which was reported on 18 May
    2016, Upper Tribunal Judge Ockleton found that:
         "1.  The 'Slip Rule', rule 31 of the First-tier Tribunal  Procedure
             Rules, cannot be used to reverse the effect of a decision".

13.  Therefore, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Obhi  had  no  jurisdiction  to
    "amend" her initial decision and  her  attempt  to  amend  her  earlier
    decision  was  ineffective.  Therefore,  she  erred  in  law  when  she
    promulgated her supplementary decision.

14.  As a consequence, the only decision which is still  in  place  is  that
    allowing the Appellant's appeal. This decision was  appealable  by  the
    Respondent on  the  basis  that  the  decision  reached  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Obhi was not supported by her findings of  fact  but  no
    such appeal has been made.  Therefore, there is no basis upon which the
    Upper Tribunal can make a further decision or remit  the  case  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a re-hearing.

DECISION

(1)  The Appellant's appeal is allowed on the limited basis that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Obhi  had  no  jurisdiction  to  make  her  supplemental
    decision, promulgated on 9 August 2017.

DIRECTIONS

1.   If the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  wishes  to  appeal
    against the decision, promulgated on 2 March 2017,  she  must  make  an
    application to extend time to do so and submit appropriate grounds.

2.   No decision to remove the Appellant from the United Kingdom  should  be
    made pending a decision on any such application, any decision to extend
    time, any further decision on any appeal or any decision not to  appeal
    against the decision, promulgated on 2 March 2017.
