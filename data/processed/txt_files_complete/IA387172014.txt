                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


         Decision on Appellant's application to withdraw his appeal

1.    On 7 May 2015, the Appellant was granted permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

2.     By  a  letter  dated  14  September  2015,   Visa   Inn   Immigration
    Specialists,  the  Appellant's  representatives,  informed  the   Upper
    Tribunal that the Appellant had instructed them to withdraw his appeal.
     I have decided to treat this as an application  by  the  Appellant  to
    withdraw his case, given that the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (the "UT Rules") do  not  make  provision  for  a  party  to
    withdraw its appeal.

3.    Rule 17(1) and (2) of the Upper Tribunal Rules provides  for  a  party
    to withdraw its case before the Upper Tribunal, with the consent of the
    Tribunal.

4.    The Upper Tribunal hereby consents to the withdrawal by the  Appellant
    of his case.

5.    This means that the Respondent's case before the  Upper  Tribunal  (as
    set out in the Reply dated 22 May 2015) is unopposed. Accordingly,  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal stands and the appeal  of  the
    Appellant to the Upper Tribunal dismissed.

6.    The hearing on 17 September 2015 will therefore be vacated.
