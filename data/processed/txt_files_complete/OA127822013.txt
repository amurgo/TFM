Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Unigwe, Counsel, instructed by Melvyn Everson &
Co


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   In this determination the Respondent is hereafter referred  to  as  the
    claimant and the ECO is referred to as  the  ECO  rather  than  as  the
    Appellant.
2.   The claimant, a national for Sierra Leone, date of  birth  15  November
    1996, appealed against the decision of  the  ECO,  dated  2  May  2013,
    refusing leave to  enter  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  appeal
    against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid on 30
    April 2014 and in a determination promulgated on 6 May 2014  the  judge
    allowed the appeal seemingly under  the  Immigration  Rules,  paragraph
    297, and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

3.   Permission to appeal that decision was given to the ECO  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Holmes on 13 June 2014 on the basis that it was arguable
    that the  judge had failed to provide  adequate  reasons  for  whatever
    decision he had made on the issues that were in dispute and that it was
    unclear  whether  the  appeal  was  allowed  or  dismissed  under   the
    Immigration Rules or merely allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.   First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Holmes  correctly  identified  that  there  was  no
    adequate assessment of proportionality of the refusal in the  light  of
    the (unspecified) failure to meet the requirements of the Rules.

4.   The ECO's decision had proceeded with reference to paragraph  297(1)(e)
    of  the  Immigration  Rules  (the  Rules)  on  the  basis   that   sole
    responsibility had not been established.  The evidence provided by  the
    Appellant's mother and Miss Lardner essential addressed  the  issue  of
    "sole responsibility" and  really  did  not  in  the  written  evidence
    address whether or not there were  serious  and  compelling  family  or
    other  considerations  which  made  the  exclusion  of  the   Appellant
    undesirable.

5.   The representations made by a Miss Ukachi-Lois may for their part  have
    been entirely coherent in addressing both paragraph 297(1)(e)  and  (f)
    but if so, unfortunately those  do  not  translate  into  the  way  the
    decision was set out.  As Mr Unigwe  entirely  correctly  accepts,  the
    determination ultimately makes no findings whatsoever on the  claim  in
    relation to sole responsibility and without  making  reference  to  the
    wording of subparagraph (f) simply refers to  the  Appellant  being  in
    desperate need of his mother's and other people's  care,  whoever  they
    may be, and to the Appellant being in serious need of   help  from  the
    UK.  The uncle , Eustace bako Johnson's statement which is not  in  any
    part, recited by the judge is contained within a statutory declaration,
    dated 20 February 2013. It simply indicates in brief that  he,  because
    of his travelling arrangements, was not in a position  to  provide  the
    kind of support that a 17� year old child would require.

6.   The statement of the  appellant's  mother,  Hillina  Lardner  similarly
    does not address matters in terms of there  being  either  a  desperate
    need nor serious need.  Although self- evidently she would wish  to  be
    joined in the UK, where she has indefinite leave to remain, by her son.
     One cannot have anything other than sympathy for Mrs Lardner in having
    gone through that process and no  doubt  complied  with  those  matters
    advised by her representatives, that she attends today to hear  of  the
    significant deficiencies in the determination of the judge.

7.   It  is  clear  law  from  the  cases  of  ER  [2004]  QB  1044  CA  and
    R(Iran)[2005] EWCA982 that the parties to an  appeal  are  entitled  to
    proper, sufficient or adequate reasons. Unfortunately the determination
    is bereft of an adequate explanation of reasons.  Albeit as  Mr  Unigwe
    rightly maintains, the judge at least made some findings but one cannot
    determine exactly what they were and how they were arrived at.

8.   Accordingly I find that  the  judge  gave  no  adequate  or  sufficient
    reasons for the finding that the  Appellant  could  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  This is not to say he might not be able  to  do  so
    but on the face of it I cannot tell whether or not that  was  a  likely
    prospect.

9.   Similar the judge having recited the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  and
    various other cases simply says this:

         "25.  Applying the Razgar test, one cannot  escape  the  conclusion
             that the Appellant is in  a  familiar  relationship.   'Family
             life' is interfered with in such a serious manner that Article
             8 is engaged. One cannot see  that  preventing  the  Appellant
             from entering this country to join his mother will  serve  the
             attainment of any legitimate goal. Therefore refusal of  leave
             to the Appellant to enter this country is disproportionate and
             contrary to the spirit of ECHR protections."

10.  Apart from the conflation of  elements  of  Razgar,  the  fact  of  the
    matter is the judge gives no explanation as to the significance of  the
    interference, assuming as I do the re-establishment of a family life is
    an aspect of Article 8 of the ECHR.  Rather, the judge simply fails  to
    address whether the issue of interference is in accordance with the law
    or whether it is necessary in a democratic society  to  do  so,  having
    regard to the way the fourth question is posed  in  Razgar.   Similarly
    there is simply a completely inadequate explanation  by  the  judge  in
    relation to proportionality and the factors to be taken  into  account,
    not least the public interest, irrespective of the Secretary of State's
    own views of these matters.

11.  In the circumstances therefore the  finding  in  paragraph  29  of  the
    determination

         "I am fully conscious of the 'legal requirements' stipulated by the
         Immigration Rules.  What came through from the  oral  evidence  and
         the documents was the fact that this Appellant is in desperate need
         of  his mother's and other people's care. Naturally  the  affidavit
         of his father's brother dated 20 February 2013  supports  the  idea
         that he is in serious need of help from the UK."

12.  It is troubling that there is  no such explanation or  reasoning  of  a
    serious need of  help from the United Kingdom.  Be that as it may I  do
    not find that is properly  an  explanation  of  either  the  appeal  in
    relation to sole responsibility under the Rules or in relation  to  the
    necessary  compelling  circumstances  arising  for  family   or   other
    considerations under paragraph 297(1)(f) of the Rules.

13.  Thus the finding,  if  it  can  be  called  that,  without  reasons  in
    paragraph 30 does not take the matter anywhere.  I  find  the  original
    Tribunal made errors of law and the original Tribunal's decision cannot
    stand.

14.  Having heard submissions from the parties I am satisfied that  this  is
    an appropriate case,  since  there  is  no  adequate  decision  and  no
    adequate findings of fact, to return to the First-tier Tribunal for  it
    to be remade again.

    (5)  No interpreter required.
