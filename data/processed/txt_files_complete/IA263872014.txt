Officer

Hartigan


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is  an  application  by  the  Secretary  of  State  challenging  a
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Sills,  promulgated  on  28
    August 2015 following a hearing at Sheldon Court in  Birmingham  on  30
    July 2015, in which the judge allowed the appellant's appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules,  thereafter  stating  that  there  was  no  need  to
    consider the matter as a freestanding Article 8 ECHR claim.

2.   The evidence before the judge was set out in  the  determination.   The
    relevant Immigration Rules are set out at paragraphs 13 to 15 inclusive
    and it is not suggested that in setting out those Rules the  judge  has
    misdirected himself in law in terms of the wording.   It  is  suggested
    before me today on behalf of the Secretary of State that the  judge  in
    fact  misdirected  himself  by  failing  to   properly   consider   the
    requirements of E-LTRP.2.2., which states that the applicant  must  not
    be in the UK in breach of immigration laws (disregarding any period  of
    overstaying for a period of 28 days or  less)  unless  paragraph  EX.1.
    applies.

3.   The grounds on which the Secretary of State  sought  to  challenge  the
    decision contains a statement in the first paragraph that  in  drafting
    the grounds the author had not had access to any  appeal  documentation
    save for that which is accessible via the Home Office computer systems.
     That may be the case and it is noted that this is a Birmingham  appeal
    in which the appellant's bundle would have been served upon the PO Unit
    based at Solihull in the West  Midlands,  whereas  the  author  of  the
    grounds is a Mr Kingham  based  at  the  Presenting  Officers  Unit  in
    Newcastle upon Tyne.  That being so, there is an  obligation  upon  any
    party to proceedings to ensure that if they are going to make a  claim,
    unless faced with an urgent situation such as the imminent expiry of  a
    limitation period, they try and acquire and equip  themselves  with  as
    much information as possible to ascertain whether there may be at least
    arguable merit in the grounds on which they are  submitting  the  judge
    has erred.

4.   Paragraph 1 of the  grounds  of  challenge  contains  the  single  word
    misdirection.  It does not say what the nature of that misdirection is,
    whether it is in relation to law or fact, and before the Tribunal today
    Ms Willocks-Briscoe  has  stated  it  is  in  fact  both.   The  ground
    specifically refers to paragraph 16 of the determination and state:

         "Paragraph 16 recounts that the respondent's  case  was  considered
         under Appendix FM.  The refusal letter on the computer system which
         accompanied the  notice  of  decision  is  solely  a  consideration
         outside  the  Rules.   This  is  because  the  appellant's  claimed
         partner, Ms Grojdova, is a Czech national and is not settled in the
         United Kingdom.  In addition  there  is  no  apparent  evidence  to
         support  the  contention  recorded  at  paragraph   25   that   the
         appellant's child to that lady is a British  citizen.   Accordingly
         the judge's consideration under  Appendix  FM  started  off  on  an
         incorrect footing.  The Appellant cannot succeed under Appendix  FM
         even if EX.1. is in his favour  on  the  basis  that  he  fails  E-
         LTRP.1.2.  Accordingly there is no route to EX.1. following Sabir".


5.   Two issues arise.  The first is that the  challenge  to  the  decision,
    based upon the findings in relation to the status of  the  partner  and
    the child, is clearly wrong in fact and law.  The bundle  sent  to  the
    Secretary of State in relation to the appeal process  contained  within
    it at page 15 a copy of a grant of indefinite leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom outside  the  Immigration  Rules  dated  28  June  2004,
    clearly showing that a considerable period of time prior  to  date  the
    application was made the Secretary of State had granted settled  status
    to the appellant's partner.  The second document appearing at  page  13
    of the bundle is a copy of the Czech passport but there is  information
    at page 18 of  the  bundle  showing,  in  fact,  the  child's  passport
    confirming a grant  of  United  Kingdom  citizenship  upon  the  child.
    Again, that appears at page 18 to be the child and at page 13 to be the
    partner's previous Czech passport.

6.   In summary, the statement that the Czech national  is  not  settled  is
    factually  incorrect.   The  statement  that  the  child  born  to  the
    appellant and his partner is not a British citizen, although  there  is
    no evidence to that effect, is again factually incorrect.  It  was  not
    raised before the First-tier Tribunal and was not raised in the grounds
    of challenge that the judge erred in  law  in  considering  EX.1.   The
    statement is that there was no route to EX.1. if the basis  of  refusal
    was under E-LTRP.1.2. but it has been shown on the  information  before
    the Tribunal that the appellant had discharged the burden of proof upon
    him to the required standard to show that those requirements  could  be
    satisfied.

7.   Ms Willocks-Briscoe introduced  a  new  matter  today,  which  was  not
    pleaded in this form earlier, namely that the issue was not E-LTRP.1.2.
    but E-LTRP.2.2., and argues that as the appellant had no leave to be in
    the United Kingdom or had overstayed for a period of 28 days EX.1.  did
    not apply.  If one looks at E-LTRP.2.2. even if a person is  in  breach
    that is not necessarily a bar to them succeeding if EX.1. applies.   No
    misdirection of law has been made out in the judge considering EX.1. on
    the basis of the evidence that was  before  him  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing.

8.   The correct version of  EX.1.  is  set  out  at  paragraph  14  of  the
    determination.  The various requirements to succeed in  relation  to  a
    person with a parental relationship with a child are set out  at  (aa),
    (cc) and (ii).  The issue which has occupied us today  is  whether  the
    judge was right to find it was not reasonable to expect  the  child  to
    leave the United Kingdom and I will come on to that below.

9.   I will make the following general observations at this point which  are
    twofold, firstly the  determination  clearly  shows  that  although  Ms
    Childs of Counsel appeared on behalf of the appellant at  that  hearing
    there was no appearance and no representative sent along to the  First-
    tier Tribunal by the Secretary of State.  I am, however, satisfied that
    the Secretary of State was fully seized of the information available to
    the Tribunal as a result of the service of the appeal bundle.

10.  The second point is that the removal direction that had  been  produced
    and attached to the  impugned  decision,  the  refusal  letter,  was  a
    removal direction set to Afghanistan.  There is  no  reference  in  the
    refusal letter to the option  of  viable  internal  relocation  if  the
    appellant  was  unable  to  return  to  his  home  area.  It  has  been
    established in relation to the  law  and  practice  vis-�-vis  internal
    relocation that the starting point in an internal relocation  case  has
    to be that  the  Secretary  of  State  raises  the  issue  of  internal
    relocation  either  in  the  refusal  letter  or  at  the  hearing   if
    appropriate which the judge will deal with subject to the  doctrine  of
    fairness.  In relation to the factors raised at the hearing it may be a
    matter which the appellant needs more time to prepare to argue  against
    if they became a live issue.

11.  The challenge before the judge was to a refusal of an  application  for
    leave and a removal direction dated 26 June 2014 to  Afghanistan.   The
    judge found that it would not be reasonable to expect  the  appellant's
    son to move to Afghanistan with the appellant, at paragraph 26  of  the
    determination, which is a preserved finding.

12.  The judge did consider in paragraph 25 the following:

         "As the appellant's child is a British citizen the  next  issue  is
         whether it would be reasonable to expect the appellant's  child  to
         leave the  UK.   The  answer  to  this  question  is  unequivocally
         contained in the respondent's own policy document as set out above.
          According to the policy, the appellant's case must be  based  upon
         the premise that it would be unreasonable to expect  his  child  to
         leave the EU, hence in this case also the UK.  Case law  relied  on
         by the appellant, such as Sanade and  others  (British  children  -
         Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 48 confirms this principle.  Hence I
         find that it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the  appellant's
         child to relocate to Afghanistan."


    As stated, there is no challenge to that statement vis-�-vis the  child
    or the partner going to Afghanistan, which is a  finding  open  to  the
    judge on the basis of the available evidence.


13.  In relation to paragraph 25 there  is  arguably  some  confusion  there
    because the issue in Sanade, Zambrano and Dereci was that it  would  be
    unlawful to remove a child from the territorial boundaries of  the  EU,
    hence depriving them of rights deriving from their status  as  European
    citizens, which if removed from the UK  to  the  Czech  Republic  would
    obviously mean the child was still within the borders of the  EU.   The
    Rules, EX.1.(ii), do not focus on the  EU  issue,  they  focus  on  the
    question of whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave
    the UK although the question of 'to where?' is a relevant factor.

14.  It has been argued by  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  that  notwithstanding  the
    absence of any issue relating  to  relocation  to  the  Czech  Republic
    having been raised  in  the  refusal  letter  and  notwithstanding  the
    failure to provide a Presenting Officer to  put  an  argument  to  that
    effect to the judge, i.e. this was an element of which  the  judge  was
    completely unaware, the judge should of his own motion have  considered
    whether the fact that the child could settle within the  boundaries  of
    the EU on the basis of a preserved  right  as  an  EU  national  was  a
    Robinson obvious point which the judge should have considered and taken
    into account and by implication  found  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    favour.

15.  Proceedings before these Tribunals are adversarial  by  nature  as  has
    been confirmed by the Court of Appeal on many occasions including those
    relating to European principles.  The judge was entitled to look at the
    issue before him notwithstanding the fact that the evidence that led to
    the decision letter, it is suggested, was different to that upon  which
    the judge made his findings.  The judge was still entitled to take as a
    starting point the Secretary of State's position  as  set  out  in  the
    documents.

16.  The test the judge had to consider was whether it would  be  reasonable
    to expect the child to leave the UK and in this respect  Ms  Childs  is
    right in her submissions to refer to the evidence that was  before  the
    judge which focused specifically on this point.  The child is a British
    citizen, the child's contacts and friends are in  the  United  Kingdom,
    the child has been in the UK for at least  seven  years  or  more  than
    seven years and the judge had before him a report from  an  independent
    social worker  that  examined  in  detail  the  child's  situation  and
    commented specifically upon whether it would be  in  the  child's  best
    interests for the child to leave the United Kingdom.  The  judge  found
    when considering the combination of those factors that it would not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.

17.  That is the task the judge was required to undertake  when  looking  at
    the relevant Immigration Rules under EX.1. and that is the  task  which
    the judge did undertake.  It is not a case where it can  be  said  that
    the judge has erred in law in not effectively going on and  doing  what
    is suggested the judge should have  done,  i.e.  without  a  Presenting
    Officer, having  done  the  Secretary  of  State's  job  for  her,  and
    considered a matter which was not obvious, was  not  raised  or  relied
    upon and which does not impact upon the key issue of the  child's  life
    in the United Kingdom.  I do not find it has been  established  on  the
    basis of the submissions made or grounds of claim  that  there  is  any
    arguable legal error material to the decision to allow the appeal under
    the Immigration Rules made out in relation to  this  matter.   On  that
    basis the Secretary of State's challenge is dismissed.

18.  In relation to the application for a wasted  costs  order  against  the
    Secretary of State submissions have been made by both parties.   It  is
    not disputed that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make such an  order.
    Section 29 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  is  the
    relevant statutory provision  and  particularly  Section  29(4),  which
    allows  a  Tribunal  to  make  an  order  that  the  legal   or   other
    representative concerned must meet the whole of  any  wasted  costs  or
    such part of them as may be determined in accordance with the  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules.  The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    therefore have to be looked at as those Rules relate to  the  power  of
    the Upper Tribunal to make an award of costs and  also  the  limitation
    upon the Tribunal's ability to exercise that power.  Rule  10(3)(c)  is
    the relevant Rule which provides that the Upper  Tribunal  can  make  a
    costs award in relation to  wasted  costs  under  the  power  found  in
    Section 29(4) of the 2007 Act.

19.  When considering whether an order for costs  should  be  made  guidance
    has been provided by the Court of Appeal and the Tribunal itself.   The
    relevant decision of the Tribunal is that of Cancino [2015]  UKFTT  59,
    which, although a decision of the First-tier Tribunal, was heard by the
    President of both the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunals.  The
    President at paragraph 13 of that  decision  referred  to  the  leading
    authority on wasted costs which is the decision of the Court of  Appeal
    in Ridehalgh v Horsefield [1994] Ch 205 which emphasised  firstly  that
    the jurisdiction to make a  wasted  costs  order  is  directed  at  the
    representatives of a party and as per Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of
    the Rolls, at paragraph 239(e) that even if the court is satisfied that
    a  legal  representative  has   acted   improperly,   unreasonably   or
    negligently and such conduct has caused the  other  side  to  incur  an
    identifiable sum of wasted costs it is not bound to make the order  but
    that in that situation it would of  course  have  to  give  sustainable
    reasons for exercising its discretion against making an order.

20.  That paragraph is important as it refers to the three  potential  heads
    of conduct that  need  to  be  considered.   The  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Ridehalgh emphasised a three stage test being as follows:

    (a)  Has the legal representative  of  whom  complaint  is  made  acted
         improperly, unreasonably or negligently?


    (b)  If so, did such conduct cause the applicant to  incur  unnecessary
         costs?


    (c)  If so, is it in all the circumstances of the case  just  to  order
         the legal representative to compensate the applicant for the  whole
         or any part of the relevant costs,


    and that there must be a causal nexus between the conduct complained of
    and the wasted costs claimed.


21.  In relation to those and other matters I find the  Secretary  of  State
    has been put on notice of this  application.   In  the  grounds  it  is
    stated that a wasted costs order would be sought.  Secondly that if  it
    is found that the Secretary of State has acted improperly, unreasonably
    or negligently that the causal nexus between such conduct and Ms Childs
    having to come along today  to  defend  the  challenges  is  made  out.
    Whether the whole or part of the related  costs  are  applicable  is  a
    matter that I shall come on to in a moment.

22.  In relation to the three  heads,  that  of  improper,  unreasonable  or
    negligently it is not suggested that the  author  of  the  grounds  has
    acted negligently or in fact has acted unreasonably in the  sense  that
    unreasonableness is defined by the Court of Appeal in  Ridehalgh.   The
    issue in this case is whether the  author  of  the  grounds  has  acted
    improperly.  In  terms  of  the  definition  of  this  term,  this  was
    described by the Court of Appeal as covering not only aspects  confined
    to conduct which  would  ordinarily  be  held  to  justify  disbarment,
    striking off, suspension from practice or  other  serious  professional
    penalty, none of which would be applicable on the facts of this matter,
    but it would cover any significant breach of a substantial duty imposed
    by a relevant code of professional conduct but was not limited to that.
     Conduct which could be regarded as improper according to the consensus
    of professional including judicial opinion would be fairly  stigmatised
    as such whether or not it violated the letter of a professional code.

23.  It is important to appreciate at this stage that whereas  a  member  of
    the Bar  or  the  Solicitors'  profession  is  governed  by  a  written
    professional code  of  conduct  it  has  not  been  shown  Home  Office
    Presenting Officers are bound  by  such  a  code,  although  as  public
    servants they are bound by expectations in relation to their conduct in
    relation to proceedings, which does impose an obligation upon  them  to
    act in a similar manner when conducting litigation.

24.  The crux of this matter is  that  the  grounds  seeking  permission  to
    appeal are patently wrong.  It is stated that  there  was  no  evidence
    that the partner, a Czech national, is settled in  the  United  Kingdom
    and it is stated there was no evidence to support the  contention  that
    the child is a British citizen.  That information was set out in clear,
    legible form in the  appeal  bundle  that  had  been  served  upon  the
    Secretary of State's representative.  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  has  stated
    today that she does not have  access  to  the  case  management  system
    showing whether it is recorded that such  a  bundle  was  received  and
    when. Being very fair to her, in her  submissions  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe
    also accepted that such would not always be recorded.  For the purposes
    of this matter it has to be accepted that that a bundle was  served  as
    indeed it was  served  upon  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   There  is  no
    evidence to the contrary to suggest or support a finding otherwise.

25.  As stated in the substantive decision, the Secretary  of  State  failed
    to provide a representative to attend the hearing before the First-tier
    Tribunal, so it is not known whether a representative of the  Secretary
    of State even bothered  reading  the  bundle  as  would  have  occurred
    possibly the day before the hearing when the allocated judge would have
    undertaken the required case preparation too.

26.  It is argued by Ms Childs  that  the  failure  of  the  author  of  the
    grounds was to interrogate the Secretary of State's own case management
    systems whereby he or she, he in this  case,  Mr  Kingham,  would  have
    discovered that in fact there had been a grant of ILR  to  the  partner
    and also the grant of British citizenship to the child.

27.  Ms Willocks-Briscoe in her submissions has  argued  that  there  is  no
    evidence of a link between  the  passport  service  database  and  that
    available to a Home Office Presenting Officer such that it  would  have
    been reasonable in the circumstances to have made that enquiry.  It  is
    suggested also that the author of the  grounds  could  not  necessarily
    have been expected to discover the grant of  status  in  light  of  the
    limited information  that  was  made  available  in  the  determination
    identifying the relevant parties.

28.  The definition of 'improper' set out by the Court of  Appeal  does  not
    include a breach of a substantial duty.  It must be both a  significant
    breach and a substantial duty.  The second part of that  is  made  out.
    There is a duty on any individual seeking to challenge  a  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to make sure that they are fully equipped  with
    the relevant facts.  Ms Childs  in  her  skeleton  argument  refers  at
    paragraph 19 to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Nixon (permission
    to appeal: grounds) [2014] UKUT 368 at paragraph 9 where the  President
    found there could be no substitute for properly tailored and  carefully
    crafted grounds of appeal  which  clearly  reflect  the  unique  facts,
    features and issues pertaining to the individual case.

29.  The question before me is: did the author of the grounds  significantly
    breach  the  duty  imposed  by  effectively  drafting  the  grounds  of
    challenge without being  aware  of  material  facts  and  circumstances
    appertaining to this case?  The author  of  the  grounds  sets  out  in
    paragraph 1: "In drafting the grounds I have  not  had  access  to  any
    appeal documentation save for that which is accessible via Home  Office
    computer systems."  The author of the grounds is therefore  recognising
    that  in  preparing  this  document  there  is  a  real  risk  or  real
    possibility that what is being set out might be patently wrong or  have
    no arguable merit.  The author of the grounds cannot know whether  what
    is written down has  merit  as  the  author  of  the  grounds  did  not
    undertake any further enquiries other than that recorded  on  the  Home
    Office computer systems.  What computer systems  were  checked  is  not
    clear for if a grant of indefinite leave to remain had been made  to  a
    named individual in 2004 there would have been a record of that on  the
    Home Office's own systems, but I accept the submission made in relation
    to the type of information that would have been required  to  allow  an
    accurate check of the system to be made.

30.  However, it is possible for a search of the Home Office database to  be
    made on information such as a name, a  surname  for  example,  and  the
    surname  of  the  appellant's  partner  is  clearly  set  out  in   the
    determination under challenge.  Searching that name may have given  the
    author of the grounds knowledge relating to the  grant  of  ELR  or  at
    least information which suggested that further enquiries were warranted
    or needed to be undertaken.

31.  This is not according to the pleadings an application that is  made  on
    grounds that have been submitted in an imperfect form as  a  result  of
    the pressure caused by the limitation date.  It appears to set out  the
    errors which the author seeks to rely upon, which have  been  shown  to
    have no arguable merit at all.

32.  Before the Tribunal  today  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  sought  to  introduce
    completely new grounds based upon a completely different  provision  of
    EX.1. and to argue the issue of jurisdiction and  the  ability  of  the
    judge to consider that clause, which is not mentioned  at  all  in  the
    original grounds.  When one looks at the conduct of  the  Secretary  of
    State in relation to this appeal process, failing to  attend,  although
    it is accepted that that is the norm in many  places  as  a  result  of
    operational restrictions  cost  restrictions  and  pressures  upon  the
    Presenting Officers Unit's, and  the  failure  of  the  author  of  the
    grounds to make sure that he was properly  appraised  of  the  relevant
    facts, I do find that it has been made out  that  in  relation  to  the
    drafting and  issuing  of  this  appeal  challenging  the  decision  in
    question that there has been a significant breach of a duty imposed  by
    conduct that would be regarded as improper according to  the  consensus
    of professional including judicial opinion.

33.  The Upper Tribunal have spent some time  recently  making  it  crystal-
    clear to those who issue challenges by way of permission to appeal that
    they must engage with the issues and any challenge must be based upon a
    proper analysis of whether they have realistic  arguable  prospects  of
    success.  Whilst a wasted costs order should not be made just because a
    case has little prospects of success or has been found to fail,  as  an
    individual has a right to challenge a decision if proper grounds exist,
    this is one of those cases where on the  facts  it  falls  outside  any
    general exclusion.   I find  Ms  Childs  has  established  that  it  is
    appropriate to make a wasted costs order in  relation  to  this  appeal
    which I make in the sum of her brief fee of attending  today  of  �350.
    The Secretary of State has fourteen days to make payment.

Notice of Decision

    The appeal is dismissed. No arguable legal error has been made out. The
    determination shall stand.

    The respondent shall pay the  appellants  wasted  cots  of  the  appeal
    summarily assessed in the sum of �350 with 14 days.

    No anonymity direction is made.
