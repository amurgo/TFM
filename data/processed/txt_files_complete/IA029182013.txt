                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the  appellant  against  a  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal issued on 3 July 2013 dismissing his appeal against
    the respondent's decision made on 8 January 2013 refusing  him  further
    leave to remain on human rights grounds.

Background

2.   The background to this appeal can briefly  be  summarised  as  follows.
    The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  2  January  1975.   He
    first entered the UK on 31 January 2006 with a  student  visa  and  was
    subsequently granted extensions until 31 July 2009.  In  November  2008
    the appellant and his future wife, the sponsor, made contact with  each
    other through a marriage website and  they  became  engaged  in  August
    2009.  They went through an Islamic ceremony of marriage on 18  October
    2009 and on 14 July 2010 they were married in a Registry office.

3.   On 27 July 2009 the appellant made an application for leave  to  remain
    but this was refused on 22 October 2009 because his college had closed.
     He appealed against this  decision  but  withdrew  his  appeal  on  14
    January 2010.  On 4 August 2010 he  made  further  submissions  to  the
    respondent.  These were accepted as an application for leave to  remain
    as  a  spouse  but  were  refused  on  17  September   2010.    Further
    representations were made and as  the  respondent  took  no  action  an
    application was lodged for judicial review on 24 July 2012.  The matter
    was settled by a consent order  on  30  October  2012,  the  respondent
    agreeing to make a decision within three months.

4.   The application was considered under the new Immigration Rules and  the
    decision was made on 8 January  2013  refusing  the  appellant  further
    leave and deciding to  remove  him.   The  respondent  found  that  the
    appellant could not meet the requirements of para 276ADE  and  was  not
    satisfied  that  there  were  exceptional  circumstances   sufficiently
    compelling to justify allowing him to remain in the UK.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  judge  heard
    evidence from both the appellant, the sponsor  and  his  sister-in-law.
    There was medical evidence about his wife's condition and  her  current
    medication and treatment.

6.   So far as the sponsor's immigration history  is  concerned,  the  judge
    noted that she came to the UK in 2001/2002.  Her mother remains  living
    in Pakistan.  She married after coming to the UK but it was  not  happy
    and broke down after two or three years.  She has settled in the UK and
    has brothers and sisters here.  She claimed  not  to  have  any  family
    living in Pakistan which she last visited after her mother's  death  in
    2009.

7.   The judge accepted that there was a genuine  relationship  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor.  She said that it had begun as something  of
    a business arrangement but she was satisfied that they had  grown  fond
    of one another and that the relationship  was  genuine  and  subsisting
    [31].  The marriage had taken place at  a  time  when  the  appellant's
    immigration situation was precarious and they went through the  Islamic
    ceremony of marriage when the appellant had an application for  further
    leave to remain as a student pending.  That application was refused but
    they went on to marry in  a  civil  ceremony  in  July  2010.   It  was
    accepted on the appellant's behalf that the appeal  could  not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules and that the appellant relied on article 8.

8.   The judge accepted that the sponsor would  not  leave  the  UK  if  the
    appellant was removed.  She found that her  current  medical  condition
    was stable and although she had  sought  to  persuade  the  judge  that
    without the appellant's support her medical condition would not be well-
    controlled and that it would be dangerous for her to be alone  in  case
    she suffered a fit, the judge was not satisfied on the evidence  before
    her that that was the case.  She found that the sponsor's epilepsy  was
    currently well-controlled and could be even better  controlled  in  the
    appellant's absence because she would not be trying to conceive.

9.   The judge said that the real issue was whether the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor should  be  allowed  to  circumvent  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules that are applied to everyone seeking spousal entry or
    leave to remain because of the amount of time the appellant  had  spent
    in the UK, the time the couple have  been  together,  their  dependency
    upon each other and the difficulties arising from the sponsor's medical
    problems [35].

10.  The judge accepted that article  8  was  engaged  both  in  respect  of
    family and private life for both the appellant and his wife.   However,
    they had entered into a relationship when the  appellant's  immigration
    status was precarious.   She  accepted  that  the  sponsor's  emotional
    dependence on the appellant was heavy but she believed that the account
    of her practical dependence upon the appellant  had  been  exaggerated.
    She commented that the appellant and sponsor had shown  a  blatant  and
    knowing disregard for  the  immigration  laws  of  the  UK  [38].   She
    accepted if the appellant were to return to Pakistan, there was a  real
    risk that the marriage would fail.  The judge said  in  [40]  that  the
    decision did not require the sponsor to  leave  the  UK  and  that  her
    private life was established before the appellant met her and  she  did
    not accept that the decision engaged her article 8 private life rights.
     The judge was not satisfied that the appellant had severed his  social
    or cultural ties to Pakistan where  his  family  still  lived  and  she
    commented that the appellant should not be  exempt  from  the  controls
    imposed on all of those seeking entry clearance as a spouse.

11.  The judge summarised her findings as follows:

         "43. Despite the impact upon the family unit in this  case  of  the
              appellant's  return  to  Pakistan,  I  have   come   to   the
              conclusion, albeit  reluctantly,  that  this  decision  is  a
              proportionate one.  The appellant and the sponsor  were  both
              adults when they chose to  start  a  relationship  and  later
              marry.  I am satisfied that it was apparent to both  of  them
              at all times that the appellant could not seek to  remain  in
              the United Kingdom under the rules but would have to rely  on
              the discretion of the Secretary of State and/or article 8  of
              the Human Rights Convention.   Nevertheless  they  sought  to
              cement their relationship and they have  been  trying  for  a
              family.


          44. The appellant has made it very clear that she will not  return
              to Pakistan with the appellant for any length of time.   That
              is a matter of choice for her.   Whilst  I  accept  that  the
              appellant will be emotionally upset if he cannot continue his
              family life with the sponsor, that is the wholly  predictable
              result from the decisions made by him and  his  wife  in  the
              past.  I am not satisfied the sponsor  is  reliant  upon  the
              appellant as her carer.


          45. On the evidence as a whole, I am  satisfied  that  this  is  a
              proportionate decision involving a proper  balancing  of  the
              competing public interest in maintaining immigration controls
              in  a  democratic  society  with  the  appellant's  and   the
              sponsor's private and family life."


The Grounds and Submissions

12.  The grounds set out a lengthy challenge to the  judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality under article 8.  Permission to appeal was  refused  by
    the First-tier Tribunal on the basis that it was not arguable that  the
    judge  had  erred  in  carrying  out  the  balancing   exercise.    The
    application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal and permission to  appeal
    was granted for the following reasons:


         "...2.   It is established that the  decision  complained  of  will
              result in the break up of a subsisting marriage.  This  is  a
              very serious consequence and cannot be justified easily.


               3. Arguably the First-tier Tribunal judge gave two reasons to
              support this conclusion.  They are that the  appellant  would
              not  earn  enough  money  to  satisfy  the  rules   regarding
              maintenance that it was particularly important to remove  him
              because of his cynical  disregard  for  immigration  control.
              However, it is arguable that no proper reason was  given  for
              rejecting the evidence that a  relative  of  the  appellant's
              wife would find him a job and that it was wrong to impugn the
              appellant  with  bad  motives  because   he   married,   with
              permission, a British citizen.  If, as the  judge  says,  the
              appellant needed to and did show an intention  to  leave  the
              United Kingdom in order to enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
              student, then it is arguable that the judge should  not  have
              concluded for the reasons given that the appellant never  had
              such an intention.  People  can  change  their  minds  and  a
              desire to remain in the United Kingdom  is  not  inconsistent
              with an intention to obey the Immigration Rules.


               4. The appellant must not assume that the Upper Tribunal will
              find any fault but, as explained above, I am  satisfied  that
              the grounds are arguable."

13.  Ms King crystallised the grounds into the  following  submissions.   In
    accordance with Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State [2008]  UKHL  39,  the
    article 8 rights of both the appellant and his wife must  be  respected
    and that family  life  entailed  not  only  the  consideration  of  the
    circumstances as they are now but the parties' hopes and intentions for
    the future: R (Fawad Ahmadi) v Secretary of State [2005] EWCA Civ 1721.

14.  Ms King referred to and relied on the  judgment  in  MM  and  Others  v
    Secretary of State [2013] EWHC 1900 which considered  the  implications
    of article 8 on the new Immigration Rules coming  into  force  in  July
    2012.   Blake  J  considered  that  a  combination  of  the   financial
    requirements would be disproportionate.

15.   She  submitted  that  the   judge   erred   in   her   assessment   of
    proportionality  as  she  failed  to  take  into  account  the  factors
    identified by in MM in particular by failing to consider the  sponsor's
    status as a British citizen, the loss of  an  opportunity  to  start  a
    family life and when saying that the sponsor's decision not  to  go  to
    Pakistan with her  husband  was  a  matter  of  choice  she  failed  to
    acknowledge that the loss of access to NHS medical treatment may render
    such choice unreasonable.  She submitted that whereas in  MM,  Blake  J
    recognised that exclusion  might  be  a  legitimate  and  proportionate
    restriction where a  spouse  had  remained  in  breach  of  immigration
    control, this applied when the  couple  married  after  the  reason  in
    favour of the restriction had already arisen i.e. after the spouse  had
    become an overstayer.

16.  After the appellant withdrew his appeal on 14 January 2010 he  promptly
    applied  to  regularise  his  status  and  that  application   remained
    undecided by the respondent until judicial review proceedings compelled
    her to make a decision.  She relied on R (Zhang) v Secretary  of  State
    [2013] EWHC 891 (Admin) to support her argument that where there was  a
    genuine  family  relationship,  it  would  only  be   in   rare   cases
    proportionate to require the appellant to leave to apply for entry from
    abroad.  So far  as  the  financial  requirements  of  the  rules  were
    concerned, the sponsor was able to work for only a  limited  number  of
    hours a week whereas the appellant was young and fit and able to obtain
    full employment.  There was evidence that the appellant had a job offer
    from his wife's  brother  but  the  judge  had  wrongly  rejected  that
    evidence.

17.  Mr Duffy submitted that the judge's findings and conclusions  had  been
    properly open to her for the reasons she gave.  He  accepted  that  the
    separate discussion of private life in [40] was not entirely clear  but
    when  the  determination  was  read  as  a  whole,  the  judge  clearly
    considered her family life and the effect removing the appellant  would
    have on her.  It had been open to the judge to find at  [16]  that  the
    offer of employment made by  the  appellant's  brother-in-law  was  not
    genuine.

Consideration of whether there is an Error of Law

18.  The issue for me at this stage of the appeal  is  to  consider  whether
    the First-tier Tribunal judge erred  in  law  such  that  her  decision
    should be set aside.  In MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of State [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 1192 the Court of Appeal held that  the  new  rules  do  provide  a
    complete code for the assessment of an article 8  appeal  but  that  in
    considering  whether  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  where  an
    appellant is otherwise unable to meet the requirements of the rules the
    assessment   must   be   carried   out   compatibly   with   Strasbourg
    jurisprudence.  The Court held that the use of the phrase  "exceptional
    circumstances" in the rules did not indicate that  the  respondent  had
    intended to re-introduce an exceptionality test as opposed to making it
    clear that it was only in exceptional cases  that  removal  of  a  non-
    national family member will constitute a violation of article 8.

19.  These comments very much echo the guidance given  by  Lord  Bingham  in
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 24 and repeated in Huang [2007]  UKHL  11  that  the
    number  of  claimants  not  covered  by  the  rules  and  supplementary
    directions but otherwise entitled to succeed under article 8 would be a
    very small minority.  Each case has to be examined on its own facts  to
    determine how the balance should be struck.

20.  In the present case the judge accepted that the  marriage  was  genuine
    but took into account that it was entered  into  when  the  appellant's
    immigration status was precarious.  He had withdrawn his appeal  on  14
    January 2010  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  student  and  had
    subsequently gone through a civil marriage ceremony.  Despite the delay
    by the respondent in making a decision on the further  submissions  the
    appellant's status remained precarious.  The judge was entitled to take
    this factor into account as relevant to the issue of proportionality.

21.  It is of even greater relevance that the appellant could not  meet  the
    requirements of the rules.  The judge did not have the  opportunity  of
    considering MM as it  was  issued  two  days  after  her  decision  was
    promulgated.  However, I am not satisfied that even that  decision  had
    been available to her that it would  have  altered  her  assessment  of
    proportionality.  In MM Blake J identified the five factors which taken
    together would make the refusal of leave to remain contrary to  article
    8: the minimum income level to be provided by the sponsor was above the
    �13,400 level identified by the MAC as the lowest maintenance threshold
    under the benefits and net fiscal approach; the requirement of  �16,000
    before savings could be said to contribute to an income shortfall;  the
    use of a 30 month period for the forward income projection  as  opposed
    to a twelve month  period,  the  disregard  of  credible  and  reliable
    evidence of the undertakings of third party support and  the  disregard
    of a spouse's own earning capacity  during  the  30  month  period  for
    initial entry.

22.  The sponsor's current income for employment of  �5,600/�5,700  a  month
    fell well short of the amount required.  The appellant  relied  on  the
    job offer from his brother-in-law but that evidence was rejected by the
    judge.  This was challenged by Ms King but the judge had  to  determine
    that matter on the evidence available to her.  She only heard  evidence
    from the appellant's sister-in-law and it was supported by letters  the
    latest dated 20 July 2010.  The judge was entitled to comment that  she
    did not find it credible that the position would  be  open  some  three
    years later given the current employment situation.  Therefore, even if
    the judge had taken into account the factors identified by Blake  J  in
    MM, she would not have come to a different decision.

23.  She considered the sponsor's medical condition at some  length  in  her
    determination and was entitled to find that she was more  than  capable
    of controlling her own medication.   She  was  entitled  to  take  into
    account the fact that the rules sought to  provide  that  every  family
    living in the UK enjoyed a minimum standard of living and was  able  to
    maintain itself without recourse to public funds  [42].   There  was  a
    delay in the respondent's decision making process but not  such  as  to
    engage any of the factors identified in EB  (Kosovo)  [2008]  UKHL  41.
    Reliance was placed on Zhang but that was a  decision  considering  the
    implications of  Chikwamba  [2008]  UKHL  40  in  the  context  of  the
    provisions of para 319C (h) (i) of the rules requiring  a  claimant  to
    leave the UK before she could apply to remain as the family member of a
    points-based  system  migrant.   It  was  therefore  dealing   with   a
    procedural not a substantial requirement such as the need to  meet  the
    financial requirements of the rules.

24.  I am not satisfied that the judge erred in law  in  her  assessment  of
    proportionality.  It was for her to balance the public interest in  the
    general administrative desirability of applying known rules between one
    applicant and another and so maintaining a fair system  of  immigration
    control with the interference to the private and personal  family  life
    of the appellant and the sponsor.  The grounds and submissions  do  not
    satisfy me that the  judge  erred  in  law.   She  reached  a  decision
    properly  open  to  her  for  the  reasons  she  gave  and   in   these
    circumstances this appeal must be dismissed.

Decision

25.  The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  err  in  law  and  accordingly  the
    decision stands.
