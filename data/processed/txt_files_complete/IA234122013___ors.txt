                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Nicholas Paul), sitting at Hatton Cross on  8  November
    2013, to  article 8 appeals by a citizen of India, born 1 August  1979,
    and her two sons Patrick (born 12 March 2007) and Joel (born  12  March
    2010) by her husband Melvin Peter (the sponsor, born 20 July 1973,  and
    also a citizen of India).

 2. The sponsor arrived in this  country  with  leave  to  enter  in  2002,
    staying here lawfully till he was given indefinite leave to  remain  on
    that basis in April 2013: he has now applied for  British  citizenship,
    which it is common ground he is likely to be granted, if he passes  the
    necessary tests, within the  next  six  months.  The  (main)  appellant
    married him in India in December 2004, and arrived here with  leave  to
    enter on 2 August 2005, staying here with leave till 22 June 2013,  and
    meanwhile giving birth to their sons.

 3. On 13 May 2013 the appellant and her sons applied for further leave  to
    remain, which was refused on 3 June, on the basis  that  they  did  not
    satisfy the 'new Rules', in particular appendix FM EX  1,  because  the
    boys, though both born in this country, had not of course been here for
    the required seven years. It is common ground that they cannot  succeed
    under the 'new Rules' on any other basis;  so,  following  the  various
    decisions, such as Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) Pakistan [2014] UKUT
    85 (IAC), which have made it clear that the principles set  out  in  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192  also  apply  in  cases  not  involving
    deportation,  they  need  to  show   circumstances   'exceptional'   or
    'compelling' enough for the Tribunal  to  go  outside  them  and  apply
    general article 8 principles.

 4. This was not spelt out by the first-tier judge, as it should have been,
    and permission to appeal was granted on that point, and  the  facts  of
    the case. The Home Office's case on the facts was  that  the  appellant
    and the  boys  could  have  gone  back  to  India,  not  just  to  make
    applications for entry clearance, but because it was  unfair  to  other
    prospective immigrants from there to let them  "jump  the  queue";  and
    that the result of  the  sponsor's  eventual  application  for  British
    citizenship was a matter of "pure conjecture".

 5. If the facts of the case themselves raise the  necessary  'exceptional'
    or 'compelling' circumstances, then the judge's failure  to  point  out
    the need for those is neither  here  nor  there.  As  for  the  "queue-
    jumping" point, it would have  had  a  great  deal  of  force,  despite
    Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40, if the appellant and the boys had  been  here
    without leave; but they were properly authorized to stay  by  the  Home
    Office till the decision now under appeal. Nor is  the  result  of  the
    sponsor's application a matter of  "pure  conjecture"  at  all:  as  Mr
    Jarvis helpfully confirmed, it is likely to be granted within  a  short
    time, so long as he passes the tests.

 6. As with most other considerations in article 8  cases,  there  are  two
    sides to the question of whether  circumstances  are  'exceptional'  or
    'compelling': while it is more common for that  to  be  argued  on  the
    family life side of the case, there  can  be  no  doubt  that  it  also
    applies to the question of what the public interest requires.  In  this
    case, the sponsor has been here with leave,  now  indefinite,  for  the
    last 12 years: he has an MBA and a suitable job, and  his  family  have
    been here with him, also with leave, for the  last  8ï¿½  years,  in  the
    appellant's case, or since they were born, in the boys'.

 7. It is more likely than not that the sponsor will soon become a  British
    citizen, with a corresponding right, subject to the ordinary  Rules  on
    dependants, to have his family here with him. Meanwhile the boys are in
    school, and they are all enjoying a normal family life  here  together.
    In my judgment, there is no significant  public  interest,  indeed  the
    reverse, in disrupting that state of affairs for the sake of compliance
    with the requirements of FM


    EX 1, and  so  the  circumstances  are  'exceptional'  or  'compelling'
    enough for me to say that the balancing exercise  must  result  in  the
    appellant and  the  boys'  expulsion  being  considered  overwhelmingly
    disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of .
