Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Aslam, Counsel instructed by Linkworth Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on 15 October 1981.  On 19
    September 2016 he applied for asylum.  His application was refused on
    28 July 2018.  He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal
    was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Onoufriou.  In a decision
    promulgated on 3 October 2018 the judge dismissed the appeal.  The
    appellant is now appealing against that decision.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The appellant's claim, in summary, is that he would be at risk of
    persecution if returned to Turkey because of his involvement with and
    connection to the G�len movement.  The appellant claimed, inter alia,
    that the police visited his family home looking for him.

 3. The judge found the appellant's account to be overall credible and
    accepted that he was involved with the G�len movement as he claimed.

 4. At paragraph 28 the judge summarised the appellant's involvement in the
    following terms.

         "According to the appellant his involvement consisted of initially
         being supported by the G�len movement in his education up to 2013
         when he graduated university.  He then took part in various
         activities including football events, theatrical events, picnics,
         attending meetings and providing moderate financial support.  At no
         point did the appellant state that he was involved in any agitation
         against the Turkish government nor did he state that he was
         involved in any way in the coup."

 5. At paragraph 29 the judge considered the appellant's claim that the
    police had gone to his home looking for him.  Although the rest of the
    appellant's claim was accepted as credible, this aspect was not.  The
    judge stated:

         "I am not satisfied that the police went to his home looking for
         him.  Other than his own evidence there is no evidence to back up
         this assertion.  There is no arrest warrant or other documentation
         to support his claim.  Consequently, I do not consider he would be
         at risk on return to Turkey, even if the Turkish authorities were
         interested in his father's political activities."

 6. In the decision, the judge referred to, and cited from, an Amnesty
    International Report on Turkey dated 2017/2018 and a Country Policy and
    Information Note on the G�lenist movement in Turkey dated February 2018
    ("the CPIN report").

 7. The judge concluded at paragraph 28 that he did "not think that [the
    appellant's] involvement with the G�len movement is of such a high
    profile that it would bring him to the attention of the authorities".

Grounds of Appeal

 8. The grounds of appeal argue that the judge erred by not giving proper
    consideration to the CPIN report which, according to the grounds,
    demonstrates that the appellant would face a risk on return to Turkey,
    given the nature and extent of his activities with the G�len movement.



 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara.  She
    observed that, although not argued in the grounds, there is an
    indication at paragraph 29 of the decision that the sole reason the
    judge did not accept the appellant's evidence that the police in Turkey
    had been looking for him was a lack of corroboration.

10. Before me, Mr Aslam argued that the judge had failed to engage with the
    CPIN report.  He highlighted references in the CPIN report to
    individuals being arrested in many different circumstances merely
    because of a connection to the G�len movement.  He noted in particular
    an example of a baker being arrested and compared this to the appellant
    who had worked in that area.

11. Building on the grant of permission to appeal, Mr Aslam argued that the
    judge had not explained why the appellant's claim that the authorities
    were looking for him was rejected when the rest of his account was
    accepted as credible.

12. Ms Isherwood argued that the grounds amount to no more than a
    disagreement with conclusions that were open to the judge. She
    submitted that at its highest the appellant's involvement with the
    G�len movement was only modest.  She argued that the CPIN report
    identified a number of groups who are at risk (judges, lawyers, foreign
    ministry staff, police officers, army officers, soldiers, teachers and
    academics), one of which applied to the appellant, Ms Isherwood
    submitted that given the appellant's low level of involvement with the
    G�len movement the judge was entitled to conclude that he would not be
    at risk.

13. Ms Isherwood did not object to the point raised by Judge Kamara in the
    grant of permission to appeal regarding lack of corroboration being
    pursued even though it was not within the grounds of appeal.  I
    therefore do not exclude this issue from consideration.

Analysis

14. The decision contains a material error of law.

15. Despite finding that the appellant's overall account was credible - and
    accepting that he was involved with the G�len movement as he claimed -
    the judge rejected the appellant's claim that the police looked for him
    at his family home. The sole reason given by the judge for rejecting
    this part of the appellant's account was that there was no documentary
    evidence to corroborate it.  Specifically, the judge stated that the
    appellant's account was rejected because of the absence of an arrest
    warrant or other documentation.

16. However, the appellant did not claim that he was arrested or that there
    was a warrant to arrest him.  He only claimed that the police looked
    for him at his home.  That being the case, there was no reason to
    believe there would be in existence documentation such as an arrest
    warrant. Requiring the production of an arrest warrant (or other
    documentary evidence) as corroboration of a claim that the police
    visited his house, when there was no reason, based on the appellant's
    account, for any such documents to be in existence, was an error of
    law.

17. The significance of the error (and the reason it is material) is that
    even though the appellant did not have a high profile within the G�len
    movement (and was not involved with the coup attempt), if the police
    have been looking for him it would be an important indicator that he
    was nonetheless of interest to the authorities.

18. I have considered whether I can proceed to remake the decision based on
    the objective evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal.
    Unfortunately, I have reached the view that I cannot.  The reason for
    this is that it will be necessary for a finding to be made on whether
    the police have looked for the appellant as this is relevant to whether
    the authorities have an interest in him.  To reach a determination on
    this issue it will be necessary to consider the credibility of the
    appellant's account.  As this will require considerable fact-finding I
    have decided that the matter should be remitted to the First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard afresh.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is
granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
indirectly identify him or any member of their family.  This direction
applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



Notice of Decision

A. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law
and is set aside.
B. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh
before a different judge.
