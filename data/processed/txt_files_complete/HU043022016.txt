                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hawden-Beal, promulgated on 21st March 2017, following a  hearing
    at Birmingham on 7th March  2017.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  therefore  the   appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born  on  5th
    March 1971.   He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 3rd February 2016 refusing his application for
    further leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  his  private  life.   The
    Appellant has acute kidney problems.  There is expert evidence that  he
    is at a critical stage.  Without a transplant he could die from  kidney
    failure.  An absence of dialysis could lead to death within one to  two
    weeks.  The appellant needs dialysis three times a week.  If he were to
    be returned to Bangladesh this would cost him around �125 to  �375  per
    week.  He has a sister and her husband in  Bangladesh.   However,  they
    could not pay for  this  treatment.   His  family  home  is  about  180
    kilometres away from Dhaka, the capital  city,  where  kidney  dialysis
    treatment would be available to him.  He  could  not  move  there.   He
    could not travel there every  other  day  of  the  week  to  have  this
    treatment three days a week.  His kidneys have failed  completely.   He
    is not passing  urine.   Anything  he  drinks  has  to  be  removed  by
    dialysis.  He also has arthritis which is treated by weekly injections.
     He is not married.  He has no children.  He  was  designated  suitable
    for kidney transplant two and a half years ago.  However, he was  taken
    off the list because of his lack of permanent immigration  status.   He
    was told that once his status is regularised a kidney transplant  would
    then become an  option  once  again.   He  maintains  that  if  he  got
    permission to remain in the UK he could possibly get a job and pay  for
    the treatment in  that  way.   However,  he  has  never  paid  for  any
    treatment whilst he has been in the UK.  He claims that no-one has ever
    asked him to pay for such treatment.  However, the Respondent Secretary
    of State, in refusing his application to remain here, has  stated  that
    he has outstanding debts for his national health service treatment from
    Epson and St Helier's NHS Trust, which on 16th August  2012,  raised  a
    debt against him of �6,928.11.  On  24th  October  2012,  it  raised  a
    further debt against him of �4,272.63.  The Appellant had not lived  in
    the UK for at least twenty years.  He was over the age of 18.   He  was
    not under 25 years of age.  He could not  point  to  "very  significant
    obstacles" to his integration back into Bangladeshi society because  he
    was born there.  He had spent the first 26 years of his life there.  He
    was familiar with the language and customs of Bangladesh.  He  had  two
    brothers and three sisters living there.  They could support him on his
    return there.

The Judge's Findings

 3. In a comprehensive and well-structured  determination,  IJ  Hawden-Beal
    recounted the evidence from the Appellant and his sister Mrs Roushanara
    Shilu, before noting the contents of the refusal letter that it was not
    credible that the Appellant would have received at his home address the
    appointment letters for hospital treatment  but  no  Invoices,  all  of
    which were sent to his London address, and yet he had not paid for  his
    treatment.  The judge went through the "Razgar steps" before concluding
    that this was a case which was on all fours with the  Court  of  Appeal
    judgment in GS (India) [2015] EWCA Civ 40.  The  judge  observed  that,
    "There is nothing within his claim which brings  him  within  the  very
    exceptional circumstances" which cases of this kind require to be shown
    (at paragraph 25).  Careful consideration was  given  to  the  European
    Court case of Paposhvili v Belgium [2017] Imm AR 867, which  the  judge
    recounted,

         "Should be understood to refer to situations involving the  removal
         of a seriously ill person in which substantial  grounds  have  been
         shown for believing that he or she, although not at  imminent  risk
         of dying, would face a real risk, on  account  of  the  absence  of
         appropriate treatment, or being exposed to a serious and rapid  and
         irreversible decline in his or her state  of  health  resulting  in
         intense suffering or to a significant reduction in life expectancy"
         (which is what was stated  at  paragraph  183  of  Paposhvili,  and
         confirmed at paragraph 38 of  the  recent  case  of  AM  (Zimbabwe)
         [2018] EWCA Civ 64).

 4. The judge went  on  to  thereafter  consider  "Whether  there  is  care
    available for the Appellant the  Respondent  and  Appellant  have  both
    confirmed  that  such  facilities  as  it  requires  are  available  in
    Bangladesh, albeit that it will not be of the same standard as that  in
    the UK" (paragraph 26).  The judge,  accordingly,  concluded  that  the
    Appellant could not bring himself  within  the  exception  set  out  in
    Paposhvili.  She concluded that, "There  are  facilities  available  to
    him, he has family there who I am satisfied could support him, and I am
    satisfied that his family here could also support  him,  as  they  have
    done since 2011" (paragraph 27).

 5. The final paragraph of the judge's determination, which considered  the
    application of Article 8 ECHR, saw the judge state that  the  Appellant
    could not succeed, "on the basis of the above illegal entry and  state,
    the cost of his treatment and the non-payment of his bills"  (paragraph
    28).

 6. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  law  because
    the Appellant's serious condition was acknowledged, but that the  judge
    then wrongly concluded that treatment was available in Bangladesh, even
    though such treatment was not local to the Appellant.   The  judge  had
    not disputed that the Appellant suffered from end-stage kidney  disease
    and that his life was dependent upon dialysis treatment, without  which
    he would die within one or two weeks.  In concluding as the  judge  had
    done, there had been a failure to consider the cases  applicable  which
    deal with the severity  of  the  medical  condition,  together  with  a
    failure to be able to access such treatment in the country  of  origin,
    on account  of  being  unable  to  afford  such  treatment.   At  first
    instance, in a decision made by the First-tier Tribunal on 2nd  October
    2017, permission  to  appeal  was  refused.   It  was  noted  that  the
    Appellant  simply  did  not  fall  under  the  exceptions  set  out  in
    Paposhvili given that he claimed, on the one hand to be saying that  he
    was no longer in contact with his relatives in Bangladesh, but  on  the
    other  hand  to  be  saying  that  he  knew  his  family  members  were
    struggling, which could not have been true if he was not in touch  with
    them.

 8. Upon reconsideration by the  Upper  Tribunal  on  27th  November  2017,
    however, permission to  appeal  was  granted  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant was suffering from end-stage kidney  disease  and  would  die
    within two weeks if medical treatment was withdrawn.  That being so the
    judge at the First-tier  Tribunal  had  failed  to  properly  reconcile
    Paposhvili with GS (India) [2015] EWCA Civ 40.   Although  the  judge's
    decision was carefully written, there was no obvious  consideration  of
    the Appellant's Article 3 ECHR rights.

 9. On 21st December 2017, a Rule 24 response was entered by the Respondent
    Secretary of State of State on the basis that, as far as Paposhvili was
    concerned, the Tribunal had held in EA and Others  (Article  3  medical
    cases - Paposhvili not applicable) [2017] UKUT 00445 that  it  was  not
    open to the Tribunal to apply that  case  by  reason  of  the  judicial
    precedent that arose by way of the Supreme Court judgment in N  v  SSHD
    [2005] 2 AC 296.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 9th February 2018, Mr Plowright,  appearing
    on behalf of the Appellant as Counsel, made the following  submissions.
    First, as  the  grant  of  permission  stated,  there  was  no  obvious
    consideration by the judge below of Article 3 ECHR.  Instead, the judge
    appears to have looked at Article 3 in the context of Article 8, and to
    have  treated  the  exercise  as  one  of  proportionality  before  the
    Tribunal.  This was the reason why the judge  states  at  paragraph  25
    that "the final question" was "whether the  decision  is  proportionate
    and I am satisfied that it is".  In  fact,  even  at  the  end  of  the
    determination, at paragraph 28, the judge approaches the matter as  one
    of proportionality, observing that what militated against the Appellant
    was his "illegal entry and stay, the cost of his treatment and the non-
    payment of his  bills".   The  conclusion  is  that,  "I  am  therefore
    satisfied that his physical and moral integrity will not be  undermined
    by his removal" with the observation that "the decision to  remove  him
    is proportionate" (paragraph 28). This, submitted Mr Plowright, was the
    wrong approach if the judge was required to consider  Article  3  as  a
    separate matter.

11. Second, insofar as the Rule 24 response relies on the fact that EA  and
    Others [2017] now establishes that domestic law  must  take  precedence
    over the European Court ruling in  Paposhvili,  the  position  has  now
    changed again because in AM (Zimbabwe) [2018] EWCA Civ 64, the Court of
    Appeal  re-emphasised  the  importance  of  Paposhvili  in  a  domestic
    jurisprudence.  In the instant case, two doctors have  drawn  attention
    to the end-stage kidney disease that the Appellant is  suffering  from.
    One states that he has two to three weeks to live and the other  states
    he has three to four weeks to live without drastic treatment.

12. For example, the letter from Epson and St Helier's NHS Trust (see  page
    24 of Taj Solicitors' bundle), which is dated 1st February  2017,  from
    the consultant responsible for the Appellant's management, states that

         "The above patient has end-stage kidney disease and this means that
         his kidney has  failed  to  the  point  that  they  are  no  longer
         performing enough to provide any useful function.  He  additionally
         has hepatitis (blood pressure) and has a  diagnosis  of  ankylosing
         spondylitis ... he receives  haemodialysis  for  four  hours  three
         times a week ...."




    The letter goes on to say (at page 25) that, "Without this he will  die
    within three to four weeks".  This was the first report by  Dr  Rebecca
    Sukling MRCP PhD.  The second report is by Dr Marie Condon and is dated
    12th May 2015 and she states that, "If he did not receive his  dialysis
    therapy he is likely to die within a short period (one to  two  weeks).
    He is never likely to regain kidney function ...."

13. Third, these facts therefore, suggested, on the basis of the  case  law
    in Paposhvili, that there was a procedural obligation on the Respondent
    Secretary of State to examine the Appellant's case  with  care  and  by
    reference to all the available evidence.  This was clear from the Court
    of Appeal judgment in AM (Zimbabwe) [2018], which  confirmed  that  all
    that the applicant had to  do,  on  the  basis  of  the  Grand  Chamber
    decision in Paposhvili, was that "He could have raised  a  sufficiently
    credible Article 3 case that it gave rise to  a  procedural  obligation
    ..." (paragraph 41).  What the Grand Chamber had established was  that,
    "The violation of Article 3 which the Grand  Chamber  held  would  have
    occurred if the applicant had been removed ... was a violation of  that
    procedural obligation" (paragraph 41).  That, submitted  Mr  Plowright,
    was the position here as well.

14. For his part, Mr Jarvis submitted that reliance on AM (Zimbabwe) [2018]
    was misconceived, as  that  was  a  very  different  case.   Mr  Jarvis
    submitted that paragraph 30 of that case bears closer scrutiny  because
    in that case neither of the Appellants, it was said  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal,

         "Can satisfy the test for breach of  Article  3  set  out  in  N  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department and N v United  Kingdom.
         The parties are also in agreement that the decision of the House of
         Lords in N v Secretary of State for the Home Department is  binding
         so far as this quote is concerned regarding the test to be  applied
         in domestic law in this type of case,  with  the  consequence  that
         both appeals to this court have to  be  dismissed.   It  is  common
         ground that this is so even though it appears that  the  ECtHR  has
         more recently, in Paposhvili, decided to clarify or qualify to some
         degree the test previously laid down in N v United  Kingdom,  which
         corresponds with that set  out  by  the  House  of  Lords  in  N  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department" (paragraph 30).

15. Second, submitted Mr Jarvis, if one now has regard to the earlier Court
    of Appeal case of GS (India) [2015], it  is  clear  from  paragraph  65
    that, the court felt itself bound by the ratio decidendi of  N  in  the
    House of Lords, where it was said (at paragraph 15) that,

         "The essential distinction is  not  to  be  found  in  humanitarian
         differences.  Rather it lies in recognising that Article 3 does not
         require contracting states to undertake the obligation of providing
         aliens indefinitely with medical treatment lacking  in  their  home
         countries."

    It was recognised that,

         "The Strasbourg Court has constantly reiterated that  in  principle
         aliens subject to expulsion cannot claim any entitlement to  remain
         in the territory of a contracting state in  order  to  continue  to
         benefit from medical, social and other forms of assistance provided
         by the expelling state.  Article 3 imposes no such  'medical  care'
         obligation on contracting states" (at paragraph 15).

  16. In GS (India) the Court of Appeal at paragraph 65  also  endorsed  the
      principle  in  N  (at  paragraph  36)  that  the  case   had   to   be
      "exceptional", such as was the case in D v UK, where the Appellant was
      "terminally ill" and  in  the  "advanced  stages  of  a  terminal  and
      incurable illness".  The Strasbourg Court had then made a reference in
      the words of Judge Pettiti, to  "the  final  stages  of  an  incurable
      illness".  In N v SSHD, the House of Lords said that, "It was the fact
      that he  was  already  terminally  ill  while  still  present  in  the
      territory of the expelling state that made his case exceptional"  (per
      Lord Hope at paragraph 36).




  17. On the basis of this jurisprudence, Mr Jarvis submitted that what this
      suggested was that one had to be looking at a deathbed case of  a  man
      going to his death.  This is clear from paragraph  69  of  N  v  SSHD,
      where the House of Lords stated that,

         "The test in this sort of case is whether the  applicant's  illness
         has reached such a critical stage (i.e. he is dying) that  it  will
         be inhuman treatment to  deprive  him  of  the  care  which  he  is
         currently receiving and send him home  to  an  early  death  unless
         there is care available there to enable him to meet that fate  with
         dignity" (per Lady Hale).

18. Mr Jarvis then proceeded to deal  with  the  more  recent  case  of  AM
    (Zimbabwe) [2018].  In this case, the Court of Appeal, as is submitted,
    actually gave guidance on  how  Paposhvili  was  to  be  applied.   Its
    guidance was important, because as the Court of Appeal pointed out  (at
    paragraph 32), there were presently

         "A significant number of other cases involving  claims  by  foreign
         nationals to resist removal from the UK by invoking  Article  3  on
         medical grounds which are already in the system, in which  reliance
         is sought to be placed on Paposhvili even  though  the  claims  had
         been dismissed by the application of N v Secretary of State for the
         Home Department and N v United Kingdom".

  19. As the Court of Appeal explained,




         "In those cases, orders have been made in a similar way to  prevent
         the removal of the Appellants from the  United  Kingdom  until  the
         final determination of their cases, which are  on  hold  until  the
         position in relation to the adoption of the guidance in  Paposhvili
         into domestic law has been clarified" (paragraph 32).

  20. In fact, as Mr Jarvis explained, the Court of Appeal was  aware,  that
      the cases were not simply confined to  those  that  had  already  been
      lodged on the basis of the application of Paposhvili.

  21. As the Court of Appeal explained, "In  addition,  similar  new  claims
      based on application of Article 3 on medical grounds  may  be  brought
      forward at any time."  However, the guidance given  by  the  Court  of
      Appeal in AM (Zimbabwe) was that,

         "In relation to those claims, all courts below  the  Supreme  Court
         will be bound by the decision in N v Secretary  of  State  for  the
         Home Department, but claimants  may contend that they have  grounds
         for saying that their cases are covered  by  the  new  guidance  in
         Paposhvili (in particular at paragraph 183) and that  any  question
         of their removal from the UK should be  stayed  until  the  Supreme
         Court has decided to modify domestic law (potentially  decisive  in
         their favour) by reference to that guidance" (paragraph 33).

22. Mr Jarvis submitted, however, that it was  not  necessary  to  await  a
    final outcome in the Supreme Court, before cases such  as  the  present
    one, could be disposed of.  This is because the Court of Appeal  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe) did give clear guidance.  It went on to say that,

         "We are providing authoritative guidance on the true interpretation
         of illegal criterion governing how  courts  and  Tribunals  in  the
         domestic legal system should make judgments regarding the  exercise
         of their powers to grant stays of removal.  That guidance  will  be
         formally binding upon courts and Tribunals below the level  of  the
         Supreme Court, in the usual way" (paragraph 36).

  23. As to what that guidance was to be, the Court of Appeal explained  the
      matter as follows.




  24. First, as far as Paposhvili  was  concerned,  "It  is  clear  both  at
      paragraph 183 of Paposhvili relaxes the test for violation of  Article
      3 in cases of removal of a foreign national with a  medical  condition
      and also that it does so only to a very modest extent" (paragraph 37).





  25. Second, that

         "So far  as  the  ECtHR  and  the  Convention  are  concerned,  the
         protection of Article 3 against removal in medical cases is now not
         confined to deathbed cases where death is already imminent when the
         applicant is in the removing country.  It extends  to  cases  where
         'substantial grounds  have  been  shown  for  believing  that  [the
         applicant], although not at imminent risk of dying,  would  face  a
         real risk, on account of the absence of  appropriate  treatment  in
         the receiving country or lack of access to such treatment, or being
         exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or  her
         state of health resulting in intense suffering or to a  significant
         reduction in life expectancy'(paragraph  183).   This  means  cases
         where the applicant faces  a  real  risk  of  rapidly  experiencing
         intense suffering (i.e. to the Article 3 standard) in the receiving
         state because of their illness and the  non-availability  there  of
         treatment which is available to him in the removing state or  faces
         a real risk of death within a short time in the receiving state for
         the same reason" (paragraph 38).

  26. What this meant according to the Court of Appeal in AM (Zimbabwe)  was
      that,




         "In other words, the boundary of  Article  3  protection  has  been
         shifted from being defined by imminence of death  in  the  removing
         state (even with the treatment available there) for  being  defined
         by the imminence (i.e. likely as  'rapid'  experience)  of  intense
         suffering or death in the receiving state,  which  may  only  occur
         because of the non-availability in  that  state  of  the  treatment
         which  had  previously  been  available  in  the  removing   state"
         (paragraph 38).

27. Finally, Mr Jarvis submitted that in any event, the judge in this  case
    did apply Paposhvili and did conclude that the Appellant did  not  face
    the prospect of imminent death or suffering.  This was clear  from  the
    judge's treatment of the facts at paragraphs 25, 27, and 28.   For  all
    of these reasons, the judge, submitted Mr Jarvis, did not err  in  law,
    and this appeal should not succeed.

28. In reply, Mr Plowright submitted that, he would have to accept that  if
    the Appellant did not fall within the structures  of  Paposhvili,  then
    his appeal would fail.  However, there were two issues to contend with.
     First, whether there was treatment available in Bangladesh.  Secondly,
    whether  there  was  a  potential  risk  of  death  arising  from   the
    Appellant's removal given his end-stage kidney problems.  With  respect
    to neither of these two questions, submitted Mr  Plowright,  could  one
    confidently say that the judge  had  approached  the  matter  correctly
    because this had been done through the prism of Article  3,  which  had
    tainted the eventual analysis to be undertaken with respect to  Article
    3.  This was clear from the judge's approach at paragraphs 19, 25,  and
    28.  It is this inadequate consideration of Article 3 that must lead to
    the conclusion that the judge had failed to consider  the  availability
    of treatment in a practical and effective way, so as to not violate the
    Appellant's Article 3 rights, were he to be returned to Bangladesh.  He
    asked me to allow the appeal.

Error of Law

29. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

30. First, this is a case where the Appellant is suffering  from  end-stage
    renal disease and is currently on  dialysis  treatment  (haemodialysis)
    and the prognosis is that without a transplant he would die from kidney
    failure.  The evidence of a locum  consultant  nephrologist,  Dr  Marie
    Condon, is that without dialysis  treatment  the  Appellant  would  die
    within one to two weeks.  The prognosis of the second doctor is that he
    would not live beyond four weeks.  Second, as against that, it  is  the
    case that the Appellant has family members in Bangladesh.  Judge Hawden-
    Beal was rightly sceptical of the Appellant's contention  that  he  was
    not in touch with them, when he was at the same time  maintaining  that
    they were struggling to make ends meet themselves,  and  would  not  be
    able to provide him with the necessary assistance that he  would  need,
    in order to travel from his own village at some great distance  to  the
    capital city Dhaka where there  was  availability  of  kidney  dialysis
    machines.  I also note that at paragraph 14 of the Appellant's  witness
    statement (at page 18) does not state that there are not enough  kidney
    dialysis machines in Dhaka.  The issue is  one  of  access  to  medical
    treatment.

31. Second, on the issue of whether, realistically speaking, the  Appellant
    will be able to access his  much  needed  treatment  in  Bangladesh,  a
    number of issues are relevant here. The Appellant has not been  working
    in the UK, and has kept a low profile such that, as  Judge  Hawden-Beal
    correctly stated, were it not for  his  illness  he  would  never  have
    brought himself  forward  to  the  attention  of  the  authorities  (at
    paragraph 28).  However, precisely because of his illness,  he  is  not
    likely to be able to gain employment in Bangladesh either upon arrival.



32. It is also the case that the treatment  that  he  requires  has  to  be
    spread out over a week during three alternative  days.   If  he  cannot
    relocate to Dhaka, and there is no evidence that he has the means to be
    able to do so, then he has to travel from his village  regularly  every
    other day in order to undertake the kidney dialysis  treatment  without
    which he would die.

33. In AM (Zimbabwe) the Court  of  Appeal  most  recently  considered  the
    concept of "other very exceptional cases" (see paragraph 183) which was
    a term considered in the judgment of N v United Kingdom  (at  paragraph
    43), with a view to analysing how an issue may be raised under  Article
    3, so as to cover the situation of those facing  removal  as  seriously
    ill persons.

34. What is required is that,

         "Substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he or  she,
         although not at immediate risk of dying, would face a real risk, on
         account of the absence of appropriate treatment  in  the  receiving
         country or the lack of access to such treatment, of  being  exposed
         to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or her state of
         health resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction
         in life expectancy" (at paragraph 183).

  35. On the evidence in this appeal, it is clear that "substantial  grounds
      have been shown" that there is a "real risk",  that  in  the  specific
      circumstances of the Appellant's case,  there  would  be  a  "lack  of
      access to such treatment" which would expose him to "a serious,  rapid
      and irreversible decline" in his health,  the  consequences  of  which
      would be  to  afflict  with  him  with  "intense  suffering  or  to  a
      significant reduction in life expectancy".




  36. Dhaka has only 35 kidney dialysis  machines.  The  Appellant's  family
      lives eight hours away in a village.  The treatment of kidney dialysis
      itself takes four hours.  He would have to  undertake  a  twenty  hour
      expedition three times a week in order  to  go  from  his  village  to
      Dhaka.  That is bound, if not to put him at "imminent risk  of  dying"
      certainly to expose him to a "real risk" of a "rapid and  irreversible
      decline" in his health.

37. Third, Judge Hawden-Beal was perfectly alive to  the  legal  principles
    established by Paposhvili.  In fact, at paragraph 25, she expressly and
    verbatim draws upon paragraph 183 of AM (Zimbabwe)  in  distilling  the
    jurisprudence arising from Paposhvili and  N  v  UK.   The  difficulty,
    however, is that this particular paragraph is prefaced  also  with  the
    remarks that the final question was "as  to  whether  the  decision  is
    proportionate" so as to suggest  that  Article  3  was  not  considered
    separately  in  its  own  right  unaffected  by  considerations  of   a
    proportionality that arise  in  Article  8  cases.   It  is  true  that
    thereafter the judge does make firm findings of fact, in the context of
    the application of Paposhvili, to say that the facilities are available
    to the Appellant, his family is there, they would be  able  to  support
    him, and they have done so since 2011 (see paragraph 27), but there  is
    still no reference here to Article 3, and this still follows  on  after
    consideration of Article  8.   Indeed,  the  concluding  paragraph  (at
    paragraph 28) returns  back  to  considerations  that  are  germane  to
    Article 8, where attention is drawn to the cost of his treatment in the
    UK and the non-payment of his bills in this country.  It  is  concluded
    that "his physical and moral integrity will not be  undermined  by  his
    removal" (paragraph 28) which are  categories  of  rights  relevant  to
    Article 8 but not relevant to Article 3 ECHR.

38. Finally, there is the jurisprudence itself.  The guidance given by  the
    Court of Appeal in AM (Zimbabwe) [2018] is that "Paposhvili relaxes the
    test for violation for Article 3" but that "it does so only to  a  very
    modest extent" (paragraph 37).  That modification, to a  very  moderate
    extent, is what is the case here.

39. As the Court of Appeal made clear, the protection of Article 3  against
    removal in medical cases "is now not confined to deathbed  cases  where
    death is already imminent" but  requires  instead  a  consideration  of
    whether, due to lack of treatment, the person  in  question  is  "being
    exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible  decline  in  his  or  her
    state of health", with the result that,

         "The boundary of Article 3 protection has been shifted  from  being
         defined by imminence of death in the removing state (even with  the
         treatment available there) to being defined by the imminence  (i.e.
         the likely 'rapid' experience) of intense suffering or death in the
         receiving state" (at paragraph 28).

  40. The current jurisprudence accordingly fits  the  predicament  of  this
      Appellant.  In so concluding, I am mindful of the fact that the  Court
      of Appeal in AM (Zimbabwe) also pointed out that it was




         "Significant that even on the extreme and exceptional facts of  the
         Paposhvili case, where the applicant faced a  likelihood  of  death
         within six months if removed to Georgia, the Ground Chamber did not
         feel able to say that it was clear that a violation  of  Article  3
         would have occurred for that reason had he been removed".

  41. What the Grand Chamber had been able to say was  that  "The  applicant
      had raised a sufficiently credible Article 3 case that it gave rise to
      a procedural obligation  for  the  relevant  domestic  authorities  to
      examine that case with care and with reference to  all  the  available
      evidence" (paragraph 41).




  42. In the instant case that "procedural obligation" has been fulfilled in
      this case in that both the Secretary of State and the  Tribunal  below
      has considered whether a "sufficiently credible Article  3  case"  had
      been raised by the Appellant.  Both have concluded that  it  has  not.
      That conclusion, however, on the evidence, that I have  recounted,  is
      not sustainable.  On the evidence, this case is "exceptional".



  43. Even in N v UK, the Strasbourg Court used language to cover  precisely
      this sort of case.  Judge Pettiti referred to "the final stages of  an
      incurable illness" Lord Hope in the House of Lords, in  terms  of  our
      domestic law, referred to the fact that  the  Appellant  was  "already
      terminally ill while still present in the territory of  the  expelling
      state that made his case exceptional" (at paragraph 36).



Remaking the Decision

44. I remake the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons that I have  set  out
    above.

Notice of Decision

45. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

46. No anonymity direction is made.
