                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer  I  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant,  a  citizen  of  Nigeria,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision made by the Entry Clearance Officer on 23rd
    August 2014 to refuse her entry clearance to join  her  spouse  in  the
    United Kingdom.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Wylie dismissed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules but allowed the appeal under Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer
    appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor
    have been in a relationship since 2002.   They  met  in  Nigeria.   The
    Sponsor is a British citizen who lives and works in  the  UK.   He  has
    been resident in the UK for over 30 years.  When he met  the  Appellant
    he was married to another woman with whom he had  two  daughters.   She
    and the  Sponsor  continued  their  relationship  while  the  Appellant
    remained in Nigeria.  The couple have three children born in 2004, 2006
    and 2008 all of whom are British citizens and all  of  whom  reside  in
    Nigeria with the Appellant.  The Appellant and the Sponsor  married  on
    19th August 2011.  The Appellant applied for entry  clearance  to  join
    the Sponsor in the UK and  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the
    application on the  basis  that  he  was  not  satisfied  that  various
    requirements of Appendix FM had been met.  At the hearing in the First-
    tier Tribunal the judge accepted that there is adequate  accommodation,
    that the Appellant satisfies the English language requirement, and that
    the  Sponsor  and  the  Appellant  have  a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship and that they intend to live together permanently  in  the
    UK.  The judge also accepted  that  the  Sponsor  has  an  income  from
    employment of more than ï¿½18,600 per year.  However the judge considered
    the specified evidence produced with the application and at the hearing
    and concluded that all of the specified evidence required  by  Appendix
    FM-SE had not been produced  and  therefore  the  Appellant  could  not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.

 4. The judge proceeded to consider the  appeal  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Court of Human Rights.  The judge accepted that the  Appellant
    had family life with the Sponsor and their three children and that  the
    decision would interfere with that family life.  The judge went  on  to
    consider proportionality and considered the nature of the  relationship
    between the Appellant, the Sponsor and the three children.   The  judge
    had regard to the decision in SSHD v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and
    noted that there should be compelling circumstances to justify leave to
    enter should the Rules in Appendix FM-SE not  be  complied  with.   The
    judge concluded that there are such compelling  circumstances  in  this
    case.  The judge noted that there  is  substantial  evidence  that  the
    Sponsor meets the income requirement and has been working for the  same
    employer for seventeen years, has lived in the UK for  over  30  years,
    has adult children living and working in the UK, the three children are
    British citizens and they are entitled to live and be educated  in  the
    UK.  The judge noted that  the  Sponsor  would  have  to  give  up  his
    longstanding pensionable employment to move to Nigeria for family  life
    to be enjoyed there and noted that a fresh application with  up-to-date
    payslips and bank statements, with a further letter from his  employer,
    would meet the requirements of the  specified  evidence  and  that  the
    application would be allowed. The judge  concluded  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate in this case to refuse the application  for  leave  to
    enter.

 5. In the Grounds of Appeal the Entry Clearance Officer submitted that the
    compelling circumstances quoted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in
    this case are not compelling at all.  The Entry Clearance  Officer  did
    not disagree with most of the judge's findings but  did  disagree  with
    the suggestion that the Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  said  that  the
    Sponsor should move to Nigeria to continue family life because where he
    chooses to live as a British citizen is a matter for him.

 6. The grounds contend that in his proportionality  assessment  the  judge
    ignored the fact that the Sponsor's  relationship  with  the  Appellant
    began in 2002 and that all three children they had together  were  born
    in Nigeria at a time when the Sponsor was married to someone  else  and
    that  these  were  lifestyle  choices  made  by  the  Sponsor  and  the
    Appellant.  It is contended that the position taken by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge that the best interests of the children would be  served
    by being with both parents ignores those lifestyle choices already made
    by the  Sponsor  and  cannot  therefore  be  considered  as  compelling
    circumstances as identified in SS (Congo).  It is  contended  that  the
    remedy for the Appellant and the Sponsor is properly put by the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 37 in that the Appellant can submit  a
    new  application  as  Article  8  cannot  be  used  to  circumvent  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is contended that the entry clearance refusal in
    this case merely maintains  the  status  quo  and  cannot  properly  be
    described as disproportionate.

 7. At the hearing before me Mr Kotas relied in particular on paragraphs 87
    and 57 of SS (Congo).  He submitted that it is proportionate to  expect
    the Appellant to make a fresh application.

 8. Mr Green submitted that all relevant documents were in  fact  submitted
    to the Entry Clearance Officer but that  the  documents  were  lost  in
    transit.  He said he did not know why this issue had  not  been  raised
    before the First-tier Tribunal Judge but  accepted  that  he  had  been
    represented by Counsel in the First-tier Tribunal.  He  submitted  that
    he did have the missing payslip from April 2014 and had bank statements
    covering  the  relevant  period.   He  submitted  that  the  children's
    situation is compelling as his children were meant to start  school  in
    September and they cannot start school in the  UK  without  his  wife's
    presence here.

 9. In response Mr Kotas accepted what the Sponsor had said.   He  accepted
    that the missing documents in terms of Appendix  FM-SE  are  the  April
    2014 wage slip and bank statements covering the  relevant  period.   Mr
    Green produced those documents.  Mr Kotas viewed the documents and  was
    satisfied that these documents do in fact show that the  Appellant  met
    the requirements of Appendix FM-SE as at the date of the decision.

Error of Law

10. There appears to have been  a  difficulty  in  terms  of  the  evidence
    presented to the First-tier Tribunal.  The  Appellant's  bundle  before
    the First-tier Tribunal contains evidence of the Sponsor's payslips and
    bank statements in  relation  to  October  2014  to  April  2015.   The
    relevant period for determination in relation to  the  requirements  of
    the Appendix FM-SE was the period prior to the application which was in
    the middle of May 2014.

11. I have considered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo).  I
    note that in paragraph 87 the court said in  relation  to  one  of  the
    Appellants in that case:

         "The fact that he would lose his job  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
         hence  would  prefer  to  establish  family  life  here  does   not
         constitute compelling circumstances to require  the  grant  of  LTE
         outside the Rules: as the authorities made clear,  Article  8  does
         not create a right for married couples  to  choose  to  live  in  a
         contracting state."

    I also note paragraph 57 where Lord Justice Richards said:

         "In certain of the appeals before  us,  the  Respondent  said  that
         improvements in the position of their Sponsors were on the horizon,
         so that there appeared to be a reasonable prospect  that  within  a
         period of weeks or months they would in fact be able to satisfy the
         requirements of the Rules.  They maintain  that  the  Secretary  of
         State should have taken this into account when deciding whether  to
         grant LTE outside  the  Rules.   In  our  judgment,  however,  this
         affords very weak support for a grant of  LTE  outside  the  Rules.
         The Secretary of State remains entitled to enforce the Rules in the
         usual way, to say that the Rules have not been satisfied  and  that
         the applicant should apply again when the circumstances have indeed
         changed.  This reflects a fair balance between the interests of the
         individual and the public interest.  The Secretary of State is  not
         required to take a speculative risk as to whether the  requirements
         of the Rules will in fact be satisfied in the future when  deciding
         what to do.  Generally, it is fair that the applicant  should  wait
         until the circumstances have changed and that the  requirements  in
         the Rules are satisfied and then apply, rather than  attempting  to
         jump the queue by asking for  preferential  treatment  outside  the
         Rules in advance".

12. Whilst I note that the judge did take account of  the  decision  in  SS
    (Congo) I do not accept that the judge has given sufficient reasons for
    accepting that there are compelling circumstances in this  case,  given
    the lifestyle choices made by the Appellant and the Sponsor  which  led
    to the fact that the Appellant has not lived in the UK throughout their
    relationship and that the children were born and have been  brought  up
    in Nigeria.  In my view, in considering  the  public  interest  in  his
    proportionality assessment, the judge also failed to take into  account
    properly the fact that a fresh application could be  made  and  may  be
    successful.  The fact that a fresh application could be made is in this
    case  a  factor  to  be  given   significant   weight   in   terms   of
    proportionality in that if the Appellant made a fresh application which
    is likely to be granted it is not disproportionate to expect  that  she
    should do so.  If the Rules could be met then Article 8 should  not  be
    used as a means by which the Rules can be bypassed.

13. For these reasons I consider that the judge has made an error of law in
    allowing the appeal on human  rights  grounds.   I  therefore  set  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

Re-making the decision

14. In terms of re-making this decision Mr Kotas accepted, on  viewing  the
    documents held by Mr Green, that the April 2014 payslip  has  now  been
    produced and that the bank statements for the relevant  period  of  six
    months prior to the date of the application have now been produced  and
    these documents demonstrate that the Appellant met the requirements  of
    the Rules at the time of the application.  Mr Kotas accepted that these
    documents could be considered at this stage despite it not being  clear
    whether they were submitted with the application.   Although  Mr  Green
    states that these documents were produced with the application  he  has
    not produced any evidence to substantiate his claim that documents were
    produced and were lost in the post.

15. I note that the findings made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge were not
    challenged. In light  of  Mr  Kotas's  concession  that  the  documents
    produced meet the requirements of Appendix FM, I am satisfied that  the
    Appellant has  demonstrated  that  she  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules at the relevant time.  I therefore allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  contained  a  material
    error of law and I set it aside.  I re-make the  decision  by  allowing
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because  it  has  not  been  established  that  the  relevant  evidence  was
submitted with the application.
