JUDGMENT

UTJ GLEESON:  The applicant has permission to seek judicial  review  of  the
      respondent's decision to refuse to grant her further leave  to  remain
      following an application to extend her Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
      leave to remain.

   2. The principal applicant  does  not  dispute  that  the  documents  she
      provided with her application were  not  the  specified  documents  in
      paragraph 46-SD.  The respondent's refusal letter  cites  at  least  8
      failures to meet the requirements of the  Rules:   the  document  from
      Companies House evidencing her directorship was  not  in  the  correct
      format; there were no company bank statements at all; there was little
      to show that the appellant had invested �200,000 of her own money; and
      sparse, if any, evidence of current involvement with the company.  The
      accountant's letter provided was not an original document and gave few
      details about the business or its  employees.   Further,  it  did  not
      appear, on the evidence advanced, that the  applicant  had  created  2
      full-time employee posts, as required.

   3.  In  her  refusal  letter,  the   respondent   confined   herself   to
      consideration of the absence or presence of the  specified  documents,
      having regard to the evidential flexibility  provisions  of  paragraph
      245AA of the Rules.  The respondent did not proceed to  carry  out  an
      assessment  of  the  substantive  Tier  1   (Entrepreneur)   extension
      application  under  sub-paragraph  245DD(k),   since   the   specified
      documents had not been produced  and  she  considered  that  paragraph
      245AA (the 'evidential flexibility' provision within  the  Rules)  did
      not assist the applicant.

   4. The applicant had, and exercised, a right of administrative review  of
      the respondent's refusal, which resulted in a revised decision letter,
      but the respondent maintained her refusal, by reason of  the  multiple
      failures in the documents accompanying the application, which were not
      in accordance with the documents specified in paragraph 46-SD  of  the
      Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended).

   5. In the revised decision letter, the respondent considered the  further
      documents supplied by the  applicant,  in  accordance  with  paragraph
      245DD and in particular sub-paragraph 245DD(b) of Appendix A, but  not
      under sub-paragraphs 245DD(l) and (k) of the Rules,  as  the  evidence
      still did  not  meet  the  specified  documents  in  the  Rules.   The
      respondent considered that the missing  specified  documents  did  not
      fall within a series of documents, and that she was not required to go
      beyond the documents submitted and request further documents, pursuant
      to sub-paragraph 245AA(b) of Appendix A of the Rules.

   6. The respondent noted, in particular, that  the  principal  applicant's
      unaudited  accounts  showed  investment  of  �140,000   approximately,
      together with a  letter  from  Interactive  Investor  indicating  that
      �203,850 was available from investors, to be invested in the  business
      in future.  The respondent did  not  consider  that  showed  that  the
      applicant had personally invested �200,000.

   7. The applicant stated that she had provided a bank letter  from  Lloyds
      TSB with details of her business bank account.   The  respondent  said
      she had received no such document, nor any business  bank  statements.
      The respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  sub-
      paragraph 46-SD (b) of Appendix A, or sub-paragraph  46-SD  (c)(ii)(2)
      were met.

   8. The applicant  had  provided  a  Companies  House  printout,  but  the
      respondent considered that as it was dated 9 February 2015 (more  than
      3 months before the application to extend Tier 1 leave)  and  did  not
      set out the appointment  history  or  confirm  that  the  company  was
      registered at Companies House within 8 months of the  grant  of  entry
      clearance on 11 September 2012,  the  applicant  could  not  meet  the
      requirements  of  sub-paragraph  46-SD(f)(ii)  or  46-SD  (g)(ii)   of
      Appendix A.

   9. In relation to job creation, the  applicant  had  supplied  a  payroll
      summary for August and September 2015 and a photocopy of a printout of
      an accountant's letter.  The payroll information did not cover a  full
      12 months for 2 employees, as the Rules require, and the applicant had
      therefore failed to meet  the  requirements  of  sub-paragraphs  46-SD
      (h)(i)-(x) of Appendix A.

  10. The applicant then carried out  the  Pre-Action  Protocol  and  issued
      judicial review proceedings.

  11. The grounds for review contend that the  unaudited  accounts  provided
      showed the correct amount invested  in  her  business;  that  she  had
      indeed provided a letter from Lloyds TSB confirming the details of her
      business bank account and her name as the person  in  charge  of  that
      account; that she had provided an appointment  report  outside  the  3
      months period before the date of application which the Rules required,
      and other documents  confirming  that  she  was  engaged  in  business
      activity at the  date  of  application;  and  that  she  had  provided
      evidence of the engagement of 2 settled workers.   The  applicant  did
      not suggest that she had provided the business bank  statements  which
      the Rules require.

  12. The applicant's grounds for  review  assert  that  it  is  'abundantly
      clear' that the applicant satisfies the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
      requirements of the Rules, and if the respondent had any  doubts,  she
      should have contacted the applicant  to  request  clarification.   The
      applicant  argued  that  the  missing  information  could  be  readily
      ascertained from the documents provided,  alternatively  that  further
      clarification should have been requested.  Finally, the applicant says
      that the respondent's position is perverse,  alternatively  Wednesbury
      unreasonable, because the respondent had failed to  apply  fairly  and
      lawfully the 'evidential flexibility' discretion in paragraph 245AA of
      the Rules,  and  that  no  reasonable  Secretary  of  State,  properly
      directing herself, would have made the decisions  under  challenge  or
      considered them to be within the range of reasonable decisions open to
      her.

   Permission for judicial review

  13. Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan refused permission for judicial review on
      the papers.  On  19  July  2016,  following  an  oral  hearing,  Upper
      Tribunal Judge King granted permission  for  judicial  review  in  the
      following terms:

           "Challenge is made to the decision of 22 October  2015  refusing
           leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  under  the  points-
           based system.  Decisions on the matter had been made before  and
           this reflected the amended decision of the respondent.

           It was common ground that in a number of respects the  applicant
           had not provided documents that were in  the  form  required  by
           paragraph 46-SD of Appendix A of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
           decision itself cited some 8 or 9 examples of documents  not  in
           the correct  or  required  form.  The  summary  defence  of  the
           respondent sets out in considerable detail the  shortcomings  in
           respect of the documentation that was produced.

           It was submitted, on behalf of the applicant, that it would have
           been reasonable of the respondent to have requested the relevant
           documents before arriving at a decision.  This was a case, it is
           contended, where  the  applicant  had  already  been  running  a
           business  for  three  years  and  it  was  apparent   from   the
           documentation that was submitted that that was still  the  case.
           In those circumstances it would not have been difficult for  the
           respondent to have asked for the correct documents, which  could
           easily have been provided.

           The decision in the House of Lords [sic] in Mandalia [2015] UKSC
           59 was cited and in particular, paragraph 34 thereof.   It  made
           clear that there was no limit to the amount of information  that
           could be requested and where there was uncertainty as to whether
           evidence existed the applicant should be given  the  benefit  of
           the doubt and it should be requested.

           It is further said that even under the policy of  245AA  dealing
           [with]  the  documents  not  submitted  with  applications,  the
           opportunity to request original documents or  documents  in  the
           correct format could apply.

           Such a power lies to the discretion of  the  respondent  who  in
           turn  must   exercise   any   discretion   reasonably   in   the
           circumstances.  It may be argued that given the  extent  of  the
           lack of correct documentation and the fact that  the  applicant,
           having already been granted leave in  that  capacity,  ought  to
           have known what documents were  required,  such  a  request  was
           reasonable or sensible in circumstances.

           The case of Mandalia was concerned  with  a  limited  number  of
           documents, and not with many documents submitted  in  the  wrong
           form or  with  the  inaccurate  information.   For  example,  no
           company bank accounts were submitted.  There was a  request  for
           Companies House documents showing the appointment history of the
           company.  Those documents are easily to be obtained  and  indeed
           have now been obtained by  the  applicant.   There  was  perhaps
           little reason why they could not  have  been  presented  at  the
           right time and in the right manner according to the  Immigration
           Rules.  Had the respondent considered matters on that basis,  it
           is doubtful  that  there  would  be  any  basis  upon  which  to
           challenge her decision.

           The difficulty in this case is however that discretion was  not,
           seemingly, exercised in the refusal. Reliance was placed in  the
           decision, as indeed was placed in submissions  before  me,  upon
           245AA(c), in which  it  is  said  that  documents  will  not  be
           requested where a specific document has not been submitted.  The
           last paragraph of the decision at page 6 makes  it  clear  that,
           acting upon that particular passage, there is no  obligation  to
           request the missing information.  There  is  little  indication,
           therefore, that any discretion, whether to request documents  or
           not, had been exercised.

           I grant permission on the narrow ground as to  whether  245AA(c)
           is a restriction which can now stand in the light of Mandalia."

  14. The ground on which permission was granted is one on which  the  Upper
      Tribunal has no  jurisdiction.   It  is  unclear  whether  Judge  King
      intended to shut out the other grounds advanced  in  the  grounds  for
      review. The applicant contends that, properly understood,  Judge  King
      intended to limit permission to the respondent's  residual  discretion
      outside paragraph 245AA, because the respondent has power to waive the
      Immigration Rules, or to act outside  them,  and  that  the  vires  of
      paragraph 245AA is not in question in these proceedings.

  15. I therefore proceed  to  consider  the  remaining  grounds,  with  the
      assistance of Mr Biggs' skeleton argument for the applicant  and  that
      of Mr Adams, for the respondent.  I have also  had  the  advantage  of
      oral submissions from both Counsel.  I do not consider it necessary to
      reproduce those submissions in full in this decision.

  16. That is the basis on which this application comes before me today.

   Jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal

  17. To the extent that the  applicant's  submission  is  framed,  applying
      Mandalia, as a challenge to the validity of the Rule itself, the Upper
      Tribunal has no jurisdiction, because pursuant to section 18(3) of the
      Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and the Lord Chief Justice's
      Direction given on 21 August  2013,  challenges  to  the  validity  of
      statutes, secondary legislation, and the  Immigration  Rules  are  not
      transferred to the Upper Tribunal.

  18. At the beginning of the hearing, Mr Biggs  clarified  the  applicant's
      position:  he accepted that Mandalia turned on the  application  of  a
      policy which was not in effect at the material times, relevant to this
      application, and that paragraph 245AA could  not  be  satisfied.   His
      argument was that the respondent always has a residual  discretion  to
      act outside the Rules, and that on orthodox principles, based  in  the
      need to consider material matters and to embark upon  a  discretionary
      judgment, rather than upon any species of unfairness,  the  respondent
      was required to consider acting outside the Rules in this case.

  19. Mr Biggs accepted that, for  the  reasons  set  out  by  Lord  Justice
      Beatson, with whom Lord Justice Christopher Clarke  and  Lady  Justice
      Arden agreed, in R on the application of  Sayaniya  v  Upper  Tribunal
      (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and another [2016]  EWCA  Civ  85,  a
      submission either that the Rule in question  was  ultra  vires  as  an
      unlawful fetter, or on the grounds of unfairness, was not open to  the
      applicant.

  20. Mr Biggs confirmed that the applicant was not seeking to challenge the
      validity of the Rule, but rather, the  respondent's  exercise  of  her
      discretion thereunder, and her residual discretion outside the  Rules.
      On that basis, I am satisfied that I do have jurisdiction to  consider
      this application and I proceed to do so.

   The applicant's case

  21.  The  applicant  admits  that  she  has  not  provided  the  specified
      documents.  Her secondary contention in the grounds for review, and in
      Mr Biggs' skeleton argument, is that  the  respondent  has  failed  to
      exercise her residual discretion to consider granting leave to  remain
      outside the Rules, whether or not the specified  documents  have  been
      provided.

  22. The applicant relies on sub-paragraph 245AA(c) of the Rules, in  which
      the  respondent  expressly  reserved  the  right  to  request  further
      documents  if  not  provided,  and  on  the  respondent's   evidential
      flexibility policy.    The  applicant  contends  that  the  respondent
      should have exercised her paragraph 245AA discretion, or her  residual
      discretion  outside  the  Rules,  to  contact  the  applicant  or  her
      representatives and ask for the omitted documents to be  provided,  in
      the required format or otherwise.

  23. The applicant had already been running her business for 3 years,  with
      Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  leave,  and  her  case  is  that  the  missing
      documents could easily have been provided. Alternatively, had she been
      given the opportunity, the applicant  contends  that  she  could  have
      satisfied the respondent by providing  other  documents  and  evidence
      than those produced with her application. The applicant does  not  now
      produce, and has never produced, a set of documents to the  respondent
      or the Tribunal which  would  meet  all  of  the  specified  documents
      requirements.

  24. In his  oral  submissions,  Mr  Biggs  argued  that  the  respondent's
      residual discretion entitles her at any time to waive any  requirement
      of the Immigration Rules, which he accepted normally set out the steps
      to be taken by applicants and the  approach  the  Secretary  of  State
      should take to examining their applications.  The applicants' position
      was a modest one: the respondent had acknowledged  that  she  had  not
      gone beyond the  narrower  discretion  within  paragraph  245AA.   Her
      failure to consider exercising her discretion outside  the  Rules  was
      plainly material to the outcome of the application.

  25. The applicant would rely on Ex parte Manjoo Khan [1980] 1 WRL 569  (no
      neutral  citation  is  available  on  BAILII)  which  held  that   the
      respondent, by acting inconsistently with the Rules, could be held  to
      have impliedly waived them.  The applicant would also rely on Munir  &
      Anor, R (on the application of) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2012] UKSC 32 at [25]-[26] and  [44],  Thapa,  R  (On  the
      Application Of) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2014]
      EWHC 659 (Admin) at [34]-[35], and on Mandalia.

  26. As to materiality, the applicant would rely on Smith v  North  Eastern
      Derbyshire Primary Care Trust &  Anor  [2006]  EWHC  1338  (Admin)  as
      authority for  the  proposition  that  relief  should  be  granted  in
      judicial review unless the error is immaterial to the outcome  of  the
      decision.  The applicant also relied on  the  decision  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal in Ukus (discretion: when reviewable) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 307
      (IAC) that where a failure to exercise  a  discretion  is  found,  the
      proper order is that the application remains before the respondent for
      a lawful decision to be made.

  27. Mr Biggs submitted that it could not be concluded that  a  fair-minded
      decision maker, properly directing him or herself, and  aware  of  the
      existence of the discretion, would not  have  given  the  applicant  a
      chance to meet the respondent's concerns on the specified documents.

  28. Mr Biggs then made submissions of detail on  the  evidence  which  was
      before the respondent at the administrative review stage, in  relation
      to the funds invested, and in relation to job creation.   He  accepted
      that the applicant could not  show  that  she  had  employed  the  two
      individuals as payroll-based employees for 12 months, but argued  that
      'new full-time jobs'  in  Table  5  of  Appendix  A  did  not  exclude
      subcontractors. The respondent had failed to explore that possibility.

  29.  The  applicant  was  not  relying  on  procedural,  but  substantive,
      unfairness.  It was  an  error  of  law  to  fail  to  appreciate  the
      existence  of,  or  to  exercise,  the   residual   discretion.    The
      administrative review decision was entirely new as  to  reasoning  and
      that was what the  applicant  wished  to  challenge.   The  Evidential
      Flexibility Guidance  was  broad  enough  to  allow  the  exercise  of
      discretion  in  the  applicants'  favour.   The  applicant  relied  on
      Mandalia at [31] and hashem Ali in the Supreme Court at [15].  Had the
      respondent been aware of her discretion,  and  exercised  it,  it  was
      entirely possible that the outcome would have been different.

   Respondent's case

  30. For the respondent, Mr Adams relied  on  his  skeleton  argument,  the
      respondent's summary grounds and her detailed grounds.  Permission had
      been granted on a narrow ground on which the  applicant  now  accepted
      that the Upper Tribunal had no jurisdiction.  In his  submission,  the
      Mandalia attack on paragraph 245AA was unarguable in any event.

  31. The case  now  advanced,  which  was  not  covered  by  the  grant  of
      permission, was that the respondent was under a  public  law  duty  to
      consider exercising her residual discretion outside the Rules in every
      case, which would drive a coach and  horses  through  the  established
      authorities on the points-based system and the extent to  which  there
      was a duty on the respondent to consider the  exercise  of  discretion
      outside the Rules.  The respondent would rely in particular on Alam  &
      Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ  960,
      on Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rodriguez [2014]  EWCA
      Civ 2, on EK (Ivory Coast) v The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1517, and on SH (Pakistan) v  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 426.  The principles  to
      be extracted from those decisions  were  that  the  onus  was  on  the
      applicant to provide the specified documents to satisfy  the  decision
      maker; that burden was a key requirement for the efficient working  of
      the points-based system.

  32. Decision makers  were  not  required  to  engage  in  the  solving  of
      crossword puzzles  in  order  to  reach  a  decision.   There  was  no
      requirement on the decision maker to point out  deficiencies,  explain
      the system, or notify the applicant of missing  documents.  Evidential
      flexibility policies, where in place,  provided  a  limited  departure
      from the general principle that the  onus  was  on  the  applicant  to
      evidence the application.

  33. Even if there were such a discretion, judicial review  should  not  be
      granted as the outcome would have been the same.   Only  some  of  the
      missing specified documents had  ever  been  provided,  unlike  in  SH
      (Pakistan) where they were all available by the date of hearing.   The
      funds problem, or the  employee  problem,  were  sufficient  alone  or
      together  to  justify  the  refusal  of  the  application,  which  was
      seriously deficient in a number of respects when made,  only  slightly
      better at the administrative review stage, and remained deficient even
      at the date of hearing. Even had there been a  general  obligation  to
      invite an applicant to put right the  application  by  submitting  the
      specified documents after the event, this applicant had not shown that
      she could do so.

   Mr Biggs' response

  34. In reply, Mr Biggs observed that Rodriguez in the Court of Appeal  was
      the case which in the Supreme Court  became  Mandalia,  and  had  been
      overturned. The Court of Appeal authority was no longer good law.   He
      contended, further, that the scope of the grant of permission did  not
      exclude the  arguments  which  had  been  advanced  before  the  Upper
      Tribunal at the hearing today.

Paragraph 245AA

   2. Paragraph 245AA of the Rules, so far as relevant, is as follows:

      "245AA.     Documents not submitted with applications

      (a)    Subject to sub-paragraph (b), where Part 6A or  any  appendices
      referred to  in  Part  6A  state  that  specified  documents  must  be
      provided, the decision maker (that is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
      Immigration Officer or the Secretary  of  State)  will  only  consider
      documents received by the Home Office before the  date  on  which  the
      application is considered.

      (b)   If the applicant has submitted the specified documents and:

                 (i) some of the  documents  within  a  sequence  have  been
                 omitted (for example, if one page from a bank statement  is
                 missing) and the documents marking the beginning and end of
                 that sequence have been provided; or

                 (ii) a document is in the wrong format (for example,  if  a
                 letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or

                 (iii) a document is a copy and not an original document; or

                 (iv) a document does  not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                 information;

                 the  decision  maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                 representative  in  writing,  and   request   the   correct
                 documents. Such a request will only be made once,  and  the
                 requested  documents  must  be  received  at  the   address
                 specified in the request within 10 working days of the date
                 of the request.

      (c)   Documents will not be requested under sub-paragraph (b) where:

                 (i) a  specified  document  has  not  been  submitted  (for
                 example an English language certificate is missing); or

                 (ii)  where  the  decision  maker  does  not   think   that
                 submission of the missing or correct documents will lead to
                 a grant because the application will be refused  for  other
                 reasons.

      (d)   If the applicant has submitted a specified document:

                 (i) in the wrong format; or

                 (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or

                 (iii)  which  does  not  contain  all  of   the   specified
                 information, but  the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                 from:
                 (1)   other documents submitted with the application; or
                       (2)  the website of the  organisation  which  issued
           the document; or
                 (3)   the website of the appropriate regulatory body;

           the decision maker may request the correct document  under  sub-
           paragraph (b), or may grant the application despite the error or
           omission, if satisfied that the specified documents are  genuine
           and the applicant  meets  all  the  other  requirements  of  the
           Rules."
                                                            [Emphasis added]

   3. It will be seen that under paragraph 245AA,  the  decision  maker  has
      discretion to accept late documents, but only the  correct  documents,
      or has a discretion to grant the application,  despite  the  error  or
      admission, where all the other requirements of the Rules are  met  and
      the documents produced satisfy her that they are genuine.

Discussion

   4. The basis on which this  application  was  granted  permission  cannot
      stand, and is no longer in issue.  The applicant's  case  has  changed
      before me.  She  now  concedes  that  the  Mandalia/  paragraph  245AA
      argument is ultra vires the Upper Tribunal and does not pursue it.  My
      primary view is that  Judge  King  intended  to  limit  the  grant  of
      permission to that issue, and that therefore,  once  the  jurisdiction
      point was conceded, there was no case to answer.

   5. However, Judge King did not say that 'no other grounds can be argued'.
       In the alternative, therefore, I have considered  the  case  advanced
      today, which differs from the grounds for review.  The applicant  does
      not seek to argue  that  there  is  any  procedural  unfairness.   The
      applicant recognises that the limited discretion,  italicised  in  the
      citation of paragraph 245AA above, will not avail her  on  the  facts.
      Even now, the specified documents have not been fully provided.

   6. Nor is there satisfactory evidence that  the  applicant  employed  two
      settled employees as Table 5 requires:  as set out at paragraph  46-SD
      (h), the evidence required is the evidence which is created by  taking
      a  person  on  as  an  employee.   The  applicant's  contention   that
      employment of sub-contractors is sufficient is unarguable.

   7. This application would have failed, on that basis alone, even  if  the
      principal applicant had been able to produce  all  the  other  missing
      documents, because it is not her case  that  the  two  individuals  in
      question were her employees (that is, settled and employed on  a  PAYE
      basis, with all the usual documents  that  generates)  for  12  months
      before the present application was made.

   8. I have considered the authorities to which Mr Biggs referred me.   The
      Supreme Court in Munir, dealing with the DP5/96 policy held  that  the
      1971 Act replaced the existing Immigration Rules, with  a  reservation
      for the prerogative power 'exercisable by Her Majesty in  relation  to
      [enemy] aliens'.  The  case  concerned  the  exercise  of  a  flexible
      concessionary  policy   outside   the   Rules,   and   pre-dated   the
      incorporation into the Rules of the evidential flexibility policy.  At
      [46] Lord Dyson, giving the judgment of the Court, said this:

           "46.  For the reasons that I  have  given,  I  would  reject  Mr
           Swift's submission that the issuing of  a  concessionary  policy
           (or indeed the waiving of a  requirement  in  the  rules  in  an
           individual case) is an exercise of prerogative power  which  for
           that reason does not come within the scope of section 3(2). But,
           subject to the constraints to which  I  have  referred  and  any
           relevant public  law  principles,  the  Secretary  of  State  is
           authorised by the 1971 Act to  make  policies  setting  out  the
           principles by which she may, as a matter  of  discretion,  grant
           concessions in individual cases to those seeking leave to  enter
           or remain in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  less  the  flexibility
           inherent in the concessionary policy, the more likely it  is  to
           be a statement "as to the practice to be  followed"  within  the
           meaning of section 3(2) and therefore an immigration  rule.  But
           DP5/96 was amply flexible and was therefore not  an  immigration
           rule and did not have to be laid before Parliament."

   9. The situation in the present application  is  not  comparable  to  the
      DP5/96 policy  problem:  the  present  Rules  have  been  laid  before
      Parliament and, save in exceptional circumstances, are  the  beginning
      and the end of the analysis of whether the  respondent  has  exercised
      her discretion properly.

  10. In Thapa, Helen Mountfield QC, sitting alone, held as follows at [31]-
      [35]:

           "31.  The Claimant  in  the  present  case  does  undertake  the
           challenge eschewed in RK in that he attacks the fairness of  the
           process through which  the  decision  was  made  to  proceed  to
           enforcement action under section  10  IAA  1999,  not  just  the
           factual or legal basis for that decision.

           32.   As I have noted, it was common ground that, having  formed
           a view that the Claimant was working in breach of the conditions
           of his visa, the immigration officer  had  a  discretion  as  to
           whether to take enforcement action or not, and if so, whether to
           do so down the curtailment route, triggering an in-country right
           of appeal  under  s82(2)(e)  NIAA  2002  or  the  administrative
           removal route, triggering  an  out-of-country  right  of  appeal
           under s82(2)(g) 2002.

           33.   I accept that where, as here, there is  a  discretion,  it
           must be seen to be exercised and exercised fairly. I also accept
           that there is  no  evidence  here  to  support  the  Defendant's
           assertion that there was an exercise of  discretion  as  between
           the alternative enforcement routes: nothing in the documentation
           or Ms Khay's evidence supports that statement.

           34.   However, that might have been an entirely  academic  point
           if it were obvious  that  the  only  possible  or  realistically
           likely exercise of such discretion would  be  to  enforce  under
           section 10 IAA 1999 in the circumstances of the case."

  11. In the present  case,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  only  possible  or
      realistically likely exercise of the respondent's  discretion  outside
      the Rules, if relevant, is that  the  application  would  be  refused.
      There are simply too many documentary  and  evidential  flaws  in  the
      application as made, which have not subsequently been  rectified,  and
      in the case of the employees, cannot be put right retrospectively.

  12. I do not accept that any passage in the Smith case  is  authority  for
      the proposition relied upon.  In relation to Ukus, the Upper  Tribunal
      gave the following useful guidance about the exercise of discretion:

           "1.  If  a  decision  maker  in  the  purported  exercise  of  a
           discretion vested  in  him  noted  his  function  and  what  was
           required to be done when fulfilling it  and  then  proceeded  to
           reach a decision on that basis, the decision is a lawful one and
           the Tribunal cannot intervene in  the  absence  of  a  statutory
           power to decide that the discretion should have  been  exercised
           differently (see s 86(3)(b) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
           Asylum Act 2002).

           2.  Where the decision maker has failed to exercise a discretion
           vested in him, the Tribunal's jurisdiction on appeal is  limited
           to a decision that the failure  renders  the  decision  'not  in
           accordance with the law' (s 86(3)(a)). Because the discretion is
           vested in the Executive, the appropriate course will be for  the
           Tribunal to require the decision maker to complete his  task  by
           reaching a lawful decision on the outstanding application, along
           the lines set out in SSHD v Abdi [1996] Imm AR 148.  In  such  a
           case, it makes no difference whether there is such  a  statutory
           power as is mentioned in paragraph 1 above.

           3.  If the decision maker has lawfully exercised his  discretion
           and the Tribunal has such a statutory power, the  Tribunal  must
           either (i) uphold the decision maker's decision (if the Tribunal
           is unpersuaded that the decision maker's discretion should  have
           been exercised differently); or (ii) reach a different  decision
           in the exercise of its own discretion."

  13. That guidance was given regarding the exercise  or  otherwise  of  the
      Upper Tribunal's statutory appellate functions, which are not  engaged
      in judicial review proceedings.

  14. Turning finally, so far as relevant, to the decision  of  the  Supreme
      Court in Mandalia, that case arose out of the failure of a case worker
      to ask for a missing bank statement which was obviously available, and
      came at one end of a series.  The respondent contended  that  she  was
      only required to ask for  documents  missing  from  the  middle  of  a
      series.

  15. Lord  Wilson,  giving  the  judgment  of  the  Court,  held  that  the
      evidential flexibility policy did not limit the documents which  could
      be requested, provided that the  request  was  not  speculative;  that
      where it was obvious that other documents in a series  existed,  which
      might supply the deficiency, they should be  requested;  that  it  was
      permissible to request missing documents at either end of  the  series
      of documents provided, not just those  missing  in  the  middle  of  a
      series; and that, where there was uncertainty in the caseworker's mind
      as to  whether  the  documents  existed,  after  consultation  with  a
      supervisor, the  caseworker  could  and  should  request  the  missing
      document or documents.

  16. I bear in mind, in dealing  with  this  application,  that  the  Upper
      Tribunal  has  before  it  a  party  who  represents  herself  as   an
      experienced business woman, who has run a business  for  3  years  and
      already made one successful  application  for  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
      Migrant status on that basis. The specified documents are very clearly
      specified and  their  continued  absence,  at  least  in  some  cases,
      supports the respondent's  conclusion  that  probably  they,  and  the
      circumstances they would evidence, do not exist.   That  is  certainly
      the case with the employees, even on the applicants' own case  as  now
      advanced.  In the present case, the documents and evidence which  were
      missing were such that any request for all or many of  them  would  be
      speculative.  It was not  a  case  where  the  document  or  documents
      obviously existed, or were very likely to do so.

  17. Although a residual discretion to grant any kind of  leave  to  anyone
      always exists, outside the Rules, it will rarely be appropriate for it
      to be considered or exercised.  On the facts of this case,  I  am  not
      satisfied that there is any reason why the respondent can properly  be
      criticised for not doing so.  There are no  exceptional  circumstances
      here: quite the contrary.  This was a  perfectly  ordinary  matter  of
      business, and a competent businesswoman should have had no  difficulty
      in meeting the specified documents and employment requirements of  the
      Rules as they stand.

  18. For all of the above reasons, I do not find that  judicial  review  of
      the  respondent's  decision  is  appropriate.   This  application   is
      dismissed.

  19. I turn next  to  the  question  of  costs  and  the  Upper  Tribunal's
      obligation to deal with the question of any onward appeal to the Court
      of Appeal.

  20. Subject to any submissions on costs or application for  permission  to
      appeal which may be received within 7 days of the handing down of this
      judgment on Wednesday 8 February 2017, my decision is that costs  will
      follow  the  event  in  this  application.   The  applicants  are  the
      unsuccessful party and will pay the respondent's costs, to be assessed
      if not agreed.
