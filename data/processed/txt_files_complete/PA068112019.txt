                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                           DECISION AND DIRECTION

 1. The Tribunal issued a direction dated 28 October 2020 to the parties on
    29 October 2020. The direction indicated that the  Tribunal  considered
    that where error of law had been found after this was conceded  by  the
    respondent and findings of fact had to be re-made de novo, remittal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal was the correct disposal for the  re-making  of
    this appeal. The parties were directed to respond  within  14  days  if
    they objected to that disposal. The parties were directed that where no
    objection was made this would be taken as deemed consent to remittal to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. Neither party has objected to the disposal proposed  by  the  Tribunal.
    The appeal is therefore remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  appeal
    to be re-made de novo.

DECISION

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error on a point of
    law and is set aside.

 4. The appeal will be re-made de novo by the First-tier Tribunal.
