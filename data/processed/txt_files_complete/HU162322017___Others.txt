Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms R Moffat (counsel) instructed by Wesley Gryk
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    This is an appeal by the Appellants against  the  decision  of  First-
tier Tribunal Judge Lawrence promulgated on 05/9/2018, which  dismissed  the
Appellants' appeals on all grounds.

Background

3.    The appellants are all nationals of Pakistan. The first Appellant  was
born on 8/11/1974. The second appellant was born on  27/08/1981.  The  third
appellant  was  born  on  9/6/2009.  The  fourth  appellant  was   born   on
12/02/2014. The second appellant is the first appellant's  wife.  The  first
and second appellants are the parents of the third and fourth appellants.

4.    The first appellant entered the UK as a student on  5  December  2003.
He had leave until 31 October 2008. He made a  number  of  applications  for
extension of that leave which were each refused, but he remained in the  UK.
He made a number of unsuccessful appeals and sought judicial review  without
success. His last application for leave to remain was made on 5  April  2017
and resulted in a refusal decision dated 16 November 2017 creating  a  right
of appeal.

5.    The second appellant joined the  first  appellant  in  the  UK  on  18
August 2008 as the first  appellant's  spouse.  She  was  granted  leave  to
remain in line with the first appellant. The  third  and  fourth  appellants
were born in the UK. The appellants applied for leave to remain  in  the  UK
on article 8 ECHR grounds. At that stage the third  appellant  had  been  in
the UK for more than seven years.

6.    On 16 November 2017 the Secretary of  State  refused  the  Appellants'
application.

The Judge's Decision

7.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal Judge NMK Lawrence ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 25 October  2018
Judge Povey gave permission to appeal stating

    "1.    The appellants seek permission to appeal against a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lawrence,  who  in  a  decision  and  reasons
    promulgated on 5 September  2018,  dismissed  the  appellants'  appeals
    against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse their  applications
    for leave to remain.


    2.     The grounds of appeal allege that the Judge erred in law in  his
    assessment whether it was reasonable for  the  third  appellant  (as  a
    qualifying child) to relocate with her family to Pakistan, erred in his
    assessment of the best interests of the third and fourth appellants and
    ignored relevant evidence.


    3.     In considering the issues of reasonableness and best  interests,
    the Judge recited various extracts from caselaw (at [10]- [28])  before
    summarising his understanding of the  applicable  legal  principles  at
    [29]. The syntax of that paragraph was confusing  and  it  was  unclear
    what test the Judge concluded he was required to apply. It was arguable
    that the Judge misdirected  himself  in  applying  a  test  of  "strong
    reasons" for granting leave, despite earlier citing  the  dicta  in  MA
    (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 that strong  reasons  were  required  to
    refuse a grant of leave. It was arguably unclear as to  how  the  Judge
    treated the significance which the authorities required be given to the
    third appellant's 7-plus years in the UK.


    4.     As such, the application  for  permission  to  appeal  disclosed
    arguable errors of law and permission to appeal is granted. All grounds
    may be advanced."

The Hearing

8.    Mr Clarke told me that in light of the  decision  in  KO  (Nigeria)  v
SSHD [2018] WLR 5273 he  could  not  argue  that  the  Judge's  findings  in
relation to section 117B(6)  of  the  2002  are  sustainable.  He  and  Miss
Moffat, for the appellant, joined in asking me to  find  that  the  decision
contains a material error of law. On joint motion, they asked  me  to  remit
this case of First-tier Tribunal to be determined of new.

Analysis

9.     The  third  appellant  is  a  qualifying  child.  At  the   date   of
application, she had lived in the UK for more than seven years. She  is  now
lived in the UK for 9  ï¿½  years.  The  Judge  acknowledges  that  the  third
appellant is a qualifying child. He relies heavily on MA  (Pakistan)  [2016]
and MT & ET [2018] in his analysis of whether or not it  is  reasonable  for
the third (and fourth) appellant to leave the UK.  At  [29]  he  appears  to
look for "strong  reasons"  for  granting  leave  to  remain.  At  [36]  his
analysis of s.117B(6)(b) rests  almost  entirely  on  consideration  of  the
weight to be accorded to the best interests of the child and the search  for
"strong reasons" found between [16] and [29] of the decision.

10.    Since  the  Judge's  decision  was  promulgated,  the  Supreme  Court
decision in KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] WLR 5273 has become  available.  That
decision provides both focus and guidance  on  the  application  of  section
117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

11.   Parties are agreed that the Judges consideration  of  section  117B(6)
of the 2002 Act is inadequate and no longer  sustainable  in  light  of  the
decision in KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] WLR 5273 . The  decision  contains  a
material error of law. I set it aside. Parties' agents agree that  I  should
not substitute my own decision and that a further fact-finding  exercise  is
necessary, and that updated evidence is required.






Remittal to First-Tier Tribunal

12.    Under  Part  3  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Practice
Statement of the 25th of September 2012 the case  may  be  remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

    (a)    the effect of the error has been to deprive a party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or  other  opportunity  for  that
    party's case to be put to and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or




    (b)    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
    necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such
    that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is
    appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

13.   In this case I have  determined  that  the  case  should  be  remitted
because a new fact-finding  exercise  is  required.   None  of  the  Judge's
findings are preserved. A complete re-hearing is necessary.

14.   I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Hatton  Cross
to be heard before any First-tier Judge other than Judge Lawrence.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is tainted  by  material  errors  of
law.

I set aside the Judge's  decision  promulgated  on  5  September  2018.  The
appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined of new.



Signed
                       Date 21 December 2018
