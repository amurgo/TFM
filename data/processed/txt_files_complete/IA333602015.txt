Representation:
Appellant   Ms Faryl, Counsel, instructed by Walker Prestons
Respondent  Mr McVeetie (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. I do not make an anonymity order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

    2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on June 11, 2009 with leave
       to enter as a  student  until  October  31,  2012.  This  leave  was
       extended until October 13, 2014. On June 13, 2014  he  submitted  an
       application  for  leave  to  remain.  The  respondent  refused   his
       application on October 9, 2015 on the basis the appellant  had  used
       deception on October 23,  2012  by  submitting  a  fraudulent  TOEIC
       certificate.  The   respondent   therefore   refused   his   current
       application under the Immigration Rules on  the  basis  he  did  not
       satisfy Section S-LTR1.6 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules.
       The respondent further  refused  the  application  under  paragraphs
       276ADE HC 395 and found no exceptional grounds existed to allow  the
       appeal under article 8 ECHR.


    3. The appellant appealed against that decision  on  October  23,  2015
       under section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
       2002.


    4. The appellant's appeal came before former Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Heynes (hereinafter called the "Judge") on  July  27,  2016
       and in a decision promulgated on August 3,  2016  he  dismissed  the
       appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.


    5. The appellant appealed that decision  on  August  16,  2016  and  on
       February 24, 2017 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Parker  found
       there was an arguable error of law.


    6. The matter came before me on the above date.


    7. Ms Faryl adopted her  grounds  of  appeal  and  submitted  that  the
       Judge's decision was brief and in considering the  facts  failed  to
       have regard to the approach set out in SM and  Qadir  v  SSHD  (ETS-
       evidence -burden of proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC). The Judge failed
       to take account of the account put forward during  the  hearing  and
       only took into account events after the test.


    8. Mr McVeetie accepted, after considering  the  Tribunal's  record  of
       proceedings, that the Judge had failed to take any  account  of  the
       account put forward by the appellant and there was an error in law.

    9. Both representatives agreed that this matter should be remitted back
       to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

   10. In light of Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice  Statement  I
       direct the matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

   11. I direct that any additional evidence should be served on  both  the
       Tribunal and other party in accordance with the  current  Procedural
       Rules. In particular, it would assist the Tribunal if the  appellant
       provided a detailed witness statement addressing  evidence  that  he
       would wish to give at the next hearing.

DECISION

   12. The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo
       hearing.

   13. If an interpreter is required then the appellant's solicitors should
       notify the Tribunal not less than seven  days  before  the  remitted
       hearing date.


Signed:                                 Dated:
