               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Haq, Solicitor, Global Immigration Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1) These are the approved record of the decision and reasons which I  gave
    orally at the end of the hearing on 22nd February 2021.

 2) Both representatives and I attended the hearing via  Skype,  while  the
    hearing was also available to watch, live, at Field House.  The parties
    did not object to attending via Skype and  I  was  satisfied  that  the
    representatives and the appellant, who gave live evidence, were able to
    participate in the hearing.

 3) This is the remaking of the decision in the appellant's appeal  against
    the respondent's decision on 29th May 2019 to deprive the appellant  of
    his acquired British citizenship.  I have previously set out  the  gist
    of the respondent's decision in my decision and reasons promulgated  on
    6th February 2020, in which I found that a previous First-tier Tribunal
    had erred in law in  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal.   My  previous
    decision  is  annexed  to  these  reasons,  and  the  summary  of   the
    respondent's decision is at ��2 to 3. I do not repeat them again. I did
    not preserve any findings of fact in my previous  decision,  but  given
    the narrowness of the issue, relating to deception, I  regarded  it  as
    appropriate to retain remaking of the appeal  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.



The Hearing

 4) I agreed with the representatives the documents which they wanted me to
    consider, and the issues that needed to be resolved.

 5) The respondent provided an  alpha-numerically  numbered  bundle,  which
    included her deprivation decision; an  earlier  decision  in  2003,  in
    which she refused the appellant's asylum claim; the appellant's CSID or
    identity card; the appellant's  application  for  naturalisation  as  a
    British  citizen  in  2008;  and  subsequent  correspondence  from  the
    appellant's  then-solicitors,  lodging  an  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in June 2019, in which,  on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  they
    appeared to accept that he had been advised not  to  provide  his  full
    correct  details  and  had  provided  incorrect  details  for  fear  of
    persecution.  The respondent also provided, loose, a number  of  policy
    documents, including its Operational Guidance  note  of  October  2002;
    guidance to decision-makers on the deprivation and nullity  of  British
    citizenship,  chapter  55;  and  guidance  to  its  decision-makers  in
    relation to the good character requirement for naturalisation, Annex  D
    to Chapter 18 dated March 2005, in force at the time of the appellant's
    application for naturalisation in 2008.

 6) The appellant provided a paginated bundle which  included  two  written
    witness statements which he adopted in the hearing  before  me  and  on
    which he was cross-examined by Mr Clarke.

The issues in this appeal

 7) I identified and agreed with the representatives  the  issues  in  this
    appeal. The representatives  agreed  that  they  were  limited  to  the
    following two issues:

      a) 'fraud' -  whether the respondent has shown, to the ordinary  civil
         standard (the balance of probabilities) that the appellant acquired
         his British citizenship by fraud, as set out  in  the  respondent's
         decision,  for  the  purposes  of  section  40(3)  of  the  British
         Nationality  Act  1981.   'Fraud',  in  this   context,   means   a
         representation dishonestly made on the appellant's part  or  active
         concealment of a material fact.

      b) 'Causation' - whether, had the respondent  known  of  the  relevant
         facts when she  considered  (1)  whether  to  grant  the  appellant
         exceptional leave to remain in 2003 and the later  application  for
         indefinite leave to remain; (2) whether to  grant  the  appellant's
         application for naturalisation in  2008,  her  knowledge  of  these
         facts would have affected her decision.

 8) The representatives agreed that  I  did  not  need  to  consider  wider
    questions  relating  to  the   appellant's   human   rights   and   the
    proportionality of  the  deprivation  decision.   Put  simply,  if  the
    respondent showed the relevant fraud and  causation,  Mr  Haq  accepted
    that the appellant's appeal should fail.   Nevertheless,  I  needed  to
    consider the evidence before me as to the relevant asserted  fraud  and
    causation afresh, and not as a 'rationality' review, as per the summary
    in BA (deprivation of citizenship: appeals) [2018] UKUT 00085 (IAC).

Other aspects of the Hearing

 9) The hearing was conducted via Skype for business. I  attended  remotely
    as did the representatives and the appellant, who gave  oral  evidence.
    Whilst there were initially  a  small  number  of  disruptions  to  the
    transmissions of  the  hearing,  at  each  stage  I  checked  with  the
    appellant and the representatives whether any part of  the  proceedings
    had been missed;  where  the  appellant  initially  had  difficulty  in
    hearing us, we were able to  resolve  this  satisfactorily  and  I  was
    satisfied that during his evidence, the appellant was able to  see  and
    hear us and we were able to see and hear him. He gave  evidence  via  a
    translator in Kurdish Sorani and at the beginning of the  hearing  they
    had a discussion and confirmed their understanding of  one  another.  I
    was satisfied therefore that both the appellant and the representatives
    were able to participate fairly and effectively in the hearing.

The appellant's evidence

10) The appellant began by adopting his to witness statements at pages  [8]
    to [10] and [51] to [53] of the appellant's bundle ('AB'). I  summarise
    the second  witness  statement  dated  16th  January  2020,  as  it  is
    described as the 'amended' witness  statement  in  virtually  identical
    terms to the first.

11) The appellant claimed to have entered the UK on 15th December 2002  and
    claimed asylum on entry. The respondent refused his protection claim on
    4th February 2003, but he was granted exceptional leave to  remain  for
    four years. He was then granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  27th
    February 2007, after which he obtained citizenship in July 2008.

12) The appellant's citizenship certificate contained his first and  middle
    name but not his 'family' or surname; an incorrect date of birth of 3rd
    April 1982 when his true date of birth was  3rd  March  1980;  and  his
    place  of  birth  as  Kirkuk,   when  his  real  place  of  birth   was
    Sulaymaniyah. He informed the respondent in a letter dated 4th December
    2017 of his correct date of birth which he said had  been  inserted  in
    his paperwork by those who previously represented him  by  mistake.  He
    claimed to have been advised that it would cause  him  problems  if  he
    later sought to rectify the mistake. He accepted that he had signed the
    forms to confirm that the previous details were correct, but  this  was
    based upon trust that those who represented him would  have  accurately
    completed all the paperwork.  He was also  unable  to  speak,  read  or
    write English.

13) He later applied for a deed poll to 'change' his name to his true  name
    and sent this to HM Passport Office. In relation to his place of birth,
    the appellant said that he had lived in Kirkuk since childhood and  had
    always given this as his place of birth.  He disputed lying as  he  had
    never grown up in Sulaymaniyah.  He asserted that his exceptional leave
    to remain was granted based on him being a Kurdish Iraqi and not  based
    on his place of birth.

14) In his oral evidence on cross-examination, the appellant stated that he
    had wanted to correct the inaccurate information which  had  previously
    been provided, which he regarded as being his date of birth, but he was
    advised not to do so and was too scared to do so.  He was told that  if
    he wished to correct the date of birth that he should wait until he got
    his status and then could tell the respondent.

15)  The  appellant  specifically  disputed  the  contents   of   his   own
    representative's letter to the Tribunal, in which they  had  stated  on
    his behalf that he had been advised that on entering the UK, he  should
    not provide his correct personal details, for fear  of  being  returned
    and identified as a non-Arab.  He claimed to have become aware of  this
    statement by his representatives for the first time  in  this  Hearing,
    despite me specifically referring to it in  my  error-of-law  decision,
    over a year ago, at which he was professionally represented.   He  said
    that he was aware of the hearing (which he had not attended) but denied
    knowing that this is what his previous representatives had  stated.  He
    added that he did not regard himself as having given a false  name.  He
    had given his correct first and middle names and had simply  failed  to
    mention his family name.  First and middle names alone were often used.
    It was only when he received documentation from the respondent that  he
    realised that his date of birth was incorrect and his name  missed  out
    his surname, that he was advised not to correct these mistakes  and  he
    became scared.   He  was  aware  at  the  stage  when  he  applied  for
    naturalisation in 2008 that the details provided were not  correct  but
    was too scared to correct them.  Alternatively, the  appellant  claimed
    only to have become aware of his true place of birth at a later stage.

16) The appellant also claimed to be unaware of  the  heightened  level  of
    risk for Kurds in Government Controlled Iraq ('CGI') as opposed to  the
    Kurdish Autonomous Zone ('KAZ') where  he  had  been  born,  under  the
    regime of Saddam Hussain, despite claiming in his asylum  interview  to
    have fled Iraq on being pressured to change his ethnicity, upon claimed
    arrest.  He claimed that there was no difference in risk  then  or  now
    and it was still risky in both areas.  He disputed being aware that  he
    had been born in Sulaymaniyah until he wanted to get married in 2010 in
    Iraq, when he had had to check his birth documents.  Before that, there
    had been no need to know, to engage in normal life. He assumed that  as
    his father had been born in Kirkuk, so had he.  People  often  did  not
    know their family details, such as the names of their grandparents.  He
    had not had a Taskera and had not needed an identity document,  as  his
    life revolved around work and home and he had no access to TV or social
    media in Iraq, before coming to the UK. He denied needing  an  identity
    document even when he was called up for military service for  3  months
    in 2000, as the authorities were not concerned about identity documents
    for compulsorily conscripted soldiers.  He disputed ever  having  known
    of a family registration book and disputed that the reason why  he  had
    said in his witness statement, supporting his asylum claim, at Annex  D
    of the respondent's bundle, that his father had been  born  in  Kirkuk,
    was to bolster his claim.  When he had referred at �[3] of that witness
    statement to being born in a specific  district  of  Kirkuk,  the  Imam
    Kasim district, whereas he had been born in an entirely different city,
    he denied attempting to mislead the respondent.  He  accepted  that  he
    had later repeated incorrect information in his  2008  application  for
    naturalisation, knowing it to be incorrect, because he was  too  scared
    to correct the inaccuracies, although he later sought to assert that he
    had only known that his date of birth was incorrect.

Closing submissions

The respondent

17) The respondent relied on her deprivation decision.  She had established
    a chain of causation, specifically that had the respondent known of the
    respondent's true name, date of birth and crucially where he came from,
    she would  not  have  granted  him  exceptional  leave  to  remain  and
    consequently he would not have obtained  indefinite  leave  to  remain.
    Moreover,  in  his  application  for  naturalisation,  he  had  clearly
    included materially  false  representations,  in  the  sense  that  the
    representations had directly affected the grant of British citizenship.



18) Whilst the appellant now claimed to be entirely unaware that his former
    solicitors had admitted in his appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    2019 that the appellant  had  deliberately  attempted  to  mislead  the
    respondent as early as his asylum application in 2003, his claimed lack
    of ignorance was not credible, bearing in mind  that  I  had  expressly
    referred to this in my error-of-law decision, in writing, a  year  ago.
    There were further credibility issues.  First, the appellant's  claimed
    ignorance that there was a difference in risk between the GCI  and  KAZ
    areas of Iraq been referred to expressly in the  respondent's  decision
    refusing the appellant's asylum claim at page [D] of  the  respondent's
    bundle, dated 4th February 2003, at �[6], which  had  referred  to  the
    'Arabisation' policy of forcibly removing the non-Arab  population,  in
    particular from oil rich regions such as Kirkuk.  In simple terms,  one
    would expect anyone living in the country at the time to  be  aware  of
    the oppression of the Kurdish peoples within GCI, where he  claimed  to
    live, in contrast to the KAZ area.

19) Similarly, the appellant's claim to be unaware of the need for  a  CSID
    or identity card was also not credible, noting the bureaucratic  nature
    of Iraq, which this Tribunal had recognised  in  the  Country  Guidance
    case of SMO, KSP & IM  (Article  15(c);  identity  documents)  Iraq  CG
    [2019]  UKUT  00400  (IAC)  at  �[336].   Even  if  that  guidance  had
    considered the situation more recently, there was no reason to  suggest
    that the appellant's assertion that he would not need a  CSID  card  or
    something of that nature, during the  time  of  the  regime  of  Saddam
    Hussein, an authoritarian dictator,  was plausible.  What was clear, at
    ��[13] and [14] of SMO was that  there  was  a  patrilineal  system  of
    registration and a family book  where  people  needed  to  be  able  to
    identify where their birth had been registered.  If the appellant  knew
    that his father and mother were born in different  places  (his  mother
    was born in Sulaymaniyah), he would similarly have known where  he  had
    his place of birth was.  Even on his own account he knew he  was  being
    dishonest in his application for naturalisation,  noting  that  he  had
    deliberately concealed his earlier inaccurate statement as to his  date
    of birth because he feared being returned to Iraq.

20) In terms of the respondent's "exceptional leave to remain policy",  the
    appellant had claimed asylum in 2002 and was granted exceptional  leave
    to remain on 4th February 2003, a month before the US invasion, so  the
    policy was as reflected in the  Operational  Guidance  Note.   The  OGN
    referred to the respondent having discretion but focussed on  risks  to
    non-Arabs in GCI. As a non-Arab from the KAZ,  which  was  regarded  as
    safe for Kurds, these different, true circumstances would  have  had  a
    direct impact on the decision to grant the appellant exceptional  leave
    to remain.

21) Returning to the case of fraud, the appellant, in his  application  for
    naturalisation, had used a partial name, false date of birth and  false
    place of birth and in particular at paragraph [3.12] of the application
    form, the appellant confirmed that he was a person of  good  character.
    Had she  known  of  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  intentionally
    reconfirmed incorrect details, it was likely that the respondent  would
    not have regarded the appellant as being a person of good character and
    in that regard, I was referred to the 'nullification'  policy,  chapter
    [55], � [55.7] and the 'good  character'  guidance  applicable  at  the
    time, �� [2.1], [9.1] and [9.2].

Closing submissions of the appellant

22) The starting point was to go back to  the  2003  grant  of  exceptional
    leave  to  remain.   Whilst  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  had  been
    dismissed because his  credibility  was  not  accepted,  based  on  the
    information that he had provided, he was  given  exceptional  leave  to
    remain.  Crucially, as reflected in the case of Rashid  v  SSHD  [2008]
    EWHC 232 (Admin),  at  ��  [13]  to  [15],  those  who  had  left  Iraq
    illegally, regardless of where in Iraq they came from,  were  typically
    granted exceptional leave to remain, prior to the US invasion.  Even if
    the appellant had lied about his place of birth, had he  said  that  he
    was from the KAZ, he would still have been granted exceptional leave to
    remain.

23) The appellant had given  incorrect  information,  but  had,  until  his
    marriage in 2010 (after he applied for naturalisation) believed he  was
    from  Kirkuk.    Considering  the  respondent's  guidance  on  nullity,
    chapter 55, �[55.7] and in particular subparagraphs  [7.3]  and  [7.4],
    even where someone had lied  about  their  asylum  claim,  unless  they
    concealed criminality, it would not have been material to the grant  of
    indefinite leave to remain or citizenship.  The appellant had  given  a
    plausible explanation that whilst he had  not  corrected  his  date  of
    birth, he had not intentionally  given  a  false  place  of  birth  and
    crucially, he had not concealed any criminality.  It was also dangerous
    to rely on the authority of SMO which was more recent  guidance  as  to
    whether the appellant was likely to have used  a  CSID  card  or  other
    identification. The CSID at page [J] of  the  respondent's  bundle  was
    dated May 2015, which was consistent with his assertion that he had not
    used one prior to returning to Iraq.

24)  When  asked  about  the  position  regarding  the  appellant's  former
    solicitors  and  their  assertions  as  to  the  appellant's   apparent
    agreement that he had deliberately provided false information,  without
    making any criticism at all of Mr Haq, Mr Haq indicated that  he  could
    not provide an explanation.  When asked, he accepted  that  no  attempt
    had been made to take a statement from the  former  solicitor  who  had
    completed a statement of truth in the grounds of appeal.

The Law

25) Section 40 of the British Nationality Act 1981 provides:

         "(3) The Secretary of State may by order  deprive  a  person  of  a
         citizenship  status  which  results  from   his   registration   or
         naturalisation if the Secretary of  State  is  satisfied  that  the
         registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of-

             (a)  fraud,

             (b)  false representation, or

             (c)  concealment of a material fact."

26) In  relation  to  what  is  meant  by  dishonesty,  the  Supreme  Court
    considered this in a gambling context  (and  the  use  of  a  technique
    called  "edge-sorting")  in   Ivey  v  Genting  Casinos  (UK)  Ltd  t/a
    Crockfords [2017] UKSC 67.  It confirmed the test, at �74, as follows:

         "74. These several considerations provide  convincing  grounds  for
         holding that the second leg of the test propounded  in  Ghosh  does
         not correctly represent the law and that directions based  upon  it
         ought no longer to be given. The test of dishonesty is as  set  out
         by Lord Nicholls in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan and by Lord
         Hoffmann in Barlow Clowes: see para 62 above. When dishonesty is in
         question   the   fact-finding   tribunal   must   first   ascertain
         (subjectively) the actual state of the  individual's  knowledge  or
         belief as to the facts. The  reasonableness  or  otherwise  of  his
         belief is a matter of evidence (often  in  practice  determinative)
         going to whether he held the belief, but it is  not  an  additional
         requirement that his belief must be  reasonable;  the  question  is
         whether it is genuinely held. When once his actual state of mind as
         to knowledge or belief as to facts  is  established,  the  question
         whether his conduct was honest or dishonest is to be determined  by
         the fact-finder by applying the (objective) standards  of  ordinary
         decent people. There is no  requirement  that  the  defendant  must
         appreciate  that  what  he  has  done  is,  by   those   standards,
         dishonest."

27) In the reported case of Sleiman (deprivation of  citizenship;  conduct)
    [2017] UKUT 00367 (IAC), Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek  confirmed  the
    following proposition:

         "In an  appeal  against  a  decision  to  deprive  a  person  of  a
         citizenship status, in assessing  whether  the  appellant  obtained
         registration  or  naturalisation  "by  means   of"   fraud,   false
         representation, or concealment of a  material  fact,  the  impugned
         behaviour must be  directly  material  to  the  decision  to  grant
         citizenship."

28) Judge Kopieczek made the point that  the  impugned  behaviour  must  be
    directly material, as opposed to indirectly material, and on the  facts
    of that case, the appellant's  misrepresentation  as  to  his  age  (he
    claimed to have been a minor when entering the  UK)  was  not  directly
    material.

29) In the context of causation, I considered the respondent's  Operational
    Guidance Note or "OGN' dated October 2002, in force at  the  time  that
    the appellant claimed asylum.  The relevant excerpts are as follows:

         "Non-Arabs from the Kurdish Autonomous Zone

         Claims from ordinary Kurds who come  from  the  Kurdish  Autonomous
         Zone, on the  basis  that  they  are  being  persecuted  by  Saddam
         Hussein's Government or because of their membership of one  of  the
         Kurdish  political  parties,  are  unlikely  to  engage  the   UK's
         obligations under the 1951 UN  Convention.  Saddam  Hussein  leaves
         control of the KAZ largely to the Kurdish political parties.

         Saddam's spies do infiltrate the KAZ but would normally only target
         high profile opponents. As previously noted, the KDP  and  the  PUK
         each control their own areas within the KAZ, and although there has
         been conflict between the PUK and KDP  in  the  past,  that  is  no
         longer the case.  Relations between the two parties  have  improved
         in recent years and they are now working closely with  each  other.
         The PUK and KDP have convened a joint Parliament that  now  appears
         to be fully functional. In the light of the Maghdeed  determination
         referred to above, caseworkers should no longer  argue  that  if  a
         Kurd experiences difficulties with one of the two parties, then  it
         is possible for them to move to the area controlled  by  the  other
         party......

         C. In all cases where the caseworker has decided that asylum should
         not be granted, the caseworker  must  go  on  to  consider  whether
         exceptional  leave  to  remain  (ELR)  is  appropriate  to  provide
         protection for reasons outside the scope of the 1951 UN  Convention
         or  for  individual  humanitarian  or  compassionate  reasons.   In
         considering individual claims based on the  following,  caseworkers
         may consider  it  appropriate  to  grant  ELR.  This  list  is  not
         exhaustive.

         Consequences of illegal departure from government-controlled Iraq

         In an apparent effort to convince citizens living abroad to  return
         to the country, government radio announced in June 1999 an  amnesty
         for teachers who left the country illegally  after  the  Gulf  War.
         Shortly thereafter the  Revolutionary  Command  Council  decreed  a
         general amnesty for all citizens who either had  left  the  country
         illegally or who had failed to return after the period of exile had
         expired.  In  October  1999,  Justice  Minster   Shabib   Al-Maliki
         announced that authorities may seize assets belonging  to  citizens
         living outside the country who did not return in  response  to  the
         amnesty decree. A special ministerial committee was formed to track
         and monitor citizens inside the country  who  received  money  from
         relatives  living  abroad.  A  November  1999  law   provides   for
         additional penalties for citizens who attempt to leave the  country
         illegally. Under the law, a prison term  of  up  to  10  years  and
         "confiscation of movable and immovable property" is to  be  imposed
         on anyone who attempts to leave illegally. Similar  penalties  face
         anyone found to encourage or assist  persons  banned  from  travel,
         including health  care  professionals,  engineers,  and  university
         professors. In 2000 the director of the  Real  Estate  Registration
         Department stated that  pursuant  to  the  decree,  the  Government
         confiscated the property of a number  of  persons.  The  Government
         severely  restricts  foreign  travel   by   journalists,   authors,
         university professors, doctors, scientists, and  all  employees  of
         the Ministry of Information. Security authorities  interrogate  all
         media employees, journalists, and writers upon  their  return  from
         foreign travel.

         The  UK  endorses  UNHCR's  position  on  returns  to   government-
         controlled Iraq which is that "... the

         return  of  rejected  Iraqi  asylum  seekers  to   the   Government
         controlled areas of  Iraq  should  be  voluntary.  Forced  returns,
         especially from western countries, may result in arrest,  detention
         and possibly in degrading and inhuman treatment."

         Non-Arabs from government-controlled Iraq

         There  are  reports  that  since  2001  the  Iraqi  government  has
         accelerated its ethnic cleansing campaign  (Arabisation  Programme)
         against the country's non-Arab citizens particularly in Iraq's main
         oil producing province, Kirkuk, and the other predominantly Kurdish
         districts of  Khanaqin  and  Sinjar  at  the  edge  of  government-
         controlled Iraq near the KAZ.  Security forces demand that a family
         change its ethnicity from "Kurdish" or "Turkoman" to "Arab". Non  -
         Arabs are being evicted from the area and forced  to  move  to  the
         KAZ. According to the US Committee for Refugees,  the  majority  of
         those displaced in this way remain  in  the  KAZ  where  they  have
         relatives or the support of persons sharing the same  language  and
         culture.

         There is generally free travel for  non-Arabs  between  government-
         controlled Iraq and the KAZ and the authorities there will,  except
         in the case of high-profile opponents of the Iraqi  government,  be
         both  able  and  willing  to  provide  adequate   protection.   The
         authorities in the KAZ have however made it clear that  they  would
         only re-admit to the territory they control those who can show that
         they were previously resident  there.  Internal  flight  for  other
         Iraqis to the KAZ is not therefore a viable option."

30) I also considered the following guidance applied by the  respondent  in
    relation to nullity, chapter 55:

         55.7 Material to the Acquisition of Citizenship

         55.7.1 If the relevant facts, had they been known at the  time  the
         application for citizenship was   considered, would  have  affected
         the  decision  to   grant   citizenship   via   naturalisation   or
         registration the caseworker should consider deprivation.

         55.7.2 This will include but is not limited to:

         .    Undisclosed convictions or other information which would  have
              affected   a   person's   ability   to    meet    the    good
             character requirement

         .    A marriage/civil partnership which is found to be  invalid  or
             void, and so would have affected a person's  ability  to  meet
             the requirements for section 6(2)

         .    False details given in relation to an  immigration  or  asylum
             application,  which  led  to  that  status  being   given   to
             a  person  who  would  not  otherwise  have   qualified,   and
             so  would   have    affected    a    person's    ability    to
             meet    the     residence      and/or      good      character
             requirements    for    naturalisation or registration

         55.7.3  If  the  fraud,  false  representation  or  concealment  of
         material fact did not  have  a  direct  bearing  on  the  grant  of
         citizenship, it will  not  be  appropriate  to  pursue  deprivation
         action.

         55.7.4 For example, where a person acquires ILR under a  concession
         (e.g. the family ILR concession) the fact that we  could  show  the
         person  had  previously  lied  about  their  asylum  claim  may  be
         irrelevant.  Similarly a person may use a different  name  if  they
         wish (see NAMES in the General Information section of Volume  2  of
         the Staff Instructions): unless it conceals criminality,  or  other
         information relevant to an assessment of their good  character,  or
         immigration history in another identity it is not material  to  the
         acquisition of  ILR  or  citizenship.   However,  before  making  a
         decision not to deprive, the caseworker should ensure that relevant
         character checks are undertaken in relation to the  subject's  true
         identity to  ensure  that  the  false   information   provided   to
         the  Home  Office was not used  to  conceal  criminality  or  other
         information relevant to an assessment of their character."

31) Annex D to Chapter 18 of the respondent's "good character" guidance for
    naturalisation applications at the time stated:

         "2. Aspects of the requirement

         2.1 We would  not  normally  consider  applicants  to  be  of  good
         character if, for example, there was information to suggest:

         .    they did not respect and were not prepared to abide by the law
             (i.e., were, or were suspected of being,  involved  in  crime)
             (see paragraphs 3 and 4); or

         .    their financial affairs were not in order (e.g. failure to pay
             taxes for which they were liable) (see paragraph 6); or

         .    their activities were notorious, and  cast  serious  doubt  on
             their standing in the local community (see paragraph 7); or

         .    they had practised deceit, for example, in their dealings with
             the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or  HM
             Revenue & Customs (see paragraphs 6 and 8); or

         .    they had assisted in the evasion of immigration  control  (see
             paragraph 9) ...

         9. Deception

         9.1 It should count  heavily  against  an  applicant  who  lies  or
         attempts to conceal the truth about an aspect  of  the  application
         for naturalisation - whether on the  application  form  or  in  the
         course  of  enquiries.  Concealment  of  information  or  lack   of
         frankness in any matter  must  raise  doubt  about  an  applicant's
         truthfulness in other matters.

         9.2 We should take into account the intentions of any  concealment.
         If it is on a minor matter, not    relevant to the decision, it may
         be overlooked.  If it relates to a criminal conviction,  we  should
         only be prepared to  overlook  the  deception  if  there  are  good
         reasons which we accept as genuine - such as a misunderstanding  of
         the  effect  of  the  Rehabilitation  of  Offenders  Act  or   that
         applicants have good reasons for not wishing to disclose their past
         to someone, such as a referee or a spouse/civil partner, who  would
         see the application form, and the applicant is  open  at  interview
         and  otherwise  suitable  for  naturalisation.   However,  if   the
         deception is serious and deliberate, particularly if the  applicant
         did not co-operate in our enquiries, or if it contributes to  other
         doubts about the decision, then the application should normally  be
         refused. For guidance on how to deal with  applications  where  the
         applicant has failed to declare an impending prosecution please see
         paragraphs 3.7.6 above."

32) Finally, I was referred to, and considered the authority of Rashid,  in
    relation to the application of the Exceptional Leave policy at the time
    of the appellant's application:

         "11. The Policy background.     Iraqi asylum seekers from  northern
             Iraq - in particular those of Kurdish ethnicity -  who  had  a
             well-founded fear of persecution in the area of Iraq  formally
             under the control of Saddam Hussein ("the  GCA"),  might  well
             have had no such fear in the  Kurdish  Autonomous  Zone  ("the
             KAZ") even when Saddam Hussein was in  power.   However,  from
             around 1991 onwards, the Secretary of State had a  policy  not
             to argue that individuals from the GCA could relocate  to  the
             KAZ in order to seek protection from Saddam  Hussein's  regime
             as a reason for denying them  refugee  status,  i.e.  the  KAZ
             Policy.

         12.  The background to and origins of the KAZ policy were explained
             in the Secretary of State's evidence in the case of A,H &  AH.
             For the reasons explained in that case the KAZ policy had  not
             been adequately disseminated within IND whilst  it  was  still
             applicable.

         13.  However, from 20th March 2003, following military intervention
             in Iraq and the removal  of  Saddam  Hussein  and  the  Ba'ath
             regime from power, the KAZ policy came to an  end  because  it
             was redundant.  In short, there was no  longer  any  issue  of
             internal relocation away from the GCA to the KAZ  once  Saddam
             Hussein's regime in the GCA had been removed.

         14.  In addition to the KAZ policy, there had also been a policy in
             place until the fall of Saddam  Hussein  in  relation  to  the
             Secretary of State's grant  of  ELR  to  Iraqi  failed  asylum
             seekers, i.e. the ELR policy.

         15.  Under the ELR policy, those individuals from Iraq whose claims
             for refugee status had been refused were, with few exceptions,
             granted ELR.  Primarily, this was because of the Secretary  of
             State's recognition of the severe penalties imposed by  Saddam
             Hussein's regime on those who had left Iraq illegally."

Findings of fact

33) The representatives agreed that in line with Ivey, it is necessary  for
    me to consider  what  was  in  the  mind  of  the  appellant  and  also
    objectively, whether his conduct was dishonest.  The claimed dishonesty
    is  in  relation  to  three  aspects;   misrepresentation   about   the
    appellant's date of birth; his name; and his place of  birth.   On  the
    one hand, the appellant says that  the  date  of  birth  was  initially
    recorded incorrectly because he had relied upon a solicitor to complete
    the form. The solicitor had done so incorrectly, and the appellant  was
    of limited education, unable to read, write or speak English.  His  use
    only of his first  and  middle  name,  omitting  his  family  name  was
    explained because a mixture of names could be used. The incorrect place
    of birth was explained because he genuinely believed that his place  of
    birth had been Kirkuk and there was no need for him to have had a  CSID
    or other ID before he had left Iraq in 2002, given his limited life  at
    the time, which revolved around his work and family.

34) Having considered all of that evidence in the round, I  find  that  the
    respondent has shown that the appellant was dishonest, when he  claimed
    asylum in 2002; when he applied for ILR;  and  in  2008,  when  he  had
    applied for British naturalisation. I find him to have been  dishonest,
    in the sense that he knew at each of these times what his true place of
    birth was; his true date of birth; and  his  true  full  name;  and  he
    intentionally provided misleading information in relation to all  three
    on each occasion. In making these findings, of critical  importance,  I
    have considered the application to the First-tier Tribunal made by  the
    appellant's former solicitors, dated 10th June 2019, a copy of which is
    in the final part of the respondent's bundle.  The appeal was completed
    and signed by Mr Naeem Baig, a solicitor, of Lei Dat & Baig Solicitors.
    The declaration which Mr Baig signed stated that:

         "I, the representative, am giving notice of  appeal  in  accordance
         with the appellant's instructions and the appellant  believes  that
         the facts stated in this appeal form are true".

35) The grounds of appeal continue at ��[6] and [7] that the appellant  was
    brought to the UK by an agent, and with the information given to him by
    those who he lived with and travelled and he:

         "was told  not  to  provide  full  correct  details,  otherwise  if
         detected and returned back to Iraq it is very likely that he  would
         be easily detected and found to be a non-Arab  Iraqi  i.e.  Kurdish
         national, and due to his well-founded fear of persecution, resorted
         to providing incorrect data."

36) �[7] continued:

         "Therefore, he continued to give details that were slightly not  in
         accordance with his correct details.  He accepts that his  date  of
         birth was incorrect and his place of birth  was  Sulaymaniyah,  but
         because he lived in Kirkuk he gave this as his place of birth."

37) The appellant asserts that he was entirely unaware of this issue  until
    having been  raised  in  cross-examination  by  Mr  Clarke  before  me.
    However, I do not regard this as a plausible explanation  noting  that,
    not least, I specifically raised the point in the error-of-law decision
    in �[11], annexed to this decision, and the appellant  was  represented
    at that hearing.  More importantly  and  without  an  explanation,  the
    statement of truth which has been attested to by his then-solicitor, Mr
    Baig, is not one  in  which  there  has  been  any  subsequent  witness
    statement, for example suggesting a misunderstanding  of  instructions.
    In other words, there is a signed notice by a solicitor,  attesting  to
    the appellant's belief in the stated grounds, for which a  there  is  a
    specific explanation as to why the appellant intentionally mislead  the
    respondent, on advice from those he was  travelling  with  to  the  UK,
    which is entirely inconsistent with  the  appellant's  current  claimed
    ignorance. There is simply no explanation for that inconsistency and no
    explanation for why evidence, which could have  been  readily  adduced,
    namely a witness  statement  from  Mr  Baig  as  to  any  confusion  on
    instructions, has not been provided.

38) I also regard it as telling and it undermines the appellant's assertion
    that he was unaware of the difference in level of risk between the  KAZ
    region and GCI, that paragraph [6] seems to  reflect  a  difference  in
    risk of return.  In other words, if he was returned to Iraq it was very
    likely that he would be easily detected and  found  to  be  a  non-Arab
    Iraqi i.e., of Kurdish ethnic origin, in GCI, as opposed to the KAZ.

39) Whilst it is possible (just) that the appellant's lack of the use of  a
    GCID card is not inconsistent with SMO, which  is  a  far  more  recent
    authority, Mr Haq realistically accepted  that  there  was  nothing  in
    support of the appellant's contention, beyond his oral assertion,  that
    ID documents were not regarded as a necessary normal part of  life,  in
    pre-2002 Iraq, during the regime of Saddam Hussein.  Moreover, it  does
    not begin to explain the major inconsistency in the correspondence from
    Mr Baig.  The obvious explanation for Mr Baig's correspondence is  that
    its contents are in fact accurate and the appellant intentionally  gave
    a dishonest date of birth, partial name and place of birth being Kirkuk
    in CGI, as opposed to Sulaymaniyah in the KAZ.  Even on the appellant's
    own  account,  by  the  later  date  of  2008  when  he   applied   for
    naturalisation,  he  was  aware,  albeit  I  find  that  he  was  aware
    substantially earlier, that the date of birth was incorrect and he  was
    inconsistent in his own evidence before me about  inaccuracies  in  the
    remainder of the details.

40) Considering further the appellant's application for  naturalisation  in
    2008, when he completed the part of the form at box [3.12], which asked
    whether he had engaged in any other  activities  which  might  indicate
    that he may not be considered a person of  good  character,  he  ticked
    "No."  I am satisfied that the appellant knew at the  time,  not  least
    because he was deliberately including incorrect  information  in  other
    parts of the form (his full name, date of birth  and  place  of  birth)
    that he also knew that the respondent might consider  these  activities
    as indicating that he  was  not  of  good  character.  The  appellant's
    deliberate misstatements were, at each stage, to achieve his  end  goal
    of naturalisation: when he applied for  asylum;  when  he  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain; and when he applied for naturalisation.

41) I considered the appellant's contention that even  had  his  true  full
    name, date of birth and place of birth been known, he would  have  been
    granted exceptional  leave  to  remain,  in  light  of  the  policy  as
    discussed by  the  High  Court  in  Rashid,  above.   I  did  so,  also
    considering the OGN, to  which  I  have  also  referred.  While  Rashid
    refers, at �[15], to people from Iraq whose claims for  refugee  status
    had been refused were, with few exceptions, granted ELR, I  noted  that
    was not without exception.  Moreover,  the  OGN  clearly  distinguishes
    between 'Non-Arabs' (i.e. those of Kurdish ethnic origin) from the KAZ;
    those GCI; and the KAZ  authorities'  willingness  to  admit  those  of
    Kurdish ethnic origin to the KAZ.   It  also  includes  (regardless  of
    ethnicity), the section on those who had illegally left CGI  illegally,
    and rejects the idea of forced returns to GCI.  It does  not,  however,
    suggest that there could not be returns to the KAZ for those of Kurdish
    ethnic origin who were from the KAZ or with  connections  to  the  KAZ.
    While the appellant continues to assert that regardless of his place of
    birth, he was brought up in CGI and suffered  adverse  interest  there,
    the respondent rejected his account in her  decision  of  4th  February
    2003.  Had the respondent known of the appellant's true place of  birth
    and possible continuing connections to the KAZ  at  the  time  she  was
    considering granting him exceptional  leave  to  remain,  I  find  that
    instead, the  respondent  would  have  given  active  consideration  to
    returning the appellant to the KAZ, which Rashid does not rule out  and
    which is consistent with the  OGN,  which  has  whole  sections  of  it
    (relating to the discussion about those from the  KAZ  and  those  from
    GCI) which would otherwise be redundant. I find  that  the  appellant's
    concealment of his relevant  details  was  directly  material,  in  the
    'Sleiman' sense, to the grant of ELR and subsequent ILR.

42) I considered finally Mr Haq's suggestion  that  in  the  naturalisation
    application, the appellant would not have failed the  "good  character"
    test, because, by  reference  to  Chapter  55,  he  had  not  concealed
    criminality, and the guidance, particularly  at  �  [55.7.4]  indicates
    that those who had  lied  about  their  circumstances  might  still  be
    granted British nationality. However, I accept Mr  Clarke's  submission
    that while someone may have lied in their asylum claim more  generally,
    there may have  been  a  different  route  to  settlement,  such  as  a
    concession in relation to family life and  they  might  still  then  be
    granted citizenship.  Where, as here, the very basis for the  grant  of
    ELR was on the basis of false details, that would be  material  to  the
    grant of citizenship, as anticipated in �[55.7.2] and  consistent  with
    serious and deliberate deception as outlined in �[9.2] of  Annex  D  of
    Chapter 18, cited above. Such  deception  is  clearly  not  limited  to
    concealment of criminal convictions.

43) In summary, I find that the respondent has shown that the appellant was
    subjectively dishonest at each stage of  his  application  for  status;
    that his conduct was, by objective standards, dishonest; and  that  the
    conduct was directly material at each stage to the grant of  ELR;  ILR;
    and British Citizenship. I conclude that the  respondent  was,  in  the
    circumstances,  entitled  to  deprive  the  appellant  of  his  British
    citizenship. The representatives agreed before me that  no  appeal  was
    pursued on wider human rights grounds.





Decision

44) The appellant's appeal against the deprivation of his citizenship fails
    and is dismissed.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. These are a written record of the oral reasons given for my decision at
    the hearing.

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant, who was the respondent  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, and who I will refer to as the Secretary of State.
     The respondent was the appellant before the First-tier  Tribunal,  and
    to avoid  confusion,  I  will  refer  to  him  as  the  Claimant.   The
    Secretary of State appeals against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Borsada (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 5 August 2019,  by  which  he
    allowed the Claimant's appeal against the decision by the Secretary  of
    State dated 29 May 2019 (the 'Decision') to deprive him of his acquired
    British  citizenship,  pursuant  to  section  40(3)  of   the   British
    Nationality Act 1981.  The gist of the Decision was that the  Claimant,
    originally an Iraqi national, had obtained exceptional leave to  remain
    (February 2003), followed by further leave to  remain  (February  2007)
    and naturalisation as a British citizen (July 2008)  In  doing  so,  at
    each stage he  confirmed  his  place  of  birth  as  being  Kirkuk,  in
    Government-controlled Iraq ('CGI'), as opposed to  his  true  place  of
    birth, Sulaimaniya, in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone  ('KAZ').   He  only
    revealed this when he  applied  for  passports  for  his  children  and
    enclosed documents in 2018, disclosing  his  true  date  and  place  of
    birth.   In response to correspondence  from  the  Secretary  of  State
    dated 23 August 2018 that she was  considering  depriving  him  of  his
    citizenship, the Claimant's representatives replied on  10th  September
    2018, asserting that a date of birth in his 'paperwork' was added by  a
    representative, and he had limited English and was later told  that  it
    would 'cause too many problems  to  rectify  the  mistake',  while  the
    incorrect place of birth was explicable because he had been brought  up
    for most of his life in Kirkuk.  The Claimant disputed that he had been
    dishonest.

 3. Following the Claimant's representations, the Secretary of  State  made
    the Decision, concluding that the Claimant  had  obtained  initial  and
    subsequent periods of leave and naturalisation on the basis  of  fraud.
    The Secretary of State noted that  prior  to  his  naturalisation,  the
    Claimant had stated his real place of birth in a  marriage  certificate
    issued in  the  KAZ,  in  contrast  to  the  details  provided  in  his
    application for naturalisation.

The FtT's decision

 4. Of note, in his appeal  to  the  FtT,  the  Claimant's  representatives
    wrote, in grounds of appeal dated 12 June 2019, ([6]) that he was  told
    'by those he lived with and travelled with not to provide full  correct
    details otherwise if detected and returned back  to  Iraq  it  is  very
    likely that he would be easily detected and  found  to  be  a  non-Arab
    Iraqi.'

 5. Neither the Claimant nor his representatives attending the FtT  hearing
    and the FtT based his findings and conclusions on the written  evidence
    and submissions from the Presenting Officer.  The FtT noted  that  fear
    of persecution had led the  Claimant  to  provide  "slightly  incorrect
    information", i.e., an incorrect date and  place  of  birth.   The  FtT
    concluded that it was not clear what advantage the Claimant would  gain
    and he had provided cogent reasons for the 'mistakes'  ([6]).  She  was
    not satisfied that the Secretary of State had proved dishonesty.  There
    was not sufficient evidence that Iraqi Kurds from the KAZ as opposed to
    the CGI would have been returned ([7]), which would  have  resulted  in
    exceptional leave having been refused.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The Secretary of State lodged grounds of appeal which  are  essentially
    that the FtT had taken the Claimant at his word  about  his  assertions
    that he had not  been  dishonest,  and  failed  to  consider  what  the
    Claimant had said in his asylum interview about  his  place  of  birth.
    Even  if  he  had  a  motive  for  being  dishonest,  namely  fear   of
    persecution, that did not prevent there from being dishonesty.

 7. Upper Tribunal Judge Martin, sitting as a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
    granted permission for the Secretary of State to appeal, on  the  basis
    that it was arguable that the FtT had taken the Claimant at  his  word,
    and had placed too much weight on  untested  evidence.   The  grant  of
    permission was not limited in its scope.

The hearing before me

The Secretary of State's representations

 8. Mrs Aboni asserted that the FtT's assessment in relation to whether the
    Claimant had been dishonest was clearly insufficient,  particularly  in
    light of the Claimant's representative's correspondence.  The  FtT  had
    indeed simply taken the  Claimant  at  his  word.   This  was  material
    because if  the  respondent  had  been  aware  that  the  Claimant  was
    advancing a false identity then this would have affected  the  decision
    to grant exceptional leave to remain.  Because the  respondent  was  in
    ignorance of the Claimant's true identity and place of birth,  she  had
    been unable to make an informed assessment.  That was why the deception
    was material to the grant of leave to the Claimant.

The Claimant's representations

 9. Mr Haq submitted that the FtT had correctly identified that the  burden
    of proof on deception rested on the Secretary of State, which  she  had
    failed to discharge.  The Claimant had grown up in Kirkuk and he  would
    have got exceptional leave regardless of growing up either in Kirkuk or
    in the area of the KAZ.  I discussed with Mr Haq  the  provision  of  a
    Country Policy Bulletin produced by the Secretary of State dated  2009,
    and in particular paragraph [3.6] which stated:

         "From 20 October 2000, in light of the improved conditions in  KAZ,
         only claimants who were accepted to have come from GCA were granted
         four years ELR."

10. Mr Haq invited me to consider that the Claimant was  from  the  GCI  as
    although he had been born in Sulaimaniya he lived in Kirkuk.   The  FtT
    had  considered,  and  answered  the  questions   of   dishonesty   and
    materiality.  He referred me to the well-known authority in relation to
    the requirement that dishonesty  or  the  impugned  behaviour  must  be
    directly material to the decision  to  grant  citizenship,  namely  the
    decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  Kopieczek  in  the  case  of  Sleiman
    (deprivation of citizenship;  conduct)  [2017]  UKUT  00367  (IAC).   I
    canvassed with Mr Haq  whether  the  conclusion  in  that  case,  which
    related solely to an incorrect age might be distinguished on the  basis
    that certain concessions or lack of arguments had been advanced by  the
    Home Office in that case. In particular, the Secretary of State had not
    argued  that  an  incorrect  age  had  led  to  the  grant  of  British
    citizenship, whereas here, the combination of incorrect age  and  place
    of birth were potentially relevant to  whether  a  false  identity  was
    being advanced  Mr Haq reiterated that Sleiman was authority before the
    proposition that there had to be direct causation between the deception
    and the grant of citizenship and the FtT had bee entitled  to  conclude
    that there was no such causation here.

Discussion and conclusions

11. There were two issues before  the  FtT.   The  first  was  whether  the
    Claimant had been dishonest. The second was whether, if  he  was,  this
    was material to the grant initially of exceptional leave to remain  and
    a subsequent grant of naturalisation.  In relation to the  question  of
    dishonesty, I conclude that the FtT's reasoning was inadequate.  First,
    in the Claimant's grounds of appeal to the FtT, there  was  an  express
    reference to the Claimant  being  told  by  those  he  lived  with  and
    travelled with not to provide  'full  correct  details',  otherwise  he
    would have been detected and  returned  back  to  Iraq.   There  is  no
    consideration by the FtT of how this is reconcilable to the  Claimant's
    explanations for the mistakes over his place and date  of  birth  being
    entirely innocent. The FtT refers at paragraph 4(iii) to the Claimant's
    contention that it was fear of persecution that led  to  his  providing
    'incorrect data' and that he  therefore  continued  to  give  "slightly
    incorrect information".  The FtT did not explain  why  this  would  not
    constitute dishonesty, even if the motivation for that  dishonesty  was
    understandable.  Effectively, the FtT has erred in  law  in  conflating
    the motives around dishonesty, which might be understandable, with  the
    issue of whether the Claimant had  been  dishonest  and  his  reasoning
    about the lack of dishonesty was not adequate.

12. Dealing with the second issue of material causation, the FtT dealt with
    this briefly at paragraph [7], referring to searching in  vain  amongst
    documents provided by the Secretary of State about her  policy  at  the
    time in respect of grants of exceptional leave to remain.  He added:-

         "It is not clear to me therefore that even  if  there  was  such  a
         policy in place in 2003 that it was  specifically  applied  to  the
         appellant's case and  represents  the  reasons  for  the  grant  of
         exceptional leave.  This in my view is a vital and necessary  piece
         of evidence and its absence means that the respondent has  not  met
         the burden or standard of proof in this regard."

13. While the FtT was not referred to it, I conclude that the FtT erred  in
    failing to consider the authority of Rashid  v  SSHD  [2008]  EWHC  232
    (Admin), and background material referenced in that case,  which  deals
    at least in part with the background to the Secretary of State's policy
    on how she treated individuals seeking assistance from the GCI.

14. The lack  of  consideration  of  Rashid,  together  with  the  lack  of
    consideration of the effect of advancing a false identity,  as  opposed
    to merely a false age, did amount to an error of law by the FtT when he
    considered the causation between the alleged deception and the grant of
    exceptional leave to remain and subsequent British citizenship.



Decision on error of law

15. In the circumstances, I conclude that the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal contains an error of law, such that it is not safe and  cannot
    stand. I therefore set it aside without  preservation  of  findings  of
    fact.

Remaking and adjournment

16. Given the narrowness of the  factual  issues  between  the  parties,  I
    regarded it as appropriate and  in  accordance  paragraph  7.2  of  the
    Senior President's Practice Statements that the Upper Tribunal  remakes
    the decision on the Claimant's appeal.

17. However,  Mr  Haq  informed  me  that  the  Claimant  is  currently  in
    Sulaimaniya and unable to leave Iraq because the authorities there will
    not permit him to do so as there is a discrepancy between the date  and
    place of birth in his British biometric details and his Iraqi passport.
     It is unclear when he will be able to return to  the  UK  but  Mr  Haq
    accepted that the remaking cannot be postponed indefinitely, so he will
    need to  make  arrangements  for  any  remaking  hearing,  and  seek  a
    variation to the directions, where he deems necessary.

18. The resumed remaking decision will be listed before the Upper  Tribunal
    on the first available date after 9 March 2020, time estimate 3  hours,
    to enable the Upper Tribunal to substitute a decision to  either  allow
    or dismiss the appeal, with a Kurdish Sorani interpreter.

19. The Claimant shall no later than 4 PM on 24 February 2020 file with the
    Upper Tribunal and served upon the Secretary of State's  representative
    a consolidated,  indexed,  and  paginated  bundle  containing  all  the
    documentary evidence upon which he intends to rely. Witness  statements
    in the bundle must be signed, dated, and contain a declaration of truth
    and shall stand as the evidence in chief of the maker who shall be made
    available for the  purposes  of  cross-examination  and  re-examination
    only.

20. The Secretary of State shall have leave, if so  advised,  to  file  any
    further documentation she intends to rely upon and in response  to  the
    Claimant's evidence; provided the same is filed no later than 4 PM on 2
    March 2020.
