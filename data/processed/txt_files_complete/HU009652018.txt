Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Uddin, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with the permission of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  E  M  M  Smith
    dismissing his appeal against a decision of  the  respondent,  dated  4
    December 2017, to refuse his application for leave to remain  on  human
    rights grounds.

 2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh. He arrived in the UK in July
    2011, entering lawfully as a visitor. He was granted further  leave  on
    an exceptional basis until September 2012. The appellant sought further
    leave on the ground that removing him would  breach  his  rights  under
    article 8 of the Human  Rights  Convention  and  also  that  he  had  a
    derivative right of residence under the EEA  Regulations.  His  appeals
    came to an end when the appellant withdrew his appeal.  On  26  January
    2016 the appellant made the current application.

 3. The application was supported by a report from Ms Christine  Brown,  an
    independent social worker, who had met the appellant and his mother for
    two  hours  in  December  2013.  The  appellant's   mother,   Mrs   [Z]
    Choudhury[1] was born in 1948, married when she was seventeen  and  had
    seven children of whom the appellant is the eldest. She came to the  UK
    with her husband and six of her children in 1987.  The  appellant,  who
    was then 21, remained in Bangladesh and later married. Mrs  Choudhury's
    husband died in 2005. She became isolated as her  other  children  were
    busy with their respective families and her  health  deteriorated.  She
    suffered renal failure and was started on  dialysis.   She  had  become
    very dependent on the appellant. A report by a consultant psychiatrist,
    Dr Hajioff, found Mrs Choudhury was depressed and anxious in June 2014.
    He found she was in need of close  supervision.  Ms  Brown  recommended
    that the appellant be permitted to remain to continue as  his  mother's
    carer.  The report was dated 22 August 2014.

 4. The notice of decision, dated 4 December  2017,  set  out  reasons  for
    refusing the appellant's application. Firstly, his  application  failed
    the Suitability requirements of the Immigration Rules  because  he  had
    failed to pay NHS charges exceeding ï¿½500[2].  Secondly,  the  appellant
    did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) in  any  event
    because he had not shown there were very significant obstacles  to  his
    reintegration in Bangladesh. He was 44 years of age when he arrived  in
    the UK and his wife and children reside there. Thirdly, there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances warranting  a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    rules. The appellant had  been  granted  leave  exceptionally  until  6
    September 2012 in order to make permanent arrangements for his mother's
    care. He was advised at that time that further leave was unlikely to be
    granted. The appellant's mother was British  and,  whilst  it  was  not
    disputed she had significant care needs, she  could  be  cared  for  by
    means of other arrangements.

 5. The appellant's solicitors filed grounds of  appeal  which  made  clear
    that the  appellant  was  no  longer  pursuing  his  claim  to  have  a
    derivative right of residence. Nor was it argued  the  appellant  could
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM  or  paragraph  276ADE(1)  of  the
    rules. Instead, the grounds  argued  the  appellant  should  have  been
    granted leave outside the rules.

 6. The appeal was heard by the First-tier Tribunal in Birmingham on 6 June
    2018. The judge noted the age of the reports by Ms Brown and Dr Hajioff
    and the absence of  up  to  date  medical  evidence.  As  of  2014  the
    appellant's mother was suffering from heart  failure,  kidney  failure,
    high blood pressure and symptoms of depression.  The  judge  noted  the
    claim that the appellant's siblings are unable  or  unwilling  to  look
    after their mother and that, by default, it has fallen to the appellant
    to do so. The judge directed himself as to  the  correct  test  in  the
    circumstances that the rules are not met[3] and noted the appellant had
    only made one phone call to the local  council  to  enquire  about  the
    possibility of other care arrangements being made. The  extent  of  Mrs
    Choudhury's care needs had not been made clear and the evidence did not
    show she required a live-in  carer.  He  noted  the  appellant's  other
    children had not  given  evidence  to  bear  out  the  claim  that  Mrs
    Choudhury had been abandoned by them. The judge considered  the  impact
    of section 117B of the 2002 Act and the fact the appellant did not have
    leave. He  concluded  the  appellant's  removal  would  not  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  appellant's  mother  and  the
    decision was proportionate.

 7. Permission to appeal was sought on the basis the judge  had  overlooked
    significant  evidence  such  as  a  medical  letter  showing  that  the
    appellant's mother had reduced life expectancy and her last wish was to
    be with her son.

 8. Permission was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  because  it  was
    arguable the judge's assessment of the severity of the consequences  of
    the appellant's removal had been incomplete. He had  proceeded  on  the
    basis that there was no recent medical evidence before him  so  he  had
    overlooked the letter, dated 23 May 2018, from Mrs Choudhury's treating
    consultant.  The  grant  advised  that  any  error  found  might  prove
    immaterial in the light of the other findings made.

 9. The respondent filed a rule 24 response opposing the appeal.

10. The letter which the appellant now relies on is dated 23 May  2018  and
    is addressed to the Home Office. The author is  Dr  Andrew  Findlay,  a
    consultant nephrologist at Luton and Dunstable Hospital. It states that
    Mrs Chowdhury (sic) has been one of his  haemodialysis  patients  since
    2011. She requires dialysis three times a week.  She  also  has  severe
    cardiac failure. Realistically, her condition means she would require a
    significant care package that the state would have to  fund.  Her  son,
    the appellant, has been providing this since 2011 which has  inevitably
    prevented recurrent hospital admissions. Mrs Chowdhury has  "inevitable
    reduced life expectancy given her co-morbidities  and  really  her  son
    providing the caring role (not a small undertaking at all)  during  her
    final years is limiting the burden on the  NHS".  The  letter  requests
    that this information be taken into account.

11. I heard submissions from the representatives as to whether the decision
    of Judge Smith contains a material error of law. I shall set out only a
    brief summary.

12. Mr Uddin's submissions largely  amounted  to  the  re-argument  of  the
    merits of the appeal.  In effect, he  said  the  fact  the  appellant's
    mother was dying and her last wish was to be with  her  son  must  mean
    there were exceptional circumstances for article 8 purposes, justifying
    a positive decision outside the rules.  The  judge's  oversight  of  Dr
    Findlay's letter was a material error.

13. Mr Melvin relied on his rule 24 response. There could  be  no  material
    error because all the information  in  Dr  Findlay's  letter  had  been
    accepted by the judge.

14. I find there is no material error of law  in  Judge  Smith's  decision,
    which must stand. The  circumstances  of  this  case  inevitably  evoke
    compassion. However, my task is to decide dispassionately whether Judge
    Smith's decision was erroneous in law. The single  argument  raised  is
    that, in coming to his conclusion that the decision was  proportionate,
    he had overlooked the recent letter from Dr Findlay and,  as  such,  he
    had not fully recognised the severity of the consequences  of  removing
    the appellant.

15. I accept Dr Findlay's letter was before the judge and that he does  not
    refer to it expressly in his decision. I also accept that, in paragraph
    33, the judge stated that there was an absence of contemporary evidence
    to  establish,  among  other  things,  the  state  generally   of   Mrs
    Choudhury's health. At paragraph 25 he stated that there was no  up  to
    date medical report, although Dr Findlay's letter could not properly be
    described as a "report". In any event, it is relatively clear that  the
    judge did not take the  letter  into  account,  despite  the  fact  the
    appellant mentioned it in paragraph 11 of his witness statement.

16. However, even if this amounted to an error of law, it could not be said
    to have been material, by which I mean that it cannot  be  shown  that,
    had the judge taken the letter into account, his  decision  might  have
    been different. My reasons for reaching this conclusion are as follows.

17. The information contained in  Dr  Findlay's  letter  is  that  (1)  Mrs
    Choudhury receives dialysis and has heart  failure,  (2)  she  requires
    significant care which the appellant has provided since 2011 and  which
    the state would have to pay for in  his  absence,  and,  (3)  that  Mrs
    Choudhury has reduced life expectancy. In my  judgment,  all  of  these
    matters are adequately reflected in the findings of the judge.

18. At paragraph 25 the judge noted that Mrs Choudhury was  shown  to  have
    been suffering from high blood pressure,  episodes  of  heart  failure,
    kidney failure and symptoms of depression in 2014. He continued,  "[i]t
    is more probable than not that her health is no better now".  In  other
    words, he proceeded on the basis that Mrs Choudhury's condition was  as
    described by Dr Findlay.

19. In the same paragraph the judge stated that "there is common ground ...
    the appellant has in some form or another cared for his mother and  his
    mother requires some form of care". Dr Findlay's  letter  refers  to  a
    "significant care package" but does not say  what  exactly  that  would
    involve. Again, at paragraph 31 the judge noted that "[i]t is an agreed
    fact that the mother's health requires significant input by someone  to
    help her manage her day to day living", although the extent of that was
    not clear. The judge was doubtful regarding the appellant's claim  that
    he had to be with his mother "throughout" and that  he  was  a  live-in
    carer. It was open to the judge to reject  the  claim  for  the  reason
    given, namely that the appellant had only made one phone  call  to  the
    council about alternative care arrangements notwithstanding the warning
    issued by  the  Home  Office  when  granting  him  a  short  period  of
    discretionary leave in 2012. Dr Findlay's letter shed no further  light
    on either the extent of the care role assumed by the appellant  or  the
    enquiries made with social services.

20. It is implicit from the judge's concern that no realistic  efforts  had
    been made to make alternative arrangements that he recognised that  the
    source of care in the absence of the appellant was  likely  to  be  the
    council and therefore that the burden would  be  borne  by  the  public
    purse. In any event, it would not sit well with this appellant to  have
    argued that he was saving the state from having to  fund  his  mother's
    care in the circumstances that he had not paid his own substantial bill
    from the NHS[4].

21. I do not consider that the final point made  by  Dr  Findlay  that  Mrs
    Choudhury has reduced life expectancy requires further elaboration.  As
    said, the judge was fully aware of the serious medical conditions which
    she suffered from. It is common knowledge, if not,  common  sense  that
    kidney failure coupled with heart failure will reduce life expectancy.

22. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  appellant's
    appeal is adequately reasoned and took full  account  of  the  relevant
    evidence. The judge reached a conclusion which it was open  to  him  to
    reach on the facts. His decision must stand.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal is dismissed. The Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
did not make a material error of law and his decision dismissing the  appeal
shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
