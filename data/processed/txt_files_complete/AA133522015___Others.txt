Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms N Bustani
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants' appeals against decisions to  refuse  their  protection
    and human rights claims were dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Baldwin ("the judge") in a decision promulgated on  2nd  October  2017.
    They first came before the First-tier Tribunal in June  2016  and  were
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules ("the rules") and on  asylum  and
    human rights grounds.  Following an onward appeal, the  Upper  Tribunal
    remitted them to the First-tier  Tribunal,  limited  to  requiring  the
    human rights grounds of appeal to be reheard and decided.  The  adverse
    findings regarding asylum and humanitarian protection made in the First-
    tier Tribunal in 2016 were preserved.

2.   The judge found that the Article 8  case  advanced  by  the  appellants
    contained discrete elements, including the first appellant's mental ill
    health, the extent of the medical and support services available to her
    and the best interests of the third and fourth appellants, the children
    of the family.  Overall, the judge concluded that the appellants  could
    not succeed and that removal of all the family members  together  would
    not be disproportionate or otherwise unlawful.

3.   In an application for permission to appeal, two grounds were  advanced.
     The first concerned the position of the children, and particularly the
    older, born on 30th March 2011.  As at the date of the  hearing  before
    the judge, on 19th September 2017, she was 6ï¿½ years old.   Nonetheless,
    paragraphs in the grounds expressly assert that  the  children  of  the
    family have been in the United Kingdom for over seven years  (paragraph
    10) and  that  the  fact  of  seven  years'  residence  must  be  given
    significant weight (paragraph 14) and forms the basis for leave  to  be
    granted unless there are powerful reasons to  the  contrary  (paragraph
    15).   It  is  also  asserted  in  this  context  that  there  are   no
    countervailing reasons why  the  appeals  should  not  be  allowed,  as
    "section 117B(6) is met".

4.   It was contended in the second ground that the judge erred  in  failing
    to deal with the cases as conjoined appeals, in the light  of  guidance
    given by the Upper Tribunal in PD and Others [2016] UKUT 00108.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted on 27th November 2017.  In a  rule  24
    response prepared on behalf of the Secretary of State, the  appeal  was
    opposed on the basis that the judge had made a thorough assessment  and
    properly considered the best interests of the children and the position
    of all the family members.

Submissions on Error of Law

6.   In the light of the date of birth  of  the  older  child,  I  asked  Ms
    Bustani how the first ground  could  succeed  on  the  basis  that  the
    children of the family have been  present  here  for  more  than  seven
    years.  She accepted that the ground fell away and the case  could  not
    be advanced as a case in which such a  period  of  residence  could  be
    shown.

7.   However,  there  was  no  overall  assessment  of  the  family  in  the
    decision.  The first appellant came here in August 2008.   Very  little
    was known about the circumstances of her husband, the second appellant.
     He was, nonetheless, part of the family.  The  two  children  had  not
    been present here for seven  years  but  their  circumstances  required
    careful consideration.  The judge found that the first appellant, their
    mother, had been traumatised.

8.   The best interests assessment appeared at paragraph 36 of the  decision
    but it was not particularly  thorough.   At  paragraph  37,  the  judge
    appeared to revert to the first appellant's circumstances and  overall,
    the decision seemed to focus on her  position  and  not  those  of  the
    entire family or the other members.

9.   Mr Tufan said that  the  case  was  similar  in  some  respects  to  EV
    (Philippines), where the children of the family were  also  present  in
    the United Kingdom for less than seven  years.   The  Court  of  Appeal
    concluded that a "real world" assessment had to  be  made.   There  was
    nothing before the First-tier Tribunal to  suggest  that  other  family
    members could succeed.  The judge considered the medical  report.   The
    best interests of the children appeared to be the strongest feature  of
    the case.  The judge considered their circumstances  at  paragraphs  36
    and 37 and it was clear that he made a careful analysis.  He looked  at
    the position outside the rules, noting that the parents  were  educated
    and that close family members were present in Sri Lanka.  Delay on  the
    respondent's part had not caused any prejudice.  The judge  also  found
    that the first and second appellants would remain together  with  their
    children, on removal, thus furthering the children's best interests.

10.  Ms Bustani made a brief reply.  The  facts  in  EV  (Philippines)  were
    very  different.   What  was  missing  in  the  present  decision   was
    consideration of  each  family  member's  circumstances.   It  was  not
    necessary for the children to  reach  the  threshold  of  seven  years.
    Their position  required  careful  consideration  in  any  event.   The
    decision lacked the detail showing  that  the  family's  circumstances,
    including the  second  appellant's  circumstances,  had  been  properly
    considered.

Conclusion on Error of Law

11.  Ms Bustani sensibly recognised that the  bulk  of  the  grounds,  where
    emphasis was placed on the presence  of  the  children  in  the  United
    Kingdom for over seven years, rather fell  away.   The  decision  shows
    that the judge had the ages of the  children  and  their  circumstances
    clearly in mind.

12.  The judge granting permission noted that some of the paragraphs in  the
    decision are rather long.  There is some force in this  but  a  careful
    reading shows that the judge made a painstaking assessment in the light
    of the evidence before him.  He carefully considered the  circumstances
    of the entire family and, I find, gave due  weight  to  the  particular
    circumstances relating to each individual member.

13.  As Ms Bustani said, much of the decision concerns the  first  appellant
    but this is hardly surprising in view of  the  extent  of  the  medical
    evidence relating to her.  The judge found that she had suffered trauma
    in the past and remained very troubled.

14.  So far as the children are concerned,  the  judge  expressly  addressed
    their best interests in paragraph 36 of the decision  but  clearly  had
    their circumstances in mind throughout the analysis.  For  example,  at
    paragraph 33 he  referred  to  documentary  evidence  from  the  school
    regarding the older child's attendance and her progress.

15.  At paragraph 35, the judge noted that the children will  form  part  of
    the family unit on removal, together with  the  second  appellant,  the
    first appellant's husband.  He described the second appellant  as  well
    educated and as having worked  previously  in  Sri  Lanka.   The  adult
    appellants have their parents and a number of siblings in Sri Lanka.

16.  Although the judge reverted to the first appellant's  circumstances  at
    the beginning of paragraph 37, towards the end of  that  paragraph  the
    position of the children is again brought into the picture.  The  judge
    focussed on the ties established by  the  older  child,  in  pre-school
    education and within the  family  unit.   He  expressly  mentioned  her
    sibling in this part of the decision.  In that same paragraph what  the
    second appellant knows  about  the  medicines  and  support  the  first
    appellant needs was also taken into account.  Mention was made again of
    the presence in Sri Lanka of several close adult relatives.

17.  Overall, contrary to  what  is  asserted  in  the  grounds,  the  judge
    clearly has considered the position of the  individual  appellants  and
    has also assessed the circumstances of the  entire  family.   In  other
    words, he has treated the appeals as conjoined and his approach to  the
    evidence and his analysis is fully consistent with  guidance  given  by
    the Upper Tribunal in PD and Others.

18.  Read overall,  the  decision  shows  a  thorough  engagement  with  the
    evidence and a careful assessment.  The  judge  has  given  cogent  and
    sustainable  reasons  for  concluding  that  the  appeals  fell  to  be
    dismissed.  The grounds in support of the application for permission to
    appeal have not been made out.  The decision contains no material error
    of law and shall stand.
