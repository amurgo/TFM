For the Appellant:     Mr McVitie, a Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Gary McIndo an Assistant Solicitor with Latitude
Law


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   In this appeal the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  is  the
    appellant.  To avoid confusion I shall refer to the Secretary of  State
    as "the Secretary of State" and to Ravi Kanth Bedadi as  the  appellant
    "the appellant".
2.   The appellant was born on 8th July, 1982 and is  a  citizen  of  India.
    He made application to the Secretary of State for leave to remain as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system and  for  a
    biometric  residence  permit.   His  application  was   refused   under
    paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules on  20th  May,  2013  and  the
    appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Malik heard the appeal in Manchester on  7th  October,  2013  and
    instead of either allowing or refusing the appeal, concluded  that  the
    Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department's  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

3.    It  was  conceded  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  that  the
    documents submitted by and on behalf of the appellant did not meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, but it  was  asserted  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance with the  law,
    because no reasons have  been  given  why  her  evidential  flexibility
    powers  have  not  been  used,  given  that  paragraph  245AA  of   the
    Immigration Rules can take into account new evidence.

4.   The judge also found that because the notice of decision contained  two
    decisions, namely a decision to refuse leave and a decision  to  remove
    the appellant under Section 47 of the 2006 Act, the decision to  remove
    the appellant could not stand.

5.   The Secretary of State challenged the decision on the basis first of  a
    misapplication  of  paragraph  245AA  and  evidential  flexibility  and
    secondly on a misapplication of the law, given at  Section  51  of  the
    Crime and Courts Act 2013 (affective from  8th  May,  2013)  gives  the
    Secretary of State power to issue removal directions under  Section  47
    in the same decision as the Notice of Refusal.

6.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Pullig granted permission to appeal.

7.   In a helpful response under Rule 24 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules, 2008, it was accepted on behalf of the appellant  that
    the Secretary of State's decision made on 20th May,  2013,  to  make  a
    simultaneous refusal of leave and removal decision, was  permitted.  In
    respect of a substantive challenge made by the Secretary of State,  the
    appellant's response asserted that the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State was not in accordance with the law.

8.   Mr McVitie told me that he relied on the Secretary of State's  grounds.
     For the respondent, Mr McIndo accepted that  the  documents  submitted
    with the application did not comply with the  Rules.   But  the  errors
    were in the format of the third party letter and ordinarily should have
    led to  a  request  from  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  to  the
    respondent for further evidence under Rule 245AA.  It was alleged  that
    letters from the State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of India  and  the
    Department of Posts - India do not contain the full  address  including
    the postcode and landline telephone number of Mr Bedadi Ram Mohan.  The
    letter from the Secretary of State also complains that the letter  from
    the State Bank of Hyderabad does not state the appellant's full name or
    the name of the funds being made available to him  and,  therefore,  do
    not meet the criteria specified at paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of Appendix  A
    of the Immigration Rules.

9.   Additionally the third party declaration letter has not been signed  by
    the appellants and the letter from the advocate  does  not  contain  Mr
    Bedadi Ram Mohan's ID document details and does not therefore meet  the
    criteria  specified  in  paragraph  41-SD(b)  of  Appendix  A  of   the
    Immigration Rules.  Furthermore  evidence  supplied  by  the  appellant
    failed to meet the requirements of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules,
    because it confirms that he  only  has  access  to  the  equivalent  of
    �28,194.80 which is below the �50,000 requirement.   The  Secretary  of
    State's letter of 20th May, 2013 went on to say

         "The decision has been made not to request additional documentation
         or exceptionally consider the application under  the  provision  of
         paragraph 245AA as  it  is  not  anticipated  that  addressing  the
         omission or error would lead to a grant of leave".

10.  The Presenting Officer suggested that the format of  the  documentation
    was perfectly  acceptable,  but  what  is  unacceptable  was  that  the
    contents failed to meet the Rules.  Rule 245AA, as it was at  the  date
    of the decision, makes it clear that documents will  not  be  requested
    where a specific  document  has  been  submitted  or  where  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or Secretary of State  does  not
    anticipate that addressing the initial error referred to will lead to a
    grant, because the application will be refused for another reason.   He
    suggested that the contents of the documents were wrong in the  context
    of the Immigration Rules format means, for example, if a letter is  not
    on letter headed paper as specified.

11.  Responding briefly Mr McIndo suggested that all information apart  from
    the  address  and  telephone  number  was  submitted.   I  reserved  my
    decision.

12.   It  was  accepted  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  that  the
    documents submitted on  behalf  of  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.   The  question  before  me  is,
    therefore, whether the Secretary of State has erred in law  by  failing
    to apply the provisions of paragraph 245AA.

13.  The Secretary  of  State's  decision  was  taken  on  20th  May,  2013.
    Between 13th  December,  2013  and  30th  June,  2013  there  were  six
    different versions of the Immigration Rules.  According to the  version
    which was applicable at the time which had been published on  1st  May,
    2013 paragraph 245AA was as follows:-

         "245AA.  Documents not submitted with applications


         (a)  Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
             that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance
             Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary  of  State  will
             only consider documents that  have  been  submitted  with  the
             application, and will only consider documents submitted  after
             the application where they are submitted  in  accordance  with
             sub-paragraph (b).


         (b)  If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:-
             (i)  some of the documents in sequence have been  omitted  (if
                  for example, one bank statement from a series is missing);


             (ii) a document is in the wrong  format  (for  example,  if  a
                  letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or


             (iii)    a document is a copy and not an original document; or




             (iv)  a  document  does  not   contain   all   the   specified
                  information;

         The Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or  the  Secretary
         of State may contact the applicant or his representative in writing
         and request the correct documents.  The requested documents must be
         received at the address  specified  in  the  request  within  seven
         working days of the date of the request.

         (c)  documents will not be requested where a specified document has
             not  been  submitted  (for   example   an   English   language
             certificate is missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer,
             Immigration Officer or Secretary of State does not  anticipate
             that addressing the omission or  error  referred  to  in  sub-
             paragraph (b) will lead to a  grant  because  the  application
             will be refused for other reasons.

         (d)  if the applicant has submitted a specified document:-

             (i)  in the wrong format or


             (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or


             (iii)     which  does  not  contain  all  of   the   specified
                  information but  the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                  from:-

                  (1)  other documents submitted with the application


                  (2)  the website of  the  organisation  which  issued  the
                      document or


                  (3)  the website from the appropriate regulatory body.

         The application may be granted exceptionally, providing  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State is
         satisfied  that  the  specified  documents  are  genuine  and   the
         applicant meets all the other requirements.   The  Entry  Clearance
         Officer, Immigration Officer or Secretary  of  State  reserves  the
         right to request the specified original documents  in  the  correct
         format in all cases where (b) applies and, to  refuse  applications
         if these documents are not provided as set out in (b)."

14.  It is alleged that the letters from the State Bank  of  Hyderabad,  the
    State Bank of India and the Department of Posts - India  are  defective
    because they  do  not  contain  Mr  Bedadi  Ram  Mohan's  full  address
    including postcode and landline number.  The letter from the State Bank
    of Hyderabad does not state the appellant's name  or  amount  of  funds
    being available to him.

15.  It seems to me that these are  documents  which  fall  under  paragraph
    245AA(b)(iv)  because  they  do  not  contain  all  of  the   specified
    information.  The Secretary of State  also  complains  that  the  third
    party declaration letter has not been signed by the appellant  and  the
    letter from the attorney does not contain all Mr Bedadi Ram Mohan's  ID
    document  details.   Insofar  as  the  letter  from  the  attorney   is
    concerned, this is again something which does not contain  all  of  the
    specified information and falls within paragraph 245AA(b)(iv).   As  to
    the signing of the third party declaration letter, it seemed to me that
    this was an obvious error which could quite easily have been  corrected
    by the appellant being asked to sign it.  I have concluded,  therefore,
    that the decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance  with
    the law and Immigration Rules. Had she applied the version of paragraph
    245AA which was in force at  the  date  of  her  decision  the  defects
    complained of could have been rectified.  I do  not  know  why  it  was
    specifically  decided  not  to  request  additional  documentation   or
    consider the application under the provisions of paragraph 245AA or why
    it was not anticipated that addressing the omission or error would lead
    to a grant of leave.  Unfortunately Mr McVitie was unable to assist me.

16.  I have concluded that the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    wrong.

17.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  said  in   paragraph   13   of   his
    determination that the decision appealed against was not in  accordance
    with the law.  He does not specifically say that he allowed the  appeal
    by the appellant.

18.  I am satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  did
    contain an error of law.  The  judge  had  failed  to  appreciate  that
    Section 51 of the Crime and Courts Act 2003 gave the Secretary of State
    for the Home Department the power to  issue  removal  directions  under
    Section 47 at the same time and in the same decision  as  a  Notice  of
    Refusal.  To that extent and to that extent only I allow the appeal  of
    the Secretary of State.

19.  The Secretary of State's refusal was, for  the  reasons  I  have  given
    above, not in accordance with the law.

Summary

20.  (1) The decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to vary leave  and
        to remove the appellant under Section 47 of the  2006  Act  was  in
        accordance with the law.

     (2) The  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  not  to  contact  the
        appellant or his representative in writing  and  request  corrected
        documents once it became apparent that documents submitted did  not
        contain all the specified information was not  in  accordance  with
        the law and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is upheld
        to that extent.
