 For the Respondent:   Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                         DECISION AND REASONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Mill
     (hereinafter referred to as the judge),  promulgated  on  25  February
     2016. Permission to appeal was granted on 21 March 2016 by  First-tier
     Tribunal Judge Shimmin.


                          � CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016




     Background


  2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom during  September  2009  with
     leave to enter as a Tier 4 migrant. His application for further  leave
     in the same capacity was refused and his appeal against that  decision
     dismissed. His appeal rights were exhausted as of June 2011. In August
     2012 the appellant was encountered by immigration officers, identified
     as an overstayer and detained. He then claimed asylum and was, in  due
     course, granted temporary admission. The appellant  failed  to  attend
     five asylum interviews scheduled between 2013 and 2015. His  interview
     ultimately took place during July 2015.

  3. The basis of the appellant's asylum claim is that, during 2009, he was
     twice badly beaten by an individual, MM and his family, owing  to  the
     appellant's refusal to marry MM's sister. MM was said to  be  a  local
     leader  of  the  Awami  League,  whereas  the  appellant  had  a  past
     affiliation with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). In  addition,
     MM had filed a false murder allegation naming the appellant, following
     which a warrant had been issued for his arrest. The appellant's family
     disowned him because of his failure to marry MM's sister. He then left
     Bangladesh in possession of the above-mentioned entry clearance to the
     United Kingdom.  The  appellant  also  provided  documentary  evidence
     indicating that he had been suffering from mental illness  during  his
     time in the United Kingdom.

  4. The Secretary of State refused the appellant's claim principally owing
     to what were  considered  to  be  a  number  of  implausible  aspects,
     inconsistencies and his immigration history. The  appellant's  claimed
     suicide attempt was considered, however the respondent did not  accept
     that the appellant met the tests in J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629 and Y
     (Sri Lanka) [2009] EWCA Civ 362.

  5. On 17 February 2016, the date of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
     Tribunal, those representing appellant provided his  evidence  to  the
     respondent and Tribunal. An unsuccessful attempt was made to renew  an
     adjournment application, in order to obtain an expert report as to the
     authenticity of the documents  he  had  provided  at  his  his  asylum
     interview on 21 July 2015. The judge rejected the appellant's account,
     finding him to be a poor witness and his claim to be manufactured. The
     appellant's delay in applying for asylum and attending  a  substantive
     interview was also found to adversely affect the  credibility  of  his
     claim. The judge found that there was no evidence  to  show  that  the
     appellant's mental state, described in reports  as  anxiety  and  mild
     depression, could not be treated in Bangladesh.


      Error of law


    6.  Permission  to  appeal  was  sought  on  the  basis  of   procedural
       unfairness; in that, firstly, the judge erred in failing  to  adjourn
       the appeal and secondly, that the appellant  was  not  treated  as  a
       vulnerable witness in a number of  respects.  A  statement  from  the
       solicitor (Ms Duszynska)  who  had  appeared  before  the  judge  was
       appended to the grounds and contained a catalogue of complaints about
       the judge's conduct during the appellant's hearing.




    7. The judge granting permission did so solely on the basis that it  was
       arguable that the refusal of an adjournment in relation to  the  late
       service of the respondent's bundle  revealed  procedural  unfairness.
       The second ground, ostensibly in relation to an asserted  refusal  to
       hold the appeal in camera was found by Judge Shimmin  to  be  without
       merit and not to reveal an error of law.

    8. The Secretary of State's response of 8 April  2016  stated  that  the
       respondent opposed the appeal as it was  considered  that  the  judge
       appropriately  directed  himself.  An  extract  from   a   presenting
       officer's note of the hearing was set out which was relevant  to  the
       judge's refusal to adjourn. It was said that the refusal  to  adjourn
       was entirely proportionate.


 The hearing


  9. Mr Cheng  relied  on  his  skeleton  argument,  which  focused  on  an
     assertion that the adjournment was sought in order  to  obtain  up  to
     date evidence of the appellant's  mental  state.  He  alluded  to  the
     litany of comments  about  the  judge  in  Ms  Duszynska's  statement,
     however he moved his arguments on after accepting that permission  had
     only been granted on the adjournment issue. Mr Cheng made much of  the
     fact that the respondent's  bundle  had  been  erroneously  served  on
     Hammersmith  &   Fulham   Law   Centre,   the   appellant's   previous
     representative. He was unable to point to any evidence  to  show  that
     Duncan Lewis Solicitors had informed the Secretary of State that  they
     were instructed in place of the Law Centre. Mr  Cheng  submitted  that
     the  documents  provided  by  the  appellant,  which   were   in   the
     respondent's bundle, would have taken Ms Duszynska by surprise at  the
     hearing. He was unable to  explain  why  this  was  so  when  she  was
     previously acting for the appellant while he was a client of the  said
     Law Centre. He contended that 2 and a half hours would not  have  been
     sufficient for Ms Duszynska to take instructions on  the  hearing  day
     but conceded that there was no further application  to  adjourn  as  a
     result of the said insufficient time.

 10. Mr Cheng argued that Duncan Lewis were unable to  instruct  an  expert
     prior to February 2016 because of the appellant's mental state. He did
     not develop this argument. He maintained that  Duncan  Lewis  did  not
     have a copy of the screening interview,  a  medical  report,  lawyer's
     letters and  political  letters  in  the  respondent's  bundle.  While
     explaining that he was not intending  to  "defend  the  conduct  of  a
     solicitor" Mr Cheng was unable to state why he was unable to point  to
     any efforts made by Duncan  Lewis  to  obtain  the  documents  in  the
     respondent's bundle, which were referred to, and indeed criticised, in
     the reasons for refusal letter.

 11. Mr Bramble relied on the note of Mrs N Afzali, the presenting  officer
     at the  appellant's  hearing.  He  argued  that  the  purpose  of  the
     adjournment application was solely to obtain a report from Dr Hoque as
     to the authenticity of the appellant's  documents.  While  Mr  Bramble
     accepted that the respondent's bundle  had  been  sent  to  the  wrong
     representative, he argued that Duncan Lewis Solicitors already had all
     the information provided  by  the  appellant  including  his  detailed
     witness statement of July 2015, letters  from  political  parties  and
     newspaper articles which were contained in their own bundle which  was
     submitted on the day of the hearing.  He  further  argued  that  other
     documents relied upon by the appellant, such as an affidavit from  his
     parents and the lawyer's letter did not require an expert  opinion  as
     to authenticity.



 12. Mr Cheng was unable to add anything of substance in response.

 13. At the end of the hearing, I announced that the judge made no material
     error of law. My reasons are as follows.

 14. I have had regard to  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)
     (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 regarding  the  power  the
     First-tier Tribunal has to adjourn or postpone  a  hearing  under  its
     case management powers. Regard should have been had to the  overriding
     objective set out in Rule 2 requiring the Tribunal to deal with  cases
     fairly and justly.

 15. I have also had  regard  to  the  decision  in  Nwaigwe  (Adjournment:
     Fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC). The crucial question being  whether
     the refusal of an adjournment deprived the affected party of  a  right
     to  a  fair  hearing.  I  have  also  taken  into  consideration   the
     Presidential Guidance Note  no.  1  of  2014  and  note  that  factors
     weighing in favour of adjourning an appeal,  even  at  a  late  stage,
     include whether further time is needed because of a delay in obtaining
     evidence which is outside the party's control, for example,  where  an
     expert witness fails to provide a report within the  period  expected.
     That is to be balanced by factors weighing against  the  grant  of  an
     adjournment, namely that the application was not made at the  earliest
     opportunity or is speculative or that it does not show  that  anything
     material would be achieved by the delay. In this  case,  there  is  no
     evidence of any real effort being made to obtain an expert  report  at
     all over a period of some years or  even  in  the  months  before  the
     hearing when Duncan Lewis were acting for the appellant and  therefore
     the lack of a report  was  not  owing  to  circumstances  outside  the
     control of the appellant's representatives.

 16. In SH (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 1284 at [13], it  was  held
     that when considering whether an adjournment should have been granted,
     the test was not irrationality or whether the  decision  was  properly
     open to the judge; the sole test was whether it was unfair. As  stated
     in Nwaigwe, supra, in practice, in most cases  the  question  will  be
     whether the refusal deprived the affected party of his right to a fair
     hearing. The appellant in this case has not been so deprived.

 17. The skeleton argument provided on the morning of the hearing before me
     argues, at [17] that the judge, "by refusing an  adjournment  for  the
     Appellant to obtain further medical reports, it is submitted  that  it
     prevented the Appellant from being able to provide the Tribunal with a
     full picture of his mental health condition." The judge records at [6]
     of the decision and  reasons  that  the  purpose  of  the  adjournment
     application is for an expert, Dr Hoque to provide a report focusing on
     the authenticity of the appellant's documents. It is apparent from the
     two earlier adjournment applications made in advance  of  the  hearing
     that  this  was  a  renewed  application.  While  I  note  the   first
     adjournment application  of  4  February  2016  made  a  reference  to
     obtaining up to date medical evidence, that was not stated to  be  the
     purpose of the second  written  adjournment  application  made  on  12
     February 2016. The presenting officer's note states as  follows;  "Rep
     requested an adjournment that  has  previously  been  refused  on  the
     papers. Rep wants to get an authenticity report." Even the grounds  of
     application make no reference to an adjournment  being  sought  for  a
     medical report.  I  therefore  reject  the  content  of  the  skeleton
     argument relied upon by Mr Cheng in this regard.





 18. Ground one of the application contends that there  were  documents  in
     the respondent's bundle the appellant had either not seen or  was  not
     in possession of and he had not, therefore,  had  the  opportunity  to
     give instructions on them. I find it hard to accept that the appellant
     would not be familiar with any of the  material  in  the  respondent's
     bundle; principally material which he had provided; or that  a  period
     in excess of two hours would not be  sufficient  to  discuss  them  in
     English, in which he  is  fluent,  notwithstanding  his  diagnosis  of
     anxiety and mild depression.

 19. There were six appendices to the respondent's bundle consisting of the
     screening and substantive interviews, a lengthy witness statement from
     the  appellant,  documents  submitted  by   the   appellant,   further
     submissions from Hammersmith and Fulham Law Centre  and  the  decision
     itself.  The  appellant  provided  his  documentary  evidence  at  the
     substantive interview, following which he gave instructions to the Law
     Centre. His documentary evidence is referred to repeatedly  throughout
     the Law Centre's subsequent representations as well as his own witness
     statement. It is not plausible  that  the  Law  Centre  did  not  also
     discuss the interviews with the appellant. The fact is that there  was
     no material in the respondent's bundle  of  which  the  appellant  was
     unaware. My view is fortified by the presenting officer's note,  which
     described what occurred after the adjournment application was refused;
     "Rep then said she did not have R's bundle.  The  documents  had  been
     largely produced within the Appellant's bundle - there was nothing new
     but IJ gave a copy of R's bundle to rep and she had 2 and �  hours  to
     consider it. Rep confirmed she was ready to proceed."

 20. The difficulty with the argument in ground one is that no  application
     for an adjournment was made on the basis that there  was  insufficient
     time to take instructions on the material in the respondent's  bundle.
     Accordingly, the judge cannot be criticised for  proceeding  with  the
     hearing in these circumstances, particularly when Ms Duszynska  stated
     that she was ready to proceed.

 21. The  judge  did  not  fall  into  procedural  error  in  refusing  the
     application to adjourn for the expert report. The presenting officer's
     note records that Ms Duszynska "has been acting for  Appellant  before
     lodging the GOA."  Indeed Mr Cheng confirmed that she  was  previously
     working at the Law Centre in question. The Law Centre was  acting  for
     the appellant at the time of his substantive asylum interview in  July
     2015 when  the  appellant  provided  his  documentary  evidence.  That
     evidence was subject to strong criticism in the refusal letter.  While
     Duncan Lewis took over the matter from October 2015,  at  the  latest,
     there was no evidence before me to show that any steps were  taken  to
     obtain an expert report at that stage or  even  after  the  notice  of
     hearing dated 3 December 2015 was served. As the judge rightly records
     at [6], the appellant's asylum claim was made in 2012, based on events
     from 2009. Mr Cheng was unable to explain how the  appellant's  mental
     state prevented Duncan  Lewis  Solicitors  from  obtaining  an  expert
     report once they were instructed. There was  no  documentary  evidence
     before the judge in the form of a letter of instruction to the expert.
     Nor was Mr Cheng able  to  respond  to  Mr  Bramble's  submissions  in
     relation to  the  utility  of  such  a  report  given  the  particular
     documents provided by the appellant. That the appeal was not adjourned
     for an expert report did not render the proceedings unfair.






 22. A significant reason for the judge  concluding  that  the  appellant's
     account was untrue was what was said at [21] of the decision which  is
     reproduced below;

      "At his screening interview in September 2012  the  Appellant  founded
his asylum  claim on the     basis that it was his  cousin's  daughter  that
his family had requested he  marry. He did not     name (MM) or the  alleged
political influence he has nor  crucially      did  he  claim  that  he  had
been accused of a murder he did not commit....He now names MM as the  father
of the      woman it was suggested he marry but that MM is not  his  cousin.
This is significantly  materially inconsistent.'

 23. At [22] of the decision, the judge notes  that  the  appellant  denied
     ever having been subject to an arrest warrant or being wanted  by  any
     law enforcement agency during his screening interview, while that  was
     the "most significant part of the asylum claim presented at his asylum
     interview." At [23] the judge considers  the  appellant's  account  of
     being able to leave Bangladesh  for  the  United  Kingdom  openly  and
     lawfully  while  there  is  a  warrant  of  arrest  for   his   murder
     outstanding,  to  be  unlikely.  At  [24]   the   judge   notes   that
     notwithstanding his  claim  to  be  falsely  accused  of  murder,  the
     appellant continued his studies in the United Kingdom "unperturbed" by
     the claimed events for a considerable length of time between 2009  and
     2012. He also comments, adversely, on the appellant's failure to claim
     asylum even when apprehended by an immigration officer and  the  claim
     being made subsequent to his immigration detention. Also noted is  the
     lack of medical evidence to support the appellant's claim to have been
     too unwell to attend five asylum interviews arranged over a period  of
     in excess of two years.

 24. In view of the varied and powerful grounds provided by the  judge  for
     rejecting the appellant's claim, there is no basis  for  finding  that
     even  a  favourable  expert's  report  on  the  authenticity  of   the
     appellant's documents would have made a  material  difference  to  the
     outcome of this appeal.

 25. The second ground of application was described by the  judge  granting
     permission to be "without merit" and to reveal no error of law. It  is
     notable that no complaint was made about  the  judge's  conduct  other
     than  in  Ms  Duszynska's  statement  attached  to  the  grounds   and
     accordingly, the judge has been unable to respond  to  the  criticisms
     contained therein, Azia (proof of misconduct  by  judge)  [2012]  UKUT
     00096(IAC) applies.

 26. No anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ, albeit it was at the case
     management hearing stage. It is appropriate that this be continued and
     therefore the following anonymity direction is made:

        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "







Conclusions


     The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
     the making of an error on a point of law.

     I uphold the decision of the FTTJ.
