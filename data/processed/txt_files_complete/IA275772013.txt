Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss A Radford, Counsel, instructed by HRS
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appealed against the respondent's  decision  on  14  June
    2013 to refuse her application for a derivative right of  residence  on
    Zambrano principles.  The refusal letter stated that:

         "As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in  the  United
         Kingdom you should now make arrangements to leave ...  Please  note
         that your entitlement to remain in the UK has solely been  assessed
         on  the  basis  of  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2006.  If you consider that you are entitled to  remain
         in the UK on the basis of other immigration legislation then please
         ...  submit   an   appropriate   application   for   consideration.
         Alternatively, if you consider that you have a right to  reside  in
         the United Kingdom as a  matter  of  European  law  and  are  in  a
         position to  submit  the  necessary  information  to  support  your
         application for a derivative residence card as recognition of  that
         right,  you  may  wish  to  submit  a   further   application   for
         consideration."

 2. The only dependant named on the application which the applicant made on
    10 February 2012 was her son, born 9 November 2010.  He is now 3� years
    old. However, between the application and the making of  the  Secretary
    of State's decision the applicant became pregnant  again  by  the  same
    father and in fact gave  birth  to  a  daughter  four  days  after  the
    Secretary of State's decision had been  made.   Rather  than  making  a
    further application as suggested in the refusal letter,  the  applicant
    appealed and under the heading of  "Statement  of  Additional  Grounds"
    stated "I request consideration of Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Act
    1998".

 3. On 30 January 2014 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Rastogi  determined  the
    appeal.  The following findings of fact were made: that  the  applicant
    came to the UK on 27 July 2001 and had been here without leave since 13
    June 2005; that she had been living with the children's father and that
    he was a man not lacking in commitment to any of his children and  that
    due to the paucity of evidence produced by the appellant the judge  was
    not satisfied that the children's father had  taken  no  responsibility
    for his son.  There is no finding about his baby daughter.

 4. At paragraph 36 of the determination the judge found that it  was  more
    likely than not that the appellant was her son's prime carer  but  that
    she had not produced evidence which satisfied the judge that the little
    boy would be de facto compelled to follow her to Jamaica.

 5. At paragraph 38 the determination deals with the baby.

         "38.  For the avoidance of any doubt, although the application only
             named the appellant's son as the  EU  citizen  upon  whom  her
             application was founded, the findings  I  make  apply  to  her
             daughter as well."

    There is no further reasoning in relation to the 6 months old baby girl
    and the rest of the determination refers only to 3�  year  old  boy  in
    consideration of the EEA Regulations.

 6. There was some dispute about whether  it  was  relevant  to  deal  with
    Article 8 but given that Article 8 is raised in the grounds  of  appeal
    the judge,  correctly  in  my  view,  also  addressed  Article  8.   At
    paragraph 61 of the determination she found that both of  the  children
    were British citizens and if they were forced to return to Jamaica  and
    grow up there they would lose the benefit of their British and European
    citizenship as well as severing their family  relationship  with  their
    father who is also a British citizen  and  might  not  accompany  their
    mother to Jamaica.  If the children were to  remain  in  the  UK  their
    family life with the applicant, who the judge was satisfied  was  their
    prime carer, would be severed.

 7. Paragraph 62 of the determination purports then to consider the  matter
    with reference to Appendix FM of the Rules but we  now  know  from  the
    decision in Edghill that that is an incorrect approach.   There  is  no
    separate consideration in the Article 8 reasoning in  relation  to  the
    impracticality of separating a 6 months old baby from its mother.  Both
    of these children are British citizens and are entitled to the  benefit
    of their British citizenship and their EEA citizenship while growing up
    and that, given the youth of the baby girl, means that they  must  have
    their mother with them wherever they are and in order to exercise their
    EEA rights and British citizenship rights that must be in the UK.

 8. The appellant's challenge on which permission was  granted  is  to  the
    derivative right to residence decision on reasons grounds  and  to  the
    judge's decision to refer only to Section 84(1)(c) of the 2002 Act  and
    not 84(1)(g) which on these facts is a distinction without a difference
    since both deal with Article 8  and  the  theoretical  removal  of  the
    appellant to Jamaica which the present decision would entail.

 9. I am  satisfied  that  there  is  a  material  error  of  law  in  this
    determination in particular the Edgehill error in paragraph 62 but also
    the failure separately to consider the Section 55 rights of the  second
    child who is still under the age of 1 year and in relation to  the  EEA
    Regulations and Article 8 also.  I  therefore  proceed  to  remake  the
    decision having regard to the very helpful  submissions  of  both  Miss
    Radford and Mr Saunders.

10. Beginning with the  EEA  Regulations  point  the  relevant  section  of
    Regulation 15A which is set out  in  paragraph  10  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal determination at 4A states that

         "(4A) P (parent) satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if -

              (a)      is the primary  carer  of  a  British  citizen  ('the
             relevant British citizen')

              (b)      the relevant  British  citizen  is  residing  in  the
             United Kingdom; and

             (c)  the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside in
                  the UK or in another EEA  State  if  P  were  required  to
                  leave"

11. The question whether the  appellant  is  the  primary  carer  of  these
    children was still in the First-tier Tribunal determination and on  the
    facts at least the second child would be unable to reside in the UK  or
    another EEA state if this appellant  were  required  to  leave  and  to
    return to Jamaica. Accordingly this appellant is entitled to derivative
    right of residence on EEA grounds.

12. On the facts there is no need for separate consideration of Section 55,
    the best interests of these children are to be with their prime  carer,
    in this case their mother.

13. Turning to Article 8, even if the appeal had not  succeeded  under  the
    EEA Regulations I  am  satisfied  in  the  light  of  the  findings  in
    particular at paragraph 61 of the determination that if the Razgar test
    had been properly applied with reference to how young  the  appellant's
    daughter is, that the judge would have concluded that she would have to
    return to Jamaica if her mother were to be removed from the  UK.   That
    would be a breach of the principles set  out  in  ZH  (Tanzania)  since
    British citizens are entitled to grow up  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    therefore both on ZH (Tanzania) and  Zambrano  principles  this  appeal
    succeeds.

14. I allow the appeal on all grounds.
