Representation:

For the Appellant: Mrs. M.Clechorn, Counsel, instructed by VMD Solicitors.
For the Respondent: Mr Diwacz, Home Office Presenting Officer.

CONSENT ORDER FURTHER TO RULE 39 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL)
RULES 2008.

   1. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka. She was granted leave to
      enter as a Tier 4 student from 22 January 2011 to 31 December 2014.
      She arrived in February 2011 accompanied by her husband and their two
      children, now aged 17 and 12, as her dependents.


   2. She enrolled at the London Institute of Management and Technology.
      There was a preliminary course on English from 22 February 2011 to 11
      August 2011.This led into a full-time degree course in business
      studies. This was to start in September 2011 and run until August
      2014.

   3. The appellant did not complete her studies as the college closed the
      facility in July/August 2014.

   4. The policy of the respondent is that where a student, through no fault
      of their own, cannot complete a course a 60-day notice is issued. This
      is to give them an opportunity to enrol in an alternative course. The
      principle behind this was set out in the decision of Alam -v- SSHD
      [2012] EWCA Civ 960.

   5. On 19 December 2014 the appellant applied for leave to remain outside
      the rules. This was refused on 16 March 2015. The refusal letter makes
      no reference to the 60-day policy. It notes that the appellant was
      asking that the respondent exercise discretion outside the rules .This
      was on the basis of compelling circumstances: namely, that she had not
      been able to complete her studies as the college's licence had been
      suspended and she had not been able to obtain a new CAS.

   6. The refusal did not find compelling circumstances existed. Appendix FM
      of the rules did not assist as her husband was not a British national
      nor was he settled. The eligibility criteria in respect of her
      children did not apply. With regard to paragraph 276 ADE, no
      significant obstacles to her return were identified. No basis for a
      freestanding article 8 assessment was identified.

   7. The appellant's appeal against that decision was heard by First-tier
      Immigration Judge Bircher on the 10th July 2015. The 60 day provision
      was referred to at paragraph 16 of the decision  :

         There is no indication in the papers before me to demonstrate that
         the first appellant was offered a period of 60 days within which
         she was required to find an alternative educational institution...


      The judge referred to case law on this issue. Paragraph 24 states:


         There is no documentation before me from either party to
         demonstrate that the first appellant was afforded a period of 60
         days to secure a student placement ...

   8. Having noted the issue the judge did not go on to deal  with it beyond
      the comment at paragraph 24 that it may be the case the 60 day period
      had already been offered to the appellant. The judge then dealt with
      the appeal in the context of appendix FM and EX 1 and paragraph 276
      ADE. The judge concluded that grounds did not exist for a freestanding
      article 8 assessment.


   9. The application for permission was on the basis that there was no
      finding as to whether the respondent's policy had been applied. A
      failure by the respondent to follow her policy meant the decision was
      wrong in law.

  10. At today's hearing Mrs. Clechorn referred to paragraphs 16 and 24. Mr
      Diwacz accepted that the respondent could not demonstrate a 60-day
      notice had been issued. Mrs. Clechorn argued that as the respondent
      could not demonstrate the policy had been applied the proper course
      should have been for the judge to refer the matter back to the
      respondent. The judge's failure to recognise this tainted the
      consideration of article 8. Mr Diwacz accepts the merit of Mrs.
      Clechorn's argument

Consent order

  11. Both parties are in agreement that there is a material error of law in
      Judge Bircher's decision and cannot stand. The matter should be
      referred back to the respondent for the issue of a 60-day notice. Any
      subsequent decision will carry attendant appeal rights.
