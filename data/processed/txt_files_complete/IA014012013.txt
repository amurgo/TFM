For the appellant:  Mahmud al-Rashid  (counsel instructed by David Grand)
For the respondent: Mr Tom Wilding

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Warren Grant), sitting at Taylor House on 1 May, to  an
    EEA appeal by a citizen of Nigeria, born 3 November 1973, and  formerly
    married to a citizen of France. The judge had accepted  submissions  by
    Mr al-Rashid to the effect that he  was  bound  to  allow  the  appeal,
    because of the way in which a previous appeal by the same appellant (IA
    36369-09), from a decision of Judge Parkash Aujla, had come to  an  end
    before me in 2010. The previous appeal had involved the  re-hearing  of
    the appellant's appeal against refusal of a permanent residence card in
    2009, including oral evidence from him, and a  lengthy  ruling  by  me,
    following a hearing on 26 July 2010, which needs to be set out in  full
    here: Mr al-Rashid represented the appellant,  as  now,  and  the  Home
    Office were represented by Mr Glyn Saunders.

PREVIOUS RULING

      2. Background  The family history is an unusual one, at least  by  the
         standards of these islands. The appellant entered this  country  on
         24 May 2001. On 25 November 2002, he married Roslynn[1] Crosnier de
         Bellaistre, a French citizen. On 8 January 2003 he was issued  with
         a residence permit as her husband, valid till 8 April 2008. On that
         same day he applied for  a  permanent  residence  card,  which  was
         refused on 17 November 2009, the  decision  against  which  he  now
         appeals. The reason  given  was  that  the  Home  Office  were  not
         satisfied on the evidence provided that Roslynn had resided in this
         country in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic Area)
         Regulations 2006 [the EEA Regulations] for those five years.
      3. Meanwhile Alice Toyin Azeez, who  was  to  be  the  mother  of  the
         appellant's children, and is also a citizen of Nigeria, had arrived
         in this country, also in 2001. They met here in 2002, and the first
         of their children, born 6 June 2003, must in the ordinary course of
         nature have been conceived in about  the  previous  September.  Two
         more followed, on 8 November 2004, and 11  May  2008.  However,  in
         March 2003 Alice was married  to  C�dric  Jacques,  also  a  French
         citizen, and on that basis she too  was  issued  with  a  residence
         card, and now apparently has permanent residence in this country.
      4. Both the appellant and Alice gave evidence before  the  judge  that
         they had led normal married lives, one with Roslynn and  the  other
         with C�dric. Alice's with C�dric still  continued,  to  the  extent
         that they spent three nights a  week  together,  and  he  took  her
         children by the appellant to and from school.  In  the  appellant's
         case, he says in his  statement  that  he  and  Roslynn  "...became
         intimate for a short time, and then we decided it was not the  best
         thing to do". Nevertheless they got married; but then the appellant
         told Roslynn he was expecting  a  child  with  Alice.  That  caused
         trouble;  but  when  the  appellant  explained  how   normal   such
         polygamous relationships were in his  culture,  Roslynn  understood
         and agreed, so long as he didn't want to  have  children  with  her
         too.
      5. The appellant said he and Roslynn had  stayed  together  till  July
         2009, when "financial pressures" had driven them apart. He produced
         evidence of her employment in this country till the time  of  their
         separation, to which I shall return. They had  been  good  friends,
         and enjoyed their life together, with only major disagreements over
         children. However  he,  as  well  as  C�dric,  regularly  took  his
         children to  school.  The  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant's
         marriage to Roslynn, and for that matter  Alice's  to  C�dric,  had
         been a marriage of convenience.
      6. Law  Mr al-Rashid conceded, correctly in view of OA (EEA - retained
         right of residence) Nigeria [2010] UKAIT  (see the  judicial  head-
         note paragraph (ii)), that it was not open to this appellant, whose
         marriage had never been ended by any legal proceedings, to rely  on
         reg. 10 of the EEA Regulations as  a  former  family  member  of  a
         'qualified  person',  who  had  retained  the  right  of  residence
         following the termination of his marriage. So  he  can  only  claim
         that right under reg. 15 (1), as
              i. (b) a family member of an EEA national who is  not  himself
                 an EEA national but who has resided in the  United  Kingdom
                 with the EEA national in accordance with these  Regulations
                 for a continuous period of five years
        a. The issue on this part of the case is whether the appellant  did
           indeed live with Roslynn for the five  years  required.  At  one
           point Mr al-Rashid argued that  five  years'  residence  at  any
           stage was enough; but, faced with the obvious absurdity of  such
           a period at some remote date in the past leading to a  right  to
           permanent residence now, he suggested that it should run to  the
           date of the decision. This certainly accords  with  the  present
           perfect ('has resided') of reg. 15 (1) (b).
      7. In this case, the date of the decision under appeal was 17 November
         2009, which might have the unfortunate effect of disqualifying this
         appellant, who had parted company with Roslynn that July;  but  the
         whole period between their marriage and those dates was covered  in
         evidence. As for at least part of that time she  was  working  away
         from home, I will say at once  that,  where  one  spouse  was,  for
         example, only living away during the week, for work  purposes,  but
         coming home at week-ends, then in my view each would be  'residing'
         with the other for the purposes of reg. 15. The regulation, in  the
         words 'in  accordance  with  these  Regulations',  requires  living
         together as man and wife for the period in  question,  and  neither
         just nor merely under the same roof. The only exceptions under  the
         EEA Regulations  themselves,  at  reg.  3  (2),  do  not  help  the
         appellant, as they only deal with absence from the UK altogether.
      8. Mr al-Rashid raised various points of law in his skeleton  argument
         about the judge's marriage of convenience finding.  As  he  pointed
         out, this had not been  part  of  the  Home  Office's  reasons  for
         refusal: those involved the lack of qualifying residence under reg.
         15, and have in any event to be dealt with, so that  was  what  was
         done at the hearing before me. Depending on the result, it may also
         be necessary to deal with article 8 and what may  be  described  as
         the 'after-life' of policy DP 5/96.
      9. Evidence    The appellant confirmed his  witness  statement  of  19
         July: most of it has  been  set  out  in  the  background,  but  at
         paragraph 3 he deals with Roslynn's work record. Cross-examined, he
         said the two of them had lived for about two years after they  were
         married at 104 Iveagh House, Loughborough Rd, London SW9. Then they
         had moved to no 44 in the same building, also for about two  years.
         At this point (about the end  of  2006),  they  had  moved  to  the
         Caledonian Rd for three or four months, though he couldn't remember
         the number. From there, Roslynn had moved to Manchester to work for
         the rest of that year and the next,  though  she  had  returned  to
         London.
     10.  Dealing with Roslynn's time in Manchester, the appellant said  she
         had come and gone between there and him. He couldn't  remember  the
         address at which she had stayed while working there: she was  still
         getting her letters at his place. He was asked about  some  of  the
         documents put in on his behalf, and this is a convenient  point  to
         deal both with those, and with the ones referred to by Mr al-Rashid
         in closing. The documents at 13 - 16 show the  appellant's  address
         as 44 Iveagh House from 2005 till 19 September 2007. That  is  also
         the address shown on Roslynn's P60 for the years to  5  April  2004
         and 2005.
     11. Going on to 2006, a P45 shows Roslynn leaving the employment  of  a
         firm based in Ilford on 17 August; then her P60  to  5  April  2007
         shows her earning a small amount of  money  (under  �900)  with  an
         employment  agency  in  Hyde,  Cheshire,  giving  her  address   in
         Crumpsall, Manchester. A weekly wage-slip from the agency, dated 21
         December 2006, shows her taking home (to an  address  in  Openshaw,
         Manchester) �73.58; and another, from 6 July 2007,  �81.75  to  the
         Crumpsall address.
     12. Roslynn's employment history is taken on in letters to her from
              i. HM Revenue and Customs  on 29 February 2008, to her at  456
                 Caledonian Rd, confirming she has paid tax  for  the  years
                 2003 - 2007 inclusive.
             ii. a business services firm in London SE16: the first, from 25
                 March 2008, gives her address as  456  Caledonian  Rd;  the
                 other, from 13 July 2009,  another  not  mentioned  by  the
                 appellant (but this was around the time when he  says  they
                 split up).  The  first  shows  her  working  as  an  office
                 assistant at �600 a  month  after  tax;  the  second  as  a
                 domestic cleaner, at �8,000 a year, also after tax.
     13. When the appellant was first asked about  Roslynn's  2007  P60,  he
         confirmed that she had been living at the  Crumpsall  address,  and
         nowhere else in Manchester. Then the wage-slip of 21 December 2006,
         showing the Openshaw address, was put to him: to this he said  that
         there had been some kind of argument between them. Reminded that he
         had clearly said she had been living nowhere other than  Crumpsall,
         he replied that he didn't remember. Asked why  he  hadn't  said  he
         didn't remember, when first asked, the appellant said he  had  been
         trying to.
     14. Asked when difficulties between him  and  Roslynn  had  begun,  the
         appellant said it had been in 2009: those in 2006 - 07 (see 13) had
         been no  more  than  arguments.  As  for  what  had  started  their
         differences, he said it had been over  children.  He  was  reminded
         that his eldest child with Alice, Ezekiel, had been born on 6  June
         2003[2], and asked when he had met her. To this he said it had been
         in 2002, several months before their marriage. His separation  from
         Roslynn  had  been  the  result  of  difficulties  over  money  and
         immigration: at one time he had been working himself, but  in  2008
         his residence card had been withdrawn, and so he had had  to  stop,
         after which she had been supporting him.
     15. There was nothing more  in  the  circumstances  from  Roslynn  (the
         statement seen by the judge is  not  included  in  the  appellant's
         present bundle): as for Alice, she had come to  give  evidence  for
         him before, but now his real relationship was with their  children,
         rather than her. The parties' submissions have been included in  my
         treatment of the documents and the law.
     16. Conclusions The real issue is whether the  appellant  was  residing
         (to use the language of the EEA Regulations) with Roslynn in 2006 -
         07. There is nothing  in  the  documents  relating  to  2002  -  06
         themselves to suggest that they were not living together, though Mr
         Saunders invited me to disbelieve the  appellant's  evidence  about
         that, as a matter  of  general  credibility.  On  the  other  hand,
         whether  Mr  al-Rashid's  original  position  (that   five   years'
         residence together at any time after marriage is  enough),  or  his
         second line (that it must run to  the  date  of  the  decision)  is
         right, not living together in 2006  -  07  would  have  broken  the
         necessary continuity.
     17. So far as the evidence about 2007  -  09  is  concerned,  the  2008
         letters, both from the Revenue and  Roslynn's  employers,  give  an
         address at which the appellant says (though without being  able  to
         remember the number) they were living from  the  end  of  2006  for
         three or four months.
     18. Roslynn has been in regular work over the years; but at every  time
         for which I have been referred to any record, in very modestly-paid
         posts, either office or domestic, at no stage earning more than the
         �8,000 a year after tax, given in the 2009 London letter.  Whatever
         led her to go and seek work in Manchester, it  was  not  apparently
         the prospect of large earnings: at least the most she is ever shown
         as taking home there is just over �80 a week in July 2007. This  is
         not the sort of sum which leads women, otherwise inclined  to  live
         with a man as his wife, to go  and  work  away,  even,  or  perhaps
         especially, during the week only.
     19. There is also the appellant's unexplained equivocation  over  where
         Roslynn was living in Manchester: he first  answered  very  clearly
         that it had only been in Crumpsall, and only resorted to saying  he
         didn't  remember  when  confronted  with  the   wage-slip   showing
         Openshaw. While he might not have  had  any  particular  reason  to
         remember an address, if Roslynn had used it only for work  purposes
         during the week, he certainly had no reason not to  say  he  didn't
         remember it.
     20. Then there is the question of  what  had  led  to  the  appellant's
         separation from Roslynn: had it been his  begetting  a  child  with
         Alice? Presumably not, since that child had been conceived the year
         before he married Roslynn. Or had it been money problems, caused by
         Roslynn having to support him, after his residence card expired  in
         2008? Even then, though, she was hardly earning enough  to  support
         two people.
     21. I was also referred to telephone bills for 44 Iveagh  House,  dated
         16 July 2006 and 15 January 2007,  and  in  Roslynn's  name.  Those
         might tally with her and the appellant living there  together  till
         they moved to the Caledonian Rd about that time, if the 22 December
         2006 wage-slip, giving the Openshaw address, only related to  where
         she was during the week. However, these bills have nothing  to  say
         about the situation between Roslynn and the appellant for the  rest
         of 2007;  and  I  have  not  been  referred  to  anything  but  the
         appellant's own evidence about living in the Caledonian Rd to  link
         him with no 456, where she was living by 2008.
     22. Taking together all the evidence about the position from  the  time
         Roslynn left her job with the Ilford firm in August 2006, till  the
         appellant says they split up for good in July 2009, I am  satisfied
         that more likely than not he was not  residing  with  her  (in  the
         sense given at 7) at any point during that  time.  I  am  certainly
         satisfied, for the reasons given at 18 - 20, and  bearing  in  mind
         21,  that  he  was  not  residing  with  her  during  her  time  in
         Manchester, which on the documentary evidence lasted at least  from
         December 2006 till July 2007.
     23. The result is that the  appellant  cannot  succeed  on  his  appeal
         against refusal of a permanent residence card, under reg. 15 of the
         EEA Regulations. While the decision under appeal did not entail his
         removal, if upheld, it did include a  'one-stop  warning'  and  the
         appellant's  notice  of  appeal  to  the  judge  claimed  that  the
         consequences of the decision would involve a breach of  article  8,
         not in terms of his "private and family life" with Alice and  their
         children, but simply because of his claim for  permanent  residence
         as a result of his marriage to Roslynn.
     24. That claim has now been disposed of, and on a basis which leaves it
         clear that the appellant can have no article 8 right to  remain  in
         connexion with Roslynn. While it may be  questionable  how  far  it
         ought to be open to him to argue,  on  this  appeal,  a  completely
         separate set of rights, in connexion with  Alice  or  his  children
         with her, that seems to have been taken for granted throughout  the
         progress of this appeal so far. On general principle, it is open to
         the appellant to argue article 8 on an  appeal  not  involving  any
         present decision to remove: see TE (Eritrea) [2009] EWCA  Civ  174.
         Whether that position  is  affected  by  the  explanation  of  that
         decision by Moses LJ in Mirza [2010] EWHC (Admin) 2002 will also be
         open to argument.
     25. It does not seem to me that the  point  taken  in  the  appellant's
         skeleton argument on the former seven-year rule (DP  5/96:  see  NF
         (Ghana) [2008] EWCA Civ 906) is open to him, because  his  children
         with Alice do  not  face  removal  in  any  event,  since  she  has
         permanent residence as a result of her marriage to C�dric.
     26. So far however the appellant has put  no  written  article  8  case
         before the Home Office about Alice or his children with her. A full
         witness statement by the  appellant  (and  one  by  Alice,  if  any
         continuing relationship with her is to be relied on) must be  filed
         and served by  1  September,  setting  out  the  history  of  their
         relationship and its current position, especially relating  to  the
         children, together with copies of any reports or letters from their
         schools to be put in evidence. All this material should  appear  in
         the form of a fresh numbered and indexed  bundle.  Following  this,
         the appeal will be re-listed for hearing on article 8 only.
SUBSEQUENT HISTORY

 2. For no reason that I have been able to discover,  the  previous  appeal
    was not re-listed as I had directed,  till  2012.  By  this  time,  two
    'reported' decisions of the Upper Tribunal had  come  out,  PM  (EEA  -
    spouse - 'residing with') Turkey [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC) and Idezuna  (EEA
    -permanent  residence)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  474   (IAC),   and   the
    appellant's lawyers had made representations about their effect to  the
    Home Office. These resulted in a number of adjournments  for  the  Home
    Office to consider them, the last being on 6 November, when  there  was
    no appearance for the appellant.

 3. On 6 December 2012 Miss Julie Isherwood, who had been representing  the
    Home Office in that year's proceedings, wrote to me, referring  to  the
    appeal having last been adjourned for that reason, and  "...  to  allow
    the respondent  further  time  to  consider  whether  the  EEA  refusal
    stands". Miss Isherwood asked  for  "...  permission  to  withdraw  the
    refusal decision of the 17 November 2009 in accordance with R. 17(1)(a)
    of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules. This would allow a full and more
    up-to-date assessment of the appellant's position".

 4. When that letter reached me,  on  28  December  2012,  I  consented  to
    withdrawal of the appeal under r. 17 (2), with the proviso, under r. 17
    (3), that "Failing any application  by the respondent to reinstate  his
    or her case by one month from today, the appeal will stand allowed, but
    no further direction will be given". There is in my view only one plain
    and obvious meaning to this order: the appellant's appeal  against  the
    decision set out in the refusal letter of 17 November 2009 was allowed;
    but there would be no direction to the Home Office to issue him with  a
    permanent residence card. Equally clearly, that left  the  Home  Office
    free to make a further decision, subject to a further right  of  appeal
    for the appellant, as to whether he should have  a  residence  card  or
    not.

 5. That decision was made by way of a 'notice  of  immigration  decision',
    dated 3 January  2013.  The  decision  itself  did  not  refer  to  any
    explanatory refusal letter, and refused the appellant's application for
    a permanent residence card on the following grounds [my lettering]: the
    appellant

        a) had not provided evidence that Roslynn had resided in the UK  in
           accordance  with  reg.  15(1)(a)  for  the  necessary  five-year
           period; and

        b) had not resided in the UK with Roslynn for five years.

    On the same day the usual appeal bundle was compiled and  sent  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal. The index of documents (on the form known as  PF1)
    included both the refusal letter of 17 November 2009 (annex N) and  the
    one of 3 January 2013 (not numbered). However  the  3  January  refusal
    letter was not  included in the bundle.

 6. This was the form in which the case came before Judge Grant on  1  May.
    He set out the history of the  previous  appeal,  and  alluded  to  the
    effect of PM and Idezuna, to which I shall now come. The judicial head-
    note of PM , a decision written by Blake J, in which  two  other  Upper
    Tribunal judges took part, is as follows:

       Regulation 15(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
       Regulations 2006 applies to those  who  entered  a  genuine  marriage
       where both parties have resided in the United Kingdom for five  years
       since the marriage; the EEA national's  spouse  has  resided  as  the
       family member of a qualified person or otherwise in  accordance  with
       the  Regulations  and  the  marriage  has  not  been  dissolved.  The
       "residing with" requirement relates to presence in the  UK;  it  does
       not require living in a common family home.

 7. The judicial head-note in Idezuna is less succinct,  but  this  is  the
    relevant part:

       1) Typically, the focus in EEA appeals involving family members is on
       either or both (i) the  nature  of  the  relationship  with  the  EEA
       national/Union citizen; and (ii) the  question  of  whether  the  EEA
       national/Union citizen has been exercising Treaty rights  in  the  UK
       over the relevant  period.  What  constitutes  the  relevant  period,
       however, may be  a  matter  requiring  particular  consideration  and
       sometimes a family member may have  acquired  a  right  of  permanent
       residence on the basis of historical facts.  In the present case, for
       example, once  the  appellant  had  established  that  his  wife  was
       exercising Treaty rights for five continuous years since the date  of
       marriage (and before he was divorced), then (subject to (d) below) he
       was from that date someone who had a  right  of  permanent  residence
       which could not be broken by absence from the UK unless in excess  of
       two years.

 8. Since this appellant was not divorced from  Roslynn  till  22  February
    2013 (I saw a  copy  of  the  decree  absolute),  those  decisions,  if
    followed in the present case, would result in his being entitled  to  a
    permanent residence card, so long as

        a) both of them had lived in this country for a  continuous  period
           of five years between their marriage on  25  November  2002  and
           that date: this is not in dispute; and

        b) their marriage was genuine  at  its  inception,  meaning  not  a
           marriage of convenience.

    It is Judge Grant's treatment of point (b) which  led  to  the  present
    appeal.

 9. At paragraph 6 Judge Grant noted, correctly, that

        a) the decision challenged in the previous appeal had been based on
           whether Roslynn was a 'qualified person'; but

        b) Judge Aujla had found against the appellant [at least  in  part]
           on the basis that his  marriage  to  Roslynn  had  been  one  of
           convenience, without  this  issue  having  been  raised  at  the
           hearing before him; so

        c) permission to appeal had been given on that basis; but

        d) on 30 June 2010 directions had been given in the Upper  Tribunal
           (by Judge Anne Murray) for a resumed hearing, on  the  basis  of
           "All  issues  at  large  including  the  issue  of  whether  the
           Appellant's marriage is a marriage of convenience"; and

        e) that was the basis on which the previous appeal had come  before
           me.

10. Judge Grant went on there to note, more contentiously as it turned out,
    that at my hearing "Mr Saunders could have raised, but  did  not  raise
    the issue of marriage of  convenience".  After  setting  out  what  had
    followed, he made his own decision on the result as follows:

    9.  Instead  of  applying  for  reinstatement  under  rule  17  (3)  the
       respondent has purported to issue a new decision. I agree with Mr Al-
       Rashid's  submission  that  the  procedural  rules   are   meant   to
       facilitate fairness. Mr Saunders made no submissions on the basis  of
       marriage  of  convenience.  I  find  that  the  respondent  has   now
       attempted to bypass  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  has  issued  a  fresh
       decision which raises marriage of convenience.
   10. I went through the possible steps which might have been taken had SJ
       [sc. Senior Immigration Judge]  Freeman  not  given  more  time  for
       Article 8 issues. Mr Al-Rashid stated that the appellant would  have
       filed a fresh application. He also pointed  out  that  the  original
       notice  of  decision  did  not  raise  the  issue  of  marriage   of
       convenience.  This  was  an  issue  raised  entirely  by   IJ   [sc.
       Immigration Judge] Aujla.

   11. I find that the  respondent  has  in  failing  to  comply  with  the
       requirements of rule 17 issued a notice of decision which is not  in
       accordance with the law.

11. Miss Isherwood's application for permission to  appeal  refers  to  her
    letter of 6 December, and the terms of my order of  28  December  2012,
    and goes on to refer to Judge Grant's decision in this way:

       It can be seen from paragraph 6 ...  that  the  appellant  has  never
       received an allowed decision  that  permits  him  to  have  permanent
       residency [sic]  in  the  UK  and  that  the  issue  of  marriage  of
       convenience was raised by both a Judge and a Presenting Officer  [sc.
       Mr Saunders].

       The judge materially erred in failing to address the issues raised in
       this appeal and to consider  whether  the  appellant  meets  the  EEA
       regulations. The respondent requested permission (which was  granted)
       to look at the case  again  and  having  done  that  issued  a  fresh
       refusal. There has been no attempt by the respondent  to  bypass  the
       Upper Tribunal.

PRESENT ISSUES

12. Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier  Tribunal  on  those
    grounds, and directions given in the Upper  Tribunal  for  the  present
    appeal to be re-listed before me, for obvious reasons. I  have  already
    made clear at 4 what I consider the equally obvious effect of my  order
    of 28 December 2012: once the Home Office had chosen not  to  apply  to
    reinstate their 2009 decision, it left them free to make a  fresh  one,
    which they did on 3 January 2013.

13. There was nothing in my 2010  ruling  to  provide  any  basis  for  the
    appellant's appeal to be allowed on its merits: if there had been, then
    I should have made it clear that he was to be issued with  a  residence
    card, or further directions would be given. I found against him on what
    at the time I considered to be  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 [the  EEA  Regulations],  and
    only held back from giving a final  decision,  dismissing  his  appeal,
    because of the obvious possibility of an article 8 claim based on Alice
    and his children with her.

14. There was nothing except the potential effect of PM   and  Idezuna   to
    provide any basis for the appeal to be allowed on its merits under  the
    EEA Regulations; and the Home Office, having asked a  number  of  times
    during 2012 for the hearing to be further adjourned, so that they could
    consider that  effect,  appeared  last  December  to  have  decided  to
    withdraw  their  previous  decision,  for  that  purpose.   Since   the
    appellant, who was paying for his  own  representation,  had  not  been
    present or represented on the last occasion  when  the  case  had  come
    before me, rather than draw out the proceedings  further,  I  made  the
    order of 28 December.

15. While it would have been not only possible,  but  desirable  for  Judge
    Grant to take any findings of fact I had made in my 2010 ruling as  his
    starting-point, no-one so far had given any judicial  consideration  to
    the effect on them of PM  and Idezuna; and at the least he needed to do
    that. There is also the question of whether he needed to deal with  the
    marriage of convenience point, to which I shall now come.  If  I  found
    for the Home Office on that, then  there  would  need  to  be  a  fresh
    hearing on the evidence to deal with it, which would have to take place
    before another judge of the First-tier Tribunal, since  the  point  was
    not considered on its merits by Judge Grant at all, and  would  require
    close examination of the parties' actions, going back to 2002.

16. On the other hand, if I find for the appellant, then I can go on to re-
    make the decision on the  EEA  Regulations  on  the  basis  of  my  own
    findings of fact, in the light of PM  and Idezuna: Mr al-Rashid told me
    he was content to take his stand on this appeal on that basis,  without
    any re-hearing of the evidence.

MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE

17. I first refer to paragraph 8 of my 2010 ruling, set out  above,  as  to
    what I considered to be the issues before me then. Mr Wilding  referred
    me to a file note by his colleague Mr Saunders, made on 6  August  that
    year (as it happened, the same day I signed my decision). The  relevant
    parts read

       The appellant adopted his statement, and gave further poor  evidence,
       especially  in  respect  of  his  wife's  period  of  employment   at
       Manchester, in 2006-7.

       I submitted that he failed to meet the requirements of 15 (1) (b)  of
       the 2006 Regs. I made  further  submissions  about  the  marriage  of
       convenience point, but I am less optimistic as to that issue.

18. Perhaps Mr Saunders may have thought  he  had  drawn  the  marriage  of
    convenience point to my attention; but it is quite clear that he,  like
    me, and probably Mr al-Rashid too, were concentrating on the continuity
    of Roslynn's residence with the appellant, and whether it was broken by
    her sojourn in Manchester.  While  there  were  clearly  a  great  many
    features of the case, not least the  appellant's  history  with  Alice,
    which were capable of casting a good deal of suspicion on  his  motives
    for marrying  Roslynn,  to  have  pursued  this  point  effectively  Mr
    Saunders would have needed to  cross-examine  him,  not  just  on  what
    happened when she got the job in Manchester in 2006, but on  the  whole
    history of their marriage from 2002.

19. Going on to my order of 28 December 2012, there  had  been  nothing  in
    Miss Isherwood's letter of the 6th (see 3) to suggest that the marriage
    of convenience point was to be taken in any fresh  decision:  if  there
    had been, I should certainly  not  have  allowed  the  Home  Office  to
    withdraw their previous one, since any judicial decision on that  point
    would have needed to be made on the basis of the findings of fact I had
    already, at some length, reached; but taken as a  whole  together  with
    additional ones on  issues  I  had  not  considered.  That  could  only
    reasonably have  been  done  by  insisting  that  the  previous  appeal
    proceeded to a final decision before me.

20. While I have given rather different reasons on this  point  from  those
    adopted by Judge Grant, I have no doubt that he was right in the result
    he reached, which was that the reliance by the Home Office on  marriage
    of convenience in the present appeal was  an  abuse  of  the  appellate
    process.

21. That decision also avoids the obvious difficulties for the appellant in
    meeting whatever case the Home Office chose to make on that point  (and
    their reasoned refusal letter, as already pointed out, was  not  before
    Judge Grant), on the basis of what he and Roslynn, with whom he  is  no
    longer in touch, might have done in 2002. That is not the basis for  my
    decision; but it confirms my view that it is not now in  the  interests
    of justice  to  allow  the  Home  Office  to  pursue  the  marriage  of
    convenience point.

EEA REGULATIONS

22. On my previous findings of fact, which neither side sought to challenge
    in this appeal, both the  appellant  and  Roslynn  had  lived  in  this
    country for considerably more than five years between their marriage in
    2002 and their divorce in 2013. PM  is a  Presidential  decision,  and,
    though it is not 'starred',  I  consider  that,  in  the  interests  of
    certainty for all concerned, I ought to follow it, unless there is some
    good reason for distinguishing it in the present case.

23. These were the Tribunal's conclusions in PM :

   34. We recognise that the fact that spouses or civil partners decide not
       to live together in a common household, may sometimes invite inquiry
       into the nature of the relationship.
   35. No such inquiry could possibly arise in this case, where  there  has
       been genuine matrimonial cohabitation for some  time,  a  child  has
       been born to the couple and there are continuing social relations by
       the parties to the marriage in  the  context  of  contact  with  the
       child.
   36. The EEA Regulations (reg 2(1)) precludes those who are  party  to  a
       marriage of convenience from being a spouse and therefore  a  family
       member under reg 7. As recital 28 of the  Citizens  Directive  makes
       clear, a marriage of convenience is an abuse of rights but it  is  a
       term strictly limited to  relationships  "contracted  for  the  sole
       purpose" of enjoying free movement  rights  and  with  no  effective
       social nexus between  the  parties.  An  inference  of  marriage  of
       convenience cannot arise solely because a  married  couple  are  not
       living in the same household.
   37. However, for the reasons we have given above, we conclude  that  reg
       15(1)(b) applies to those who entered a genuine marriage where  both
       parties have resided in the United Kingdom for five years since  the
       marriage; the EEA national's spouse has resided as the family member
       of  a  qualified  person  or  otherwise  in  accordance   with   the
       Regulations and the marriage has not been dissolved.

27.  Whatever  the  differences  in  the  quality   of   this   appellant's
    relationship with Roslynn, and that of the parties in PM  ,  I  do  not
    think they provide any proper basis for distinguishing  that  decision.
    The reason is that it holds that the EEA Regulations, and the  Citizens
    Directive  on  which  those  are  based,  only  exclude  marriages   of
    convenience, meaning "relationships "contracted for the  sole  purpose"
    of enjoying free movement rights and with  no  effective  social  nexus
    between the parties"; and whether that is so or not in the present case
    is not a point which the Home Office have properly taken.

28. It follows that this appeal has now to be allowed on its merits,  under
    the EEA Regulations. I do not suppose for one moment that the  ordinary
    person would have any more enthusiasm for this result than I do; but it
    is one which I consider myself compelled by PM  to reach. If I regarded
    myself as free to treat PM  as wrongly decided, I  should  need  to  go
    into the basis for the conclusions set out at paragraphs 34 - 37.

29. I shall do so briefly in any event, because it is not  impossible  that
    this case may go further. The basis for the Tribunal's decision on  the
    terms of reg. 15 themselves was as follows:

     38.  Turning to reg 15 itself, we are struck with the contrast  between
         15(1)(a) and (b). If the IJ's conclusion is correct then  (assuming
         in both cases that the EEA  national  has  resided  in  the  United
         Kingdom in accordance with  these  Regulations)  there  is  a  very
         significant difference in treatment of family members depending  on
         their nationality.  A French spouse of an Italian national  obtains
         permanent residence without any requirement to reside with the  EEA
         national. A Turkish spouse, such as the appellant, can never obtain
         permanent residence if the EEA spouse never  established  a  common
         matrimonial home or moves out of it before the expiry of the period
         of five years. Such a startling distinction in treatment  would  be
         very surprising when the basic definition of family member  affords
         no decisive importance to the nationality of that person.
     39. Moreover, it is common ground that no distinction is  made  on  the
         grounds of the nationality of  the  family  member  who  obtains  a
         permanent right of residence in the circumstances set  out  in  reg
         15(1)(b) (e) or (f).  Thus in the circumstances set  out  in  those
         provisions a non-EEA national wife may achieve permanent  residence
         when the EEA national ceases working, dies,  or  divorces  her.  In
         none of these cases is the permanent right of  residence  dependent
         on residence in a common family home, and the  period  of  retained
         residence in the United Kingdom may  in  certain  circumstances  be
         shorter than  three  years.   Regulation  15(1)(f)  refers  to  the
         retained right of residence that is further provided for.
     40. In short if the IJ's construction of reg  15(1)(b)  is  correct  it
         would result in anomalous and discriminatory treatment of the  non-
         EEA national spouse who could not or would not  get  a  divorce  to
         terminate the marriage.
     41. There is no reason to  believe  that  this  is  what  the  national
         legislator intended to achieve and every reason to believe that  it
         would be a result intended to be avoided.

27. If free to do so, I should have regarded it as doubtful at best, either
    whether Regulations intended to enact the legislation  of  an  economic
    area designed to promote freedom of movement for  its  citizens  should
    have necessarily been regarded as unlikely to discriminate between them
    and others; or whether there was anything objectionable,  either  under
    that legislation or international law, in discriminating in that way.

28. This view is strengthened by the terms of the EEA  legislation  itself,
    as set out in the Citizens Directive with which the Tribunal in PM   go
    on to deal.

    42. Article 16.1 provides "Union citizens who have resided legally  for
        a continuous period of five years in the host  Member  State  shall
        have the right of permanent residence there. This right  shall  not
        be subject to the conditions provided for in chapter III."
    43. Article 16.2 continues "Paragraph 1  shall  apply  also  to  family
        members who are not nationals of a Member State  and  have  resided
        with the Union citizen in the host Member State  for  a  continuous
        period of five years".
    44. The French text is in the following terms:
                  "2. Le paragraphe 1 s'applique �galement aux membres de la
                  famille qui n'ont pas la nationalit� d'un �tat  membre  et
             qui ont
                  s�journ� l�galement pendant une p�riode ininterrompue de
                  cinq ans avec le citoyen de  l'Union  dans  l'�tat  membre
             d'accueil."

29.    If the Council  of  Ministers  said  "...  resided  with   the  Union
    citizen", and used equivalent words in the French text, then to my mind
    they should be treated as meaning it: whatever justification  is  found
    for any other result, as a matter of construction it comes  dangerously
    close to the well-known rule, propounded by no less an  authority  than
    Lewis Carroll[3]. However,  for  the  reasons  already  given,  I  have
    reached the following result.

Appeal
Direction for issue of permanent residence card to  appellant,  failing  any
    further appeal
