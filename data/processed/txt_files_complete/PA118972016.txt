                           Decision and Directions


 1. In her decision signed on 13 June 2017 and promulgated on 7 July  2017,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce set aside the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Suffield-Thompson to dismiss the  applicant's  appeal  on
    human rights grounds.

 2. On an unspecified date, Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson, as resident  judge
    and acting under delegated powers, approved a request  by  Judge  Bruce
    for a direction, pursuant to para 9.1 of the  Practice  Statements  for
    the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and  the
    Upper Tribunal (the "Practice Statements"), that this appeal  be  heard
    by a differently constituted Tribunal, it having been indicated to  the
    resident judge that Judge Bruce was not available until 1  August  2017
    to hear this appeal.

 3. Thus this case came before me as a resumed hearing on 23 August 2017.

 4. Having been seised of this appeal, I considered whether to  remit  this
    case to the First-tier Tribunal or re-make the decision on the  appeal,
    pursuant to my duty under section 12(2)(b) of the Tribunals, Courts and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

 5. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision will be able to re-make the relevant decision itself. However,
    para 7.2 of the Practice Statements  recognises  that  it  may  not  be
    possible for the Upper Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when
    it is satisfied that:

         "(a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

 6. I noted that Judge Suffield-Thompson upheld the certificate under  s.72
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. For  this  reason,
    the appellant's appeal was dismissed on asylum  grounds.  However,  the
    factual basis of his asylum claim fell to be considered in relation  to
    his appeal on humanitarian protection grounds and his appeal  on  human
    rights grounds (Article 3). In the instant case, this  necessitated  an
    assessment of the appellant's credibility.

 7. At para 34 of her decision, Judge Suffield-Thompson said that,  as  she
    had found that the appellant's continued presence was not conducive  to
    the public good, she did not need to consider  the  asylum  claim.  She
    said that, for the sake of clarity, she did not find  the  appellant  a
    credible witness. She did not give any reasons at all for  her  adverse
    credibility finding. She said that, had the appellant not  met  section
    72(2), she would have dismissed the asylum claim based on her  negative
    credibility finding.

 8. It is evident that not only did Judge Suffield-Thompson  fail  to  give
    any reasons at all for her adverse credibility  finding,  she  did  not
    engage with the factual basis of the appellant's asylum claim in  order
    to decide whether the appellant's removal would be  in  breach  of  his
    Article 3 or whether there would be a real risk of serious harm  if  he
    is removed  from  the  United  Kingdom.  Accordingly,  in  effect,  the
    appellant was deprived of the opportunity of  a  fair  hearing  of  his
    protection claim. I am satisfied  that  para  7.2(a)  of  the  Practice
    Statements applies. I am also satisfied that para 7.2(b) applies.

 9. For the reasons given above, this case falls within  para  7.2  of  the
    Practice Statements, in my judgment. In addition, having regard to  the
    Court of Appeal's judgment in JD (Congo) & Others [2012] EWCA Civ  327,
    I am of the view that a remittal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  the
    right course of action. The parties agreed.

Notice of Decision

This case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  the  decision  on  the
appellant's appeal on  humanitarian  protection  grounds  and  human  rights
grounds to be re-made by a Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  other  than
Judge Suffield-Thompson.
