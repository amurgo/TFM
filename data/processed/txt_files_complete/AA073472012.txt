Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr T Hodson, instructed by Elder Rahimi Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Sayed Reza Kiaei, date of birth 30.5.77, is a citizen of
    Iran.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Levin promulgated 16.12.14, dismissing his appeal against the decisions
    of the respondent to refuse his  asylum,  humanitarian  protection  and
    human rights claims, and to refuse him leave to enter the  UK  pursuant
    to the Immigration Act 1971.  The Judge heard the appeal on 9.12.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Kamara  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.1.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find no material error of law  in  the
    making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    determination of Judge Levin should be set aside.

 6. There is an unfortunate lengthy history to this appeal,  which  can  be
    summarised as follows. The appellant came to  the  UK  on  30.6.12  and
    claimed asylum on arrival at Heathrow Airport. The Secretary  of  State
    refused his claim on 31.7.12.

 7. The appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    was heard on 5.9.12 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davies, who  dismissed
    the appeal. Permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted.
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Harris found errors of law in the making of
    the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Davies  and  remitted  the
    appeal to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. The appeal next came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever on 20.8.13.
    In his decision dated 2.9.13, Judge Lever dismissed  the  appeal.  Once
    again, permission was granted to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  In  his
    decision, Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley found  errors  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  remitted  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

 9. Then, as stated above, the appeal then came before First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Levin, who dismissed the appeal, and subsequently permission  was
    granted to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

10. The grounds of appeal complain that:

      a)  Judge  Levin  went  behind  a  finding  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         Chalkley;

      b) Judge Levin fell into procedural impropriety in his questioning  of
         the appellant;

      c) Judge Levin failed to take account  of  submissions  and  case  law
         regarding reliance on the contents of the screening interview;

      d) Judge Levin failed to take into  account  corroborating  background
         evidence.

11. The primary focus of Mr Hodson's submissions relates to the nature  and
    description of a yellow document allegedly handed  to  the  appellant's
    mother following a search of the family home. For the purpose  of  this
    appeal I will refer to it as an inventory.

12. The previous grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal alleged that Judge
    Lever had failed to properly identify that document,  referring  to  it
    variously as a  search  or  seizure  warrant,  or  summons,  or  search
    warrant. It was claimed that by failing to understand the  document  is
    an inventory the judge materially erred in law. At  the  error  of  law
    hearing before Judge Chalkley, Mr Harrison for the Secretary  of  State
    accepted that First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lever  had  erred  in  law  in
    failing to understand that the document is an inventory. Judge Chalkley
    stated, "The significance of this is that, of course, it may very  well
    have been produced before the raid,  rather  than  after  it,  and  the
    background evidence  which  the  judge  considers  relating  to  search
    warrants and summonses, is to that extent irrelevant."

13. With respect to Judge Chalkley, it is not clear that he has grasped the
    point being made by Mr Hodson in the appeal grounds. Further, there  is
    an evident mistake in the error of law decision, in that the contention
    of the appellant is that the inventory was produced after  the  search,
    when the officers returned to the family home and gave this yellow copy
    of the  completed  document  to  the  appellant's  mother.  It  is  not
    contended that it was produced before the  raid,  as  Judge  Chalkley's
    error of law decision asserts.

14. The appellant's claim as it now  stands  is  that  on  the  evening  of
    13.3.12 he was attended the Chadar Sharibe Soori celebrations, an event
    which takes place about a  week  before  the  start  of  the  New  Year
    (Nowruz). People were lighting fires and  setting  off  fireworks.  The
    security services arrived and began to break up the celebration beating
    the participants. The  appellant  joined  a  group  who  were  shouting
    slogans and throwing things at the officers. On the spur of the moment,
    he pulled down a poster and set light to it. His friend who helped  him
    do this was arrested, but  he  managed  to  escape  and  went  to  stay
    overnight at the house of a friend. However, in the  early  morning  of
    the following day, 14.3.12, his mother called him to warn him that  the
    authorities had been to his aunt's home looking for him. The  appellant
    then made arrangements to leave Iran. Meanwhile,  it  is  claimed  that
    later the same day the officers came back to get the appellant's mother
    to sign the inventory and left a copy with her, the yellow document now
    on the case file.

15. There is an issue, to which I will return as to what the appellant said
    in his screening interview about these events, as to whether it was  at
    the Nowruz, which is what was recorded, or the  Chadar  Sharibe  Soori,
    and as to whether he hit back at the security officers.

16. There is also an issue as to when the search, in which items listed  in
    the inventory were removed, took place and when the inventory copy  was
    given to the appellant's mother.

17. The grounds complain that Judge Levin wrong referred to  the  inventory
    as a combined search warrant and inventory and in doing so went  behind
    the finding in Judge Chalkley's error of law decision that the document
    in question is an inventory. There is  no  merit  in  this  submission,
    regardless of my other error of law findings. I do not accept  that  in
    finding an error of law in the making of Judge Lever's decision,  Judge
    Chalkley made  a  factual  finding  intended  to  bind  the  First-tier
    Tribunal when remaking the decision.  Indeed,  Judge  Chalkley  stated,
    "The evidence needs to be carefully examined and clear findings of fact
    will be required. It will be necessary for the judge dealing with  this
    appeal to look carefully at the documents relied upon by the  appellant
    and to make clear findings on them." I find that Judge Levin had a free
    hand to do exactly that and make his own findings on the documents.

18. In questioning the appellant about this document, as recorded at �30 of
    the decision, Judge Levin  noted  that  the  appellant  identified  the
    yellow document as the search warrant and inventory. There was  also  a
    smaller, white, document which is said to be  a  summons.  Judge  Levin
    recorded, "He also accepted that  the  yellow  document  was  a  search
    warrant upon which the  authorities  had  recorded  the  property  they
    removed during the search. I find that the  appellant's  evidence  that
    the document was a search warrant was significant given that at page  3
    of his grounds against Judge Lever's decision, which were settled by Mr
    Hodson, the appellant maintained that Judge Lever's  finding  that  the
    document was a search warrant  constituted  an  error  of  law  and  in
    paragraph 3 of his decision Upper Tribunal Judge  Chalkley  found  that
    Judge Lever had made an error in so finding."

19. The current grounds of application for permission  to  appeal  complain
    that it was only in answer to a leading question from  the  judge  that
    the appellant agreed with the judge's own original suggestion that  the
    document was a combined search warrant and inventory. "This is a  point
    which involves procedural impropriety on the part of the  FTJ."  It  is
    claimed that the appellant's answer was in response  to  pressure  from
    the judge to agree with his  characterisation  of  the  document  as  a
    combined search warrant and inventory and that the judge was seeking to
    get the  appellant  to  agree  to  the  judge's  pre-formed  theory  or
    understanding which was wholly illegitimate and not open to either  the
    judge to adopt or the appellant to unwillingly agree to, in view of the
    findings of Judge Chalkley.

20. I have already found that the First-tier  Tribunal  was  not  bound  by
    anything stated by Judge Chalkley and observed that he  seems  to  have
    misunderstood the relevance of the evidence on this  issue.  I  do  not
    find that the evidence adduced by Mr Hodson demonstrates,  as  claimed,
    procedural impropriety. I note the record of the questioning  submitted
    by Mr Hodson at R14. I can see that Mr Hodson  took  objection  to  the
    questioning, but it is clear that the  appellant's  first  response  on
    this was to agree with the judge's understanding that it was  a  search
    warrant and a list of items  seized.  It  was  perfectly  open  to  the
    appellant to disagree to that first question (Q20). However,  after  Mr
    Hodson's complaint about the questioning, the appellant  was  asked  to
    explain why he agreed with the judge that it was a search  warrant.  He
    replied (Q22) "because it is written down in that paper." Asked  again,
    whether he was familiar with what it says and asked where does  it  say
    warrant, the appellant replied, " It refers to part of law referring to
    search warrant." It follows  that  it  is  quite  clear  that  both  in
    questions from the judge and Mr Hodson, the appellant  maintained  that
    the document was a search warrant with a list of items seized. For  the
    reasons set out herein, I also find that there  is  no  merit  in  this
    ground of appeal and that it really matters not  how  the  document  is
    described. That is because the judge's only reliance  on  its  contents
    was in relation to the issue of the timing of the search.

21. A translation of the  inventory  appears  at  P17  in  the  appellant's
    bundle. Relying on the translation, one can see that it is not  titled,
    but refers to being 'minutes.' However,  it  is  significant  that  the
    translation states quite clearly that the security officer attended  at
    the address at 10:40 on 14.3.12, i.e. in the morning of  the  following
    day, and not during the night as claimed, either  around  midnight,  or
    some time prior  to  his  mother's  call  to  him  between  5-6am.  The
    translation states that the house was searched in the presence  of  Mrs
    Farkhondeh Shir Khan, the appellant's mother, and  articles  listed  in
    the section below were seized for further investigation.

22. Mr Hodson told me that there was some concern with the quality of  this
    translation, and suggested that timing I have referred  to  related  to
    when the officers returned to give the appellant's mother a copy of it.
    However, as this is the only translation submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant I have to proceed on the basis that it is  accurate  when  it
    records that the search began when the officers attended at  the  house
    at 10:40am. Mr Hodson cannot get round this clear indication.

23. As stated, the relevance is that Judge Levin recalled at �35  that  the
    incident of tearing down the poster took place in his estimation  about
    10pm on the 13.3.12 and that it was therefore highly unlikely that  the
    authorities would have obtained a court order to search the appellant's
    mother's  home  by  around  midnight.  The  judge  found   of   greater
    significance is that the inventory records that  the  search  began  at
    10.40am on 14.3.12, not around midnight and a considerable  time  after
    the appellant's mother allegedly telephoned him between 5-6am  to  tell
    him that security officers searched the home during the middle  of  the
    night. The translation of his mother's letter (P12)  also  states  that
    the search took place at around midnight, though the  translator  noted
    an alternative translation of "or in the middle of the night."

24. At �36 Judge Levin  notes  that  this  inconsistency  was  put  to  the
    appellant at the appeal hearing, and his explanation was  that  10.40am
    was when the officers returned to ask his mother to sign the inventory.
    The judge noted that the appellant's witness statement recorded that he
    had been told by his uncle that the document was given to his mother on
    the night. Judge Levin relied on this inconsistency in his  credibility
    findings, concluding at  �39  that  the  appellant's  account  was  not
    credible and that the appellant's claim that the  authorities  returned
    the later the same day with the completed document for her to  sign,  a
    fact not mentioned in his mother's letter, was a "fabrication in a vain
    attempt to explain the clear inconsistency on the face  of  the  search
    warrant as to the time of the search...I find that  this  inconsistency
    fundamentally undermines the credibility of the search warrant."

25. I find Judge Levin made a carefully  assessment  of  all  the  relevant
    evidence on this issue and made clear findings of fact which were  open
    to  him  (notwithstanding  the  submissions  in  the  grounds  to   the
    contrary), for which cogent reasons have been given in the decision. Mr
    Hodson  was  unable  to  identify  to  me  why  the  alleged  error  in
    description of the inventory was relevant at all. It is not the case as
    Judge Chalkley appears to have thought that  it  was  relevant  to  the
    background evidence as to the issue of search  warrants,  etc.,  a  not
    uncommon feature of many asylum appeals. I find  that  in  reality  the
    dispute as to what the document was called is  a  red  herring  and  an
    irrelevance to the material discrepancy relied on by  Judge  Levin.  In
    the circumstances there is no error  of  law  in  this  regard  and  no
    procedural impropriety by the judge. He was entitled to  rely  on  this
    obvious and still present discrepancy to consider that the  credibility
    of the appellant's account was seriously undermined.

26. The remaining issues revolve around the judge's reliance  on  what  the
    appellant stated in his Screening Interview or SEF form. I accept  that
    the purpose of this interview is to establish the general nature of the
    appellant's case and is not intended to be a detailed statement of  his
    claim. However, Mr Hodson concedes that case law indicates that  asylum
    seekers are nevertheless expected to tell the truth. In this  regard  I
    was referred to the case of YL (Rely on SEF) China [2004] UKAIT  00145.
    Further YL states that it is open to a judge to compare  answers  given
    in that interview with those given elsewhere.  The  starting  point  is
    that the SEF or Screening Interview is an accurate statement and if  it
    is not, it is incumbent on the asylum seeker to give a full and  proper
    explanation for any deficiency at an early stage.

27. Judge Levin noted discrepancies between the appellant's  later  account
    and his Screening Interview account as to  when  the  events  described
    took place. The appellant had stated that he was celebrating  Iran  New
    Year but 10 days later he claimed it was at Chadar Sharibe Soori, which
    the judge accepted takes place  about  a  week  before  the  new  year.
    Although it had not been accepted by the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
    refusal decision, the judge accepted the  background  information  that
    the Chadar Sharibe Soori celebrations of 13.3.12 in Tehran were  broken
    by the use of force by the authorities. This sort of discrepancy is not
    explicable by the limited nature of the screening interview.  The  date
    when crucial events are alleged to have taken place  is  a  fundamental
    part of the claim.

28. When challenged on this discrepancy, the  appellant  claimed  that  his
    reply in the screening interview had been wrongly recorded  and  denied
    stating that the incident took place at the New  Year  celebration.  At
    �24 the judge gave detailed and  careful  reasons  for  rejecting  this
    explanation, noting that there is no similarity  between  'Nowruz'  and
    'Chadar Sharibe Soori.' The judge stated that he found  this  to  be  a
    material inconsistency which damaged the appellant's  credibility.  The
    judge also, at �25 rejected Mr Hodson's submission that there as  there
    were two inconsistencies, the second relating to whether the  appellant
    hit back at the security officers breaking up  the  celebrations,  this
    necessarily rendered the record unreliable.

29. In the circumstances, I do not  find  the  judge's  reliance  on  these
    particular discrepancies to be unfair or contrary to case law guidance.



30. The balance of the concerns raised in the grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  such  as  not  giving  the
    appellant credit for being right as to the fact that the Chadar Sharibe
    Soori celebrations of 13.3.12 were broken up by  the  authorities,  are
    far less relevant and in fact are not material to the  outcome  of  the
    appeal; in other words, given the judge's  other  findings  the  appeal
    would still have been dismissed. In the circumstances,  if  any  errors
    are disclosed, which I doubt, they are not material.

Conclusions:

31. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
