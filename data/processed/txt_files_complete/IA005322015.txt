                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For ease of reference, I shall refer to the parties as they were before
    the First-tier Tribunal. The Secretary of State is the Respondent,  and
    Ms Onwochei is once more the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge G Clarke (the judge), promulgated on 7 August  2015,  in
    which he allowed the Appellant's appeal  on  Article  8  grounds.  That
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was against the Respondent's decision
    of 5 December 2014 to remove the Appellant from the United  Kingdom  by
    way of directions under section 10 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    1999.

 3. The Appellant is a Nigerian citizen who has been in this country  since
    2008. Although she arrived with leave, the majority of  her  time  here
    since has been spent as an overstayer. Her  claim  was  based  squarely
    upon her fairly long-term relationship with  Mr  O'Connell,  a  British
    citizen.

The judge's decision

 4. In a well-structured decision the judge sets out the evidence  and  the
    respective arguments of the  parties.  In  considering  the  Article  8
    within the framework of the Immigration Rules,  the  judge  finds  that
    because of an accepted outstanding NHS debt of �5,951.36, the Appellant
    was precluded from succeeding under Appendix FM to and paragraph 276ADE
    of the Rules (by  virtue  of  section  S-LTR.2.3  of  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(i)).

 5. The judge goes onto consider the claim outside of the Rules. She  finds
    that the Appellant has family members in this country and Nigeria.  She
    finds that the Appellant was in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
    with Mr O'Connell and that they had cohabited for  some  years.  Family
    life  is  found  to  exist,  as   it   private   life.   In   assessing
    proportionality,  the  various  factors  in   section   117B   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  are  considered.  It  is
    concluded that, despite some points tending the other way, it would  by
    unreasonable for Mr O'Connell to move to Nigeria, given his ties in the
    United Kingdom (in particular his continued employment at  the  age  of
    seventy-six).

 6. For the purposes of the appeal before me the final passage in paragraph
    64 of the decision is relevant:

         "The Respondent states that the Appellant  could  make  an  out  of
         country application for entry clearance but given the existence  of
         the NHS debt it is unlikely that such an application would succeed.
         I also remind myself of the provisions of Chikwamba v Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40 and particularly their
         Lordship's comment, "Better surely that in most cases the Article 8
         claim be decided once and for all at the initial stage.  If  it  is
         well-founded, leave  should  be  granted.  If  not,  it  should  be
         refused." In all the circumstances, I find that it is  unreasonable
         to expect Mr O'Connell to relocate to Nigeria."

 7. The judge goes on to conclude that in his view the Appellant's case was
    "exceptional", and could be distinguished from that of Mrs Agyarko (see
    R (on the application of Agyarko and Others) [2015] EWCA Civ  440).  In
    so dong, reliance is placed on the findings made in paragraph 63 of the
    judge's decision.

 8. As a result of the findings and conclusions  reached,  the  appeal  was
    allowed (presumably on the basis of the relationship with Mr  O'Connell
    only).

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 9. The concise grounds assert that the  judge  erred  in  considering  the
    possible outcome of an entry clearance application, and  that  he  also
    erred in his approach to Chikwamba.

10. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  M
    Hollingworth on 10 December 2015.

The hearing before me

11. Mr Whitwell commented that there  were  apparent  shortcomings  in  the
    judge's decision on matters not specifically  raised  in  the  grounds.
    However, there was no attempt to seek to amend the grounds.

12. Mr Whitwell's core submission was that  the  judge  had  erred  in  the
    manner set out in the grounds. The judge  should  not  have  taken  the
    possibility of  an  entry  clearance  application  being  refused  into
    account (relying on SB (Bangladesh) [2007] EWCA Civ 28).  The  decision
    of the Upper Tribunal in R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department) (Appendix FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary
    separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) was relied on
    before the judge, but he had failed to consider it. There had  been  no
    evidence from the Appellant to show that returning to Nigeria  to  make
    an application would entail disproportionate consequences. There is  no
    legal test of whether a "sensible reason" existed for  making  such  an
    application but in any event, there were such reasons on  the  face  of
    the evidence: the Appellant was an overstayer and had a significant NHS
    debt. I was also referred to paragraph 30(c) of Hayat [2012]  EWCA  Civ
    1054.

13. Mr Bahja relied on his detailed rule 24 response. He submitted that the
    judge had dealt with the  Chikwamba  point  properly  in  light  of  RP
    (Zimbabwe) [2008] EWCA Civ 825. The Presenting Officer had only  raised
    the issue in submissions before the judge. There was no error  in  this
    case.

Decision on error of law

14. Although in large part the judge's decision is sound, I  find  that  he
    has materially erred in respect of the entry  clearance  and  Chikwamba
    issues.

15. There is nothing wrong with the judge's findings and conclusions on the
    Appellant's relationship with  Mr  O'Connell  and  her  other  personal
    circumstances. These have not been challenged and  were  in  any  event
    clearly open  to  the  judge.  In  addition,  whilst  perhaps  a  touch
    generous, the conclusion that it would be unreasonable for Mr O'Connell
    to move to Nigeria has not been challenged either and again it was open
    to him.

16. The difficulty lies in the passage from paragraph 64 quoted earlier.  I
    am satisfied that the issue of whether an application by the  Appellant
    from abroad could be made with the support of Mr O'Connell  was  raised
    in questioning before the judge. This is clear not only from the Record
    of Proceedings but also what is stated in paragraph 55 of the  decision
    itself. I am satisfied too  that  the  matter  was  relied  on  by  the
    Presenting Officer in submissions, with specific reference to the  case
    of Chen (again having regard to the Record of Proceedings).  Therefore,
    whilst I accept that the point had not been stated in the  reasons  for
    refusal letter or at the outset of the hearing, it was properly  raised
    both in evidence and submissions. Given this and the evidence  from  Mr
    O'Connell that he would readily support an entry clearance  application
    it was incumbent upon the  judge  to  address  the  issue  in  adequate
    detail.

17. The first point of substance is that relating to the  prospects  of  an
    entry clearance application. With  reference  to  the  contents  of  Mr
    Bahja's rule 24 response, I acknowledge the obiter comments  of  Sedley
    LJ at paragraph 13 of RP (Zimbabwe). However, as I have  said  already,
    the issue of making an application from abroad  was  a  real  one,  and
    could not simply be "brushed" aside by the judge.

18. In addition, SB (Bangladesh) may not lay down an unmoveable proposition
    of law, but its ratio has never been disapproved (having been cited  in
    Chikwamba). In the present case it appears to me from a fair reading of
    paragraph 64 as though the judge  was  relying  on  the  fact  that  an
    application from abroad would probably fail as being a  factor  in  the
    Appellant's favour when assessing proportionality. In  effect,  he  was
    saying that the weaker the Appellant's case for re-entry might be  (due
    to the NHS debt), the stronger the Article 8  claim  became.  This  was
    impermissible and an error of law.

19. The  second,  and  interconnected  point,  relates  to  Chikwamba.  The
    quotation from this case by the judge does not reflect the true  effect
    of Chikwamba. There is no rule of law to the effect  that  there  is  a
    presumption  against  the  possibility  or  expectation  of  making  an
    application from abroad, or that the particular facts  of  a  case  are
    irrelevant. In my view, the judge has failed to  engage  with  a  fact-
    sensitive approach to the Chikwamba question. There is no reference  to
    factors in favour of the Appellant returning  to  Nigeria  to  make  an
    application. There is no reference to any evidence (such as there  was)
    militating against this course of action. Further, the reference at the
    end of the paragraph to the unreasonableness of Mr O'Connell emigrating
    to Nigeria is rather missing the  point  of  the  Chikwamba  principle.
    Finally, the absence of any consideration of the  Chen  case  (and  the
    references therein to Hayat) is unfortunate, and further indicates that
    the whole issue has not been adequately considered. Overall,  there  is
    another error of law here.

20. Are the errors material? In my view they are. First, the  obstacles  in
    the path of an entry clearance application should not have  been  taken
    into account. Second, on the face of the evidence there  were  arguably
    "sensible reasons" for the  Appellant  to  be  expected  to  return  to
    Nigeria and make an application from there.  Third,  the  reference  to
    exceptional factors in paragraph 65 do not relate to anything connected
    to the Chikwamba point (in terms of  difficulties  with  the  Appellant
    going to Nigeria to make an application). Further, I find it  difficult
    to understand how the judge distinguishing the Agyarko  case  from  the
    present with reference to the findings in paragraph 63 when  these  are
    all completely adverse to the Appellant.

21. For the reasons set out above, the decision of the judge is set aside.

Remaking the decision: the evidence and submissions

22. Both representatives were agreed that if I found material errors of law
    to exist I should remake the decision on the evidence before me. This I
    now do.

23. I take into account the bundles from the Respondent and  the  Appellant
    (paginated 1-144). Mr Whitwell provided me with a document setting  out
    visa processing times for the Lagos post, and I have regard to this.

24.  Both  representatives  made  submissions  at  the   hearing   on   the
    hypothetical basis that I found errors of law to exist. Mr Bahja stated
    that an entry clearance from Nigeria would probably fail because of the
    NHS debt. There was, he said, no possibility of that  debt  being  paid
    off prior to any application from abroad. The Article 8 claim should be
    dealt with in the United Kingdom.

25. Mr Whitwell submitted that there was no evidence on whether or not  the
    NHS debt could be paid off. The Appellant has family in Nigeria and was
    educated  there.  Mr  O'Connell  would  support  any  entry   clearance
    application. There were sensible reasons to require  the  Appellant  to
    return to Nigeria and make an application.

Remaking the decision: findings and conclusions

26. The judge's findings as to the Appellant's connections to Nigeria,  her
    relationship with Mr O'Connell, his  personal  circumstances,  and  the
    unreasonableness of him moving to Nigeria are preserved. On this basis,
    I find the following facts:

          a) the Appellant's mother and sister live in the  United  Kingdom
             and she has four brothers in Nigeria;

          b) she has no accommodation of her own in Nigeria;

          c) she has an NHS debt of �5,951.36;

          d) she has been an overstayer since approximately 2010;

          e) she used a false Belgian passport to obtain employment here;

          f) her relationship with Mr O'Connell is genuine and subsisting;

          g) they have been cohabiting since 2009;

          h) Mr 'Connell continues to work and earns approximately  �26,500
             per annum;

          i) the couple are both healthy;

          j) it would be unreasonable for Mr O'Connell to move  to  Nigeria
             permanently;

          k) he would support an application by the Appellant from Nigeria.

27. In addition, I accept that the visa processing times  set  out  in  the
    document provided by Mr Whitwell are accurate: 88% of application  will
    be processed within sixty days.

28. There is no actual evidence as to the ability of the couple (through Mr
    O'Connell and/or other relatives) to repay the NHS debt immediately  or
    in the near future.

29. It is common ground that due to  the  NHS  debt  the  Appellant  cannot
    satisfy the Rules as they relate to Article  8.  The  appeal  therefore
    fails on this basis.

30. I find that the Appellant has a private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom
    encompassing her  relationships  with  Mr  O'Connell,  her  mother  and
    sister. I find that she had family life with Mr O'Connell.

31. The Appellant's removal from the United  Kingdom  would  constitute  an
    interference of sufficient gravity such as to engage Article 8.

32. I turn to proportionality. Bearing in mind the factual matrix  of  this
    case, the relevant case-law already cited in my decision,  and  section
    117B of the 2002 Act, I find that it would not be disproportionate  for
    the Appellant to leave or be removed from the United  Kingdom  and,  if
    she so wished, make an entry clearance application from Nigeria. I base
    this conclusion on the following matters.

33. First, there is of course a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
    British citizen who cannot reasonably be expected to  move  to  Nigeria
    permanently. This is a factor in the Appellant's favour.

34. Second, there is no evidence from the Appellant to show this course  of
    action would have consequences of particular  gravity  for  the  couple
    (see paragraph 42 of Chen).  It  is  likely  that  a  decision  on  any
    application would be forthcoming within a fairly short timeframe.

35. Third, the Appellant has a poor immigration record,  having  overstayed
    for a significant period and engaging in illegal  employment  with  the
    use of a document to which she was not entitled. In addition, she has a
    not insignificant NHS debt, a matter that relates to the maintenance of
    the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom. These factors combine  to
    constitute  fact-sensitive  "sensible  reasons"   for   expecting   the
    Appellant to return to Nigeria. This is consistent with  the  Chikwamba
    principle.

36. Fourth, Mr O'Connell will support an application from abroad.

37. Fifth, the Appellant has family remaining  in  Nigeria  to  assist  her
    (there being no evidence to the contrary).

38. Sixth, the Appellant has failed to satisfy the Rules as they relate  to
    Article 8. That failure is certainly not on a merely 'technical'  basis
    (i.e. a lack of status only):  the  NHS  debt  goes  to  the  issue  of
    suitability as recognised in the Rules and approved by Parliament. This
    is an important factor against her.

39. Seventh, the Appellant's position  in  this  country  has  always  been
    either precarious or unlawful.

40. Eighth, the Appellant has been maintained  by  Mr  O'Connell  and  does
    speak English. However, these are in effect neutral matters.

41. Last but by no means least, the strength  of  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration is undimmed by  any  factors  in  the
    Appellant's favour.

42. The appeal therefore fails on free-standing Article 8 grounds as well.

Anonymity

43. No direction has been sought and none is appropriate.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal under the Immigration  Rules
and on human rights grounds.
