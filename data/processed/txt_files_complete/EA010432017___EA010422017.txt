Representation:
For the Appellant:     Not in attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity order.

 2. The appellants are Hungarian and Indian  nationals  respectively.   The
    first-named appellant entered the United Kingdom on July 28, 2012 as  a
    EEA national. They married on October 22,  2012  and  the  second-named
    appellant was issued with a residence card on December 13, 2013.

 3. On July 15, 2016 they  applied  for  a  document  certifying  permanent
    residence under Regulation 15 of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006. The respondent refused  their  applications  on
    January 17, 2017 on the basis they had not provided evidence  that  the
    first-named appellant had resided in accordance  with  the  Regulations
    for a continuous period of five years (Regulation 15(1)(a) of the  2006
    Regulations).

 4. The appellant lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  January  27,  2017  under
    Regulation 26 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 and Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002.

 5. Their appeals came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Manyarara
    (hereinafter called "the Judge") as a paper case on August 21, 2017.

 6. The appellants' original grounds of  appeal  made  it  clear  that  the
    applications were based on Regulations 15(1)(c) and (d) and  Regulation
    5(3) and  5(7)(b)  of  the  2006  Regulations  but  in  dismissing  the
    appellants' appeals the Judge erred by  only  considering  the  appeals
    under Regulation 15(1)(a) of the 2006 Regulations  and  by  failing  to
    consider the appeals under the aforementioned provisions.

 7. On December 11, 2017 I set aside the Judge's decision and adjourned the
    hearing for evidence of the first-named appellant's inability to work.

 8. Further evidence was served on January  18,  2018  when  the  following
    evidence was served:

      a) Letter from Salford Royal NHS Trust dated January 3, 2018.

      b) Letter from Job Centre Plus dated November 22, 2017.

      c) Evidence of payments being  made  to  first-named  appellant  dated
         October 3, 2017.

      d) Decision confirming continued  entitlement  to  Employment  Support
         Allowance dated February 1, 2016.

      e) Decision confirming entitlement to Personal Independence  Allowance
         dated November 23, 2015

      f) Decision confirming entitlement  to  Employment  Support  Allowance
         dated October 2, 2015.

 9. The two decisions dated October 2, 2015 and November 23, 2015 confirmed
    the  appellant's  entitlement  to  the  aforementioned  benefits.   The
    decision  dated  February  1,  2016  confirmed  that  the   first-named
    appellant had a "limited capability  for  work"  and  was  entitled  to
    Employment and Support Allowance payments.

10. The medical report confirmed the first-named appellant had a  diagnosis
    of relapsing and remitting  multiple  sclerosis,  depression  and  left
    Achilles tendinitis. These impacted on her ability to  work  and  as  a
    result of these problems she was unable to work in a bar, her  previous
    employment, or stand on her feet all day. She also had  been  diagnosed
    with fatigue which impacted on her ability to function.

11. The evidence indicated that her Personal Independence Payment (PIP)  is
    currently payable until September 30, 2021 and the earliest  that  this
    is reviewable is September 30, 2020.

12. In summary, the evidence pointed to the fact that since August 2015 the
    first-named appellant (and the second-named appellant) had been  unable
    to work and had been receiving sickness and mobility benefits.

13. There  was  nothing  contained  within  the  medical  report  or  other
    documents that suggested any return to work. Mr Bates accepted that the
    evidence appeared to show that since August 2015 the appellant had been
    unable to work and was entitled to the  sickness  benefits  being  paid
    until at least September 20121.

14. Regulation 5(3) of the 2006 Regulations states-

         "A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-


         (a)  he terminates his activity in the United Kingdom as a worker
         or self-employed person as a result of a permanent incapacity to
         work; and


         (b)  either-


             (i)  he resided in the United Kingdom continuously for more
             than two years prior to the termination; or


             (ii)     the incapacity is the result of an accident at work
             or an occupational disease that entitles him to a pension
             payable in full or in part by an institution in the United
             Kingdom."


15. Regulation 5(7)(b) of the 2006 Regulations states:

         "Subject to regulations 6(2), 7A(3) or 7B(3), for the  purposes  of
         this regulation ...


             (a)  periods of inactivity for reasons not of the person's own
             making;


             (b)  periods of inactivity due to illness or accident; and


             (c)   in  the  case  of  a  worker,  periods  of   involuntary
             unemployment duly recorded by the relevant employment office


         shall be treated as periods  of  activity  as  a  worker  or  self-
         employed person, as the case may be."


16. Regulations 15(1) of the 2006 Regulations states the following  persons
    shall acquire the right to reside in the United Kingdom permanently-

         "(c)     a worker or self-employed person who has ceased activity.


         (d)  the family member of a worker or self-employed person who  has
         ceased activity"


17. Regulation 15 (1) of the 2006 regulations makes it clear that a  worker
    who has ceased activity  (and  their  family  member)  is  entitled  to
    permanent residence as long as other requirements  in  the  Regulations
    are met. The first-named appellant had resided  continuously  for  more
    than two years.  The  only  real  issue  was  whether  the  first-named
    appellant's inability to work was as a result of  permanent  incapacity
    to work.

18. The  Regulations  are  silent  as  to  what  amounts  to  a  "permanent
    incapacity" to work but I am assisted to an extent by case law.

19. In FMB (EEA reg 6(2)(a) - 'temporarily unable to work')  Uganda  [2010]
    UKUT 447 (IAC) the Tribunal held that a state of affairs is 'temporary'
    if it is not permanent. Accordingly, for  the  purposes  of  Regulation
    6(2)(a) of the 2006 Regulations, a person whose inability to work as  a
    result of illness or accident is not permanent is temporarily unable to
    work. The phrase "terminates his activity in the UK as a worker" in the
    context of regulation 5(3)(a) did not require a subjective decision  by
    the worker to terminate his employment  on  the  grounds  of  permanent
    incapacity.  Although a worker's understanding  of  his  own  situation
    might be relevant to the objective decision whether  his  absence  from
    work was temporary  or  amounted  to  a  termination  as  a  result  of
    permanent incapacity, the ultimate decision was an objective one.   The
    determining factor was not the worker's statement of his intention  and
    reasons but the  objective  state  of  affairs  which  existed  at  the
    relevant times.

20. In De Brito and De Noronha v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2012] EWCA Civ 709 Court of Appeal made it clear that the question the
    Tribunal needs to consider  is  whether  based  on  all  the  available
    evidence there were realistic prospects of his being able to return  to
    work and therefore remaining engaged with the labour market.

21. The significance of the above case law is  that  if  the  appellant  is
    permanently unable to work and  has  accrued  sufficient  time  in  the
    United Kingdom to engage Regulation 15 then that  person  must  succeed
    under Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations.

22. Having considered the evidence that was  now  before  the  Tribunal  Mr
    Bates accepted that the appellants were therefore entitled to permanent
    residence.

23. In light of that acceptance and taking into account the facts  of  this
    case I agree with Mr Bates's position and in those circumstances  I  do
    allow the appellants' appeals.

    DECISION

24. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

25. I have set aside the original decision and I  remake  the  decision  by
    allowing both appeals.


Signed                              Date     26/02/2018

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I do not make a fee award because I have allowed this appeal  based  on  the
evidence that was submitted following the error of law hearing.
