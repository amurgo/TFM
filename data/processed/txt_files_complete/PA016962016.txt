Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O'Ryan, Counsel, instructed by Barnes Harrild &
Dyer
     Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I extend  the  anonymity  direction  under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

 2. The appellant is an Albanian national.  She entered the United  Kingdom
    clandestinely on April 11, 2015 and claimed asylum on August 12 2015.

 3. The respondent refused her protection claim on February 10, 2016  under
    paragraphs 336 and 339F HC 395.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  on  February  19,  2016  under
    Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Her
    appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cross  (hereinafter
    called "the Judge") on October 28, 2016 and in a  decision  promulgated
    on January 11, 2017 the Judge refused the appeal on all grounds.

 5. The appellant appealed this decision on January 23, 2017. Permission to
    appeal was granted Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hollingworth on May
    15, 2017. The respondent lodged a Rule 24 response dated July 12,  2017
    in which she opposed all grounds of appeal.

 6. The matter came before me on the above date.  The appellant was present
    and represented as set out above.

 7. Mr Bates agreed a supplemental report from Dr Thomas should be admitted
    as it addressed a material finding made by the Judge in relation to  Dr
    Thomas' competence.

 8. Mr O'Ryan adopted all the grounds,  and  with  Mr  Bates'  consent,  he
    advanced a further ground namely that the Judge  had  made  a  material
    error of fact at [15] of the decision in finding the appellant had been
    living with his parents.

 9. Mr Bates accepted the Judge made two errors but submitted they were not
    material errors in law in light of a separate finding at  [16]  in  the
    decision. The accepted errors were:

      a) The Judge had criticised  the  expert's  expertise  but  failed  to
         identify any expertise he may have had himself that enabled him  to
         make such a finding.

      b) The Judge erred by finding the appellant  lived  with  her  parents
         when clearly the statements and oral evidence made  clear  she  was
         living with her in-laws.

10. Having heard the submissions I made the following findings:

      a) The Judge made  an  adverse  finding  because  the  appellant  gave
         evidence and he made that finding based on an assumption the expert
         had said the appellant could not give evidence. This was materially
         incorrect because the expert merely stated she was  vulnerable  and
         it may be advisable she did not give evidence.

      b) The Judge attached weight  to  the  demeanour  she  displayed  when
         giving evidence. Placing weight on demeanour has been found by  the
         Tribunal to be incorrect-see MM (DRC) [2005] UKIAT 00019.

      c) The updated letter from the expert  took  issue  with  the  Judge's
         finding at [25] that the disciplines  of  clinical  psychology  and
         psychiatry are very different.  The  expert  confirms  the  Judge's
         finding was incorrect.  This was not challenged by Mr Bates.

      d) The Judge failed to attach any weight to the  expert's  finding  on
         disassociation as set out in  paragraphs  64,  76  and  77  of  the
         original  report.  This  must  be  relevant  to  an  assessment  on
         credibility.

      e) The Judge materially erred in finding the appellant lived with  her
         parents and then used this finding to undermine her credibility  on
         other matters.

11. These issues went to the heart of the credibility  assessment  and  the
    fact there was a separate adverse finding in relation to  the  passport
    had to be considered in the light of  the  Judge's  erroneously  formed
    view of the appellant.

12. For all these reasons I was satisfied there was an error in  law.  Both
    representatives  agreed  the  case  should  be   remitted   for   fresh
    credibility findings with no findings preserved.

13. In light of Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3  of  the  Practice  Statement  I
    direct the matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

    DECISION

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error  on  a  point  of  law.   I  remit  the  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection issues back to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
    fresh hearing.
