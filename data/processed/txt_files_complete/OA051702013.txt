Appellant:    Mr Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondent:       Ms V Delgado (of Counsel), instructed by Duncan Lewis
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.     This appeal has its origins in a decision of the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer of Kingston, Jamaica whereby the Respondent's  application  to
      settle in the United Kingdom was  refused.   The  Respondent's  appeal
      against this decision was allowed by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
      Secretary of State was subsequently granted  permission  to  apply  to
      this Tribunal.

   2.     Upon the hearing of this appeal,  Mr  Richards,  representing  the
      Secretary of State, applied for permission  to  withdraw  the  appeal.
      Elaborating, he  explained  that  when  the  grounds  of  appeal  were
      prepared no consideration was given to Counsel's notes of the  hearing
      or the Respondent's bundle of evidence.  Mr Richards also referred  to
      the Respondent's Rule 24 Notice.  His application was  grounded  on  a
      concession that the appeal is not sustainable.

   3. We acceded to the application.  Accordingly, the Secretary of State is
      granted permission to withdraw the appeal  under  Rule  17(2)  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
