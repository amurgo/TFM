Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Spurling, counsel (instructed by Virgo
Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the secretary of state" and  to  the
    respondent as "the claimant." The claimant is a national of Albania.

 2. On 15 November 2012 the claimant made a claim for asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights. His application was  refused  in  December
    2012 but he was granted discretionary leave to  remain  here  until  29
    January 2015 as he had been an unaccompanied minor. On 25  August  2015
    the secretary of state refused his application submitted on 28  January
    2015 for further leave to remain in the UK.

 3. In a decision promulgated on 14 January 2016, First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Coutts allowed his appeal on  asylum  and  human  rights  grounds.  The
    claimant had alleged that he was involved in an active blood  feud  and
    would be a potential target.

 4. The secretary of state did not accept that his family was  involved  in
    an active blood feud or that he would be a potential target even if the
    feud did exist. Moreover, he could relocate to another area in  Albania
    without fear of persecution, having regard to his age, state of health,
    and the education he has obtained  in  the  UK.  Further,  it  was  not
    accepted that the Albanian authorities would be unable to offer  him  a
    sufficiency of protection if he were returned to Albania [28].

 5. The  Judge  found  the  claimant's  claim  to  be  credible  [29].  The
    claimant's father had been accused in 1997 of killing Mr Arben [C].  At
    the end of 2008 the [C] family sent a man to the claimant's family home
    with a message that 'blood would only be  settled  against  blood'  and
    that a blood feud existed between the families. The claimant  was  told
    that if he were found outside the family home he would be  killed.  The
    [C] family had been in exile in Greece and having returned to  Albania,
    the sons 'thereby starting the blood feud' [20].

 6. The claimant contended that in consequence, he, his brother  and  their
    father stayed indoors and did not go out. He and  his  brother  stopped
    going to school. A  maternal  uncle  supported  them.  They  lived  off
    vegetables grown on a small area of land at the back of their home.

 7. On 21 January 2009, the claimant's father went to Skhoder to  meet  the
    [C] family to try to reconcile the blood  feud.  However,  Arben  [C]'s
    sons shot the claimant's father,  injuring  him  in  his  arm.  He  was
    hospitalised for several days. The matter was reported to  the  police,
    who arrested a member of the [C] family  for  being  in  possession  of
    illegal weapons. No action was taken against two of the other  brothers
    of the [C] family.

 8. A few days after the shooting the claimant's father was  released  from
    hospital. The family sent an elderly man to their home to confirm  that
    the blood feud was still in existence. Attempts at  reconciliation  did
    not succeed. Nothing further was heard from the police after an attempt
    was made to involve them on behalf of the family [23].

 9. Although the  claimant's  father  wanted  the  whole  family  to  leave
    Albania, he could not raise sufficient funds for the whole  family  and
    instead arranged for the claimant to leave. He left on 13 October  2012
    with the help of an agent, arriving in the UK three days  later,  after
    which he claimed asylum.

10. The Judge accepted his evidence relating  to  the  [C]  family  leaving
    Albania for Greece after Arben  [C]  was  killed.  That  explained  the
    existence of the blood feud being declared only in 2008. The assertions
    were in line with the objective evidence on Kanun feuds [30].

11. The "objective evidence"  suggested  that  internal  relocation  within
    Albania was not a realistic option in the case of  a  blood  feud.  The
    Judge found that the claimant would therefore be at risk on return.  He
    had regard to the framework  of  factors  relevant  to  the  claimant's
    circumstances as set out in the country guidance decision of EH  (Blood
    Feuds) Albania CG [2012] UKUT 00348 (IAC) [30-31].

12. The Judge assessed the factors from  that  decision,  relevant  to  his
    circumstances.  He found that the blood feud between the  [C]  and  [K]
    families would  remain  dormant  while  the  [C]  family  were  outside
    Albania. Their commitment to the blood feud  was  demonstrated  by  the
    formal declaration after the [K] family were contacted upon  the  [C]'s
    return from Greece in 2008.

13. Two attempts by the claimant's  father  to  reconcile  matters  failed,
    notwithstanding that 11 years had passed since the death of Arben  [C].
    There is no time limit for vengeance from an aggrieved  family  and  no
    male relative of the offender is too remotely related [34].

14. The Judge found it to be credible that  the  claimant  and  his  family
    would go into hiding, being unable to flee Albania.  The attack on  the
    claimant's father showed a commitment by the [C] family to  attack  the
    [K] family. His father is considered to be the main target in the blood
    feud. The claimant is a male relative in the direct line and would also
    be at risk [35].

15. The Judge found that internal relocation in Albania  would  not  be  an
    option for the claimant. In particular, the evidence showed that  there
    would be a need for the claimant to de-register from his home area  and
    re-register in the new area. Albania is a relatively small country with
    a close knit society and a wide dialect variation. He would be stranger
    in a different area of the country which would  attract  attention.  He
    relied "by analogy" upon the country guidance authority of  AM  and  BM
    (Trafficked Women) Albania CG [2010] UKUT 80 (IAC)  which  referred  to
    the difficulties faced by formerly  trafficked  women  with  regard  to
    internal relocation in Albania [36].

16. He found that there is no reason on the evidence to suppose that if the
    claimant returned  to  Albania  things  would  be  any  different.  The
    objective evidence  suggested  that  the  authorities  in  Albania  are
    ineffective at protecting the victims of blood  feuds.  He  found  that
    there would not be a sufficiency of protection if the claimant returned
    to Albania [37].

17. The claimant's profile puts him at risk of being a potential target. He
    has spent almost four years in isolation in Albania before he left  the
    country in October 2012. If he were to return and was able  to  reunite
    with his family, he would have no choice but to go into hiding again in
    order to be safe. That would be "an unduly harsh outcome" [38].

18. He had regard to s.8  of  the  2004  Act  and  took  into  account  the
    claimant's conduct  in  entering  the  UK  illegally.  However,  having
    considered this evidence "in the round" with the other evidence in  the
    case, such damage was minimal as his evidence  was  otherwise  credible
    [39].

19. On 9 February 2016, Upper Tribunal Judge Martin granted  the  secretary
    of state permission to appeal. It was arguable, as asserted,  that  the
    Judge may have erred in  assessing  the  claimant's  situation  in  the
    country guidance by not considering the reach and influence of the  [C]
    family and in failing to consider the possibility of the  whole  family
    relocating within Albania.

20. Mr Duffy relied on the grounds. He contended that the  Judge  erred  in
    considering internal relocation. He submitted that the reliance  on  AM
    and BM, supra, was not analogous in respect of the difficulties of  the
    internal  relocation.  The  ability  of  the  trafficked   woman   with
    psychological issues and risks associated with this group to internally
    relocate cannot be  compared  to  the  ability  of  this  18  year  old
    claimant.

21. He relied on [70] of EH (supra) where the Tribunal held that a  crucial
    factor  in  establishing  whether  internal  relocation   is   a   real
    possibility is the geographical and political reach  of  the  aggressor
    clan: where that clan  has  government  connections,  locally  or  more
    widely, the requirement to transfer civil registration to  a  new  area
    would appear to obviate the possibility of  "disappearing"  in  another
    part of the country, and would be likely to drive the male members of a
    victim clan to self confinement in the home  area  as  an  alternative.
    Whether internal relocation is reasonable in any particular appeal will
    always be a question of fact.

22. He submitted in reliance on the grounds seeking  permission,  that  the
    Judge did  not  address  the  [C]  clan's  ability,  'geographical  and
    political reach' to find the claimant. Registration is not a factor  in
    deciding whether the claimant can relocate as the Judge did not make  a
    finding that  the  clan  has  access  to  the  register  and  therefore
    registration is not a risk factor for the claimant.

23. He also submitted that the Judge's finding that the claimant would be a
    stranger in a different area and might attract attention,  was  flawed.
    Whilst a new face in an area might  attract  attention,  there  was  no
    evidence before the Judge that the [C] clan had the geographical  reach
    that would attract their attention and has not given reasons  why  this
    would be the case.

24. In finding that the claimant would have to relocate without his  family
    and therefore it would be hard for him, the Judge  had  not  considered
    whether the claimant's  family  could  internally  relocate  with  him,
    thereby reducing the harshness of internal relocation.

25. The Judge did not engage with the extent of the clan's  reach.  On  the
    facts, the family had  relocated  to  Greece.  A  blood  feud  was  not
    declared until 2008 when  the  two  brothers  returned  to  Albania  to
    prosecute the  feud.  There  was  no  evidence  of  their  reach.  This
    constitutes a different category  from  trafficked  women  who  may  be
    fleeing from criminal gangs  where  their  reach  is  easily  imagined.
    Without getting into the reasons, the Judge's finding  in  this  appeal
    was unfounded.

26. Mr Duffy submitted that  this  constituted  a  reasons  challenge.  The
    secretary of state does not know why they would be at risk and there is
    accordingly an error of law.

27. Mr Spurling submitted that if the decision is read as a  whole,  it  is
    not difficult to understand what the reasons are.

28. The Judge noted at [13] that he has read and considered all the  papers
    before him. He has been guided to various  passages  in  the  objective
    material. He has read those passages with special care. They were  read
    in the context of the entire document. The whole documentation  is  set
    out before him and has assisted him in arriving at his conclusions.

29. He also stated that he had regard to counsel's (Mr Spurling's) skeleton
    argument [17].

30. He heard evidence from the claimant as well as Mr Basir [K]  and  found
    the claimant's claim to be credible [29].

31. In the written submissions before the First-tier Judge it was contended
    that the size of a population was not the true measure  of  concealment
    potential. What was  of  greater  relevance  is  the  extent  to  which
    "someone sticks out" from the background.

32. The claimant's dialect and solitude are likely to identify  him  as  an
    outsider; in a clannish, tightly knit society, a young  man  living  on
    his own is likely to be a target  of  curiosity  and  suspicion  unless
    there is a very  good  explanation  for  his  circumstances.  That,  Mr
    Spurling submitted, was the context in which internal relocation had to
    be assessed; it was accordingly not a realistic option.

33. The Judge at [31] noted that in the absence of reconciliation attempts,
    the family would have to subject  themselves  to  self  isolation.  The
    objective  evidence  suggested  that  internal  relocation  was  not  a
    realistic option in this case [31].

34. The Judge set out his  reasons  as  part  of  a  consideration  of  the
    framework of factors relevant to the circumstances from EH, supra.

35. He submitted that for internal relocation to  be  an  option,  it  must
    remain effective until the feud is settled. Internal relocation may  be
    available for a few months or even years but  if  they  can  track  him
    down, the claimant would be at risk.

36. At [36] the statement by the Judge that it would be very hard  for  the
    claimant to relocate outside of his home and that he would have  to  do
    so without the support of his family if he  had  to  remain  in  hiding
    amounts to a comment, and is  not  a  part  of  the  Judge's  essential
    reasoning.

37. The Judge had regard to the evidence that there would be a need for the
    claimant to de-register from his home area and register in a new one.

38. He submitted that the reference to AM and BM, supra, was  not  for  the
    purpose of contending that the claimant would be in the  same  position
    as a  trafficked  woman.  The  relevance  of  that  submission  was  to
    highlight the  fact  that  Albania  is  a  society  where  people  were
    inquisitive and particularly keen on  "social  positioning".  Returnees
    would be questioned on where they came from [76].

39. At [165] the Tribunal in AM and BM accepted evidence that Albania is  a
    country with a small population, about 3.5 million, and that  it  is  a
    society where there would be an attempt by those with whom the  victims
    came into contact, either officially, starting with the border  police,
    or when they attempted to find work or merely acquaintances  with  whom
    they would  meet,  to  place  them  within  their  family  context  and
    endeavour to find mutual acquaintances.

40. At [186] the Tribunal repeated and emphasised that Albania is a country
    with a relatively small population. Expert evidence referred to  common
    socio-cultural conduct in which every person was  socially  positioned.
    Family relations are strong in Albania. It  is  not  possible  to  live
    somewhere without being known. The Tribunal had regard to the  evidence
    before it in that case, that as soon as someone says their surname, "we
    know - the police scan the population. Once the name is  mentioned,  it
    depends on the family, but they come here from anywhere they can."

41. Mr Spurling submitted that where, as in AM and BM, the  aggressor  clan
    would be motivated to do so, there is a real fear that they may well be
    able to trace the claimant. At the very least, internal  relocation  is
    problematic for the claimant.

42. Moreover, although the Tribunal referred to the past and likely  future
    attitude of the police and other authorities towards blood  feuds,  the
    Judge  also  took  into  consideration  the  claimant's  first  witness
    statement, at paragraph 14 of which he expressed his fear  of  the  [C]
    family. He cannot live a normal life anywhere in Albania as they  could
    find him. That family is powerful and knows people everywhere  so  they
    could find him easily. The family is rich and have  various  businesses
    and plenty of money to spend to find him in Albania.  He  will  not  be
    able to live a normal life there without fear.

43. Mr Spurling accordingly submitted that the Judge took into account that
    the [C] family may well be  able  to  track  him  down  via  the  civil
    registration system. He referred to the Albania  OGN  of  October  2014
    which noted at 2.3.7 that internal migrants must transfer  their  civil
    registration to their new community of residence to receive  government
    services and must prove they are  legally  domiciled  through  property
    ownership, property rental agreement or utility bills.

44. At [70] of EH, the Tribunal  was  considering  the  issue  of  internal
    relocation.  A  crucial  factor  in   establishing   whether   internal
    relocation is a real possibility  is  the  geographical  and  political
    reach  of  the  aggressor  clan.  Where  that   clan   has   government
    connections, locally or more widely, the requirement to transfer  civil
    registration to a new area would appear to obviate the  possibility  of
    "disappearing" in another part of the country, and would be  likely  to
    drive the male members of a victim clan to self-confinement in the home
    area as an alternative.

45. Whether internal relocation is  reasonable  in  any  particular  appeal
    would always be a question of fact. The Tribunal in EH emphasised  that
    whether feud continues and what the attitude of the aggressor  clan  to
    its pursuit may be, are questions of  fact  to  be  determined  by  the
    Tribunal.

46. Mr Spurling submitted that the use of the word "may"  in  the  guidance
    set out at [74] is significant. It is provided that internal relocation
    to an area of  Albania  less  dependent  on  the  Kanun  "may  provide"
    sufficient protection, depending on the reach, influence and commitment
    to prosecution of the feud by the aggressor clan. He submitted that  it
    is accordingly an 'issue at large' and the Tribunal accepts that it may
    not be possible to internally relocate.

47. He submitted that the Judge properly took into account the events since
    the end of 2008 and the return of the members of the  [C]  family  from
    exile in Greece. These were the sons of  Mr  Arben  [C]  who  had  been
    killed. The claimant's father had been accused by the [C]  family.  The
    Judge had  regard  to  the  attempts  in  January  2009  to  attempt  a
    reconciliation. That however resulted in the  claimant's  father  being
    shot in the right arm and his  hospitalisation  for  several  days.  No
    action was taken by the police, who arrested a member of the [C] family
    (not the two brothers who returned from Greece identified at [20] but a
    member of the family known as "Cel" for being in possession of  illegal
    weapons. No action was taken by the police against the brothers.

48. The Judge also took into account that the claimant  spent  almost  four
    years in self isolation in Albania before leaving in October 2012.

49. Mr Spurling submitted that one of the factors  that  did  not  put  the
    claimant at risk during that period was his age. One of the features in
    the blood feud is that children are  not  targeted.  Once  they  become
    adults they then become eligible targets.

50. The claimant was 15 when he came to the UK. Accordingly, if returned as
    an adult he would have to go  into  hiding  after  reuniting  with  his
    family. He would have no other choice.  Mr  Spurling  referred  to  the
    country guidance case in TD and AD where the Tribunal had regard at [93-
    94] to the consistent evidence of corruption in Albanian society.  Such
    corruption is hidden and not susceptible to audit. Corruption remains a
    serious problem, not least in the minds  of  the  Albanian  public  who
    after many decades of living with bribery as a way of life may find  it
    difficult to see any change.

51. That fear, even if subjective, irrespective of an  individual  officer,
    can impact upon personal decisions about whether to enter the  national
    referral  mechanism.  This  is  a  framework  for  the  identification,
    referral and assistance of victims of trafficking returning to Albania.
    They will be considered for referral.  The  returnee  will  be  met  on
    arrival and interviewed  by  police  and  social  workers  and  offered
    various forms of assistance.

52. The Tribunal recognised that the NRM is in general an  Horvath-standard
    sufficiency of protection, but it will not be effective in every  case.
    When considering whether or not there is a  sufficiency  of  protection
    for a victim of  trafficking,  her  particular  circumstances  must  be
    considered.

53. Mr Spurling submitted that the Tribunal in EH recognised the  potential
    lack of effectiveness  of  internal  relocation,  where  the  clan  has
    government  connections,  locally  or  more  widely.  Accordingly,  the
    requirement to transfer civil registration to a new area  would  appear
    to obviate the possibility of "disappearing" in  another  part  of  the
    country and would be likely to drive the male members of a victim  clan
    to self-confinement in the home area as  an  alternative.  Accordingly,
    having regard to the endemic corruption in Albania, the possibility  of
    access to the register makes it more difficult to relocate internally.

54.  Mr  Spurling  submitted  that  the  motivational  factors   are   very
    significant in this case. Given that  the  clan  came  from  abroad  to
    continue the feud is a highly  significant  factor  to  be  taken  into
    account together with other factors relating to the potential political
    connection and corruption enabling the claimant to be identified.

55. In the circumstances, Mr Spurling submitted that there is sufficient in
    the determination of the Judge justifying the outcome. There is nothing
    perverse or irrational in his decision.

56. In reply, Mr Duffy submitted that if the Judge had put in place what Mr
    Spurling had argued, the decision could be sustainable. However, he had
    not. The secretary of state is entitled to know  the  reasons  why  she
    lost. If you have to go through the  evidence  and  the  documentation,
    this is not good enough.

    Assessment

57. There is considerable force in Mr Duffy's submission that the Judge has
    not given demonstrably adequate reasons regarding the clan's ability to
    find the claimant, or why the claimant, as a stranger  in  a  different
    area, would attract attention. It is accordingly contended  that  there
    was no proper basis for finding that  the  clan  had  the  geographical
    reach such that the claimant's presence would attract their attention.

58. As submitted by Mr Duffy, the Judge did not set out in  any  systematic
    manner the basis upon which  his  ultimate  finding  was  made.  It  is
    correct that the losing party should be able to  fully  understand  why
    she lost.

59. On the other hand, I have had regard to Mr Spurling's  submissions.  He
    represented the claimant at the hearing.  He  produced  a  lengthy  and
    detailed skeleton argument setting out the country guidance decision in
    EH, supra.

60. The Judge stated that he had had  regard  to  the  documentation  as  a
    whole, including "objective  material".  He  also  had  regard  to  the
    closing submissions  of  the  parties  and  stated  that  he  had  also
    considered Mr Spurling's skeleton argument.

61. It is not  contended  that  the  Judge  wrongly  found  the  claimant's
    evidence to be credible.

62. I have considered the reasons for refusal dated 21 December 2012, where
    the secretary of state did not accept that the [C]  family  would  wait
    until 2008, some 11 years later, before declaring the blood feud.  That
    cast doubt over his claim to have been in a blood feud with that family
    in Albania (detailed reasons for refusal, Annex A, paragraph 8).

63. In his application for leave to remain dated 28 January 2015, which the
    secretary of state refused, she had regard to  his  claim  of  fear  of
    returning to Albania as a member of a particular social group, namely a
    family involved in a blood feud, and whether his  removal  there  would
    breach his human rights under Articles 2 and  3  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention - paragraph 12.

64. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the secretary of state did  not  accept
    that his family is involved in an active blood feud, or that  he  would
    be a potential target if such a feud exists [27]. He would be  able  to
    relocate without fear of persecution [28].

65. The finding by the Judge that the [C] family left Albania for Greece in
    1997 after Arben [C]'s death, explains  why  the  blood  feud  was  not
    declared until 2008 by his sons on their return to Albania to prosecute
    the feud [30].

66. The secretary of state has not  sought  to  appeal  that  finding.  The
    contention  on  appeal  is  that  the  Judge  erred  in  assessing  the
    claimant's situation against EH,  by  not  considering  the  reach  and
    influence of the [C] family and in failing to consider the  possibility
    of the whole family relocating within Albania.

67. I have set out in some detail the Judge's conclusions relating  to  the
    Refugee Convention from [29-41]. The  Judge  had  full  regard  to  the
    country guidance set out in EH, supra. He found  in  the  circumstances
    that the blood feud between the families would lie dormant when the [C]
    family was outside Albania. Their commitment to the  feud  was  however
    demonstrated by their contacting the [K] family upon their return  from
    Greece in 2008 with a formal declaration [33].

68. For the 11 years that passed since the death of Arben [C],  the  family
    had refused two attempts by the claimant's father to reconcile. He  was
    in consequence shot in the arm. The Judge had regard to the  background
    evidence that  there  is  no  time  limit  for  vengeance.  Nor  is  it
    considered that any male relative  of  the  offender  is  too  remotely
    related. He found that it is credible that the claimant and his  family
    would go into hiding,  which  is  considered  to  be  a  form  of  self
    administered vengeance, demonstrating that the  blood  feud  is  active
    [34].

69. The Judge also found from the fact that the claimant's father was  shot
    that there was a commitment by the [C] family to attack the [K] family.
    The claimant is a male relative in the direct line, who the Judge found
    would also remain at risk. As noted by Mr Spurling, the fact  that  the
    claimant had been a child prior to his entry into the UK would not have
    rendered him at risk. However, he would be returning as  an  adult  and
    would potentially constitute a target for the [C] family.

70. The Judge had proper regard to the evidence as to the difficulties that
    the claimant would face if he were to relocate outside  his  home  area
    without the support of his family. He would need  to  de-register  from
    his home area and re-register in a new one. He also had  proper  regard
    to the fact that Albania is a small country with a close knit  society.
    He referred [36], "by analogy" to the country guidance of  AM  and  BM.
    Although that country guidance decision dealt with  difficulties  faced
    by formerly trafficked women with internal relocation in  Albania,  its
    use was to show that there  is  a  real  fear  that  a  well  motivated
    aggressor clan might well be able to trace the  claimant,  particularly
    when regard is had to the need for him to re-register and the real fear
    that the Albanian authorities would be bribed to  provide  evidence  of
    his location.

71. The Judge noted that an attempt made by the [K] family to  involve  the
    police did not produce any  investigation.  In  the  circumstances,  he
    properly considered the likely future attitude of the police and  other
    authorities towards the feud and the protection of the claimant and his
    family who claimed to be at risk in the future.

72. He also considered the profile of the claimant as a potential target of
    the feud and whether he has been or other members of  his  family  have
    been, or are currently, in self confinement within Albania. In  finding
    that the claimant's profile put him at risk as a potential target,  the
    Judge had regard to the recent attacks within that  feud  made  against
    his family. Moreover, the claimant spent almost four years in isolation
    in Albania before he left there in October 2012. He found  that  if  he
    were to return and was able to reunite with his family, he  would  have
    no choice but to go into hiding again in order  to  be  safe.  That  in
    itself would be an unduly harsh outcome.

73. The Judge found from the background evidence that  the  authorities  in
    Albania are ineffective at  protecting  the  victims  of  blood  feuds.
    Accordingly, there was a proper basis for the finding that there is  no
    sufficiency of state protection for the claimant in Albania [37].

74. Although the Judge did not explicitly consider whether  the  claimant's
    family  could  internally  relocate  with  him,  thereby  reducing  the
    harshness of internal relocation it is evident from his  findings  that
    such relocation might be possible for a short period of time.  However,
    the claimant has a different dialect. He would still be  likely  to  be
    identified as an outsider. He and his family would be likely targets of
    curiosity and suspicion, as contended by Mr Spurling. Further, the same
    problems relating to re-registration and the real  possibility  of  the
    claimant's identification by the motivated aggressor clan  would  still
    remain.

75. I  accordingly  find  that  having  considered  the  evidence  and  the
    submissions in the  round  the  Judge  has  made  sustainable  findings
    available to him in the circumstances.  There is no suggestion that the
    findings are in any way irrational or perverse.
