                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For ease of  comprehension,  the  parties  are  referred  to  by  their
    appellate status and positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lester  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's refusal to grant entry clearance as  a
    close family visitor under paragraph 41,  with  specific  reference  to
    grounds set out within section 84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002, namely  that  the  decision  is  unlawful  against
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

 3.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision   allowing   the
    Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision on 3 July 2015.

 4.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  and  was   granted
    permission to  appeal  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  on  all
    grounds. The grounds upon which permission to appeal was granted may be
    summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that the judge erred  in  not  finding  elements  of
         dependency involving more than normal emotional ties, and

     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred in making  a  reasoned  finding
         that family life exists.

 5. It is of note that the Respondent chose not to be  represented  at  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  but  was  represented  at  the
    hearing before me. It is also of note that the Respondent did not  seek
    to challenge that family life was  engaged  in  the  Refusal  of  Entry
    Clearance that gave rise to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

    No Error of Law

 6. I do not find that there was an error of law in the decision such  that
    it should be set aside. My reasons for so finding follow shortly.

 7. As noted above, the Respondent never sought  to  take  issue  with  the
    engagement of family life in her refusal. Neither could she have raised
    this point on appeal as a new basis of refusal as she chose not  to  be
    represented at the hearing. In that context, it would be understandable
    that a judge in assessing Article 8 might not dwell on  the  relatively
    low threshold of engagement between an adult child  and  parent,  where
    the latter proposes to visit the former. It is important for parties to
    recall that the context in which such appeals will arise will  only  be
    between close  relatives  and  whilst  a  fact  sensitive  approach  is
    sensible, where no issue is taken with family life existing between the
    parties - in what will be a long-distance format given  they  will  not
    reside in the same country - it is  difficult  to  see  how  the  judge
    possibly erred in her consideration.

 8. The suggestion that more than normal  emotional  ties  is  required  to
    engage family life is a reference to the  now  antiquated  decision  of
    Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]  EWCA  Civ
    31, which has been  overtaken  by  the  Upper  Tribunal's  approach  in
    Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) Nepal  [2012]  UKUT  160
    (IAC) (upheld itself by the Court of Appeal in Gurung & Ors, R (on  the
    application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 8), which requires a fact sensitive approach  anyhow.  For  my
    part, the fact of close relationship and the intention to  visit  one's
    close relatives with the cooperation  of  the  sponsoring  relative  is
    sufficient to engage Article 8 in such scenarios where the  parties  do
    not live together or  in  the  same  country.  The  mutually  supported
    application in of  itself  is  also  indicative  that  family  life  is
    engaged, albeit in what will be a limited form. In my view, the  Courts
    in referring to more than normal emotional ties, in  the  distant  past
    and in recent decisions, seemingly owing to force of habit rather  than
    ratio, do not necessarily apply to scenarios such as the  present  when
    considering family life between visitors and their close relatives. The
    relatives will be close ones by virtue of statute and consequently, the
    restriction of grounds of appeal to Article 8 alone can only mean  that
    the reduction of  family  visitors  to  a  close  family  category  are
    implicitly linked.

 9. Notwithstanding the above, I also  remind  myself  that  the  Court  of
    Appeal confirmed in Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  HK
    (Turkey) [2010] EWCA Civ 583 at [16] that "Normal emotional  ties  will
    exist between an adult child and his parent or  other  members  of  his
    family regardless of proximity and where they live". This  comment  was
    made in direct response to the Respondent's reliance upon the ratio  in
    Kugathas that for family life to be engaged "more" than normal ties was
    required.

10. Notwithstanding the  above,  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  itself
    confirms that the sponsoring parent will pay for the cost of the visit,
    that the Appellant has family in the UK.  Consequently,  the  financial
    cost of the trip shows a limited form of dependency by the visitor upon
    the sponsor anyhow to further  strengthen  the  spirit  underlying  the
    family visit.

11. Ms Record also highlighted that the judge was provided with evidence of
    financial dependency in the form of the Appellant's  sponsoring  mother
    supporting  the  Appellant  throughout  her  education,  including  her
    studies at Ajayi Crowther University (see �4 of the determination), and
    in the Appellant's witness statement she confirmed that her mother sent
    money for her financial support, and that money transfer receipts  went
    back as far as 2010. I am told that the receipts were before the  entry
    clearance officer and  also  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  was
    further told that the Appellant had demonstrated  emotional  dependency
    upon her mother in her witness statement where she confirmed  that  she
    had not seen her mother since 2004 and that wanted  to  see  her  again
    (see �4 again).

12. Ms Record also submitted that should family life not be shared  between
    the Appellant and her mother, their nexus could also  be  viewed  as  a
    form of extended private life thereby engaging Article 8 ECHR. I accept
    that submission as  a  viable  alternate  form  of  engagement  of  the
    convention, which also serves to demonstrate the immateriality  of  the
    Respondent's appeal. However, the two forms of Article 8  life  are  so
    closely linked, it seems unwise to attempt to distinguish between  them
    in such scenarios.

13. Consequently, given my findings above, the grounds  do  not  reveal  an
    error of law such that the decision should be set aside.

    Decision

14. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is affirmed.
