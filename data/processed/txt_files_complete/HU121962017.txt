                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State. We shall however refer to
    the parties as they appeared before the FTT.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica. His date  of  birth  is  3  June
    1983. He came to this country as a boy in or before 1996.  He  has  had
    indefinite leave to remain since 1996.

 3. The respondent made a deportation order on 13 June 2017  following  the
    appellant's conviction on 19 December 2016 at Basildon Crown Court  for
    possession of crack cocaine, a class A drug, with intent to supply.  He
    was sentenced to 38 months imprisonment. In October 2016  he  had  been
    convicted of possession of cannabis and was fined ï¿½80. Before  that  he
    committed a number of offences in 2000 and 2001 for which  he  received
    non-custodial disposals.

 4. The appellant appealed the deportation order on human  rights  grounds.
    In a decision promulgated on 7 March 2019 FTTJ Cary allowed the appeal.

 5. The appellant has nine children under the age of  18  years.  He  lives
    with a partner by whom he has two children. The other children  do  not
    stay with him but the evidence was that he  had  a  close  relationship
    with them.

 6. Before the FTT the appellant relied on  paragraph  399(a)  and  section
    117D(2) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It was  not
    in dispute that the appellant had a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with his children who were resident in the UK and  British
    citizens.  The  first  issue  for  the  FTT  was  whether  or  not  the
    appellant's deportation would have unduly harsh consequences for any of
    the children. It was accepted that it would be unduly harsh  to  expect
    any of them to live in Jamaica  with  the  appellant.  Accordingly  the
    issue was whether it would be unduly harsh for them to remain in the UK
    without the appellant.

 7. At paragraphs 30 and 31 the FTTJ considers the relevant authorities  on
    the test to be applied and in particular  to  the  meaning  of  "unduly
    harsh" as analysed by the UT in MK (Sierra Leone) [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC)
    and by the Supreme Court in KO(Nigeria) 2018  UKSC  53.  There  was  no
    criticism of the FTTJ's approach.

 8. Before the FTTJ was a report from an independent social worker  Dymphna
    Pearce dated 20 September 2018. This dealt with the  likely  impact  on
    the appellant's children of his removal to Jamaica. The FTTJ  described
    the report as "a thoughtful well-reasoned analysis of  the  appellant's
    relationship with his children and the likely impact  on  them  of  his
    enforced departure". She described the  significant  contribution  that
    the  appellant  made  to  his  children's  sense  of   "emotional   and
    psychological well-being" and that there was no doubt that most of  the
    children enjoyed a close and fulfilling relationship with their father.
    They all felt extremely positively towards their father.

 9. The FTTJ highlights the particular impact on two of the children. [S1],
    who is now 17 had  started  self-harming  when  the  appellant  was  in
    prison. The report  records  that  she  has  expressed  deep  distress,
    despair and  associated  feelings  of  powerlessness  and  helplessness
    through anger. She has a diagnosis of Oppositional Deficit Disorder and
    Conduct Disorder. These emotions became  too  much  for  her  when  her
    father was imprisoned. She was unable to cope and took an overdose.  Ms
    Pearce was of the opinion that that if the appellant was deported there
    was a very serious risk that [S1] might turn to self-harming again. She
    highlights that at least when her father was  in  prison  there  was  a
    release date. If  he  was  deported  there  would  be  no  grounds  for
    reassurance that she would be with him any time soon. [S1]  would  have
    no one to turn whom she trusts.

10. The FTTJ also made reference to [S1]'s  younger  sister  [S2]  who  had
    experienced problems during her father's  incarceration  and  had  been
    offered counselling. So far as the other children  were  concerned  the
    report dealt at length with the interaction of  each  of  the  children
    with their father and in particular  his  imprisonment  and  subsequent
    release. The  appellant's  mother  was  recorded  as  saying  that  the
    children "were fretting but they are now  so  relieved,  so  happy.  He
    gives them love and support, every one of them and their mothers are so
    pleased that he is out to help them out." All of the children who  were
    interviewed apparently spoke about their father in a positive  way  and
    benefitted from ongoing contact with him. The FTTJ concluded  that  the
    evidence supported the appellant's case.

11. In paragraph 35 the FTTJ considers that even if he is  wrong  that  the
    appellant is entitled to succeed under paragraph 399(a) and exception 2
    of section 117C(5) of the 2002  Act  decision  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances or very compelling circumstances  under  the  immigration
    rules that outweigh the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  order.
    Accordingly the appeal should be allowed under this head.

12. The respondent lodged two grounds  of  appeal.  The  first  ground  was
    directed to the making of a material error of law  in  respect  of  the
    threshold test of unduly harsh. Whatever the intention  of  the  second
    ground as Mr Melvin conceded it did not appear to deal with  the  facts
    of the present case. No argument was heard on this ground.

13. Mr Melvin submitted that the findings did not  support  the  conclusion
    that the high threshold of unduly harsh had been met. The children  had
    not lived with their father since they were young  children.  They  had
    not visited him in  prison.  The  problems  noted  in  the  report  and
    experienced by the girls appeared to stem from an abusive  relationship
    with their mother's partner. The FTTJ appeared not  to  have  read  the
    report but just adopted the conclusions. There was no specific findings
    in respect of each child upon which the appellant relied for his  claim
    that the effect upon them would be unduly harsh. There was no  analysis
    of the role that the father played in their lives. While the  FTTJ  had
    quoted authority he had played lip service to it.

14. Dr Chevlan pointed out that there was no challenge to the  social  work
    report in submissions to the FTT and there was no challenge to  any  of
    the findings of fact made by  the  FTTJ.  In  his  submission  the  key
    finding related to the self-harming by [S1]. It was  of  great  concern
    that she had been self-harming while her father  was  in  prison.  That
    stopped when he left prison but the uncontested  opinion  evidence  was
    that there was a real risk of her resuming self-harming if  her  father
    was deported. That was sufficient to satisfy the test  under  paragraph
    399(a).

Decision

15. The test of what is unduly harsh is a high one. In  KO  (Nigeria)  Lord
    Carnwath said this

         "... the  expression  "unduly  harsh"  seems  clearly  intended  to
         introduce a higher  hurdle  than  that  of  "reasonableness"  under
         section 117B(6) , taking account of  the  public  interest  in  the
         deportation [pic]of foreign criminals. Further  the  word  "unduly"
         implies an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a  "due"
         level of "harshness", that is a level which may  be  acceptable  or
         justifiable  in  the  relevant   context.   [pic]"Unduly"   implies
         something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set
         by section 117C(1), that is the public interest in the  deportation
         of foreign criminals. One is looking  for  a  degree  of  harshness
         going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced
         with the deportation of a parent."

16. It is clear that the FTTJ recognised and sought to apply that test.  He
    did not do so in a manner which we consider appropriate. We agree  with
    Mr Melvin that it will normally be expected that  the  FTTJ  will  make
    specific findings of fact in respect of each qualifying child that  the
    appellant relies on in making  his  or  her  human  rights  claim.  The
    question for us is whether or not in this  case  there  are  sufficient
    findings to support the appellant's case.

17. The lack  of  specific  findings  in  respect  of  each  child  and  an
    assessment of whether the impact on that child would be unduly harsh is
    unhelpful. Looking at the individual children other than [S1] and  [S2]
    it is clear that there will be an impact on them. There are  reasonably
    strong bonds with each of the  children.  He  is  regarded  as  a  good
    father. The children will miss his companionship and guidance and  will
    experience upset and  distress  if  he  is  deported.  That  is  to  be
    expected. While harsh it cannot be said that the effect on any of  them
    falls into the category of unduly harsh.

18. [S2] appears  to  have  been  affected  rather  more  by  her  father's
    imprisonment. She was offered counselling but it is not  clear  whether
    that was taken up or whether there was likely to be any lasting  impact
    on her of her father's deportation over and above what may normally  be
    expected.

19. The impact on [S1] is somewhat different. As noted  above  she  started
    self-harming while her father was in prison. She took an overdose.  She
    is someone who has mental health difficulties. There is a serious  risk
    that she may resume self-harming if he is deported. In our opinion  the
    FTTJ was entitled to reach the conclusion that in respect of  [S1]  the
    impact on her would be unduly harsh. It  would  go  beyond  what  would
    necessarily be involved with any child faced with the deportation of  a
    parent.

20. Mr Melvin made a number of criticisms of the report of the  independent
    social worker. For all we know there may be some merit in some  of  the
    points he made but it was for the FTTJ to  evaluate  all  the  evidence
    including the independent social work report and to reach a view on it.
    As Dr Chevlan pointed out no issue was taken with the report at the FTT
    and there was no attack on the findings of fact in the appeal.

21. Accordingly we are satisfied that there is no error of law and we shall
    dismiss the appeal.


Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
