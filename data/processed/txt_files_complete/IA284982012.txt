                          Determination and Reasons

Representation
For the appellant:           Unrepresented
For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the  hearing  on  13  June
      when I found an error of law in the determination  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge. That decision sets out the background and issues and I
      therefore reproduce it below:

      1. This appeal comes before me following the grant  of  permission  to
      appeal by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  on  7  May  2013.  The
      appellant is a citizen of India born on 27 September 1990. He  entered
      the UK as a student on 9 January 2011 and with leave until  17  August
      2012. On 29 June 2012 he applied  to  remain  as  the  spouse  of  the
      sponsor, Shirley Ann Singh (ne? Oughton), a British national  whom  he
      married on 19 January 2012. His application was refused on 27 November
      2012 under paragraph 286 of HC 395 with reference to 284 (viii) on the
      basis that he would be unable to be  maintained  without  recourse  to
      public funds.


      2. When the appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Malins  at
      Hatton  Cross  on  26  March  2013,  the  presenting  officer   raised
      additional issues  regarding  the  subsistence  of  the  marriage  and
      whether the parties intended to live together permanently  as  husband
      and wife (paragraph 284 vi). There being no objection  raised  by  the
      appellant's representative, the judge permitted the additional  issues
      to be introduced. It was clarified that this being an application made
      prior to 9 July 2012, the old rules would apply. The judge heard  oral
      evidence and concluded that although the sponsor was  sincere  in  her
      intentions, the appellant was not. She also found that the appellant's
      earnings were insufficient to maintain him and his  wife.  The  appeal
      was accordingly dismissed by way of a determination promulgated on  19
      April 2013.


      3.  The  appellant,  no  longer  represented,  sought   and   obtained
      permission to appeal and the matter then came before this Tribunal  on
      13 June.


      4. The appellant challenges the determination on the  basis  that  the
      judge dismissed his appeal because he did not fit her expectation of a
      stereotypical Sikh and that she gave inadequate reasons for  rejecting
      his marriage as genuine. It is also argued that the judge did not have
      regard to the fact that he has not had recourse to public funds and is
      partially supported by his uncle.


      5. The appellant, his wife and her son,  Luke,  attended  the  hearing
      before the Upper Tribunal. I heard from all three  and  then  from  Mr
      Tarlow and at the conclusion of the hearing I indicated that  I  would
      be setting aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal.  I  now
      give my reasons for so doing.

      Reasons and conclusions

      6. It is fair to say, and I hope the appellant and his wife  will  not
      take offence, that their relationship and marriage  is  unusual  given
      the age difference between them and their  differences  in  background
      and culture. However that in itself does not mean they do not  have  a
      genuine and subsisting marriage.


      7. The judge appears to have rejected  the  marriage  as  genuine,  at
      least from the appellant's point of view, because she did not  believe
      that a Sikh man would marry a white Western woman, a permanent smoker,
      older than him and from whom he would receive no dowry.  She  did  not
      believe that the appellant's parents would approve of the marriage and
      she found it unnatural that  the  sponsor  should  have  a  grandchild
      making the appellant a step grandfather at his age. Whilst, as I  have
      already  said,  the  partnership  between  appellant  and  sponsor  is
      unusual, it is not a reason to assume it is  a  sham.  The  judge  has
      speculated to a large extent over how a Sikh would behave and it  does
      not appear that she put  this  matter  to  the  appellant  or  to  his
      representative at the hearing so that it could be addressed. There was
      evidence before her of the sponsor having cut down drastically on  her
      smoking following her marriage but this was not considered.


      8. The  judge  questioned  the  sponsor  as  to  whether  she  watched
      Bollywood films (paragraph 8) and then drew  adverse  inferences  from
      the fact that she did not  watch  the  same  films  as  the  appellant
      (paragraph 11aii). This is a weak basis on which to  form  an  adverse
      view. The appellant has said he does not watch many films in any event
      and even if they liked different kinds of films I cannot see how  this
      means their relationship is not genuine.


      9. The judge considered that the ceremony was low key and  noted  that
      the sponsor still used her maiden name. These were additional  matters
      used against the appellant. Again, they are not matters which  detract
      from a genuine relationship. Had the judge put them to the parties she
      would have discovered that in fact the sponsor has  not  retained  her
      maiden name and has changed all her official documents  and  that  the
      wedding was simple because money is tight.


      10. The judge found that the appellant was not on the council  tenancy
      agreement and that the council had not been informed of his occupancy.
      However the evidence before her at the hearing was  that  the  council
      had been informed but that they wanted the marriage certificate (which
      is with the respondent) before the appellant can  be  included  as  an
      occupant. This evidence was disregarded.


      11. The judge noted that third party support  was  provided  from  the
      appellant's uncle but did not believe he would approve of the marriage
      either. She did not, however, consider  this  financial  support  when
      assessing the adequacy of maintenance nor is their any analysis of the
      couple's actual expenditure or of the sponsor's income.


      12. It would appear, having read the determination, that the judge was
      influenced by her personal perceptions of how a man in the appellant's
      position should behave and that her  negative  decision  stemmed  from
      that. She gave no weight to the  fact  that  the  appellant  was  here
      lawfully, that he married the sponsor  whilst  he  still  had  several
      months left on his visa and that he  did  not  rush  into  making  his
      spouse application as soon as the marriage had taken  place.  He  also
      always worked in accordance with the hours allowed under  his  student
      visa.   Although the judge made disparaging comments about there being
      nothing said about his  studies  (paragraph  3),  there  was  evidence
      before her to show the qualifications he had achieved.


      13. Indeed, the appellant submitted  a  large  amount  of  documentary
      evidence which included an offer of full time work  from  his  current
      employer,  family  photographs,  evidence  of   funds,   evidence   of
      cohabitation (showing that  the  appellant  was  registered  with  the
      council for voting at the sponsor's address) and supporting statements
      from the sponsor's daughters and son and from the  appellant's  uncle.
      None of this evidence has been factored into the judge's findings.


      14. For these reasons I find that the judge made errors  of  law  such
      that her determination is set aside.  No findings are preserved.


      15. The hearing has been adjourned to come back before me on  25  July
      2013.  All further  documentary  evidence  must  be  served  upon  the
      Tribunal and the respondent no later than 15 July.

Appeal Hearing

2.    The appeal then came before  me  as  arranged  on  25  July  2013.  In
      compliance with directions a bundle of documents has been received  by
      the Tribunal consisting of witness statements from the appellant,  his
      wife, her son,  Luke,  the  appellant's  father,  mother,  sister  and
      maternal uncle, Lloyds Bank  statements,  various  utility  bills,  an
      Oriental Bank of Commerce statement  and  evidence  of  foreign  money
      transfers. I also have on file the documents submitted in  respect  of
      the earlier hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  A  letter  from
      Southwark Council was submitted by the appellant at the hearing.

3.    The appellant and his wife attended the hearing  and  both  gave  oral
      evidence.  The appellant confirmed that the  bank  statements  in  the
      bundle related to his account. Certain transactions had been marked to
      show that he made payments to contribute  to  the  household  such  as
      payments for a sofa from DFS and the  telephone  bill.  The  statement
      from the Oriental Bank of Commerce was  in  respect  of  his  maternal
      uncle's account and showed two transfers of money to the appellant  on
      30 May and 3 December 2012 equating to �3,3000 and �7000 respectively.
      The money transfers were from his brother in Germany; he had sent  the
      appellant  �1500.  The  appellant  confirmed  that  he  was  currently
      supported by his family because he was only able to work  10  hours  a
      week and his income was �61.90 per week plus travel expenses from that
      employment. He stated however that once his status  was  resolved.  He
      had the offer, as confirmed by letter, of a full time job.

4.    In cross examination the appellant stated that he had the option of  a
      sales assistant with his current  employers.  Alternatively  he  could
      seek work as a grounds assistant at the airport as  he  had  done  the
      necessary  training.  He  also  had  qualifications   in   hospitality
      management and so could look for work  in  that  area.  The  appellant
      confirmed that he had only  recently  received  the  letter  from  the
      council. He had not been given  an  appointment  until  15  July.   He
      described his uncle as wealthy, having property, land and seven shops.
      He said he had a large family in India. The appellant  said  that  his
      wife would not want  to  live  in  India  because  she  had  children,
      grandchildren, a mother and sister here and would not  want  to  leave
      them. Additionally she did not speak the language and people were less
      broad minded there and she would not fit in. he said that  they  would
      go for holidays though and wanted to arrange a  reception  there.  The
      appellant stated that his brother was a German citizen.

5.    In response to my questions the  appellant  said  that  he  had  never
      claimed any benefits in the UK and never wanted to. He said  his  wife
      had never visited India. In fact, she had never travelled outside  the
      UK and had only obtained her passport last  year.  He  confirmed  that
      Luke still lived with them. He had been unable to attend  the  hearing
      due to a prior commitment. Mr Tarlow had no questions arising.

6.    I then heard evidence  from  Shirley  Ann  Singh  (nee  Oughton).  She
      relied on her statement. In response to  Mr  Tarlow's  questions,  she
      stated that she had three children all over 18. She did not  work  but
      had  six  years  of  experience  as  a  teaching  assistant.  She  had
      transferred a bingo winning into the  appellant's  account.  Her  sole
      income was her Job Seeker's Allowance. The tenancy was in her name and
      the rent was part paid by the council and  part  by  herself  and  the
      appellant; they also paid council tax. The witness stated that she had
      never been to India or anywhere else. She would not want  to  live  in
      India and was terrified of the thought of flying.

7.    In response to my questions, the witness stated that  her  son,  Luke,
      still lived with them. He was due to go back to college in  September.
      She had a good relationship with him and her two daughters. Both had a
      child each and one was expecting her  second.  She  stated  that  that
      daughter, Louise, was due to visit  her  later  today.  She  lived  in
      Orpington. Her other daughter was  currently  in  the  Caribbean.  The
      witness' mother was alive  and  lived  in  Orpington  and  she  had  a
      brother, sister and a stepsister. When asked how she would feel if she
      had to leave her family, she said she would not be willing to do that.
      The witness confirmed that she had not claimed any  additional  public
      funds since the appellant had been living with her. Mr Tarlow  had  no
      questions arising and that completed the oral evidence.

8.    I then  heard  submissions.  Mr  Tarlow  accepted  that  the  marriage
      between the appellant and the sponsor was genuine and  subsisting.  He
      also confirmed, as had the presenting officer  at  the  last  hearing,
      that I had to consider the pre 9 July Immigration Rules. It  was  also
      agreed that Article 8 did not arise in this case  as  no  decision  to
      remove the appellant had been made. He submitted that the issue before
      me was whether the appellant could be  maintained  without  additional
      recourse to public funds.  He  submitted  that  apart  from  the  oral
      evidence, there was nothing to  show  the  details  of  the  sponsor's
      benefits.  The issue was a narrow one  but  the  Tribunal  had  to  be
      satisfied that the appellant would be adequately maintained.

9.    In response the appellant submitted that his wife  only  received  Job
      Seekers' Allowance. He  submitted  that  evidence  of  that  had  been
      provided when he made his application to the Secretary of  State.  The
      social fund loan which is referred to in the  documents  on  file  had
      been paid off. The sponsor now received �71 per week.

10.   At the conclusion of the hearing I indicated that I would be  allowing
      the appeal. I now give my reasons for so doing.

 Findings and conclusions

11.   Mr Tarlow very fairly conceded that the marriage of the appellant  and
      sponsor was genuine and subsisting. I would say here that I would have
      found in their favour on this point had the concession not been  made.
      Despite the unusual nature of their relationship, i.e. the age gap and
      the difference in culture and ethnicity, they  plainly  have  a  solid
      marriage as is  indicated  by  the  substantial  amount  of  oral  and
      documentary evidence before me. I give great weight to the evidence of
      Luke Oughton as contained in his statements and his oral testimony  at
      the previous hearing. He has lived with his mother and  the  appellant
      since their marriage and has direct  first  hand  knowledge  of  their
      relationship. I accept his evidence when he states that he  would  not
      be backing the marriage if he had any doubts  as  to  the  appellant's
      intentions. I also found the appellant and his wife to  be  impressive
      and persuasive witnesses.

12.   The only live issue, therefore, is whether  the  appellant  meets  the
      requirements of the pre-9 July 2012 Immigration Rules with regards  to
      maintenance. I find that he does.

13.   There is  evidence  that  the  appellant  earns  �61.90  (plus  travel
      expenses) per week. His wife's evidence, which I accept, is  that  she
      receives  �71  in  job  seekers'  allowance.  She  has  not  made  any
      additional claim for public funds since the appellant  moved  in  with
      her. There is confirmation from Southwark Council that  the  appellant
      is not able to be recorded as a joint tenant with his wife because  he
      is not in receipt of benefits. There is documentary evidence  to  show
      that the appellant is financially assisted by his maternal  uncle  and
      his brother. Finally there  are  his  bank  statements  which  show  a
      healthy balance. I also take account of the fact  that  the  appellant
      has an employment offer for full time work. For all  these  reasons  I
      conclude that there has not been any  additional  recourse  to  public
      funds by his wife during the course of their marriage and there is  no
      reason to believe there will be in the future. No  other  reasons  for
      refusal are relied on by the respondent.

14.   There is no reliance on Article 8 because no removal  directions  have
      been set.


Decision

 15.  The First-tier Tribunal made errors of law. The determination  is  set
      aside.  I  remake  the  decision  and  allow  the  appeal  under   the
      Immigration Rules.
