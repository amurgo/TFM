Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Mill made
following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 18th December 2018.

Background

The appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 10th October 1996.  She
claims to have arrived in the UK in March 2017 when she claimed asylum, on
the basis of her membership of a particular social group as the target of a
blood feud initiated by an influential criminal gang in Albania who sought
revenge for her father's role in a rival criminal gang.  She said that her
aunt had been killed in 2007 and her father was murdered in 1997.

The judge said that she had taken into account all of the evidence
including an expert report from Sonia Landesmann.  She did not find the
appellant to be a credible witness.  She recounted that she had lived
openly in Albania throughout her childhood until she went to live in Italy
at the age of 14. She did not accept that there was any danger to her on
return to Albania, and on that basis dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge had
not properly weighed the evidence of the expert report, failing to note the
expert's comprehensive referencing, her use of objective sources and her
close association with Professor Littlewood, who has considerable expertise
in Albania.  Her reasons for discounting the expert's report were
irrational. Moreover she had only factored in the report only after he had
reached his conclusion.

Second, the judge had erred by finding matters to be inherently implausible
without judging them by reference to background country information.  No
regard had been had to the corroboration of the appellant's claim, namely
that the gangs she describes are referenced in Wikipedia.  Moreover, she
had not taken into account the fact that the appellant was a child at the
time of critical events in Albania and her account was assessed on her
recollection of those events.  In rejecting the appellant's story, the
judge had failed to take into account the fact that the appellant's
knowledge was second-hand and happened eleven years ago.

Permission to appeal was granted by Designated First-tier Immigration Judge
Macdonald on 25th January 2019 for the reasons set out in the grounds.

Submissions

Ms Kotak said that she wished to seek an extension of time to submit
further documents pursuant to Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, which included further documents relating to the
appellant's father.  However, she accepted that the documents would only
become relevant if an error in the decision was found.  She did, however,
seek to rely on an unreported decision of Judge Chamberlain which concerned
the same expert as that criticised by this Immigration Judge.  I did not
see the relevance of this unreported decision since it did not demonstrate
that the Tribunal regarded this expert to be reliable but was a decision in
relation to a particular case and how the judge had dealt with the
evidence.

Ms Kotak submitted that the judge was wrong not to place weight upon the
report from Ms Landesmann.  At paragraph 17 of the report she had set out
her expertise, which included working with a professor of psychiatry and
anthropology whose specialist interest was Albania.  She has a number of
professional qualifications and over many years had written many reports
including a large number on Albanian issues.  In her submission, the judge
had wrongfully rejected her report out of hand.  Moreover, the judge was
entirely mistaken to criticise the report because the expert had not
interviewed the appellant.

She argued that the judge had not approached the assessment of the
documentary evidence correctly.  For example, at paragraph 28 the judge had
said that she had reservations about all of the documentary evidence,
including a newspaper article which had been provided from her uncle in
Germany.  The judge recorded that the appellant had said that it was not
accessible online and it was only obtained by her uncle going and obtaining
it from the printing company in Albania.  There was nothing inherently
implausible about the appellant's evidence.  Similarly, the judge had
criticised the copy death certificate for the appellant's father on the
grounds that there was no indication as to the place of death nor cause of
death without knowing whether such information would normally be contained
in an Albanian death certificate. At paragraph 25 the judge had found that
it was not believable that the appellant had not been told about her
father's activities and the danger to her throughout her childhood either
in Albania or even when she was in Italy, where she lived from the age of
15, but had not taken the appellants age into account when the events which
she was recalling occurred, which was inconsistent with the Presidential
Guidance Note of April 2004.  She asked that the decision be set aside.

Mr Avery strongly defended the determination, submitting that the judge's
findings were entirely open to her and the matters raised in the grounds
simply amounted to a disagreement with the decision.

Findings and Conclusions

There is no material error of law in this decision.

The judge recorded that she had given careful consideration to all of the
evidence put forward in the case, including the expert report.  She did not
say that she attached no weight to it but limited weight, and gave logical
and coherent reasons. The experts specific experience on Albania was
limited. Moreover, Ms Landesmann introduces herself as an intercultural
psychoanalytic psychotherapist. It is quite clear that the thrust of her
expertise lies in psychotherapy and whilst her specialist subjects cover
trauma, torture, conflict, she has not visited Albania. Furthermore, the
fact that she did not meet with the appellant restricted her ability to
explore matters with her before writing her report. Finally, training with
a professor one of whose areas of specialist interest was Albania and
attending a seminar which he gave in 2000 on blood feuds there does not
mean that her conclusions in this case should necessarily be relied upon.

So far as the other documents are concerned, it is unsurprising that the
judge found it concerning that the evidence relied on in relation to the
murder of the appellant's  uncle was not an original document, was not
accessible online and had been obtained by a relative obtaining it from a
printing company in Albania.  In relation to  the death certificate, it was
plainly open to her to conclude that it was very strange that if the
appellant's father had been murdered there was no indication as to the
place of death or cause of death.

The appellant had lived openly in Albania throughout her childhood.  After
having gone to Italy she chose freely to return.    She did not seek asylum
in Italy and did not leave Italy due to any difficulties there. The judge
was entitled to rely on relevant Section 8 matters. She produced no
documentary evidence that the relatives who she said were seeking asylum in
Germany had been granted, and  was unable to provide evidence of
confirmation of their grants of refugee status.

So far as the judge's consideration of the fact that the appellant was a
child when these events took place is concerned, the judge said that her
written witness statement was vague.  Even if it is right that she could
have tempered that observation with an acknowledgement that the events took
place a long time ago when the appellant was a child this does not
undermine her overall credibility conclusions.

At paragraph 39 the judge wrote as follows:

"I apply the country guidance set out in EH.  In the event that I am wrong
and the appellant is indeed the daughter of a notorious gang of ï¿½ole/Banda
e Zani gang member and she has had other family members murdered I am not
satisfied that there is any inclination or commitment on the part of the
aggressor clan to continue to prosecute the feud.  The last killing was in
2007 and was at the hands of the rival gang group.  The appellant's family
has deserted the feud.  The appellant is not a target given her peaceable
life in Albania (albeit as a child) and that of her paternal grandmother
prior to her death.  The appellant travelled to Albania on two occasions
and did not encounter any difficulties.  On the basis of her own admission
she has received no threats of any nature whether in Albania, Italy or the
UK.  The appellant has never had any cause to seek protection in Albania or
Italy from the authorities or to seek resolution of any issues there.  The
appellant does not face any real risks which require her to be provided
with protection against."

The judge decided the appeal in the alternative, namely that even if true
the appellant would not be at risk. There is no merit in the challenge to
the judge's conclusions in respect of credibility but even if there were
the finding that she would not be at risk on return is unchallenged.



Decision

The original judge did not err in law and his decision stands.  The
appellant's appeal is dismissed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
