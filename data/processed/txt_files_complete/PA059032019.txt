                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant, a national of Afghanistan born on 14 September 2000,
        appeals with permission a decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Dunne ('the Judge') promulgated on 9 September 2019 which dismissed
        the appellant's appeal on all grounds.
     2. The Judge noted an earlier decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Adio promulgated on 23 January 2017 in which  Judge  Adio  rejected
        the appellant's claims and found he will  be  able  to  rejoin  his
        father back in Afghanistan. The Judge correctly took as a  starting
        point as per the Devaseelan principles that earlier decision.
     3. The Judge had the benefit of not only the documentary evidence  but
        also seeing and hearing oral evidence being given by the  appellant
        and his brother.
     4. Findings of fact are set  out  from  [24]  of  the  decision  under
        challenge which the Judge clearly reminds himself at  [31]  of  the
        necessity to consider whether he should depart from the findings of
        Judge Adio especially in light of the fact  that  2  ï¿½  years  have
        passed since that determination and in light of the evidence relied
        upon by the appellant in this appeal.
     5. At [38 - 39] the Judge writes:


             38.  On the basis of that evidence I find that the  appellant,
                  if returned  to  Afghanistan,  would  on  the  balance  of
                  probabilities be able to find his  family  and  return  to
                  live with them. There is no  reason  to  believe,  on  the
                  appellant's own evidence, that they would not still be  in
                  the same location in which they have lived throughout  the
                  appellant's life. If they had cause  to  move,  I  see  no
                  reason why they would be impossible to  trace.  Neighbours
                  or extended family could be expected to be  able  to  help
                  the appellant in this respect. This is  not  a  situation,
                  for example, in which the appellant and  his  family  have
                  become separated in a refugee camp outside of  their  home
                  country, where reunification might be far more difficult.


             39.  I see no basis for  the  respondent's  statement  in  the
                  refusal letter [at 45] that "it is accepted that you would
                  not have any connections on return to  Afghanistan".  That
                  statement is not in accordance with the evidence given  in
                  the appellant's first appeal, or in any material submitted
                  as part of his renewed claim. It does not accord with  the
                  appellant's own case. The appellant's  evidence,  which  I
                  accept, is that he has no current contact with his  family
                  in Afghanistan due  to  difficulties  with  communication.
                  That is a very different matter to not having  any  family
                  in Afghanistan. This statement in the  refusal  letter  is
                  not in accordance with the evidence and I  do  not  follow
                  it.


     6. In the refusal letter at [45] the decision-maker writes:


             45.  It is not accepted that  you  fled  Afghanistan  duty  or
                  imputed political opinion. While it is accepted  that  you
                  would not have any connections on return  to  Afghanistan,
                  you will be returning to your  home  with  the  option  of
                  taking up the voluntary assisted returns program to assist
                  your reintegration into Afghanistan. In addition, you will
                  be returned to Afghanistan as an 18-year-old  man.  It  is
                  not accepted  you  will  face  persecution  on  return  to
                  Afghanistan.


     7. Mr Dimnycz  submitted  that  this  represented  a  failure  by  the
        decision-maker to consider what was written earlier in the  refusal
        letter in which the decision-maker sets out relevant parts  of  the
        determination  of  Judge  Adio  including  the  finding  that   the
        appellant could rejoin his father in Afghanistan.
     8. The appellant asserts in the application for permission  to  appeal
        that Judge Dunne had departed from the respondent's refusal  letter
        and wholly ignored the danger to  the  appellant  on  returning  to
        Afghanistan alone. The grounds assert  the  finding  the  appellant
        will have family contact was contrary to the respondent's decision.
     9. This is not a case of the Judge make a finding in  relation  to  an
        issue that was not canvassed at the hearing. The Judge's Record  of
        Proceedings clearly records submission been made by Ms Kaur at  the
        hearing that the Judge was bound by [45] of the refusal letter  and
        that the appellant has no connections in Afghanistan.
    10. The Judge was required to consider all the available  evidence  and
        was entitled to depart from any  concession  made  subject  to  the
        requirements of fairness. The Judge specifically took into  account
        the evidence given by the appellant and the  fact  the  finding  at
        [45] was not in accordance with the appellant's own  case  strongly
        supports the Judges findings  that  it  was  inappropriate  on  the
        evidence to follow the statement in the refusal letter.  The  Judge
        also refers to the statement  not  being  in  accordance  with  the
        evidence given in the appellant's first appeal or in  any  material
        submitted as part of his renewed claim.
    11. It is also important to consider the specific wording  of  [45]  of
        the refusal letter. The decision-maker accepts that  the  appellant
        would not  have  any  connections  on  return  to  Afghanistan  but
        specifically finds he will be returning to his home. It appears the
        correct and proper interpretation of this is that the  respondent's
        position is that the appellant will not  have  connections  outside
        his home environment not that he will have no connections  at  all.
        The existence of  family  connection  is  in  accordance  with  the
        findings of Judge Adio.
    12. I do not find it has been established the Judge has erred in law in
        a manner material to the decision in relation to this issue.
    13. The appellant also asserts legal error in the Judge's finding  that
        he  can  return  to  Kabul  by  reference  to  the  UNHCR  evidence
        concerning the Afghan capital.
    14. In AS (safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 00118 the  Upper
        Tribunal held that having regard to the security  and  humanitarian
        situation in Kabul  as  well  as  the  difficulties  faced  by  the
        population living there (primarily the urban poor but also IDPs and
        other returnees, which are not dissimilar to the  conditions  faced
        throughout may other parts of Afghanistan); it will not, in general
        be unreasonable or unduly harsh for a single  adult  male  in  good
        health to relocate to Kabul even if he does not have  any  specific
        connections or support network in Kabul.  However,  the  particular
        circumstances of an individual applicant must be taken into account
        in the context of conditions in the place of relocation,  including
        a person's age, nature and quality of  support  network/connections
        with Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical and mental health, and their
        language, education and vocational skills when determining  whether
        a person falls within that  general  position.   A  person  with  a
        support network or specific connections in Kabul is likely to be in
        a more  advantageous  position  on  return,  which  may  counter  a
        particular vulnerability of an individual on return.
    15. The Court of Appeal has, in AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ
        873 found that  the  Upper  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  that  its
        conclusion  as  to  the  percentage  risk  of  being  a  victim  of
        indiscriminate violence was not available to it  on  the  evidence.
        The case was remitted on the basis that  the  Upper  Tribunal  need
        consider only the extent of the risk  to  returned  asylum  seekers
        from security incidents.  It  was  however,  for  the  tribunal  to
        consider in the light of  the  new  UNHCR  guidelines  on  returns,
        whether a more extensive basis for reconsideration was required.
    16. It is not sufficient for an advocate to state that error  has  been
        made as a result of the UNHCR report without more. The report  does
        not  arguably  establish  that  no  person  may  be   returned   to
        Afghanistan  which,  as  in  every  matter,  is  a  fact   specific
        assessment. The Judge examined the facts with the  required  degree
        of care and gives adequate reasons in support of  the  finding  the
        appellant can be  returned  to  Afghanistan  where  he  has  family
        available to him.  He can be returned to his family and  live  with
        them where he will be  protected.  The  appellant  originates  from
        Kapisa Province about 80 km north-east of Kabul.
    17. It is not established the Judge's findings are infected by arguable
        legal error. They are adequately reasoned  and  the  weight  to  be
        given to the evidence was a matter for the Judge. The grounds  fail
        to establish it is appropriate in all  the  circumstances  for  the
        Upper Tribunal to interfere any further in this matter.
