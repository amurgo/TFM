For the respondent:    Ms R Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of  YSR,  his  wife  AN,  and  their  two  children,
    citizens of Pakistan, against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Foudy promulgated 6.11.15, dismissing  on  all  grounds  their  appeals
    against the decisions of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  16.1.15,  to
    refuse the asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims made
    by YSR with the other appellants as his dependants, and to remove  them
    from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 26.10.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Andrew  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    27.11.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 31.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I found such error of law in  the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Foudy to be set aside and the decision in the appeal remade by
    allowing the appeals of each of the appellants.

 5. The relevant background can be summarised briefly as  follows.  Mr  YSR
    claimed to be a police officer in Gurakhan, a person of influence,  and
    a Shia Muslim, married to a Sunni Muslim. He started a religious  group
    called [ ], which made him the  target  of  Sunni  extremists.  He  and
    family members were attacked in 2004, 2010, September 2012,  and  twice
    in August 2013, the last by being shot at. He then came to the  UK  and
    claimed asylum.

 6. At �21 Judge Foudy found that Mr YSR had substantiated his  account  of
    events in Pakistan and in consequence at �26 found  his  claims  to  be
    credible and that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in his home
    area of Pakistan. However, the judge  went  on  at  �27  to  find  that
    internal relocation is available to him, stating that all the people he
    fears are in his home area and that as Pakistan is a large country  and
    as he had experienced nothing untoward in Rawlpindi, Karachi, Islamabad
    or any other large city, he could find employment there. "There  is  no
    persuasive evidence that anyone seeking to harm the appellant  has  any
    influence outside the appellant's home area therefore he and his family
    will be as safe as any ordinary Pakistani family is."  Thus  the  judge
    concluded at �32 that whilst he had a well-founded fear of persecution,
    the appellant had not satisfied the judge that he  would  face  a  real
    risk of persecution if he returned to Pakistan."  The  judge  dismissed
    his asylum, humanitarian and human rights claims.

 7. In summary, the grounds complain that the judge made errors in relation
    to  the  internal  relocation  assessment,  having  found   the   first
    appellant, on whose appeal the appeals  of  the  other  appellants  are
    dependent, to be an entirely credible witness.

 8. In granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Andrew  stated,  "Internal
    relocation was not raised in the refusal letter  and  it  would  appear
    that no submissions were made in respect of it either. Thus  the  first
    appellant gave no evidence in relation to the same. The judge  made  no
    findings  in  relation  to  internal  relocation  based  on  the  first
    appellant's profile bearing in mind the findings she had made as to his
    credibility. This I find to be an arguable error of law."

 9. Ms Mair relied on procedural unfairness in the decision of Judge Foudy,
    pointing out that it was neither raised in the reasons for refusal  nor
    by the presenting officer during the Tribunal  hearing.  She  explained
    that it was not raised because the Secretary of State  was  aware  that
    Sunni  extremist  elements  operate   throughout   Pakistan   and   the
    authorities  are  unable  or  unwilling  to  control  them   or   offer
    protection.  They  act  with  impunity  and  the  background   material
    indicates there is  strong  suspicion  that  the  authorities  in  fact
    collaborate with these extremists. It is submitted that  if  the  first
    appellant's factual claim was accepted in its entirety, there could  be
    no internal relocation. It is  further  submitted  that  if  the  judge
    considered that it was a relevant matter it should have been raised  at
    the appeal hearing and the appellants or their  representative  allowed
    to address it. Ms Mair, who represented the appellants  at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal appeal hearing, stated that she had pointed out the depth
    of reach of Sunni extremist elements  in  her  closing  submissions  to
    Judge Foudy. In the circumstances, it is  submitted  that  it  was  not
    proper for the judge to go behind the Secretary of State's case to find
    that internal relocation was available.

10. The Rule 24 response, dated 7.12.15, submitted that there is  no  error
    in relation to internal relocation; it was considered  in  context,  in
    light of the first appellant's profile and previous experiences. It  is
    submitted that it was a Robinson obvious point that internal relocation
    would be considered by the judge; if the appellants failed  to  address
    it, that was a matter for them.

11. I find that internal relocation is always a live  issue  in  an  asylum
    case as a person cannot make out an asylum claim  unless  he  can  also
    demonstrate that there is no  place  to  which  he  can  reasonably  be
    expected to go within the  country  to  which  he  would  be  returned.
    However, it is  the  usual  practice  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    separately deal with this issue in refusal decisions, and it was absent
    in this refusal decision. However, I find  that  the  decision  was  in
    error of law in that there was ample  and  clear  evidence  before  the
    judge that internal relocation was  not  a  viable  option,  which  may
    explain why it was not relied on in the refusal decision, and that  the
    decision and findings at �27 are not sustainable and amount to an error
    of law.

12. The factual summary set out by the judge at �9 of the  decision  is  in
    reality a restatement of the first appellant's witness  statement.  The
    judge accepted that he was a police officer and a person  of  influence
    who had founded a Shia group. The incidents in 2004, 2009,  2010,  were
    accepted, as  was  that  he  had  arrested  people  involved  in  Sunni
    extremism. He tried to return to Pakistan in 2012 and 2013 but  had  to
    come back to the UK because of the attacks against him  by  Sunni  men,
    including being shot at on his way home from a wedding.  Those  attacks
    were confirmed by the appellant's witness statement and a FIR  to  have
    taken place in Gujranwala (Punjab Province) 160 Km from his  home  area
    and Sialkot 170 Km from his home area. Ms Mair submitted that the judge
    failed to take  into  account  that  he  had  experienced  difficulties
    outside his home area. In fact, the cities referred to by the judge are
    much closer to home  than  where  he  was  attacked.  It  was  not  the
    appellant's case that all the people he feared were in his  home  area.
    He also waited a number of years before  returning  in  the  hope  that
    things would have died down, but they were able to locate  him  outside
    his home area.

13. In addition, the appellants' bundle contains significant  and  relevant
    evidence from A168 onwards that there  has  been  a  huge  increase  in
    sectarian violence in Pakistan, including a reported five-fold increase
    in Sunni extremist incidents against Shias, and in particular  a  large
    number of attacks in Karachi. At A173 is a report that despite the Shia
    neighbourhood being barricaded, a Sunni  suicide  bomber  was  able  to
    explode his device. The judge's attention was also drawn to A215  where
    the 2013 USCIRF  entry  for  Pakistan  states  in  summary,  "Religious
    freedom violations in Pakistan rose  to  unprecedented  levels  due  to
    chronic sectarian violence particularly targeting  Shi'I  Muslims."  In
    the same report at  A218  under  the  heading  'Attacks  against  Shi'I
    Muslims,' it is recorded that  militants  and  terrorist  organisations
    targeted  Shia  processions  and  mosques  with  impunity  during   the
    reporting period, and that the response by the Pakistani government has
    been grossly inadequate. "Whilst at  times  police  were  present  when
    attacks occurred, they were unable to stop attackers before people were
    killed." At A219 the very groups the first  appellant  claimed  in  his
    witness statement to fear, the LeJ and  TTP  are  described  as  having
    originated from Punjab Province but developed a nationwide network  and
    has proclaimed its goal of cleansing Pakistan of Shias, who it believes
    are not true Muslims. "While the Pakistan government  has  banned  them
    both, some observers conclude that the Pakistani intelligence maintains
    contact with the groups and fosters relationships."

14. Ms Mair additionally submitted that  the  judge  failed  to  take  into
    account  against  this  country  background   information   the   first
    appellant's individual circumstances  of  being  a  police  officer,  a
    person of influence, unafraid to arrest Sunni extremists and  having  a
    high role in a Shia organisation he helped found.  He  also  married  a
    Sunni Muslim, all of which brought him  to  the  adverse  attention  of
    Sunni extremists. On that profile and with the evidence of the reach of
    these organisations he must be at risk in any area or Province.

15. In the circumstances, the conclusion in �27 is contrary to the evidence
    presented to the Tribunal, fatally undermined and thus unsustainable.

16. It follows from the above that on the basis of the  judge's  acceptance
    of the first appellant's factual case in its entirety, he has made  out
    his asylum claim to the requisite lower standard. In the circumstances,
    it is not necessary to address the other claims.  The  appeals  of  the
    other appellants stand or fall with that of the first appellant.



Conclusions:

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal of  each  appellant
                    by allowing the appeals on asylum grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I consider it  appropriate  to  make  an  anonymity
order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
