Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr B Malik, Counsel, instructed by Calicess
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Obhi (the judge), promulgated on 15 June 2017, in which he
         dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision
         dated 18 February 2016 refusing to grant her an EEA  Family  Permit
         on  the  basis  that  she  failed  to  meet  the  requirements   of
         regulations 6 and 7 of the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
         Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations).


      2. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan, date of birth 23 August
         1967. On or around 22 January 2016 she made an application  for  an
         EEA Family permit based on her relationship with her son's wife, Ms
         Gita  Burkevica,  a  Latvian  national  residing  in  the  UK.   An
         application for a Family Permit was also made by Rahnaz Zazai (RZ),
         the appellant's daughter, on the basis that  she  was  an  extended
         family member  within  the  terms  of  regulation  8  of  the  2006
         Regulations.


      3. The respondent was not satisfied that Ms Burkevica was a  qualified
         person because there was said to be unsatisfactory  and  discrepant
         information in respect of her employment, which was said to be with
         a franchise of the Nisa retail business.  Nor  was  the  respondent
         satisfied that Ms Burkevica's income was above the primary earnings
         threshold of ï¿½155 per week. Neither was  the  respondent  satisfied
         that the appellant was dependent on the  EEA  national  within  the
         terms of regulation 7.


      4. RZ's application was refused on 24 February 2016 for reasons almost
         identical to those  of  the  appellant.  The  refusal  additionally
         stated that the documentation submitted did not demonstrate that RZ
         was related to the appellant as claimed. At the end of the decision
         the respondent asserted that the  application  did  not  attract  a
         right of appeal under regulation 26(3) as she failed to supply  any
         evidence that she was  related  as  claimed  to  her  EEA  national
         sponsor.


      5. Both the appellant and RZ lodged notices of appeal  to  the  First-
         tier Tribunal. In a decision dated 1 June 2016 and headed "decision
         on preliminary issue-validity", Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  D
         Birrell concluded that RZ failed to produce ID evidence as required
         by regulation 26(3) and that there was no right of  appeal  against
         that decision. The First-tier Tribunal issued the judge's  decision
         in a document headed 'Notice of Appeal where there is  no  relevant
         decision Etc.' The document read,

             "The decision against which you are seeking to appeal is not
             one against which there is an exercisable right of appeal to
             the First-tier Tribunal or is one where the notice of appeal
             falls within rule 22(2) (a) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-
             tier Tribunal) (Immigration & Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014.
             Accordingly the notice of appeal you have lodged is invalid
             and the Tribunal will take no further action in relation to
             it. "

      6. The Tribunal file created following the lodging of RZ's  Notice  of
         Appeal (reference number EA/03606/2016) had a label  placed  on  it
         that stated, 'No Valid Appeal, Do Not List'.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      7. Despite the fact that RZ had no valid appeal, and the issuance of a
         notice to that effect pursuant to rule 22  of  the  2014  Procedure
         Rules, the judge included RZ's appeal number in  her  decision  and
         referred to RZ as "the second appellant". Although wrongly stating,
         at [16], that there were two appeals before her, the judge did find
         that the respondent's decision in respect of RZ  carried  no  valid
         right of appeal. The judge stated that the appellant had a right of
         appeal as she was a family member, "whereas the 2nd appellant comes
         within Regulation 8." This however was not  the  basis  upon  which
         Judge Birrell found that RZ had no right of appeal.


      8. The judge proceeded to consider the documentary  evidence  relating
         to Ms  Burkevica's  employment  and  the  oral  evidence  from  the
         appellant's son. This included  documents  indicating  that  Afghan
         Limited, a company that previously held  the  Nisa  franchise,  had
         sold its business franchise to Devons (London) Limited.  The  judge
         was surprised that there was  nothing  from  Nisa,  the  franchisor
         business, and found it remarkable that the franchised  company  did
         not appear to have certain minimum standards such as the payment of
         wages being in line with  the  national  practice.  The  judge  was
         amazed that cash payments were being  made.  The  judge  found  the
         documentary evidence and the statement from Ms Burkevica confusing.
         The judge noted Ms Burkevica's assertion that she had been  working
         for Direct Clean Ltd since September 2016 but found it curious that
         she described her cleaning job with reference to her "previous one"
         where she  was  "doing  replenishing  and  cleaning"  as  this  was
         inconsistent with the description of her previous job in  a  letter
         dated 18 March 2016 from Devons (London) Limited. The judge was not
         satisfied that Ms Burkevica  was  exercising  treaty  rights  as  a
         worker.


      9. The judge then proceeded to consider the issue  of  dependency.  In
         light of her previous credibility concerns the judge focused on the
         fact that the appellant stated she was 'single'  and  that  if  her
         husband had been missing since 2001  the  application  form  should
         have made this clear.  The  judge  found  it  remarkable  that  the
         appellant's son was unable to  explain  the  circumstances  of  his
         disappearance despite the fact that he would have been 11 years old
         at the time. The judge then focused exclusively on  Ms  Burkevica's
         income concluded that she was simply not in a position to  maintain
         the appellant and her sister in law.

The grounds of appeal and the error of law hearing

     10. The grounds maintained that the judge's findings in relation to  Ms
         Burkevica's employment were perverse, that she  had  a  fundamental
         misunderstanding of the nature of franchised businesses,  that  she
         failed to take into account  relevant  evidence  and  made  factual
         errors amounting to errors of law. It was  further  submitted  that
         she applied to the wrong test for dependency.


     11. In granting permission the First-tier Tribunal  found  it  arguable
         that the judge made perverse findings in relation to Ms Burkevica's
         employment and that she misapprehended material  evidence.  It  was
         additionally arguable that the  judge  failed  to  properly  direct
         herself in respect of the  correct  test  for  dependency.  It  was
         further arguable that the judge erred in declining to consider RZ's
         appeal following MK [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

Discussion

     12. At the outset of the 'error of law  'hearing  Mr  Bramble  conceded
         that the judge erred in declining to consider RZ's  appeal  on  the
         basis of MK. During the course of the 'error  of  law'  hearing  Mr
         Bramble conceded that the judge materially  erred  in  law  in  her
         assessment of Ms Burkevica's employment for the reasons detailed in
         Ground one of the grounds  of  appeal.  Mr  Bramble  then  conceded
         Grounds 2 and 3, both of which relate to the judge's assessment  of
         the issue of dependency. In light of the  respondent's  concessions
         it is not necessary for me to dwell in  any  great  detail  on  the
         identified errors of law. For  reasons  that  will  however  become
         apparent I do not find that the purported concession in respect  of
         RZ's appeal can have any material bearing on the matter  before  me
         as there was simply no appealable decision before the judge capable
         of being appealed to the Upper Tribunal.


     13. I deal briefly  with  the  judge's  assessment  of  Ms  Burkevica's
         employment.  The  judge  inaccurately  cited   passages   from   Ms
         Burkevica's statement and relied on this inaccuracy in finding  her
         employment incredible. Contrary to what was said  at  [18]  of  the
         judge's decision, Ms Burkevica never claimed that Afghan UK Limited
         was owned by Nisa (Devons ltd). The letter of 18  March  2016  that
         the judge appeared to believe was  being  attributed  to  Nisa  was
         clearly not issued by the franchisor but rather by the  franchisee.
         There was no rational basis for the judge  to  find  it  surprising
         that the franchisor company had not submitted any evidence relating
         to Ms Burkevica. I accepted the assertion in the grounds  that  the
         franchisee  is  a  separate  entity  in  law   and   has   separate
         responsibilities for its own profits, losses and staff. It  is  not
         apparent that the judge considered the wage slips  relating  to  Ms
         Burkevica's  claimed  employment  with  Direct   Clean   Ltd   when
         concluding that the EU national was not working. In holding that Ms
         Burkevica's description of her cleaning job was  inconsistent  with
         that described in the letter from Devons (London) Limited dated  18
         March 2016, the judge failed  to  consider  that  the  letter  from
         Devons (London) Limited described her 'main duties' and  that  this
         was not, on its face, inconsistent with Ms Burkevica's evidence.


     14. I deal  briefly  with  the  judge's  findings  in  respect  of  the
         dependency  issue.  The  judge  only   considered   the   financial
         circumstances  of  Ms  Burkevica  when  determining   whether   the
         appellant  was   a   dependent.   However,   in   Yunying   Jia   v
         Migrationsverket, Case C-1/05 (at [43]) the CJEU indicated that the
         material support could be provided by the EEA national 'or  his  or
         her spouse'. By failing to consider the financial circumstances  of
         the appellant's son the judge misdirected herself in respect of the
         dependency test. Furthermore, the  judge  approached  the  question
         whether the appellant's husband was still alive (a point raised  by
         her for the first time at the hearing) mindful that she already had
         other credibility concerns (see [21]). Given that the judge's other
         adverse credibility findings are unsafe, there is a danger that her
         conclusion relating  to  the  appellant's  husband  was  improperly
         contaminated by her earlier credibility findings.


     15. Having conceded that the decision is  vitiated  by  material  legal
         errors, it was accepted by both  representatives  that  the  matter
         would need to be remitted for a fresh hearing.


    RZ's position


     16. Although I gave a preliminary indication at the  hearing  that  the
         judge erred in law in concluding that RZ had no valid appeal before
         her following the judgement in MK, it has become apparent on closer
         inspection of the files that the First-tier  Tribunal  declined  to
         accept jurisdiction in a preliminary decision issued under rule  22
         of the Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  &
         Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 as long ago as 1  June  2016.  Moreover,
         this preliminary decision did not rely  on  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of
         Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC).


     17. The decision  of  Judge  Birrell  was  a  preliminary  decision.  A
         decision not to accept a notice  of  appeal  under  the  First-tier
         Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  is  a  'preliminary'  decision  and  is
         therefore an 'excluded decision' for the purposes  of  sections  11
         and 13 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and cannot
         be appealed (Ved  and  another  (appealable  decisions;  permission
         applications; Basnet)  [2014]  UKUT  00150  (IAC)).  Despite  Judge
         Obhi's inclusion of RZ's reference number in her  decision,  it  is
         abundantly clear that the appeal  lodged  by  RH  did  not  advance
         beyond the "screening stage" where it is considered by a Duty Judge
         sitting in Leicester. In these circumstances, and  have  regard  to
         the decisions in JH (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 78, Abiyat  &
         Others (Rights of appeal) [2011] UKUT 00314 (IAC) and  R(Mobeen)  v
         SSHD (JR/9632/2016), I am entirely  satisfied  that  there  was  no
         appealable decision before Judge Obhi capable of being the  subject
         of a permission application to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.


     18. It has not been necessary to recall the parties to deal  with  this
         point. The law  and  the  facts  are  both  clear.  The  First-tier
         Tribunal was unarguably entitled to issue a preliminary decision on
         1 June 2016 pursuant to rule 22 holding that  there  was  no  valid
         appeal and that no further action would be taken. Judge Obhi had no
         jurisdiction to consider the jurisdictional point. As the  decision
         dated 1 June 2016 was a preliminary one there is no right of appeal
         to the Upper  Tribunal.  RZ  may  seek  to  judicially  review  the
         decision dated 1 June 2016, although she is  significantly  out  of
         time to do so.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  however  does  not  have
         jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by RZ.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision contains material legal errors.
The case is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  for  a  full  fresh
hearing, before a judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Obhi.
