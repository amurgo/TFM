                            DECISION AND REASONS


    BACKGROUND


    1. By a decision dated 21 February 2020, I found an error of law in the
       decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Rowlands  promulgated  on  29
       August 2019. I therefore set that decision aside and gave directions
       for the re-making of the decision.  My  error  of  law  decision  is
       annexed hereto for ease of reference.


    2. On 3 April 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup reviewed  the  file  in
       light of the Covid-19 pandemic and directed that the hearing to  re-
       make the decision should be listed to be held remotely via Skype for
       Business.  The hearing was held by that medium.  Other than  one  or
       two minor interruptions of connection, there were no  problems  with
       the hearing and both representatives confirmed that they  were  able
       to follow it throughout.


    3. In addition to the  representatives,  the  Appellant's  partner  and
       sponsor, Mr [O], also joined the hearing remotely.  He confirmed the
       truth of his statements dated 30 June 2019 and 15 July 2020 but  was
       not asked any questions by way of cross-examination.  I come to  the
       detail of his and the other evidence below.


    4. At [14] to  [25]  of  my  error  of  law  decision,  I  set  out  my
       conclusions as to the applicability  of  paragraph  320(11)  of  the
       Immigration Rules ("Paragraph 320(11)")  to  this  case.  I  do  not
       repeat what I there said. That provision lies at the  heart  of  the
       Respondent's  reasons  for  refusing  the  Appellant  entry  and  is
       therefore the central issue.  Although Mr Youseffian suggested  that
       I should revisit my earlier conclusions on the law I decline  to  do
       so.  I have set out at [25] of my  error  of  law  decision  what  I
       consider to be the crucial issue to be determined.


    THE RESPONDENT'S CASE


    5. The Respondent's decision reads as follows:


              "GCFR 320(11)
              I understand from your application and  Home  Office  Records
              held in the UK the following:
               . You were born in the UK and have a UK birth certificate.
               . You last entered the UK in 2005 on a visit visa valid until
                 15/04/07.
               . You subsequently overstayed and did not seek to  regularise
                 your stay until you made an application for  Further  Leave
                 to Remain on 30/03/12.  This was refused  on  06/09/12  and
                 you departed the UK on 16/06/15.
               . Whilst in the UK you successfully obtained a student  loan,
                 National Insurance number, provisional driving licence  and
                 a place at Middlesex University and Aberdeen University  as
                 evidenced by your degree certificates.  It is unclear  what
                 documents you provided to  gain  entry  to  University  and
                 obtain a National Insurance number considering you have not
                 held valid leave to do so.
               . You were cautioned on 2 criminal offences  in  2004  and  I
                 note the police report states you presented yourself  as  a
                 UK national.
              In light of all of the above I am  satisfied  that  you  have
              previously contrived in a significant way  to  frustrate  the
              intentions of the Immigration Rules be  (i)  overstaying  and
              (ii) breaching the conditions attached to your leave.   There
              were additional aggravating factors in that when arrested  in
              2004  the  police  have  recorded  your  nationality  as  UK,
              demonstrating switching nationality.  I therefore consider it
              appropriate  to  refuse  your  application  under   paragraph
              320(11) of  the  Immigration  Rules.   This  application  was
              referred to an Entry Clearance Manager prior to being refused
              and application of paragraph 320(11) was agreed."


    6. It is accepted in the Respondent's decision and now that, other than
       the suitability requirements of the Immigration Rules, which are not
       met due to the  application  of  Paragraph  320(11),  the  Appellant
       otherwise meets the Rules for entry as a partner.  The  Respondent's
       decision was confirmed by the Entry Clearance Manager.


    7. Ms Everett accepted that the issue to be resolved is  whether  there
       are "aggravating circumstances"  within  the  meaning  in  Paragraph
       320(11).  It is not disputed that the Appellant  was  an  overstayer
       when she left the UK.  It is also accepted that  the  Appellant  did
       not have the necessary visa to attend university  in  the  UK  as  a
       student.  As Ms Everett submitted, the success or otherwise  of  the
       Appellant's  appeal  depends  whether  I  accept   the   Appellant's
       explanation in relation to her stay in the  UK,  her  attendance  at
       university and her  obtaining  of  a  student  loan  and  whether  I
       conclude that her conduct is such that there are circumstances which
       aggravate her overstaying.


    8. The Appellant says that she obtained advice from a  solicitor  about
       her nationality in 2005 but  cannot  remember  the  details  of  the
       advice she was given.  That is key, says Ms Everett.  The  Appellant
       has not attended remotely to be cross-examined.  There would  be  no
       point in cross-examining Mr [O] in relation to what occurred  as  he
       can only testify as to what he was told by the Appellant.  There is,
       says Ms Everett, "no real depth" to the Appellant's assertions.  The
       Appellant does not  say  why  she  sought  out  the  advice  of  the
       solicitor.   The advice is curious.


    9. Ms Everett accepted that the Appellant was unlikely to know anything
       about nationality law but pointed out  that  in  order  to  find  in
       favour of the Appellant, I have to  accept  her  say-so  about  what
       occurred without any supporting evidence.  The advice given  to  her
       is said to be that she should wait five  years  and  would  then  be
       eligible to apply for a passport.  If  I  accept  that  this  is  so
       unlikely to be true that I cannot believe it, then  that  is  enough
       for there to be aggravating circumstances because her actions  would
       amount to deliberate conduct to evade immigration control.


   10. Ms Everett also submitted that the Appellant's entry on a visit visa
       is also critical.  It is difficult to see how she could assume  that
       she was entitled to stay in the UK given her knowledge that she  had
       needed a visa to enter.

   11. Ms Everett  accepted  that  the  burden  is  on  the  Respondent  to
       demonstrate that there were aggravating circumstances.  She accepted
       that the  Respondent  cannot  make  out  the  reason  given  in  the
       decision, namely  the  circumstances  at  the  time  of  the  police
       caution.  There is no evidence of what was there said.  However, she
       submitted that I could nonetheless  find  that  other  circumstances
       were aggravating, whether or not relied upon by  the  Respondent  at
       the time of the decision. It was implicit from what was said  in  my
       error of law  decision  that  I  accepted  that  the  attendance  at
       university and obtaining of a student loan  and  national  insurance
       number could amount to  aggravating  circumstances  whether  or  not
       those matters were relied upon expressly.

   12. Ms Everett also pointed out  that  those  matters  could  amount  to
       "switching  nationality"  as  originally  asserted  but   based   on
       different evidence.

   13. In conclusion, Ms Everett submitted that it was difficult to see how
       the obtaining of benefits to which the Appellant  was  not  entitled
       could be other than deliberate.  She submitted  that,  in  order  to
       find for the Appellant, I would have to accept that her actions were
       innocent.  I do not accept that the issue is quite as clear  cut  as
       that.  Even if deliberate, if the Appellant's actions were not  such
       as to aggravate her overstaying, then  Paragraph  320(11)  does  not
       apply.


    THE APPELLANT'S CASE


   14.  Mr Youssefian submitted a skeleton argument.  He  again  relied  on
       the case of PS (paragraph 320(11)  discretion:  care  needed)  India
       [2010] UKUT 440 (IAC) the headnote to which reads as follows:


           "In exercising discretion under paragraph 320(11) of  HC395,  as
           amended, to refuse an application for entry clearance in a  case
           where the automatic prohibition on the grant of entry  clearance
           in paragraph 320(7B) is disapplied  by  paragraph  320(7C),  the
           decision  maker  must  exercise  great  care  in  assessing  the
           aggravating circumstances said to justify refusal and must  have
           regard to the public interest in encouraging those unlawfully in
           the United Kingdom to leave and seek to regularise their  status
           by an application for entry clearance."


   15. I do not consider that this case assists me.  As is clear  from  the
       body of the decision, the Tribunal was there  dealing  with  a  case
       where there was no indication  that  aggravating  circumstances  had
       even been considered by the decision-maker, in  the  context  of  an
       error of law decision and where the appeal was allowed on the  basis
       that the Respondent's decision was "not in accordance with the  law"
       and therefore remitting the case back to the Respondent for a lawful
       decision.  That ground of appeal is no longer open to the  Appellant
       and nor can I decide to remit the case back to  the  decision-maker.
       The Appellant either succeeds on human rights grounds or  fails  and
       whether she succeeds or fails depends whether I  accept  that  there
       were or were not aggravating circumstances in this case.


   16. I do not understand it now to be disputed by the Appellant that  she
       was not  entitled  to  attend  university  in  the  UK  without  the
       requisite visa to do so nor that she was not entitled to  a  student
       loan.  She also obtained a national insurance number.  Since,  as  a
       visitor, it has long been the case that she would not be entitled to
       work, she could not have been entitled to  that  either.   The  real
       issue in relation to her evidence is whether she thought she was  so
       entitled and whether her conduct was deliberately designed to enable
       her to remain in the UK without permission.  I therefore turn to her
       evidence in this regard.


   17. The Appellant's evidence is set out in two witness  statements  from
       the Appellant dated 2 July 2019 and 13 March 2020.   There  is  also
       some limited evidence in the more recent statement of Mr  [O]  dated
       15 July 2020 although what he says necessarily depends  on  what  he
       has been told by the Appellant.


   18. The relevant parts  of  the  Appellant's  first  statement  read  as
       follows:


           "Immigration History
           1. By way of background, I was born in the  UK  on  17  December
              1985 at Guy's and St  Thomas'  Hospital,  London.   I  recall
              living in the UK until December 1989, when my mother took  me
              and my two siblings to Nigeria  so  that  we  could  join  my
              father who was already residing in that country.   Therefore,
              I spent the first four years of my life in the UK.   For  the
              reasons I will explain later on, this is important for why  I
              'overstayed' in the UK.
           2. I returned to the UK in September  2003  with  a  multi-entry
              visit visa valid for two years from 28 May 2003.  I was still
              under 18 at the time, my mother had made the visa application
              on my behalf, I returned in 2004 to see my relatives  in  the
              UK.
           3. Regrettably, my father passed way in Nigeria on  22  February
              2005.  I was struggling to cope with his passing.  I was very
              close to my paternal uncle who resided in the UK, he  was  my
              shoulder to lean on when times were tough, and so I came back
              to this country to visit him in 2005.  Whilst in  the  UK,  I
              attended a consultation with a solicitor who had  advised  me
              that I was eligible to apply for a British  citizen  passport
              because I was born in the UK.  However, he advised me that  I
              would need to wait for at least five years in order  to  make
              such an application.  I am afraid I do not recall the details
              of the solicitor but in any case, it was a one-off meeting.
           4. Therefore, in 2011, I filled in an  application  form  for  a
              British passport as much as I could and  later  went  to  the
              Citizens Advice Bureau in Aberdeen Scotland to ask for  their
              assistance.  I was informed by them that my application would
              be unsuccessful because I had overstayed.  I was  shocked  to
              hear this because of the advice I had  received,  indeed  the
              previous  solicitors  had  made  no  mention  of  overstaying
              disqualifying me from obtaining  a  passport  and  I  had  no
              reason to dispute what the lawyer had told me.  The staff  at
              Citizens Advice Bureau later advised that  I  see  assistance
              from another lawyer as the case was beyond  their  scope.   I
              attended another consultation with  a  different  lawyer  who
              advised me to make an application for leave to  remain  under
              Article 8 of the European Convention  on  Human  Rights.   In
              accordance with that  advice  I  instructed  that  lawyer  to
              prepare  and  lodge  with  the  UKVI   an   application   for
              discretionary leave which was  submitted  on  30  March  2012
              which was refused on 6 September 2012.  I was unsure of  what
              to do at that time and if the truth be told, I think  I  just
              buried my head in the sand.  It was after meeting Utchay  and
              seeing that I could not continue in this limbo that I decided
              that something would need to  be  done  and  that  is  why  I
              voluntarily returned to Nigeria on 16 June 2015.
              ...
              Refusal letter
              19.      Turning to the  reasons  provided  for  refusing  my
              appeal, I should explain how I was able to obtain a  national
              insurance number, a provisional driving  licence,  a  student
              loan and places at Middlesex and Aberdeen University.
              20.      From an early age I considered myself British  until
              I gradually understood that this was not the case.  Having  a
              UK birth certificate, National Insurance number, a UK Driving
              licence and access to student loans gave me the impression  I
              was legally in the UK.  A previous solicitor  explained  that
              all I needed was to gather my proof of long stay  in  the  UK
              and make an application for naturalisation after having  been
              in the UK for five years.  I was also  advised  to  apply  to
              register as a British Citizen but I had not been  in  the  UK
              for 10 years continuously from birth.
              21.      In order to apply for national insurance  number,  I
              made an appointment to meet with a member of staff at the Job
              Centreplus located in Aldgate, London in 2006.  As far  as  I
              can remember, I went in for the appointment with my  original
              birth certificate, provisional driving licence and  proof  of
              address.   I  was  subsequently  provided  with  a   national
              insurance number.  I had not been advised at all during  that
              process that I was not  eligible  for  a  National  Insurance
              number, if indeed, that is the case.
              22.      I obtained a student loan by going  on  the  student
              loan website, entering in the required  details.   I  had  to
              provide proof of ID, UCAS admission confirmation and proof of
              my national  insurance  number.   That  is  all  I  provided.
              Furthermore, in order to obtain places at the  aforementioned
              universities, I applied through UCAS and was offered a place.
              23.      I cannot recall precisely which documents I provided
              in order to obtain a provisional licence as it  was  so  long
              ago, but to my recollection all I had provided was  my  birth
              certificate,  passport  photograph  and  proof  of   address.
              Again, I was not informed that  I  was  not  eligible  for  a
              provisional driving licence, if indeed, that was the case.
              24.      Insofar as  it  is  suggested  that  I  had  somehow
              obtained these items  and  services  by  deception  (which  I
              refute entirely), neither myself or my legal  representatives
              have been provided with evidence to demonstrate  that  I  had
              provided false documents or information,  or  anything  which
              confirms that I was not  entitled  to  a  National  Insurance
              number, a provisional driving licence etc.
              25.      It is correct  that  I  received  two  cautions  for
              shoplifting in 2004.  Me and a  couple  of  my  friends  went
              shopping and they pressured me into taking a cardigan in  GAP
              and a bracelet in the BHS store.  This  occurred  within  the
              same hour on the same day (The shops were  connected  in  the
              same shopping centre).  I was young at the time.  I  make  no
              excuses for my behaviour but to remind the court of my  youth
              and that it was 15 years ago.  I have never been  in  trouble
              with the police since and have certainly learnt my lesson.
              26.      I do not feel that I have, to use the words  of  the
              Entry Clearance Officer 'contrived in a  significant  way  to
              frustrate the intentions of the Immigration Rules'.   When  I
              made my application to stay in the UK, I  did  so  on  advice
              from legal representatives.  Similarly, when I applied for my
              National Insurance number, Driving Licence  etc,  I  followed
              fully the guidance and information that was provided  to  me.
              If, and it is not  clearly  stated  in  the  refusal,  I  did
              anything wrong, I do so inadvertently and if that  is  so,  I
              sincerely apologise.  However, I  do  not  feel  that  it  is
              proportionate to punish me and  my  partner  by  refusing  my
              application and effectively forcing us to live separately for
              what could be an indefinite period.  I therefore respectfully
              ask the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal to not let these two
              cautions which were over 15 years ago prevent me from joining
              my fianc�e in the UK."


   19. In her  second  statement,  the  Appellant  says  this  (so  far  as
       relevant):


           "...2.      My appeal  was  dismissed  on  the  basis  that  the
           Immigration Judge considered that I had previously contrived  in
           a significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Immigration
           Rules  by  overstaying  and  using  and  obtaining  services  or
           benefits to which I was not entitled.  FTTJ Rowlands  considered
           that I had deliberately  presented  a  false  impression  of  my
           immigration status in order to gain  employment,  and  obtain  a
           national insurance number, reduced university fees and a student
           loan.  I should state, at this stage, that I  adopt  my  earlier
           statement of 2 July 2019 which  was  lodged  in  support  of  my
           appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal.   In  that  statement  I
           explained how I was able to obtain a national insurance  number,
           a student loan and a driving license, and that I did not provide
           false documents or information in order to obtain these things.
           ...
           4.    I understand from my legal representatives that UTJ  Smith
           set aside the earlier FTT decision because the Immigration Judge
           failed to consider my own evidence as  to  how  and  why  I  had
           obtained  the  aforementioned  documents  and  services  without
           deception; and that she had failed to  make  a  finding  on  the
           reasons  provided  by  the  ECO  for  considering  that  I   had
           deliberately presented a false impression of  myself  to  obtain
           the above items.  To that end, I have provided DJ Webb & Co with
           correspondence from the  Student  Loans  Company,  covering  the
           period from 21 November 2006 to 16 October 2019, to confirm that
           they required either my birth certificate or passport to process
           my claim for a student  loan,  and  that  I  have  already  made
           arrangements to repay the loan.  As stated in my earlier witness
           statement, I provided the Student Loans Company with proof of my
           identity,  which  was  my  UK  birth  certificate.    My   legal
           representatives have also emailed the Student Loans  Company  to
           request information on the eligibility criteria, and application
           and documents I would have had to provide in order to  obtain  a
           student  loan  in  2006.   Regrettably,  this  request  is   yet
           unanswered.
           5.    I reiterate that in order to obtain a driving license  all
           I had to provide  was  my  UK  birth  certificate,  my  passport
           photograph and a proof of address, and  in  order  to  obtain  a
           national insurance number I was only required to provide  my  UK
           birth certificate, provisional  driving  license  and  proof  of
           address.  I refute the suggestion  that  I  deliberately  misled
           officials on behalf of the DVLA,  the  Department  of  Work  and
           Pensions or the Student Loans Company.
           6.     Turning  to  the  topic  of  my  voluntary  departure,  I
           understand that FTTJ Rowlands considered that I  should  receive
           no credit for electing to leave this country in order to  return
           to join Utchay on the correct visa.  I also understand that  UTJ
           Smith upheld the earlier decision on  this  point.   However,  I
           still maintain that it should be recognised that I did the right
           thing, albeit belatedly.  Furthermore, if this approach were  to
           be applied in similar cases, ie those where a person was in this
           country unlawfully but leaves voluntarily only to be  refused  a
           visa to return, I would expect that this would have  the  effect
           of discouraging such persons from leaving the UK and  trying  to
           re-enter by lawful means.  I would add  that  if  I  am  granted
           entry clearance  the  question  of  any  future  breach  of  any
           immigration laws would not arise since I would have no  need  to
           breach any immigration laws - I would be in the UK lawfully - so
           that I present no risk of  breaching  immigration  laws  in  the
           future."


   20. The evidence to which the  Appellant  refers  in  her  statement  is
       contained within the supplementary bundle filed on  13  March  2020.
       In particular at page [6] of that bundle, there is a letter dated 21
       November 2006 from the LB Barking and  Dagenham  branch  of  Student
       Finance Direct (the trading name of Student Loans Company Ltd) which
       reads as follows (so far as relevant):


           "...When you applied, we asked you  to  send  us  the  following
           documents in support of your application:
           Date Of Birth: Original birth certificate, or Passport
           Place Of Birth: Original birth certificate, or Passport
           Identity: Adoption Certificate, or Original  birth  certificate,
           or Passport
           ..."

       There then follows a chasing letter  dated  7  December  2006  again
       seeking those documents and finally a letter dated 14 December  2006
       confirming entitlement.  That required  the  Appellant  to  sign  an
       online declaration form.  The letter also included  reference  to  a
       booklet providing guidance about financial support for  students  in
       higher education which could be obtained online.


   21. The attached notification confirmed that the Appellant  was  awarded
       �1200 for payment of her fees  and  �4630  by  way  of  maintenance.
       Other notifications in the bundle indicate that  the  Appellant  was
       awarded �3000 for fees and �4630 towards maintenance on 23  February
       2007, �3070 for fees and �4735 towards maintenance on 17 July  2007,
       �3145  for  fees  and  �4944  towards  maintenance,  as  well  as  a
       maintenance grant of �2835 on 10 October 2008, �3070  for  fees  and
       �5185 towards maintenance as well as a maintenance grant of �2765 on
       21 October 2008.  It is not entirely clear to me whether those  were
       all  amounts  paid  or  whether  some  notifications   are   revised
       assessments.  Either way, there is also evidence that the  Appellant
       is repaying the loan by way of an "Overseas Repayment  Schedule"  at
       the current rate of �246 per month.


   22. At page [010] of the supplementary bundle, appears  the  declaration
       form which the Appellant was asked to  sign.   That  refers  to  the
       booklet about terms and conditions of the loan.  Unfortunately, I do
       not have a copy of that booklet and there has been no response to  e
       mails from the Appellant's solicitors requesting  other  information
       about entitlement to loans at the relevant  time.   I  do  note  the
       following provisions within the form which may have some relevance:


           "..h. I agree that my request for  a  loan,  the  loan  and  the
              contract between me and the lender shall be governed  by  the
              law of the place of my home address as  supplied  during  the
              online application process (or, if my address is outside  the
              United Kingdom, English).
           i. I irrevocably agree that the courts of the part of the United
              Kingdom in which my home address supplied during  the  online
              application process  is  situated  (or  the  English,  Welsh,
              Scottish and  Northern  Irish  courts  where  my  address  is
              outside  the  United  Kingdom)   shall   have   non-exclusive
              jurisdiction to hear any action or proceedings arising out of
              or in connection with the loan and the  contract  between  me
              and my lender and I irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of
              those courts and waive any objection to the  jurisdiction  of
              those courts, provided that this shall not limit the lender's
              rights to take proceedings against me in any other  court  of
              competent jurisdiction.
           j. I agree that from the date I submit this form until the  date
              when  my  loan(s),  together  with  all  and  any   interest,
              penalties and charges which apply, is fully  repaid,  I  will
              notify the lender of any  changes  in  the  personal  details
              (including National Insurance number) and contact  details  I
              have provided as required in accordance with the  Regulations
              referred to in paragraph c.
           k. In the event that  I  leave  the  United  Kingdom  to  reside
              outside the United Kingdom or that for any other reason I  am
              outside the UK tax system, I undertake to inform  the  lender
              in accordance with the regulations referred to in paragraph c
              and I undertake to provide the lender with  my  new  and  any
              subsequent contact details until my loan, together  with  all
              and any interest, penalties and charges which apply, is fully
              repaid.
           l. ...
           n.    I understand the lender will check my  National  Insurance
              number and personal  details,  specifically,  name,  date  of
              birth and address with the Department for Work  and  Pensions
              (DWP).  If I do not know my National Insurance Number, or  if
              the number I provide cannot be authenticated, DWP will  trace
              and give my number to the lender."


   23. Finally, at page [018] of  the  supplementary  bundle,  there  is  a
       letter from the Student Loans Company  Ltd  dated  30  October  2007
       indicating that they had checked information with the Department  of
       Work and Pensions who had been  unable  to  verify  the  Appellant's
       national insurance  number.   That  the  Appellant  received  awards
       thereafter confirms  that  the  Appellant  must  have  answered  the
       enquiry in that letter to the satisfaction of the company.


   24. Finally, I come to Mr [O]'s statement of 15 July 2020 which reads as
       follows so far as relevant:


           "..2. I have been asked to clarify with my fianc�e  whether  she
           deliberately lied  to  police  officers  about  her  immigration
           status when she was arrested many years ago for shoplifting.
           3.    She reminded me that the events occurred  many  years  ago
           and so she does not have a precise recollection of the incident.
            However, she does remember being asked by  police  officers  to
           provide her full  name,  date  of  birth  and  full  residential
           address.  She informed me that at no  point  was  she  asked  to
           clarify her immigration status.  The police officers  ran  their
           own checks and thereafter arrested her.
           4.    I asked my fianc�e if after her arrest she was ever  asked
           by police officers to clarify her immigration status.  She  told
           me that she  was  never  questioned  by  the  police  about  her
           immigration status."


   25. Turning then to Mr Youssefian's  submissions,  he  asserted,  and  I
       accept (as did Ms Everett)  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  the
       Appellant told the police in 2004 that she  was  British.   Had  she
       done so, the police would have made enquiries and it is likely  that
       the Appellant's presence in the UK would have been drawn to the Home
       Office's attention.  In any event, what happened in 2004 is  largely
       irrelevant as it is the Appellant's case as I understand it that she
       returned to Nigeria when her father died in February  2005  and  re-
       entered.  Moreover,  it  is  also  her  evidence  (which  I  do  not
       understand to be disputed) that she had a multi-visit visa valid for
       two years from May  2003  and  therefore  whilst  not  British,  the
       Appellant would not have been in the UK unlawfully at  the  time  of
       the shoplifting cautions.  Thus, she could have demonstrated to  the
       police that she was here lawfully at the time  and  would  not  have
       needed to lie about her nationality.


   26. Mr Youssefian sought to draw a distinction  between  the  assertions
       made in the Respondent's decision about  switching  nationality  and
       the matters now relied on (the obtaining of the loan, study  in  the
       UK, national insurance number and driving licence).   He  said  that
       the  latter  were  breaches  of  conditions  and   not   aggravating
       circumstances and that to rely on those  was  double  counting.   He
       relied in that regard on what is said at [28] of a decision of Upper
       Tribunal Judge Conway promulgated on 2 April 2019 in Gurbhej Singh v
       Entry Clearance Officer - New Delhi (HU/07439/2017) as follows:


           "Thus, there must have been breaches which frustrated the  Rules
           in a significant  way  plus  aggravating  circumstances.   There
           should  be  no  overlap  between   a   'significant   way'   and
           'aggravating circumstances'  otherwise  there  would  be  double
           counting.  Decisions makers and Tribunals must  'exercise  great
           care' (per PS headnote) in deciding to apply  paragraph  320(11)
           to  a  family  member  and  must  ensure  that  the  aggravating
           circumstances  relied  on  are  'truly  aggravating'  (PS  [14])
           otherwise there is a risk of discouraging migrants  from  making
           applications to regularise their stay, which would  be  contrary
           to the public interest."


   27. This is an unreported decision.  Mr Youssefian told me that  he  had
       the permission of the Judge to rely on it although I cannot find any
       confirmation of that from UTJ Conway.  In any event, it is  at  most
       only persuasive.  I do not disagree with what is there  said  but  I
       consider that case can be distinguished from  the  circumstances  of
       this. In this case, if the Respondent was saying, for example,  that
       the  Appellant  had  overstayed  but  that  I  should  consider   as
       aggravating circumstances, the fact that  she  had  done  so  for  a
       significant period without seeking to regularise her stay,  I  would
       have no difficulty in rejecting that submission.  That would  amount
       to double counting.  In this case, though, leaving aside whether the
       circumstances relied upon can amount to "switching nationality", the
       overstaying  is  capable  of  being  aggravated  by  the  breach  of
       conditions or, more accurately, the obtaining of benefits  to  which
       the Appellant was not entitled.  The question  is  therefore  rather
       one of whether the Appellant knew that she was not entitled and  has
       "contrived" to avoid immigration  control  by  overstaying  and  has
       obtained the benefits to that end.


   28. In relation to whether the obtaining of the benefits  to  which  she
       was  not  entitled  was  deliberate,  Mr  Youssefian  accepted  that
       factually the Appellant was unlikely to have been entitled to  those
       benefits.  It is certainly the case that she  was  not  entitled  to
       study as there have been separate categories  of  visa  for  foreign
       students for very many years.  However, the position is not, as now,
       that colleges are required to make checks of their students  in  the
       same way.  I doubt therefore that  the  Appellant  was  required  to
       prove that she was entitled to study in the UK when she  applied  to
       her college.


   29. The position may be less clear in relation to  the  other  benefits.
       However, since, as a visitor, the  Appellant  was  not  entitled  to
       work, she would not have  been  entitled  to  a  national  insurance
       number.  There is limited evidence as to the  terms  and  conditions
       for student loans at the relevant time (now over fifteen years ago).
        However, based on the letters in the supplementary bundle  and  the
       terms of the declaration which I have set out, the position  appears
       to be that those resident outside the UK were entitled to apply  for
       a loan, and that no evidence was sought of nationality.

   30. However, the focus of the entitlement to the loan appears to be  the
       existence of a national insurance number.  The Appellant  of  course
       had one, and in that way, coupled with her birth certificate showing
       her place of birth in the UK, was able to obtain a student loan.   I
       accept, as  does  the  Respondent  as  I  understand  it,  that  the
       Appellant did not use false documents.  However, I  find  it  likely
       that, if she had not  had  a  national  insurance  number  when  she
       applied for the student loan, she would not have obtained one.


   31. I do not understand the Respondent to rely on  the  obtaining  of  a
       driving licence.  Certain categories of  foreign  nationals  are  no
       longer entitled to driving  licences.   However,  as  Mr  Youssefian
       submitted and I accept, what is now termed "the hostile environment"
       was not as prevalent  as  it  is  now  nor  as  well  monitored  and
       regulated.


   32. I did suggest to Mr Youssefian that it might be open to me  to  draw
       adverse inferences from the fact that  the  Appellant  supplied  her
       birth certificate rather than passport when she was asked to  verify
       her date and place of birth and identity  in  order  to  obtain  the
       loan.  However, I accept his answer to that  question.   Individuals
       are often far more reluctant to relinquish  the  original  of  their
       passport than their birth certificate as  it  is  a  more  important
       identity document and therefore its loss is of greater consequence.


   33. In relation to the evidence about the solicitor's advice, as  a  lay
       person, Mr Youssefian submitted I should conclude that the Appellant
       might have understood that she would become entitled to  citizenship
       even if not currently able to apply.  Although the Appellant studied
       law at university, I accept that it does not follow that she  is  to
       be considered other than as a lay person in relation to  nationality
       law.  He pointed out that this  was  one-off  advice  obtained  some
       fifteen years ago and it was  not  implausible  that  the  Appellant
       could not remember the detail.  She had not sought to embellish  her
       evidence in this regard.  Moreover, what she says she was advised is
       consistent with her seeking further advice some  five  years  or  so
       later in 2011.  By then, she had already completed her studies.


   34. Mr Youssefian said that I should not be  swayed  by  the  submission
       that the Appellant's entry as a visitor is key. It is after all  the
       case that some countries confer nationality merely on the  basis  of
       being born in that country. It is not implausible that the Appellant
       would believe that she needed to  complete  a  period  of  residence
       before making an application to obtain her citizenship.


   35. In relation to the student loan, Mr Youssefian also pointed out that
       the Appellant had tried to obtain  information  about  student  loan
       entitlement in 2005 via a Freedom of Information request but had not
       received a reply.  She has actively sought out evidence.


   36. Mr Youssefian pointed out that,  following  PS,  I  should  exercise
       great  caution  when  considering  the  "aggravating  circumstances"
       issue, because otherwise those who have behaved  negatively  in  the
       past would be dissuaded from returning  to  their  home  country  to
       obtain entry clearance.  Although he accepted that PS was decided on
       the "not in accordance with the law" ground, he  submitted  that  it
       was nonetheless still of application as discretion is  part  of  the
       public interest assessment under Article 8 ECHR.  He  also  accepted
       that Paragraph 320(11) does not contain any specific period of  time
       during which a breach will be held  against  an  individual  (unlike
       paragraph 320(7B)) but asserted that there had, in this case, been a
       sufficient  passage  of  time  since  the  conduct   alleged   which
       attenuates the public interest in relation to exclusion.

   37. In conclusion, Mr Youssefian asked me to consider the nature of  the
       aggravating circumstances (if they were to be so termed).   This  is
       not a case where the Appellant has used an assumed identity to evade
       immigration control.  She had not sought to go  under  the  radar  -
       quite the opposite.  She had eventually made a  voluntary  departure
       and even if she was at the end of the road by that stage, she  could
       have sought to stay to argue her case here.


    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS


   38. I begin by saying that I  do  not  place  any  less  weight  on  the
       Appellant's evidence because it could not be tested.  She  is  still
       in Nigeria and, even remotely, would have  had  some  difficulty  in
       participating in person.  I therefore take her evidence on its face.




   39. There are, though, some unusual features of her evidence even  taken
       that way.      First, she does not  explain  why  it  was  that  she
       sought the advice of a solicitor in 2005.  At that  point  in  time,
       she had returned from Nigeria following the death of her  father  in
       order to see her uncle.  She was aged nineteen at the time and could
       not have been unaware of her need for a visa to enter.  Even  though
       her mother may well have made the application for her  in  2003,  as
       she would then have been a minor, she could not have failed to  know
       that she needed permission to enter the UK and was not British.  She
       would have known that because she passed through the airport using a
       Nigerian passport bearing that permission.  It is therefore  I  find
       likely that the reason she sought advice at that  stage  is  because
       her permission to remain in the UK was about to or had just run  out
       (it must have expired after she re-entered as  otherwise  she  would
       have been stopped at the airport).


   40. Second, therefore, the Appellant was  aware  following  that  advice
       that she was, firstly, not British and, secondly, that  she  had  no
       permission to be in the UK.  She might have thought that  she  would
       be eligible to apply for citizenship after five years  but,  on  any
       view, she knew from that point in time that she could not do  so  in
       2005.


   41. Third, I accept that the Appellant seeking further advice in 2011 is
       consistent with her case that she thought she would be able to apply
       for citizenship after five years.  However, the words at [4] of  her
       first statement are, I find, carefully chosen.   She  does  not  say
       that she was shocked to find that she had overstayed but rather that
       she was shocked to learn that her overstaying would  disqualify  her
       from obtaining a passport.


   42. Based on the above, I find that the Appellant was  well  aware  that
       she was an overstayer from 2005  and  that  she  stayed  in  the  UK
       knowing that to be the position.  However, I accept that she did  so
       thinking that, after a period, she would be entitled to apply to  be
       a UK citizen because she had been born here.

   43.  The  central  question  which  arises  thereafter  is  whether  the
       Appellant used her time when she knew she  was  unlawfully  here  to
       obtain benefits to which she was not entitled in order to permit her
       to stay.  In other  words,  was  the  obtaining  of  those  benefits
       deliberate and designed for the purpose of enabling her to remain in
       the UK without leave?

   44. It is not entirely clear to me  why  the  Appellant  applied  for  a
       national insurance number.  It is not suggested  by  the  Respondent
       and I do not understand the Appellant's evidence to be that she ever
       worked in the UK.  It was therefore perhaps an unusual step to take.



   45. However, I accept the Appellant's evidence about the  way  in  which
       she  obtained  the  national  insurance  document.   It  is  perhaps
       surprising that she is able to give detail about  the  circumstances
       of applying for that document when she is unable to  remember  other
       events at that time, but her evidence in that regard  has  not  been
       disputed.  In any event, as I  have  already  noted,  the  so-called
       "hostile environment" was not in being in the  same  way  as  it  is
       today and it is, I find, quite likely that the  Department  of  Work
       and Pensions would have given the  Appellant  a  national  insurance
       number even though she was very clearly, in my view, not entitled to
       it as her conditions of leave  (which  had  in  any  event  by  then
       expired) did not permit her to work.

   46. It may well be the case that the Appellant sought and  obtained  the
       national insurance number in order to permit her to study.  I accept
       that she must have known that she was not  entitled  to  a  national
       insurance number as, by that  stage,  she  knew  that  she  was  not
       lawfully in the UK.  That does not however mean that she necessarily
       knew that she was not entitled to study and, more importantly,  that
       she was not entitled to apply for an obtain a student loan.


   47. I have already pointed to some of the provisions of the  declaration
       which the Appellant was asked to sign  which  might  appear  to  the
       untutored eye to suggest that just because she came from outside the
       UK did not preclude her from seeking a loan.  The loan company asked
       only for proof of her date and place of birth  and  confirmation  of
       her identity.  I do not draw any adverse inferences  from  the  fact
       that she used her birth certificate as that proof  rather  than  her
       passport for the reasons I have already given.  It is not  suggested
       that she assumed any different identity or details of identity which
       were not her own.  It is not  suggested  that  she  used  any  false
       documents to obtain these benefits.


   48. For those reasons, I find that the Appellant was not aware that  she
       was not entitled to the student loan  which  she  obtained.   It  is
       perhaps to her credit that she is taking steps to repay the loan.


   49. The position in relation to entitlement to study is  not  quite  the
       same.  As I have already pointed out, there has been a  category  of
       visa for study for very many years  and  one  certainly  existed  in
       2005/2006 when the Appellant started her studies.  I have  not  been
       provided with a copy of the  Appellant's  passport  but  it  is  not
       suggested that this would not have included the usual conditions for
       a visitor on the visa namely that she was not  allowed  to  work  or
       study without specific permission.  It is notable that the Appellant
       talks about the obtaining of the other benefits such as the loan and
       even the driving licence but says very little about her  application
       to study when her conditions of stay (when she had leave)  prevented
       her from doing so.

   50. I find that the Appellant was well aware that she was  not  entitled
       to study.  In fact, she could not help but be aware of  that  since,
       as I have already found, she knew that she had no right to  be  here
       at all.  That does not however affect my view that she was not aware
       that she had no right to the student loan.  Although I have accepted
       that she must also have known that she had no right to the  national
       insurance number, the issue  I  have  to  consider  is  whether  the
       obtaining of these benefits  amounts  to  aggravating  circumstances
       which add to the contriving "in a significant way to  frustrate  the
       intentions of the Rules".


   51. In this regard, I  do  not  agree  with  Judge  Landes  that  "[t]he
       obtaining  of  goods  or  services  are  not  circumstances  bearing
       directly on the respondent's ability to control  immigration".   The
       Respondent's guidance refers to the receipt of  benefits,  goods  or
       services  without  an  entitlement  as  an  example  of   aggravated
       circumstances.  The fact that this is not an  example  in  Paragraph
       320(11) itself is nothing to the point.  As I pointed out at [19] of
       my error of law decision, the examples given in the rule itself  are
       a non-exhaustive list and,  as  I  note  above,  and  Mr  Youssefian
       accepted (as recorded at [20] of my  error  of  law  decision),  the
       published policy supports the  obtaining  of  benefits  as  being  a
       potential aggravating circumstance.


   52. One can well conceive of scenarios where the obtaining  of  benefits
       to  which  an  individual  is  not  entitled  are   an   aggravating
       circumstance.   The  obtaining  of  a  national  insurance   number,
       enabling an individual to  work  and  therefore  to  earn  money  to
       finance a continued unlawful stay is quite sufficient  to  aggravate
       the overstaying and breach of conditions.


   53. However, in this case, the obtaining of the benefits  to  which  the
       Appellant was not entitled are of a different nature.  She may  well
       have obtained a national insurance  number  to  which  she  was  not
       entitled in order to study.  She studied when she knew  she  had  no
       right to do so.  However, that did not have any causative effect  on
       her overstaying.

   54. In the current climate, the Appellant's unauthorised stay  may  well
       have been detected much sooner or even stopped at its inception when
       she tried to obtain these benefits  and  make  her  applications  to
       study.  As Mr Youssefian pointed out, though, this  is  not  a  case
       where the Appellant has obtained these benefits in order  to  remain
       under the radar to avoid detection.  She willingly engaged with  the
       authorities to obtain these benefits.

   55. The benefits should not of course have been given to  the  Appellant
       and I have already found that she must have known that at least  the
       national insurance  number  was  not  something  to  which  she  was
       entitled and that she should  not  have  been  studying.   There  is
       though insufficient evidence to show that she did all this with  the
       intention to  "contrive  in  a  significant  way  to  frustrate  the
       intentions of the Rules"; in other words, to enable her to  continue
       to stay in the UK unlawfully.  She did not use any  false  documents
       and there is no evidence that she lied to the authorities about  her
       nationality.  It appears that she simply was not asked and therefore
       did not say that she was not British.

   56. For those reasons, I accept that, although the Appellant did  obtain
       benefits and services to which she  was  undoubtedly  not  entitled,
       that does not amount to aggravating circumstances for  the  purposes
       of Paragraph 320(11).


   57. I should add that the Appellant in this case has  done  herself  few
       favours in the way in which her evidence has been presented.  It  is
       not to her credit that she has continued  to  insist  that  she  did
       little wrong other than to stay for a short while  longer  than  she
       was entitled to do.  She knew that she had no  entitlement  to  stay
       since 2005 and stayed regardless.  If  it  had  become  relevant  to
       consider whether it was to her credit that she left  voluntarily,  I
       would have had no hesitation in finding that it was not.  She stayed
       for a significant period after she knew that her leave  had  expired
       and whatever she thought about her entitlement to  citizenship,  she
       knew by the latest in 2011 that she was not so entitled and did  not
       leave the UK until 2015 and then only after she had met Mr  [O]  and
       therefore doubtless saw another way of being allowed to  gain  entry
       lawfully to this country.


   58. However, since I have concluded that the obtaining of  benefits  and
       services to which the Appellant was not entitled does not amount  to
       an aggravating circumstance for the purposes of  Paragraph  320(11),
       it follows that this paragraph does not apply.  Since that  was  the
       only reason for refusing the Appellant on  suitability  grounds  and
       since suitability grounds were the  only  reason  for  refusing  the
       Appellant's application to join her partner in the  UK,  it  follows
       that this appeal must be allowed on the  basis  that  the  Appellant
       meets the Immigration Rules (under Appendix FM).  There is therefore
       no public interest in requiring her continued exclusion from the UK.
        Although she has overstayed in the UK previously (and knew that she
       was here without permission), she has finally done the  right  thing
       and returned home to apply for re-entry.   For  those  reasons,  the
       Appellant succeeds  on  human  rights  grounds  and  her  appeal  is
       allowed.

The Appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights (Article 8 ECHR) grounds

                            DECISION AND REASONS


    BACKGROUND


    1. The Appellant appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Rowlands  promulgated  on  29  August  2019  ("the  Decision")
       dismissing the Appellant's appeal on human rights grounds (Article 8
       ECHR).  The Appellant is a national of Nigeria.   Her  human  rights
       claim is based on her relationship with her fiance, Utchay [O],  who
       is a citizen of Nigeria but also a British citizen by birth.


    2. The Appellant's human rights claim was refused by the Respondent  by
       the decision under appeal, dated 7 August 2018 made in  the  context
       of the refusal of an application for entry  clearance  to  join  her
       fianc� in the UK.  Although the Appellant has in the past overstayed
       in the UK, she made a  voluntary  departure  to  Nigeria  thereafter
       where she remains.


    3. The Respondent's reason for refusing the  claim  was  based  on  the
       general  grounds  of  refusal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the
       Rules"), specifically paragraph 320(11)  based  on  the  Appellant's
       overstaying which was said to be aggravated by two  police  cautions
       when the Appellant claimed to be British.  The Respondent  otherwise
       accepted that the Appellant met the Rules to join her  fianc�.   The
       Judge found paragraph 320(11) to be satisfied although  the  matters
       which he relied upon as the aggravating circumstances were  not  the
       same as those initially put forward by the Respondent.  He relied on
       the Appellant having obtained a student loan and university place to
       which she was not, as a  foreign  student,  entitled.  He  therefore
       found that the Appellant could not succeed under the Rules and  that
       there were no circumstances on which she could succeed  outside  the
       Rules.  For those reasons, he dismissed the appeal.


    4. The Appellant appeals on three grounds.  First, she asserts that the
       Judge failed to  direct  himself  to  the  guidance  given  by  this
       Tribunal in PS (paragraph 320(11)  discretion:  care  needed)  India
       [2010] UKUT 440 (IAC) ("PS (India)").  Second, she says  that  there
       were  no  "aggravating  circumstances"  in  this  case  which  could
       properly fall within paragraph 320(11).  Third, it is suggested that
       the Judge acted improperly by having regard to his own researches as
       to the criteria which apply in order to be eligible  for  a  student
       loan.

    5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes
       on 20 December 2019 in the following terms so far as relevant:

           "..2. It is arguable as set out at paragraph 7 grounds that  the
           appellant's conduct does not fall within  paragraph  320(11)  in
           that the aggravating circumstances listed in  paragraph  320(11)
           are  circumstances  which  bear  directly  on  the  respondent's
           ability to control immigration and it is arguable therefore that
           other aggravating circumstances need to be of the same  type  to
           fall within paragraph 320(11) ('such  as').   The  obtaining  of
           goods or services are not circumstances bearing directly on  the
           respondent's ability to control immigration.
           3.     It  is  also  arguable  that  there  was   a   procedural
           irregularity in that there appears  to  have  been  no  evidence
           before the judge what the criteria for obtaining a student  loan
           were at the time the appellant applied.  The judge did  not  put
           to the sponsor or the appellant's representative that those were
           the criteria for obtaining a student loan.  Whilst, despite what
           is said in the grounds, the appellant was evidently not entitled
           to study at university or to a student loan (judicial notice can
           be taken of the fact that those who overstay are not entitled to
           study at university and for that reason if for no  other  reason
           not entitled to a student loan) the criteria/the clarity of  the
           criteria are relevant to the appellant's knowledge that she  was
           not so entitled and hence to  how  serious  (or  otherwise)  her
           conduct was.
           4.    Whilst I do not restrict the grounds which may be  argued,
           I do not consider that the judge erred by failing to  apply  PS.
           PS makes clear that care has to be taken to ensure that what are
           said to be the aggravating circumstances are  truly  aggravating
           as if they are not the provision will encourage people to remain
           in the UK unlawfully rather than regularising their status.  The
           judge  explained  why  he  considered  the  circumstances   were
           aggravating at [11].   If  the  circumstances  did  indeed  come
           within 320(11) and  if  he  was  right  as  to  the  appellant's
           deliberately obtaining benefits to which she was not entitled by
           giving a false impression of her status, it is difficult to  see
           how the judge could have reached any other conclusion than  that
           the circumstances were truly aggravating."


    6. The matter  comes  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  Decision
       contains a material error of law and, if it  does,  to  re-make  the
       decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.


    DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS


    7. It is appropriate to take the Appellant's grounds in  reverse  order
       not least because of the comments made in the grant of permission.


    GROUND THREE


    8. The Judge made the findings of which complaint is made  at  [10]  of
       the Decision as follows:


           "Knowing that she was not a UK citizen  she  stayed  in  the  UK
           without leave six months after she first entered in  2005.   Not
           only that she applied for a university place and a student  loan
           knowing that she  was  not  entitled  to  either  as  a  foreign
           student.  The eligibility rules for a student loan  are  crystal
           clear.  You can apply if you are:-
           A UK national or have settled status;
           You normally live in England;
           You have been living in the United Kingdom, the Channel  Islands
           or the Isle of Man for three years before starting your course."


    9. I begin by observing that the Appellant does not say that the  Judge
       was wrong about the relevant criteria.  Mr Youssefian said he simply
       did not know what those were.  He had not  checked.   His  point  is
       rather that the Judge should have alerted the parties if he intended
       to rely on his own researches.  For the reasons which follow,  I  do
       not accept that submission.


   10. First, the Appellant was on notice from  the  Respondent's  decision
       that the Respondent's case was, at the very least, that she had  not
       been entitled to study at a  UK  university  as  a  foreign  student
       without the necessary permission.  Although I accept that this is  a
       point  which  was  not  directly  relied  upon  as  the  aggravating
       circumstance under paragraph 320(11), it  was  nonetheless  asserted
       that she was not entitled to study in the UK  without  the  relevant
       leave.


   11. Second, the Judge did not  solely  rely  on  the  obtaining  of  the
       student loan but also the obtaining of a university place.  That was
       the position of the Respondent in her decision.



   12. Third, as Judge Landes pointed out, the Judge was entitled  to  take
       judicial notice as  to  that  fact.   Although  I  accept  that  the
       criteria set out at [10] of the Decision are quite  specific  as  to
       the  obtaining  of  a  student  loan,  nothing  is  said  about  the
       allegation that the Appellant had obtained a student  place  without
       permission to study as a foreign student.  It is not entirely  clear
       that what is said by the Judge at [10] about student loans is  based
       on internet research but, even if those criteria are  taken  out  of
       the equation, the allegation still stands that the Appellant studied
       at a UK university when she was not entitled to do so.    She  never
       had leave to remain as a student.  She was only ever here with leave
       as a visitor.


   13. Fourth, and most importantly, it is not the  Appellant's  case  that
       she was entitled to a NI number, a student loan  or  the  places  at
       University.  Her case as set  out  in  her  statement  is  that  she
       obtained those benefits because she believed that she  was  entitled
       to them because she had a British birth certificate.  She  does  not
       take issue with the allegation that she was not  entitled  to  these
       things, but she says that the obtaining of them did  not  amount  to
       deception because she simply did not realise that  she  was  not  so
       entitled.  I will return to that point below because, if there is an
       error in this regard, it is, as Judge Landes said, the importance of
       what the Appellant believed about her entitlement and not her actual
       entitlement.


    GROUND TWO


   14. Paragraph 320(11) of the Rules reads as follows:


          "(11) where the applicant has previously contrived in a
          significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Rules by:
             (i) overstaying; or
             (ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or
             (iii) being an illegal entrant; or
             (iv) using deception in an application for entry clearance,
             leave to enter or remain or in order to obtain documents from
             the Secretary of State or a third party required in support of
             the application (whether successful or not);
           and there are other aggravating circumstances, such as
           absconding, not meeting temporary admission/reporting
           restrictions or bail conditions, using an assumed identity or
           multiple identities, switching nationality, making frivolous
           applications or not complying with the re-documentation
           process."


   15. My attention  was  also  drawn  to  Home  Office  guidance  entitled
       "General grounds for refusal: Section  2  of  5:  Considering  entry
       clearance" published on 11 January  2018  the  relevant  section  of
       which reads as follows:


           "When an applicant has previously breached the Immigration Rules
           and/or received services or  support  to  which  they  were  not
           entitled you must consider refusing the application.  When these
           circumstances are also aggravated  by  other  actions  with  the
           intention to deliberately frustrate the rules, you  must  refuse
           entry clearance under paragraph 320(11)
           This means when an  applicant  has  done  one  or  more  of  the
           following:
               . Been an illegal entrant
               . Overstayed
               . Breached a condition attached to their leave
               . Used deception in a previous application
               . Obtaining:
                     o Asylum benefits
                     o State benefits
                     o Housing benefits
                     o Tax credits
                     o Employment
                     o Goods or services
                     o National Health Service (NHS) care using  an  assumed
                       identity or  multiple  identities  or  to  which  not
                       entitled
           And there are aggravating circumstances, such as:
                 ...
               . Receiving benefits, goods or services when not entitled
              ...
               . Switching nationality
           This is not a complete list of offences.  You must consider  all
           cases on their merits and take into account family life  in  the
           UK and, if the applicant is a child, the level of responsibility
           for any breach...."


   16. The Judge dealt with the paragraph 320(11)  issue  at  [12]  of  the
       Decision as follows:


           "I have applied these findings of fact to this  case  and  reach
           the conclusion that her appeal must fail.  Her  application  has
           been refused under paragraph 320(11) which states that it  is  a
           ground where entry clearance should normally be refused  at  the
           discretion of the Respondent where an applicant  has  previously
           contrived in a significant way to frustrate the intention of the
           Rules by overstaying or breaching a condition  attached  to  her
           leave and there are  other  aggravating  circumstances  such  as
           absconding and other examples.  It is argued that  she  has  not
           absconded and not broken any temporary  admission  or  reporting
           restrictions and not used any assumed identities all of which is
           true, but it ignores completely the fact that she overstayed for
           many years.  The general grounds of refusal provide  that  there
           are other matters which  should  be  taken  into  consideration,
           including overstaying, breaching a condition attached  to  their
           leave and using or obtaining goods or services  or  benefits  to
           which they are not entitled.  I have already  made  my  decision
           absolutely clear, this young lady  was  not  entitled  to  enter
           university for either of the two degrees that  she  did  at  the
           rate applicable for UK students and she knew  it.   Neither  was
           she entitled to obtain a student loan and she  knew  that.   She
           was  not  entitled  to  work  either.   Whatever  she  may  have
           presented in order to get a national insurance  number  she  was
           not entitled to  it  she  was  here  only  as  a  visitor.   The
           conditions of visit visas are perfectly clear and employment  is
           not allowed and would have been stated  as  such  on  her  visit
           visa.  The Respondent suggests that she switched nationality  at
           some point or other I am not sure that be the case  because  the
           reality is that she has breached  a  number  of  the  conditions
           attached to visit visas knowingly.  She has obtained the benefit
           of lesser university fees which is a significant amount of money
           running into many thousands of  pounds  and  a  loan  which  she
           seemingly still owes for her time here as  student.   These  are
           significant breaches.  I note that the family life in the United
           Kingdom should be taken into account but quite clearly this  was
           always on the basis of the Appellant and her fianc� knowing  for
           quite some time that she had no status  here.   Why  else  would
           somebody who was as eminently qualified as her not  be  working.
           The Respondent was perfectly right to exercise their  discretion
           not to allow her application."


       I pause to observe that although, as Mr Youssefian submitted,  those
       findings are expressed in strident terms, they do not  overstep  the
       mark in terms of indicating any bias against the Appellant  and  nor
       does any such assertion appear in the Appellant's grounds.


   17. That passage follows the findings made by the Judge on the  evidence
       concerning the so-called aggravating circumstances.  I have  already
       cited  [10]  of  the  Decision  in  the  context  of  ground  three.
       Paragraph [11] of the Decision is  also  relevant.   That  reads  as
       follows:


           "None of those three [that is to say the  criteria  for  student
           loans set out at [10] of the Decision] applied to  her  and  yet
           she applied for a student loan and university place which  again
           is restricted to people in similar categories on the back of her
           birth certificate and national insurance number which  she  knew
           was presenting a  false  impression  to  people  of  her  actual
           status.  By  2011  she  had  a  law  degree  and  a  Masters  in
           International Commercial Law and claims  to  have  made  another
           application in 2011 or 2012 which was  refused,  even  then  she
           remained for another three years before leaving.  She says  that
           she should have been given some kind of credit for the fact that
           she voluntarily left on  16th  June  2015.   Quite  frankly  she
           deserves no credit at all for having remained unlawfully after a
           supposed refusal in 2012 during which time she  and  her  fianc�
           continued with their relationship knowing full well that she was
           here illegally and that her status was  precarious  to  say  the
           least.  I am satisfied that she obtained  a  national  insurance
           number knowing that she was not entitled to it and  had  reduced
           university fees and student loan all at the cost to the  British
           tax-payer.  Her suggestion that she didn't know and thought  she
           was British is nonsense.  She knew all  along  that  she  didn't
           have the right and deliberately continued with the fa�ade."


   18. I begin by noting that the Respondent herself did not find there  to
       be aggravating circumstances due to the  obtaining  of  the  student
       loan and place at university but rather that the Appellant had  said
       she was British when cautioned by the police  which  the  Respondent
       said amounted to "switching nationality".  I did not  understand  Mr
       Youssefian to dispute that this could come  within  the  aggravating
       circumstances or, put another way,  that  what  occurred,  could  be
       described as such.  It is said on behalf of the Appellant  that  the
       Judge did not accept this.  I do not think that her case can be  put
       so strongly.  As appears at [12] of the Decision cited above all the
       Judge says is that he is "not sure that be the  case".   Of  course,
       the relevant standard of proof is not certainty.   Whilst  I  accept
       that the Judge did not make any proper finding one way or the other,
       I do not accept that the Judge rejected  the  Respondent's  case  on
       this point.


   19. In relation  to  the  reasons  on  which  the  Judge  did  rely,  Mr
       Youssefian rightly accepted that the aggravating circumstances which
       are set out at paragraph 320(11) are  a  non-exhaustive  list.   His
       point is that such  circumstances  have  to  fall  within  the  same
       category which he described as  being  actions  or  omissions  which
       prevent the Respondent from exercising and  maintaining  immigration
       control which, as appears from  what  precedes  the  description  of
       aggravating circumstances is, he said, linked to immigration status.


   20. Mr  Youssefian  accepted  that  the  Respondent's  published  policy
       supports the Judge's reasoning.   However,  he  submitted  that  the
       Rules cannot be interpreted by a policy if that policy confines  the
       rule.  The Respondent can be more generous by her policy than a rule
       provides.  However, as he pointed out, based on what is  said  in  R
       (oao Alvi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012]  UKSC
       33, in order to achieve the necessary certainty, matters which go to
       the question of whether and when leave to enter or remain should  be
       granted or refused should be specified in the Rules and not left  to
       guidance.


   21. I begin by noting that if and insofar  as  the  Respondent's  policy
       suggests that the first  part  of  paragraph  320(11)  includes  the
       frustration of the Rules by the obtaining of  benefits  to  which  a
       person is not entitled, it is inconsistent  with  the  rule  itself.
       That does not  fall  within  sub-paragraphs  (i)  to  (iv)  at  all.
       However, neither do I accept Mr Youssefian's  submission  that  such
       behaviour is not consistent with the other circumstances set out  in
       paragraph 320(11).  It is legitimate to point out that  such  things
       as absconding or not meeting bail conditions are clearly  linked  to
       the status of overstaying or illegal entry.  I pause to observe that
       it is not here said that those circumstances apply.

   22. However, Mr Youssefian's submission ignores sub-paragraphs (ii)  and
       (iv) of paragraph 320(11) which concern the breach of conditions  or
       the use of deception.  Certain of the factors set out in the  second
       part of paragraph 320(11) are obviously intended to relate to  those
       sub-paragraphs, for example, the  use  of  an  assumed  identity  is
       relevant to the use  of  deception.   The  reference  to  "switching
       nationality" may be similarly  relevant  in  that  regard  (and  was
       relied upon by the Respondent here as a reason why  the  overstaying
       was aggravated).  However, there are clearly other circumstances not
       there mentioned which relate to those sub-paragraphs.  For  example,
       it cannot sensibly be said that someone who is working in breach  of
       conditions by obtaining a  document  to  which  he  or  she  is  not
       entitled has not aggravated the breach  of  conditions  requirement.
       Yet, there is no actual mention  in  the  aggravating  circumstances
       section of paragraph 320(11) that the obtaining of a false  document
       is such a circumstance, but it must be so.

   23. Mr Youssefian's categorisation of  the  nature  of  the  harm  which
       paragraph 320(11) is designed to  prevent  against  is  also,  if  I
       understood that  submission  correctly  and  with  respect  to  him,
       slightly simplistic.  There is no doubt that some of the aggravating
       features go to the ability to remove a person but that  is  not  the
       only facet of immigration control.  If a person is not  entitled  to
       remain in the UK, that he or she manages to do  so  by  obtaining  a
       means of support to  which  they  are  not  entitled  and  therefore
       manages to stay below the radar in order to avoid  removal  is  also
       relevant to the maintenance of immigration control.

   24. For those reasons, I do not accept that the obtaining of benefits to
       which a person is not entitled  is  not  a  circumstance  which  can
       aggravate the behaviours set  out  in  paragraphs  (i)  to  (iv)  of
       paragraph 320(11).   It is a circumstance of a similar  nature.   Mr
       Youssefian accepted that the list is not exhaustive.  I accept  that
       it may be preferable if this were spelt out, particularly given  the
       wording of the policy but I do not accept, given the  way  in  which
       the rule is phrased, that the Respondent has to  particularise  each
       and every circumstance which can aggravate the  behaviours  in  sub-
       paragraphs (i) to (iv).

   25. That the circumstances here  are  capable  of  being  an  aggravated
       circumstance is not however the end of the  matter.   The  issue  is
       whether the circumstance has aggravated  the  behaviour.   In  other
       words, that the Appellant overstayed and  moreover  on  the  Judge's
       analysis breached conditions of her leave, is relevant but the issue
       is whether the behaviour of the Appellant  has  been  aggravated  by
       those circumstances.  That  involves  the  taking  into  account  of
       whether she was aware that  what  she  was  doing  was  wrong.   The
       circumstances said to aggravate the overstaying  etc  are  all  ones
       which involve some deliberate conduct on the part of  an  applicant.
       The Judge therefore needed to consider the Appellant's own  evidence
       as to how and why she obtained the documents and services which  she
       did and needed to make findings about that evidence.   That  is  the
       point made at [3] of Judge Landes' grant of  permission.   There  is
       also a failure by Judge Rowlands to make a  finding  on  the  reason
       relied upon by the Respondent.


   26. For those reasons, I find an error of law on ground two.


    GROUND ONE


   27. Having reached my conclusion on  ground  two,  it  is  not  strictly
       necessary for me to deal with ground one, but I do for completeness.
        I can do so shortly.   I  reject  that  ground  for  the  following
       reasons.


   28. First, the Appellant was legally  represented.   Although  there  is
       reference to PS (India) in the skeleton  argument  for  the  hearing
       before Judge Rowlands, that reference does no more than  repeat  the
       guidance.


   29. Second, and for that reason, I do not  accept  that  the  Judge  was
       bound to have regard to it. The Judge had determined that there were
       aggravating circumstances.  The only point which  then  remained  is
       the credit to be given to  a  voluntary  departure.   As  the  Judge
       pointed out at [11]  of  the  Decision,  however  and  as  Mr  Tufan
       reiterated, this was a voluntary  departure  in  name  only  as  the
       Appellant had come to the end of the line in  terms  of  immigration
       applications and would  have  been  removed  if  she  had  not  left
       voluntarily.  She knew by that time that she had no right to  remain
       and should have left long before she did.


   30. Third, as Mr Tufan pointed out, the  factual  circumstances  of  the
       appellant in PS (India) are very far removed from the present  case.
       The appellant there was married to his wife and  had  returned  when
       his asylum claim, and an application to remain had been rejected  in
       order  to  obtain  entry  clearance.   More  importantly,  paragraph
       320(11) was in very different terms to the current version  and  the
       decision was based in part on the interaction of  paragraph  320(7C)
       and 320(11) of the Rules.


   31. The case of PS (India) had no obvious bearing on  the  present  case
       given the Judge's findings, and there was no reason for the Judge to
       refer  to  it,  having  determined  that  there   were   aggravating
       circumstances. This ground adds nothing, as Judge Landes pointed out
       when granting permission.


    CONCLUSION

   32. I find an error of law on ground two.  The Judge found there  to  be
       aggravating circumstances without taking account of the  Appellant's
       evidence as to the manner in which and reasons why she had  obtained
       the documents and services which she had.  The Judge also failed  to
       make any finding on the reason given by the Respondent for  applying
       paragraph 320(11).


   33. For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that the Decision contains
       a material error of law.  I set aside the  Decision.   I  have  made
       directions below for a resumed hearing.


   34. Mr Youssefian invited me to remit the appeal if I  found  an  error.
       He accepted however that the appeal could remain  in  this  Tribunal
       provided there was a resumed hearing. I consider it appropriate  for
       the decision to be re-made in this Tribunal.  Although there may  be
       a degree of fact finding needed when re-making the Decision, that is
       likely to be limited and the facts of  the  case  are  not  complex.
       Although I appreciate that it is unlikely that  the  Appellant  will
       give evidence and therefore that her written evidence will be tested
       orally, I consider it appropriate for there to be a resumed  hearing
       and I have given directions below for that hearing.


DECISION

I am satisfied that the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rowlands
promulgated on 29 August 2019 discloses an error of law.  I set  aside  that
decision.  I make the following directions for a resumed hearing:
   1. Within 28 days from the date when this decision is sent, the Appellant
      shall file with the Tribunal and serve on the Respondent  any  further
      evidence on which she wishes to rely.
   2. The resumed hearing is to be relisted before me on the first available
      date after six weeks from the date when this decision is sent  with  a
      time estimate of � day.
