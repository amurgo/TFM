Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr David


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is a citizen of  Poland  and
       hence an EEA national. He was born in 1975. On  5  August  2015  the
       appellant (hereafter the Secretary of State for the Home  Department
       or SSHD) decided to make  a  deportation  order  against  him  under
       regulation 19(3)(b) of the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Areas)
       Regulations  2006  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy  and  public
       security. That order was said to be consistent with the criteria set
       out in regulation 21, which provides:




    "Decisions taken on public policy, public security  and  public  health
    grounds

    21. -    (1)  In this regulation a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
             of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

             (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
             necessary in his  best  interests,  as  provided  for  in  the
             Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by  the  General
             Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.

         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin.

         (7)  In the case of a relevant decision taken on grounds of  public
         health-

             (a)  a disease  that  does  not  have  epidemic  potential  as
             defined by  the  relevant  instruments  of  the  World  Health
             Organisation or is not a disease to which section  38  of  the
             Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 applies (detention
             in hospital of a person with a notifiable disease)  shall  not
             constitute grounds for the decision; and

             (b)  if  the  person  concerned  is  in  the  United  Kingdom,
             diseases occurring after the three month period  beginning  on
             the date on which he arrived in the United Kingdom  shall  not
             constitute grounds for the decision."

    2. The claimant came to the UK with his family in 2011 and it is not in
       dispute that whilst here he has been exercising Treaty rights either
       as a self-employed person or employed person by working as  a  motor
       mechanic. His family comprises his partner and  their  two  children
       who are both minors and attending school in Leicester. His  partner,
       who is also Polish, is now working and supporting the family.

    3. The claimant had a conviction and suspended sentence in  Germany  in
       2009 for trafficking cigarettes on the Polish/German border. But the
       SSHD's immediate reason for the decision to deport was the fact that
       on 10 April 2015 he had been sentenced to 16 months imprisonment for
       fraudulently evading customs duty. On 3 August 2013 customs officers
       had found half a million east European cigarettes on  a  farm  in  a
       country village which the claimant had  rented.  The  duty  due  was
       �104,000 but that was in fact a second batch of a  consignment,  the
       claimant having already disposed of the first batch. The  sentencing
       judge noted that the claimant accepted that the  total  duty  evaded
       was a little over �200,000 and that the claimant's was  a  middleman
       role. The sentencing judge noted that the claimant had willingly and
       freely got involved with serious  criminals  on  the  Polish/Germany
       border and added: "Because you were caught [there],  they  took  the
       view that you owed them money and I accept that  you  came  to  this
       country in order to put a distance between you and  them,  but  that
       they traced you and required you to carry on  dealing  in  un-dutied
       cigarettes as a means of paying off  that  debt".  Whilst  accepting
       this scenario, the sentencing judge went on to say that he  did  not
       accept the claimant's was in consequence a simple case  of  coercion
       or intimidation:

    "I do not accept that for this reason; your involvement with that  gang
    originally was entirely voluntary as a result of your own  free  choice
    to get involved in crime on the German/Polish border and those who team
    up with serious criminals cannot then claim that as a  result  of  that
    they are being pressured when they don't like it  later  on.   However,
    there is some small mitigation on your behalf  and  I  have  regard  to
    that, that you attempted to put distance between yourself and them."

    4. Against the decision  to  deport  him  the  claimant  appealed.  The
       claimant was removed  to  Poland  on  27  August  2015  following  a
       decision by the SSHD to certify his appeal under regulation 24AA. He
       was not therefore present for the appeal hearing fixed before  First
       tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge R  A  Cox  in  November  2015.  The  judge
       recorded that the SSHD  had  refused  an  application  made  by  the
       claimant to enter the UK to attend his appeal hearing.

    5. In the absence of the claimant the judge  heard  evidence  from  the
       claimant's partner who spoke, inter alia, about her working  history
       in the UK and the couple's children, the claimant's work in  the  UK
       as a car mechanic, the  children's  close  attachment  to  him,  the
       distress they had suffered while he was in prison  and  abroad;  her
       belief that the claimant would not offend again as the claimant  had
       learnt his lesson, and the fact that the present separation from his
       family had been a great lesson to him, as well, so he would not  get
       into to trouble  again.

    6. In a decision sent on 23 November 2015 Judge Cox allowed his  appeal
       essentially because he did not consider that the  claimant  posed  a
       present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  having  regard  to  his
       personal conduct. At [16] the judge stated:

    "In my finding, he did not come here in  2011  with  the  intention  of
    committing criminal offences, quite the reverse, and  there  is,  as  I
    have said, nothing before me to suggest that he was previously any sort
    of serial offender. I do not know what caused him to get involved  with
    the gang on the Polish/German border but the fact that he was  given  a
    suspended sentence by the  German  court  does  not  suggest  that  his
    involvement was high level.  I  find  as  a  fact  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that he would have not  have  offended  against  but  for
    being tracked by the gang after coming to the UK. I add to that,  as  I
    should, his evident remorse as  illustrated  by  his  immediate  guilty
    pleas, and as the judge commented, his frankness with the police.

    In sum, therefore, I do not find  it  probable,  especially  given  his
    family responsibilities and given also that he now knows  the  risk  of
    expulsion he would continue to run if he were to offend  again  in  the
    UK, that he will now  or  henceforth  represent  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to British society..."

    7. The SSHD's grounds contend that the judge had  materially  erred  in
       finding that the claimant did not present  a  genuine,  present  and
       sufficiently serious threat to society. This was said to be  because
       the judge made no mention of whether there was any information  that
       the claimant had engaged with rehabilitation in the UK or otherwise.
       That undermined the finding that the claimant  would  not  re-offend
       and failed to take into  account  that  he  had  recently  committed
       another offence very similar to the one had had committed  in  2009.
       It was submitted that the judge  had  not  adequately  reasoned  why
       rehabilitation could not take place in  Poland  or  why  the  family
       could not return with the claimant to  assist  him.  The  judge  had
       noted that the claimant  was  born  in  Poland  and  had  spent  the
       majority of his life there.

    8. The  grounds  also  attacked  the  judge's  reasoning  in  attaching
       significant weight to the fact that in 2011  the  claimant  had  not
       come to the UK with the intention  of  not  committing  any  further
       offences. This was said to have been wrong because in fact did go on
       to commit such offences and the sentencing judge  had  not  accepted
       this was because of coercion or intimidation. Further, the  claimant
       was in a relationship before the offence and his family  had  proved
       unable to deter him.

    9. I am grateful to both parties for their concise submissions.  In his
       Mr Mills highlighted that the judge had failed to consider that  the
       underlying reason why the claimant had offended was an unpaid  debt,
       yet the judge had  failed  to  take  into  account  that  that  debt
       remained unpaid and the gang who had traced  him  in  the  UK  would
       still have an interest in wanting it repaid. When  previously  faced
       with a choice as to whether to go to the police,  the  claimant  had
       not done so and there was no reason to think that  he  would  again.
       The fact that the criminal gang had  kept  away  from  the  claimant
       since his arrest did not mean they would  not  approach  him  again,
       once his deportation challenge was resolved. Mr David submitted that
       there was no evidence to indicate that subsequent to the  claimant's
       arrest and conviction the gang had made any approaches  to  him.  As
       regards rehabilitation  Mr  Mills  reiterated  the  point  that  the
       claimant's family responsibilities  had  not  stopped  the  claimant
       offending before. Mr David argued that the  judge  had  not  treated
       rehabilitation as a  factor  of  any  particular  significance.  The
       partner's evidence, which the judge was entitled to accept, was that
       the clamant  had  not  previously  understood  the  consequences  of
       offending in terms of separation from his family.

   10. There is no dispute that the claimant'[s case  fell  to  be  decided
       under the  2006  Regulations  as  to  whether  his  deportation  was
       justified on grounds of public policy or  public  security.  It  was
       accepted by Mr David that the  claimant  had  not  exercised  Treaty
       rights for five years and so could not pray in aid the higher  level
       of protection based on a need on  the  part  of  the  SSHD  to  show
       "serious grounds of public policy or security..."

   11. In assessing the claimant's case there are two cases  of  particular
       importance. One is Straszewski v Secreatry of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2015] EWCA Civ 1245. In that  judgment  Moore  Bick  was
       concerned with the case of a person who  had  acquired  a  right  of
       permanent residence, but at [30] expressed in general terms the view
       that  save in exceptional  circumstances  the  decision  on  whether
       deportation is consistent with the Directive:

    "...is to be determined solely by  reference  to  the  conduct  of  the
    offender (no doubt viewed in the context of any previous offending) and
    the likelihood of re-offending. General  considerations  of  deterrence
    and public revulsion normally have no part to play in the matter."

   12. At [25] Moore-Bick noted:

    ""Public policy" for  these  purposes  includes  the  policy  which  is
    reflected in the interest of the state in protecting its citizens  from
    violent crime and the theft of their property.  These  are  fundamental
    interests of society and therefore, although regulation 21(3) does  not
    speak in terms of the risk of causing harm by future  offending,  in  a
    case of this kind that is the risk which  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    called upon to assess when considering deportation.  That  requires  an
    evaluation to be made of the likelihood that the person concerned  will
    offend again and what the consequences are likely to be if he does.  In
    addition, the need for the conduct of the person concerned to represent
    a "sufficiently serious" threat to one of the fundamental interests  of
    society requires the decision-maker to balance the risk of future  harm
    against the need to give effect to the right of free movement.  In  any
    given case an evaluative exercise of that kind may admit of  more  than
    one answer. If so, provided that  all  appropriate  factors  have  been
    taken into account, the  decision  cannot  be  impugned  unless  it  is
    perverse or irrational, in the sense of falling outside  the  range  of
    permissible decisions."

   13. The other case is MC (Essa principles recast) [2015] UKUT 520  (IAC)
       The headnote to that decision states:

    1.   Essa rehabilitation principles are specific to decisions taken  on
    public  policy,  public  security  and  public  health  grounds   under
    regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

    2.   It is only if the personal conduct  of  the  person  concerned  is
    found to represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society  (regulation
    21(5)(c)) that it becomes relevant to consider whether the decision  is
    proportionate taking into account all the considerations identified  in
    regulation 21(5)-(6).

    3.   There is no specific reference  in  the  expulsion  provisions  of
    either  Directive  2004/38/EC  or   the   2006   EEA   Regulations   to
    rehabilitation, but it has been seen by the  Court  of  Justice  as  an
    aspect of integration, which is one  of  the  factors  referred  to  in
    Article 28(1) and regulation 21(6) ( Essa (2013) at [23]).

    4.   Rehabilitation is not an  issue  to  be  addressed  in  every  EEA
    deportation or removal decision taken under regulation 21; it will  not
    be relevant, for example, if rehabilitation has already been  completed
    ( Essa (2013) at [32]-[33]).

    5.   Reference  to  prospects  of  rehabilitation  concerns  reasonable
    prospects of a person ceasing to commit crime ( Essa (2013)  at  [35]),
    not  the  mere  possibility  of  rehabilitation.  Mere  capability   of
    rehabilitation is  not  to  be  equated  with  reasonable  prospect  of
    rehabilitation.

    6.   Where relevant (see (4) above) such prospects are a factor  to  be
    taken into  account  in  the  proportionality  assessment  required  by
    regulation 21(5) and (6) (( Dumliauskas [41]).

    7.   Such prospects are to be taken into account even if not raised  by
    the offender (Dumliauskas [52]).

    8.   Gauging such prospects requires assessing the  relative  prospects
    of rehabilitation in the host Member State as compared  with  those  in
    the Member State of origin, but, in the absence of evidence, it is  not
    to be assumed that prospects are materially  different  in  that  other
    Member State ( Dumliauskas [46], [52]-[53] and [59]).

    9.   Matters that are relevant when  examining  the  prospects  of  the
    rehabilitation of offenders include family ties  and  responsibilities,
    accommodation, education, training, employment, active membership of  a
    community and the like ( Essa (2013) at [34]). However, lack of  access
    to a Probation Officer or equivalent in the other Member  State  should
    not, in general, preclude deportation ( Dumliauskas [55])

    10.  In the absence of integration and a right of permanent  residence,
    the future prospects of  integration  cannot  be  a  weighty  factor  (
    Dumliauskas [44] and [54]). Even when such prospects  have  significant
    weight they are not a trump card, as what the Directive  and  the  2006
    EEA Regulations require is a  wide-ranging  holistic  assessment.  Both
    recognise that the more  serious  the  risk  of  reoffending,  and  the
    offences that a person may commit, the greater the right  to  interfere
    with the right of residence (Dumliauskas at [46] and [54]).

14.  As emphasised in Straszewski I am only entitled to interference in  the
judge's decision if it is vitiated by legal  error.  It  is  not  sufficient
that I disagree with the  judge  on  the  facts.  In  this  case  I  am  not
persuaded that the decision of the judge was erroneous in law.

15.  In the first  place  the  judge  heard  evidence  from  the  claimant's
partner and evaluated this together with the  documentary  evidence.  Having
done so, he found the partner to be a credible witness. Accordingly  he  was
entitled to attach  significant  weight  to  her  evidence.  This  point  is
important because the judge relied on the partner's evidence in  finding  at
[15] that the reason the claimant had not gone to the police for  help  when
the gang traced him in the UK was because he was frightened of doing so  and
in finding at [17] that "he  now  knows  the  risk  of  expulsion  he  would
continue to run if he were to offend again". At [15]  the  judge  had  found
that the evidence of the partner chimed with the remarks of  the  sentencing
judge in that it demonstrated that:

    "The [claimant] came here with his family and it is not challenged that
    he thereafter exercised Treaty rights as a worker and a  self  employed
    person as a car mechanic.  It  is  sufficiently  evident  that  he  was
    seeking to live a legitimate life here within the Regulations and a law
    abiding one. The clear inference I draw is that he would have continued
    to conduct himself and his family life in that way  but  for  the  fact
    that the gang traced him and made demands that he  pay  off  what  they
    perceived as his debt to them. One could argue that, faced  with  that,
    he should have gone to the police for help and perhaps he  was  foolish
    not to, but equally it  is  plausible,  as  his  partner  said  in  her
    evidence, that he was  frightened  of  doing  so,  perhaps  because  of
    threats made to him".

16.  Those were findings open to him and the SSHD's grounds do not  seek  to
challenge them as such.

17.  Secondly, in light of his factual findings it was clearly open  to  the
judge to assess that the claimant was not likely to re-offend. Mr  Mills  is
right to say that the judge did not directly address the  issue  of  whether
the claimant would continue to be vulnerable to the gang who had traced  him
in the UK renewing its demand that he repay his debt. At the same time,  the
judge clearly gave careful consideration to the circumstances which had  led
to claimant to offend in response to this gang's  demands  and  his  finding
that he would not re-offend clearly entailed that he was satisfied that  the
claimant would  not  respond  by  re-offending.  In  any  event,  Mr  Mill's
suggestion that the gang was likely to start  circling  the  claimant  again
was at best speculative and set against it is the  fact  that  he  had  been
back in society for some 19 months in the UK  without  any  suggestion  that
they had re-contacted him during that time, or indeed  in  Poland  where  he
has  been  since  August  2015.  If  they  knew  of  his  criminal  law  and
deportation difficulties, they would also be likely  to  know  that  the  UK
authorities had taken a close interest in the fact that a  non-UK  gang  was
involved.

18.  Thirdly, I would accept, on the authority of MC, that if the judge  had
attached significant weight to the  issue  of  the  claimant's  capacity  to
rehabilitate that would  have  been  an  error,  because  he  did  not  have
permanent residence. But  there  is  nothing  to  indicate  that  the  judge
attached any particular weight  to  the  issue  of  rehabilitation.  On  the
judge's assessment the claimant was not likely to offend because he had  not
come to the UK with the intention of offending and had only done so  because
of gang  pressure  at  a  time  when  he  had  not  appreciated  the  likely
deportation consequences. Further he had expressed evident  remorse  ([16]).
The  fact  that  his  appreciation  of  deportation  consequences  had  been
deepened by realising the  distress  his  separation  caused  his  wife  and
children was part  of  the  factual  matrix  but  not  as  such  a  specific
rehabilitative  step.  Given  those  findings,  rehabilitation  was  not   a
significant factor.

19.  For the above reasons I conclude that the  First  tier  Tribunal  judge
did not materially err in law and accordingly  his  decision  to  allow  the
claimant's appeal against the deportation order must stand.

                               Judge of the Upper Tribunal
