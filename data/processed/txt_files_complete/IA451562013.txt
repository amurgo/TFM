Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Rothwell, Counsel, instructed by BMAP
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born January 5, 1972,  is  a  citizen  of  Algeria.  The
    appellant entered the United Kingdom in 2001 and in  December  2003  he
    moved into a house with his future wife. They married  on  January  27,
    2004 but divorced on November 5, 2012. He applied on March 25, 2013 for
    a permanent right of residence under Regulation 15 of  the  Immigration
    (EEA)  Regulations  2006  but  this  application  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on October 17, 2013 as she was not satisfied  the  appellant
    had "retained rights" under Regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  Regulation  26
    of the 2006 Regulations on October 30, 2013 and on July 24, 2014  Judge
    of the First Tier Tribunal Carroll  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the
    "FtTJ") heard his appeal and in determination promulgated on August 13,
    2014 she refused his appeal on the basis he had failed to  satisfy  the
    requirements of Regulation 10(6) of the 2006 Regulations.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  on  August  22,  2014  and  on
    November 19, 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  MacDonald  gave
    permission to appeal finding there were arguable grounds that the  FtTJ
    had erred in her approach by  failing  to  consider  the  appeal  under
    Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations.

 4. The respondent filed a Rule 24  response  on  November  26,  2014.  She
    accepted that if Regulation 15 had been raised  before  the  FtTJ  then
    there was a material error.

 5. The matter came before me on the  above  date  and  on  that  date  the
    appellant was in attendance and was represented.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 6. Miss Rothwell submitted the FtTJ  erred  by  failing  to  consider  the
    appeal under Regulation 15 despite the issue being raised in  both  the
    grounds of appeal and the skeleton argument. She submitted that it  was
    clear from the case of Idezuna (EEA-permanent residence) Nigeria [2011]
    UKUT 00474 that the appellant merely had to show:

     a. Both the EEA national and the appellant had resided in  the  United
        Kingdom for a continuous period of five years.
     b. The EEA national had worked continuously for five years during  the
        period of the marriage.


    She submitted that there was evidence that the EEA national had  worked
    between 2007 and 2012 as well as 2004 to 2005 and  2006  to  2007.  The
    FtTJ materially erred and the appeal should be allowed.

 7. Mr Walker did not dispute  these  submissions.  He  accepted  that  the
    appellant had lived here with his wife since January 2004 and they were
    divorced in November 2012. Whilst they  separated  in  2008  they  both
    continued to live  here  and  the  EEA  national  had  demonstrated  an
    entitlement to permanent residence. He accepted the appellant was  also
    entitled to permanent residence as he satisfied Regulation 15(1)(b)  of
    the 2006  Regulations.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey  made  clear  in
    paragraph [2] of Idezuna that the parties did not need  to  demonstrate
    cohabitation merely that they were both present in the United Kingdom.



    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

 8. In light of the concessions made by Mr Walker I find there has been  an
    error in law. The FtTJ should have considered the appeal having  regard
    to Regulation 15 as well as Regulation 10.  Her failure to do so was an
    error. This error was material  because  the  respondent  accepted  the
    Regulation was satisfied as both the  appellant  and  his  ex-wife  had
    resided in the United Kingdom since 2004 and there was evidence of five
    years continuous work by the ex-wife during the period prior  to  their
    divorce.

 9. I therefore allow the appeal and direct that the  appellant  be  issued
    with a permanent right of residence.

Decision

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error. I set aside
    the original decision and allow the appeal under Regulation 15  of  the
    2006 Regulations.

11. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    such order was made in the First-tier and I see no reason to make  such
    an order now.
