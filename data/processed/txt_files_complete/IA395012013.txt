For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Adnan Liaquat, was born in 9 April 1985 and  is  a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant appealed against  the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State (not the Entry Clearance Officer as indicated in
    paragraph  2  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  determination)  dated   13
    September 2013 refusing his application to vary his leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant. A decision  was  also
    to made to remove him by way of directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The  appellant  appealed
    against the immigration decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Shimmin) which, in a determination promulgated  on  12  February  2014,
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now appeals, with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant had entered the United Kingdom in  September  2008  as  a
    student.  His leave to remain had been varied until 31 August 2013.  On
    24 August 2013, he had applied  to  vary  his  leave  to  remain.   The
    appellant was awarded the requisite number of points under  Appendix  A
    of the Immigration Rules save for that relating to "Previous Earnings";
     the appellant required 20 points and he was awarded 5  points.   As  a
    consequence, his application was refused.  The relevant section of  the
    refusal letter of 13 September 2013 reads as follows:

         You have claimed points for earnings of �36,323.80.

         As evidence of your previous earnings from Sunny Gifts Ltd you have
         provided Lloyds  TSB  Bank  statements,  NatWest  Bank  statements,
         dividend vouchers and wage slips.

         We are however unable to  take  into  account  �3,454.12  of  these
         earnings as shown on your wage  slips  as  this  figure  represents
         income which has been paid to you in cash, which is  considered  to
         be  unearned  income,  as  specified  under  Appendix  A   of   the
         Immigration Rules.

         We have therefore only been able to award  points  for  �25,500  of
         dividend income,  and  �3,218.80  gross  income  earned  by  wages,
         totalling �28,718.80 which we are able  to  corroborate  into  your
         bank account (sic).

         You have therefore been awarded  5  points  for  Previous  Earnings
         under Appendix A.

 3. The appellant claims that, between 15 August 2012 and 5 April 2013,  he
    received an additional sum of �7,605.00 as a director  of  Sunny  Gifts
    Ltd.  It is this part of his earnings which  is  not  accepted  by  the
    respondent because the payments had  been   made  in  cash.   (See  the
    refusal letter quoted above - "...has been paid to you in  cash,  which
    is considered to be unearned income as specified under  Appendix  A  of
    the Immigration Rules").  Judge Shimmin dealt  with  these  matters  at
    [21] - [24]:

         21.  Mr Paramor [the Presenting Officer] argues that the  following
             paragraph of the Immigration Rules is relevant:

                  '19-SD   (a)   as specified documents in  paragraph  19(a)
                      are:

                               (i)  formal pay  slips  covering  the  whole
                                   period claimed, which  must  be  on  the
                                   company  headed  paper  or  stamped  and
                                   signed as authenticated by the employer;



                               (ii) personal bank  statements  showing  the
                                   payments made to the applicant.'

             He submitted that the appellant cannot show all  his  earnings
             in the personal bank statements.

         22.  Mr Ali, for the appellant, submitted that paragraph 26 did not
             say that cash payments were excluded.  Paragraph 26  reads  as
             follows:

                  '26. Earnings do not include unearned  sources  of  income
                  such as:

                      (a)  ...

                      (b)   any  other  allowances,  and  is  part  of  the
                           applicant's remuneration package and specified in
                           the applicant's pay slips.'

             He submitted  that  paragraph  26(b)  was  not  clear  on  the
             subject.

         23.  I find  I  prefer  Mr  Paramor's  argument.   The  wording  of
             paragraph 19(a)(i) and (ii) it is  clear  that  the  appellant
             needs to produce both wage slips and personal bank  statements
             reflecting the payments in the wage slips.

         24.  I find that paragraph 26 is not relevant in the  instant  case
             as it deals with unearned sources of income.

 4. The text of paragraph 19-SD(a) (specified documents) has altered  since
    the date of the decision but the parties agreed that the  text  of  the
    paragraph provided to the Upper Tribunal by Mr Schwenk was the  correct
    text in force at the date of application and decision.  The appellant's
    argument is that he was required by  paragraph  19(a)  to  "provide  at
    least two different types of specified documents in  paragraph  19SD(a)
    from two or more separate  sources  as  evidence  for  each  source  of
    previous earnings".  He says  that  he  provided  wage  slips  (i);  an
    official tax document produced by the relevant  tax  authority  showing
    earnings on which tax has been paid or would be paid in  the  tax  year
    (iv); an accountant's letters ("if the application is  claiming  points
    for self-employed earnings.") (iv); business  bank  statements  showing
    the payments made to the application (ix).  He asserts that the  First-
    tier Tribunal and the respondent misinterpreted the  paragraph  by  (a)
    treating  cash payments made to the appellant as a  director  of  Sunny
    Gifts Ltd has "unearned income" and; (b) by requiring cash  wages  paid
    to the appellant to be  corroborated  by  entries  on  the  appellant's
    personal bank statements.

 5. With regards to this latter "requirement", there is a document at C4 of
    the bundle which has bears the heading of  the  UK  Border  Agency  and
    shows the various payments made to  the  appellant  over  the  relevant
    period. The document has two columns, one  entitled  "wage  slips  -  ?
    acceptable?" and "second form -  corroborate?".   It  is  not  entirely
    clear how this schedule came to be produced  but  both  representatives
    agreed that it emanated from the UK Border Agency and I agree  with  Mr
    Schwenk that the document seems to  indicate  that  the  UKBA  decision
    maker was seeking to corroborate cash payments made to the appellant in
    respect of his employment by reference to some other form  of  evidence
    (whether that be bank statements or otherwise).

 6. In my opinion, the form  of  paragraph  19-SD  which  applied  to  this
    appellant did not require payments shown  on  formal  pay  slips  (sub-
    paragraph  (i))  necessarily  to  be  corroborated  by  personal   bank
    statements.  The Rule makes it clear that "at least two different types
    of specified documents" should be provided; the Rule  did  not  provide
    (save in relation to  requirement  (x))  for  one  particular  form  of
    evidence to be corroborated by another  particular  form  of  evidence.
    Sub-paragraph  (x)  provides  that  "if  the   appellant   provides   a
    combination of bank statements and a letter or invoice summary from his
    accountant, he must also provide  any  invoices  generated  during  the
    period for which the earnings are being  claimed."   I  find  that  the
    appellant was simply required to provide any  two  different  types  of
    specified document not, as Judge Shimmin  found,  that  he  needed  "to
    produce both wages slips and personal bank  statements  reflecting  the
    payments in the wage slips."  The only  indication  at  all  that  that
    interpretation of the Rule may be correct is the use  of  the  definite
    article "the" sub-paragraph (ii).  However, I do not find that the  use
    of the definite article in that sub-paragraph is, in itself, sufficient
    to require an applicant to provide  both  formal  pay  slips  and  bank
    statements in respect of the same payments.  Had the Rule intended that
    requirement,  then  I  find  there  would  have  been  some  expression
    indicating  conjunction  between  sub-paragraphs  (i),  (ii)   or   the
    requirement would have been set out as in  the  form  of  sub-paragraph
    (x).

 7. Further, I find that I do agree with Judge Shimmin  (and  Mr  Ali,  who
    appeared for the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal)  in  finding
    that cash payments are not excluded by paragraph 26 (unearned  income).
    The refusal letter was, therefore, inaccurate where  it  asserted  that
    cash payments would be "considered to be unearned income, as  specified
    under Appendix A..."

 8. An issue also arises regarding the appellant's submission  of  his  tax
    return for the  year  ended  5  April  2013.   Judge  Shimmin  excluded
    consideration of that document [20] because it had not  been  submitted
    with the application and he found that he could  not,  in  consequence,
    take it into account.  However, it  is  agreed  by  the  parties  that,
    although the tax return was not submitted with the application, it  was
    submitted to the respondent before she took  the  immigration  decision
    (see Nasim and others  (Raju:  reasons  not  to  follow?)  [2013]  UKUT
    610(IAC).  In any event, I find, for the reasons given above, that  the
    appellant did provide  "at  least  two  different  types  of  specified
    documents at paragraph 19 ... SD-(a) from two or more separate  sources
    as evidence for each source of previous earnings."   Consequently,  the
    disputed sum of �7,605 should have  been  taken  into  account  in  the
    calculation of his previous earnings.  Had it been taken into  account,
    it would have carried the appellant beyond  the  threshold  of  �35,000
    required for an award of 20 points.   It  follows  that  Judge  Shimmin
    erred in law by dismissing the appellant's appeal and I set  aside  his
    determination.  In the light of my findings, I have remade the decision
    and allow the appellant's appeal against the immigration decision.





DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.   I  have  remade
the decision.  The appellant's appeal in respect of  the  Immigration  Rules
is allowed.
