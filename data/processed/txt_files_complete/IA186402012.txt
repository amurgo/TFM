                              CHRISTOPHER GREEN
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and


                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                             NOTICE AND DECISION


 1. The appellant's appeal against a deportation decision of 18 August 2012
    is before the Upper Tribunal following remittal by the Court of Appeal.
     The Upper Tribunal has already found that the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law.

 2. Pursuant to a direction of  Collins  J  sitting  as  a  Judge  of  this
    Tribunal, the Secretary of State has made a  new  deportation  decision
    against  the  appellant.   The  appellant  has  appealed  against  that
    decision.  The appeal is to be heard by the First-tier  Tribunal  under
    case number HU/06228/2017.

 3. The Secretary of State indicates a wish to withdraw her case before the
    Upper Tribunal in the present appeal, thus allowing this appeal  to  be
    disposed of without further consideration of the merits, and the  other
    appeal to be determined upon  a  full  consideration  of  all  relevant
    issues.

 4. That course of action appears to me expedient.  I accept the  Secretary
    of State's withdrawal of her case before the Upper Tribunal.   I  allow
    the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 5. The  appellant  is  nevertheless  subject  to  the  recent  deportation
    decision, his appeal against which awaits determination.
