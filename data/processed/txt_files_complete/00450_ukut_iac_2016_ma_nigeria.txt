Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)

MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) [2016] UKUT 00450(IAC)

                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

|Heard at Field House, London                 | Decision Promulgated         |
|On 01, 02, 04 & 16 August 2016               | On 16 September 2016         |

                                   Before

                  The Hon. Mr Justice McCloskey, President
                        Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul

                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

                                     MA
                         (anonymity direction MADE)
                                                                  Respondent




Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Kovats QC and Mr C Thomann, of Counsel,
                    instructed by the Government Legal Department
For the Respondent:    Mr R de Mello and Ms J Rothwell, of Counsel,
                    instructed by Oaks Solicitors

 i) The question of whether a person engaged in fraud in procuring a  TOEIC
    English  language  proficiency   qualification   will   invariably   be
    intrinsically fact sensitive.

ii) Per curiam: where the voice data generated by TOEIC testing  are  those
    of a person other than the person claiming to have undergone the tests,
    there is no breach of EU or UK data protection laws.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


Anonymity

 1) The Appellant continues to benefit from the  protection  of  anonymity.
    Accordingly, nothing will be published or communicated which identifies
    or could have the effect of identifying him.  Any infringement of  this
    prohibition could result in, inter alia, contempt proceedings.

Introduction

 2) This  is  the  judgment  of  the  panel  to  which  both  members  have
    contributed.  While this is the Secretary of State's appeal  we  shall,
    for convenience, continue to  describe  MA  as  "the  Appellant".   The
    broader landscape to which this appeal belongs can be gleaned from  the
    decisions of this Tribunal in R (Gazi) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department (ETS - Judicial Review) (IJR) [2015] UKUT 327 (IAC)  at
    [1] - [4] and SM and Qadir v SSHD (ETS - Evidence -  Burden  of  Proof)
    [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC) at [13] - [26] especially.

 3) This statutory appeal is a so-called "ETS/TOEIC" case.   "ETS"  denotes
    Educational Testing Service, a  global  corporation  based  in  the  US
    which, under contract, is one of the Home Office suppliers of so-called
    "Secure English Language Testing" ("SELT").  "TOEIC" denotes  "Test  of
    English  for  International  Communication".   This  appeal  was  heard
    together  with  two  related   judicial   review   applications,   Saha
    (JR/10845/2015) and Mohibullah (JR/2171/2015).  These three cases  were
    conjoined after the Tribunal had  identified  that  they  have  certain
    issues in common and with a view to saving costs.  A separate  judgment
    is being delivered in each of the cases.

 4) The Appellant is a national of Nigeria, aged 49 years.  He was lawfully
    present in the United Kingdom as a dependant  of  his  spouse  who  was
    granted a Tier 4 Student visa and subsequent  extensions  thereof  from
    2010 until 14 October 2014, the date of the impugned decision on behalf
    of the Secretary of State for the Home Department  (the  "Secretary  of
    State").  His is another of the cases involving  refusal  of  leave  to
    enter at port and cancellation of  entry  clearance  on  the  basis  of
    alleged deception in procuring  a  "TOEIC"  certificate,  a  recognised
    English language proficiency qualification, which he had obtained as  a
    compulsory element of his  application  for  permission  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom in the capacity of Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  Entry clearance
    for this purpose was granted to him  on  24  May  2013.   The  business
    enterprise to which it relates involved establishing a visa application
    centre, which is his business activity at an international level.

 5) The Appellant exercised his right  of  in-country  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State.  By its decision promulgated on  27
    April 2015, the First-Tier Tribunal  (the  "FtT")  concluded  that  the
    Secretary of State had not discharged the burden of  proving  deception
    and had, therefore, made a decision which was not  in  accordance  with
    the law (one of the statutory grounds of  appeal).   The  Secretary  of
    State appealed with leave  and,  by  its  decision  promulgated  on  24
    September 2015, the Upper Tribunal set aside the decision of  the  FtT.
    It did so principally on the ground that the FtT had erred  in  law  by
    failing to properly understand and  engage  with  certain  evidence.  A
    series of case management and interlocutory hearings having intervened,
    it now falls to the Upper Tribunal to remake the decision of the FtT.

 6) At the commencement  of  the  hearing,  it  became  necessary  for  the
    Tribunal to make a  preliminary  ruling  on  the  twin  issues  of  the
    permitted  grounds  of  appeal  and  the   admissibility   of   certain
    documentary evidence upon which the Secretary of State was  seeking  to
    rely.   Our ruling is attached at Appendix 1.

 7) The final prefatory matter  is  the  issue  of  dates.   The  two  most
    important dates in the factual matrix are, by some measure, 28 February
    2013 and 20 March 2013.   The  first  of  the  two  TOEIC  Certificates
    pertaining to the Appellant recites that on the first  of  these  dates
    he, having undergone the first limb of the test, secured scores of  445
    out of 495 and 410 out of 495 in the skills of  listening  and  reading
    respectively.  The second TOEIC Certificate records that  on  20  March
    2013 the Appellant secured a score of 200 out of 200 for the  skill  of
    speaking and 190 out of 200 for that of writing.  The spotlight in this
    appeal is firmly, though not exclusively, on the speaking  score  which
    he claims to have obtained.

The Secretary of State's Decision

 8) As noted above, the decision made on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
    which underlies these proceedings was made at port on 14 October  2014.
    The Appellant, having flown  from  abroad,  was  detained  at  Heathrow
    Airport  on  suspicion  of  having  engaged  in  TOEIC  fraud  and  was
    interviewed.  This resulted in a decision of the Border  Force  officer
    concerned cancelling the Appellant's leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and refusing him leave to enter under paragraph 321A(2) of  the
    Immigration Rules, which provides:

   "The following grounds for the cancellation of a person's leave to enter
         or remain which is in force on his arrival  in,  or  whilst  he  is
         outside, the United Kingdom apply: .....

         (2)  False  representations  were  made  or  false  documents  were
             submitted (whether or not  material  to  the  application  and
             whether or not to the holder's knowledge), or  material  facts
             were not disclosed, in relation to the application for  leave;
             or in order to obtain documents from the Secretary of State or
             a third party required in support of the application ....."

The error of law diagnosed in the decision of the FtT giving  rise  to  this
    remaking exercise concerned the Judge's approach to this  provision  of
    the Rules.

 9) The Secretary of State's case, in a nutshell,  is  that  the  Appellant
    procured the second of his two TOEIC Certificates by fraud.   Thus,  we
    observe, the shifting burdens of proof outlined in SM and Qadir at [57]
    - [58] are engaged.

The Issues

10) Intensive pre-hearing case management has  reduced  the  issues  to  be
    considered.  These  have   been   formulated   with   some   precision.
    Underpinning the issues is the Appellant's acceptance  that  the  voice
    contained in the computerised voice files which are said to  have  been
    generated by his TOEIC speaking  test  is  not  his.   The  Appellant's
    formulation of the issues to be addressed is the following:

      i)  Whether  his  voice  was  properly   recorded   and/or   correctly
         transferred to ETS in the United States.

     ii) Whether the voice recordings provided by ETS in  these  proceedings
         relate to the test which he took.

    iii) Whether there was a breach  of  the  Data  Protection  Act  in  the
         transmission of his data to ETS in the United States.

On behalf of the Secretary of State, it is contended that the central  issue
    to be determined by the Tribunal is whether the Appellant used a  proxy
    to undertake the speaking test.  This  effectively  encompasses  issues
    (i) and (ii).

The Expert Evidence

11) One of the beneficial effects of combining this  appeal  with  the  two
    related judicial reviews was that the expert evidence generated in each
    case was considered in the round.  One aspect of this was a pre-hearing
    meeting of the three experts and  an  ensuing  joint  memorandum  which
    demonstrated a substantial measure of agreement among them.

12) At this juncture it is appropriate to reflect  briefly  on  the  expert
    evidence.  There is evidence from three expert witnesses.  Sensibly and
    commendably, as a  result  of  a  collaborative  approach  the  experts
    produced a joint memorandum.  In addition, two of them, Mr Stanbury and
    Professor Sommer, gave evidence to the Tribunal.

13) The expertise of the three persons concerned belongs to the  fields  of
    computing,  database  programming,  computer  forensics  and   computer
    security, in general terms.  In  their  joint  memorandum  the  experts
    helpfully outline the task to which their endeavours were addressed:

   "The task of the experts was to  review  the  available  material  which
         consisted of a variety of print outs said to come  from  computers,
         handbooks  which  should  have  been  used  during   the   testing,
         testimonial evidence from the organisers of  the  events  and  from
         Home Office officials and some paper records.  There was also a BBC
         'Panorama' programme about the use of proxies and other frauds  run
         by testing centres for the benefit of attendees ......

   The issue before  the  experts  was  to  consider  the  plausibility  of
         scenarios which might explain how the ETS  computer  records  could
         reconcile the two conflicting assertions: that the audio recordings
         were created by proxies and that [the students]  actual  recordings
         were incorrectly married up in the ETS records."

[Emphasis added.]

14) In order to understand what follows it is necessary to appreciate  that
    the judicial review applicants, Mr  Mohibullah  and  Mr  Saha  and  the
    Appellant in the related case, MA, claim to have undergone their  TOEIC
    speech testing at different test centres.  These were, respectively:

      a) Mr Mohibullah: Synergy Business College.

      b) Mr Saha: Elizabeth College.

      c) Mr MA: Cauldon College.

All of these centres are located in the Greater London area.

  15) The experts,  jointly,  have  highlighted  the  following  matters  in
      particular:

   i) As regards every decision such as those under challenge in the present
      cases, "... everything  depends  on  the  policy  of  the  information
      provided by ETS to the Home Office and the ability of the Home  Office
      to match this with the data from other sources which they hold".

       ii) According to the witness statement of the Home  Office  employee
           Mr Greene, the "Lookup tool"  is  an  Excel  spreadsheet.   This
           mechanism was:

          "..  wholly  developed  within  the  Home  Office  to  enable  the
                information provided by ETS of invalid and questionable test
                results to be  checked  and  cross  referenced  against  the
                details of those who have made  applications  for  leave  to
                enter and remain .....

          A search can be made on the Lookup Tool using the ETS  Certificate
                number, the person's passport reference number or the unique
                number allocated to their record on  the  Home  Office  case
                work information and management system."

      iii) With the exception of the ETS "audit" of Synergy College,  which
           is dated 16 January 2013, none of the ETS documents bears a date
           and "...  it is not entirely clear whether they accurately refer
           to circumstances as they existed in April 2012  and  March  2013
           when the tests were taken".

       iv) There is conflicting  evidence  about  whether  the  spoken  and
           written responses of  candidates  to  individual  questions  are
           stored on individual electronic files or otherwise.

        v) One of the ETS test centre administration manuals disclosed post
           dates the periods when the TOEIC Certificates of the  Applicants
           were generated.

       vi) There is clear evidence  that  the  speaking  and  writing  test
           methodology was converted in late 2011/early  2012  from  a  web
           based system to a mobile  delivery  system.   (In  passing,  the
           Tribunal records its surprise that there is no evidence  of  the
           month, much less the specific date or dates,  when  this  rather
           important change was implemented.)

      vii) The manuals contemplate that each candidate will be photographed
           by an iPhone and/or that there will be photo registration by the
           Centre  Administrator's  personal  computer.   The   information
           provided by ETS' solicitors is  that  ETS  has  been  unable  to
           locate any photographic  records,  cannot  confirm  whether  the
           aforementioned procedure was in  operation  in  April  2012  and
           simply does not know the provenance of  the  photograph  of  the
           Appellant MA (the only member of this group of  three  litigants
           in respect of whom a photograph has been produced).

     viii) According to  ETS,  the  system  was  that  each  candidate  was
           required to register on a computer  relevant  personal  details,
           including a passport number,  which  automatically  generated  a
           computerised unique Registration Number.

       ix) The "CBT Manager application" was the computer software used  to
           record each  candidate's  spoken  and  written  responses.   The
           computerised files thereby created were then transmitted to  the
           "Online Scoring Network" at ETS' US Headquarters.

        x) There is a distinct lack of clarity relating to the  process  as
           described by ETS in (ix) above.  The description of uploading of
           the data following completion of the test is not consistent:  in
           particular, the description provided in respect of the Applicant
           Mr Mohibullah has not been put forward in either  of  the  other
           two cases.

       xi)  The  integrity  of  the  test  taking  procedures  and  systems
           established by  ETS  in  its  manuals  depends  heavily  on  the
           reliability and probity of test centre staff.  Further, the  ETS
           security precautions concentration  on  the  elicit  conduct  of
           candidates and not test centre employees.

      xii) With the sole exception of audio  files,  all  of  the  computer
           files produced have been in the form of "print-out to PDF":  the
           effect of this "...  has been not to preserve any original  date
           - and - time stamps or internal metadata either or both of which
           would have assisted analysis using digital forensic analysis and
           helped produce a chronology of events".

     xiii) The test centre seating  plans  which  have  been  produced  are
           incomplete.

      xiv) A study of the spreadsheets attached to the  witness  statements
           of the Home Office employee, Mr Sewell reveals  a  lack  of  any
           nexus between the data supplied to him by ETS and the unique  ID
           of individual candidates.  As a result, the experts say  "We  do
           not know the processes by which the candidate's name  is  linked
           to each test".

       xv) The experts acknowledge  the  documentary  evidence  of  "simple
           impersonation", with particular reference to the unannounced ETS
           audit at Synergy College on 16 January 2013.  They  express  the
           opinion  that  the  simple  impersonation  mechanism  would   be
           "vulnerable" in any speaking tests.

      xvi) While there is also some evidence of "dictated  answers",  "viz"
           answers to test questions being called out by a  person  in  the
           examination room, this method would not be viable or the  spoken
           English test.

     xvii) The investigation of a  particular  test  centre  in  Birmingham
           established the use of the "remote control  software"  mechanism
           by the use of "Team Viewer"  software  whereby  a  person  using
           another computer could secure access to the computer being  used
           by the candidate.  The  possibility  of  other,  covert,  remote
           control mechanisms is acknowledged.  There is no evidence of the
           use of any of these mechanisms in the test centres which  relate
           to these Applicants or the Appellant MA.

    xviii) The experts also advert to the possibility  of  manipulation  of
           file responses held on the local server, the CBT Manager, at the
           testing centre.  If file responses were stored on  this  server,
           this would create an opportunity for alteration by  test  centre
           staff.  Two of the experts opined that this was unlikely.

      xix) Yet another mechanism, entailing a simultaneous testing  session
           using proxies in a "hidden room" at the test centre or elsewhere
           is acknowledged.

       xx) According to the experts, "particular opportunities for mistakes
           appear to arise if the actual registration on the ETS system  is
           sometimes carried out by  test  centre  staff  and  not  by  the
           candidates themselves", creating the risk of the  data  provided
           by the test centre to ETS mis-matching the candidates and  their
           tests.  There was no security precaution  available  to  counter
           this risk, with the exception of an unannounced ETS audit.

      xxi) As none of the computers or data media associated with the  test
           centres involved in  these  cases  is  available,  there  is  no
           information relating to the important issues of audit,  log  and
           configuration files and related time and date stamps.   This  is
           one aspect giving rise to the recurring lament of the experts:

          "We have been limited by the  quantity  and  quality  of  material
                actually available to us."

     xxii) The "naming conventions" for the  digital  files  of  the  voice
           recordings produced do not provide an explicit link between  the
           candidate and the recording: rather, there is only reference  to
           the particular test  being  taken.   Contrary  to  a  suggestion
           emanating from ETS via their solicitors, the file name does  not
           include the candidate's "unique registration code".  Thus:

          "...  What this naming system does is to provide linkage between a
                registered candidate and the  responses  and  recording  but
                assumes that the unique registration code is reliably linked
                to the real candidate.  As we have already pointed  out,  in
                the two spreadsheets exhibited by Adam Sewell there  are  no
                columns uniquely to identify candidates by reference to  the
                ID they originally tendered (e.g. the passport number)."

    xxiii) Next, it is observed "The experts  have  examined  the  supplied
           audio files and find that there is no  embedded  metadata  which
           might assist their enquiries.  Time and date stamps appear to be
           of the most recent copying of the file and not of the  point  of
           origination".

     xxiv) The  experts'  consideration  of  the  report  generated  by  an
           unannounced audit of Synergy College on 15 May  2012  highlights
           that while the auditor expressed  "mild  concern",  no  specific
           remedies or sanctions vis-�-vis the college were proposed.

16) In the MA appeal, two of the experts, Mr Stanbury and Professor Sommer,
    gave evidence to the Tribunal.  Their oral  evidence  was  confined  to
    certain discrete issues and themes.  The choreography of  the  judicial
    review cases and statutory appeal  resulted  in  no  objection  to  the
    evidence particular to one case being considered in all three cases.

  17) Mr Stanbury, in his evidence, highlighted  the  following  matters  in
      particular:

      a) The absence of any evidence that the security mechanism of password
         protection vis-�-vis candidate's test computers was in operation.

      b) The "hidden room" theory could involve  the  falsification  of  the
         completed tests of both genuine and fraudulent candidates.

      c) Whereas the speaking and writing TOEIC tests, which were undertaken
         at a single session, were fully  computerised,  the  listening  and
         reading tests, also undertaken at a single session, were manual.

      d) There is no evidence of any  audit  logs.   An  "audit  log"  is  a
         computerised record which would demonstrate the chain  of  storage,
         handling, processing and transmission of the data generated by  the
         speaking and writing tests (our formulation).

      e) Metadata, if they  existed,  would  be  located  inside  the  voice
         recording files: there are none.  As a result, these files  do  not
         contain  particulars  of  the  time,  date  and  location  of   the
         recordings therein stored.

      f) Finally, Mr Stanbury's expectation  was  that  there  would  be  in
         existence  certain   contemporaneous   manual   records,   relating
         particularly to  the  names  of  candidates  and  the  desk  number
         allocated to each: there are no such records.

18) Professor Sommer further testified that the evidence fails to  disclose
    whether the important act of  uploading  the  files  generated  by  the
    speaking and writing tests  occurred  automatically  or  involved  some
    human intervention.  He agreed that if human intervention was  part  of
    this process, this would have created an opportunity  for  manipulation
    of the files, particularly if there was a time lag.  The  latter  could
    occur through, for example, a loss of  internet  connectivity,  whether
    false or genuine.  Finally, Professor Sommer focused on  the  issue  of
    photographing TOEIC test candidates.  His evidence was that  he  "never
    got  to  the  bottom"  of  this.   While  this  issue   receives   some
    consideration in the ETS test centre manuals and the witness statements
    of ETS employees, these sources  are  incomplete.   In  response  to  a
    question from the panel, Professor Sommar stated that  the  description
    of  the  Appellant  MA  in  evidence  of  group  photographs  following
    completion of the  test  exercises  bore  no  resemblance  to  what  is
    specified in the manuals.

19) At this juncture, we would observe that while the joint  memorandum  of
    the three expert witnesses and the oral testimony of two of them  have,
    inevitably, focused attention on certain discrete issues and themes, we
    have considered in their entirety the experts' reports and all  of  the
    documentary evidence bearing thereon.

The Appellant's Case

20) The Appellant's evidence takes the form of two written  statements  and
    his oral testimony to the Tribunal.  These fall  to  be  considered  in
    conjunction with a substantial quantity of documentary evidence adduced
    mainly on behalf of the Secretary of State, much of it  emanating  from
    ETS.  While we have considered  this  material  in  its  entirety,  our
    attention shall be focused on the most salient elements.

21)  We  shall  consider  first  the  issue  of  the  Appellant's   witness
    statements. The first of these is dated 26 February 2015 and  was  made
    with a view to the  forthcoming  FtT  hearing  approximately  one  week
    later.  His second  witness  statement  is  considerably  more  recent,
    bearing the date 27 June 2016.  The Appellant adopted  both  statements
    in full in his evidence to the Tribunal.

22) The Tribunal questioned the Appellant about his  first  statement.   He
    replied that this was prepared by him, at his home.  He then  forwarded
    it to his solicitor.  Next, he went  through  the  statement  with  his
    solicitor.  His  interaction  with  the  solicitor  in  finalising  the
    statement entailed several meetings and spanned a period of two  -  six
    weeks.  Ultimately, he signed the statement and it was sent with  other
    documents to the FtT.

23) The Tribunal probed this issue  with  the  Appellant  with  a  view  to
    securing as full an understanding as possible of both the  contents  of
    and the omissions in a statement made, with legal advice, by  a  person
    who is clearly intelligent and well educated and is  a  successful  and
    experienced business man.

24) Chronologically, the first main chapter in  the  Appellant's  story  is
    that of how he made arrangements to undertake the two TOEIC tests.  The
    Appellant's first witness statement contains the following passage:

   "When I decided to apply for a Tier 1 Entrepreneur  Visa,  I  approached
         Oaks  solicitors  for  assistance  in  preparing  my   Entrepreneur
         application.  Prior to making my application, I decided to  sit  my
         English Language test at ETS Global  UK  at  Cauldon  College,  2nd
         Floor, 9 City House, Cranbrooke Road, Ilford, IG1  4DU.   This  was
         because  the  English  language   requirement   was   a   mandatory
         requirement for my application.  I am very fluent and conversant in
         the English language.  I had no doubt or hesitation in passing  the
         test.  In fact, I have qualifications in  Nigeria  which  were  the
         equivalent of a Degree in the UK.  The  only  difficulty  was  that
         because I was travelling so frequently in and out  of  the  country
         for business, I did not have the time to obtain  my  qualifications
         from Nigeria to have it [sic] verified .... as being equivalent  to
         a UK Degree.  My solicitors did advise me to do this but I did  not
         have the time and so I decided to sit the English language test  in
         the UK.  In fact,  since  the  cancellation  of  my  visa  when  my
         solicitors advised me to obtain NARIC verification,  it  has  taken
         them  from  November  2014  to  February   2015   to   obtain   the
         verification.  It was a long winded procedure."

Oaks solicitors are the firm which has represented the Appellant  throughout
    the litigation process, beginning with his appeal to the FtT.

25) Oaks solicitors did not feature at all in the Appellant's  evidence  to
    the Tribunal relating to this discrete issue. Rather, his evidence  was
    that when he was applying for his entrepreneur's visa he sought  advice
    from a friend (largely unidentified,  though  the  Appellant  belatedly
    divulged a forename).  This gave rise to his friend's lawyer  "booking"
    the  test  for  him.   The  test  (singular)  arrangements  were   then
    communicated to the Appellant by  a  text  message.   Pausing  at  this
    juncture, we observe that none of this evidence is contained in  either
    of the Appellant's written statements. We have drawn attention  to  the
    use of the singular in the Appellant's descriptions of the "test" as it
    was abundantly clear to us that he was purporting to describe a single,
    isolated event in his evidence to the Tribunal.

26) When the Appellant was questioned more closely about this topic by  the
    Tribunal, his replies disclosed four noteworthy facts.  First, he  does
    not know the name of the solicitors who (he claims) made the TOEIC test
    arrangements for  him.   Second,  he  does  not  know  their  place  of
    business, though he believes it to be somewhere in East London.  Third,
    he has not communicated with these solicitors at  any  time  since  the
    tests.  Fourth, the solicitors have not levied a professional  fee  for
    their services, the Appellant has made no enquiries in this regard  and
    no payment has been made.

27) Sequentially, the next issue canvassed in some  depth  at  the  hearing
    concerned  the  test  centre  where  (per  the  first  of   the   TOEIC
    certificates) the Appellant claims to have undertaken the first of  the
    two tests, on  28  February  2013.   In  his  first,  detailed  written
    statement, the Appellant states that he underwent this test at  Cauldon
    College.  This, of course, was the listening and reading test. However,
    in his evidence to the Tribunal,  the  Appellant  gave  the  following,
    markedly different account, none of which is replicated even  obliquely
    in his witness statements.  He  claimed  that  he  was  driven  by  his
    chauffeur to Cauldon College, where he entered the reception, paid  his
    fee and was then given the address of another centre.  He was driven to
    the other centre, where he presented his identification and  registered
    using his passport.  Following this he underwent a test in a room where
    he chose his own seat, in the presence  of  an  unspecified  number  of
    others and an invigilator.  Later, he suggested that there were some 20
    candidates.  He could not recall where he was seated.  The  invigilator
    did not speak to him at any time.  No one asked for his passport.   Why
    was none of this included in the Appellant's  witness  statements?   He
    could not say.

28) It is  true  that  in  the  Appellant's  first  detailed  statement  he
    describes undergoing two separate tests on the two dates  specified  in
    the TOEIC certificates.  However, in his description of the events  and
    circumstances pertaining to the tests, he makes no distinction  between
    them.  This  extends  to  saying  nothing  whatsoever  about  different
    venues. Furthermore, his estimate of 20 candidates contrasts  with  his
    inability  to  (even)  estimate  any  number  in  his  oral  testimony,
    initially.  Nor can one reconcile his oral testimony  that  he  had  no
    recollection of where he was seated with his written evidence  that  on
    one of the test dates (unspecified), he was seated "next to a window".

29) The Appellant's  assertion  about  the  events  of  28  February  2013,
    concerning the first limb of the TOEIC test, was, inevitably, probed in
    a little detail.  The kernel of his story was that  he  was  driven  to
    Cauldon College, where he registered and paid the requisite fee and was
    redirected to  Queensway  College,  to  which  he  was  driven  by  his
    chauffeur.  At one stage  of  his  evidence  the  Appellant  was  asked
    several times by the Tribunal: to where was he  driven?   In  response,
    the best he could manage was "a different location".  He was unable  to
    identify any landmarks of any kind, the  area  in  general  terms,  the
    district or the street name.  He was unable  to  provide  any  physical
    description of the building in question or its surroundings.  He  could
    not estimate the journey time.  His explanation was that  he  was  busy
    working in the back seat of the vehicle.

30) In this  context,  it  is  appropriate  to  highlight  the  Appellant's
    evidence concerning events at Heathrow Airport on 14 October  2014  (to
    which we shall return).  The Appellant testified  that,  following  his
    detention, he telephoned his chauffeur "to find out where  he  took  me
    for the first test": the chauffeur was unable  to  tell  him  anything.
    While  we  weigh  in  the  balance  the  Appellant's  claim  that   the
    chauffeur's initial response was that he was parking the car and  would
    call back, the Appellant  gave  no  evidence  about  a  returned  call.
    Furthermore, the Tribunal heard no evidence from  the  chauffeur.  Thus
    the  incognito  of  why  parking  a  car  prevented  a   reply   to   a
    quintessentially simple questions endures.

31) The next issue concerns the tests  themselves.   In  his  main  witness
    statement, the Appellant, without any differentiation between or  among
    tests, avers that everyone was wearing ear phones.  We  readily  infer,
    fortified by the absence of any evidence  to  the  contrary,  that  ear
    phones were not  required  for  all  four  limbs  of  the  TOEIC  test.
    Specifically, we find that ear phones were not required for two of  the
    four elements, namely reading and writing.

32)  We  now  turn  to  consider  certain  documentary  evidence  and   the
    Appellant's testimony pertaining thereto.  We  preface  this  with  the
    observation that the TOEIC certificates do not record either  the  time
    or the venue of the tests purportedly taken.  The data  which  they  do
    record are the claimed candidate's name, date  of  birth,  registration
    number, date of testing, expiry date  of  certificate  (invariably  two
    years later) and the candidate's scores in  the  two  English  language
    skills tested.

33) The names of both the Appellant and Queensway College appear on certain
    official documents bearing the date 28 February 2013,  which  coincides
    with the first of the two TOEIC certificates.  The Appellant's passport
    number is recorded on two of these documents.  One of the documents  is
    a seating plan, signed by an invigilator, which allocates a total of 30
    surnames  to  individually  specified  seats  in  a   room   apparently
    containing 48 work stations.  The seat linked to the Appellant  in  the
    seating plan does not  tally  with  what  is  contained  in  a  related
    attendance list.  These materials also include  the  two-page  document
    purportedly completed by the candidate in providing the answers to  the
    listening and reading questions.  The second page purports to bear  the
    candidate's signature and the date of testing.  The  Appellant  asserts
    that the hand writing in which his signature appears is not his.

34) The Appellant testified that upon  arrival  at  Queensway  College,  he
    signed a roster of sorts at reception.  While his signature appears  on
    an attendance list containing particulars of his forename, surname  and
    identification number, coupled with an allocated seat number,  he  "did
    not think" that  this  is  what  he  signed.   He  confirmed  that  the
    identification  number  corresponded  with  his  passport  number.   He
    suggested that the signature was not in his handwriting.  He could  not
    remember anything of the invigilator's conduct.  He confirmed that  the
    test documents which he  claims  to  have  completed  and  signed  were
    comparable to the two pages containing the signature which he  disowns.
    When asked why Queensway College is not mentioned in either of his  two
    written statements, the Appellant was unable to explain.

35) We turn next to the discrete issue of photographs.  The ETS test centre
    manuals make clear that every candidate should be photographed on every
    occasion of testing and that the photographs should be taken and stored
    in a specified manner. Neither ETS  nor  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    produced any photograph of the Appellant pertaining to the  first  limb
    of the test which he claims to have undertaken at Queensway College  on
    28 February 2013. Nor does the Appellant's photograph appear in the box
    specially designated  for  this  purpose  in  the  corresponding  TOEIC
    certificate.

36)  The  Appellant's  photograph  does,  however,  appear  in  the   TOEIC
    certificate corresponding to the second (speaking and writing) limb  of
    the test,  dated  20  March  2013.   Furthermore,  precisely  the  same
    photograph was provided by  ETS's  solicitors  during  the  pre-hearing
    phase in response to requests for specified information and  documents.
    The solicitors stated:

   "It is standard practice, and a requirement, for all test takers  to  be
         photographed at the test centre on the day of the test.  A copy  of
         the photograph in respect of [the  Appellant]  is  set  out  below.
         This was a task undertaken  by  the  test  centre  not  ETS  Global
         although the information in its records shows that  the  photograph
         was taken at 11.17.17 on 20 March 2013 and uploaded at 11.21.01  on
         the same day."

The centre where TOEIC tests were taken on this  date  is  Cauldon  College.
    ETS's solicitors further assert that the test began at 10.10 hours  and
    there were 37 candidates.  On the basis that timings noted are correct,
    which was not a contentious issue, the photograph was taken 67  minutes
    later.

37) The Appellant testified that after completing the speaking and  writing
    tests  at  Cauldon  College,  the  candidates  queued  to  have   their
    photographs taken.  They lined up in groups of eight in a  gap  in  the
    middle  of  the  room.  Strikingly,  he  described  no  mechanism   for
    separating and identifying the individuals in  this  communal  fashion.
    The experts gave evidence that this  description  does  not  correspond
    remotely with the photographing procedure specified in the ETS manuals.

38) Having canvassed with  Counsel  the  specific  issue  of  the  evidence
    bearing on the  Appellant's  photographs,  on  the  final  day  of  the
    hearing, the Tribunal gave permission  for  the  adduction  of  further
    evidence on his behalf.  The evidence initially included a single  copy
    of the Appellant's passport photograph.  The Tribunal  was  anxious  to
    explore the origins of and context surrounding this discrete  evidence.
    The further witness statement (with attachments) of the Appellant  duly
    addressed this issue.  This  evidence  was  uncontentious  and,  having
    considered it, we are impelled to the view that  nothing  of  substance
    turns on the discrete issue of photographs

39) The next significant evidence to be considered concerns the  record  of
    events at Heathrow Airport on 14 October 2014.   These events, it  will
    be recalled, precipitated the decision of the Secretary of State giving
    rise to this appeal.

  40) First, there is the landing card completed  by  the  Appellant.   This
      also contains notes made by a Border Force official.   These  document
      the Appellant stating  that  he  had  undergone  an  English  language
      proficiency test for the purpose of  securing  an  Entrepreneur  visa.
      The record continues:

         "[He] had to ring home to get details of his test date and place
         ....  [and] .... provided name of the test centre as Claudon
         College in 3/2013."

It is convenient to interpose here the Appellant's evidence to the  Tribunal
    concerning this issue.  The Appellant testified  that  his  driver  was
    waiting to collect him at Heathrow Airport.  He telephoned  the  driver
    for the purpose of ascertaining where he had taken the test (singular).
     The driver was unable to provide him with this information, but stated
    that he would have to park the car and would then call  the  Appellant.
    According to the Appellant, he then remembered the text that  had  been
    sent to him by  his  friend  Ahmed.   He  produced  this  text  to  the
    Tribunal.  It is dated 19  March  2013  and  timed  14.26  hours.   Its
    contents consist of the name Cauldon College and its address, including
    the  postcode.   The  Appellant  did  not  provide   any   satisfactory
    explanation of why, on 19 March 2013, he needed this information having
    regard to his claim that he had been to Cauldon College and  had  spent
    some time there just three weeks previously.

41) The second document generated by  events  at  Heathrow  Airport  on  14
    October 2014 is the record of the Appellant's interview.  According  to
    this  he  confirmed  that  he  was  "fit  and  well  and  happy  to  be
    interviewed".  The interview had a recorded  duration  of  10  minutes.
    When asked about his English language proficiency test,  the  Appellant
    is recorded as having replied:

   "I think March 2013 ...  in Ilford, Cauldon College."

The next question and answer were:

   "Which English language test did you sit? ......

     [Answer] I can't remember."

The Appellant's evidence to the Tribunal was  that  this  question  was  not
    clear and he did not understand it.  This question was followed by:

   "What did the test consist of? ......

         [Answer] Writing, listening and speaking."

The Appellant was asked in  cross  examination  why  he  had  not  mentioned
    reading.  He replied "I don't know".

Next, he was unable to state the amount he had paid in  order  to  undertake
    the test.  We contrast this with  the  fact  that  that  in  his  first
    written statement, made four months later, he stated "I believe I  paid
    approximately �200 for the test".

  42) The ensuing question and answer were:

   "How many people were there when you sat the English test? ....

         [Answer] Full, in my room there were around 20 people."

At the hearing the Appellant was asked to indicate which  of  the  two  test
    centres to which this answer applied: he replied  "I  can't  remember".
    As the interview  progressed,  he  asserted  that  the  test  (notably,
    singular) lasted roughly one hour and  was  undertaken  at  a  computer
    terminal, after he had provided his passport.  He added "They took  our
    photo".  His answers made no mention of Queensway College and contained
    no suggestion of two separate testing exercises.

The Main Factual Issues: Findings And Conclusions

43) We are conscious that the only TOEIC invalidated is the second one and,
    further, that the impugned  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    founded on the speaking element of the  second  certificate.   However,
    given the run of the hearing we consider that the main factual issue to
    be determined by the Tribunal in this appeal is whether  the  Appellant
    underwent the four English language proficiency tests on  the  separate
    dates and occasions to which the two  TOEIC  certificates  relate.   We
    deduce from the submissions of both parties' counsel that there  is  no
    disagreement about this approach.  The  discrete  factual  issues  upon
    which we have focused  above  are  those  which  emerged  as  the  most
    important during the hearing and received most attention.  All of  them
    have a bearing, directly or indirectly, on the central issue.

44) We remind ourselves of the correct approach to the issue of  burden  of
    proof and, in particular, the "burden of proof boomerang" discussed  in
    Muhandiramge (Section S-LTR.1.7) [2015] UKUT  00675  (IAC),  at  [9]  -
    [11].  In SM and Qadir this Tribunal, at [91], described the  Secretary
    of  State's  case  against  both  Appellants   as   "non-specific   and
    generalised".  This contrasts with the  present  appeal  in  which  the
    production of a markedly greater volume of evidence, both  general  and
    specific, has contributed significantly to the presentation of  a  more
    focused and considerably more substantial case against  the  Appellant.
    At the general level, there is, inter alia, clear prima facie  evidence
    of TOEIC corruption at the two test centres where the Appellant  claims
    to have been examined.  At the specific level, one  has  in  particular
    the TOEIC certificates  and  the  documentary  records  linked  to  the
    Appellant in respect of the date and place  where  he  claims  to  have
    undergone the second part of the test, namely 20 March 2013 at  Cauldon
    College.  The specific evidence also includes the records of the events
    at Heathrow Airport on 14 October 2014.

  45) In SM and Qadir, the following was stated by this Tribunal, at [102]:

   "We take this opportunity to re-emphasise that every case  belonging  to
         the ETS/TOEIC stable will invariably be fact sensitive.  To this we
         add that every appeal will  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the
         evidence adduced by the parties."

This is echoed in the statement of Beatson LJ in Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department v Shehzad and Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615, at [23]:

   "I do not address the question of what evidence will  be  sufficient  to
         enable a Tribunal to conclude that there  has  been  no  deception.
         That is likely to be an intensely fact-specific matter."

We draw attention to two further statements in SM  and  Qadir.   First,  the
    tentative prediction in [103]:

   "We take note of the indications in the conduct of these  appeals  that,
         in some future case, the Secretary of  State  may  seek  to  adduce
         further evidence, likely to be expert in nature."

This type of "entirely new  ingredient"  has  materialised  in  these  three
    conjoined cases, in the shape of three experts' reports. Finally,  this
    Tribunal stated at [80]:

   "In some of the FtT decisions  in  this  field  one  finds  observations
         concerning the appellant's apparent fluency in, and command of, the
         English language. We consider that Judges  should  be  cautious  in
         adopting this approach for at least three reasons.   The  first  is
         the passage of time. The second is that  Judges  are  not  language
         testing or linguistics experts.  The third is that, to date,  there
         has been no expert linguistic evidence in any of these cases."

46) We have considered what Beatson LJ said regarding the issue  of  burden
    of proof in Shehzad and Chowdhury, at [30].

   ".....  In circumstances where the generic evidence is  not  accompanied
         by evidence showing that the individual under  considerations  test
         was categorised as 'invalid', I  consider  that  the  Secretary  of
         State faces a difficulty in respect of the evidential burden at the
         initial stage."

We observe that this evidential frailty does not arise in the present  case.
    In this context, we have given consideration to one  particular  issue.
    While we infer that the action taken against the  Appellant  by  Border
    Force officials at Heathrow  Airport  must  have  been  based  on  some
    information capable of being  reproduced  in  documentary  form  and/or
    detailed in a witness statement, there is no such evidence  before  us.
    Thus there is a gap in the Secretary of State's case in  this  respect.
    This discrete issue did not form part  of  the  Appellant's  case  and,
    while mindful that this is not  determinative,  we  consider  that  the
    effect of this lacuna is neutral in the context of the present appeal.

47) We must also balance the expert evidence, summarised  in  [11]  -  [18]
    above.  This evidence highlights that  there  are  enduring  unanswered
    questions  and  uncertainties  relating  in  particular   to   systems,
    processes and procedures concerning the TOEIC testing,  the  subsequent
    allocation of scores and the  later  conduct  and  activities  of  ETS.
    While we bear this evidence in mind, ultimately it was  largely  remote
    from the centre of the Appellant's case.

48) We have identified in [20] - [42] above those factual issues which,  as
    the  hearing  progressed,  emerged  as  the  most   significant.    Our
    exposition of them has been  interspersed  with  certain  comments  and
    asides, which we  do  not  repeat.   We  make  the  following  discrete
    findings, some of which are self-explanatory:

      i) There are significant gaps in the  Appellant's  witness  statements
         and,  related  to  this,  notable   discrepancies   between   these
         statements and his evidence to the Tribunal. This is what  prompted
         the Tribunal's  exploration  of  the  circumstances  in  which  the
         statements were compiled. The Appellant has failed to  provide  any
         satisfactory explanation of the gaps and discrepancies.

     ii) The Appellant's abject failure  to  provide  even  the  most  basic
         description of the car journey which he claims to  have  undertaken
         from Cauldon College to Queensway College or any  physical  feature
         of the latter college or its surroundings significantly  undermines
         his account of events on 28 February 2013, the date  of  his  first
         TOEIC certificate.  There is no documentary evidence supporting the
         Appellant's account of events, even obliquely and no  evidence  was
         adduced from  two  potentially  supporting  witnesses,  namely  the
         Appellant's chauffeur and  the  (unidentified)  solicitor  who,  he
         claims, made the test arrangements for him. We find his  vague  and
         hesitant account of events on  this  date  wholly  implausible.  We
         conclude that this evidence was fabricated in its entirety.

    iii) The Appellant sought to distance himself from  the  contemporaneous
         records apparently relating to test taking at Queensway College  on
         28 February 2013. We find, on  balance,  that  these  records  were
         generated on the date and occasion specified.  The Appellant gave a
         description of his seat which does not accord with  either  of  the
         records.  He asserted that the signatures purporting to be  his  in
         the attendance sheet and on the second  page  of  the  reading  and
         listening test itself were not made by him and do not  reflect  his
         handwriting.  We accept his claim in this respect. We consider that
         he was  driven  to  acknowledge  this  on  the  ground  that  these
         signatures could not withstand comparison  with  his  signature  on
         other documents, for example his two witness statements.   However,
         these are the only documents relating to the  Appellant,  Queensway
         College and the date in question.  There was no suggestion from any
         quarter  that  other  comparable  documents  containing  his   true
         signature must exist but have not,  for  some  unexplained  reason,
         been disclosed by either  ETS  or  the  Secretary  of  State.   The
         explanation for all of this, we readily find, is that the Appellant
         did not attend Queensway College on the date claimed  and  did  not
         undertake either of the tests in question.  It  follows  from  this
         that what is represented in the first of the TOEIC certificates  is
         wholly false.

     iv) While we take into  account  Mr  De  Mello's  submission  that  the
         Secretary of State's deception case against the  Appellant  relates
         to the second, and not the first, test, this does not  preclude  us
         from, firstly, considering the evidence relating to the first test,
         particularly  as  it  bears  directly  on  the  Appellant's  credit
         generally and,  secondly,  making  appropriate  findings  of  fact.
         Taking into account also the other unsatisfactory and  unpersuasive
         aspects of the Appellant's evidence, we find specifically that  the
         TOEIC certificate dated 28 February 2013 is not the product of  any
         test undertaken on that date on this date and occasion or at all.

      v) This finding is reinforced by the absence of a  photograph  on  the
         first of the two TOEIC certificates. It is further  reinforced  by,
         inter alia, (a)  the  Appellant's  consistent  description  in  his
         witness statements of having attended one test centre only,  namely
         Cauldon College, (b) his consistent description of  a  single  test
         occasion when interviewed at Heathrow Airport, (c) his  failure  to
         mention Queensway College in the span of two witness statements and
         (d) his mentioning of Queensway College for the first time when  he
         gave evidence to the Tribunal.  Under questioning, he was unable to
         account for his failure to do so in any  of  the  earlier  contexts
         detailed.

     vi) There are self-evident gaps and discrepancies in the account  which
         the Appellant gave to Border Force  officers  at  Heathrow  Airport
         (see [39] above).  We bear in mind the Appellant's  explanation  to
         the Tribunal for  these  shortcomings,  which  was  that  he  found
         himself in a situation of detention without advance warning and was
         feeling stressed.  However, we must balance this with the following
         facts and factors: the Appellant did not make this claim in  either
         of this witness  statements;  in  his  main  witness  statement  he
         claimed that he "told them everything"; he was able to  communicate
         by phone with his chauffeur and  the  immigration  attach�  of  the
         Nigerian High Commissioner in  London;  and  he  signified  at  the
         outset of the interview that he was "fit and well and happy  to  be
         interviewed".

    vii) We are prepared to accept that the Appellant  found  himself  in  a
         stressful situation at the airport.  On the other hand, in addition
         to the matters  highlighted  immediately  above,  there  was  every
         incentive and opportunity  for  this  intelligent  and  experienced
         business man, in a context where there was no language barrier,  to
         make fully and candidly his  case  in  respect  of  the  two  TOEIC
         certificates,  both  reactively  and  proactively.   He  manifestly
         failed to do so and his claim that he  "told  them  everything"  is
         demonstrably unsustainable.   We  do  not  accept  the  Appellant's
         explanation for the gaps  and  discrepancies  identifiable  in  the
         Heathrow  records.   We  consider  that  these  count  against  his
         credibility.

   viii) We have considered with particular care the Appellant's account  of
         events at Cauldon College on the second of the two material  dates,
         20 March 2013.  We acknowledge that his photograph appears  on  the
         TOEIC certificate linked to this occasion and, further,  that  this
         photograph tallies precisely with that  produced  via  third  party
         disclosure by ETS.  It is common case that these  two  photographic
         representations depict the Appellant. We find that this  photograph
         was created at Cauldon College on 20 March 2013.

     ix) On the balance of probabilities, the Appellant, therefore, attended
         Cauldon College on the date to which the second  TOEIC  certificate
         relates.   While there are apparently  contemporaneous  records  of
         events at Queensway College dated 28 February 2013,  there  are  no
         corresponding records relating to Cauldon College on 20 March 2013.
          This is unexplained from all quarters.  We consider that there  is
         no consequential inference adverse  or  positive  to  either  party
         which can reliably be made.

      x) In this context we refer also to the "CD properties  screen  shots"
         said to relate to the CD containing the Appellant's  voice.   These
         appear to have emanated from the Secretary of State via pre-hearing
         disclosure.  The  references  to  the  "documents"  are   a   clear
         indication that these documents were generated in the course of and
         for the purpose of these appeal  proceedings.  We  note  that  they
         contain the Appellant's registration number  and  his  surname.  We
         have  also  considered  the  dates  that  are  visible.   The  most
         significant feature of this  evidence  is  that  it  is  not  self-
         explanatory  (quite  the   opposite)   and   is   unexplained   and
         unilluminated, particularly in the absence of  a  suitable  witness
         statement.  We conclude that this evidence  does  not  advance  the
         Secretary of State's case.

49) While the evidential foundation  of  our  main  finding  of  fact  that
    neither of the TOEIC certificates is the product of tests undertaken by
    the Appellant is already substantial, still  further  reinforcement  is
    found in other parts of the evidence.  First, there is the unchallenged
    evidence on behalf of the Secretary of State arising out of analysis of
    all candidates' scores related  to  the  listening  and  reading  tests
    undertaken at Queensway College on 28 February 2013.  The  majority  of
    the results lie within a very narrow band, with a score  range  in  the
    middle of the  B2  level.   The  report  of  the  Intelligence  Analyst
    concerned states:

   "This pattern is not consistent with genuine candidates  at  other  SELT
         providers.  This patterns is consistent with other ETS  TOEIC  test
         centres where results were manipulated and reported incorrectly  by
         test centre staff ....."

The  author  characterises   the   scoring   patterns   as   "abnormal   and
    statistically improbable", contrasting them with the  scoring  patterns
    of test centres not  belonging  to  the  suspect  category.   The  same
    assessment is made in respect of the scoring patterns in  speaking  and
    writing tests at Cauldon College.   It  is  also  noteworthy  that  the
    Appellant's TOEIC certificates belong to what may be described  as  the
    peak period of cheating and manipulation in the ETS/TOEIC saga.

50) In contrast with other cases there is cogent evidence  in  this  appeal
    explaining the "lookup tool".  The evidence is that this consists of an
    Excel spreadsheet which has the capacity to search a list of  thousands
    of test certificates provided by ETS with  a  view  to  connecting  the
    certificates with persons who have made applications for leave to enter
    and remain.  This  mechanism  was  wholly  developed  within  the  Home
    Office.  The data used for this purpose are the name, date of birth and
    nationality of the person identified in the TOEIC certificate, combined
    with the certificate number and the person's passport reference  number
    or Home Office unique number.

51) In this Appellant's case, the use  of  this  tool  generated  an  Excel
    spreadsheet, included in the evidence, in familiar form relating to the
    second of the TOEIC certificates. This contains the ETS  assessment  of
    the scores recorded as "invalid".   While  we  take  into  account  the
    questions and doubts expressed by the experts these focus more  on  the
    ETS and test centre methodologies than the ETS mechanisms and processes
    for the analysis of the computerised  files  holding  suspect  speaking
    tests. We record further that there was no frontal  challenge  to  this
    particular  piece  of  evidence.  The  "invalid"  assessment  is   also
    supported by our findings above.  Overall  we  are  satisfied  that  we
    should treat the "invalid" assessment as reliable.

52) The arguments of Mr De Mello and Ms Rothwell, inter alia, focussed on a
    letter from  ETS  responding  to  a  request  for  information  by  the
    Appellant's solicitors.  The context and  import  of  this  letter  are
    illuminated by the evidence that there were 37  candidates  purportedly
    taking the speaking and writing tests at Cauldon College  on  20  March
    2013.  The outcome of the ETS assessment was that none  of  the  scores
    contained in the related TOEIC  certificates  was  considered  free  of
    suspicion.  The Appellant was one of 31 candidates  whose  scores  were
    assessed  as  "invalid".    The  assessment  of   the   remaining   six
    candidates' scores was "questionable".

53) The aforementioned letter from ETS, unsurprisingly, deals only with the
    Appellant's case and the cancellation of his scores.  It is clear  that
    this does not extend to phase one of  the  tests,  namely  the  earlier
    listening and reading modules. Nor, in our judgment, was it designed or
    intended to do so.  We discern no inconsistency between the ETS  letter
    and the detailed report of  the  Home  Office  employee  on  which  the
    evidence summarised in  [48]  above  is  based.  We  note  further  the
    evidence, which we accept, that the specific reason for  the  "invalid"
    assessment in this Appellant's case was that analysis of a batch of 280
    speaking tests from Cauldon College spanning the period 27 February  to
    30 March 2013 revealed that the voice purporting  to  be  that  of  the
    Appellant was the same as the voice analysed  in  at  least  one  other
    component of the batch. It is convenient to recall,  in  this  context,
    that the voice recorded in the speaking and listening tests  attributed
    to him is not his.

54) At this juncture we switch our focus to the Appellant's evidence to the
    Tribunal.  We heard and observed the Appellant studiously during some 2
    � hours.  We scrutinised  in  particular  response  times,  hesitation,
    spontaneity and engagement with the Tribunal generally.  We  found  the
    Appellant surprisingly hesitant.  If he had truly undertaken the  tests
    we would have expected him to have been much more assured and assertive
    in his evidence.  These qualities were,  however,  strikingly  lacking.
    We would also have expected greater spontaneity in  his  evidence.   In
    particular, we consider that, if genuine, he would have been anxious to
    disclose, spontaneously or otherwise, matters of detail relating to the
    two days and occasions under scrutiny with a view to demonstrating  his
    innocence of the charge of deception.  This too was  strikingly  absent
    from  his  evidence.   Furthermore,  on  occasions,  the  simplest   of
    questions had to be repeated, sometimes  more  than  once,  a  paradigm
    illustration being the quintessentially simple, but crucial,  question:
    to where did he travel from Cauldon College on the first  occasion,  28
    February 2013?  The Appellant dealt with this repeated  question  in  a
    wholly unsatisfactory way.

55) These features of  the  Appellant's  demeanour,  presentation  and  the
    delivery of his evidence generally  must  be  considered  within  their
    contextual framework  and,  in  particular,  the  background  that  the
    Appellant, prior to giving evidence to the Tribunal, had enjoyed  ample
    time for reflection, recollection and preparation.  We recognise that a
    party or witness whose evidence partakes of  these  characteristics  is
    not, ipso facto and inexorably, unworthy of belief.   However,  context
    is everything and we consider that  in  this  particular  appeal  these
    factors, coupled  with  the  findings  and  considerations  highlighted
    above, impel ineluctably to the conclusion that the Appellant's case is
    a fabrication in all  material  respects.   Finally,  we  have  already
    highlighted above, and do not repeat, his unconvincing and  implausible
    explanations of material discrepancies  and  inconsistencies  canvassed
    with him in questioning.

Omnibus Finding and Conclusions

56) We make two concluding observations. First, we are conscious  that  our
    assessment of the Appellant's credibility differs radically  from  that
    of the FtT.  While we take this into account,  we  are  not  of  course
    bound by another judicial assessment.  Furthermore, it  is  clear  that
    the content and contours of the appeal which we have considered  differ
    markedly from those of the first instance appeal.

57) Second, we acknowledge the suggestion that the Appellant had no  reason
    to engage in the deception which we have found proven.   However,  this
    has not deflected us in any way from reaching  our  main  findings  and
    conclusions.  In the abstract, of course, there is a range  of  reasons
    why persons proficient in English may engage  in  TOEIC  fraud.   These
    include, inexhaustively, lack of confidence, fear of failure,  lack  of
    time and commitment and contempt for  the  immigration  system.   These
    reasons could conceivably overlap in  individual  cases  and  there  is
    scope for other explanations for deceitful conduct in this sphere.   We
    are not required to make the  further  finding  of  why  the  Appellant
    engaged in deception and to  this  we  add  that  this  issue  was  not
    explored during the hearing.  We resist  any  temptation  to  speculate
    about this discrete matter.

58) Our overarching finding is that the testing and scores to which the two
    TOEIC certificates relate are not  the  product  of  any  corresponding
    English language proficiency  tests  undertaken  by  the  Appellant  on
    either of the occasions in question or  on  any  other  occasion.   The
    Appellant's claims to the contrary are demonstrably  false.   They  are
    wholly unworthy of belief in every  material  respect.   We  make  this
    overarching finding on the  grounds  and  for  the  reasons  elaborated
    above.

59) This finding is dispositive of all issues in the  appeal.   Bearing  in
    mind the legal issue of the burden of proof, it follows inexorably from
    this finding that we are satisfied that  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    discharged the evidential burden of  establishing  that  the  Appellant
    procured his TOEIC certificates by deception.  The Appellant,  for  the
    reasons  explained,  has  manifestly  failed  to  raise   an   innocent
    explanation of any  element  of  the  prima  facie  case  of  deception
    established against him.  It follows that there is no further  transfer
    of proof to the Secretary of State. We make  clear  that  there  is  no
    hesitation in our overarching finding.  In our  judgment  the  evidence
    points persuasively and decisively to this conclusion.

60) It follows that the first and second of the issues formulated on behalf
    of the Appellant - see [10] above - do not arise. They are extinguished
    by our principal finding that the Appellant did not  undertake  any  of
    the tests to which the TOEIC certificates relate.  This finding is also
    dispositive of the third of the Appellant's issues, since there was  no
    transmission of any of his data  to  ETS  headquarters  in  the  United
    States.

61) Notwithstanding,  we  shall  record  briefly  our  views  on  the  data
    protection issue.  The interlocking elements of this argument are  that
    the Appellant's voice constitutes personal data; the recording  of  his
    voice represents the processing of such data; the processor was Cauldon
    College; ETS and the Secretary of State are the data controllers or ETS
    is the Secretary of State's agent in this respect; and the  Appellant's
    personal data  were  transferred  to  the  United  States  without  his
    knowledge and consent.  The central pillar of the argument  appears  to
    be that the college processed the Appellant's personal data  unlawfully
    by engaging a proxy test taker without his consent or  knowledge.   The
    effect of our principal finding above is that a proxy  test  taker  was
    indeed employed. However, this did not occur  without  the  Appellant's
    consent or knowledge: on the contrary,  he  connived  actively  in  the
    fraud. The argument founders accordingly.

62) On the hypothesis  that  the  essential  factual  ingredients  in  this
    argument had been established, the question of  the  liability  of  the
    data controller (the Secretary of State) for the breach of data law  by
    the data processor (Cauldon College)  under  Article  17  of  Directive
    95/46/EC would have arisen.  Equally the Tribunal  might  have  had  to
    explore the  related  question  of  the  transfer  of  the  Appellant's
    personal data  to  the  United  States  in  breach  of  the  safeguards
    enshrined in Article 25.  However, assuming the determination of all of
    the factual  and  legal  issues  in  the  Appellant's  favour  in  this
    hypothetical scenario, it is far  from  clear  that  the  consequential
    illegality asserted, namely a breach of the  Appellant's  rights  under
    Article 8 ECHR and Articles 8 and 2 of the EU  Charter  of  Fundamental
    Rights would have been demonstrated. Inter  alia,  given  the  admitted
    fact of a proxy test taker it is difficult to see how  the  voice  data
    can conceivably be described as the  Appellant's.  We  decline  to  say
    anything more on this subject.

Decision and Disposal

63) We reverse the decision of the FtT and allow the Secretary  of  State's
    appeal, thereby affirming the underlying decision of the  Secretary  of
    State, dated 14 October 2014, to cancel the Appellant's leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom.





                                                                       [pic]
                                               THE HON. MR JUSTICE MCCLOSKEY
                                             PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER

                                                     Date: 02 September 2016
                          APPENDIX  1.  Ruling No 1





 1) There are three preliminary issues requiring  our  consideration.   The
    first relates to the scope of the appeal.  As Mr Kovats QC has candidly
    acknowledged, this is determined decisively by the terms  of  paragraph
    44 of the decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Monson. In very brief
    compass indeed, the issue under paragraph 321A(2) of the Rules was  the
    subject of the Judge's finding that a material error of  law  had  been
    established.   In  contrast,  the  Judge  unequivocally  affirmed   the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal on the issue relating to  paragraph
    321A(1) of the Rules.  The ineluctable consequence of that is that only
    the first of these issues is live at this remaking stage.

 2) The second issue concerns the documents that are found in Section E  of
    the Appellant MA's bundle.   Without  conducting  a  disproportionately
    lengthy tracing exercise two things are reasonably apparent.  The first
    is that their genesis can be traced to paragraph 45 of the decision  of
    Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Monson.   The  second  is  that  in  the
    profusion of correspondence which has characterised the last few months
    of these proceedings further documents have been provided and some  may
    not be easily attributed to specific categories or issues.

 3) We must bear in mind that we are a tribunal in which  the  conventional
    rules of evidence of  civil  proceedings  are  not  applied  with  full
    rigour.  The first question for us is  whether  these  documents  might
    have a bearing on the issues.  We will be unable to provide a concluded
    answer to that until all of the evidence and arguments  are  completed.
    However, we can provide a  provisional  answer  which  is  affirmative.
    This assessment can if necessary be revisited and reopened if there are
    proper grounds for doing so at a later stage of the hearing.   If  this
    discrete ruling stands then the conventional consequence  will  follow,
    namely that the main issue for the Tribunal will be the weight, if any,
    to be attached to the documents in question.

 4) We bear in mind also that the documents under scrutiny have been in the
    possession of the Appellant MA's legal representatives for  some  time,
    albeit not in satisfactory form as regards some of them and  we  deduce
    from Mr De Mello's submissions that there is no element  of  ambush  or
    surprise and he will be able to deal with the documents by examination-
    in-chief  of  the  Appellant.   Accordingly  there  is  no   issue   of
    unfairness.

 5) We propose to adopt precisely the same approach to the  final  document
    to which our attention has been drawn on behalf of the Appellant.  This
    is a new document in the context of these appeal proceedings: the  data
    transfer agreement, the parties whereto, we note, are ETS Global on the
    one hand and ETS on the other.

 6) We are cognisant of the Secretary of State's submission in relation  to
    the data issue, having been alerted to it on  more  than  one  occasion
    previously and having considered  the  Secretary  of  State's  skeleton
    argument.  Nonetheless we shall admit this document on the ground  that
    it is of potential relevance to  one  of  the  Appellant's  grounds  of
    appeal and shall in due course  rule  in  our  final  decision  on  its
    relevance and, if it is accorded any degree of  relevance,  the  weight
    and significance, if any, which flow therefrom.







                           APPENDIX 2. Ruling No 2




Having considered all documents lodged by the parties and having  heard  the
parties' respective representatives, Mr N Armstrong, of Counsel,  instructed
by Bindmanns Solicitors, on behalf of the Applicants and Mr S Kovats QC,  of
Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department,  on  behalf  of  the
Respondent, at a hearing at Field House, London on 02 August 2016.

 1) As we have observed at a number of stages of these proceedings  and  in
    particular in the reserved interlocutory order which was promulgated on
    17 July 2016 there has been much pre-trial activity in  these  combined
    proceedings.  Today's has as its main focus the issue of disclosure  of
    documents from both the Secretary of State and also ETS, the interested
    party whose activities form an important part of the actual framework.

64) At this stage of the combined hearing, namely at the beginning  of  the
    hearing of the  two  conjoined  judicial  review  applications  we  are
    required to rule on a discrete issue relating to the reception of  oral
    evidence.

65) The origins of this issue can be traced to  the  order  of  Mr  Justice
    Green in the High Court dated 21  March  2016.   His  Lordship  ordered
    inter alia in paragraph 3 that the parties shall prepare for the  final
    hearing on the basis that  there  will  be  oral  evidence  and  cross-
    examination of the  applicant,  Hermanis  Gardner,  Roxanna  Crann  and
    Bernard Everdince but it should be a matter for the trial Judge whether
    such oral evidence is required.

66) This very wise and pragmatic order has had the consequence that we  are
    in a position to deal with  the  question  of  the  reception  of  oral
    evidence  without  any  unwelcome  obstruction  of  or  delay  in   the
    transaction of this hearing.

67) The reception of oral evidence in  judicial  review  is  undoubtedly  a
    comparatively unusual occurrence just as an application for  permission
    to cross-examine any party or witness equally is.  These are,  however,
    unusual proceedings.  Furthermore, as a matter of general principle  it
    may be said that in the  contemporary  world  of  judicial  review  the
    reception of oral evidence and the phenomenon of cross-examination  are
    likely to be approached a little more flexibly  than  they  would  have
    been during a previous era.

68) Hence when it is stated by the Divisional Court in the case  of  Harris
    at page 596 to 597 that  the  principles  for  the  reception  of  oral
    evidence in judicial review are the following, and the relevant passage
    then ensues, one is likely  to  construe  that  passage  as  rehearsing
    applicable  principles  which  were  not  necessarily  intended  to  be
    exhaustive nor indeed have that effect.

69) We have considered the written submission of Mr Armstrong on behalf  of
    the applicant Mohammad Mohibullah and the very helpful response  of  Mr
    Kovats on  behalf  of  the  Respondent.   These  challenges  have  been
    organic.  The organic dimension of the proceedings may not yet be at  a
    conclusion and we are particularly conscious that this  is  the  second
    set of combined hearings which are  likely  to  have  an  impact  on  a
    substantial quantity of other cases.

70) Adopting that approach and bearing in mind that without the  aid  of  a
    crystal ball we cannot hope to predict precisely the course  which  the
    admission of oral evidence is likely to take.  We propose to accede  to
    the application.  We shall not do so in rigid terms but any  particular
    type of evidence adduced will be received  de  bene  esse.   Ultimately
    that might well prove to be the correct approach.   However,  we  shall
    receive the evidence and in the unusual way shall then decide following
    such argument as may  be  received  what  weight  should  properly  and
    rationally be attached to it.

71) We must make abundantly clear that as in previous instances where  oral
    evidence has been adduced in the forum of judicial review it will  have
    a very narrow focus.  Witnesses will not be giving  evidence  at  large
    and in an open-ended manner and  we  shall  identify  clearly  with  Mr
    Armstrong in  advance  of  each  witness  the  proposed  scope  of  any
    examination-in-chief.










                           APPENDIX 3. Ruling No 3


 1) We determine these two interlocutory  matters  in  the  following  way.
    First there is an application on behalf of  the  Respondent  to  adduce
    further evidence.  The further evidence takes  the  form  of  a  second
    witness statement of one of the Respondent's deponents, namely Mr James
    Turner.  It is represented to the Tribunal by Mr Kovats  QC  that  this
    further evidence is designed to establish as a fact that Mr  Mohibullah
    has attended a number of  educational  establishments  during  previous
    years which have been the subject of inter alia licence revocation.  We
    refuse this application for the following reasons.

 2) First of all, if this evidence had been relevant it would have  had  to
    form part of the Secretary of State's response ideally  initially  and,
    at the latest, during the subsequent phase of the  proceedings  in  the
    discharge of the Secretary of State's duty of candour.  Secondly, there
    is absolutely no evidence before us that this new  evidence  was  taken
    into account by the decision-maker.  Thirdly, this new evidence has not
    been put to the applicant Mr Mohibullah.  One could of course devise  a
    mechanism for dealing with that problem.  The difficulty with  that  is
    that the disruption and delay  which  that  would  inevitably  generate
    would be disproportionate.  For that combination of reasons  we  refuse
    the application.

 3) Second, we rule on the Respondent's objection to the witness  statement
    of Miss Patel, the  Applicant's  legal  representative.   Miss  Patel's
    witness statement is dated 26 July 2016.  She is  a  paralegal  in  the
    firm of solicitors  representing  the  applicant  Mr  Mohibullah.   Her
    witness statement contains certain averments relating to the layout  of
    a room in  premises  which  are  of  relevance  to  these  proceedings.
    Objection is taken on the grounds  that  this  purports  to  be  expert
    evidence and has not been adduced in accordance with  the  requirements
    of evidence of this species.

 4) Having reflected on this we acknowledge that the  issue  to  which  the
    witness statement is addressed is a relevant issue in the  proceedings,
    though its full importance cannot be measured  at  present.   Next,  we
    note that the author  of  the  witness  statement  does  not  have  the
    expertise of an architect or engineer or someone of that ilk.  However,
    evidence  of  this  rather  limited  kind  in  our  judgment  does  not
    necessarily require expertise of that order and the main question  from
    our perspective will be the weight to be attached to it.  We take  into
    account further that there is no prejudice to  the  Respondent  and  no
    suggestion of inappropriate timing or being taken by surprise.

 5) We shall admit this evidence and in due course shall form a view on the
    weight if any to be attached to it.
