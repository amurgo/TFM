Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss. A. Radford, Counsel instructed by CK Law
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Britton promulgated on 7 May 2015 in which he
    allowed Mr. Gonapaladeniya's appeal against the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to refuse leave to remain on the grounds of family and private
    life under the Immigration Rules.

 2. For the purposes of this decision I will  refer  to  the  Secretary  of
    State as the Respondent and to Mr.  Gonapaladeniya  as  the  Appellant,
    reflecting their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.



 3. At the hearing I heard submissions, following which I announced that  I
    found that the decision did not involve the making of an error of  law.
    My reasons for this decision are set out below.

Submissions

 4. Mr. Whitwell adopted the grounds of appeal.  He referred  to  paragraph
    [31] and  the  final  decision,  where  there  are  references  to  two
    convictions, as opposed to paragraphs [25] and  [29]  where  the  judge
    refers to one conviction.  He  submitted  that  the  position  was  not
    clear.  For the purposes of the guidance referred to in paragraphs [24]
    and [30], one single conviction  where  a  non-custodial  sentence  was
    imposed was not usually enough to cause a refusal under the  character,
    conduct and association grounds.  I was referred  to  the  decision  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Gill to grant permission to bring judicial  review
    proceedings in which it states:

    "It is arguable that a single conviction for battery over a  period  of
    10 years' lawful residence for which a fine of ï¿½300  was  imposed  does
    not reasonably entitle the Respondent to find that  the  Applicant  did
    not meet the suitability criteria on the ground that his  presence  was
    not conducive to the public good."

 5.      In relation to the second ground of appeal relating to  Article  8
    outside the immigration rules, Mr. Whitwell  submitted  that  this  was
    dependent on the first limb.  In paragraph [32] the  judge  found  that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles to the  Appellant  returning  to
    Sri Lanka, and his wife joining him there.  He therefore submitted that
    there could be no exceptional circumstances justifying consideration or
    allowing the appeal outside of the immigration rules.   The  fact  that
    the Appellant's spouse had indefinite leave to remain and owned a  home
    was not sufficient to make it exceptional.

 6. Ms Radford relied on the Rule 24 response.  She  submitted  that  there
    had been a mistake of fact in the  grounds  when  it  stated  that  the
    Appellant  had  two  convictions.   The  Appellant  did  not  have  two
    convictions, but had one conviction with two counts.  I was referred to
    paragraphs [4] and [25] of the decision where the judge refers  to  one
    conviction.  The one incident had led to two separate offences,  and  a
    multi-count charge.  This one incident when the Appellant had acted  in
    a criminal way had correctly led to one conviction.

 7.      In relation to the Respondent's guidance, she submitted that  this
    was  not  exhaustive.   It  was  a  discretionary  power  and  involved
    considering whether the exclusion of an applicant was conducive to  the
    public good taking into account the period of time spent in the  United
    Kingdom and his character, amongst other factors.  The judge had  found
    that this was not an offence which  led  to  the  Appellant's  presence
    being not conducive to the public good.

 8.      Ms Radford submitted that the error in the decision was where  the
    judge had said that the Appellant had two convictions, but this was not
    a material error.  She submitted that the judge had properly understood
    that there was one  incident  giving  rise  to  two  offences  but  one
    conviction.

 9.      In relation to the second ground, in paragraph [31] the judge  had
    found that the Appellant met the suitability requirements.   There  was
    therefore no obligation for him  to  look  at  Article  8  outside  the
    immigration rules and the question of whether  or  not  the  Article  8
    consideration had been adequately reasoned therefore did not arise.  In
    any event it  needed  to  be  read  with  the  rest  of  the  decision.
    Paragraphs [31] and [32] contained relevant considerations which  would
    be balanced against the public interest.

10.  In  conclusion  she  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  one   spent
    conviction.  In the granting of permission for judicial review  it  had
    clearly been stated that this  was  not  enough  to  suggest  that  the
    suitability criteria had not been met by the Appellant.


Error of law decision

11.      I find that the Appellant has only one conviction, and I find that
    the decision is clear that the judge was aware of this.  In  paragraphs
    [4], [25] and [29] the judge correctly refers to the fact that  he  has
    only one conviction.  I accept that in paragraph [31] and in the  final
    decision the judge refers to two convictions.   However,  I  find  that
    this error is not  material,  and  is  not  capable  of  affecting  the
    decision.  The relevance of one conviction is correctly  understood  by
    the judge in relation to the Respondent's guidance.  This is quoted  in
    paragraph [24]:


    "It is unlikely a person would be refused under the character,  conduct
    and association grounds for a single conviction that results in a  non-
    custodial sentence outside the relevant timeframe."


    It is clear from the decision when read as a whole that  the  judge  is
    aware that the Appellant has  one  conviction  for  which  he  did  not
    receive a custodial sentence only a fine and the conviction is spent.


12.      The decision makes clear that the  judge  is  well  aware  of  the
    circumstances which led to the conviction.  In paragraph [14] the judge
    sets out the circumstances of  the  incident.   In  paragraph  [26]  he
    states:


    "Considering the  whole  of  the  evidence  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant's action on this day is out of character and it is  extremely
    unlikely that he will appear before the criminal court again."

13.      The judge has taken into account the circumstances leading to  the
    conviction.  He has taken into account the character of the  Appellant.
    In so doing, he has taken into  account  the  evidence  of  Mrs.  Susan
    Green, paragraphs [19] and [20].  In paragraph [26] he  refers  to  the
    fact that Mrs. Green gave evidence as to the Appellant's character.  He
    found Mrs Green to be an honest and reliable witness.

14.      Considering the decision as a whole, it is clear that the judge is
    aware that the Appellant has only one conviction.  He  has  taken  into
    account the Respondent's guidance and applied  it  to  the  Appellant's
    circumstances.   He  has  taken  into  account  the  evidence  of   the
    Appellant, his wife and Mrs.  Green  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    character and conduct.  He has found, as set  out  in  paragraph  [31],
    that the Appellant meets the suitability  requirements.   He  does  not
    find that the presence of the Appellant in the United  Kingdom  is  not
    conducive to the public good.

15.      I find that the decision does not contain a material error of law.
     The references to two convictions are an error, but are not capable of
    affecting the outcome of the decision.  The judge was entitled to  find
    that the Appellant met the suitability requirements and  therefore  met
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

16.      In relation to the second ground, having found that the  Appellant
    met the requirements of the immigration rules, it was not necessary for
    the judge to go on to consider Article 8 outside the immigration rules.
     Therefore, having found that the decision does not involve the  making
    of a material error of law in relation to the immigration rules,  there
    can be no material error of law in the consideration of  Article  8  in
    paragraph [32].  As accepted by the Respondent's representative at  the
    hearing, this ground was parasitic on the first ground.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve the  making  of  an
error of law capable of affecting the outcome of the decision.

I do not set aside the decision.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
