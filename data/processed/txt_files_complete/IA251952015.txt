                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     The above matter comes before the Tribunal following the  decision  of
      Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup dated  13.6.17  setting  aside  the
      decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal IJ Parker dated  27.10.16
      allowing the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  of
      2.7.15  refusing  leave  to  remain  and  refusing  her  human  rights
      application. I shall refer to the parties  as  they  were  before  the
      First tier.

2     I reiterate some of the  issues  before  Judge  Parker,  as  they  are
      relevant to the issues which remain to be  determined  in  the  appeal
      before me. The Appellant first entered the United Kingdom on or around
      1.11.07 and claimed asylum asserting that she was a  Somali  national,
      of minority Bajuni clan origin, born on [ ] 1985. She gave an involved
      account of the persecution that she and her family members  had  faced
      from majority clans in Somalia, including an account that  her  father
      and sister had been killed and that she had been raped.  This  account
      was accepted by the Respondent and she was  recognised  as  a  refugee
      upon first application in a decision made in October 2009.

3     On or around 9.9.14, the Appellant applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
      remain as a person having  enjoyed  five  years  leave  to  remain  as
      refugee.  Seemingly,   during   the   course   of   the   Respondent's
      consideration of that application, it became known to  the  Respondent
      that the Appellant had in fact been granted  entry  clearance  to  the
      United Kingdom on 12.4.07, in the same name,  but  as  a  person  with
      Tanzanian nationality, and with a date of birth of 17.5.83. Before me,
      Mr McVeety suggested that it may simply have been an oversight on  the
      part of the Respondent that a match in  the  bio  data  of  these  two
      identities had not been  noticed  when  the  Appellant  first  claimed
      asylum.

4     In a document from the Respondent dated 18.6.15,  reasons  were  given
      for revoking the Appellant's refugee status  on  the  basis  of  false
      representation, and on 2.7.15, her application for indefinite leave to
      remain, which was also treated as  a  human  rights  application,  was
      refused, with a right of appeal. The Appellant's subsequent appeal  to
      the First tier was treated as having been  brought  on  grounds  under
      s.84(3) NIAA 2002 as an appeal against revocation of  refugee  status,
      and under s.84(2) NIAA 2002 as an appeal against refusal of her  human
      rights claim.

5     Before Judge Parker, the Appellant asserted that  she  was  of  Somali
      origin, and was of the Bajuni clan, but accepted  that  she  had  been
      born in Tanzania on 17.5.83 and that her account of events in  Somalia
      had been untrue. She claimed to have been trafficked to the UK by  one
      Sleyyum Nassor Mohammed ('SNM'), a Tanzanian national, who  had  also,
      she asserted, falsely asserted to the UK authorities  to  be  Suleiman
      Cali Maxamaed, a Somali national. She had married him in Tanzania  and
      had been brought to the UK by  him.  She  claimed  that  this  was  an
      abusive relationship, and he had encouraged her to claim asylum  in  a
      false identity.  The Appellant had a child in the UK  by  SNM;  'HSN',
      born in September 2008.

6     In his decision of 27.10.16,  Judge  Parker  upheld  the  Respondent's
      decision to revoke the Appellant's refugee status,  finding  that  the
      Appellant had made false  statements  in  support  of  her  protection
      claim. The Judge found the Appellant not  to  be  a  credible  witness
      [22]; and 'without credibility' [25]. The Judge declined to  make  any
      finding as to whether or not the Appellant was trafficked to  the  UK,
      finding that if she wished to make a fresh submission  for  asylum  on
      that basis to the Respondent, she should do so [22].

7     However, the Judge took the circumstances of the Appellant's  daughter
      HSN into account, and purported to allow the  appeal  both  under  the
      immigration rules under paragraph 276 ADE(1)(iv) and (vi), and on ECHR
      grounds under Article 8.

8     There has been no appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the  Appellant
      against Judge Parker's  decision  to  uphold  the  revocation  of  the
      Appellant's refugee status.

9     The Respondent appealed to the  Upper  Tribunal  against  the  Judge's
      decision to allow the appeal under the immigration rules and on  human
      rights grounds. Following an error of law  hearing  on  5.6.17,  Judge
      Pickup held that the Judge's decision was erroneous  in  law  for  the
      reasons given by Judge Pickup in his decision of 27.6.17, and  he  set
      aside Judge Parker's decision as it related to human  rights  grounds,
      but preserved  Judge  Parker's  findings  on  the  revocation  of  the
      Appellant's refugee status, up  to  paragraph  26  of  Judge  Parker's
      decision.

10    Although not expressly stated within Judge Pickup's decision, I  would
      also venture to say that Judge Parker's decision,  seemingly  allowing
      the Appellant's appeal under the immigration  rules,  was  made  ultra
      vires; the grounds of appeal available to the Appellant in her  appeal
      before Judge Parker were limited to human rights grounds, and  whether
      the decision to  revoke  refugee  status  was  contrary  to  the  UK's
      obligations under the Refugee convention or to persons eligible for  a
      grant of humanitarian protection. There was  no  power  to  allow  the
      Appellant's appeal under the immigration rules.

11    Judge Pickup adjourned the remaking of the  Appellant's  appeal  to  a
      further hearing before the Upper Tribunal, and gave  directions  inter
      alia that the Appellant was to ensure that all evidence to  be  relied
      upon at such hearing was to be contained within a single consolidated,
      indexed and paginated bundle of all objective and subjective material,
      together with any skeleton argument and copies of all case authorities
      to be relied upon. Principal Resident Judge  Dawson  made  a  Transfer
      Order  pursuant  to  the  Senior  President  of   Tribunals   Practice
      Statement, dated 25.7.17, permitting the rehearing of the appeal to be
      heard by a differently constituted  tribunal.  The  matter  thus  came
      before me on 10.8.17.

12    The Appellant had filed a consolidated  bundle  of  material  for  the
      purposes of the present hearing, the first part of  which  appears  to
      replicate the Appellant's bundle before the First tier, and the second
      part of which contains a copy of  the  Respondent's  bundle  in  these
      proceedings.   The   Appellant's   witness   statement   within   this
      consolidated bundle is dated 18.7.16,  this  being  the  same  witness
      statement placed before Judge Parker. No further witness statement  of
      the Appellant had been produced.

13    At the outset of  the  hearing,  I  raised  before  both  parties  the
      potential significance of the identity and immigration status of HSN's
      father.  The Appellant had at one time asserted  that  SNM  was  HSN's
      father, and that SNM was settled in the United Kingdom. Although Judge
      Parker held that there was no evidence  that  HSN's  father  possessed
      British nationality, HSN might also  possess  British  nationality  if
      born in the United Kingdom to a father possessing indefinite leave  to
      remain (s.1(1)(b)) BNA 1981), or in the alternative, the  child  could
      apply to be registered as a British  citizen,  if  the  father  gained
      settled status in the United Kingdom prior to  the  daughter  reaching
      the age of majority (s.1(3)(a) and (b) BNA 1981). I  therefore  raised
      with the parties whether any further information was available  as  to
      the true identity, nationality,  and  immigration  status  within  the
      United Kingdom, of the father of HSN. I allowed the matter to be stood
      down for Mr Maqsood to take further instructions on this matter.

14    On resuming the hearing, Mr Maqsood informed  me  that  the  Appellant
      accepted that the biological father of her daughter,  irrespective  of
      his true identity or nationality, did not hold settled  status  within
      the United Kingdom, and thus there was no question of the  Appellant's
      daughter  possessing,  or  potentially  being  entitled  to,   British
      nationality.

15    The matter therefore proceeded by way of oral evidence.

16    The  Appellant  adopted  her  witness  statement  dated  18.7.16.  The
      Appellant needed no interpreter. Mr  Maqsood  asked  if  he  could  be
      permitted to ask number of additional questions by way of examinations
      in chief. I reminded  Mr  Maqsood  that  there  had  been  a  specific
      direction that all of  the  Appellant's  evidence  being  produced  in
      documentary form prior to the present hearing. He  asserted  that  his
      instructing solicitors had been instructed  relatively  recently,  and
      that they had not had the opportunity to prepare an additional witness
      statement. I asked Mr Maqsood to bear the direction in mind, but  that
      permitted him to ask a  number  of  additional  questions  by  way  of
      examination in chief.

17    It is part of the Appellant's account that she left Tanzania  in  2004
      to study in Turkey for a period of time.  The  Appellant  stated  that
      prior to her departure for Turkey, she had lived in Tanzania with  her
      mother and father. Her father had died in 2003. She  stated  that  the
      family home in which the family resided prior to  her  father's  death
      had  been  sold,  in  part  to  fund  her  studies  in  Turkey.   That
      accommodation was no longer available in Tanzania. She stated that she
      still had her mother and brother living in Tanzania. (She did  not  at
      this point mention a sister.) She stated that her  mother  lived  with
      members of the community. When asked if the Appellant could live  with
      her mother, the Appellant denied that this was possible, stating  that
      her mother had no sustainable income and could not  offer  support  to
      for her or her daughter.

18    The Appellant  stated  that  her  brother  was  living  in  a  hostel,
      studying, and receiving support from the government.

19    The Appellant stated that her daughter spoke only  English,  and  that
      the languages spoken in Tanzania  were  Swahili  and  Arabic,  in  her
      particular area.  She stated that she had no savings, and had not been
      able to afford to amass any savings in the United Kingdom because  her
      outgoings took all of her earned income.

20    The Appellant stated  that  her  daughter  had  no  contact  with  her
      father. He had at one time applied to  the  courts  for  contact,  and
      family lawyers acting for her daughter's father suggested mediation at
      one point, although the  Appellant  declined  to  take  part  in  such
      mediation. The Appellant stated that her daughter's father  wished  to
      send her daughter to Tanzania, and it was that reason which  made  the
      Appellant reluctant to establish contact with her  daughter's  father.
      When Mr Maqsood asked why the Appellant was reluctant for contact, the
      Appellant started to explain that her daughter's father wished to take
      her daughter to Tanzania to arrange for her  to  be  circumcised,  and
      that he was under pressure from his family to have this done.

21    At this juncture of the evidence, I indicated to Mr Maqsood  that  the
      evidence now being given by the Appellant  appeared  to  amount  to  a
      protection claim. Mr Maqsood repeatedly asserted  that  the  potential
      risk of harm to the Appellant's daughter was relevant to the issue  of
      whether or not it would be reasonable, under  section  117B  (6)  NIAA
      2002 to expect the Appellant's daughter to leave the  United  Kingdom,
      and therefore was a relevant matter before the Tribunal at the present
      hearing.

22    I reminded Mr Maqsood of the very specific directions given  by  Judge
      Pickup in the present matter, and invited him to indicate whether this
      protection  claim  relating  to  the  Appellant's  daughter  had  been
      mentioned at any prior stage of the Appellant's own asylum  claim.  He
      was unable to direct my attention to any  reference  to  the  risk  of
      circumcision to the daughter at  any  point,  prior  to  today's  oral
      evidence. I pointed out to Mr Maqsood that there had been a number  of
      opportunities for the Appellant to raise this matter; in her  original
      application asylum; in the grounds of appeal against the  Respondent's
      decisions bringing her appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal;  in  her
      evidence before Judge Parker; and in any  potential  appeal  from  the
      First-tier Tribunal to the Upper Tribunal in  relation  to  revocation
      refugee status. No such opportunity had been taken at  any  stage.  Mr
      Maqsood again attempted to reiterate the fact that  any  risk  to  the
      Appellant's daughter would be relevant as to the reasonableness of her
      being required to leave the United Kingdom.

23    I invited the views of Mr McVeety who expressed the opinion that  this
      protection claim would  amount to the new  matter,  as  defined  under
      section  85  NIAA  2002,  which  would  require  the  consent  of  the
      Respondent state in order for the Tribunal to consider the matter.  He
      declined to give consent on behalf of the Respondent for such  matters
      to be considered.

24    I ruled at the hearing that I was in agreement with Mr  McVeety,  that
      this matter represented a new matter as defined under section 85  NIAA
      2002, and, in the absence  of  the  consent  of  the  Respondent,  the
      Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to entertain this issue. Further  and  in
      any event, I would have ruled as part of my  general  case  management
      powers under Rules 5  and  7  (failure  of  a  party  to  comply  with
      directions) Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008,  to  limit
      the issues to be determined in the  appeal  to  those  raised  in  the
      Appellant's witness statement, and not  to  permit  any  further  oral
      evidence about an alleged risk of harm to the Appellant's daughter  in
      the form of circumcision in Tanzania. This Tribunal is of the opinion,
      given the history of this  appeal,  the  directions  issued  by  Judge
      Pickup, and my reference to such  directions  at  the  outset  of  the
      Appellant's oral evidence, that for  this  reference  to  a  potential
      claim for protection in relation to the  Appellant's  daughter  to  be
      raised well into examination  in  chief  of  the  Appellant,  with  no
      advance notice to the Tribunal, is an abuse of process, and a flagrant
      breach of directions.  This Tribunal shall not consider the  issue  of
      potential harm to the Appellant's daughter  any  further  within  this
      decision. If the Appellant wishes to advance  a  protection  claim  on
      those grounds, she should do so to the Respondent,  by  way  of  fresh
      representations, if so advised, although the Respondent will no  doubt
      query why this matter was not raised in response to  the  Respondent's
      notice under s.120 NIAA 2002 within her decision of 2.7.15.

25    Mr Maqsood's examination in chief of  the  Appellant  continued.   The
      Appellant stated that she had taken her daughter to Tanzania in  2011,
      and had also taken her to Kenya in 2013 so  that  her  family  members
      might visit the Appellant and her daughter there at that time.

26    The Appellant stated that her daughter had found it  difficult  whilst
      at school in the UK; she did not have a relationship with her  father,
      as she noticed that other  children  had  a  relationship  with  their
      fathers. The Appellant confirmed that although her  daughter  met  the
      father whilst an infant, she now had no functioning relationship  with
      the father. It was said that  most  of  the  daughter's  friends  were
      English. The Appellant stated that she was in contact with her mother.



27    The Appellant stated  that  her  job  in  the  UK  was  as  a  cardiac
      physiologist.  This  involved  undertaking  angiography,   and   being
      involved in surgical procedures of  inserting  vascular  implants  and
      stents. She worked with GPs in the  community  carrying  out  relevant
      tests on patients, and  she  also  undertook  work  for  the  DVLA  in
      assessing lorry drivers' fitness to drive. She  was  employed  at  the
      Nottingham University Hospital.

28    The Appellant stated that she would not be able to utilise her  skills
      in Zanzibar because the health  care  system  there  was  undeveloped.
      There was only approximately 1 million people in  Zanzibar.   I  asked
      whether the Appellant could utilise her skills by  seeking  employment
      on the mainland of Tanzania, for example in the capital Dar es Salaam.
      The  Appellant  replied  that  in  2016  a  new  ID  card  system  was
      introduced, and she was not present to obtain such an ID card  at  the
      time. The Appellant asserted that she would not therefore be  able  to
      travel between Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.

29    The Appellant asserted that her daughter would not be able to  benefit
      from state education Tanzania,  there  being  no  state  education  in
      English, and the Appellant would be unable to afford private education
      in the English language, which she stated would only be available at a
      cost of US$7700 per year.

30    Cross-examined by Mr McVeety, the Appellant confirmed that she  had  a
      mother and brother in Tanzania. There were other relatives  in  Kenya,
      and other kinship in Somalia. The Appellant had in total two brothers,
      and one sister. One brother was in Congo, and one sister was living on
      the island of Pemba. I reminded the Appellant that she had  just  been
      asked what relatives she had in Tanzania and she  mentioned  only  her
      mother and a brother. She confirmed that she also had a sister in  the
      island of Pemba. That sister  farmed,  producing  her  own  home-grown
      produce, and her  husband  was  a  teacher  in  a  local  school.  The
      Appellant clarified that Tanzania comprised mainland Tanzania, and the
      region of Zanzibar, which was  mainly  comprised  of  the  islands  of
      Unguja and the smaller island of Pemba. She confirmed that  there  was
      no restriction of movement between Unguja and Pemba. The Appellant was
      born on Unguja.

31    The Appellant confirmed to Mr McVeety that her father  died  in  2003,
      and she accepted that it was a lie  when  she  stated  in  her  asylum
      interview that he had been killed  in  Somalia  in  2007.  Mr  McVeety
      referred the Appellant to the content of an entry clearance  interview
      which had taken place prior to the issuing of entry clearance in April
      2007. (The dates in 2011 and 2015 given on the two  different  printed
      copies of this interview are incorrect  -  Mr  McVeety  considered  it
      likely that these  dates  may  have  been  created  electronically  on
      occasions when the interview had been printed at one time or  another.
      It is clear from the content of the interview that it related  to  the
      Appellant's application for entry clearance made in 2007.)

32    In that interview, the Appellant was asked  what  family  she  had  in
      Tanzania, and she was recorded as saying that she had her  mother  and
      father there. Mr McVeety pointed  out  to  the  Appellant  that  notes
      recorded by the Entry Clearance Officer relating to  this  application
      at F2 referred to the application being supported by her  father.  The
      Appellant confirmed that  the  application  had  been  made,  and  the
      interview had been carried out, in 2007,  in  Turkey,  where  she  was
      residing at the time.

33    When asked  to  explain  the  reference  to  a  father  in  2007,  the
      Appellant paused before stating that she  had  a  stepfather,  as  her
      mother had remarried after her father's death in  2003,  although  the
      marriage did not last long. She stated her real father was called F J,
      who had been born in Somalia and had migrated  to  Tanzania  in  1998,
      although she immediately corrected this to  the  1980s.  She  accepted
      that the information recorded in her screening interview for her claim
      for asylum, that her father had died in 2007 in Somalia, was untrue.

34    Mr McVeety asked the Appellant what her  stepfather's  job  had  been.
      The Appellant stated that he had been a businessman. It was put to her
      that information in the ECO's records at F2 was that the father  being
      referred to was a doctor  in  Tanzania.  The  Appellant  paused  again
      before explaining that this information had  been  false.  She  stated
      that she had been living in a hostel for  girls  in  Turkey  and  they
      would not have permitted her to come to the UK on  her  own,  and  she
      needed some evidence that she received financial  support  from  other
      sources. She  accepted  that  she  had  lied  when  making  the  entry
      clearance  application.  She  could  not  remember  what   documentary
      evidence was submitted in support of the application.

35    Following the lunch adjournment the Appellant continued her  evidence.
      The Appellant  confirmed  that  the  official  languages  of  Tanzania
      included Swahili, Arabic, and English on the mainland. When it was put
      to her that her daughter could be taught in English on  the  mainland,
      the Appellant reiterated that she was from Unguja  where  Swahili  and
      Arabic was spoken. The Appellant stated that on the mainland,  English
      was  taught  as  a  subject  in  schools,  but  not  as  a  medium  of
      instruction. When asked why she could not get  skilled  employment  on
      the mainland, the Appellant  reiterated  that  she  did  not  have  an
      identity card to  travel  to  the  mainland,  although  the  Appellant
      accepted that if she registered, she might be able to get such a card.
      She had not been in Tanzania since 2005, and she thought it may not be
      easy. She did not have any evidence as to the system of obtaining such
      an identity card.

36    The Appellant confirmed that she did not have any relatives in  United
      Kingdom, and has never had any such relatives here. She  was  referred
      an extract within the ECO's notes at F2, which  appeared  to  indicate
      that the Appellant had a sister in the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant
      explained that this was not the case, and that she had explained  that
      this to the officer at the time of the application.

37    The Appellant stated  that  her  salary  in  the  United  Kingdom  was
      �22,665. Her witness statement stated that she was  able  to  maintain
      herself and her daughter without recourse to public funds, (although I
      notice that paragraph 35 of the statement adds  in  handwriting,  that
      she receives child benefit and tax credits). She  confirmed  that  she
      had a child tax credit/working tax credit award of approximately  �130
      a week. During the time she was claiming  asylum,  she  obtained  NASS
      support of about �35 week plus accommodation. While  studying  in  the
      UK, she took advantage of the student loan facility.

38    In response to questions from me, the  Appellant  confirmed  that  her
      mother lives in Unguja. After the original family home was  sold,  her
      mother bought a smaller property, which was a two bedroomed house with
      a sitting room, kitchen, and bathroom and toilet access through a back
      garden. Her mother rented this out for approximately $50 a month.  Her
      mother lived in a suburb of Zanzibar Town called Mwembetanga, about 30
      minutes walk from Zanzibar Town.

39    Her brother lived in Unguja, in Nungwi, in the north  of  the  island.
      He has completed  his  studies,  having  a  'PCB'  degree  in  general
      sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Biology). He was 29 years old, and is
      currently undergoing a period of national service,  including  working
      in hospitals and schools. He is provided with accommodation  and  food
      as part of his National Service.  He  wants  to  be  a  teacher  after
      completing his National Service. When asked  what  proportion  of  the
      population of Unguja and Pemba had degrees, the Appellant stated  that
      this was a very minimal number.  There  was  only  one  university  in
      Unguja. The population was small in  Unguja.   People  get  grants  to
      attend university. When asked what her brother's prospects of  getting
      a job were, the Appellant stated that he  will  probably  be  able  to
      obtain full employment after his National service, there being a  need
      of teachers everywhere in Unguja. Her brother is not married  and  has
      no children. The Appellant has a good relationship with her brother.

40    Further regarding her mother, the Appellant  confirmed  that  she  was
      now approximately 65 years old. She had previously worked as a teacher
      although did so without having obtained a degree. She has a pension as
      a retired teacher. The Appellant  agreed  that  both  her  mother  and
      brother were educationalists. She explained that her mother lived with
      'relatives in the community' in Fuoni, outside of Zanzibar town.  Upon
      further  consideration  of  her  circumstances,  it  transpired   that
      essentially, her mother resided in  a  female-run  Madrassa,  teaching
      religious studies. There were a number of women who lived there,  each
      occupying their own small room, with some shared facilities.  She  did
      not know if her mother paid anything to reside there, but  she  agreed
      that her mother's duties as a teacher were part of the arrangement  to
      allow her to reside there. The Appellant said it  was  a  bit  like  a
      convent. When asked, if the Appellant got a job in Unguja,  could  the
      Appellant rent the property from her mother, the Appellant  said  yes,
      and the mother may well join the Appellant there.

41    The Appellant confirmed that  her  first  language  was  Swahili.  She
      stated that she had not spoken Swahili with her  daughter  whilst  she
      was young, as her daughter had stayed with childminders  for  much  of
      her infancy.

42    There was no re-examination of the Appellant.

43    I then heard submissions from the parties, which are  set  out  in  my
      written record of proceedings.

      Relevant law

44    The issue before me is whether the refusal of  the  Appellant's  human
      rights claim is unlawful under  s.6  Human  Rights  Act  1998.  Having
      excluded  the  potential  argument  regarding  risk  of  harm  to  the
      Appellant's daughter from my considerations, for reasons  set  out  at
      paragraphs 21-24 above, I proceed to  consider  whether  the  decision
      amounts to a disproportionate and therefore unlawful interference with
      the private and family lives of the Appellant and her daughter.

45    It is relevant to consider whether  the  Appellant  or  HSN  meet  any
      relevant immigration rule.  If  they  do,  this  would  be  a  weighty
      consideration when  assessing  the  proportionality  of  the  decision
      impugned (Mostafa (Article 8  in  entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  112
      (IAC)). There would need to be compelling circumstances to  justify  a
      grant of leave to remain outside the rules: SSHD v SS  (Congo)  &  Ors
      [2015] EWCA Civ 387, para  33.  I  take  into  account  as  a  primary
      consideration the best interests HSN (ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC
      4). I also take into account the considerations set  out  in  Part  5A
      NIAA 2002.

46    Is this case involves the best interests of a child in the UK, I  take
      into account the guidance provided in EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ
      874, in which the Court of Appeal held as follows:

           (i) The Court rejected the proposition advanced at [21]  by  the
           appellants that where it was established that the best interests
           of children lay in their continuing their education in  the  UK,
           that only 'the most cogent countervailing considerations'  could
           justify the removal  of  the  family;  insofar  as  Lord  Kerr's
           judgment in ZH Tanzania v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 appeared to advance
           the proposition that the best interests of a  child  'must  rank
           higher' than any other factor, the Court noted that he was there
           dealing with British children, that  he  had  agreed  with  Lady
           Hale, and the Court should be guided by  the  formulation  which
           she adopted which was that the best interests of a child  was  a
           primary  consideration  which  could  be  outweighed  by  others
           provided that no other consideration was treated  as  inherently
           more significant (see Christopher Clarke LJ at [32]).

           (ii) The best interests of the child are  to  be  determined  by
           reference  to  the  child  alone  without   reference   to   the
           immigration history or  status  of  either  parent  (Christopher
           Clarke LJ at [33]).

           (iii)       "34 In determining whether or not, in a case  (where
                 none of the family are British  and  they  are  relying  on
                 private and family life grounds to remain in the  UK),  the
                 need for immigration control outweighs the  best  interests
                 of the children, it is necessary to determine the  relative
                 strength of  the  factors  which  make  it  in  their  best
                 interests to remain here; and also to take account  of  any
                 factors that point the other way.

                 35. A decision as to what  is  in  the  best  interests  of
                 children will depend on a number of  factors  such  as  (a)
                 their age; (b) the length of time that they have been here;
                 (c) how long they have been in education;  (c)  what  stage
                 their education has reached; (d) to what extent  they  have
                 become distanced from the country to which it  is  proposed
                 that they return; (e) how renewable their  connection  with
                 it may be; (f) to what extent they  will  have  linguistic,
                 medical or other difficulties in adapting to life  in  that
                 country; and (g) the extent to which  the  course  proposed
                 will interfere with their family life or their  rights  (if
                 they have any) as British citizens .

                 36. In a sense the tribunal is concerned with how  emphatic
                 an answer falls to be given to the question: is it  in  the
                 best interests of the child to remain? The longer the child
                 has been here, the more advanced (or critical) the stage of
                 his education, the looser his  ties  with  the  country  in
                 question, and the more deleterious the consequences of  his
                 return, the greater the weight that falls into one side  of
                 the scales. If it is overwhelmingly  in  the  child's  best
                 interests that he should not return, the need  to  maintain
                 immigration control  may  well  not  tip  the  balance.  By
                 contrast if it is in the child's best interests to  remain,
                 but only on balance (with some factors pointing  the  other
                 way), the result may be the opposite.

                 37. In the balance on the other  side  there  falls  to  be
                 taken into account the strong weight to  be  given  to  the
                 need to maintain immigration  control  in  pursuit  of  the
                 economic well-being of the country and the fact that,    ex
                 hypothesi, the applicants have no  entitlement  to  remain.
                 The immigration history of the parents may also be relevant
                 e.g. if they are overstayers, or have acted deceitfully.  "
                 ( Christopher Clarke LJ at [34-37])

           (iv) The approach to the assessment of best interests set out in
           paragraphs 23-24 of MK  India  (Best  interests  of  the  child)
           [2011] UKUT 475 (IAC) was  approved,  which  emphasises  a  fact
           sensitive, 'overall' balancing of factors (Christopher Clarke LJ
           at [39]).

           (v) In answering the question whether one has to assess the best
           interest of the  children  without  regard  to  the  immigration
           status of the parent, the assessment of the  best  interests  of
           the children must be decided on the basis that the facts are  as
           they are in the real world; the ultimate question will be: is it
           reasonable to expect the child to follow  the  parents  with  no
           right to remain to the country of origin? (Lewison LJ, [50]  and
           [58]).

47    I  specifically  find  that  the  most  often  quoted  passage  of  EV
      (Philippines) "Just as we cannot provide  medical  treatment  for  the
      world, so we cannot educate the world" (Lewison LJ at [60])  does  not
      form part of the ratio of the case; it does not  seek  to  approve  or
      disapprove a proposition  in  law;  it  is  something  of  an  overall
      observation but which should not be treated by the Respondent as  some
      indefeasible mantra.

48    In  MA (Pakistan) & Ors, R (on the application of)  v  Upper  Tribunal
      (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) & Anor [2016] EWCA  Civ  705  it  was
      held that when considering para  276  ADE(1)(iv)  of  the  immigration
      rules and section 117B(6) NIAA 2002, a court or  tribunal  should  not
      simply focus on the child but should also have regard to wider  public
      interest considerations, including the conduct and immigration history
      of the parents; the significance of section 117B(6) is that where  the
      seven year rule is satisfied, it is a factor of some weight leaning in
      favour of leave to remain being granted (para 45).

      Findings of fact

49    To determine whether any interference  with  the  private  and  family
      life of the Appellant and  her  daughter  would  be  disproportionate,
      findings need to be made about their  circumstances  in  the  UK,  and
      their likely circumstances in Tanzania. In the context of this appeal,
      the Appellant has the burden of establishing those facts on a  balance
      of probabilities.

50    Insofar as Judge Parker held that the fact that the Appellant lied  in
      her asylum application renders here evermore 'without credibility',  I
      would not necessarily agree  with  that  analysis.  The  fact  that  a
      witness has been found to have lied about matters 10 years ago,  would
      not automatically justify a finding that the witness  is  lying  about
      all later matters.

51    However, I find  that  there  are  further  reasons,  aside  from  the
      Appellant's deception in  her  asylum  claim,  for  finding  that  the
      Appellant has been less than candid about her circumstances in the  UK
      and likely circumstances in Tanzania. She accepted that she also  lied
      in her entry clearance application of 2007. When challenged about  the
      evidence in the entry clearance interview about a father,  who  was  a
      doctor, being alive in 2007, the  Appellant  gave  the  impression  of
      making her evidence up as  she  went  along.  In  oral  evidence,  she
      initially failed to disclose that she  had  a  sister  in  Pemba.  Her
      witness evidence and oral evidence in examination in chief did  little
      to provide a full and frank description of her family circumstances in
      Tanzania. None  of  her  assertions  about  prospects  of  employment,
      freedom of movement or education opportunities for  her  daughter  are
      supported by any country information whatsoever.

52    In relation to  her  circumstances  in  the  UK,  I  accept  that  the
      Appellant is employed as a cardiac  physiologist.  The  Appellant  has
      provided evidence of her obtaining a BSc in Healthcare Science from De
      Montford University Leicester in Cardiovascular, Respiratory and Sleep
      Science  in  June  2015.  There  is  also  documentary  evidence   her
      employment at Nottingham University Hospital NHS  Trust.  Neither  the
      Appellant nor HSN have any kind of  relationship  with  HSN's  father,
      whatever his true identity may be. He is not British or settled and no
      question arises in this appeal that HSN may be British.

53    HSN was born in the UK and has resided here for  8,  nearly  9  years,
      although at the date of  the  Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
      remain on 9.9.14, she had resided in the  UK  for  just  less  than  6
      years. There are end of year reports from July 2015 (year 1)  and  May
      2016 (year 2) from HSN's school stating that she is doing well, and is
      a bright and intelligent girl. There is no copy of any  school  report
      for this most recent academic year ending July 2017. I assume that she
      has recently completed year 3. I take judicial notice that this  would
      be the end of Key Stage 1 and that she will  recently  have  undergone
      any relevant assessments at the end of Key Stage 1. She would  have  a
      further  3  years  of  primary  education  in  years  4,  5,  and   6,
      representing Key Stage 2. I find that HSN  is  not  presently  at  any
      crucial stage of her education.  I am prepared to accept that most  of
      HSN's friends may be 'English', but that says little in  itself  about
      their ethnic background or HSN's familiarity of a variety of cultures.



54     I  make  no  findings  on  the  Appellant's  alleged   past   abusive
      relationship with HSN's father  or  the  circumstances  in  which  the
      Appellant entered the UK; Judge Parker declined to  make  findings  on
      those matters, and there is no appeal  brought  by  the  Appellant  in
      relation the 'protection' element  of  Judge  Parker's  decision.  The
      Appellant gives no evidence about her  own  ties  to  the  UK  eg  her
      friendships, other than providing evidence about her employment.

55    Regarding the Appellant's likely circumstances  in  Tanzania,  I  find
      that the Appellant, now 34, lived in  Tanzania  for  the  first  20-21
      years of her life, before travelling to Turkey, and was accustomed  to
      its culture, language,  traditions,  and  norms.  I  accept  what  the
      Appellant said in answer to questions from me about  her  family;  she
      has a mother, who is a retired teacher, with a pension, living in  the
      outskirts of Zanzibar Town. She lives and works  in  a  Madrassa.  The
      mother owns a 2 bedroomed property (described in  more  detail  above)
      which is currently rented out. The Appellant has a sister in Pemba who
      is married to a teacher. The Appellant has a brother currently  living
      in the north of  Unguja  who  is  a  graduate,  currently  undertaking
      national services but who has good prospects of gaining employment  as
      a teacher. Given the various conflicts  in  the  Appellant's  evidence
      regarding her father, I do not accept that she has established that he
      has died.

56    With regard to the matters on which the Appellant  relies  to  suggest
      that life would be difficult in Tanzania, I do  not  accept  that  the
      Appellant has established to the  required  standard  that  she  would
      encounter difficulties in freedom  of  movement  from  Zanzibar  (i.e.
      Unguja and Pemba) and the mainland. There is no  documentary  evidence
      before me about any new ID card system, or  its  relevance  to  travel
      within the country, and the Appellant ultimately accepted that she may
      be able to obtain such a card in any event.  I find that the Appellant
      could, if  necessary,  travel  to,  and  live  and  work  in  mainland
      Tanzania. Further, I am  not  prepared,  given  the  Appellant's  past
      deceptions, her lack of candour in these present proceedings, and lack
      of corroborative evidence, to accept her oral evidence that there  are
      no English language state  schools  in  either  mainland  Tanzania  or
      Zanzibar. In any event, I find that it has  been  convenient  for  the
      Appellant to suggest that HSN speaks  only  English,  and  I  find  it
      unlikely that the Appellant would not have spoken  some  Swahili,  the
      Appellant's first language, to HSN whilst she has been growing  up.  I
      find that HSN is likely to have  some  understanding  of  Swahili  and
      would be able to learn the language within a reasonable period of time
      if residing in Tanzania.





      Conclusions

57    The  consequence  of  the  Respondent's  refusal  of  the  Appellant's
      application for leave to remain and refusal of her human rights  claim
      is that the Appellant and HSN have no leave to remain in  the  UK  and
      will stand to be removed from the United Kingdom  to  the  country  of
      their  nationality,  Tanzania.  Such  removal,  together,  raises   no
      question of a breach of family life between them. They have no  family
      life with HSN's father.

58    However, I accept that their  removal  engages  the  question  of  the
      proportionality of any interference with their private lies in the UK.
      In respect of HSN, I find that the requirements of para  276ADE(1)(iv)
      are not met;  quite  aside  from  the  requirement  it  would  not  be
      reasonable to expect HSN to leave  the  UK  (a  question  to  which  I
      return, below), the rule requires HSN to have  lived  continuously  in
      the UK for at least 7 years at the date of application. This  was  not
      the case.

59    Further, in relation  to  the  Appellant's  entitlement  to  leave  to
      remain under para 276ADE(1)(vi), the  Appellant  has  been  on  notice
      since the hearing before  Judge  Parker  (see  the  Judge's  decision,
      paragraph 27) that the Respondent raised the question of  whether  the
      Appellant met the suitability requirements for entitlement to leave to
      remain on the grounds  of  private  life.  Judge  Pickup  was  clearly
      correct in finding that Judge Parker erred in law in  suggesting  that
      276ADE(1) was not subject to suitability requirements;  it  is  -  see
      276ADE(1)(i), which requires that the applicant  "does  not  fall  for
      refusal under any of the grounds in Section S-LTR 1.2  to  S-LTR  2.3.
      and S-LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5. in Appendix FM".

60    Those provisions  provide, insofar as relevant to the present  appeal:



           "S-LTR.1.1. The applicant  will  be  refused  limited  leave  to
           remain on grounds of suitability if any of paragraphs S-LTR.1.2.
           to 1.8. apply.

           S-LTR.1.6. The presence of  the  applicant  in  the  UK  is  not
           conducive to the public good because  their  conduct  (including
           convictions which do not fall within  paragraphs  S-LTR.1.3.  to
           1.5.),  character,  associations,  or  other  reasons,  make  it
           undesirable to allow them to remain in the UK.

           S-LTR.1.7. The applicant has failed without reasonable excuse to
           comply with a requirement to-

                 (a)   attend an interview;
                 (b)   provide information;
                 (c)   provide physical data; or
                 (d)   undergo a medical examination or  provide  a  medical
                 report.



           S-LTR.2.1. The applicant will normally be refused on grounds  of
           suitability if any of paragraphs S-LTR.2.2. to 2.5. apply.

           S-LTR.2.2. Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -

                 (a)   false information, representations or documents  have
                       been  submitted  in  relation  to   the   application
                       (including false information submitted to any  person
                       to  obtain  a  document  used  in  support   of   the
                       application); or

                 (b)   there has been a failure to disclose  material  facts
                                  in relation to the application.

           S-LTR.4.2. The  applicant  has  made  false  representations  or
           failed to disclose any material fact in a  previous  application
           for entry clearance, leave  to  enter,  leave  to  remain  or  a
           variation of leave, or in a previous human rights claim; or  did
           so in order to obtain from the Secretary of  State  or  a  third
           party a document required to  support  such  an  application  or
           claim (whether or not the application or claim was successful).

           S-LTR.4.3.   The   applicant   has   previously    made    false
           representations or failed to disclose  material  facts  for  the
           purpose of obtaining a document from the Secretary of State that
           indicates that he or she has a right to  reside  in  the  United
           Kingdom.

61    The Appellant's most recent application for leave to remain,  i.e.  on
      9.9.14 for ILR as a person having  had  refugee  leave  for  5  years,
      contained an explicit or implied assertion that she was a refugee. She
      was not. Therefore, both in her current application, and in  her  past
      applications, for entry clearance, and for asylum, the  Appellant  has
      made false representations. I find that the  Respondent  has  met  the
      burden  of  establishing  the  precedent  fact  of   the   Appellant's
      deceptions (see JC (Part 9 HC395, burden of proof) China [2007]  UKAIT
      00027). I further find that there are no sufficient reasons as to  why
      the presumption in S-LTR2.2 and 2.3 (with reference to S-LTR 2.1) that
      the applicant's application for leave  to  remain  would  normally  be
      refused on grounds of suitability,  is  displaced.  I  find  that  the
      Appellant fails to meet the suitability requirements that are imported
      into 276ADE(1).

62    Further and in any event, I find, with reference  to  my  findings  of
      fact at paras 49-56 above that the Appellant has not established  that
      there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  her  integration  in
      Tanzania were she to be required to leave the  UK.  I  find  that  the
      Appellant has purposely downplayed her prospects of gaining employment
      in Tanzania. She claims, essentially, to  be  overqualified  and  that
      there would no market for her skills.  However, in  this  regard,  she
      made specific reference to Zanzibar. I find that  there  would  be  no
      significant obstacle to  the  Appellant  living  and  working  in  the
      mainland of Tanzania. Further, I find that the  Appellant  could  live
      and work in Zanzibar, and live in her mother's property for any period
      whilst she set herself up in employment  either  in  Zanzibar  or  the
      mainland. Her mother's rental income from the  property  is  $600  per
      year. I find that the Appellant has not  established  that  she  would
      not, from her salary of �22,665 per year in the UK, be able  to  bring
      with her to Tanzania sufficient funds to support herself  and  to  pay
      rent to her mother, if demanded, for a sufficient period in  which  to
      obtain gainful employment in Tanzania.

63    In relation the private life interests of the Appellant and HSN  under
      Article 8 ECHR outside of the rules, I find, by a narrow margin  only,
      that it would be in HSN's best interests to remain in the UK. This  is
      because the UK is the place which HSN is familiar; she has  lived  her
      whole life here.  There  is  at  least  some  clarity  of  what  HSN's
      educational future might hold in the UK,  whereas  there  is,  at  its
      highest, uncertainty as to what that future  may  be  in  Tanzania.  I
      accept that for HSN, the prospect of leaving a country  which  she  is
      familiar with,  and likely treats as her home,  and  travelling  to  a
      country that she has only visited as an infant, but not lived in,  may
      seem daunting and unsettling, and that this uncertainty is  likely  to
      cause HSN some distress.

64    I consider the various factors set  out  in  EV  (Philippines)  [2014]
      EWCA Civ 874. Acknowledging the time spent by HSN in the  UK,  I  have
      found above that she is not at any critical stage of her education.  I
      find that although she has not lived in Tanzania, she will  have  some
      familiarity, from her mother, with the cultural norms in that country,
      and for the avoidance of doubt I find that the Appellant  has  in  her
      evidence purposely downplayed HSN's familiarity with  and  connections
      to Tanzania. There are family members in Tanzania with  whom  HSN  may
      have a family life; her grandmother, an aunt and an uncle (even if not
      all living in the same location). She has no family in the UK. She has
      no medical issues which I have been told of.

65    I have held above that  the  Appellant  has  failed  to  establish  by
      corroborative evidence  (her  own  testimony  not  being  sufficiently
      reliable on this point) that there would in fact  be  any  educational
      disadvantage, significant or otherwise, to HSN, if they were  to  both
      return to Tanzania, to either the mainland or to  Zanzibar.  The  fact
      that the Appellant is herself educated to a high standard, her  mother
      is a retired teacher, her brother in law is presently a  teacher,  and
      her brother has good prospects of becoming a teacher, means that  this
      family would be in a good position in Tanzania to  know  how  to  best
      utilise the education system that exists there. I find that  there  is
      no reliable evidence that there would be deleterious  consequences  to
      HSN if required to live in Tanzania (EV (Philippines) para 36).

66    I take into account that the Appellant is engaged in employment  which
      is beneficial to her patients. However, I find that, in  balancing  on
      the one hand the private life of the Appellant and HSN, and HSN's best
      interests, and on the other the maintenance  of  immigration  control,
      the Appellant's past deceptions and immigration  history.  It  is  not
      overwhelmingly in HSN's child's best interests  that  she  should  not
      return Tanzania.

67     I  accept,  applying  s.117B  NIAA  2002,  that  the   Appellant   is
      financially independent and speaks English. (I do  not  count  against
      her that she receives CTC/WTC. The Appellant earns more than  the  sum
      deemed adequate under Appendix for even a couple with one  child,  and
      many families earning over the sums specified  in  Appendix  FM  might
      still be entitled to CTC/WTC.) However, the positive  satisfaction  of
      s.117B(2)and (3) do not bring a positive entitled to leave to remain -
       AM (S.117B) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC).

68    Further, I find that any private life developed by the  Appellant  and
      HSN in the UK has been developed whilst present precariously, as  such
      leave was gained by deception (ibid) and thus is to  be  given  little
      weight (s.117B(5)) although I attach some weight to it (Treebhawon and
      Others (NIAA 2002 Part 5A - compelling circumstances test:  Mauritius)
      [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC) headnote no 2).

69    In Treebhawon [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC), the Tribunal was also  obliged  to
      apply the reasoning in MA (Pakistan) (see para 48  above).  I  do  not
      simply consider  the  best  interests  of  HSN,  but  the  Appellant's
      immigration history as a whole. I find, applying s.117B(6) NIAA  2002,
      that whilst HSN has, at the date of hearing, been living  continuously
      in the UK for more than 7 years, (and I find that  that  is  a  matter
      deserving of some weight), it has not been shown, taking into  account
      all the circumstances of the case, that it would not be reasonable  to
      expect her to leave the UK.

70    Therefore, whilst I accept  that  the  Appellant  has  a  genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship with HSN, HSN  is  not  a  qualifying
      child as per s.117D NIAA 2002, and s.117B(6) does not  establish  that
      it is not in the public interest to remove the Appellant.

71    The removal of the Appellant and HSN from  the  United  Kingdom  would
      not, I find, amount  to  a  disproportionate  and  therefore  unlawful
      interference with their right to private life in the UK. There are  no
      compelling circumstances justifying allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
      under Article 8 ECHR outside the rules.

      Decision

72    I remake the decision, by dismissing the appeal.


      Direction


      As this decision relates to the welfare of a child, Pursuant  to  Rule
      14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269)
      I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a  Court
      directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
      publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original
      appellant. This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any
      failure to comply with this direction could give rise to  contempt  of
      court proceedings. We do so in order to avoid a likelihood of  serious
      harm arising to the appellant from  the  contents  of  his  protection
      claim.





Signed:                           Date: 14.8.17
