Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Islam, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Sudan and is accepted as being a  member
    of the Berti tribe.  He arrived in this country on August 29, 2018  and
    claimed asylum two days later.  The respondent refused his  application
    on March 6, 2019 and the appellant appealed this decision on March  20,
    2019 under Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002.

 2. His appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fowell and in a
    decision promulgated on May 30, 2019 the Judge dismissed his appeal.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    O'Garro on June 28, 2019 who found it was arguable that by  failing  to
    follow the country  guidance  decisions  of  AA  (Non-Arab  Darfuris  -
    relocation) Sudan CG [2009] UKAIT  0056  and  MM  (Darfuris)  Sudan  CG
    [2015] UKUT 00010 the Judge had materially erred.

 4. The matter came before me on the  above  date  and  I  raised  with  Ms
    Pettersen the issue highlighted in the permission to appeal.

 5. In essence, the Judge had dismissed the appeal preferring to follow the
    decision of IM and AI (Risks - membership of Beja Tribe, Beja  Congress
    and JEM) Sudan CG [2016] UKUT 188 as it was the most recent guidance.

 6. In doing so the Judge appeared to have failed to take into account what
    the Tribunal had stated at paragraph 217 of that decision, namely  that
    all non-Arab Darfuris remained at a risk of persecution  following  the
    earlier country guidance cases and that the appellants in the  case  of
    IM and AI were not Darfuri.

 7. Ms Pettersen accepted that the Judge's  approach  overlooked  the  fact
    that non-Arab Dafuris remained at risk per se in light of the 2009  and
    2015 country guidance cases and that the Tribunal made clear in IM  and
    AI that the approach in AA and MM was still to be followed.

 8. Having identified that there was an error in law I did not require  any
    further submissions from either representative.  It was  accepted  that
    as there was an error of law the decision would have to  be  set  aside
    and following the two country guidance cases  this  appellant's  appeal
    should be allowed on protection grounds and under Article 3 ECHR.

    NOTICE OF DECISION

 9. I set aside the original decision and allow the  appeal  on  protection
    grounds and under Article 3 ECHR.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
