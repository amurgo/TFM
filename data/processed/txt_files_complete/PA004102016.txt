                                  DECISION

 1. Errors of law in the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (the  "FtT")
    have, correctly, been  acknowledged  by  Mr  Bates  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent.  The only issue argued was that of materiality.

 2. I conclude that the decision of the  FtT  suffers  from  the  following
    infirmities:

      a) The Tribunal failed to give consideration to, much less apply,  the
         operative Country Guidance decision of the Upper  Tribunal,  namely
         FA (Libya) [2016] UKUT 00413.  Rather,  the  Tribunal,  mistakenly,
         gave consideration to what it characterised "the relevant case"  of
         AT and Others [2014] UKUT 318  which  was  expressly  described  as
         "unreliable" in [11] of FA (Libya).

      b) The Tribunal failed to take into account the relevant  Home  Office
         "CIG", published in June 2016.

      c) The Tribunal failed to  make  concrete  findings  relating  to  the
         Appellant's assertions of political  involvement  and  journalistic
         activities  and,  in   consequence,   failed   to   give   adequate
         consideration of the Appellant's personal circumstances.

      d) The Tribunal failed to assess the issue of internal relocation.

 3. The materiality of these errors of  law,  whether  individually  or  in
    combination, cannot be gainsaid.  Any  suggestion  that  they  made  no
    difference to the outcome is manifestly untenable.

Decision

 4. On these grounds:

      i) I set aside the decision of the FtT.

     ii) I remit the appeal to  a  differently  constituted  FtT  for  fresh
         decision.

    iii) I preserve no findings of fact.





                                               THE HON. MR JUSTICE MCCLOSKEY
                                             PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
