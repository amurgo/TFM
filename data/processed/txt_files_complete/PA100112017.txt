                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I continue the anonymity direction that  was  made  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. This is an appeal by MD against a decision of Judge Swaney  to  dismiss
    the appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal of  his  protection
    claim.

 3. The appellant is a Turkish national who  was  aged  16  years  when  he
    arrived in the United Kingdom. The essence of his claim was  that  both
    he and his father were  supporters  whilst  in  Turkey  of  the  Halkin
    Democratic Party (HDP).  His father had been detained and  tortured  in
    2013 because of his political activities  and,  following  his  release
    from detention, he left home. The Appellant has  not  seen  him  since.
    His mother informed him that his father was  in  hiding.  The  Jandarma
    occasionally visited the Appellant's home to ask where his father was.

 4. So far as the Appellant's own experiences were concerned, his claim can
    be summarised as follows.  He had been detained  on  two  occasions  in
    Turkey.  The first was on 20th June 2016 when he was handing  out  HDP
    leaflets with friends.  The Jandarma saw them and  stopped  them.   The
    Appellant was fingerprinted,  photographed,  and  questioned.   He  was
    asked about his father. His interrogator said they knew his father  had
    joined the PKK  and  accused  the  Appellant  of  supporting  it.   The
    Appellant was beaten with truncheons and questioned on  four  occasions
    whilst being detained for two days.  He was released without charge but
    told that if he was found to be involved in politics in the future they
    would kill him.

 5. The second detention occurred on 2nd December 2016.  On  that  occasion
    the Jandarma raided the family  house  in  the  early  morning  because
    someone had informed them that the residents were helping the PKK.  The
    Jandarma asked as to the whereabouts of the Appellant's father and took
    the Appellant in his  stead.   On  this  occasion,  the  Appellant  was
    detained for 24 hours, during which time he  was  interrogated,  beaten
    and tortured.  He was asked about PKK activities in  the  village.  The
    Appellant denied any knowledge or involvement.

 6. Following his release, the  Appellant  was  required  to  sign  at  the
    Gendarme Station every week.  He signed three times and was  beaten  on
    each occasion.  He therefore left Turkey, with the  assistance  of  his
    uncle.  His mother has told him that the  Jandarma  have  been  to  the
    house twice since he left, asking questions about him and  his  father.
    As a result, his mother is afraid to remain in the family home and  has
    since moved to live with her brother.

 7. The judge made mixed credibility findings, accepting some parts of  the
    account I have just summarised and rejecting others.  He accepted  that
    the Appellant was Kurdish, a supporter of the HDP when in  Turkey,  and
    that he had been detained on two occasions by the Jandarma.  He did not
    however accept the Appellant's  account  of  being  tortured  on  those
    occasions, specifically rejecting his claim that he had been  subjected
    to electric shocks.  His reasoning begins at paragraph 55 -

         In respect of his first detention the Appellant stated at interview
         and in his oral  evidence  that  he  was  detained  for  the  first
         occasion while distributing leaflets  and  that  he  was  taken  to
         Sakcagozu Station.  At interview he stated he was released after 24
         hours because there was no evidence against him.  He was not  asked
         about his treatment during his detention but at questions 94 and 95
         of the interview he stated he was beaten and  subject  to  electric
         shocks during his detention.  He was not  specific  as  to  whether
         this was during the first, second or both periods of detention.  In
         his statement however he  states  that  he  was  taken  to  Nurdagi
         Station when he was detained for the first time  and  that  he  was
         released after two days.  In his statement the Appellant states  he
         was beaten with truncheons all  over  his  body  during  his  first
         detention but does not mention being subject to electric shocks.

    56.  In respect  of  his  second  detention  the  Appellant  stated  at
         interview and in his oral evidence that he was  detained  from  his
         home and that he was taken to Nurdagi Station.  He was  very  clear
         about this in his oral evidence.  In his statement he  stated  that
         he was taken to Sakcagozu Station and that he was detained for more
         than 24 hours.  Also in  his  statement  he  said  he  was  beaten,
         interrogated and tortured.

    57.  I prefer the evidence the Appellant gave at interview and  at  the
         hearing.  This evidence was consistent.  I place less weight on the
         Appellant's statement dated 14th March 2017.  Although it contains
         a declaration from the  interpreter  to  the  effect  that  it  was
         faithfully and accurately  translated  to  the  Appellant  and  the
         Appellant has signed it I have some concerns about its content.  In
         my view it is not written in the words of a 16ï¿½ year old child with
         limited education.  The language used is  much  more  sophisticated
         than the language the Appellant used at interview or  in  his  oral
         evidence.  It appears to me that it was drafted on the  Appellant's
         behalf and does not use his words.  I find it is  likely  that  the
         inconsistency in the statement regarding the place of detention  is
         an error on the part of the person drafting the statement  and  was
         not appreciated by the Appellant.

 8. Beginning again at paragraph 59, the judge said this -

         The Appellant's other evidence about his detention was  consistent.
         He stated  that  he  was  questioned  about  the  leaflets  he  was
         distributing and that he was asked  where  he  got  them.   He  was
         questioned about his  father  and  his  father's  activities.   The
         Appellant was told that the  authorities  suspect  his  father  was
         involved with the PKK and they also suspected him  of  involvement.
         He stated on each occasion he was  photographed  and  fingerprinted
         but that he was released due to lack of evidence.

    60.  The Appellant's evidence about his detention on two  occasions  is
         consistent with the background evidence.  The Respondent is of  the
         view that ordinary members of  the  HDP  have  not  generally  been
         specifically targeted by the Turkish authorities.  She acknowledges
         however that they have come to the attention of the authorities  it
         has  been  while  participating  in  demonstrations  and   rallies.
         Although the Appellant did not state  he  was  participating  in  a
         demonstration or a rally he stated that the  meetings  he  attended
         took place outside and were attended by 500 to 600 people.  This in
         my view could appropriately have been termed a rally rather than  a
         meeting.  The Appellant's evidence is that the first time  he  came
         to the attention of the authorities he was handing out leaflets  in
         the village with some friends.  He does not specifically  state  it
         was at a meeting or a rally but it was in a public  place  and  his
         evidence was that the Jandarma  were  present  and  observed  them.
         Having come to their attention he was detained and questioned about
         possible links to the PKK.  This too is consistent with  background
         country information which confirms the Turkish authorities view the
         HDP as a political offshoot of the PKK.

    61.  I accept that in the context  of  Kurdish  political  activity  in
         Turkey a level of harassment by the authorities and even arrest and
         detention are commonplace.  I find  that  it  is  not  confined  to
         members with a high  profile.   This  is  supported  by  background
         evidence (for example Office of the UN High Commissioner for  Human
         Rights Report dated February 2017, cited in  the  CPIN  on  Kurdish
         parties dated August 2017).

    62.  For these reasons I find to the lower standard the  Appellant  was
         detained on two occasions as claimed".

 9. The judge thus carefully explained why he accepted certain parts of the
    Appellant's account by reference not only to his evidence, but also  to
    background country information  that  supported  it.   The  judge  then
    turned to the reasons  why  he  rejected  other  parts  his  account  -



    63.  I do not accept the Appellant was tortured in detention.  I accept
         that he may have been treated roughly but I do not accept that  the
         treatment he received was  sufficiently  severe  as  to  reach  the
         threshold of torture or serious harm.  I do not accept that he  was
         subjected to electric shocks.  He referred to  this  only  once  at
         interview and it is not mentioned in his statement.  If true,  this
         would be a significant factor in his claim and I would expect it to
         have been referred in his statements and in more detail during  his
         interview.  Although the Appellant claims to have been  beaten  all
         over his body with truncheons, he does not state that  he  received
         any injuries, much less that he required any medical treatment as a
         result.  If in fact he was beaten more than once during the periods
         he was detained I would expect some reference  to  injuries  albeit
         they may now have healed leaving no lasting evidence.   That  there
         is no such reference, is in my view significant.

    64.  For the same reasons I find the Appellant  was  not  subjected  to
         torture or serious harm when he reported on two or three  occasions
         after he was released from detention.

    65.  The Appellant was released without  any  further  action  on  both
         occasions he was detained because on his evidence he was told there
         was no  evidence  against  him.   The  Appellant  states  that  the
         authorities have visited his home on three  occasions  looking  for
         him since he left, most recently two months ago.   I  do  not  find
         this is plausible.  The Appellant is at best a low level  supporter
         of the HDP.  He does not have a political profile and while he  was
         suspected of involvement in the PKK, the  authorities  acknowledged
         they had no evidence of this.  While I accept the authorities might
         detain a  low  level  supporter  such  as  the  Appellant  if  they
         encountered him again for  example  at  a  rally,  or  distributing
         leaflets, I find it is  implausible  they  would  expend  resources
         coming to look for him notwithstanding that his mother told them he
         is in the United Kingdom.  It is not consistent with the background
         evidence  that  the  authorities  actively  search  out  low  level
         supporters such as the Appellant".

10. The Grounds of Appeal run to some fourteen paragraphs, but  essentially
    contain three grounds.  Firstly, they attack the findings  of  fact  to
    which I have just referred.  Thus, at paragraph  8,  it  is  said  that
    having found the Appellant was detained on both occasions  and  was  an
    active supporter of a left-wing  political  party  in  Turkey,  it  was
    "inherently contradictory to find  that  the  Appellant  was  not  ill-
    treated".  No further explanation  for  this  is  given.   I  therefore
    assume that it is intended to imply that it was not reasonably open  to
    the judge to accept   parts of the Appellant's account whilst rejecting
    others. If that is the implication, then I respectfully disagree.  When
    making mixed credibility findings, it is of  course  incumbent  upon  a
    judge to provide detailed reasons for why the issue of credibility  has
    not been treated indivisibly. It is however clear, from the passages  I
    have quoted above, that this is precisely what the judge did.  He  thus
    drew a distinction between  those  parts  of  the  evidence  that  were
    internally consistent and supported by background country  information,
    and those that were not. I therefore reject the first ground.

11. The second ground claims that the judge failed  to  apply  the  country
    guidance of IK (Returnees - Records - IFA)  Turkey  CG  [2004]  UKIAT
    00312.  That challenge appears at paragraph 12 of the grounds,  wherein
    it lists the factors identified in IK that are said to be applicable to
    this Appellant's case -

      1) family connections with the HDP and links with the PKK;

      2) Kurdish ethnicity;

      3) accepted that the Appellant was ill-treated;

      4) lack of a current Turkish passport;

      5) family emanate from the south east of Turkey where  the  separatist
         conflict had generally been at its most acute;

      6)  imputed  political  opinion  on  the  part  of  the  father   (not
         addressed);

      7) an active supporter of left wing Kurdish parties;

      8) accepted that he was an active supporter of  the  Kurdish  parties;



      9) asked to become an informer;

     10) detained on two occasions;

     11) military service not undertaken.

12. It is immediately apparent that the above list includes claims made  by
    the Appellant which the judge had specifically rejected as  matters  of
    fact.  For  example,  the  judge  rejected  (for  good  and  sufficient
    reasons) the Appellant's claim that he had been ill-treated during  his
    periods of detention (see above).  Furthermore, there does  not  appear
    to have been any evidential basis for suggesting that the Appellant had
    been asked to become an informer.   The  author  of  the  grounds  thus
    appears to have included it simply because it is a factor  referred  to
    in the decision of IK rather than because it had any specific relevance
    to the Appellant's case. The judge moreover specifically addressed  the
    issue  of  the  Appellant  not  having  undertaken  military   service,
    concluding (as he was entitled to do) that the Appellant had  been  too
    young to perform  military  service  when  he  left  Turkey  and  that,
    therefore, he would not have been recorded as a  draft  evader  by  the
    authorities.  The judge also took full account of those  factors  which
    he  did  consider  were  relevant  when  assessing  the  risk  of  this
    particular Appellant returning to Turkey. Thus,  at  paragraph  67,  he
    said this -

         In summary I find the Appellant is Kurdish and that he was  a  low-
         level supporter of the HDP.  I find that he  was  detained  on  two
         occasions and questioned about  his  activities  but  was  released
         without further action due to lack of evidence.  His profile is not
         such that he remains of interest to the authorities.  I  find  that
         there is no real risk that the Appellant would be of  interest  due
         to his past detention or in the alternative if he is the outcome is
         likely to be the  same;  he  would  be  released  due  to  lack  of
         evidence.  He was not  subjected  to  treatment  that  amounted  to
         torture or serious harm and there is no real risk that he would  be
         subject to such treatment on return.

13. Those conclusions were entirely consistent with the  judge's  evidence-
    based findings of fact as set out above.  Furthermore, as was made very
    clear at paragraph 47 of the decision  in  IK,  the  factors  that  are
    listed therein are not in any event to  be  treated  as  some  kind  of
    checklist.  The assessment of a claim is necessarily fact-specific, and
    all relevant matters must therefore be considered in  the  round.   The
    central issue, as always, is whether there is a real risk on return  of
    ill-treatment amounting to persecution or breach of a person's  Article
    3 rights. That issue was  fully  and  appropriately  addressed  by  the
    judge.

14. Finally, the grounds claim that the judge erred by failing to  consider
    what they claim is the "current situation in Turkey". It is  said  that
    there is currently a State of Emergency in Turkey that would result  in
    the Appellant being detained and questioned on arrival, and  thereafter
    to his background being checked.  It is thus said to be  reasonable  to
    believe that the Appellant's own history, and that of his family, would
    come to light and lead to his ill-treatment on return. There is however
    no suggestion in the grounds that this argument was  canvassed  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal, let alone that there was any evidence  to  support
    it. I therefore find it to be without merit.
