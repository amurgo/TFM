For the Appellant:           No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against  the  17th  January  2018
    decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Kainth)  to  dismiss  his
    protection appeal.


 2. The Appellant did not attend the hearing and nor was he represented.  I
    was informed by  the  clerk  that  Duncan  Lewis  Solicitors,  who  had
    previously been instructed, had come off the record.   I noted that the
    Notice of Hearing had been sent to the Appellant's last known  address,
    the same address held on the Home Office file. I put the matter to  the
    end of the list and asked that enquiries be made. The clerk was  unable
    to get hold of the Appellant and confirmed that he  had  not  contacted
    the Tribunal. By 12.30 I was satisfied that the Appellant was not going
    to attend the hearing, and there being no reason advanced for his  non-
    attendance decided to proceed in his absence.
    Anonymity Order


 3. This appeal concerns a claim for international protection.  Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Background and Matters in Issue


 4. The Appellant claims to have been in the  United  Kingdom  since  April
    2012 when he entered the country in a  lorry.  He  was  encountered  by
    police officers on the 20th March 2016 but absconded. He claimed asylum
    on the 1st  September  2017  after  being  apprehended  by  Immigration
    Officers.


 5. The basis of the Appellant's claim for protection is a fear of criminal
    gangs in Vietnam. He told officers that he is from a fishing family  in
    Nghe An. He was working as a shoe shine on the streets of the  regional
    capital, Vinh, when he met a man named T. T suggested to  him  that  he
    could make more money working in restaurants in the UK and  offered  to
    arrange this. T said that he would pay for the Appellant's journey, and
    that the Appellant would pay him back from his earnings  once  in  this
    country.  T later informed the Appellant that the total cost  would  be
    �24,000, plus �3000 interest.  Once the Appellant arrived in the UK  he
    was put to work in a basement of a warehouse,  kept  in  captivity  and
    threatened with death if he challenged this arrangement.   He was  able
    to escape in May/June 2013. He has no means  of  'repaying'  the  Triad
    gang whom he now understands T to have represented, and fears that they
    will kill him/otherwise do him serious harm if he were to  be  returned
    to Vietnam.


 6. In her letter of the 24th November 2017  the  Respondent  rejected  the
    account,  having  identified  a  number  of  inconsistencies   in   the
    Appellant's  evidence.  She  further  found  that  there  would  be   a
    sufficiency of protection afforded by  the  Vietnamese  authorities  to
    whom the Appellant could turn if he  had  a  fear  of  crime.   If  the
    Appellant did not wish to remain in Vinh for fear of discovery he could
    relocate to one of the many other large cities  in  the  country.   The
    only person in the gang that he ever met, by his own  account,  was  T.
    The Respondent did not accept that T would be able to find and identify
    the Appellant anywhere in Vietnam.  This decision followed from that of
    the Competent Authority  (CA),  dated  24th  October  2017,  which  had
    concluded that there were not 'reasonable grounds' to suppose that  the
    Appellant had been trafficked.




    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 7. Judge Kainth heard live evidence from the Appellant and is partner.  He
    had before him the Appellant's interview record and witness  statements
    prepared by the Appellant's  solicitors.   In  its  assessment  of  the
    Appellant's credibility the Tribunal found  the  following  matters  to
    weigh against him:


              i) His poor immigration history. The  Appellant  escaped  from
                 the police, evaded immigration control,  failed  to  report
                 when required to do so and there was a delay of five  years
                 before he claimed  protection.  He  had  given  varied  and
                 inconsistent evidence about why and how he had  arrived  in
                 the UK;


             ii) He had said that he had been  unaware  of  the  process  of
                 claiming asylum but the Tribunal rejected that, given  that
                 he  had  spent  time   in   the   Jungle   where   it   was
                 "inconceivable" that he had would not  have  learned  about
                 claiming asylum in the UK. Further his partner had  claimed
                 asylum in Germany and then in the UK;


            iii) The Appellant was unable to give  any  details  as  to  the
                 arrangements that the alleged traffickers had enforced upon
                 him  in  respect  of  the  'travel  debt'  and  had   given
                 inconsistent evidence about how and when  he  was  informed
                 that the debt had arisen.


 8. The Tribunal further found that there was, objectively, no risk to  the
    Appellant upon return to Vietnam.  On  his  own  account  he  had  been
    'recruited' for trafficking by one man, T,  who  had  met  him  on  the
    streets of Vinh and made all the necessary arrangements.  The Appellant
    had failed to show that there was a reasonable likelihood of him coming
    into contact with this one man again. If he was concerned  about  doing
    so it remained open to him to relocate  to  one  the  large  cities  in
    Vietnam.  There was no credible evidence that T or his friends would be
    able to  find  the  Appellant  anywhere  in  that  large  country.  The
    Vietnamese  authorities  do  in  general  provide   a   sufficient   of
    protection.  The appeal was therefore dismissed.




    The Challenge


 9. The Appellant submits that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    flawed for material error of law in  the  Tribunal's  approach  to  the
    findings of  credibility.  The  Appellant  submits  that  the  Tribunal
    misapprehended the basis of his claim,  found inconsistency where there
    was none, and failed to give the Appellant credit for  having  given  a
    consistent account that was plausible when considered in the context of
    the country background material.


10. In granting permission to appeal Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Shaerf commented that a number of the  concerns  expressed  by
    Judge Kainth "arguably go nowhere near  the  core  of  the  Appellant's
    claim" as required  by  Chiver  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (10758).




    Discussion and Findings


11. It is striking that the credibility findings made  in  this  case  are,
    primarily,  concerned  with  the  Appellant's  poor   compliance   with
    immigration control.  On the findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  he
    lied and obfuscated about when and how he arrived,  he  absconded  from
    the police and he failed to claim asylum at the earliest possible date.
    All of those matters  were,  in  accordance  with  s.8  of  the  Asylum
    Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004,  matters  that  were
    capable of diminishing the weight to be  attached  to  the  Appellant's
    claim, and in particular his claim that he had  a  subjective  fear  of
    return to Vietnam.   They could not however be  determinative.  It  was
    still incumbent on the Tribunal to consider whether  the  actual  facts
    gave rise to a well-founded fear of harm.  As far as I can see the only
    explicit reference to the account given was at paragraph 34  where  the
    Tribunal addresses the question of the 'travel debt':


         "The appellant was unable to provide  a  satisfactory  answer  with
         respect to when the alleged loan of �24,000 was to  be  discharged,
         over what period of time and what percentage rate the interest was.
         He was unable to explain why �3000 interest had been charged on the
         �24,000 loan when there was no agreement in place to  identify  the
         structure of the repayment..."


12.  With respect I am at a loss to  understand  the  reasoning  here.  The
    objective evidence does not indicate that traffickers and their victims
    negotiate agreements as to the  'structure  of  repayments'.    To  the
    contrary  the  evidence  indicates  that  victims  are  not  given  any
    information about the 'debt' other than the fact that  it  exists.  The
    total to be repaid is invariably a moving target such that  the  victim
    can  never  reach  it,  remaining  in   debt   bondage,   or   slavery,
    indefinitely.


13. That said this is not a decision that I  am  able  to  interfere  with.
    Whatever the deficiencies of the reasoning this was,  for  the  reasons
    articulated in the refusal letter,  and  adopted  by  Judge  Kainth,  a
    protection claim that was bound to fail. The  Competent  Authority  had
    concluded that there were not reasonable grounds to conclude  that  the
    Appellant had been trafficked. In their letter of the 24th October 2017
    they set out several reasons why, including the fact  that  when  first
    encountered in March 2016 the Appellant made no mention of having  been
    trafficked, he had given wildly inconsistent evidence about how long he
    had been in the UK, he had told officers that he had actually  come  to
    the UK for a better standard  of  living,   when  encountered  for  the
    second time in August 2017 he again  failed  to  make  any  mention  of
    trafficking, and even after he had claimed asylum made  no  mention  of
    the alleged exploitation in his screening interview.   His  account  of
    his journey was inconsistent in  each  telling  and  crucially  he  was
    unable to provide any details in respect of the actual work he is  said
    to have undertaken: he could not describe the house where he claims  to
    have been held, or say how many hours he was expected to work  for.  He
    said that he was doing packing work but could not say what  it  was  he
    was packing. He gave inconsistent accounts of how he  escaped.    These
    were the reasons articulated by the CA in a  very  detailed  reasonable
    grounds letter and I am unable to find that this was  a  decision  that
    could be said to  be  irrational:  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v MS (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 594.


14. Furthermore there is nothing in the evidence  or  grounds  to  indicate
    that the overall decision on risk was wrong. Even if the Appellant  was
    recruited by T, and even if - taking the Appellant's claim at its  very
    highest - T was part of a Triad gang in Vinh,   it remains open to  the
    Appellant to go and live somewhere else in Vietnam, a country with many
    large cities and a population of 97 million.  He has not  advanced  any
    reason why it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so.




    Decisions


15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
    law and it is upheld.
