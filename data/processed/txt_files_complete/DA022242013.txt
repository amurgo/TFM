                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    against a Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Traynor promulgated  on
    18th May 2016.

 2. For the purposes of continuity and clarity I shall continue to refer to
    Mr C A-0 as the Appellant and the Secretary of State as the  Respondent
    in this Decision.

 3. This matter first came before me at Field House on 26 November 2015. On
    that occasion I found as follows:-

          1. The Appellant before the First-tier  Tribunal  is  a  Nigerian
             national born on 9th February 1963. He was  appealing  against
             the decision of the Secretary of State taken on  28th  October
             2013 to make a deportation order  against  him  in  accordance
             with the provisions of s.32 of the UK Borders  Act  2007.  The
             decision to deport the Appellant followed a  conviction  of  4
             counts  of  obtaining  property  by  deception,  1  count   of
             obtaining money transfer by deception, 7 counts of dishonesty,
             making false representations to  maintain  himself/another  or
             cause loss to  others/expose  others  to  risk.  He  was  also
             convicted on 1 count of obtaining exemption from liability  by
             deception,  15  counts   of   making   false   statements   or
             representations to obtain benefit or payment and  1  count  of
             obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception. He  was  sentenced
             to a period of 12 months imprisonment for those  offences.  He
             had previously amassed convictions  in  relation  to  motoring
             offences, usually involving alcohol.

          2. The Judge  noted  in  his  decision  that  the  Appellant  was
             originally granted leave to enter the UK in 1988 in  order  to
             visit his daughter but overstayed. He was removed from the  UK
             in 1990 as an overstayer and claims to have returned  at  some
             point in the same year, remaining unlawfully ever since.

          3. The Judge set out in full the sentencing Judge's  remarks  and
             he then, from paragraph 9 to paragraph 27  inclusive,  recited
             case law relating to Article 8 and deportation. He then  noted
             that  the  Appellant  was  appealing  on  the  basis  of   his
             relationship with a 13-year-old British child and argued  that
             it would not be in the child's best interests for  him  to  be
             deported. The Judge then set out  the  Appellant's  case  from
             paragraph 32 to 89 and the Respondent's case  from  paragraphs
             90 to 97. He then set out the submissions in some  detail  and
             his findings start of paragraph 112 leading to his  conclusion
             in paragraph 126  to  allow  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that
             deportation would breach both the Appellant's  and  his  son's
             Article 8 rights.

          4. Permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary of State  by
             the First-tier Tribunal on the basis that it was arguable that
             the Judge had erred  in  failing  to  take  into  account  the
             Immigration Rules in  relation  to  deportation  and  also  in
             failing to adopt the correct approach when considering how the
             child's best interests weighed against the public interest.

          5. It is true to say that nowhere in the  Decision  and  Reasons,
             where the judge set out the law or  in  his  findings  has  he
             referred at all to the Immigration Rules. Paragraphs  398  and
             399 of the Immigration Rules, we  are  told  by  MF  (Nigeria)
             [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, are a complete code for the purposes  of
             deportation and Article 8. The correct starting point is for a
             Judge to consider those  paragraphs  and  in  accordance  with
             paragraph 398 if an Appellant  cannot bring himself within one
             of the exceptions contained in paragraph 399 it will  only  be
             where  there  are  very  compelling  circumstances  that   his
             circumstances outweigh the  public  interest  in  deportation.
             Consideration of the  compelling  circumstances  involves  the
             Article 8 considerations as described in case law and  as  set
             out in section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
             Act 2002.

          6. It is unarguable therefore that the Judge  has  erred  in  his
             approach  by  failing  to  take  into  account  at   all   the
             Immigration Rules. However, Mr Lee argued that the  error  was
             one of form not substance.  The  Judge  has  in  his  findings
             concluded  that  the  Appellant   had   a   genuine   parental
             relationship with his son and then asked himself  whether  the
             effect of deportation on his son would be  unduly  harsh.  The
             child, not living with his father but  with  his  mother  from
             whom the Father is estranged, there  is  no  question  of  his
             going to Nigeria with the Appellant. Mr Lee  argued  therefore
             that in applying  his  findings  the  Judge  asked  the  right
             question. Section 117, which the Judge did  consider,  mirrors
             exactly the Immigration Rules and therefore had he applied the
             facts, as he found them to be, to the  Immigration  Rules  the
             outcome would have been the same.

          7. That submission would have found favour were it  not  for  the
             fact that I find the Judge also erred in his consideration  of
             whether deportation would be unduly harsh. That is because the
             case of KMO (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria  [2015]  UKUT
             00543 (IAC) makes  clear  that  the  Immigration  Rules,  when
             applied in  the  context  of  the  deportation  of  a  foreign
             criminal, are a complete code. Where an assessment is required
             to be made as to whether a person meets  the  requirements  of
             paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules, as that  comprises  an
             assessment of that person's claim under Article 8 of the ECHR,
             it is necessary to have regard, in making that assessment,  to
             the matters to which  the  Tribunal  must  have  regard  as  a
             consequence of the provisions of section 117C. In  particular,
             these include the more  serious  the  offence  committed,  the
             greater is the public interest in  deportation  of  a  foreign
             criminal. Therefore, the word "unduly" in the  phrase  "unduly
             harsh" requires consideration of whether, in the light of  the
             seriousness of the offences committed by the foreign  criminal
             when the public interest considerations come  into  play,  the
             impact on the  child,  children  or  partner  of  the  foreign
             criminal being deported is inordinately or excessively harsh.

          8. At no time in his  consideration  of  whether  the  effect  of
             deportation would be unduly harsh on the child has  the  Judge
             made any reference to the seriousness of the offence.  Rather,
             the judge assessed "unduly harsh" purely on the basis  of  the
             child without looking at it through the lens of the gravity of
             the offence.

          9. For that reason I find the judge has made  an  error  of  law.
             Given that his findings as to the effect of deportation on the
             child were determinative of this appeal the error was  clearly
             material and the decision must be set aside  in  its  entirety
             and reheard de novo.

         10. I note that this was an appeal that had been remitted from the
             Upper Tribunal to be reheard in the First-tier. Having had two
             substantive  hearings  in  the  First-tier,  I   consider   it
             inappropriate to remit it once more and therefore having found
             an error of law I adjourn this case for a resumed  hearing  in
             the Upper Tribunal when the appeal will be heard afresh. I  do
             not preserve any of the findings of the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. As indicated above the Appellant has at all times been  in  the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully. His first visit (when he was here lawfully only for
    the duration of his visit visa) was for the purposes  of  visiting  his
    daughter Elizabeth. During his  time  in  the  UK  he  entered  into  a
    relationship with a woman with whom he had a child,  Marilyn.  He  said
    that was the reason he did not leave  the  United  Kingdom  because  he
    wanted to remain with his  daughter  Elisabeth  and  his  new  daughter
    Marilyn.

 5. There were problems with Marilyn's mother  and  sometime  in  1997  her
    mother took her to Nigeria and the Appellant then says he was  told  in
    around 1999 that Marilyn had died. He claims that this caused him to be
    depressed and to drink heavily and he blames that for his various drink
    related convictions.

 6. In 1999 he was in a relationship with another lady and as a  result  of
    that relationship his son J was born on 15 September 2000.

 7. The Appellant's relationship with J's mother has never been  stable  or
    settled and they do not live together as a family. The  Appellant  says
    that he nevertheless has a close relationship and a  strong  bond  with
    his son and sees him on a regular basis. He says that  he  remained  in
    contact with both J and his adult daughter Elizabeth whilst  in  prison
    and it is his case that it would be to unduly harsh on his son J if  he
    were deported to Nigeria

 8. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant. He told me  that  J  was  not
    present to give evidence because he attended boarding school. He  is  a
    talented footballer and is at a football academy. He told me  that  his
    son knew about the most recent criminal convictions but not the earlier
    ones. He said that he has always endeavoured to make sure J grows up to
    be a good child. He was sad about his own convictions but he was  going
    through a difficult time. He explained that  since  2014  he  has  been
    unable to work and so has no money.  As a result, since  that  time  he
    has been supported by his daughter Elisabeth and friends.  What  little
    money he does have he uses to go to visit his son at weekends but it is
    not as frequently as before, partly because his son is now at  boarding
    school and partly because of lack  of  money.  J  started  at  boarding
    school in September 2015.

 9. He agreed with the comment by the social worker that J's mother left it
    up to J to decide when and how often to meet with his father.  He  said
    that talking to his son  via  Skype  or  other  electronic  means  from
    Nigeria  would  not  be  the  same  or  as  effective  as  face-to-face
    discussions.

10. The Appellant was asked about whether J would be able to visit  him  in
    Nigeria and he said he did not know. He did not think it likely that he
    would have enough money to pay for visits and he did not  know  whether
    J's mother would allow him to travel. He was certain that it was in J's
    best interests for him to remain in the UK

11. I then heard evidence from the Appellant's  adult  daughter  Elizabeth.
    She confirmed that she lives with her husband, their two  children  and
    the Appellant. Her children are aged three years  and  11  months.  She
    gave evidence  that  her  three-year-old  would  suffer  badly  if  her
    grandfather was no longer around as they get on very well  and  she  is
    very excited whenever he returns home. Also the baby is  very  fond  of
    him. She confirmed that the Appellant goes to visit J whenever  he  can
    and sometimes he takes her daughter with him.  She  also  said  that  J
    regularly comes to the house in the holidays and she said that over the
    last  month  he  visited  three  or  four  times.  She  said  that  the
    relationship between the  Appellant  and  J  is  very  close  and  that
    football is a shared interest. She gave the  opinion  that  J's  mother
    would not travel to Nigeria to facilitate J  having  contact  with  his
    father. She also gave the opinion that it is in J's best interests  for
    the Appellant to remain in the UK.

12. In addition to the oral evidence and witness statements, all of which I
    have taken into account, I was  also  provided  with  a  report  by  an
    independent social worker. That report is very helpful and  appears  to
    be independent and offers an unbiased opinion.

13. The social worker, in her report identifies that she had spoken with  J
    and both of his parents on 25 July 2016. She spoke to J alone and  also
    observed his interaction with his father, all  of  which  was  positive
    indicating that the two have a close and caring  relationship  and  are
    easy in each other's company. She asked J to draw a family map  and  he
    placed his father close to him.

14. She noted that J has  no  learning  needs  or  behaviour  or  emotional
    problems. He is a talented footballer and attends  a  football  academy
    where he is doing well in his studies  and  has  good  positive  social
    bonds.

15. J described his father as always having been present in  his  life  and
    being a positive influence. He did say that he was initially angry that
    his father had remained illegally  in  the  UK  without  trying  to  do
    anything  to  rectify  that  and  was  worried  about   the   potential
    deportation.

16. J's mother confirmed that there was  a  significant  level  of  contact
    between the Appellant and her son, although the  level  of  involvement
    when he was very young  differed  in  her  account  from  that  of  the
    Appellant. However, she indicated that, given J's age,  she  no  longer
    restricted contact and it was up to J to decide how often and  for  how
    long he saw his father.

17. In her analysis the social worker said that there was evidence that the
    Appellant had always had an interest in having contact with his son and
    that he has been caring for him. She found  that  there  was  evidence,
    contrary to what the mother had  said,  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    actively involved in J's early life  as  was  proved  in  the  form  of
    letters and photographs.

18.  She  noted  that  there  is  a  strong  association  between  parental
    imprisonment and adverse outcomes  for  children  particularly  as  the
    Appellant's imprisonment came at a time when his contact with J was  at
    its peak. However, J coped with the separation and  is  doing  well  in
    school with no emotional or behavioural problems as a result.

19. After the Appellant was released from  prison  contact  decreased.  The
    social worker indicates that this was due to J's age group at the  time
    when he would naturally wish to  start  spending  less  time  with  his
    parents and more with his friends and now that he  is  aged  16  he  is
    preparing  towards  independence  and  developing  responsibility.  The
    Appellant's restrictions on work have also impacted on his  ability  to
    take J on age-appropriate activities and outings such that the  quality
    and frequency of contact has suffered.

20. The social worker goes on to say that deportation of a parent can  have
    a significant long-lasting effect on emotional, economic, developmental
    and academic levels. She  noted  that  there  were  however  a  lot  of
    parental  strengths  that  the  Appellant  actively   brings   to   his
    relationship with his son and that the relationship remains active  and
    ongoing and that the interview with J himself indicated that he  has  a
    genuine and significant relationship with the Appellant.

21. The social worker noted that Josh is very concerned about the threat of
    his father's deportation and he feels some burden of responsibility  in
    relation to  that,  knowing  that  the  decision  hinges  on  him.  She
    concluded by saying that J is at a significant stage and  time  in  his
    education and the deportation would  likely  be  an  additional  stress
    factor for him. She opined  that  he  is  likely  therefore  to  become
    withdrawn, hindering on his educational  potential;  impacting  on  his
    ability to focus on his studies and she could see deterioration in  his
    emotional well-being as a consequence.

22. I was also provided with written evidence from J himself confirming all
    of the above; that  he  and  his  father  are  close;  that  electronic
    communication  is  not  a  substitute  for  face-to-face  contact   and
    stressing that he wishes his father to remain in the UK.

My Findings

23. The deportation of foreign national criminals is governed by paragraphs
    398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules. Because  the  Appellant  in  this
    case has been sentenced to a 12 month period  of  imprisonment  he  can
    resist  deportation  if  he  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in  the  UK,
    and is a British citizen (which J is) and it would be unduly harsh  for
    J to live in the UK without his father.

24. The other parts of paragraph 399 are inapplicable. It is accepted  that
    the issue for me to decide in this case is whether it would  be  unduly
    harsh for J to remain without  his  father  in  the  UK.  There  is  no
    question of J going with him to Nigeria. The provisions  of  paragraphs
    398  and  399  are  mirrored  in  section  117C  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  the  section  applicable  to  foreign
    national criminals.

25. How a Tribunal should approach the question of "unduly harsh"  was  the
    subject of the Court of Appeal's deliberations in MM (Uganda) and Anr v
    SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 450. In that decision the court found that "unduly
    harsh" in the Immigration Rules means the same as it  does  in  section
    117C (5). At paragraph 23 and 24 of its judgment the  Court  of  Appeal
    said this:-

         "The context in these cases invites emphasis on  two  factors,  (1)
         the public interest in the removal of foreign criminals and (2) the
         need for  a  proportionate  assessment  of  any  interference  with
         Article 8 rights. In my judgment, with respect, the approach of the
         Upper Tribunal in MAB ignores  this  combination  of  factors.  The
         first of them, the  public  interest  in  the  removal  of  foreign
         criminals, is expressly vouched by Parliament in section 117C  (1).
         Section  117C  (2)  then  provides  (I  repeat  the  provision   of
         convenience):

             "the more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal."

         This steers the tribunals and the  court  towards  a  proportionate
         assessment  of  the  criminal's  deportation  in  any  given  case.
         Accordingly the more pressing the public interest in  his  removal,
         the harder it will be to show that  the  effect  on  his  child  or
         partner will be unduly harsh. Any other  approach  in  my  judgment
         dislocates the "unduly harsh" provisions  from  their  context.  It
         would mean that the question of undue  hardship  would  be  decided
         wholly without regard to  the  force  of  the  public  interest  in
         deportation in the particular case.  But  in  that  case  the  term
         "unduly" is mistaken for  "excessive"  which  imports  a  different
         idea. What is due or undue depends on all  the  circumstances,  not
         merely the impact on the child or partner in a given case.  In  the
         present  context  relevant  circumstances  certainly  include   the
         criminal's immigration and criminal history."

26. It is now well established case law that the best interests of a  child
    must be  a  primary  consideration.  Based  on  all  of  the  evidence,
    including that of J himself and the social worker I have no  difficulty
    in reaching a conclusion that it would be in J's best interests for his
    father to remain in the UK. That however does not necessarily mean that
    his remaining without him would be "unduly harsh".

27. In assessing whether it be unduly harsh, MM tells me that I  must  look
    at all circumstances.

28. I turn first to the Judge's sentencing remarks. The  judge  noted  that
    the Appellant pleaded guilty at the plea and  case  management  hearing
    and was entitled therefore to full credit for those  guilty  pleas.  He
    then went on to say:-

         "The facts are these, most of the counts relate to  the  fraudulent
         obtaining of benefit. The authorities defrauded were the Department
         of Work and Pensions and the local authorities in Enfield, Hounslow
         and Ealing. The frauds began in 2005 and continued until June 2012.
         The benefits involved were jobseekers  allowance,  housing  benefit
         and council tax benefit. Each fraud involved the fraudulent use  of
         a name, date of birth, national insurance number and  on  occasions
         the fraudulent claim that you are a British  national.  During  the
         course of making those representations you  used  another  person's
         birth certificate or a copy of it.  What  you  did  in  effect  was
         hijack  the  identity  of  another  person  for  the  purposes   of
         perpetrating the frauds.

         ..................The total benefit fraudulently  obtained  over  a
         period of seven or 7 � years was �40,647.

         In addition you use similar false particulars to claim social  fund
         crisis loans and in one case a  social  fund  budgeting  loan.  The
         total of those firms was  just  over  �1200  needed  to  make  some
         repayments, the total outstanding is  �548,  again  used  the  same
         fraudulent representations as to your identity.

         Counts 27, 28 and 29 refer to obtaining employment by means of  the
         same false identities."

29. The judge noted that the Appellant would  not  have  been  able  to  be
    employed had it not been for his dishonesty. The judge noted that there
    had been multiple frauds over a significant period of time and that  in
    this Appellant's case there was the serious aggravating factor that  he
    had used another  person's  identity.  He  therefore  handed  down  one
    sentence of 12 months and numerous sentences of six months  all  to  be
    served concurrently, making a total term of imprisonment of 12 months.

30. It was clearly the Judge's opinion that the offending was serious  both
    in the length of time over which the offending took place, the  amounts
    involved and the fact that he had used another's identity.

31. That is not the sum total of this Appellant's offending however.  There
    were a considerable number of convictions prior to that;  between  1997
    and 2008  relating  to  driving  with  excess  alcohol,  driving  while
    disqualified, driving without insurance and possession of a  controlled
    drug. Of those six convictions three led to terms of imprisonment.

32. Before me the Appellant sought to minimise  this  culpability  for  his
    offending by blaming factors going on in his life  at  the  time.  They
    remain as  convictions,  the  fact  that  they  resulted  in  a  prison
    sentences indicates that they were considered  to  be  serious  by  the
    sentencing courts and indeed driving  whilst  under  the  influence  of
    alcohol and without insurance is a serious matter. It  cannot  be  said
    therefore that the offence which led to the  decision  to  deport  this
    Appellant was a "one-off". He was a  regular  and  persistent  offender
    between 1997 and 2012. I recognise of course that the Appellant has not
    committed any offences since his release from prison but  I  also  take
    note of the fact that the Appellant would have been aware that he stood
    at considerable risk of deportation.

33. In addition to the Appellant's offending  behaviour  over  a  sustained
    period of time is the fact that the Appellant has never had  any  right
    to be in the United Kingdom. He has been here unlawfully throughout and
    statute, in the form of section 117 of the 2002 Act  makes  clear  that
    little weight should be given to family life built up at a time when  a
    person is present in the UK unlawfully.

34. It is clear that there is a very significant  public  interest  in  the
    deportation of this Appellant.

35. I turn to the impact that his deportation will have on his son  and  in
    that regard I am mindful of the fact that the Appellant  does  not  and
    has never lived with his son.  His  son  is  clearly  a  well-balanced,
    healthy and talented young man who is doing well at school and  in  his
    football. J is at boarding school and when not at boarding  school  his
    home  is  with  his  mother  which  is  some  distance  away  from  the
    Appellant's  home.  There  is  fairly  frequent  and  regular  contact,
    including staying contact, but as the social worker pointed  out,  this
    has reduced in recent years. This,  as  was  confirmed  by  the  social
    worker, is at the behest of J himself who as he grows older has outside
    interests competing for his time.

36. The social worker suggested that his father's deportation would have  a
    significant impact on J. However, I balance against that the fact  that
    when his father was imprisoned it was at a time when contact was at its
    peak, unlike now. That did not adversely impact  J.  He  is  clearly  a
    resilient young man and with the help and support of  his  school,  his
    mother and his friends together also  with  the  support  of  his  half
    sister, Elizabeth I find that his father's absence will not  be  unduly
    harsh. I  have  no  doubt  he  will  be  upset.  I  fully  accept  that
    communication by electronic means is  no  substitute  for  face-to-face
    contact. It is however very often all a child has with an parent absent
    for a variety of reasons such as a parent working away or parents being
    divorced and living in different parts of the country or,  as  in  this
    case, a child being at boarding school. While it  clearly  is  not  the
    same  as  face-to-face  contact,  modern  means  of  communication  are
    excellent with the existence of things  such  as  Facetime  and  Skype.
    There is the possibility of J visiting his father in Nigeria. I do  not
    accept the suggestion that his mother would prevent his visits  as  she
    seems to be entirely in favour of contact. It  may  happen  irregularly
    but I do not accept that it is impossible.

37. For all of the above  reasons,  assessing  the  effects  on  J  of  his
    father's deportation and taking all matters into account, including his
    father's criminality and immigration history and  taking  into  account
    J's own personality I find it would not be unduly harsh for J to remain
    in the UK without his father. He would remain living with  his  mother,
    where he has always lived. He will remain at  boarding  school  and  he
    will maintain the support of his half-sister.

38. There are no other compelling factors in this case capable of  altering
    that conclusion or the conclusion that the Appellant's  deportation  is
    in the public interest and there are no factors  to  displace  that.  I
    recognise that he has a life with his adult daughter but  that  is  not
    one which would engage any of the exceptions in paragraphs 399A or 399B
    nor would it engage Article 8. Similarly, while I  have  no  doubt  the
    Appellant has a good and close  relationship  with  his  grandchildren,
    with whom he lives, if his relationship with his son cannot defeat  the
    decision to deport him, his relationship with his grandchildren cannot.
    They will no doubt miss him but they have the support of their parents.
