For the Appellants:    Mr Omoniruvbe, Church Street Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are partners. The dependent to  the  Second  Appellant's
    appeal is their daughter, born in  2014.  They  are  all  nationals  of
    Nigeria.

 2. They seek leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  human  rights
    grounds.

 3. These linked appeals came before this Tribunal on the 9th January  2019
    with permission granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Gill  on  the  22nd
    October 2018.  The Appellants sought to  appeal  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Lal) to dismiss their  linked  human  rights
    and protection claims.  In my written decision dated the  17th  January
    2019 I found the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to be  flawed  for
    error of law and I set it, to a limited extent, aside. In this decision
    I begin by replicating the background and  my  decision  on  'error  of
    law'. I then give my decision for final disposal of the appeal.

 4. Although this appeal only relates to the two named appellants and their
    eldest dependent child, the parties before me agreed that it would also
    impact upon a second child born to the family in  December  2018.  This
    child was born after the decisions and appeals were  already  made  and
    underway, so has not hitherto featured in the case.




    Anonymity

 5. There is no reason why the identity of either of the  adult  Appellants
    should be protected. I have however made an order for anonymity because
    the case concerns a minor Appellant,  and  having  had  regard  to  the
    guidance in the Presidential Guidance Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity
    Orders, I am concerned that identification of the adults could lead  to
    the identification of that child. I therefore consider  it  appropriate
    to make the following order in accordance with Rule 14 of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Background and Matters in Issue Before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. As  the  legal  framework,  and  factual  matrix,  applicable  to  each
    Appellant was distinct it is appropriate that I begin by setting  those
    out individually.

    The First Appellant

 7. Ms TO claims to have  entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor  in
    September 2000. It would appear that after the expiry of that visa  she
    remained in the United Kingdom without leave.  In March 2014  she  gave
    birth to a little girl.   Following the birth she made  an  application
    for the child to be recognised as a British citizen, informing the Home
    Office that the  father  was  a  British  national[1].  She  also  made
    representations to  that  effect  in  respect  of  her  own  case,  and
    requested leave to remain on Article 8 grounds. Both applications  were
    rejected - inter alia because the father was not named on  the  child's
    birth certificate - but Ms TO was granted a right  of  appeal.  On  the
    30th April 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hodgkinson) allowed  her
    appeal  on  human  rights  grounds,  finding  that  Ms  TO  enjoyed   a
    substantial private and family life in the United Kingdom and that  her
    removal would be a disproportionate  interference  with  those  Article
    8(1) rights. The Judge found that Ms TO has lived in the United Kingdom
    since she was only just 15; her parents  and  three  siblings  are  all
    British citizens and she has always lived with them. Her dependency  on
    them  includes  financial  and  emotional   reliance.   It   would   be
    disproportionate - and contrary to the  child's  best  interests  -  to
    interfere with these close family relationships now.

 8. It was when Ms TO applied for  this  leave  to  be  extended  that  the
    Respondent realised that she four criminal convictions in this country,
    arising from two prosecutions for dishonesty offences.  One  set  post-
    dated the decision of Judge Hodgkinson.  These were:

    1st Sept 2011      1x possessing  and  controlling  identity  documents
                  with intent

      1x making false representations

      Total sentence of 6 months'  imprisonment  handed  down  by  Woolwich
                  Crown Court

    7th July 2016      1x Perverting the course of justice

      1x Dishonestly making false representations

      Total sentence of 6 months handed down by Bromley Magistrates on  the
                  9th August 2016

 9. The Respondent refused to grant further leave  to  remain  and  instead
    made a Deportation Order against Ms TO. The Order  is  dated  the  30th
    March 2017, and the Respondent's reasons for making it are set  out  in
    his letter dated the 13th October 2017.  The  Respondent  reviewed  the
    history set out above and concluded: "your deportation is conducive  to
    the public good and in the public interest because you are a persistent
    offender...therefore,  in  accordance  with  paragraph   398   of   the
    Immigration Rules, the public interest requires your deportation unless
    an exception to deportation applies. The  exceptions  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules".  These then were the
    matters in issue before the First-tier Tribunal in her case.







    The Second Appellant

10. The Second Appellant Mr AO came to the United Kingdom in  October  2007
    and it appears that he has been here ever since.  It would appear  from
    the Respondent's chronology that during that time Mr AO  has  sometimes
    had leave, and sometimes has not. What is clear  is  that  on  the  4th
    December 2015 he was refused leave to remain on  human  rights  grounds
    and that his appeal against that decision was  subsequently  dismissed,
    in a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Brien  dated  April  2017.
    Mr AO became appeal rights exhausted on the 15th May 2017.  He  claimed
    asylum on the 19th April 2017. The basis of his claim was that he has a
    well-founded fear  of  persecution/serious  harm  in  Nigeria  for  the
    following reasons:

      i)    In December 2016 a fatwa was proclaimed against him;

     ii) He fears persecution because he is a Muslim who  has  converted  to
         Christianity;

    iii) His daughter will be subjected to FGM by his family.

11. The Respondent refused to grant protection  and  this  was  the  matter
    under appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.




    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    The First Appellant

12. The First-tier  Tribunal  found  itself  satisfied  that  Ms  TO  is  a
    "persistent offender". At paragraph 20 of the decision the Judge states
    that "this much is clear from the sentencing remarks of the  Judge"  at
    Bromley Magistrates, who in 2016 described the 2011 offence as  a  "key
    aggravating factor".  The Tribunal noted that all of  this  appellant's
    offences were for dishonesty.

13. At paragraph 22 the determination reads:

         "The Tribunal has considered the human rights element of the  First
         Appellant's case  with  regard  to  the  public  interest  and  the
         Immigration Rules 399-399A.  This  will  be  discussed  in  greater
         detail below because the human  rights  matter  in  so  far  as  it
         relates to the child is common to both Appellants  and  whether  it
         would be reasonable for that child to be removed"

14. Paragraphs 32-40 contain a Razgar framed assessment of  proportionality
    and reference to s.55 of the Borders Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
    2009. The determination concludes that it would be reasonable to expect
    the child to relocate with her parents.




    The Second Appellant

15. In assessing the asylum claim made by Mr AO Judge Lal had regard to the
    earlier decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Brien, taken  in  April
    2017. Although he appears to have been  accepted  that  Mr  AO  is  now
    Christian, Judge O'Brien had rejected Mr AO's claim to  face  religious
    hostility in Nigeria and found this to have been invented in  order  to
    try and avoid removal.  This was Judge Lal's starting  point.  He  then
    assessed the new material. In respect of the fatwa he recorded Mr  AO's
    admission that he had known about the fatwa at the time of the  hearing
    before Judge O'Brien and yet had not mentioned it: as such the Tribunal
    was not prepared to attach any weight to that document. The  FGM  claim
    was similarly unmeritorious. There was no specific threat to the  child
    and "the objective evidence did not disclose such a generalised risk to
    females in Nigeria. It was accepted by the representatives that if  the
    parents chose not to have their daughter undergo the procedure then the
    daughter  would  not  undergo  the  procedure".    There  was  no  risk
    established and  the  appeal  was  therefore  dismissed  on  protection
    grounds.




    The Appellants' Appeals

    The First Appellant

16. In respect of Ms TO it is argued that the Tribunal  misdirected  itself
    and took irrelevant matters into account when it  found  her  to  be  a
    'persistent offender'.

    The Second Appellant

17. Mr AO appeals on the grounds that there was  a  misapplication  of  the
    Devaseelan principles in his case, and that the  decision  contains  an
    error of fact in that he was not in fact aware of  the  fatwa  when  he
    appeared before Judge  O'Brien.   It  is  further  submitted  that  the
    findings on FGM are unsound because the Tribunal was wrong  in  law  to
    look for a 'specific threat'.




    Discussion and Findings on 'Error of Law'

    The Second Appellant

18. The  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  Mr  AO's
    protection claim are brief, but are wholly  sustainable.     Judge  Lal
    was bound to take the findings of Judge O'Brien as his starting  point.
    His finding that the Appellant had known about the fatwa at the time of
    that appeal came from the Appellant's own evidence: see paragraph 16 of
    the determination. The  conclusions  on  the  risk  to  the  child  are
    similarly  free  from  error.   The  Appellants  in  this  appeal  have
    previously asserted that the child is the daughter of  an  unidentified
    British national (thus rendering Ms TO a vulnerable single mother of an
    illegitimate child), and that Mr AO had been  disowned  by  his  family
    because of his decision to convert to Christianity. If  both  of  those
    matters were true, it is very difficult to see how and why  his  family
    could pose any risk to the child, who on the earlier  evidence  is  not
    even a relative of theirs.    In  any  event  the  Tribunal  was  quite
    correct to find a) there has been no specific threat to the  child,  b)
    the decision whether to subject her to FGM lies with her parents and c)
    the evidence is not such to suggest that Yoruba girls will be  forcibly
    subjected to the procedure absent the consent of their  parents.   Even
    if a risk arising from Mr AO's family had been made out,  it  would  of
    course be open to the couple to internally relocate in order  to  avoid
    them, and to seek the sufficient protection of the  Nigerian  state  if
    they considered that necessary. No error of law arises  in  respect  of
    the protection grounds.

19. Whether the findings on Article 8, and the best interests of the child,
    are sustainable largely turns on the outcome of  the  mother's  appeal,
    for which see below.

    The First Appellant

20. I am satisfied that it was not  open  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    conclude that the First Appellant is a 'persistent  offender'  for  the
    reasons that it gives. The fact that the magistrate in 2016 had  regard
    to the fact that she had already been convicted of a crime in 2011 does
    not make her conduct "persistent". Nor  does  the  fact  that  on  each
    occasion she was convicted of a dishonesty offence.  Neither was a good
    reason to find that she met the definition.  A 'persistent offender' is
    someone who keeps  on  breaking  the  law:   Chege  ("is  a  persistent
    offender")  [2016]  UKUT  187  (IAC).   Ms  TO  was  convicted  on  two
    occasions, five years apart.   I am  satisfied  that  the  language  of
    "persistence" imports a requirement of repetition greater than that. If
    parliament had intended the provision to apply to someone who  receives
    more than one conviction it could simply have used the  term  'repeat'.
    See Chege at paragraph 54:

         "54. Plainly, a persistent  offender  is  not  simply  someone  who
         offends more than once. There has to be repeat offending  but  that
         repetition,  in  and  of  itself,  will  not  be  enough  to   show
         persistence. There has to be a history of repeated criminal conduct
         carried out over a sufficiently long period to  indicate  that  the
         person concerned is someone who  keeps  on  re-offending.  However,
         determining whether the offending  is  persistent  is  not  just  a
         mathematical exercise. How long a period and how many offences will
         be enough will depend very much on the facts of the particular case
         and the nature and circumstances of  the  offending.  The  criminal
         offences need not be the same, or even of  the  same  character  as
         each other. Persistence may be shown by  the  fact  that  a  person
         keeps committing the same type of offence, but it  may  equally  be
         shown by the fact that he has committed a wide variety of different
         offences over a period of time.

21. The fact that the Appellant had been convicted once before did not make
    her conduct 'persistent' within the meaning of the Act.

22. I am therefore satisfied that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    in respect of the deportation of Ms TO must be set aside.  For the sake
    of completeness I would add that the determination contains a discrete,
    but ultimately immaterial, error in the Tribunal's self-direction,  and
    ensuing analysis, about whether it would be "reasonable" to expect this
    child to leave the United Kingdom with her parents. If, as the Tribunal
    found, the Appellant met the definition of  "persistent  offender"  and
    her deportation was thereby conductive to the public good, the Tribunal
    next had to determine whether any of the exceptions in 399 or 399A were
    met. On the facts they plainly were not, since the  child  in  question
    was not 'qualifying' , being neither a British citizen nor having lived
    here for  a  continuous  period  of  seven  years  or  more.  In  those
    circumstances Ms TO was required to show (if the precondition at 398(c)
    was met) that the case raised "very compelling circumstances  over  and
    above those described" in paragraph 399.   That is  a  quite  different
    test to the matter of 'reasonableness' addressed in the decision.

23. The question arose  before  me  as  to  whether  my  finding  that  the
    Appellant was not a 'persistent offender' meant that her appeal had  to
    be allowed.   On one reading one might think that to be the case, given
    that the factual basis for the Respondent's decision has been found  to
    be wrong: the  Respondent  cannot  demonstrate  that  his  decision  is
    proportionate, and so the  appeal  must  be  allowed.   This  approach,
    attractive in its simplicity, would  have  the  additional  benefit  of
    protecting claimants from a situation where they had 'won' their  fight
    against  deportation  on  the  facts,  but  find  themselves  with   no
    protection because their appeals are nevertheless  dismissed  on  human
    rights grounds.

24. For the reasons that follow, I  am  satisfied  that  the  task  of  the
    Tribunal cannot end there.

25. The appeal before me is brought under  s82(1)(b)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended):

         '82 Right of appeal to the Tribunal

         (1)      A person ("P") may appeal to the Tribunal where-

             (a) the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a protection
             claim made by P,

             (b) the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human
             rights claim made by P, or

             (c) the Secretary of State has decided to revoke P's
             protection status.'

26. The only ground of appeal open to the Appellant is that set out at  s84
    (2): "an appeal under section 82(1)(b) (refusal of human rights  claim)
    must be brought on the ground  that  the  decision  is  unlawful  under
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998".

27. Section 6(1) of the HRA 1998 provides that "it is unlawful for a public
    authority to act in a way  which  is  incompatible  with  a  Convention
    right".  The 'act' with which I am concerned is  not  the  decision  to
    deport. The 'act', as s82(1)(b) makes clear, is the decision to  refuse
    a human rights claim.   It will be recalled that the decision was  made
    in response to an application made  by  Ms  TO  for  further  leave  to
    remain, in which reliance was placed  on  the  findings  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson (see �4 above) and her claims as to continued
    Kugathas dependency on her natal family in this country.  Those matters
    are expressly considered, and relied upon, by  the  Respondent  in  his
    refusal letter.  It is therefore apparent that it was  not  simply  the
    finding that the Appellant was a 'persistent  offender'  which  led  to
    this claim being refused. In those circumstances it is appropriate that
    the hearing is resumed so that further submissions can be made  by  the
    parties on whether Ms TO should be granted leave  to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds.  Although her daughter is named as a dependent to Mr AO
    (presumably because she featured in his protection claim) her Article 8
    rights would have to be considered in line with her mother:  that  this
    is so is reflected in the decision itself.

28. This brings me back to the decision in respect of Mr AO.   It does  not
    appear to be in  dispute  that  he  is  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with Ms TO and in  those  circumstances  it  seems  to  me
    appropriate to set aside the  decision  of  Judge  Lal  insofar  as  it
    related to his human rights.  The Article 8 claims of all three members
    of this family will therefore be considered at the resumed hearing.




    The Resumed Hearing

29. Prior to the hearing I asked the Secretary of State to clarify  whether
    he wished to pursue  deportation  proceedings  against  Ms  TO  on  the
    grounds that her removal would be conducive to the public  good.  Apart
    from  making  further  submissions  which  inexplicably  revisited  the
    question of whether the  Appellant  was  a  'persistent  offender'  the
    Secretary of State made no such submissions.  Mr Melvin  accepted  that
    the drafter of those submissions may have misunderstood my  directions,
    and invited me to proceed on the basis  that  this  is  now  simply  an
    appeal against a decision to refuse leave.

30. The Appellants elected to provide  no  new  written  evidence,  instead
    relying on their witness statements and the bundles  that  were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. I heard oral evidence from both of  them,  and
    from the mother of Ms  TO,  which  I  summarise  below.  I  then  heard
    submissions from both parties, who agreed  that  the  applicable  legal
    framework in respect of both adult Appellants was as follows:

      i) I should first consider  whether  either  qualified  for  leave  to
         remain on 'family life' grounds under Appendix  FM  of  the  rules.
         Since it was agreed that neither could, this would be brief;

     ii) I should then conduct an analysis of whether either Appellant could
         meet the requirements for leave under the 'private life'  provision
         at paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Rules. This could  only  sensibly  be
         done on the basis that all four members  of  the  family  would  be
         together in Nigeria;

    iii) If neither Appellant  qualified  under  the  rules  I  should  then
         conduct a Razgar enquiry into whether the decision was, despite its
         failure under the Rules, nevertheless disproportionate. In doing so
         I would be required to consider whether the best interests  of  the
         Appellants'  child  lay  in  the  United  Kingdom  or  Nigeria,  in
         accordance with s.55 of the Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act
         2009. I would also be bound to  consider  the  public  interest  in
         their removal, inter alia as expressed in s117B of the Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

    The First Appellant's Evidence

31. Ms TO told me that she had come to live in the United Kingdom in  2000.
    She was then aged 14 and up until that point she had been  living  with
    her maternal grandmother in Nigeria. Her parents had come to the United
    Kingdom when she was 3, and her brother and 2 sisters were  born  here.
    She was ignorant of her own immigration status. She was later told that
    her mother had been under the impression that she would be given a  'no
    time limit' stamp on her passport after she  arrived.  Ms  TO  believes
    that her mother tried to obtain the same from the Home Office  but  was
    unsuccessful.

32. Ms TO attended school in East London. She obtained good GCSEs and  went
    on to take 'A'-levels in Maths, English and Film Studies. She  went  on
    to attend London Metropolitan University, graduating  in  Film  Studies
    and Advertising.

33. After she left university she found it difficult to find work. She  did
    a few placements but after a while her life "went a bit different".  It
    was then that she started using a false document, for which  she  ended
    up doing three months in HMP Holloway.

34. Ms TO told me  that  she  has  no  living  relatives  in  Nigeria.  Her
    immediate  family  are  all  settled  in  the   United   Kingdom.   Her
    grandparents lived in Nigeria until they passed away in 2001  (Grandma)
    and 2017 (Grandfather). Ms TO said that her father continues  to  visit
    Nigeria in his capacity as a pastor - he attends religious  conventions
    there. He stays with old friends.  Her mother does  not  visit.  Ms  TO
    last visited Nigeria herself in 2015 when she went to attend a  wedding
    and visit her grandfather.  She was supposed to go for longer but ended
    up only staying a week because she "couldn't adjust". She is  not  used
    to the life there.  Ms TO said that she would be unable to look to  the
    family of AO for support, because they have  disowned  him.   She  said
    that he would be unable to support himself so he would certainly not be
    able to support her and the children.

35. She got married to Mr AO in 2015. They have two children. In respect of
    the elder child she agreed that the birth  certificate  was  originally
    left blank but it has now been amended to show him as the father.  Both
    children are healthy, as are her  and  her  husband.  Ms  TO  has  been
    referred by her GP for counselling but that hasn't started yet.  Ms  TO
    denied ever having claimed  that  the  child's  father  was  a  British
    national (see my footnote 1 above)

36. In response to Mr Melvin's questions Ms TO explained the  circumstances
    of her second conviction. She had been driving using a licence that was
    not hers. It was her cousin's  licence.   She  panicked  when  she  was
    stopped by police and gave  them  her  cousins  name.  In  her  written
    statement Ms TO states that her time in prison has changed her and that
    she has no intention of committing any  other  criminal  offences.  She
    takes full responsibility for her shortcomings.

    The Second Appellant's Evidence

37. Mr AO states that he  has  not  been  to  Nigeria  since  2007.  He  is
    originally from Ogun State but as far as he is aware  his  parents  are
    now living in Lagos. He has had no contact with them  since  2015.  The
    only member of his family with whom he is in  regular  contact  is  his
    brother, who lives in the United States.

38. Prior to leaving Nigeria Mr AO completed his secondary education and he
    had started a degree in computer science but he abandoned that to  come
    here.   He had leave to enter when he arrived, as a student,  but  that
    was curtailed after the college he was  studying  at  had  its  licence
    revoked.   He worked for a while after that - he was a  security  guard
    for a while and then in 2010-11 he ran  his  own  business  dealing  in
    second-hand cars.

39. Mr AO has two criminal  convictions.   In  2009  he  was  convicted  of
    driving under the influence of alcohol  and  banned;  in  2011  he  was
    caught driving whilst disqualified.

40. In respect of his relationship with Ms TO he said that they had met  in
    2010, and started a relationship in 2013.  They  had  not  been  living
    together when their daughter was born but they  got  back  together  in
    2015.  Mr AO said that he would not be able to  support  his  wife  and
    children in Nigeria because they have  no  accommodation  and  no  jobs
    there. He denied that he might be able to get a job as a security guard
    in Nigeria because they do not have  security  guards  there.  He  then
    accepted that there might be security guards there but  said  that  the
    job is very dangerous and that the pay is low.  Asked by Mr Melvin  why
    his mother and father-in-law in the United  Kingdom  could  not  assist
    them in resettling in Nigeria Mr AO said that  this  was  not  possible
    because "they do not know the system".  Asked  why  he  could  not  re-
    establish his car  selling  business  Mr  AO  said  that  he  had  been
    exporting cars from the United Kingdom to Nigeria and that he would not
    be able to do that if he was there.




    The Evidence of Mrs O - Ms TO's mother

41. Both adult Appellants currently live with Mrs O and  her  husband.  She
    provides them with emotional, physical and financial support.  Although
    she was adamant that she caters for all of their needs  in  the  United
    Kingdom, she was equally adamant that she would  be  unable  to  do  so
    should they relocate to Nigeria.   That is because at  the  moment  the
    budget is spent on one household, of which they are an  integral  part.
    It had five bedrooms and they all eat together.  She  and  her  husband
    both work. Mrs O explained that  if  they  went  back  to  Nigeria  the
    expenses  would  be  substantial.  They  would   have   to   find   new
    accommodation  and  running  a  second  household  is  obviously   more
    expensive.   Mrs O said that her daughter helps her and  supports  her,
    particularly recently when she has started treatment  for  blood  clots
    and is under investigation for her heart. Asked to  summarise  how  she
    would cope if her daughter were to be returned to Nigeria she  said  "I
    can say that I would die".  She denied that either  of  her  other  two
    adult daughters would be available to give her the support that  Ms  TO
    does.

    Appendix FM

42. I accept that there is a family life between the four members  of  this
    family.   The exact date which the adult Appellants embarked upon their
    relationship is distinctly murky, no doubt as a result  of  efforts  on
    their part to conceal the fact that they were together from 2013:  both
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson and the trial judge who  sentenced
    Ms TO were given the impression that she was a lone  parent  caring  on
    her own for her daughter[2].   In any event there is no  dispute  today
    that they are married  and  that  their  relationship  is  genuine  and
    subsisting.  Nor is there any dispute that the  two  children  share  a
    family life with each other, and with their parents.

43. None of the adults or minors in this family have any kind of status  in
    this country, so none are able to act as a 'sponsor' under Appendix FM.
    It  follows  that  no  member  of  the  family  is  able  to  meet  the
    requirements for leave set out therein.

    Paragraph 276ADE(1)

44. The test for leave to remain on private life  grounds  is  set  out  in
    paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules:

         276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the
         date of application, the applicant:

             (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in
             Section S-LTR 1.1 to S-LTR 2.2. and S-LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5.
             in Appendix FM; and

             (ii)      has made a valid application for leave to remain on
             the grounds of private life in the UK; and

             (iii)     has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20
             years (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (iv)      is under the age of 18 years and has lived
             continuously in the UK for at least 7 years (discounting any
             period of imprisonment) and it would not be reasonable to
             expect the applicant to leave the UK; or

             (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent
             at least half of his life living continuously in the UK
             (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (vi)      subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or
             above, has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years
             (discounting any period of imprisonment) but there would be
             very significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into
             the country to which he would have to go if required to leave
             the UK.

45. The sub-paragraph applicable to children is (iv). It is  accepted  that
    neither of the children in this family can meet that test since neither
    has been in this country for seven years.

46. In respect of the adults the relevant provision  would  be  (vi)  which
    requires me to determine whether there are "very significant obstacles"
    to their integration in Nigeria. I consider first the  position  of  Ms
    TO. In his decision of the 11th December 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Hodgkinson found as fact that Ms  TO  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    September 2000 and that she has lived here continuously since then  [at
    �27]. Up until that point  she  had  lived  with  her  grandparents  in
    Nigeria.  She had just celebrated her 15th birthday when she  left.  He
    further found that she no longer knew anyone in that country [at  �35].
    Although that finding does appear to be contradicted  by  the  evidence
    before me to the effect that the Appellant's grandfather  did  not  die
    until two years after that decision, I proceed on the basis that  Judge
    Hodgkinson's findings remain valid today. I accept that Ms TO has lived
    in this country for approaching 19 years and that  she  has  no  living
    relatives in Nigeria.   Judge Hodgkinson further found  [at  �40]  that
    she currently has no accommodation available in Nigeria. I  proceed  on
    the basis that this too remains the case.  I am further satisfied  that
    as the mother to two young children, who has not herself worked  for  a
    number of years, Ms TO would find it extremely  difficult  to  find  or
    hold down a job if she returned to Nigeria.

47. There has however been an important change in circumstances  since  the
    appeal came  before  Judge  Hodgkinson.  That  is  that  Ms  TO  openly
    acknowledges that she is living with, and is married  to,  Mr  AO.   As
    such the family would be returned together.  I  can  find  no  arguable
    reason why two adults with two children, all  of  Nigerian  nationality
    and heritage, would not be able to settle there together.

48. Mr AO submitted that he would be unable  to  work  in  Nigeria  because
    there are no jobs there. Specifically there are no security guard  jobs
    in Nigeria. When it was pointed out to him that this was quite patently
    untrue he changed his evidence to say that he would not  want  to  take
    such a job, since it would be  low  paid  and  dangerous.  He  gave  no
    explanations as to why a healthy educated man of 36 years old would  be
    unable to work to support his family in that country. Plainly  lots  of
    people do work there to support their families.  His assertions to  the
    contrary were not supported by any objective country material.

49. I am also mindful that the Appellants are  presently  supported  by  Ms
    TO's parents, and on the evidence before me, have been for  some  time.
    Whilst I accept that the establishment of a household in Nigeria  would
    likely place some strain on  the  family  finances  overall  I  am  not
    prepared to accept that  Mr  and  Mrs  O  would  simply  cut  them  off
    overnight. That would be completely inconsistent with the support  that
    they have hitherto so generously given.  I  am  satisfied  that  should
    this family be returned to Nigeria, Mr and Mrs O would be  willing  and
    able to give them some financial support in the short  term,  at  least
    until they are established.

50. I am therefore satisfied that whilst the current  lack  of  employment,
    connections and accommodation amount to obstacles  to  resettlement  in
    Nigeria, they are not 'very significantly' so.  Each  of  these  issues
    could be resolved with some effort on the part of the adult  Appellants
    and the assistance of Mr and Mrs O (and if necessary their friends  and
    church connections in  Nigeria).  I  am  satisfied  that  each  of  the
    Appellants have retained a familiarity with  the  culture  of  Nigeria.
    They have both lived in this country in an  extended  Nigerian  family,
    and as Mrs O made clear in her evidence, both she and her  husband  are
    very involved in the Nigerian church (or at least a church with a large
    number of Nigerians in the  congregation)  in  this  country  and  have
    retained their connection to the country of their birth. Mr O has  made
    several visits home in recent years, staying with friends. In Kamara  v
    SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 813 Lord Justice Sales considers  the  meaning  of
    the test in question and says this [at �14]:

         "The idea of 'integration' calls for a broad evaluative judgment to
         be made as to whether the individual will be enough of  an  insider
         in terms of understanding how life in the  society  in  that  other
         country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to
         have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to
         operate on a day-to-day basis in  that  society  and  to  build  up
         within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships  to  give
         substance to the individual's private or family life."

51. I have been told  of  no  obstacles  that  would  prevent  this  couple
    operating on a day-to-day basis in Nigeria. They would, I am satisfied,
    quickly be able to establish private lives there, and  enjoy  a  family
    life with each other.

52. I should add for the  sake  of  completeness  that  before  me  it  was
    suggested that Mr AO faced an obstacle because he was  in  danger  from
    his family, variously because they wished to cut his  daughter,  and/or
    kill him for converting to Christianity. Since  all  of  these  matters
    were rejected by the First-tier Tribunal in  its  protection  decision,
    and those findings remain undisturbed, I am not prepared to revive them
    in the context of the human rights appeal. The simple answer to Mr AO's
    concerns, even taken at their highest, is that he and  his  new  family
    could reasonably be expected to live elsewhere in Nigeria away from his
    parents.

53. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the test in 276ADE(1)(vi) is  made
    out in respect of either Appellant.

    Article 8

54. I note that in 2014  Judge  Hodgkinson  found  that  Ms  TO  enjoyed  a
    Kugathas dependency with her natal family. I am not satisfied that this
    remains the position today. Although she remains financially  dependent
    upon her parents it would seem that this dependency only arises because
    neither she nor her husband are currently permitted by the Home  Office
    to work.    In 2014 the case she put was that she was a young unmarried
    single mother with no one to turn to except her parents. Today  she  is
    33 years old and a married woman. By any  reckoning  she  has  made  an
    independent life for herself, albeit that she and  her  husband  remain
    under her parents' roof.

55. If I am wrong about that it matters little since I am wholly  satisfied
    that Article 8 is engaged: I am satisfied that both Appellants have  an
    established private life in the United Kingdom. Ms TO  has  lived  here
    for 19 years. She has attended school, college and university here  and
    I accept that she has a great many  friends  and  attachments  in  this
    country, including her own natal family. Mr  AO  arrived  in  2007  and
    again I accept that during that period of  long  residence  -  some  12
    years - he is going  to  have  made  a  life  for  himself  here  which
    encompasses close friendships, as well as the relationships  he  enjoys
    with his in-laws, with whom he lives.

56. I accept that the removal of the Appellants would interfere with  their
    Article 8  lives  in  this  country  and  that  as  a  result  of  this
    interference the Article is engaged.

57. I find that the decision to refuse to grant  leave  to  the  Appellants
    arises from the fact that neither qualifies for such  leave  under  the
    rules and that as such the decision is taken lawfully in pursuit of the
    legitimate Article 8(2) aim of protecting the economy.

58. In my assessment of proportionality I have taken the following  matters
    into account on the Appellants' side of the scales:

      i)    I accept and find as fact that both of these Appellants  have  a
         well-established private life in the United Kingdom. They have both
         lived here a long time and whether or not such an  expectation  was
         justified, they have probably both come to regard this  country  as
         their home.   In the case of Ms TO I give especial  weight  to  the
         fact that she was brought here as a  child,  with  the  expectation
         that her parents would take steps  to  regularise  her  immigration
         status. That they did not cannot be a blame laid  at  her  door.  I
         further place particular weight on the fact that  Ms  TO  was,  and
         would return to being, a 'stranded sibling' in that her brother and
         sisters were born and raised in this country.  Both Appellants have
         many friends and connections here that will take  time  to  replace
         should they move to Nigeria;

     ii) In respect of their eldest child, now aged  5,  I  accept  that  it
         would be in her best interests - at least in the short  term  -  to
         remain in this country. She was born here and the only life she has
         ever known is living in the shared accommodation with her  maternal
         grandparents, aunts and uncle. I accept that she is close to all of
         these relatives and that she benefits, as any child would, from the
         input and support of a loving extended family. I accept that she is
         used to life here and that life in Nigeria will - at least  in  the
         short term - be very different and possibly challenging for her. It
         is generally in the best interests of children  to  have  stability
         maintained, and I can find no reason to depart from that  principle
         here;

    iii) I accept that the family members here -  grandmother,  grandfather,
         aunts, uncle and cousins - all enjoy a close relationship with  the
         Appellants' daughter and that  they  would  be  distressed  at  her
         departure;

     iv) I accept that those same relatives will likely be upset to see  the
         Appellants go, in particular Mrs O who clearly passionately  wishes
         that her daughter could remain here.

59. Against the Appellants the following matters must be weighed:

      i)    Section 117B(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
         2002 mandates  decision  makers  to  take  into  account  that  the
         maintenance of immigration control is in the  public  interest.  In
         this context 'immigration control' is reflected in the  Rules.  The
         Appellants fail to meet the requirements of those Rules and  so  it
         is in the public interest that they be refused leave to remain;

     ii) Both Appellants have criminal convictions in this  country.  Ms  TO
         has two separate convictions for the use of false  instruments.  Mr
         AO has two serious driving convictions, one for drink driving,  the
         other for  driving  without  a  licence.  Although  none  of  these
         matters, either individually or cumulatively, would be a sufficient
         basis to pursue deportation proceedings, they are matters that must
         be weighed in the balance against the Appellants in the context  of
         a decision to refuse leave;

    iii) There are no significant obstacles to life continuing  in  Nigeria.
         Each of the Appellants  is  fit  and  able  to  work  or  otherwise
         contribute to the household (e.g. by childcare). All of the  family
         are physically well.  They would be supported, if necessary, by the
         parents of Ms TO who on the evidence before me, have been providing
         the Appellants with everything they need for some time. There is no
         credible evidence to support the  suggestion  that  they  would  be
         destitute or in fact face any significant difficulties at all;

     iv) The family are all Nigerian and can be expected to avail themselves
         of the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of nationality;

      v) There is no credible evidence to support the  claims,  made  before
         me, that Mrs O relies on her daughter for  particular  support,  or
         that she would "die" if her daughter were to be removed. I have  no
         doubt that the two are close, and that as a member of the household
         Ms TO provides assistance to her mother. It remains the  case  that
         Mrs O is not so ill that she is unable to work. Further she has two
         other adult daughters living in this country who could  assist  her
         if necessary;

     vi) ss117B(4)&(5) mandate that I place  only  "little  weight"  on  the
         Appellants' private lives, established as they were at a time  when
         the Appellants were here either unlawfully or precariously.

60. The fact that the Appellants  can  both  speak  English  is  a  neutral
    factor:  s117B(2)  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum   Act   2002.
    Similarly, the fact that they are financially independent, that  is  to
    say not dependent upon the state, is a factor that attracts no positive
    weight, albeit that it is not a matter that should weigh against  them:
    Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  UKSC  58
    [at �52-58].  I make no finding on the best interest  of  the  family's
    youngest  child,  simply  because  no  evidence  was   presented,   nor
    submissions made, on his position. Insofar as my findings in respect of
    his elder sister can be extrapolated to in time include  him,  I  would
    accept that. The parties agreed that s117B(6) has no  application  here
    since neither child is 'qualifying'. Mr  Omoniruvbe  submitted  that  I
    should place weight on the fact that both Appellants  regularly  attend
    church here. In the absence of  any  evidence  that  their  churchgoing
    provides some sort of benefit to the United Kingdom I am  not  prepared
    to do so. It is at best a composite part of their private lives in this
    country, to which I have already attached as  much  weight  as  I  can.
    There are churches in Nigeria, and I fail  to  see  how  removal  would
    result in any interference with their right to  worship  freely  or  to
    hold a particular religious belief.

61. Having had regard to all of those matters, I find as follows.

62. The public interest in maintaining immigration control is a matter that
    automatically assumes significant weight  in  the  balancing  exercise.
    Absent some particularly compelling feature of the evidence  that  will
    generally mean that a failure under the Rules means that  the  decision
    is a proportionate one.   This is a case  which  potentially  had  such
    features. Chief amongst them was my finding that it  would  be  in  the
    best interests of the child(ren) for them to  be  permitted  to  remain
    here, in the country where they have been born and started to grow  up.
    However, as cases such as EV (Philippines) v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874  illustrate,  a  positive  'best
    interests' finding is not in itself sufficient to outweigh  the  public
    interest. Whilst I can certainly accept that it is, on balance, in this
    child's best interest to remain here, the evidence  does  not  indicate
    that this is so powerfully the case that leave should be  granted:  she
    would not be returning to deprivation, nor  war  nor  any  particularly
    adverse circumstances. She would be able  to  attend  school,  and  her
    parents would be able to provide for her. In time she  would  make  new
    friends.   The decision to refuse her parents (and  by  extension  her)
    leave is only contrary to her best interests to the extent that it will
    disrupt her stability and her ability to see her family  members  on  a
    regular basis. As to the issue of ongoing contact I  am  not  satisfied
    that there are any obstacles  to  her  grandparents,  aunts  or  uncles
    visiting her in Nigeria.  Whilst such disruption is significant, it  is
    not to her detriment to the extent that the decision to refuse leave to
    her parents could be said to be disproportionate: see for  instance  KO
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53.

63. Another potentially compelling feature of the evidence is the fact that
    Ms TO has been in this country since she was a child, and that she  has
    been here a very long time indeed. I know that she has not yet  reached
    the '20-year mark' but I cannot think that it would be an impermissible
    adoption of the 'near-miss' principle to take that long residence  into
    account.   It is obviously a relevant factor, as is the fact  that  the
    period of residence started when she was a minor. I am however  mindful
    that during that period of long residence the Appellant has twice  been
    convicted of dishonesty offences. Had  the  only  criminality  weighing
    against her been the 2011 convictions (when in essence she  used  false
    identity papers to try and obtain work) it is doubtful  that  it  is  a
    matter that could have attracted much  more  weight  in  the  balancing
    exercise, given the view  expressed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  ZH
    (Bangladesh) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 8 that illegal working is "part and parcel of  illegal  residence".
    I am however minded to attach significant additional weight to the 2016
    convictions  for  two  reasons.  First,  because  they  post-dated  the
    decision of Judge Hodgkinson and so demonstrated  a  distinct  lack  of
    respect for immigration control: at that stage Ms  TO  was  well  aware
    that she was being permitted to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  a
    discretionary basis but continued to offend regardless. Second  because
    the circumstances of the offence had nothing to do with  any  difficult
    circumstances that she might have found herself in. She had been  given
    leave at that point. She had no reason  to  be  in  possession  of  her
    cousin's documents other than  the  fact  that  she  wanted  to  drive,
    knowing  full  well  that  she  was  not  entitled  to  do  so.    This
    significantly diminishes the already 'little' weight that I can  attach
    to the private life.

64. I have also taken into account the no doubt deeply felt expressions  of
    love expressed towards the Appellants by Mrs O and other members of the
    family who took the trouble to write  -  although  I  have  read  those
    letters I have not set out their evidence here because  I  accept  that
    they would like the couple to be able to stay, and that they value them
    as members of the family.  I accept  that  it  will  in  particular  be
    difficult for Mrs TO's siblings if she is removed, particularly as they
    may feel the (unjustified) feelings  of  guilt  often  associated  with
    'stranded siblings'.  This separation will be emotionally difficult.

65. It will not, however, be unjustifiably harsh. Whilst this young  family
    would like very much to stay in the United Kingdom, the reality is that
    a good life in Nigeria for this young family is perfectly possible.   I
    have been shown no credible evidence  to  the  contrary  and  in  those
    circumstances  am  compelled,  inter  alia  by   operation   of   s117B
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, to dismiss  these  linked
    appeals.




    Decisions

66. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  the  First
    Appellant's human rights appeal is set aside. I remake the decision  in
    respect of the First Appellant's human rights appeal as follows:

         'The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds'

67. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  the  Second
    Appellant's protection claim is upheld.  His  appeal  is  dismissed  on
    protection grounds.

68. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  the  Second
    Appellant's human rights claim is set aside. I remake the  decision  in
    respect of the Second Appellant's human rights appeal as follows:

         'The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds'

69. There is an order for anonymity.
