                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Miss S Watkinson (counsel instructed by Heer Manak) for the appellant
Mr I Graham for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator  (Mr  HO  Forrester),
   sitting at Birmingham on 5 November 2002, dismissing an asylum and  human
   rights appeal by someone who claimed to be  a  half-Gypsy,  half-Albanian
   citizen of Kosovo. Leave was given on  the  basis  of  the  adjudicator's
   approach to the "protection test".

2. The appeal before us turned on whether the adjudicator had been  entitled
   on the facts (including the background evidence, which he was  criticized
   for not paying greater attention to, but which was fully canvassed before
   us) not to see any real risk on return for this appellant. One  important
   feature of the case is whether he would pass as a gaujo (non-Gypsy) other
   than in his own home area, where he might be known. The  adjudicator  saw
   him, and expressed the view that "... he is not  on  first  impression  a
   dark skinned Roma". The appellant was not  present  at  the  hearing  (by
   video-link to Manchester) before us, so we had no opportunity of  forming
   our own judgment on the point.


3. Miss Watkinson argued first that the adjudicator ought not to have  taken
   such a view at all. She cited  Dizdari  [2002]  UKIAT  05537,  where  the
   Tribunal (Mackey VP and a lay member) said at � 21  "The  conclusions  of
   the Adjudicator based on the  Appellant's  personal  appearance  ...  are
   highly speculative and irrational." Apparently there the adjudicator  had
   noted that the appearance of that appellant, also of mixed race, was  not
   dark or swarthy "which one might associate with  Roma  people",  so  that
   others would not be immediately alerted to his origins.

4. For our part, we do not  see  what  was  wrong  with  that  adjudicator's
   judgment, or the present one's, on the evidence of  their  own  eyes.  It
   might well be wrong to disbelieve that someone was a  half-Gypsy  on  the
   basis of their appearance, which  might  entirely  come  from  the  gaujo
   parent. However, what the adjudicators were doing in  each  case  was  to
   form a judgment as to whether the person before them would  look  like  a
   Gypsy to outsiders.

5. Adjudicators see a great many cases involving eastern  European  Gypsies,
   and are well entitled to take judicial notice of the fact  that  they  do
   look distinctly darker than the general population  of  those  countries,
   some showing definite signs of their long-ago Indian origins. If they are
   in effect to be  required  to  go  into  court  blindfold  (whatever  the
   precedent of the well-known statue), then they are being asked to give up
   one of the main advantages of an oral hearing, which  is  being  able  to
   form a direct independent impression of the person before them. We do not
   think the law requires that, and we shall approach  any  internal  flight
   question on the basis of the adjudicator's view that this appellant would
   not look like a Gypsy where he was not known to be partly so.

6. The adjudicator accepted (see �  10)  the  appellant's  history  of  past
   persecution and ill-treatment in his own village. He was born in 1984  to
   an Albanian mother, who died soon after, and a Gypsy father, with whom he
   lived in their own house until the general breakdown of law and order  in
   1999 led to its being burnt down. He said that happened "10 or 20 times",
   which the adjudicator made no comment on.

7. After the last occasion, the appellant and his father were  living  in  a
   tented camp with other Gypsies on the move around the area. He  tried  to
   flee to Macedonia, but did not dare pursue  his  attempts  to  cross  the
   border. After his father died, some time in 2000-01, the appellant  tried
   again to cross into Macedonia, in November 2001, but was not let through,
   so returned to the  camp.  Soon  after  it  was  raided  by  a  group  of
   Albanians, and the appellant was beaten up. He says he was advised  by  a
   friend that complaining to the police would only make things worse, so he
   left, this time for this country and for good.

8. There is  nothing  to  indicate  to  us  that  the  appellant's  personal
   appearance had anything to do with that incident, or any  previous  ones.
   He was living, first with his Gypsy father, and then  in  a  Gypsy  camp,
   which was attacked by hooligans, and he suffered the consequences.  Those
   may indicate that  there  was  no  effective  protection  for  the  Gypsy
   population of the area (Fush� Kosov) at the time in question,  and  there
   is no specific evidence as to the state of things there at present.

9. The adjudicator was clearly wrong to find that what had happened  to  the
   appellant  there  was  not  serious  enough  to  amount   to   Convention
   persecution or ill-treatment, and his treatment of the "protection  test"
   was rather inadequate, too much of it being taken up  with  regurgitation
   of what had been said by the Court of Appeal in  Horvath  [2000]  Imm  AR
   205. However, since he accepted the history, it is  possible  for  us  to
   come to our own view on whether that would either lead to some real  risk
   for this appellant on return to some other part of  Kosovo,  or  make  it
   unduly harsh to expect him to do so.

10. Miss Watkinson's first point is that the appellant would have to  reveal
   his racial origins to get an identity card. Asked for evidence  of  that,
   she referred us to � 6.7 of the decision; but that  is  no  more  than  a
   summary of the appellant's own case. While it is well known that identity
   documents of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, like those of the
   former Soviet Union, did carry the holder's "nationality", meaning racial
   origin, we are not prepared to accept without  some  published  or  other
   independent evidence to that effect  that  the  United  Nations-sponsored
   authorities in Kosovo would countenance any such arrangements.

11. Next Miss Watkinson argued that the appellant would have to  reveal  his
   origins, if only his last address in a Gypsy camp to get  help  from  any
   organization in Kosovo. Again there is no evidence of such  organizations
   administering any racial questionnaire;  and  there  does  not  seem  any
   reason why the appellant should not give his last permanent address,  the
   paternal home in Fush� Kosov, an area inhabited by Albanians and  Gypsies
   alike.

12. The conclusion must be that the appellant  could  pass  as  an  ordinary
   Albanian on return to  Kosovo,  anywhere  away  from  Fush�  Kosov.  Miss
   Watkinson questioned in reply whether he should be required to do so,  in
   the light of � 6.48 of the CIPU report, which we  had  already  discussed
   with Mr Graham in the course of his submissions. This suggests that

   Ethnic identification as Roma, Ashkaelia or Egyptian is  not  necessarily
   determined by easily discernible or distinct characteristics or  cultural
   traits, but rather  by  a  process  of  self-identification.  It  is  not
   uncommon  in  Kosovo  for  individuals  to  change  their  ethnic   self-
   identification  depending  on  the  pressures  of  local   circumstances,
   especially when it is necessary in  order  to  distance  themselves  from
   other groups to avoid negative associations. In general, however,  ethnic
   Roma clearly identify themselves as Roma and tend to use Romany as  their
   mother tongue, although a large percentage of  the  Roma  population  can
   speak Serbian (and to a lesser extent Albanian) languages.

13. To this we inquired whether the  appellant  had  expressed  his  "ethnic
   self-identification" in any way in this country, other than by making his
   asylum claim on the basis he  did.  Miss  Watkinson  could  point  to  no
   evidence of that, and we cannot see that a young single Albanian-speaking
   and -looking man with no family ties could be identified by others  as  a
   half-Gypsy, or would be entitled to insist on so identifying  himself  to
   them, regardless of any risk involved.

14. That conclusion is of some  importance,  because  we  did  not  entirely
   accept the relatively rosy picture Mr Graham painted of the situation  of
   Gypsies in Kosovo generally. The UNHCR in their paper of January 2003  at
   title II, 'Minorities', refer  to  "serious  protection  problems"  still
   faced by Gypsies, in particular the Roma. While their situation  is  said
   to be comparable to that of the Serbs, we do not see any warrant for Miss
   Watkinson's suggestion that this leads to any special risk for persons of
   mixed Roma/Albanian origins, such as this appellant, in  the  context  of
   what is said at title  I  'Kosovo  Albanians'  about  "persons  of  mixed
   ethnicity". That does no more than explain  that  some  people  otherwise
   part of the majority population may yet be at risk.

15. What still does give some cause for concern, however,  is  the  evidence
   about Gypsies still living together in their communities. The CIPU report
   of October 2002 refers (� 6.51)  to  "...  notable  improvements  in  the
   security and freedom  of  movement  situation  for  [Gypsies:  the  three
   groups, Roma, Ashkaelia and Egyptians, are referred to, and from here  on
   by the acronym RAE] throughout Kosovo during the past year."  There  were
   local differences, but no murders during 2002, though the  potential  for
   violence remained and the security situation, it was said, could still be
   precarious. The main area of concern is set out at � 6.53:

   RAE continue to experience adverse living conditions  due  to  historical
   patterns of discrimination, ostracism  and  marginalisation.  [18]  Large
   numbers of Roma are still living in collective centres or  IDP  camps  in
   poor conditions.  The fact that they choose  to  stay  in  these  centres
   suggests that they remain concerned about the security situation in their
   areas of origin or do not have adequate possibilities  for  accommodation
   there.  One of the main obstacles to  return  is  the  lack  of  adequate
   reconstruction assistance for repairing  their  damaged  property.  [18b]
   [67a] [67b]


16. If we saw any real risk of this appellant  having  to  live  in  such  a
   camp, we should have to decide whether the conditions would  either  make
   it an unduly harsh form of internal  flight,  or  "inhuman  or  degrading
   treatment" to expect him to go there.  However,  we  see  no  reason,  as
   already explained, why he should be identified as a half-Gypsy on return,
   or need to identify himself as such.
