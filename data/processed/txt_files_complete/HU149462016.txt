Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Waithe, instructed by Solomon Shepherd
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Cameroon, born on 29 May 1990.  She  has
      been given permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Graham dismissing her appeal against  the  respondent's
      decision to refuse her human rights claim.


   2. The appellant entered the UK on 26 August 2010 with leave to enter  as
      a Tier 4 (General)  Student  valid  until  31  December  2012.  On  10
      September 2013 she was  granted  leave  to  remain  under  EX.1(b)  of
      Appendix FM of the immigration  rules  as  the  spouse  of  a  British
      citizen, Kevin Andrew Hunt until 10 March 2016, on the  basis  of  her
      husband's  relationship  with  his  British  child  from  a   previous
      relationship, Conor Charlton Hunt, born on 8 October 1997. On 9  March
      2016 the appellant applied for further leave to remain as  the  spouse
      of Kevin Andrew Hunt, but this time on the basis of  his  relationship
      with his daughter from a previous relationship, Emily May Hunt.

   3. The respondent refused the appellant's application in a decision dated
      9 May 2016. The respondent did not accept  that  the  appellant  could
      meet the eligibility requirements of paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1.(c)(ii)  as
      she had failed to  satisfy  the  specified  evidence  requirements  in
      Appendix FM-SE to show that she could meet the financial  requirements
      of the immigration rules. She had provided evidence in relation to her
      self-employment as a mobile hairdresser  showing  annual  earnings  of
      �5,478 for the financial year 2014-15. However,  with  regard  to  her
      earnings from employment  with  Accord  Group,  she  claimed  to  earn
      �14,400 per annum but had failed to provide the required  evidence  of
      that income. She had provided 8 months' payslips dated  June  2015  to
      February 2016 from Accord and  bank  statements  for  the  five  month
      period from September 2015 to January 2016. She had  not  provided  an
      employers'  letter  but  instead  provided  a  zero-hours   employment
      contract dated 11 March 2014. The respondent was accordingly unable to
      corroborate her claimed salary. Having found that the appellant  could
      not meet the requirements for the 5-year partner route, the respondent
      considered the 10-year partner route. The respondent  concluded  that,
      whilst the appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
      British partner, there was no evidence of insurmountable obstacles  to
      family life continuing outside the UK for the purposes of EX.1.(b)  of
      Appendix FM, as there was no evidence to show that her  spouse  had  a
      relationship with his child Emily May Hunt. The respondent  considered
      that the appellant could not meet the relevant criteria  in  paragraph
      276ADE(1) on the  basis  of  private  life  and  that  there  were  no
      exceptional circumstances justifying a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
      immigration rules. The respondent noted that the appellant's  spouse's
      son Conor was no longer a child and that at the time of  the  previous
      application her spouse was the subject of a 12  month  non-molestation
      order preventing him from going near his ex-partner and their daughter
      Emily. There was no evidence of his claimed regular contact  with  his
      daughter and the respondent considered that it  was  in  Emily's  best
      interests to remain in the UK with her mother.


   4. The appellant appealed  against  that  decision  and  her  appeal  was
      determined on the papers by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Graham  on  1
      August 2016. For the appeal the appellant produced a letter  from  her
      employer and submitted that the respondent  ought  to  have  exercised
      discretion in paragraph D(e) of Appendix FM-SE because she had given a
      valid reason for not supplying an employment letter,  namely  that  an
      applicant with a zero hours contract could not produce  an  employment
      letter to satisfy section Appendix FM-SE Part 2(b).  The  judge  noted
      that the appellant accepted that she had not produced corresponding  6
      months of bank statements with her application but she  had  submitted
      the missing bank statement for the appeal. The judge  considered  that
      the  appellant  ought  to  have,  but  had  not,  requested  that  the
      respondent  exercise  discretion.  The  judge  considered   that   the
      respondent was not required to  exercise  discretion  to  contact  the
      appellant for the missing document, since the application  would  have
      been refused in any event due to the lack of an employer's letter. She
      found that an employment letter could and should  have  been  supplied
      with the application and that the appellant could not, therefore, meet
      the financial requirements in  Appendix  FM  for  the  5-year  partner
      route. The judge went on to consider the  10-year  partner  route  but
      found that there were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
      continuing outside the UK for the purposes of EX.1.  The  judge  noted
      that the appellant's spouse's son was an adult and that there  was  no
      evidence of emotional dependency. With regard to his  daughter  Emily,
      the judge found no evidence to support the claim that the  restraining
      order had been lifted and that the appellant's spouse saw his daughter
      every weekend and no evidence of any contact between them.  The  judge
      found there to be no exceptional circumstances outside the  rules  and
      that the requirements in Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE could not be
      met. Accordingly she dismissed the  appeal  in  a  decision  dated  17
      August 2016.

   5. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by the appellant
      and initially refused in the First-tier Tribunal. Permission was  then
      granted in the Upper Tribunal on 14 March  2017,  essentially  on  the
      grounds that there were arguably no clear findings as to  whether  the
      appellant met the maintenance requirements of the  immigration  rules.
      The matter then came before me.

Appeal Hearing

   6. Mr Waithe relied on the grounds  and  submitted  that  the  judge  had
      before her all the relevant documents  to  demonstrate  an  income  of
      above �18,600 for the appellant and  was  duty  bound  to  accept  the
      evidence before her as admissible, in accordance with  the  principles
      in Mandalia v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]  UKSC
      59 and the statutory provisions in section 85(4) of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. He  relied  on  the  judgment  in  MM
      (Lebanon) & Ors, R( on the applications of) v Secretary of  State  and
      another [2017] UKSC 10 in submitting that the Supreme Court identified
      problems with the �18,600 income threshold and that changes were to be
      made. The appellant met the requirements of the immigration rules.  In
      the  alternative  the  judge  erred  by   failing   to   give   proper
      consideration to proportionality in  the  context  of  Article  8  and
      failed to consider the best interests of the child.

   7. Ms  Pettersen  submitted  that  the  judge  properly  found  that  the
      respondent was not required to exercise discretion and request further
      documentation under the evidential flexibility provisions.  The  judge
      properly found that the specified evidence had not been  provided  and
      that the requirements of the immigration rules in Appendix  FM-SE  had
      not been met.  The  grounds  referring  to  Article  8  and  the  best
      interests of the  child  were  essentially  a  disagreement  with  the
      judge's decision. The judge properly considered all relevant  material
      and did not err in law.


Consideration and findings

   8. I note that the appellant's permission application  was  made  out  of
      time  and  that  that  matter  was  not  addressed  in  the  grant  of
      permission.  Neither was the matter raised at the hearing  before  me.
      However it has now come to my attention. For the  sake  of  expedience
      and completeness I extend time and admit the application. However I do
      not consider the grounds to be made out and do not find  there  to  be
      any errors of law in the judge's decision.


   9. Mr Waithe submitted that the statutory obligation in section 85(4)  of
      the 2002 Act could not be overridden and that, on the basis  that  the
      appellant had since produced evidence of an income  of  above  �18,600
      the judge  ought  to  have  accepted  that  the  requirements  of  the
      immigration rules were met. However such a submission betrays a  clear
      misunderstanding of section 85(4), a provision which the judge plainly
      had in mind and referred to at [9]. The substance of the  respondent's
      decision was that  the  appellant  had  failed  to  provide  mandatory
      specified  evidence  of  her  claimed  income  with  her  application.
      Evidence  subsequently  produced  at  the  appeal   hearing   of   the
      appellant's income, whilst arguably supporting the  appellant's  claim
      to earn the required level of income,  was  nevertheless  clearly  not
      capable of rectifying an omission to produce the  documents  with  the
      application.


  10. Neither was the appellant  assisted  by  the  principles  set  out  in
      Mandalia since her circumstances differed to that case, as  there  was
      not simply a failure to provide one  category  of  specified  evidence
      listed in Appendix FM part 2, but she had failed to provide two of the
      categories of specified evidence.  The  judge  had  full  and  careful
      regard to the documents  provided  by  the  appellant  and  those  not
      provided. She considered the explanation provided by the appellant for
      failing to  produce  that  evidence  with  her  application  and  gave
      detailed consideration to the question of whether the respondent ought
      to have contacted the appellant  and  to  have  provided  her  with  a
      further  opportunity  to  provide  the   missing   documentation,   in
      accordance with the evidential flexibility provisions in  paragraph  D
      of Appendix FM-SE, in particular D(c) and  (e).  She  also  considered
      relevant case  law  in  regard  to  the  circumstances  in  which  the
      respondent would  consider  exercising  discretion,  noting  that  the
      appellant had made no request for such an exercise of  discretion.  At
      [20]  to  [22]  the  judge  gave  cogent  reasons  for  rejecting  the
      appellant's explanation for not providing an employer's letter and for
      concluding that such a letter could and should have been supplied with
      the application. She was  perfectly  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
      evidential flexibility provisions did  not  assist  the  appellant  in
      light of the limited evidence provided with the application  and  that
      the production of the documents post application and decision did  not
      resolve the reasons  for  refusal  under  Appendix  FM-SE.  The  judge
      accordingly properly found that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
      financial requirements of the immigration rules with respect to the 5-
      year partner route.

  11. As for the 10-year partner route, the relevant issue  was  whether  or
      not there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
      outside the UK. That was a matter fully and properly considered by the
      judge at [24] to [27]. The appellant had  previously  succeeded  under
      EX.1(b) on the basis of her husband's relationship with his son from a
      previous relationship. However, as the judge found at  [24],  his  son
      was no longer a child and the relationship would not  therefore  cause
      obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  outside  the  UK.  The  judge
      considered the appellant's spouse's relationship with his daughter and
      gave cogent reasons for concluding that that was also not a reason for
      finding there to be insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  outside
      the UK given the lack of evidence of  that  relationship  and  of  any
      contact between the parties. The judge considered the  best  interests
      of the child Emily both in the context of  "insurmountable  obstacles"
      under EX.1(b) as well as in the context  of  compelling  circumstances
      outside the immigration rules on wider Article  8  grounds,  providing
      full and cogent reasons for concluding that the  appellant  could  not
      succeed on either basis.

  12. Contrary to the assertion in the grounds and the submissions  made  by
      Mr Waithe, the judge conducted a full and proper consideration of  all
      relevant matters both within and outside  the  immigration  rules  and
      provided cogent  reasons  for  concluding  that  the  public  interest
      outweighed the interests of the appellant and that  the  decision  was
      not in breach of  her  Article  8  rights.  The  judge  was  perfectly
      entitled to reach the decision that she did  on  the  evidence  before
      her. There are no  errors  of  law  in  her  decision.  I  uphold  the
      decision.

DECISION

  13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal stands.
