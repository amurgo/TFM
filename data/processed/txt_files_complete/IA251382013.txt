Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Pararajasingam instructed by Freedman Alexander
LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Tanzania born on 9  January,  1974.  She
      entered this country on 28 May, 2006 and was granted leave  to  remain
      as a domestic worker until 18 November, 2012. She made an  application
      for indefinite leave to remain on 16 October, 2012. On 7 June 2013 the
      respondent refused this application.

   2. The appellant appealed the decision and her appeal came before a First-
      tier Judge on 18 November, 2013. The  grounds  before  the  First-tier
      Judge were to the effect that the respondent had been wrong to  refuse
      the application under the immigration rules. There was another  ground
      which  was  not  pursued  at  the  hearing  in  relation  to   removal
      directions.

   3. The application had been refused under the rules because the appellant
      had only been working 16 hours per week whereas it was  a  requirement
      of paragraph 159 A (vi) of HC 395 that the appellant be employed as  a
      domestic worker full-time throughout the five year qualifying period.

   4. Although Article 8 was not raised before the First-tier Judge  in  the
      grounds of appeal there was evidence that the appellant  was  pregnant
      and some e-mail communications between  the  appellant  and  a  Polish
      National. It was  said  the  appellant  was  tenant  of  the  property
      occupied by the Polish National.

   5. The appellant was called and gave evidence and it was not until  after
      the respondent  had  made  submissions  that  Ms  Pararajasingam  (who
      represented the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal as  she  does
      before us) sought to raise issues under Article 8 and the  Immigration
      (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

   6. The First-tier Judge stated:

           "At that point I advised her that my view was that there was  no
           Article 8 appeal before me as the  grounds  of  appeal  did  not
           refer to Article 8 and nor did they  refer  to  the  Immigration
           (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 which it seemed to  me
           might have been relevant  given  that  the  appellant's  witness
           statement is to the effect that she has been  living  with  ...a
           Polish citizen since 2011 and is due  to  give  birth  to  their
           child on 8 December, 2013."

   7. Ms Pararajasingam applied to amend the grounds  of  appeal  which  the
      judge refused for the following reasons. First, the application should
      have been made before the hearing rather than during  submissions  and
      the representatives had  had  more  than  adequate  time  to  make  an
      application to vary the grounds if they had thought that to have  been
      appropriate. Moreover the points had not been raised pursuant  to  the
      section 120 notice  that  had  been  served.  The  judge  referred  to
      Lamichhane v Secretary of State [2012] EWCA Civ 260  and  Jaff  [2012]
      UKUT 00396.

   8. The judge went on to dismiss the appeal under  the  immigration  rules
      noting that it always had been a requirement  of  the  relevant  rules
      that the proposed employment be full-time and the  appellant  had  not
      been prejudiced by any relevant change in the rules. It  was  for  the
      appellant to make a fresh application under the  2006  regulations  if
      she was so advised.

   9. Permission to appeal was granted on 17 December 2013 on the basis that
      it was arguable  the  Article  8  point  was  Robinson  obvious  (R  v
      Secretary of State ex parte Robinson [1997] Imm. A.R. 568) and that it
      was arguable that the failure to mention a ground  in  response  to  a
      section 120 notice did not preclude the Tribunal from considering that
      ground. The judge referred to MB (Pakistan) [2010] UKUT 282 (IAC).  In
      that case there had been nothing before the First-tier Tribunal  judge
      to indicate that the article  8  point  was  obvious  whereas  in  the
      instant case in contrast "there  was  a  witness  statement  from  the
      appellant specifically referring to her pregnancy and  the  fact  that
      the father of her unborn child was  an  EEA  national  with  whom  she
      proposed to enjoy a family life are some point in the UK."

  10. Since the hearing before the First-tier tribunal the appellant has had
      a child and there is a letter from the Polish  national  stating  that
      the appellant (his fiancï¿½e) is living in  his  apartment  and  looking
      after his daughter and that he is at present in prison in  Poland.  He
      intends to return to the United Kingdom as soon as practicable.

  11. Mr Duffy acknowledged that there was an error of law in  the  decision
      of the First-tier Judge. However, he submitted that the error was  not
      material in that it was clear from the case of Lamichhane v  Secretary
      of State that grounds could not be varied to take in a point under the
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and the  Article
      8 issues were inextricably linked and dependent on the arguments under
      the regulations. The argument  would  depend  on   Zambrano  v  Office
      National de l'emploi (c-34/09) [2011] INLR 481 CJEU, the principle now
      reflected in Regulation 15A. The appellant's  remedy  was  to  make  a
      fresh application under the Regulations.

  12. Ms Pararajasingam submitted that the  Article  8  point  was  arguable
      independently of the Regulations and invited us to remit the appeal as
      it had been conceded that there had been an error of law.

  13. Decision

  14. It having been properly conceded by Mr Duffy  that  the  determination
      was flawed in law, we cannot say that the failure to consider  Article
      8 was not a material error. Although as he says the Article issues may
      be bound up with the issues under the regulations it does  not  follow
      that the Article 8 arguments have no merit or are bound to fail.

  15. In the particular circumstances of this case we feel that  the  appeal
      should be remitted for hearing afresh before the  First-tier  Tribunal
      since there has been no consideration of the Article 8 issues.

  16. In additon, the appellant may consider lodging  an  application  under
      the Regulations as Mr Duffy suggested. That is of course a matter for
      the appellant and her advisers.

  17. The appeal will be allowed and remitted for hearing before the  First-
      tier Tribunal to consider Article 8.
