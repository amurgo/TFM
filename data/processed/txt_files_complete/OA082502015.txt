                 secretary of state for the home department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                          MR BENNETH NDUBUISI OPARA
                         (ANONYMITY ORDER NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-Tier Tribunal Judge Harris who on  4  January  2017  allowed  the
    appeal of Mr Opara on human rights grounds.  Permission to  appeal  was
    granted and thus the appeal came before me on the above date.

The Hearing

 2. Ms Ahmed, the Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, told  me  that  it
    was accepted that the Judge had been entitled to consider the  evidence
    he had considered and sought leave to withdraw the appeal.   There  was
    no opposition to that application.

 3. Mindful of Rule 17(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, I accepted withdrawal of the Secretary of  State's  case.   As  a
    result their appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.



Signed   JG Macdonald                            Date 3rd November 2017
