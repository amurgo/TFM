Representation
For the appellant:     Mr B Naumann, counsel instructed by  Duncan  Lewis  &
                   Co
For the respondent:    Miss  J  Bracken,  barrister  employed  by  the  Home
                   Office


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by a Kurdish citizen of Turkey against the decision of
   an adjudicator, Mrs TI Rabin, sitting at  Taylor  House  on  16  January
   2003, dismissing his appeal on both asylum  and  human  rights  grounds.
   Leave was given on grounds of appeal which included four points, and  it
   is easiest to deal with the third and fourth first.

2. The fourth ground complains that the adjudicator failed to consider  the
   appellant's case under articles 9 and 10 of the Human Rights Convention.
    This was not pursued before us by Mr Naumann, entirely realistically in
   the light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Ullah  [2002]  EWCA
   Civ 1856. Ground 3 complains  of  the  adjudicator's  rejection  of  the
   appeal on article 8 grounds.  Here she dealt with the evidence about the
   appellant's position here at paragraph 40:

   The appellant stated that he had known his girlfriend for 8  months  but
   that they had been close for two months.  When asked how  he  saw  their
   future he stated that he could not say what would happen and was  unsure
   whether they would live together.

3. The adjudicator had already noted that the appellant had a  brother  and
   sister here, though the rest of his immediate  family  were  in  Turkey.
   That is criticised in the grounds of  appeal,  on  the  basis  that  the
   appellant's relationship  with  his  girlfriend  had  lasted  for  eight
   months, though they had known  each  other  for  longer.   Whatever  the
   history of their relationship, it was not at that stage one which was on
   the evidence destined to be permanent and the appellant was quite  frank
   with the adjudicator about that.

4. There is a suggestion in Mr Naumann's skeleton argument that things have
   now moved on to the stage where it has become a permanent  relationship.
   That is not evidence.  If this point were to have  been  pursued  before
   us, the very least that would have been required would be an application
   for leave to produce statements from the appellant and his girlfriend to
   say what the state of affairs between them now was, on which they  might
   well have been  required  to  give  oral  evidence,  subject  to  cross-
   examination.  This has not  been  done.   On  the  evidence  before  the
   adjudicator,  she  was  fully  entitled  to  find  that  there  was   no
   interference with the respect for family life enjoined by article 8.  It
   follows that this ground cannot succeed.

5. So we turn back to grounds 1 and  2,  which  refer  to  the  asylum  and
   article 3 case.  Ground 1 complains about the adjudicator's  failure  to
   consider submissions, written and oral.  As far as that is concerned, Mr
   Naumann has been free to make whatever submissions he chose to  us,  and
   we have  considered  them.  Ground  2  refers  to  failure  to  consider
   background evidence. Again the same applied before us.

6. The point on the asylum/article 3 case  which  understandably  exercized
   the chairman who gave leave was the lack of clarity in the adjudicator's
   credibility findings.  To give the full picture of that, we need to  set
   out what she actually said, beginning with the appellant's history

   14.  The appellant stated that he became involved with HADEP at the  age
   of 15.  He stated that between 1991 and 1992 he was  picked  up  by  the
   police for questioning at least six times.  In his statement he  claimed
   that on some of those occasions he was simply questioned whilst on other
   occasions he was beaten and kicked. He also stated that he  was  pounded
   with water cannon.  He stated that he was  arrested  on  his  own  three
   times and on other occasions he was arrested with others.  In his record
   of interview he claimed that he was detained for 10 hours.


   15.  The appellant stated that he was involved with  violent  activities
   for HADEP for some years.  He maintained in his interview  that  he  was
   involved in violence against the gendarmes in 1998.  At the  hearing  he
   first claimed that he was involved in violent  activities  in  1990  and
   possibly 1991, but then admitted that he  had  never  been  involved  in
   violent acts but had only been a back-up carrying. There appears to be a
   gap there which appears to relate to a claim that he had  made  that  he
   had been carrying arms and ammunition.


   16.  The appellant stated  that  the  first  time  he  was  arrested  in
   1991/1992 he was detained for a month.  He said that he was arrested  at
   the same time as a man named Hussain Coku who  was  released  and  found
   dead one month later in the mountains.   He  also  stated  that  another
   person with whom he had been arrested on one  occasion  had  been  found
   dead after his release.  The appellant stated that he went to Ankara  in
   1992 as he was tired of being constantly  harassed  and  beaten  by  the
   police.  He stated that he worked as a builders' labourer  and  remained
   politically active.  He stated that he came to the notice of the police,
   although he was not arrested, and decided to return to Elbistan in March
   1993.  At the hearing the appellant stated that  he  had  been  arrested
   whilst in Ankara when delivering leaflets.


   18.  The appellant stated that he was arrested again one week after  his
   return to Elbistan when he was taken from the family home by  10  or  15
   soldiers.  He stated that he was taken to the army barracks where he was
   detained for seven months and then released.  He  claimed  that  he  was
   tortured by kicking, that he was put into a tank of excrement where  his
   head was held under ten times.  He later claimed that he was held upside
   down.  He stated that he was detained for seven months without charge or
   the opportunity to  see  a  lawyer.   This  was  in  contrast  with  his
   assertion  at  the  hearing  that  he  was  sentenced  to  seven  months
   imprisonment as a punishment for what he did.


   19.  The appellant stated that he left Elbistan again  in  October  1993
   when he went to Izmir to stay with relatives.  He claimed  that  he  was
   actively involved with HADEP by distributing  leaflets  and  putting  up
   posters.  His relatives were also involved and they were arrested.   The
   appellant stated that he supported himself as a building  labourer.   He
   stated that he was arrested again in 1995 when he was held for  a  month
   before performing his military service.


   20.  The appellant claimed that he was ill-treated  in  the  army  as  a
   result of being a Kurd.  He said that he was only given menial tasks and
   was punished by being placed in solitary confinement.  He stated that he
   was in the army for two years and left in August  1996.   He  stated  he
   returned to Elbistan where he found life difficult and went to Russia to
   work as a labourer.  He said that he remained there for four months  but
   at the hearing he stated that he was in  Russia for a year and  that  he
   left because he did not like the climate.


   21.  The appellant claimed that he returned to his village in March 1999
   and that he was stopped by the gendarmes while visiting his father.   He
   stated that his father persuaded the gendarmes that  he  would  persuade
   the appellant to help the gendarmes and act as a village guard.

   The adjudicator then gives details of the appellant's departure for this
   country, which took place in  July  1999  with  money  provided  by  his
   father, who sent him here by way of Istanbul in February 2000.

7. The adjudicator dealt with the appellant's history at paragraphs  33  to
   36.  She did so in general terms as to  inconsistencies,  which  do  not
   assist us in seeing whether she was entitled to  come  to  the  decision
   which she did, or not.  She concluded in  general  that  she  had  grave
   doubts about the credibility of the appellant's claims of detention  and
   ill-treatment.  If that were the situation she was left in, then she was
   entitled in terms of the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Karanakaran
   [2000] Imm AR 271 to say so.  However, if she really meant that she  did
   not regard  the  appellant's  history,  or  any  part  of  it,  as  even
   reasonably likely to be true, then it would have been far  more  helpful
   if she had said that.

8. Miss Bracken has referred us to discrepancies which the adjudicator  did
   pick out in relating the history:

   at paragraph 15     in terms of whether the appellant had been  involved
                 in violence himself or not;
   at paragraph 17     as to whether he had been arrested in Ankara in 1992
   or not;
   at paragraph 18     as to whether his seven months detention in 1993 had
                 been of an administrative kind or under the sentence  of  a
                 court, military or otherwise.


9. There is also the point made by the adjudicator at  paragraph  34  about
   the appellant's lack of knowledge of  HADEP.   For  this  she  gives  no
   details at all which, as Miss Bracken acknowledges, is not satisfactory.
    Coming to the way in  which  we  should  approach  the  case,  we  have
   reluctantly reached the view that, despite the grave doubts described by
   the adjudicator, which may well have been justified, we  ought  to  deal
   with this appeal on the basis of the  appellant's  case,  taken  at  its
   highest.

10. It will have been noted, in the adjudicator's review  of  the  evidence,
   at paragraph 18, that the appellant is quoted as saying in his interview
   that he had been involved in violence against  the  gendarmes  in  1998.
   That is right as far as it goes: see question 40.  However,  anyone  who
   reads on to question 41 will see that the appellant was saying that this
   had happened at the same time as the  leader  of  HADEP,  who  he  there
   spells Koku, was killed.   Although  the  adjudicator's  record  of  the
   appellant's oral evidence has him answering the question:  "Is it  right
   that you were involved in violent activities in  1998?"   "Yes  that  is
   right", it is quite clear that the case that the appellant meant to  put
   forward before the adjudicator did have him involved  in  that  sort  of
   activity around the time of the death of Koku (or �oku, as it  seems  he
   should be spelt).  This is reasonably clear from the  appellant's  first
   statement which is dated 12 October 2000.

11. In the appellant's second statement, which we are told was  prepared  in
   response to the refusal letter, it is made quite clear what his case was
   on this point.

   As regards the date of the death of Koku, this was in 1993.  I  did  not
   say in interview that this was in 1998.  I was not  asked  in  interview
   when Koku had been killed. I was asked when I started  violent  activity
   and I replied in 1998.

   That year of 1998 has been crossed  out  by  the  person  who  took  the
   statement or submitted it and  replaced  with  '1988'.   This  certainly
   seems to fit in with the next sentence which reads:


   I did not know why the record of interview states 1998 but I  assume  it
   was an error on the part of the interpreter who himself told me that  he
   was from Cyprus.  I would not have said Koku died in  1998  when  I  had
   said in an earlier statement that he died some time earlier.

   The adjudicator clearly did not take any equivocation as to the date  of
   those events against the appellant,  and  there  is  a  basis  for  that
   allowance to be made,  in  the  passages  we  have  read  out  from  the
   statement.

12. Before us the appellant sought to rely  on  what  is  described  in  the
   index to his latest bundle as an arrest warrant.  It is a warrant on the
   face of  it  directing  his  arrest,  but  pursuant  to  a  sentence  of
   imprisonment for three years and five months for allowing his rifle  and
   20 rounds of ammunition, which he held as a village guard, to  be  taken
   by force from him by members of the PKK.  This document was  first  seen
   by us at the hearing when we were referred to it.  It had arrived at the
   Tribunal building on the day before the  hearing,  18  February,  having
   been sent on the 17th.  The appellant's solicitors' explanation for that
   is as follows:

   We sincerely apologise for the late submission. We are  aware  that  the
   appellant's bundle of papers was to be served 14 days in advance of  the
   hearing.  We experienced problems in obtaining the arrest warrant  which
   constitutes a significant part of  the  appellant's  case.   The  arrest
   warrant was with the appellant's previous legal representatives  and  we
   did not receive it until 6 February 2004, please see attached  evidence.
   This refers to a letter from the previous solicitors dated  5  February.
   Once we had received the arrest warrant we  immediately  took  steps  to
   obtain  a  translation  which  we  received  on  12  February  2004  and
   subsequently took instructions regarding the  document  on  13  February
   2004.

13. The appellant's case, as put before  us  by  Mr  Naumann,  was  that  he
   himself had produced the warrant, having  presumably  received  it  from
   Turkey, though it is not made clear how, shortly before the  adjudicator
   hearing and handed it to his own counsel, who was not Mr Naumann.  Since
   the appellant had not been able to  produce  a  translation  it  is  not
   surprising that that counsel did not seek to make any use of  it  before
   the adjudicator.

14. The main difficulty with the appellant's case on  this  point  is  this.
   The warrant as we have noted says that he had been sentenced  to  nearly
   3� years imprisonment for having his rifle and ammunition taken from him
   by force.   The  appellant  said  nothing  at  all  about  that  to  the
   adjudicator. Whether his counsel was prepared to use the warrant or not,
   we find that astonishing, as it would have been obvious to anyone  that,
   if he were at risk of anything on return to Turkey, that  sentence  must
   have been the main ingredient.

15. The other strange thing about the warrant is that it has no date on  it.
   There is a highly professional translation, from which we  can  see  the
   date of the alleged offence and the year of its court registration;  but
   nowhere on that translation, nor on the document itself,  is  there  any
   date showing when it was issued.  That is not something  which  we  have
   come across before on any document purporting to  emanate  from  Turkey,
   certainly not from any court.

16. Taking those points together, we  regard  this  warrant  as  a  document
   which cannot be relied on in any way.  That is not however  the  end  of
   the case, because Mr Naumann does rely on the appellant's history  as  a
   whole, in terms of his past work with HADEP and detentions.  It is clear
   from the leading case, ACDOG [2003] UKIAT 00034, that a past history  of
   political involvement and detention may be relevant; but  equally  clear
   that it does not lead to a risk on return in every case.  The individual
   history has to be considered.

17. This appellant had worked for HADEP at only a low level,  postering  and
   leafletting, between 1993 and 1995.  Apart from the evidence about  what
   happened in 1999, his last hostile contact with the Turkish  authorities
   had been when he  was  detained  for  one  month  in  1995.   From  that
   detention he was sent into military service; and, after he had completed
   his service, he was allowed to go free, to the extent that he  was  able
   to leave the country for Russia and return, apparently without  problems
   as the adjudicator noted.  We cannot see  how  that  history,  taken  by
   itself, could possibly expose him to any real risk on return  now.   Any
   such possibility must turn on the events of April to July  1999,  during
   which time, on the appellant's own account, he  was  left  free  on  the
   basis that he served as a village guard.

18. Once the evidence about the warrant is rejected, this  appellant's  case
   has to be considered on the basis of whether there is now any real  risk
   to somebody who absconded from service as a village guard in 1999.   The
   only relevant evidence to which we have  been  referred  on  this  point
   comes from the CIPU report of October 2003, at paragraph 5.76, which  we
   shall set out:

   In the past individuals recruited as village guards have sometimes  been
   caught in the cross-fire.  On the one hand their  refusal  to  serve  as
   village guards could be interpreted as  implicit  support  for  the  PKK
   while on the other hand their acceptance of the office could  make  them
   PKK targets.  Since the withdrawal of PKK fighters from  Turkey  at  the
   end of 1999 there has been practically no further pressure to  speak  of
   from the PKK.  Now that the recruitment of  village  guards  has  ceased
   this issue is no longer of any great importance.  In the past refusal to
   serve as a village guard never  used  to  lead  to  sanctions  from  the
   national authority.  Pressure from local authorities  following  refusal
   to serve as a village guard can be avoided by  settling  elsewhere,  for
   instance in one of the major cities outside south-east Turkey. This also
   applies to persons who are  under  pressure  from  the  local  community
   because they agreed in the past to serve as a village guard.

19. In the light of that passage, it is clear that Mr  Naumann's  submission
   that the appellant's having absconded from village guard  service  would
   expose him to a real risk  from  the  authorities  at  the  airport,  on
   arrival in Turkey, must be regarded as not supported by anything in  the
   background evidence.  If there were any local risk at all, which must be
   doubtful at this distance in time, then the evidence shows that it could
   be avoided by relocation within Turkey.

That disposes of all the heads of the appellant's claim and  the  appeal  is
dismissed.
                                                                       [pic]
