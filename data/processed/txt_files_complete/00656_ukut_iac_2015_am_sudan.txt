Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI2008/269) we make an Anonymity  Order.   Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or

Representation

Appellant:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondent:   Mr M Mohzam, of Counsel, instructed by Burton and Burton
             Solicitors

(i)  Independent judicial research is  inappropriate.  It  is  not  for  the
    judge to assemble evidence. Rather, it is the  duty  of  the  judge  to
    decide each case on the basis of the evidence presented by the parties,
    duly infused, where appropriate, by the doctrine of judicial notice.

ii) If a judge is cognisant of something conceivably  material  which  does
    not form part of either party's case,  this  must  be  brought  to  the
    attention of the parties at the earliest  possible  stage,  which  duty
    could in principle extend beyond the hearing date.

iii) Judges are entitled to form provisional views in advance of  a  hearing
    provided that an open mind is conscientiously maintained.

iv) Footnotes to decisions of the Secretary of State are an  integral  part
    of the decision and, hence, may legitimately be considered and accessed
    by Tribunals.

 v) Fairness may require a Tribunal to canvas an issue which has  not  been
    ventilated by the parties or their representatives,  in  fulfilment  of
    each party's right to a fair hearing.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an asylum case in which the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (the "Secretary of State"), is the Appellant. The Respondent
    is a national of Sudan, aged 26 years.  By her decision dated 01  April
    2015 the Secretary of State refused the  Respondent's  application  for
    asylum.  The Respondent's ensuing appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (the "FtT") succeeded.  The appeal  was  allowed  on  both  asylum  and
    Article 3 ECHR grounds.

This Appeal

 2. The grant of permission to  appeal  to  this  Tribunal  recognises  the
    arguability of the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal, which can be
    linked to three separate passages in the FtT's decision.  These are, in
    turn:

     a) First, in [21], the Judge, having recorded the Secretary of State's
        view, expressed in the decision letter, that the Respondent's claim
        to be a member of a particular tribe, with an  associated  risk  of
        persecution, was inconsistent with Home Office information, stated:




             "I found this paragraph to be somewhat confused and unhelpful.
             I  accessed  the  background  information  relied  on  by  the
             Secretary of State as set out in the footnotes to the  refusal
             letter."


         The Judge then rehearsed the outcome of his  internet  researches,
    continuing:


             "The claimed inconsistency is not clarified  by  the  decision
             maker and I do not wish to speculate on what it might be  save
             that the Appellant's evidence is that he is both Shukriya  and
             a non-Arab."


         The consequential ground upon which permission to appeal  has  been
         granted entails a complaint that the Judge failed  to  disclose  to
         the parties that he had engaged in this research.


     b) In [24] -  [26]  of  the  decision,  the  Judge  addressed  certain
        discrepancies in the  Respondent's  asylum  claim  as  assessed  on
        behalf of the Secretary of State.  These related to a clash between
        local residents, including the Respondent, with a powerful  Sheikh,
        a  member  of  the  Sudanese  Government,  stimulated  by  a  local
        humanitarian crisis caused by a flooding river and the  importuning
        of the Sheikh  for  help.   The  Respondent's  case  was  that  his
        participation  in  these  events  precipitated  his  detention  and
        torture by the police.  In the decision letter,  the  Secretary  of
        State fastened onto a prima facie discrepancy in responses given by
        the  Respondent  relating  to  dates.   The  Judge   recorded   the
        Respondent's  explanation  in  both  his  witness   statement   and
        evidence, which was that an interpreter's error had occurred.   The
        Judge made a finding, in [24], that the Respondent had not received
        an audio recording of his interview.  In [25]  he  made  a  further
        finding, accepting the  Respondent's  evidence,  that  he  had  not
        claimed to have been arrested on a particular date.  In  [26],  the
        Judge reiterated  his  finding  that  the  reference  to  the  last
        mentioned date arose from a misinterpretation of  the  Respondent's
        responses during interview, stating:


             "There does appear to be some inconsistency but given  that  I
             am satisfied that [the controversial date] was  misinterpreted
             I am not satisfied that this inconsistency fatally  undermines
             the Appellant's credibility.  There has been a very high level
             of consistency in his account overall."


         The grant of permission to appeal, with specific reference to these
         passages, states:


             ".....  The Judge appeared to have formed a view on  the  core
             elements  of  the  Appellant's  asylum  claim  regarding   the
             Appellant's arrests and detention before hearing oral evidence
             from the Appellant [see 24  -  26]  or  submissions  from  the
             parties' representatives."


         It is necessary to juxtapose this with the relevant passage in  the
        grounds of appeal, which states:


              "It is submitted that the FtT Judge has erred procedurally in
              forming a view on core elements of the Appellant's  claim  in
              advance of the hearing ...   without  hearing  oral  evidence
              from the Appellant or  indeed  submissions  from  either  the
              party representing the Appellant and Respondent [sic]."

         This is followed by:

             "It is  submitted  that  this  materially  effects  [sic]  any
             subsequent assessment of credibility and the entirety  of  the
             findings thereafter at [50] - [59]."


     c) The third element of the grant of permission to appeal  focuses  on
        [31] of the decision of the FtT.  This is linked  to  [16]  of  the
        Secretary of State's decision  letter,  which  states  in  material
        part:


             "You have claimed to have been arrested a second  time,  after
             acquiring plastic bags to use for flood  defences.   You  were
             accused of attempting to monopolise the sugar market ....


             You have submitted no evidence in support ....


             Whilst it is accepted  that  Sudan  has  in  place  [an  anti-
             competition/monopoly law], it is not accepted that  possession
             of plastic bags is evidence of an attempt  to  monopolise  the
             sugar market ....


             This material fact remains unsubstantiated  and  therefore  is
             neither accepted nor rejects, but  will  be  considered  under
             Immigration Rule 339L."


         In [31], the Judge stated:


             "The Appellant is not claiming that  action  was  being  taken
             against  him  as  an  individual  by  the  State  under   this
             legislation whether legitimately or otherwise. I  can  see  no
             indication in the background evidence quoted to show that  the
             legislation is aimed at individuals rather than public bodies,
             corporations and/or governments.  In any event it would appear
             that the legislation referred to has  not  been  ratified  and
             there is no evidence to show that even if it  has  it  can  be
             used to prosecute individuals who are thought  to  be  rigging
             the market."


         The ground of appeal to which this passage gives rise  is  couched
    thus:


             "....  The Judge failed to inform the parties ..........  that
             he had concerns about the background materials relied upon  by
             the Respondent ...  [and] ....   to  give  the  Respondent  an
             opportunity to address such concerns at the hearing."

General

 3. We shall examine each of the grounds in turn.  Before doing so,  it  is
    appropriate to observe, as we did in our ex  tempore  decision  at  the
    conclusion of the hearing, that permission to appeal  should  not  have
    been granted in this case.   The  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  were
    based, in large measure, on the contention that  the  FtT  had  made  a
    series of findings in advance of the hearing.  This  was  nothing  more
    than bare, unsubstantiated assertion.  Mr Wilding,  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary  of  State,  did  not  dissent  from  this  analysis.    This
    contaminates both the grounds of appeal and the grant of permission  in
    large measure.  Second, as we shall explain in  further  detail  infra,
    the assertion in the grounds of appeal that the FtT  "engaged  in  pre-
    hearing research", without more, was misleading.  This too should  have
    been clear to the permission Judge.

The independent judicial research ground

 4. An  increasingly  familiar  feature  of  decisions  in  the  fields  of
    immigration and asylum is the inclusion  of  footnotes  with  links  to
    websites.  There were  nine  of  these  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision  in  the  present  case.  This  phenomenon  will  be   quickly
    recognised by both judges and practitioners.  The  FtT  Judge  did  not
    engage in some kind  of  independent  research  exercise.   Rather,  as
    stated unequivocally in [21] of the decision:

         "I accessed the background information relied on by  the  Secretary
         of State as set out in the footnotes to the refusal letter."

    This was an entirely legitimate exercise, since the Secretary of  State
    was relying on the source materials identified in  the  footnotes  and,
    further, the latter contained the outworkings of the pr�cis in the text
    of the decision.  This was distorted and misrepresented by the language
    used in the grounds of appeal, namely "pre-hearing  research".   It  is
    likely that the permission Judge was misled  in  consequence.  This  is
    unacceptable.

The predisposition ground

 5. We have addressed this in [3] above.  It has no  vestige  of  merit  or
    substance.

The non-disclosure ground

 6. This qualifies for the same analysis as the  ground  addressed  in  [3]
    above.  In short, in the decision letter, the Secretary of State relied
    on a measure of Sudanese legislation which was  specifically  mentioned
    in the refusal letter and upon which reliance was placed  in  rejecting
    the Respondent's asylum  application.  This  part  of  the  letter  was
    structured by the components of a pr�cis, a footnote and a  link  to  a
    website.   The Judge's finding was simplicity itself:

         "I do not regard this material as being relevant as it  is  assumed
         by the Secretary of State.  The  Appellant  is  not  claiming  that
         action was being taken against him as an individual  by  the  State
         under this legislation whether legitimately or otherwise."

    Two conclusions are appropriate. First,  applying  the  relevant  legal
    standards, this finding is unassailable.  Second, the taxonomy of "non-
    disclosure" by the Judge is wholly inappropriate.  To this we  add  the
    observation that the Judge's finding on this discrete issue  was,  duly
    analysed,  more  favourable  to  the  Secretary  of  State   than   the
    Respondent.

Conclusion

 7. We would emphasise that, fundamentally, each of the grounds  of  appeal
    is, properly, to be viewed and evaluated  through  the  prism  of  each
    party's inalienable right to  a  fair  hearing.  Bearing  in  mind  the
    context of this appeal, it is appropriate  to  formulate  some  general
    rules, or principles.  It is important  to  emphasise  that  these  are
    general in nature, given the unavoidable contextual and fact  sensitive
    nature of every case.

    (i)  Independent judicial research is inappropriate. It is not for  the
          judge to assemble evidence. Rather, it is the duty of the judge to
          decide each case on the basis of the  evidence  presented  by  the
          parties, duly infused,  where  appropriate,  by  the  doctrine  of
          judicial notice.


    (ii) If a judge is cognisant of certain evidence which  does  not  form
          part of either party's case, for example as  a  result  of  having
          adjudicated in another case or cases, or having  been  alerted  to
          something in the news media, the judge must proactively bring this
          evidence to the attention of the parties at the earliest  possible
          stage, unless satisfied that it has no conceivable bearing on  any
          of the issues  to  be  decided.   If  the  matter  is  borderline,
          disclosure should be made.  This duty may extend beyond  the  date
          of hearing, in certain contexts.

     iii) The assiduous judge who has invested time and effort  in  reading
          all of the documentary materials in advance  of  the  hearing  is
          entitled to form provisional views.  Provided that such views are
          provisional only and the judge conscientiously maintains an  open
          mind, no unfairness arises.


      iv) Footnotes to decisions of the Secretary of State are an  integral
          part of the decision and, hence, may legitimately  be  considered
          and accessed by Tribunals.

       v) If a judge  has  concerns  or  reservations  about  the  evidence
          adduced by either party which have not  been  ventilated  by  the
          parties  or  their  representatives,  these  may  require  to  be
          ventilated in fulfilment  of  the  "audi  alteram  partem"  duty,
          namely the obligation to ensure that each party has a  reasonable
          opportunity to put its case fully.  This duty may  extend  beyond
          the date of hearing, in certain contexts.  In this  respect,  the
          decision in Secretary  for  the  Home  Department  v  Maheshwaran
          [2002] EWCA Civ 173, at  [3]  -  [5]  especially,  on  which  the
          Secretary of State relied in argument, does  not  purport  to  be
          either prescriptive  or  exhaustive  of  the  requirements  of  a
          procedurally  fair  hearing.    Furthermore,   it   contains   no
          acknowledgement of the public law dimension and  the  absence  of
          any lis inter-partes.

DECISION

 8. We dismiss the appeal of the Secretary of State and affirm the decision
    of the FtT.
