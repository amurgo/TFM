Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Avery
For the Respondent:    Mr Jesurum

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I  will  refer  to
    the parties as they were identified at the First-tier hearing,  namely,
    the Secretary  of  State  will  from  herein  be  referred  to  as  the
    Respondent and Mr J.L. as the Appellant.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Algeria  born  in  1972.   He  appealed
    against a decision of the Respondent made on 8 October 2012  to  deport
    him pursuant to the automatic deportation provisions in Section  32  of
    the UK Borders Act 2007.

 3. The history appears not to  be  in  dispute.   He  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 11 December 2003, with the help of an agent, claiming asylum
    the next day giving a false name and date  of  birth.   His  claim  was
    refused on 10 February 2004.  He appealed, that appeal being  dismissed
    on 26 April 2004.  Permission to appeal the dismissal was  rejected  on
    24 August 2004, and his appeal rights were exhausted.

 4. On 6 September 2010 the Appellant was convicted at  Brent  Magistrates'
    Court  of  driving  a  motor  vehicle  with  excess  alcohol,  and  was
    disqualified for twelve months.  He was fined ï¿½200.

 5. On 17 January 2012 he was convicted at  Wolverhampton  Crown  Court  of
    threatening to damage or destroy own property so as to  endanger  life,
    for which he  was  sentenced  on  20  March  2012  to  fifteen  months'
    imprisonment.  On 20 March 2012 a  notice  of  liability  to  automatic
    deportation and questionnaire were faxed to the Appellant.  He returned
    the completed questionnaire on 12 April 2012.

 6. The Respondent in the refusal letter noted that the  case  fell  to  be
    considered under paragraph 398(b) of the  Immigration  Rules  and  that
    consideration had to be given to whether paragraph 399 or 399A applied.

 7. In considering paragraph 399(a) it was noted that the Appellant has two
    daughters, Miss A, aged 7, and Miss D, aged 5, both  British  citizens.
    It was accepted that it would be unreasonable to expect the children to
    leave the UK.  However, it was considered that there is another  family
    member who is able to care for them, their mother Ms I.S., who is their
    primary carer and with whom they currently reside.

 8. The Respondent noted letters  from  the  representatives  from  amongst
    others the mother in support of the Appellant and acknowledged that  he
    resided with the children prior  to  his  imprisonment  and  'may  have
    played a significant part in their daily lives' but  that  since  being
    imprisoned he had been apart from them.

 9. The Respondent noted claims that the deportation would have  a  'strong
    negative impact on the children'  but  considered  that  there  was  no
    evidence that the children's separation from their father would have  a
    detrimental effect on them other than would be expected  following  his
    imprisonment for 'threatening to damage or destroy own property  so  as
    to endanger life'.  Further, that his crime was committed  against  his
    partner and children and as a result the children were made the subject
    of a Child Protection Plan in May 2012 by Wolverhampton Social Services
    which remains in place.  The department's comment on 18 May  2012  that
    they believed that he was 'a risk  to  children  based  on  the  recent
    events that led to (his) arrest' was noted.

10. The Respondent noted that were he to be released  Social  Services  had
    concerns in July 2012 about him returning to the family address.   That
    view was reiterated later  that  month  following  an  application  for
    immigration bail.

11. The Respondent concluded that the children's best interests  were  that
    they should remain in the UK with their mother.

12. The Respondent also considered paragraph 399(b).  It was accepted  that
    he was in a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  Ms  I.S.,  a
    naturalised British citizen of Angolan descent.  However,  it  was  not
    accepted that the Appellant had been living in the UK with valid  leave
    continuously for at least the fifteen years immediately  preceding  the
    date of the immigration decision  or  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with  that  partner  being  able  to  continue
    outside the UK.  Ms I.S. could accompany the Appellant or if she wished
    to remain in the UK contact could be maintained  by  modern  electronic
    means and visits.

13. The Respondent  also  considered  paragraph  399A  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant's private life but noted that he had not lived in the UK  for
    at least twenty years immediately preceding the date of the immigration
    decision.  Also that he had spent his  youth  and  formative  years  in
    Angola and would be  able  successfully  to  reintegrate  into  Angolan
    society.

14. The Respondent  did  not  consider  that  there  were  any  exceptional
    circumstances under paragraph  397  such  as  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation.

15. He appealed, essentially, on the basis that his  removal  would  breach
    Article 8 on the  basis  of  his  relationship  with  his  partner  and
    daughters.

16. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 27 November 2013 before Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Onoufriou and Mrs Jordan (Non Legal Member) the
    Tribunal allowed the appeal to a limited extent.

17. They noted the Appellant's counsel's  request  for  an  application  to
    grant discretionary leave following the guidance of the Upper  Tribunal
    in RS (India) [2012] UKUT 00218 and heard submissions in that regard.

18. The Tribunal's findings are at paragraphs [16] to [18].  They noted the
    sentencing judge's comments regarding the offence:

         'I do not consider that there was at any time any intention on your
         part to set fire to this house, or to hurt your partner in that way
         or for that matter any children that were in the house.

         The whole thing got completely out of control.  It is  quite  clear
         from the statements that  (his  partner)  has  now  made  that  she
         regrets calling the police, although she was right to do so.   What
         she says in her letter is that you have spent long enough in prison
         and I agree with that.

         ...

         You  have  been  punished  enough  and  I  do  not  think   further
         supervision is going to help you.  What will help you is trying  to
         get on the rails with your family and your children and I know that
         you are determined to do that.

         You made a very serious mistake but you are not  a  danger  to  the
         public and you are not a fire raiser.'

19. The Tribunal concluded (at [17]) that the situation was not  one  where
    the Appellant had merely contrived a relationship with his children  in
    order to avoid deportation.  There was evidence of  the  family  living
    together before his imprisonment and of the children  visiting  him  in
    prison although these ceased as it was deemed  inappropriate.   He  had
    tried to resume contact with his family but  had  been  prevented  from
    doing so by Social Services who needed to produce an assessment of  the
    relationship and any risk if there was unsupervised contact.

20. It was also accepted that he had made a 'genuine  application'  to  the
    Family Court  for  contact  with  his  children  and  clearly  had  the
    intention of resubmitting the application (an application already  made
    having been rejected due to lack of court fees).

21. The Tribunal concluded that they were entirely satisfied that there was
    family life between the Appellant and his daughters  and  his  partner.
    Further, that the Family  Court  was  best  placed  to  determine  what
    contact he should have with  his  children,  and  that  following  such
    decision 'a more reasoned assessment can be made regarding  the  merits
    or otherwise of deporting the Appellant'.

22. Their decision (at [18]) states:

         'We find that the Appellant does have an Article 8 right to  remain
         in the UK until the conclusion of the intended  family  proceedings
         and we accordingly allow the appeal to a limited extent and  direct
         that the Appellant should be  granted  discretionary  leave  for  a
         period of three months to enable him to bring  contact  proceedings
         before the Family Court.  We do not consider it  would  be  in  the
         interests of justice and certainly not in the best interests of his
         children applying Section 55 of the 2009 Act, to deny the Appellant
         the  opportunity  to  resume  more  meaningful  contact  with   his
         children.'

23. The Respondent sought permission to appeal.  This  was  refused  on  31
    December 2013, a judge stating:

         ...

         'the second strand of  the  Respondent's  grounds  is  that  Social
         Services "will not allow" the Appellant  to  contact  his  children
         because they consider that he poses a risk to them and,  therefore,
         "any application for contact may in fact be futile and unlikely  to
         succeed".  Whilst that strand of argument  is  true  to  a  certain
         degree, it begs the question of what  the  outcome  of  the  family
         proceedings is likely to be if the Appellant is in  a  position  to
         pursue these proceedings.  It begs what,  in  paragraph  3  of  the
         headlines to RS (India), was referred to as the "core decision"  in
         the family proceedings, and does not undermine the reasoning of the
         Tribunal in the determination under consideration.

         That leaves the Respondent's case for permission dependent  on  the
         assertion that, in effect, the ratio in RS (India)  can  only  help
         Appellants where there are currently  ongoing  proceedings  in  the
         family courts.  In my assessment, that assertion is  contrary  both
         to the rationale and the wording of RS  (India).   On  my  reading,
         what was said in RS (India) can apply in a case, such as this  one,
         where no actual family proceedings  are  yet  in  process  but  are
         clearly intended to be put  in  process  in  short  order  (as  the
         Tribunal here found).  I refer, for example, to the  references  to
         contemplated family  proceedings  in  both  paragraph  43  and  the
         headnote of RS (India).'

24. The Respondent reapplied on identical grounds to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Giving permission to appeal an Upper Tribunal Judge stated:

         ...

         'Given the countervailing public interest  in  removing  those  who
         enter the United Kingdom without leave,  who  have  no  substantive
         right to remain under the Immigration Rules,  whose  asylum  claims
         have failed  and  who  have  committed  criminal  offences,  it  is
         arguably for the claimant to demonstrate that there is a  realistic
         prospect of proceedings in the Family Division/Court being launched
         and,  if  launched,  being   successful   thereby   requiring   the
         applicant's participation in them.'

25. At the error of law hearing before me Mr Avery  essentially  maintained
    the grounds.  The outcome of any proceedings were speculative.  Even if
    he succeeded in gaining contact rights it would  not  take  his  appeal
    against  deportation  forward.   His  conviction  had  involved  direct
    threats against his children.

26. Mr Jesurum's submission, in summary, was that it  was  clear  that  the
    Appellant intended to issue proceedings in the Family Court to increase
    contact with his children.  His first  attempt  failed  because,  being
    indigent, he did not have the fee.  The test was that proceedings  were
    contemplated.  Such was clearly the  case  here.   Indeed,  proceedings
    have now been started.  Social Services needed to be satisfied that  he
    was not a risk to his children and partner.   That was a matter for the
    Family Court.  The Tribunal was entitled to take the view that it would
    be helped by the court view on that matter and on  what  would  be  the
    best interests of the children.  There was no foregone conclusion  that
    proceedings  would  not  avail  the  Appellant.   Indeed,   there   was
    significant evidence including from the sentencing judge's remarks, the
    expert report of Professor Katona, and from his partner that he was  no
    longer a risk to his children.  The clear indication  was  that  Family
    Court proceedings were not a delaying tactic.

27. In considering this matter the Tribunal noted the guidance given in  RS
    (India).  There, the  Upper  Tribunal  indicated  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should either adjourn an immigration appeal or grant a  period
    of limited leave where there are Family Court proceedings, the  outcome
    of which was likely to be material to the immigration decision,  unless
    it appears that these proceedings have only been  instituted  to  delay
    immigration action or removal is otherwise inevitable.

28. I note that the Court of Appeal endorsed this approach in Mohan v  SSHD
    [2012] EWCA Civ 1363.

29. In the instant case the Tribunal correctly found that the Appellant had
    not in fact begun proceedings in the Family Court for contact with  his
    children but that  he  had  made  a  'genuine  application'  which  was
    rejected due to lack of court fees  but  that  it  was  'clearly  [his]
    intention to resubmit the application'.

30. The ratio in RS (India) (per the headnote and paragraph 43)  can  apply
    in a case such as this one where  no  family  proceedings  are  yet  in
    progress but are clearly intended to be put in process in  short  order
    as the Tribunal in the instant case found.  The Tribunal  was  entitled
    on the evidence before it to find that  proceedings  were  contemplated
    and that there was a  realistic  prospect  of  such  proceedings  being
    launched.

31. I note that at the hearing before me proof  that  the  application  had
    been made and the fee paid was provided.

32. The Tribunal in addressing the relevant questions raised in RS  (India)
    found that it was 'quite clear that this is not a situation where  (he)
    has merely contrived a relationship with his children in order to avoid
    deportation'.

33. It concluded that the outcome of the  contemplated  family  proceedings
    are likely to be material to the immigration decision:

         'We are quite satisfied that  there  is  family  life  between  the
         Appellant and his daughters and ... his partner  ...   We  consider
         that the Family Court is best placed to determine what contact  the
         Appellant should have with his children and  following  the  Family
         Court's decision a more reasoned assessment can be  made  regarding
         the merits or otherwise of deporting the Appellant.'

34. It concluded that there were no compelling public interest  reasons  to
    exclude the claimant from the UK irrespective of  the  outcome  of  the
    family proceedings or the best interests of the child:

         'We do not consider it would be in the  interests  of  justice  and
         certainly not in the best interests of  his  children  in  applying
         Section 55 ... to deny the Appellant the opportunity to resume more
         meaningful contact with his children.'

35. The Tribunal also found that the Appellant has  had  previous  interest
    in, and contact with, his children and that  he  had  tried  to  resume
    contact with his family following his release.

36. The Tribunal also took heed of the sentencing judge's remarks:

         'You  have  been  punished  enough  and  I  do  not  think  further
         supervision is going to help you.  What will help you is trying  to
         get on the rails with your family and your children and I know that
         you are determined to do that ...'

37. The Tribunal made findings on the evidence that they were  entitled  to
    reach.

38. The Tribunal concluded that the Appellant had an  Article  8  right  to
    remain  in  the  UK  until  the  conclusion  of  the  intended   family
    proceedings and that it was  appropriate  to  allow  the  appeal  to  a
    limited extent and a discretionary leave be granted.

39. I see no material error of law in the Tribunal's decision.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows no material error of  law  and
the decision allowing the appeal to the limited extent stated, stands.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration
Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
