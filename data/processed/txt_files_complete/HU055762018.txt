For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction:

      1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar (hereinafter referred  to  as  the
         "FtTJ") promulgated on the 20 November 2019.

      2. By his decision, the Judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal against
         the Respondent's decision dated 12 February 2018 refusing his human
         rights claim, made in the context of an application for  indefinite
         leave to remain based on long residence. The Respondent refused the
         application on the basis that the Appellant had misrepresented  his
         earnings as between those declared to the Home  Office  in  earlier
         applications for leave to  remain  and  as  declared  to  HMRC,  in
         particular in the years 2009-2010 and 2010-11.

      3. The Respondent therefore refused the  application  under  paragraph
         322(5) of the Immigration Rules ("Paragraph 322(5)") on  the  basis
         that the Appellant's presence in the UK was undesirable due to  his
         character and conduct.

      4. The FtTJ did not make an anonymity order  and  no  application  was
         made for such an order before the Upper Tribunal.

      5. The hearing took place on 23 April 2021,  by  means  of  Skype  for
         Business. which has been consented to and not object1d  to  by  the
         parties. A face- to- face hearing was not held because it  was  not
         practicable, and both parties  agreed  that  all  issues  could  be
         determined in a remote hearing. The advocates attended remotely via
         video as did the appellant  who  was  able  to  see  and  hear  the
         proceedings being conducted. There were no issues regarding  sound,
         and no technical problems were encountered during the hearing and I
         am satisfied both advocates were  able  to  make  their  respective
         cases by the chosen means.

      6. I am grateful to Mr Gajjar and Mr  Diwnycz  for  their  clear  oral
         submissions.

Background:

      7. The appellant is a national  of  Pakistan.  He  first  entered  the
         United Kingdom on 17 October 2006, on the basis of a  student  visa
         which was valid from 10 October 2006 until 30  November  2008.  The
         appellant's leave was extended on a number of occasions  thereafter
         until March 21, 2016.

      8. On 17 March 2016 he applied for indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a
         Tier 1 (General) migrant but later varied this  to  an  application
         for indefinite  leave  to  remain  under  paragraph  276B  on  long
         residence grounds.

      9.  On  12th  February  2018,  the  application  was  refused  by  the
         respondent under paragraph 322 (5) on the basis that the  appellant
         failed to disclose his  true  earnings  to  HMRC  for  his  Tier  1
         application lodged  on  December  23,  2010.  The  decision  letter
         identifies the years 2009/2010 and  2010/2011.  As  a  result,  his
         application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  long  residence
         grounds was also refuse the same reasons under paragraph 276B  (ii)
         and (iii).

     10. The appellant appealed the refusal and reference was  made  to  his
         former accountants having  negligently/incompetently  prepared  his
         tax returns.

     11. The appeal was heard by the FtT  on  11  December  2018  who  in  a
         decision promulgated on 9 January  2019  dismissed  the  appeal  by
         rejecting the appellant's claim that he had not been provided  with
         either draft or final accounts checked by the former accountants.

     12. Permission was sought to appeal this decision and  whilst  the  FtT
         refused permission, the Upper Tribunal granted  permission  on  the
         ground that it was arguable that the judge had failed  to  keep  in
         his mind when analysing the evidence that the respondent  bore  the
         burden of proof in establishing dishonesty.

     13. The appeal came before the Upper Tribunal (Deputy Judge  Alis)  who
         in a determination promulgated on 1 May 2019 reached the conclusion
         that the decision of the FtTJ involved the making of an error on  a
         point of law and identified  at  [29]  that  the  judge  failed  to
         address the fact that the P 60s did not total the amount  submitted
         in the tax return which brought  into  question  what  figures  the
         accountant submitted and whilst the judge criticised the  appellant
         for  producing  no  evidence  from  the  former  accountant,   this
         overlooked the fact that the firm had  been  dissolved  in  January
         2015. The judge also accepted that the accountants may have "messed
         up the previous year's accounts (2009 - 2010) and was a discrepancy
         was larger, the expense explanation was the  same  for  the  second
         year as it was the first". The judge therefore concluded  that  the
         issues raised went to the "core of the assessment" and  thus  found
         material errors of law. Judge Alis remitted the appeal to the First-
         tier Tribunal to be reheard again.

The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal:

     14. The appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision to  refuse
         leave came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Khawar) on  the  4
         September 2019.

     15. In a determination promulgated on the 20 November  2019,  the  FtTJ
         dismissed the appeal on human  rights  grounds,  having  considered
         that issue in the light of  the  appellant's  compliance  with  the
         Immigration Rule in question and on Article 8 grounds.

     16. The FtTJ considered  the  evidence  relating  to  the  issue  under
         Paragraph 322  (5)  at  paragraphs  [22-39].  In  relation  to  the
         relevant tax year 2009/2010  the  FtTJ  did  not  accept  that  the
         previous judge had made a finding that he  was  not  dishonest  but
         concluded that the period appeared to have been disregarded by  the
         appellant and also the respondent and thus he also disregarded  the
         same because there was no evidence in relation to  it.  Nonetheless
         he did not conclude that the appellant was not dishonest  for  that
         year (at [22]).

     17.  The  FtTJ  therefore  concentrated  on  the  discrepancy  in   the
         appellant's tax return for 2010/2011. He set out that the appellant
         had initially declared a  total  income  of  �20,356  and  that  in
         January 2016 the appellant  amended  these  figures  by  filing  an
         amended tax return declaring self-employment of  �30,413  and  PAYE
         employment of �11,007.94 and claimed  an  additional  �21,851.  The
         judge  noted  "this  amendment  effectively  bought  the  appellant
         declared earnings to HMRC more in line with those city  claims  the
         Home Office as part of his Tier 1 application."

     18. The FtTJ went on to consider the issue as to whether the  appellant
         was aware at the time that his tax return was filed  at  the  false
         figures/discrepant figures were filed.  The  appellant's  case  was
         that he did not know  what  figures  had  been  filed  because  the
         accountants did not provided with a copy  of  the  tax  return  was
         filed and did not have to sign tax return because it was  one  that
         was failed online without any reference to him.

     19. The FtTJ considered the explanations  given  by  the  appellant  by
         reference to his former accountants but rejected  that  account  at
         pargraphs [28 - 30] stating that it was  highly  unlikely  that  he
         would not have been told how much tax he was required to  pay,  and
         that given his background as a business consultant  he  would  have
         been aware that his income self-employment would be  taxed  at  the
         same rate as PAYE income  (at  paragraph  [31]).   The  judge  took
         against the appellant for his failure to be able to work out 20% of
         �30,000 (at [32]) and at [33]-[35], the  FtTJ  concluded  that  the
         appellant's evidence about the error and how it came to  light  was
         undermined by the fact that his  present  accountants  appeared  to
         indicate that the appellant was already aware of  discrepancies  in
         his tax returns.

     20. When considering the evidence concerning the former solicitors (the
         evidence demonstrating that they were struck off in 2015) the  FtTJ
         did not consider that this assisted the appellant and  that  if  he
         provided his business records it is difficult to see how they could
         have failed to declare all of the self-employed income and that the
         new solicitors did not say how the error could  have  occurred  (at
         [36]). The FtTJ took into account  the  appellant's  qualifications
         and employment but on the totality of the evidence he was satisfied
         that the respondent discharged the burden  of  proof  to  establish
         that the appellant had used dishonesty (at [38]-[39]).

     21. The FtTJ therefore dismissed the appeal.

     22. Permission to appeal was issued and on 1 May  2020,  permission  to
         appeal was granted by FtTJ O'Keefe.

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal:

     23. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the  Upper  Tribunal  issued
         directions on the 6 August 2020, inter alia, indicating that it was
         provisionally of the view that the error  of  law  issue  could  be
         determined  without  a  face-  to-  face  hearing.  The   appellant
         submitted written  submissions  on  29  August  2020  but  with  no
         compliance on behalf of the  respondent.  Further  directions  were
         given for a remote hearing to take place and that this  could  take
         place via Skype. Both parties have indicated that they were content
         for the hearing to proceed by this method. Therefore, the  Tribunal
         listed the hearing to enable oral submissions to be given  by  each
         of the parties with the assistance of their advocates.

     24. Mr Gajjar on behalf  of  the  appellant  relied  upon  the  written
         grounds of appeal and the written submissions dated 29 August 2020.



     25. There  has  been  no  written  response  filed  on  behalf  of  the
         respondent.

     26. I also heard oral submission from the advocates, and I am  grateful
         for their assistance and their clear oral submissions.

     27. The relevant legal provisions are as follows.

     28. The power to grant leave to enter or remain  arises  under  section
         3(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 ("the 1971 Act"), which provides:

             "Except as otherwise provided by or under this Act, where a
             person is not a British citizen;

             (a)  he shall not enter the United Kingdom unless given leave
             to do so in accordance with the provisions of, or made under,
             this Act;

             (b)  he may be given leave to enter the United Kingdom (or,
             when already there, leave to remain in the United Kingdom)
             either for a limited or for an indefinite period."

     29. The Immigration Rules set out the way in  which  the  Secretary  of
         State would exercise his power under section 3(1) of the 1971  Act.
         The Immigration Rules are  made  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and
         approved by Parliament under section 3(2) of the 1971 Act.

     30. Paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules provides:

             "The requirements to be met by  an  applicant  for  indefinite
             leave to remain on the ground of long residence in the  United
             Kingdom are that:

             (i)(a)  he  has  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
             residence in the United Kingdom.

             (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons
             why it would be undesirable for him  to  be  given  indefinite
             leave to remain on the ground of long residence,  taking  into
             account his:

             (a) age; and

             (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and

             (c)   personal   history,   including   character,    conduct,
             associations, and employment record; and

             (d) domestic circumstances; and

             (e) compassionate circumstances; and

             (f) any representations received on the person's behalf; and

             (iii) the applicant  does  not  fall  for  refusal  under  the
             general grounds for refusal.

             (iv) the applicant has demonstrated  sufficient  knowledge  of
             the English language and sufficient knowledge  about  life  in
             the United Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.

             (v) the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
             immigration laws except that any period of overstaying  of  28
             days or less will  be  disregarded,  as  will  any  period  of
             overstaying between periods of entry clearance, leave to enter
             or leave to remain  of  up  to  28  days  and  any  period  of
             application made within that 28 day period."

     31. Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules provides:

             "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation  of  leave  to
             enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  should  normally  be
             refused.

             ...

             (5) the undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security.

     32. There are six grounds advanced on behalf of the appellant. They can
         be summarised as follows.

     33. Ground 1 asserts that the FtTJ failed to engage with the submission
         that the appellant had no case to answer as the decision letter  of
         12th February 2018 did not make an allegation  that  the  appellant
         had been dishonest to either of  the  two  government  departments.
         This was a submission that was advanced on the  appellant's  behalf
         are set out in the original skeleton argument (at paragraph 5).

     34. Ground 2 challenges paragraph [22] of the decision of the FtTJ.  By
         reference to the decision, it  is  submitted  that  the  final  two
         sentences of that paragraph demonstrate an error of law. The  judge
         disregarded the position for 2009/2010 but further stated  that  he
         did not conclude that the appellant  was  not  dishonest.  In  this
         respect, the judge failed to apply the correct burden of  proof  to
         assess whether Secretary of State had made out  that  there  was  a
         significant discrepancy regarding the 2009/10 return in order for a
         suspicion of dishonesty to arise (paragraph 42 of Balajigari).

     35. It is further submitted that it was irrational  for  the  judge  to
         conclude that Judge Beach had not found in favour of the  appellant
         regarding 2009/10. The judge did not reach a  neutral  finding  but
         found that dishonesty had not been made out.  Whilst  the  decision
         was set aside by the UK, the positive findings  had  not  been  the
         subject of challenge by either party and the judge  had  identified
         factors which the judge in the present case had overlooked  in  his
         assessment. Notwithstanding those  matters,  the  judge  failed  to
         consider the various factors raised  as  part  of  the  appellant's
         innocent explanations as to why there had been no dishonesty on his
         part. They were set out in the skeleton argument at paragraph 7.

     36. Ground  3  asserts  that  there  was  procedural  unfairness  again
         relating to paragraph [22] where the judge recorded that  2009/2010
         had been disregarded by the respondent  but  notwithstanding  this,
         the judge stated that he did not find that the  appellant  was  not
         dishonest. This is arguably materially contaminated the  subsequent
         findings. A further procedural unfairness arose from [32] when  the
         judge held against the appellant the period of silence in  response
         to the  basic  question  set  out  at  that  paragraph.  The  judge
         attributed silence to the fact that the appellant was  fully  aware
         that 20% of �30,000 was �6000 meaning the tax payment he made �3000
         is considerably less. The appellant had provided a  statement  with
         the permission application concerning the  circumstances.  In  this
         respect the judge contravened the guidance given by  the  Court  of
         Appeal in R (SS  (Sri  Lanka)  v  SSHD  [2018)  EWCA  Civ  1391  at
         paragraphs 36 - 37.

     37. Ground 4 submits that the judge overlooked the material aspects  of
         his innocent explanation. They are set out in detail  by  reference
         to the appellant's bundle at paragraphs 13.1-13.6 of  the  skeleton
         argument.

     38. Ground 5 submits that the judge reached irrational  conclusions  by
         reference to paragraphs [30], [29] and [33 - 35].

     39. Ground 6 asserts  that  the  judge  failed  to  apply  the  correct
         standard of proof at [36] when dealing  with  the  claim  that  the
         accountant's conduct was  so  poor  that  they  were  subjected  to
         various actions by the Companies Register (see  appellant's  bundle
         D5 - D8) before being struck off in 2015. The judge dismissed  this
         aspect of the innocent explanation by  finding  that  it  was  "not
         necessarily the case as a matter of course" that they would make  a
         mistake in relation to the  appellant's  tax  returns  given  their
         dilatory conduct of their own affairs. The finding was made without
         any regard to the errors made in relation to the PAYE  income.  The
         key point is that no combination of the 3  P60's  provided  to  the
         accountants could have led to the total of �7093 as his accountants
         declared to HMRC which went to highlight their incompetence.

     40. In his oral submissions Mr Gajjar carefully went  through  each  of
         the grounds at length and did so by  reference  to  the  bundle  of
         documents that was before the FtTJ to demonstrate that the decision
         of the FtTJ involved  the  making  of  an  error  of  law.  At  the
         conclusion of  those  submissions  Mr  Diwnycz  in  behalf  of  the
         respondent informed the Tribunal that having read, listened to  the
         submissions, and having  considered  them,  he  conceded  that  the
         grounds were made out and that the decision demonstrated the making
         of an error on a point of law and therefore  could  not  stand  and
         should be set  aside.  When  later  asked  to  clarify  whether  he
         conceded Ground 1 which related to the failure of the respondent to
         raise an allegation of dishonesty within the  decision  letter,  he
         confirmed that the issue of dishonesty was not a point made in  the
         decision letter and that the other elements set out in the  grounds
         supported  his  contention  relating  to  ground  1.  Therefore  he
         conceded that ground 1 was also made out.

     41. Having made that concession, I invited the parties to address me as
         to the materiality of the other errors set out in  the  grounds  if
         ground 1 was made out. Mr Gajjar submitted that ground 1 was  based
         on the failure to raise the issue of dishonesty  and  the  decision
         letter therefore it followed that there was  no  dishonest  conduct
         that  would  support  the  decision  taken  overall.  He  therefore
         submitted that the  decision  should  be  set  aside  and  for  the
         Tribunal to remake the appeal  by  allowing  the  appeal  on  human
         rights grounds. He further submitted that  the  appellant  met  the
         requirements of 10 years lawful continuous residence and  that  the
         only issues raised in the decision letter was under paragraph  276B
         (ii) and (iii) and that if the issue of dishonesty fell  away,  the
         appellant therefore met the requirements  for  long  residence.  Mr
         Diwnycz was in agreement with that submission.

     42. Given the concession made in behalf of the respondent,  it  is  not
         necessary for me to set out full reasons as to why the decision  of
         the FtTJ should be set aside  having  demonstrated  the  making  an
         error on a point of law. I shall briefly summarise them.

     43. In relation to ground 2, the grounds identify paragraph [22] of the
         FtTJ's decision where it is submitted  that  the  judge  reached  a
         contradictory finding. I have considered  paragraph  [22]  and  the
         earlier decision of Judge Beach.

     44. Having done so, whilst I do not  accept  the  submission  that  the
         finding of  Judge Beach was determinative/binding on the FtTJ given
         that no factual findings  were  preserved  by  the  Upper  Tribunal
         relating to the tax year 2009/2010, I am satisfied that  the  judge
         was in error in  his  assessment.  The  FtTJ  identified  that  the
         appellant was not cross-examined about the tax year  2009/2010  and
         also identified that the period had been "disregarded by  not  only
         appellant but also the respondent". The judge then went on to state
         "I also disregard the  same  because  I  simply  do  not  have  any
         evidence in relation  thereto".  However  whilst  all  the  parties
         appeared to disregard that period,  the  judge  went  on  to  state
         "however, I do not conclude that the appellant was not  dishonest."
         In reaching that view, the judge gave no reasons for  reaching  the
         conclusion and did not factor in his own earlier  finding  that  he
         had disregarded consideration of that tax year. I  agree  with  the
         submission made  by  Mr  Gajjar  that  the  two  elements  of  that
         paragraph do not sit well together. It  was  of  importance  in  my
         judgement because if there was no discrepancy in one tax  year,  it
         was evidence that could potentially undermine the  claim  that  the
         under declarations for the other tax year were dishonest.

     45. Whilst ground 3 relies on procedural unfairness in relation to  the
         assessment made at paragraph [22],  I  do  not  consider  that  the
         argument that the judge was procedurally unfair adds anything  more
         to the submissions made in respect of ground 2. Nor do  I  consider
         that the judge was procedurally unfair by asking the  appellant  to
         calculate 20% of �30,000 (see [32]). Whilst  the  submissions  made
         refer to this being contrary to the decision SS (Sri Lanka)  in  my
         judgement this was not a matter of demeanour but the  judge  taking
         into account whether the appellant could properly answer a question
         that could reasonably be have expected to have been answered. I  am
         not satisfied that there was any procedural unfairness in  the  way
         the grounds and submission set out.

     46. However, in relation to grounds 4 - 6, I am satisfied that the FtTJ
         failed to  take  into  account  evidence  that  was  relevant  when
         considering the issue of dishonesty  and  the  correct  burden  and
         standard of proof. At [36], the judge made reference to  the  claim
         made on behalf of the appellant that his  former  accountants  were
         negligent or incompetent in relation to his affairs. The judge when
         considering that submission stated "this  is  not  necessarily  the
         case as a matter of course. If the appellant had provided  all  his
         business records to Shabester it is difficult to see how they could
         have failed to declared all of the self-employed income."  However,
         as Mr Gajjar submits, the bundle provides documentary  evidence  to
         demonstrate strike of actions by the companies register  which  led
         to  their  eventual  striking  off  in  2015.  In  support  of  the
         appellant's claim concerning their conduct, reference was  made  in
         the documentary evidence before the FtT  to  the  PAYE  income  for
         2010/11. Having been provided with the P60's relevant  to  the  tax
         year, the income was �11,794 (taken from the three documents)  when
         they in fact declared �7093 to HMRC (see the document at C9).  This
         was evidence in support of the  appellant's  claim  concerning  his
         accountants which had not been taken into  account.  As  Mr  Gajjar
         submits, no combination of the three P60's could have  led  to  the
         figure of  �7093  is  declared  in  the  documents  and  thus  this
         supported the argument advanced on behalf of the  appellant  as  to
         the quality of  the  calculations.  The  submission  was  important
         because under declaring PAYE would not have put  the  appellant  in
         any position to gain any advantage when tax  was  already  paid  at
         source.

     47.  Furthermore  in  relation  to  those  grounds,  in  assessing  the
         allegations, it was necessary to look at the wider picture overall.
         Relevant to the issues in this case  was  that  the  appellant  had
         overpaid tax to HMRC in the  years  2013/2014  and  2015/2016.  The
         figures given for those overpayments in the documents were  figures
         of  �1888.40  (2013/14)  and  �405.60  (2015  -  2016)   and   were
         significant overpayments. There were also sums of money in relation
         to corporation tax in behalf of the company for which  he  was  the
         sole director. The figures given by counsel from the documents  are
         �709.80, �54.76, �1014, �2523.20, �880.15, 542.49.

     48. In addition to the evidence that had  been  overlooked,  Mr  Gajjar
         pointed to the letter from the  HMRC.  Whilst  the  judge  at  [39]
         concluded that HMRC by not imposing a  penalty  appellant  did  not
         mean that he had not acted dishonestly. The  difficulty  with  that
         finding is that no reference was made to  the  letter  provided  by
         HMRC which assessed the appellant's conduct and  considered  it  to
         constitute a "failure to take reasonable  care"  and  therefore  no
         penalty  was  levied.  In  the  light  of  the  guidance  given  in
         Balajigari at [73 - 74] the letter and  its  contents  were  highly
         relevant to the issues under consideration.

     49. Other evidence that was relevant was the failure  to  consider  the
         appellant's history in  subsequent  years.  No  discrepancies  were
         indicated in the documents which related to his earnings from self-
         employment.

     50. Whilst I have set out above the  errors  of  law  set  out  in  the
         grounds 2-6, as Mr Gajjar has identified, given the  concession  as
         to ground 1, this effectively disposes of the other grounds in  any
         event because ground 1 goes to the heart of whether  the  issue  of
         dishonesty was properly raised.

     51. Ground 1 concerns the submission made  to  the  Tribunal  that  the
         appellant had no case to answer as there had been no allegation  of
         dishonesty in the decision letter with the  effect  that  paragraph
         322 (5) of the rules has no effect.

     52. Mr Diwnycz accepted that the decision letter and its terms  do  not
         properly raise the issue of dishonesty.

     53. The language of the decision letter makes no clear reference to the
         appellant being dishonest in his  tax  affairs.  Reference  in  the
         decision letter refers to the delay in correcting his  declarations
         to indicate "you had little  intention  of  correcting  the  errors
         promptly and as such so little respect for UK tax laws."  Reference
         is made to "it would not be considered a credible explanation"  and
         when expressly dealing with paragraph 322 (5) the decision  letters
         states "the Secretary of State considers it will be undesirable for
         you to remain in the United Kingdom in light of your character  and
         conduct. She satisfied that you have misrepresented  your  earnings
         at various times...". There is also reference to the  appellant  as
         the income raised to an application as being "clearly inflated".

     54.  In  order  for  paragraph  322  (5)  to  apply,  dishonesty  is  a
         prerequisite. This set out at paragraphs [34-[35] of Balajigari :

             "34. As to the first stage, Mr Biggs submitted that there  are
             three limbs to the  analysis.  There  must  be:  (i)  reliable
             evidence of (ii) sufficiently reprehensible conduct; and (iii)
             an  assessment,  taking  proper  account   of   all   relevant
             circumstances  known  about  the  applicant  at  the  date  of
             decision, of  whether  his  or  her  presence  in  the  UK  is
             undesirable (this should include evidence of positive features
             of their character). Again, that seems to  us  a  correct  and
             helpful analysis of the exercise required at the first  stage,
             but it will be useful to say something more about the elements
             in it, especially as they apply  to  an  earnings  discrepancy
             case.

             35.  As to the first two limbs, Mr Biggs' position was that an
             earnings  discrepancy  case  could   constitute   sufficiently
             reprehensible conduct for the purpose of paragraph 322 (5)  if
             but only if the discrepancy was the result  of  dishonesty  on
             the part of the applicant. That was not disputed on behalf  of
             the Secretary of State, and in our view  it  is  correct.  The
             provision of inaccurate earnings figures either to HMRC or  to
             the Home Office in support of an application for  leave  under
             Part 6A as a result of mere carelessness or ignorance or  poor
             advice cannot constitute conduct rendering it undesirable  for
             the applicant to remain in  the  UK.  Errors  so  caused  are,
             however regrettable, "genuine" or "innocent" in the sense that
             they are honest, and do not meet the necessary threshold. This
             is the approach already taken by the  UT:  see  R  (Samant)  v
             Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  (JR/6546/2016,
             judgment of 26 April 2017), at para. 10, per Collins J, and  R
             (Shahbaz Khan) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
             [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC), at paras. 32-37, per Martin  Spencer  J
             (we shall have to  return  to  Shahbaz  Khan  in  more  detail
             below).

     55. At paragraphs 211- 212 of Balajigari,  the  Court  of  Appeal  made
         reference to the decision letter under challenge and that they  did
         not use language relevant to indicate dishonesty as  being  alleged
         but rather a "lesser threshold" which was the wrong test  and  fell
         short of a finding of dishonesty. Those paragraphs read as follows:

             "211.    We are, however, very troubled by the  terms  of  the
             Reasons given for both decisions. In neither  set  of  Reasons
             does the Secretary of State in terms that  he  has  found  the
             discrepancies to be the result  of  dishonesty.  Instead,  the
             Reasons for the administrative review decision repeatedly  use
             language which suggests a lesser threshold. In  the  first  of
             the  passages  quoted  at  para.  201  above  they  refer   to
             "undesirable conduct", which is plainly the  wrong  test;  the
             succeeding passages are couched in terms of the  Secretary  of
             State's "doubt" and "concerns"; and the final  passage  quoted
             "deems" (which is an odd word in  this  context)  Mr  Albert's
             conduct to have been "questionable", which is certainly  short
             of a finding of dishonesty.

             212. We fully acknowledge that some of the other  passages  in
             both sets of Reasons would appear clearly to imply  a  finding
             of dishonesty - specifically, the rejection of the explanation
             of "genuine error" and the observations to the effect that  Mr
             Albert had a motive to submit "false" figures -  and  we  have
             considered anxiously whether the  correct  view,  reading  the
             Reasons as a whole, is that it is sufficiently clear that  the
             Secretary of State did find dishonesty and that  the  passages
             suggesting otherwise simply represent loose language: we  have
             to say that these letters generally  are  poorly  drafted.  We
             have come to the conclusion, however,  that  it  is  at  least
             seriously arguable that there was a  substantive  misdirection
             here. If, as we have held above, paragraph 322 (5) can only be
             relied on by the Secretary  of  State  where  he  has  made  a
             positive finding of dishonesty, we regard it as important that
             it be quite clear that such a finding has  indeed  been  made:
             there may perhaps be cases where that is indeed clear even  if
             the words "dishonest" or "deceit" are not actually  used,  but
             the benefit of any doubt must go to the applicant. Quite apart
             from anything else, using  the  right  language  ensures  that
             caseworkers face up to the seriousness  of  the  finding  that
             they are making. In our view there is a real doubt here  about
             whether the caseworkers understood what they had to find."

     56. When applied to the decision letter in this appeal, the submissions
         made by Mr Gajjar which were conceded on behalf of the  respondent,
         were that the language used was similar to  that  in  the  decision
         letters in the decision of Balajigari and whilst the language might
         be said to imply a finding of dishonesty, and reference being  made
         to "genuine error", that there was a misdirection and  no  positive
         finding of dishonesty was made. This was a  decision  made  in  the
         context of judicial review proceedings.  I  further  note  in  this
         regard that the decision in Balajigari was handed down on 16  April
         2019 and whilst that was after the decision letter in this  appeal,
         no revised or amended decision letter has been  served,  even  when
         the appeal had been before the FtT on two previous occasions.

     57. As there is no positive allegation of dishonesty made  in  relation
         to the appellant, it  follows  that  there  was  no  case  for  the
         appellant to answer and thus it was not necessary  to  provide  any
         innocent explanation.

     58. For those reasons and as the parties agree, the decision of the
         FtTJ did involve the making of an error on a point of law and the
         decision should be set aside.

     59. There is no dispute between the parties that the appellant met the
         requirements of paragraph 276B and that the only issues that were
         in dispute relate to the issue of conduct which has now been
         resolved as set out above. As he meets the requirements of the
         Immigration Rules pertaining to his human rights application, his
         human rights appeal is allowed (applying TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA
         Civ 1109.

     60. The appeal is remade as follows; the appeal is allowed on Article 8
         grounds.
