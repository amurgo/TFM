                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  Kenya  born  on  15th  July  1983.  His
    appeal, against the Secretary of State's decision dated 5th August 2014
    refusing to issue a permanent residence card under Regulation 15, 8 and
    6 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, was  dismissed  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Hanbury in a  decision  promulgated  on  9th  March
    2015.

2.   The Judge found that the  durable  relationship  for  the  purposes  of
    calculating the five years must have commenced in late  2005  or  early
    2006. He  found  that  there  was  no  dispute  that  the  Sponsor  was
    exercising Treaty rights from January 2006 to May 2007, but  there  was
    substantial dispute over the first period of unemployment from May 2007
    to June 2008. The Judge did not  accept  that  the  Sponsor  was  self-
    employed from June 2008 to November 2009 and therefore it did not count
    towards the five year period. The Judge concluded  that  the  Appellant
    was unable to satisfy  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  [the
    Regulations] for permanent residence in the UK.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Frankish
    on 9th June 2015 on the grounds that the Judge had failed to appreciate
    that the EEA Sponsor had achieved a permanent right of residence and he
    wrongly started the clock running again with the start of  cohabitation
    in late 2005 or early 2006.

4.   At the hearing, it was agreed by the parties that the EEA  Sponsor  had
    a permanent right of residence. It was conceded at the  appeal  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal that  she  had  been  exercising  Treaty
    rights from 2001 to 2007. Accordingly, the Judge had erred  in  law  in
    his application of the Regulations.

5.   The Appellant married the Sponsor on 6th May 2006  and  applied  for  a
    permanent residence card on 1st February 2012. The Appellant  is  still
    married to the Sponsor and they have two children.

6.   Under Regulation  14  a  family  member  of  an  EEA  national  with  a
    permanent right of residence under Regulation 15 is entitled to  reside
    in the UK for as long as he  remains  the  family  member  of  the  EEA
    national.

7.   Under Regulation 15 a family member of  an  EEA  national  who  is  not
    himself an EEA national but who has resided in  the  UK  with  the  EEA
    national in accordance with the Regulations for a continuous period  of
    five years shall acquire the right to reside in the UK permanently.

8.   Accordingly, I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law  in
    his application of the Regulations and in requiring the Sponsor to show
    that she was still exercising Treaty rights after she  had  acquired  a
    permanent right of residence. I set aside the decision dated 9th  March
    2015 and remake it.

9.   The Appellant satisfies the requirements of  Regulation  15(1)  of  the
    Regulations and has  acquired  a  permanent  right  of  residence.  The
    Appellant's appeal is allowed under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
