                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Bowler  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  20
    September 2016) dismissing her appeal against the decision of an  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance  as  the  spouse  of  a
    British national.   The  sole  ground  of  refusal  was  asserted  non-
    compliance with the financial requirement  of  the  sponsor  having  an
    annual income  of  at  least  �18,600  ("the  MIR"),  and  the  related
    evidential requirements contained in Appendix  FM-SE.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that the appellant requires anonymity in these proceedings in the Upper
    Tribunal.

Relevant Background Facts

 2. The appellant is a national of China.  Her  husband  and  sponsor,  Lam
    Auyong, was born in Vietnam, but came to the UK as a child and has long
    since acquired British nationality.  The sponsor was previously married
    to someone else, by whom he had two children.

 3. The sponsor first met the appellant in China  in  September  2003,  and
    their relationship began in 2004.  They got  married  in  China  on  20
    February 2008, and the appellant has borne two children by the sponsor.
     Yong Xi was born in China on 28 November 2005, and Yong Yi was born in
    China on 9 May 2010.  For a long period, family life was carried on  at
    a distance, with the sponsor making visits to China to see his wife and
    children from time to time.  Both the  children  of  the  marriage  are
    British citizens by descent from their father.

 4. In September 2013 the appellant and the sponsor made the decision  that
    the older child, Yong Xi, should join his father in the UK,  while  the
    younger child remained in China with his mother.

 5. On 7 November 2013 the appellant  applied  for  entry  clearance  under
    Paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM of the Rules.  On 20 February 2014  a
    decision on application was placed on hold until the outcome was  known
    of the Secretary of State's appeal in MM & Others.  On 11 July 2014 the
    Court of Appeal upheld the Secretary  of  State's  appeal,  and  on  10
    September  2014  the   Entry   Clearance   Officer   (Post   reference:
    Beijing\1492585)  gave  his  reasons  for  refusing   the   appellant's
    application.

 6. She stated that her sponsor had been employed as  a  Buyer  for  Jinkko
    Products Limited since 1 June 2012  and  earned  an  annual  income  of
    �20,000.  She had submitted a letter from her sponsor's employer  dated
    22 October 2013.  This letter did not confirm the period over which  he
    had been paid the level of salary relied upon in  the  application,  or
    the type of employment.

 7. She had not provided payslips, covering a period of six months prior to
    the date of application.  The bank statements  provided  also  did  not
    show that the sponsor's salary had been  paid  over  a  period  of  six
    months prior to the date of application.

 8. CompanyCheck.co.uk revealed  that  the  sponsor  had  ceased  to  be  a
    director of the Company. He was a director from 19 December 2012 to  20
    July 2013.

 9. The P60 in her sponsor's name for the tax year ending April 2013 stated
    that he had only earned �10,000.02.  This had been verified  by  HMRC's
    checks.

10. Therefore, she had not shown that her sponsor had an annual  income  of
    �20,000.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. Both parties were legally represented before Judge Bowler.  The sponsor
    gave oral evidence.  His older son was living with his parents  because
    he was travelling so much.  His younger son could not join him  in  the
    UK because his parents could not cope  with  looking  after  two  young
    children.  He had been going to Vietnam and China six  or  seven  times
    each year for business, although he had  reduced  that  recently.   His
    older son had gone back to China for one month in 2015, and  he  missed
    his mother dreadfully.  He had not been able to visit his wife in China
    in 2015.  Both his children spoke Mandarin and Cantonese.  His  son  in
    the UK was attending school, and he also  attended  Chinese  school  on
    Sundays.  The longest period of time that he, the sponsor, had spent in
    China was two months.

12. In his subsequent decision,  the  Judge  found  that  the  sponsor  was
    probably earning a gross income of more than �18,600 per annum when his
    wife's application was made.  However, he was  required  to  apply  the
    Rules in Appendix FM-SE.  He was unable to find that the appellant  met
    the requirements of Appendix FM-SE, and so he had to dismiss the appeal
    under the Rules.

13. The Judge went on to give extensive reasons for finding that the appeal
    should be dismissed in the alternative on  human  rights  grounds.   He
    observed that the appellant and sponsor  had  decided  to  split  their
    children between the UK and  China  in  2013.   He  had  no  reason  to
    conclude that they had  acted  other  than  in  their  children's  best
    interests.  The sponsor said that he could not move to  China  to  live
    there, because his parents, sister and cousins were in the  UK.   There
    was no evidence to show that the contact  with  those  members  of  his
    family needed to be greater  than  that  permitted  through  telephone,
    electronic communication and visits.

14. The sponsor was a British citizen, but he worked and he could take  his
    skills to China, to look for work in  China.   He  often  travelled  to
    China and did business there.  He was not persuaded  that  the  sponsor
    faced problems relocating to China to be with the appellant.  While  he
    recognised that the older child was a British citizen, and he would  be
    giving up his rights, he had been living in China until  2013  and  his
    British citizenship was not  a  trump  card.   He  found  that  it  was
    reasonable to expect the sponsor and the older child to move  to  China
    to continue family life with the appellant.

15. The Judge addressed the issue of delay.  The appellant had to wait  ten
    months for a decision on her application.  However, the  appellant  and
    her sponsor had failed to  provide  the  documentary  evidence  clearly
    required by the respondent, or an explanation as to why it could not be
    provided.  The fact that there was a delay of  nearly  three  years  in
    getting to the stage of the appeal hearing was due in no small part  to
    the appellant and her sponsor.  Accordingly, the decision take  by  the
    respondent was necessary and proportionate.

16. The Judge held that the way forward was for the  appellant  to  make  a
    fresh application, now that she was clear that the  specified  evidence
    must be provided.   To the extent that she could not  provide  it,  she
    could give an explanation and invite the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    exercise evidential discretion.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

17. On 16 March 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge Page granted  permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:
         "The grounds of appeal  argue  that  the  Judge  acknowledged  that
         refusal of entry clearance had prevented the appellant and her  two
         sons being reunited.  It argues that the Judge  had  not  explained
         how the interference is proportionate.  This is a broad  complaint.
         Given the importance of this decision  to  the  appellant  and  the
         children and the  separation  of  their  mother,  I  have  taken  a
         purposive approach  to  this  application.   Paragraph  44  of  the
         Judge's decision suggests that the Judge is  considering  remitting
         this case to the respondent  for  further  consideration.   If  the
         result under Article 8 was so clear for the Judge  to  conclude  at
         paragraph 53 of  the  decision  that  the  decision  taken  by  the
         respondent was  both  necessary  and  proportionate,  it  begs  the
         question as to why the Judge had considered remitting the matter to
         the  respondent  for  fresh   consideration.    The   sponsor   had
         demonstrated the pre-requisite income to show that he had  a  gross
         income of �20,000.04 as shown by his  P60.   At  paragraph  28  the
         Judge said on the evidence available to the  respondent  the  Entry
         Clearance Manager "there  was  no  trigger"  for  the  exercise  of
         discretion under the evidential flexibility provisions as  set  out
         in paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE.  The  Judge  has  found  that  it
         would be in the best interests of the family to avoid  any  further
         delay, [and this is] the reason why the Judge decided not to  remit
         the matter to the respondent after all.  The Judge  has  said  that
         this would enable the appellant to obtain the correct  evidence  so
         the Entry Clearance Officer could be asked to  exercise  evidential
         discretion.  The application for permission to appeal on the ground
         that the Judge has not explained how  the  interference  of  family
         life is proportionate is  capable  of  further  argument  on  these
         facts, so I grant permission to appeal  so  these  matters  can  be
         fully considered."

The Appeal Hearing

18. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, there  was  no  appearance  by  the  appellant's  nominated  legal
    representatives.  I was satisfied that adequate notice had  been  given
    to them of the time, date and place of hearing,  and  that  it  was  in
    accordance with the overriding objective to proceed with the hearing of
    the appeal in their absence.

19. Ms Ahmad submitted that the appeal should be dismissed for the  reasons
    given in the Rule 24 response settled by her colleague.

Discussion

20. There was no error in the Judge finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
    shown that she met the MIR.  As the  Judge  explained,  the  evidential
    requirements contained in Appendix FM-SE had not  been  complied  with.
    Counsel, who appeared below on behalf of the appellant,  accepted  that
    the employer's  letter  did  not  contain  the  mandatory  information.
    Although the Judge found  that  the  appellant  had  now  provided  the
    requisite run of six months' payslips, the corresponding  run  of  bank
    statements did not show the payment of employment income to the sponsor
    in the month of May  2013.   The  Judge  accepted  the  sponsor's  oral
    evidence that he had been paid in cash in May 2013 as he was travelling
    to Vietnam that month, and  so  he  had  asked  for  payment  in  cash.
    However, notwithstanding the Judge's acceptance of the  sponsor's  oral
    evidence on this issue, there had still been  non-compliance  with  the
    relevant evidential requirement set out in Appendix FM-SE.

21. There was also no error  in  the  Judge  finding  that  the  evidential
    flexibility provisions set out in paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE had not
    been triggered by way of appeal.  It was open to the Judge to make this
    finding for the reasons which he gave.  Firstly,  neither  the  sponsor
    nor his advisers had informed the respondent when appealing as  to  why
    the bank statement for May 2013 did not show  his  monthly  wage  being
    paid in by BACS. Secondly, no explanation had ever been provided as  to
    why the employer's letter was so defective.

22. With regard to the assessment of a human rights claim outside the Rule,
    the Judge acknowledged at paragraph [43] that  neither  the  respondent
    nor the Entry Clearance Manager had made any reference to the  children
    or to section 55, despite the children's details being included in  the
    appellant's application.  At paragraph [44],  the  Judge  said  he  was
    mindful of the options available to him in such a situation, as set out
    in MK (Section 55 - Tribunal options)  [2015]  UKUT  223.   These  were
    either to remit the case to the ECO for further  consideration,  or  to
    decide the Article 8 claim himself, taking into account the  children's
    best interests  as  a  primary  consideration  in  the  proportionality
    assessment. The Judge gave adequate reasons  for  choosing  the  latter
    option, rather than the former option.

23. The Judge went on to give adequate reasons as to why it was  reasonable
    to expect the sponsor and the older  child  to  relocate  to  China  to
    continue family life there with the appellant and  the  younger  child;
    or, in the alternative, for the appellant to make a  fresh  application
    for entry clearance in which she produced the specified evidence  under
    Appendix FM-SE to show that the sponsor was earning over �18,600.

24. The Judge was right not to  exercise  evidential  flexibility  himself.
    The discretion to exercise evidential  flexibility  is  vested  in  the
    primary decision-maker, not the judicial decision-maker.  Although  the
    Judge was of the view  that  the  sponsor  was  probably  earning  over
    �18,600 per annum, he had to apply the Rules.  According to the  Rules,
    the appellant had not provided the specified evidence to show that  the
    sponsor was in fact earning over �18,600 per annum.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
