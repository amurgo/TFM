                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Metzer instructed by Huneewoth solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1. The SSHD was granted permission to appeal the  decision  of  First-
         tier Tribunal  judge  Hanley  who,  for  reasons  in  his  decision
         promulgated on 8 December 2016,  allowed  the  respondents'  appeal
         under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.


      2. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Harris adjourned the hearing before him
         on 14th August 2014. The appeal came before me on 3rd January  2018
         for case management and I directed it be set down for hearing  both
         in relation to whether there was an error of law and, if there  was
         an error of law,  to  proceed  with  substantive  remaking  of  the
         decision.


      3. Before me on 21st February 2018 both parties agreed  there  was  an
         error of law in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hanley  -
         EX.1. does not apply. I set aside the decision to be remade.


      4. Mr Tufan provided the Tribunal and Mr  Metzer  with  a  copy  of  a
         letter dated 19th  February  2018  sending  [NN]'s  certificate  of
         registration as a British Citizen.


      5. Mr Tufan also brought to  my  attention  Home  Office  Guidance  on
         Appendix FM and SF and others (Guidance,  post  2014  Act)  Albania
         [2017] UKUT 120 (IAC).


      6. Taking these matters  into  consideration  I  remake  the  decision
         regarding Alvina [N] and [AN] and allow their appeals  against  the
         decision of the SSHD to refuse their human rights claim.  There  is
         no longer jurisdiction to hear the appeal of  [NN]  because,  as  a
         British Citizen, she cannot be removed from the UK but if and in so
         far as her appeal remains outstanding, her appeal is also allowed.


      7. Mr Metzer initially sought an order for costs and then amended this
         to  state  he  would  seek  instructions  on  whether  to  make  an
         application for costs.


      8. I directed that if Ms [N] and her two  children  wish  to  make  an
         application for costs, such application is to be made  in  writing,
         copied to  Senior  Presenting  Officer  Peter  Deller,  by  4pm  on
         Wednesday 28th February 2018. I shall thereafter  review  the  file
         and decide what further directions, if any, are required.


    Conclusions:


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.


    I set aside the decision  and  remake  the  decision  by  allowing  the
    appeals of Ms Alvina Naidoo and her two children against the SSHD.


    Consequential Directions


    If Ms [N] and her two children wish to make an application  for  costs,
    such application is to be made in writing, copied to Senior  Presenting
    Officer Peter Deller, by 4pm on Wednesday 28th February 2018.  I  shall
    thereafter review the file and decide what further directions, if  any,
    are required.
