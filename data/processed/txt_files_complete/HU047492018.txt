For the Appellants:          Mr N. Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Jacques M Rene of Counsel, instructed by direct
access


                            DECISION and REASONS

 1. The Respondent Mr Parekh is a British Overseas Citizen  born  in  1970.
    He was formerly resident in India but has lived in the  United  Kingdom
    since 2007. In February 2017 he made an application for leave to remain
    on human rights grounds. That  application  was  refused,  but  by  its
    decision of the 31st October 2018 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Asjad)
    allowed Mr Parekh's appeal against  that  decision.  The  Secretary  of
    State now has permission to appeal against the First-tier Tribunal.




 2. Before the First-tier Tribunal  Mr  Parekh  relied  on  Article  8.  He
    submitted that he could  demonstrate  there  to  be  'very  significant
    obstacles' to his integration in India such that  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) were met, and further that 'outwith the  Rules'
    the Secretary of State could not  show  the  refusal  of  leave  to  be
    proportionate.


 3. The relevant facts, for the purpose of the appeal before the First-tier
    Tribunal, were found to be as follows:

              i) Mr Parekh was born in 1970 and spent  his  entire  life  in
                 India up until the point that he left in 2007;


             ii) He worked in India and speaks fluent Gujerati;

            iii) His wife and children remain in India;


             iv) His elderly mother lives in the United Kingdom and had done
                 for some ten years at the date of decision;

              v) Although he does provide her with some care she is not,  as
                 he claimed, dependent upon her;


             vi) On the 29th August 2007 Mr Parekh  surrendered  his  Indian
                 passport,  having  been  issued  with  a  British  Overseas
                 citizen  passport.  The   Indian   authorities   thereafter
                 required him to register  as  a  foreigner.   The  Tribunal
                 therefore accepted that he has lost his Indian nationality.




 4. Applying those facts to the legal  framework  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed the appeal 'under  the  Rules'.   It  found  that  Mr  Parekh
    clearly retains family and social links with India such that  it  could
    not be said that he faces very  significant  obstacles.   There  is  no
    appeal against that decision.


 5. In respect of Article 8 the Tribunal said this:

         "I do not find that the care that he provides to his mother amounts
         to a compassionate circumstance for  the  reasons  I  have  already
         given.  It was his choice to move to the UK in 2008 and not return,
         and I find that his primary  reason  for  doing  so  was  for  work
         purposes.  It is clear  from  the  Appellant's  statement  when  he
         mentions that his wife has accepted the circumstances  because  men
         do go abroad to work - that that was his motive for staying in  the
         UK.  He has no right to work and yet even as the date of hearing  -
         he continues to do so.  Although the Appellant claims  that  he  is
         proud of his British heritage, there is little or  no  evidence  of
         integration.  He speaks minimal English and required an interpreter
         at court.  I accept that there is some evidence of him having  done
         an English course but it is still cost  to  the  taxpayer  that  he
         required an interpreter.  He had paid tax, but he had been  working
         in breach of the terms of his status  and  has  therefore  shown  a
         disregard for immigration  laws  in  that  regard.   All  of  these
         factors are relevant to the proportionality  assessment  as  is  my
         finding that he has lost his Indian  nationality.   On  balance,  I
         find that the latter is a factor that should be  given  significant
         weight and that in the balancing exercise the interference with his
         private life is disproportionate.  I  therefore  allow  the  appeal
         under article 8 outside of the rules"


 6. The Secretary of State now appeals that decision.  Although the grounds
    of appeal stretch to 12 paragraphs, in  reality  they  make  two  short
    points.  First, that the decision fails to reflect the public  interest
    as it is expressed in s117B of Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002.  Second, that the decision is vitiated for a lack of reasoning.


 7. Following an initial hearing on the 8th March 2019 I issued  a  written
    decision indicating that I found both grounds are made out. My  reasons
    are set out below. The hearing was reconvened on the 7th May 2019, when
    I heard no further evidence, but detailed submissions from the parties.
    I now give my decision in the appeal.



    Error of Law

 8. The paragraph cited above, although it makes reference to  Mr  Parekh's
    inability to speak English, contains no analysis of what weight  should
    be attached to his private life. As the grounds point out, section 117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  mandates  that
    decision-makers apply the stipulated public interest considerations  in
    all cases:

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
         cases


         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public
         interest.


         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the
         economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English,
         because persons who can speak English-


           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the
         economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
         because such persons-


           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


         (4) Little weight should be given to-


           (a) a private life, or
           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United
         Kingdom unlawfully.


         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at
         a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.


         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public
         interest does not require the person's removal where-


           (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship
           with a qualifying child, and
           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
           United Kingdom.


 9. It is not  in  issue  that  Mr  Parekh's  status  in  this  country  is
    "precarious". His repeated attempts to register as  a  British  citizen
    were refused by the Home Office and by his order of 18th September 2013
    Mr Justice Collins refused him permission to judicially review the last
    of those decisions, finding that the Secretary of State was entitled to
    issue the refusal under section 4B(2)(b) of the British Nationality Act
    1981.   Whilst the parties were in agreement that Mr  Parekh  may  have
    entered the United Kingdom as a visitor in 2007 it does not appear that
    he  has  any  leave  since.   This  was  clearly  a  factor   of   some
    significance, since it meant, by  virtue  of  s117B  (5)  that  only  a
    "little weight" could be attached to the life that he  has  established
    here.


10. In respect of the second  ground  I  am  mindful  that  decision-makers
    cannot be expected to give detailed reasons for each and every  finding
    that they make. In any reasons-based challenge the test must be whether
    the party who has lost is able to understand why they  have  lost.   In
    this instance I have no idea why  the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  the
    decision to refuse leave to  be  disproportionate,  so  I  can  readily
    accept that the Secretary of State is equally in the dark.   All of the
    reasons to refuse leave are, on the analysis set out at  my  �5  above,
    all outweighed  by  the  fact  that  Mr  Parekh  has  lost  his  Indian
    nationality. No explanation  is  offered  as  to  why  that  matter  is
    relevant to the question of whether this  decision  is  unlawful  under
    s6(1) of the Human Rights  Act  1998.  The  determination  contains  no
    analysis or findings on what the impact might be on Mr Parekh of such a
    loss of citizenship. There are for instance no findings on whether  the
    Indian government would readmit him to its territory, or allow  him  to
    live there unhindered; there is no consideration of the  evidence  that
    Mr Parekh was previously registered as a foreigner living in  India  or
    the possibility that that exercise could be repeated.




    The Submissions


11. Mr Rene began his submissions by giving me  further  background  on  Mr
    Parekh's life so far. He is a BOC because  his  parents  were  born  in
    Kenya, under British rule. He himself was born in India, and from there
    he spent  many  years  trying  to  get  recognition  from  the  British
    authorities. He was issued with an  Indian  passport  in  2001  but  by
    Indian law  was  required  to  surrender  that  passport  when  he  was
    eventually recognised as a BOC, because India does not  recognise  dual
    nationality.


12. He arrived in the United Kingdom in 2007. He  was  never  advised  that
    there were any conditions attached to his entry, specifically  that  he
    was not permitted to take employment. He was  issued  with  a  National
    Insurance number and has never had any problem working.   It  was  only
    when he decided that he would try and bring his wife and children  here
    to join him that he was advised that he would need to apply to  convert
    his 'British Overseas Citizen' status to become  a  'British  citizen'.
    That is where his  problems  started,  and  how  he  ended  up  in  the
    Tribunal.

13. Mr Parekh has  attempted  to  clarify  his  position  with  the  Indian
    authorities on a number of occasions. On the 20th May 2009 he wrote  to
    the Ministry of External Affairs Regional Passport Office in  Ahmedabad
    asking them to confirm that he would never have  been  issued  with  an
    Indian passport had they known that he was in fact a BOC.  On  the  4th
    July 2013 his then solicitors  wrote  to  the  Indian  High  Commission
    asking  them  to  confirm  whether  he  was  able  to   regain   Indian
    citizenship. They wrote in the same terms a week  later  to  the  Joint
    Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs in  New  Delhi.  None  of
    these letters elicited a response. Mr Parekh further describes  in  his
    witness statement how he approached the  consulate  in  Birmingham  who
    said that they could not assist and that he had to go to London.

14. Against that background Mr Rene took  me  to  the  Home  Office  policy
    statement  issued  in  November  2004:  the  Immigration  Directorates'
    Instructions Chapter 22, Section 2 'British Passports'. At paragraph  9
    that instructions reads:

         "In some cases a BOC will claim that his nationality obliges the UK
         to allow him to remain. In considering such cases we must be aware
         that no country routinely accepts non-citizens and that we cannot
         force a BOC to go somewhere else. There is a balance between those
         who genuinely find themselves with nowhere to go and those seeking
         to circumvent the immigration rules.
         UKPH [United Kingdom passport holders] applicants who make an
         application for exceptional LTR/ILR and have no claim to remain
         under the Rules are to be refused unless there are compelling
         compassionate circumstances present or there is clear evidence of
         non-returnability"


15. Notwithstanding that this guidance shows its age, with its reference to
    'exceptional leave to remain', the parties confirmed that it remains in
    force and that it should now be read to be referring to  'Discretionary
    Leave'. Likewise the test of "compelling  compassionate  circumstances"
    could be transposed into the language of human rights law and  read  as
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences", or a disproportionate  interference
    with family and/or private life.  Mr Rene submitted that both limbs  of
    the test set out in the policy were here satisfied.


16. First, he submitted, there would be  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
    for Mr Parekh if he were to be returned to India. He did have a  permit
    to remain in India as a 'foreign national' between the 27th August 2007
    and the 15th September 2007 but this placed severe restrictions on him.
    It states on its face that a failure to obtain  further  permission  to
    remain would render him liable to prosecution for contravention of  the
    Provisions of the Foreigners Act 1946, punishable with imprisonment for
    a period of five years, a fine and/or  expulsion  from  India.    As  a
    registered foreigner he is obliged to report to his local  Registration
    Officer if he wishes to leave his registered address for more than  two
    weeks, providing a full itinerary of the places he intends to visit. If
    he moves house, or stays in one other place for more than  seven  days,
    he must tell the Registration Officer.   Failure to do so would  render
    him liable to prosecution.

17. As to the second limb of the test in the policy, Mr Rene points to  the
    various  failed  attempts  to  get  clarification   from   the   Indian
    authorities as evidence of his non-returnability. He accepts  that  the
    burden of proof is on Mr Parekh,  but  submits  that  on  the  evidence
    provided, that burden has been discharged.

18. Mr Bramble reminded me that this is a human rights appeal, which I  can
    only allow if I am satisfied that the decision to refuse leave would be
    a disproportionate interference with  Mr  Parekh's  private  life.  The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make a finding that he  shared  a  Kugathas
    family life with his mother and there was nothing to indicate that this
    was the case. Applying the  public  interest  considerations  in  s117B
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  it  was  clear  that  the
    public interest prevailed.  The tests in the  IDI  did  not  assist  Mr
    Parekh since he had not shown that there were compelling  compassionate
    circumstances, or that there was clear evidence of non-returnability.




    The Re-Made Decision

19. Mr Parekh brings  this  appeal  under  s82(1)(b)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:


         82 Right of appeal to the Tribunal

         (1) A person ("P") may appeal to the Tribunal where-

         (a) the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a protection claim
         made by P,

         (b) the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human rights
         claim made by P, or

         (c) the Secretary of State has decided to revoke P's protection
         status.



20. His ground of appeal is set out in s84(2):

         (2) An appeal under  section  82(1)(b)  (refusal  of  human  rights
         claim) must be brought on the ground that the decision is  unlawful
         under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.



21. Section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 reads:



         Acts of public authorities.

         1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is
            incompatible with a Convention right.



22. The Convention right relied upon here is Article 8 ECHR.  In  any  case
    where I must consider Article 8 rights I am obliged to have  regard  to
    the public  interest  considerations  set  out  in  s117B  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (set out at my �8 above).


23. I accept and find as fact that Mr Parekh has  a  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom. He has lived here for approximately 12  years  now.  He
    has worked, paid tax, made friends and a life for himself. He is  close
    to, and spends a lot of time with his mother, who is  now  elderly  and
    looks to him for  comfort  and  support.    I  am  satisfied  that  the
    decision to refuse leave would amount  to  an  interference  with  that
    private life and so Article 8 is engaged.


24. There does not appear to be any dispute that the Secretary of State was
    entitled, as a matter of law, to take the decision  that  he  has.  The
    question is whether the decision is disproportionate.

25. Mr Rene framed his submissions  on  proportionality  in  terms  of  the
    Secretary of State's policy: he should succeed if he  can  show  either
    that there is clear evidence of his non-returnability to India, or that
    there are compelling compassionate circumstances.  If either or both of
    these two limbs were met, the decision to refuse leave would have to be
    found disproportionate.

26. The Appellant acknowledges  that  he  bears  the  burden  of  proof  in
    establishing that he is unable to return to India, and that he standard
    is a balance of probabilities.  In seeking to discharge that burden  he
    points to the efforts he has made thus far in  trying  to  contact  the
    Indian authorities. I accept that the Appellant, or someone  acting  on
    his behalf, has written to the Ministry of  External  Affairs  Regional
    Passport Office in Ahmedabad (in May 2009), the Indian High  Commission
    in London and the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of  External  Affairs
    in New Delhi (both July 2013). I  further  accept  that  the  Appellant
    visited the consulate in Birmingham on a date unknown.

27. I am not satisfied that any of these approaches demonstrates  a  "clear
    evidence of non-returnability". First, because the  letters  themselves
    are not concerned with whether the Appellant is able to return to India
    and continue to live there with his wife and children. In each  of  the
    letters I have been shown the Appellant has enquired about citizenship;
    why is difficult to fathom given that he must have known the answer. As
    long as he is a BOC he is no longer entitled, as  a  matter  of  Indian
    law, to re-acquire that  nationality.    Second,  because  the  letters
    themselves, whilst I do not doubt that they were sent, tell me  nothing
    about the view of the Indian authorities. The most straightforward  way
    for the Appellant to demonstrate his non-returnability to  India  would
    be to apply for a visa to re-enter the country. This he has  not  done.
    Third, because other evidence in  fact  indicates  that  the  Appellant
    would be permitted to enter and remain in  India:  as  he  has  himself
    acknowledged, he was permitted to remain there as a 'foreigner' in  the
    period immediately after his recognition as a BOC. Mr Rene  was  unable
    to tell me why that period was so short, but on at least one reading of
    the evidence it was simply because the 15th September  2007  (the  date
    that his 'foreign national' permit expired) was the date  that  he  was
    due to travel to the United  Kingdom.   As  the  evidence  stands,  the
    Appellant has not demonstrated that he is unable to return to India.


28. Mr Rene submits that notwithstanding  my  conclusion  on  returnability
    there are here compelling compassionate circumstances.  In  the  United
    Kingdom the Appellant lives with, and gives meaningful support to,  his
    aging mother. Mr Rene submits that in India  he  would  be  subject  to
    significant restrictions on his ability to live freely, for instance to
    choose his place of residence. As the permit  issued  to  him  in  2007
    demonstrates, he would not be  treated  like  an  Indian  national.  He
    would, for instance, have to register his place of residence  with  the
    authorities and tell them if he moved.

29. I have given some significant weight to the fact that the Appellant  is
    a British Overseas Citizen, and that he gave up his Indian  nationality
    in the genuinely held belief that this status would entitle him to come
    and live and work in the United Kingdom. I  accept  his  evidence  that
    when he entered the country in 2007 he was permitted to do  so  without
    condition, and that his national insurance number  was  issued  to  him
    upon production of his BOC passport. The Appellant's  belief  may  have
    been mistaken, but it was honestly held. I accept that  he  fought  all
    those years to get his BOC  status  recognised,  and  left  his  family
    behind, because he believed that he was entitled to enter this  country
    and make a better life for himself, his wife and his  children.    That
    those hopes have been dashed is no doubt a  bitter  disappointment  for
    him, and I accept that it may be hard to bear.

30. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant has, in  the  years
    that he has spent in the United Kingdom, contributed  to  his  mother's
    care, keeping her company and generally looking  after  her  wellbeing.
    Whilst it rejected the suggestion that he was her carer,  or  that  she
    needed him to look after her, the substance  of  the  relationship  was
    recognised. I have attached some weight to that,  and  I  have  further
    taken into account the fact that his return to India would be difficult
    and upsetting for her, given that she has become used to his presence.

31. I am able to attach only a little weight to the restrictions that might
    be placed on the Appellant as a foreigner in India. The only evidence I
    have on this point is the  2007  permit.  I  do  not  know  whether  in
    practice any of  the  penalties  set  out  therein  are  ever  actually
    imposed, or in what circumstances. Moreover I  do  not  accept  that  a
    restriction such as having to keep the authorities informed as to  your
    place of residence is a matter that  can  be  said  to  impinge  on  an
    individual's private  life  in  any  meaningful  way.  It  is  a  basic
    administrative requirement that any state might impose on non-nationals
    resident there. The Home Office routinely expects  foreigners  residing
    here to keep them informed of their address; that cannot rationally  be
    framed as a disproportionate interference with their liberty or privacy
    within the meaning of Article 8(2).  There is no  evidence  to  suggest
    that  a  Registration  Officer,  duly  informed  of   the   Appellant's
    intentions or address, would deny him the right to reside or visit  any
    particular place.

32. Against these factors is the fact that the Appellant would be returning
    to live in India, where he has lived for most of his life, and where he
    would be reunited with his wife and children, a wholly positive outcome
    as far as  Article  8  is  concerned.   The  Appellant's  loss  of  his
    relationship with his mother, and friends that he might  have  made  in
    this country, must be balanced against that.

33.  Having considered all of those facts I conclude that the Secretary  of
    State has discharged the burden upon him and shown this decision to  be
    a necessary and proportionate response  to  the  need  to  protect  the
    economy.  The consequence for the Appellant is that he will be able  to
    return to India to live with his family.  That could not, absent  other
    compelling circumstances, amount to an outcome that could  be  said  to
    unjustifiably harsh.

34. I record for the sake of  completeness  that  the  Appellant  has  not,
    before me, put his case on the basis that he is stateless.
