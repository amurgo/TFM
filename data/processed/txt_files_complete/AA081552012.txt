               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent
For the Appellant:           Mr Talacchi
For the Respondent:    Ms Rackstraw (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                                  Decision



   1. The appellant's claim is set out at paragraphs 12 to 29 of  the  First
      Tier Tribunal Determination. In short the first  appellant  claims  to
      have had a warrant issued for his arrest for LTTE activities and fears
      persecution for that reason. The First Tier Tribunal considered appeal
      claim but rejected it. This matter appeared before  me  following  the
      decision of Upper Tribunal  Judge Dawson  and  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
      Judge Davey who decided on 3rd May 2013 as follows:



      "1.   The Appellants,  nationals  of  [Sri  Lanka],  appealed  against
      decisions made by the Respondent to  make  removal  directions  on  21
      August 2012. The decisions were in identical terms.

      2.    The Appellants' appeals came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Duff who on  16  October  2012  dismissed  their  appeals  on  asylum,
      humanitarian protection and human rights grounds. Permission to appeal
      that decision was given by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kamara  on  8
      November 2012.


      3.    The first ground of challenge related  to  the  claim  that  the
      judge had failed to consider the evidence provided in letter dated  20
      September 2012 by Mr Abdul Marsook, an attorney-at-law, who claimed to
      be the family lawyer, who had acted for the first Appellant.

      4.    The second ground related to the claim that the judge had failed
      to consider explanations made for the first Appellant's return to  Sri
      Lanka on a number of occasions at a time when, on one  account,  there
      was risk for the first Appellant.


      5.       The  third  ground  was  that  in  the  assessment   of   the
      documentation and in  particular  the  consideration  of  a  newspaper
      article, presented as an extract from the Malai Megam  of  14  January
      2012, relating to an attack on 26 December 2011. It was said that  had
      a police report and a genuine death certificate of the victim  of  the
      attack described in the article, been taken into account  a  different
      view might have been taken of the claim.


      6.      The fourth ground, although not particularly pursued,  related
      to the first Appellant's delay in claiming asylum  and  a  failure  to
      consider the explanation for delay put forward by the first Appellant.


      7.    Having considered the submissions made by the parties  we  found
      that it was clear that although there  is  passing  reference  to  the
      evidence of Mr Marsook, there was  no  sufficient  reasoning,  in  the
      sense contemplated by R (Iran) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982 to show  why
      that letter was not given  particular  weight  in  the  light  of  the
      submissions made. Accordingly we found that there was substance in the
      letter that  needed  to  be  addressed  and  dealt  with  adequate  or
      sufficient reasons.


      8.     As to the second ground, we found that the judge had  addressed
      the Appellant's claims in relation to his return to Sri Lanka  and  we
      did not see that there was  any  inadequate  reasoning  in  addressing
      those matters. Accordingly we did not find the second ground disclosed
      any error of law.


      9.    In relation to the third ground, Mr Khan correctly accepted that
      the form and layout and content of the newspaper article  relied  upon
      were subject to sustainable criticism by the  judge;  particularly  at
      paragraph 45 of the determination. We did however not  agree,  as  was
      suggested, that the death certificate and the police  report  rendered
      the newspaper article the more reliable  or  that  together  with  the
      article would have drawn a different conclusion.


      10.   We noted that an  Appellant,  as  much  as  the  Respondent,  is
      entitled to proper and adequate reasons. We found that there were  not
      the clear findings essentially for a proper  assessment  of  the  risk
      factors as demanded by the cases of LP(LTTE area-Tamils-Colombo-risk?)
      [2007] UKAIT 76 and TK( Tamils- LP updated) [2009] UKAIT00049.

      11.   Further we noted that the findings simply  did  not  clearly  or
      sufficiently identify what view had been taken of  the  evidence.  For
      example, at paragraph 44 of the determination, the judge said:


            "I find that the  documentation  in  this  case  carries  little
      weight and,      to some extent, positively undermines the Appellants'
      claims."

      12.   It therefore is by no means clear what weight was actually given
      to which pieces of the documentation and to what extent the claim  was
      undermined  other  than   to   some   unspecified   degree.   In   the
      circumstances, we find that it is necessary  for  the  matter  of  the
      evidence of Mr Marsook to be properly addressed in the context of  the
      evidence as a whole.


      13.   We conclude that the original Tribunal's  decision  discloses  a
      material error of law and cannot stand. The decision will have  to  be
      remade. We do  not  think  it  was  necessary  in  the  light  of  the
      President's guidance for the case  to  be  remade  in  the  First-tier
      Tribunal."


   2. They went on to make the following direction:

      "List for hearing 1ï¿½  hours to  address  the  specific  issue  of  the
      evidence of Mr Masook, particularly how and when it was  acquired.  It
      will be a matter for the Appellant whether that evidence  is  obtained
      in a statement signed by Mr Marsook."


   3. The hearing before me proceeded on the basis that the case now  turned
      upon the reliability of an arrest warrant as vouched for by the letter
      from Mr Marsook, if reliable it disclosed a risk to the  appellant  if
      not reliable it could not alter the  conclusions  of  the  First  Tier
      Tribunal, since that is the effect  of  the  decision  and  directions
      above.       .


   4. This matter had previously been listed before me  on  15th  June  2013
      when discussions took place about the effect  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
      decision to rehear the evidence relating to the  lawyers,  no  hearing
      was possible because of the absence of an interpreter. As part of that
      discussion it was made plain to the Home Office that  the  appellant's
      case was now inextricably linked to the reliability  of  the  lawyer's
      letter, and they should institute what enquiries they thought  fit  to
      deal with that point. Written directions were prepared  on  25th  July
      2013 and although Ms Rackstraw indicated that they had not reached the
      Home Office she acknowledged that the Home  Office  had  conducted  as
      many enquiries as they wished into the veracity of the  documents  and
      background of the lawyers concerned.


   5. The appellant gave evidence about the arrest warrant and its veracity
      indicating that he was told just to  answer  the  questions  asked  in
      interview with the Home Office and as he understood matters the lawyer
      had been allowed to take a copy of the warrant and it had been sent to
      him because he had  asked  his  father  to  seek  proof.  Under  cross
      examination the appellant remained adamant as to the veracity  of  the
      attested  warrant,  he  also  produced  a  letter  from  the   lawyers
      indicating that they had indeed copied a genuine warrant and  sent  it
      to him. He explained that he had not specifically mentioned a  warrant
      at the end of the interview because  he  was  unsure  which  documents
      would be supplied, but when they had arrived he had passed it  to  the
      Home Office.


   6. Ms Rackstraw had a number of criticisms of the  appellant's  evidence,
      in particular that he should have mentioned the warrant in  interview,
      that the appellant refers to  being  detained  for  2  weeks  and  his
      lawyers mention several days. The appellant explains that he was  told
      only to answer questions as asked in  interview  and  when  given  the
      opportunity to comment at the end  did  mention  producing  documents,
      although at that stage he did not know the warrant  would  be  one  of
      them. I accept that the explanation for failure to mention the warrant
      is  a  reasonable  one,  as  is  his  explanation  for  the   apparent
      discrepancy between several days and a fortnight, which is that in Sri
      Lanka the word fortnight  does  not  have  a  direct  equivalent,  and
      several days is a reasonable translation of the period. As regards the
      document it is suggested a lawyer would not use the term "To  whom  it
      may concern", I am not persuaded by that argument, it is  not  at  all
      clear whether a Sri Lankan lawyer might use that phrase or not.


   7. The Secretary of State has had  an  opportunity  to  check  whether  a
      lawyer of the name indicated is in practice and accepts that they  are
      and that the details such as address on the verification documents are
      correct, nonetheless I am urged to find that the documents relating to
      the warrant are unreliable looking at the evidence overall.  It  seems
      to  me  that  the  documents  relating  to  the  warrant  are  broadly
      consistent, that the explanation given by the appellant is  plausible,
      such checks as have been made indicate that such a lawyer exists,  and
      there is nothing on the face of the warrant  or  supporting  documents
      which indicates they are unreliable. Whilst other  criticisms  can  be
      made of the appellant's  case  and  indeed  were  by  the  First  Tier
      Tribunal considering the low standard of proof it appears to me on the
      evidence I have that there is a reasonable possibility that a  warrant
      may exist in the form claimed and in those circumstances there  is  no
      doubt that if it does exist that the appellant and his family would be
      at risk on return.
