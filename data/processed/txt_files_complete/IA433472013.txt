                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall, promulgated  on  10  March  2014,  in
    which he dismissed the appellant's appeal against  a  decision  by  the
    Secretary of State to refuse his application for a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the United Kingdom as  the  spouse
    of an EEA national said to be exercising treaty rights here.

 2. The appellant's case is that he is married to  an  EEA  national  ("the
    sponsor") who it is said runs her own business. As evidence of that  he
    provided to  the  Secretary  of  State  income  tax  returns,  national
    insurance contribution demands and bank statements.

 3. In her refusal letter of  14  October  2013,  the  Secretary  of  State
    concluded that the evidence was not sufficient  as  the  appellant  had
    failed to submit evidence of work carried out,  such  as  invoices  and
    statements, audited accounts, business bank statements showing payments
    received or  promotional  material  that  the  EEA  family  member  had
    produced in order to generate work.

 4. An appeal was lodged against that decision and the appellant  requested
    that the matter be dealt with on the papers without  an  oral  hearing.
    The matter then came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall,  who  had
    before him, in addition to the material supplied to the  respondent,  a
    bundle of material running to some 44 pages.  This again contained  tax
    calculations, self-assessment statements and bank statements.  It  also
    contained two witness statements from the appellant and his wife  which
    set out that they are lawfully married and that the  wife  works  as  a
    self-employed party planner.

 5. Judge Mayall noted that the burden was on the appellant to show that he
    met the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations").  He notes also [9]  that  the
    refusal letter had indicated to the appellant and sponsor that they had
    failed to submit evidence of work being carried out and this was  still
    the case.  He accepted that a self-assessment return has been  produced
    but considered that is not in itself evidence of work being done,  this
    being especially so with the effect of the submission results in such a
    small amount of tax payable.  In this case it was under �100.  He said:-



         "I find it extremely difficult to believe  that  there  can  be  no
         other evidence of this events planning  business.   The  appellants
         were on notice of  the  need  to  produce  some  evidence  of  work
         actually being done.  They have not done so".

    On that basis he was not satisfied the sponsor  was  exercising  treaty
    rights, and thus did not meet the requirements of the EEA Regulations.

 6. The judge then also went on to consider Article 8 and concluded that it
    would not be a disproportionate interference in his  rights  to  remove
    him from the United Kingdom.

 7. The appellant then sought permission to appeal on the grounds that:

          i) the judge was not entitled  on  the  basis  of  the  documents
             supplied  to  him  to  conclude  that  the  sponsor  was   not
             exercising treaty rights;

         ii) that the judge had failed to  take  into  account  a  book  of
             invoices submitted with the notice of appeal;

        iii) the judge's reasoning that the amount of  money  paid  in  tax
             indicated minimal economic activity was not a relevant  matter
             to be taken into  account  as  the  EEA  regulations  did  not
             provide for any specific level of income.

    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge P J White
on 14 April.

 8. When the matter came before us there was no appearance for  or  on  the
    behalf of the appellant.

 9. On consideration of the court file it appears that in both  the  notice
    of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and the notice seeking  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the appellant gave his address as care
    of OA Solicitors,  303  Hoxton  Street,  London,  N1.   No  alternative
    address  has  been  given.   It  is  unclear  to  us  why   no   proper
    correspondence address for the appellant was given.  In any event, in a
    letter dated 29 May 2014 OA Solicitors wrote to  the  Tribunal  stating
    that they have no further instructions from the appellant, have  ceased
    to represent him, and will not accept  any  further  correspondence  to
    him, but no alternative address for the appellant was.

10. We consider that  in  the  circumstances  it  was  incumbent  upon  the
    appellant, who has at this point instructed solicitors  to  pursue  the
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, to keep in contact with the Tribunal.

11. We remind ourselves of rule 2 (4)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules requires the parties to co-operate with the Tribunal in
    furthering the overriding objective which is to enable the Tribunal  to
    deal with cases fairly and justly which includes, we consider, avoiding
    delay.  We consider that in the circumstances the appellant should have
    informed the Tribunal  of  a  proper  address  at  which  he  could  be
    contacted.  We are satisfied also  that  in  the  circumstances  proper
    service of the notice of hearing has been given pursuant to Rule 12.

12. Turning to the decision of  Judge  Mayall  we  consider  that  he  give
    adequate reasons for concluding that the appellant had not  shown  that
    the sponsor was self-employed. In reality, the challenge to the Judge's
    decision is about the weight to be attached to evidence,  which  was  a
    matter for him.  It was open to him  to  conclude  that  a  tax  return
    which, as in this case, shows only that roughly �89 was payable in  the
    most recent tax year and a slightly lesser amount in the tax  year  was
    not evidence of sufficient weight to demonstrate that the  sponsor  was
    self-employed, particularly when attention had already  been  drawn  to
    the insufficiency of the evidence that the sponsor is in business.  Had
    there been, for example, a tax return showing a tax  liability  of  the
    order of �10,000 or �20,000 it would  be  different;  payment  of  that
    amount of tax is strong evidence of significant income.

13. It was open to the judge  to  find  that  it  was  somewhat  less  than
    credible for there to be no evidence whatsoever  relating  to  a  party
    planning business. As Ms Isherwood submitted and as  the  judge  noted,
    the appellant had been put on notice of additional material  which  was
    required.  They chose not to do so and there is no evidence  before  us
    that any booklet of invoices were submitted.  There  certainly  appears
    to be no covering letter to that effect, but there is one in respect of
    the other bundle.

14. The Judge's decision was one open to him on the  material  before  him,
    and accordingly we are not satisfied that the determination  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Mayall involved the making of an error of law  with
    respect to his conclusions that the appellant had not  shown  that  the
    sponsor self employed and thus a qualified person for the  purposes  of
    the EEA regulations; and, that the appellant  was  not  entitled  to  a
    residence card as confirmation of his right of residence.

15. Turning briefly to the challenge to the Article 8 finding, we  consider
    that the grounds of challenge to that failed properly  to  engage  with
    the circumstances of this case or the judge's findings.  We  note  that
    at paragraph 2.2 of the grounds reference was made to Kugathas which is
    of questionable relevance in the facts of this case, given  that  there
    appears to be no doubt whatsoever in anyone's  mind  that  family  life
    exists, on the facts of this case, between the appellant and his  wife.



16. The grounds set out at paragraph 2.3 made little sense  whatsoever  and
    consist in the greater part of a quotation from the well-known case  of
    Ridge v Baldwin [1964] and references  to  the  principles  of  natural
    justice.  Quite why this is relevant in a  case  where  the  judge  has
    clearly looked at the  evidence  as  shown  by  his  determination,  is
    unclear.

17. We consider that the grounds of appeal challenging  Article  8  of  the
    decision fail to identify any error of law on the part  of  the  judge.
    We are satisfied that he gave adequate and sufficient reasons  for  his
    conclusion that he would not be  in  breach  of  the  United  Kingdom's
    obligations pursuant to Article 8 to  remove  the  appellant  from  the
    United Kingdom.

18. For these reasons therefore  we  are  satisfied  that  the  appellant's
    appeal against the Secretary of State's decision must be dismissed  and
    we uphold the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall.


Signed                                  Date


Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul
