                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Claimant is a national of the Philippines born on 3 September 1981.
     She arrived in the United Kingdom in possession of a student visa on 5
    November 2008 and her leave was subsequently  extended  on  this  basis
    until 27 July 2012.  The Claimant then overstayed and on 25  July  2017
    she applied for further leave to remain on the basis of her marriage to
    a British citizen.  This application was refused and certified and  the
    Claimant was detained pending removal on 13 March 2018.   This  removal
    was subsequently deferred and the Claimant made an asylum  claim  which
    was based on a fear of return to her home province of Tabuk Kalinga due
    to a tribal war taking place there.  This application  was  refused  on
    the decision dated 16 April 2018 and the Claimant appealed against this
    decision to the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet for  hearing  on
    30 May 2018 where he heard evidence from the Appellant and her  husband
    D M. In a decision and reasons promulgated on 14 June 2018,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal.  Whilst rejecting the credibility of the Claimant's
    asylum claim, the judge found it would be  disproportionate  to  expect
    the Claimant to return to the Philippines and her appeal under  Article
    8 should be allowed.

 3. Permission to appeal was sought, in time, by the Secretary of State  on
    the basis that there were  a  number  of  inconsistencies  between  the
    evidence of the Claimant and her husband.  The judge failed to  make  a
    finding on whether or not  the  relationship  between  the  couple  was
    subsisting which was a material error and if the judge  did  implicitly
    accept the relationship his reasons for so doing  were  inadequate  and
    arguably inconsistent given the judge's own conflicting  findings,  the
    conflicting evidence  of  the  witnesses  and  the  absence  of  strong
    evidence submitted on the Claimant's behalf.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  P
    J M Hollingworth in a decision dated 10 August  2018  on  a  number  of
    bases, but essentially, that it was arguable that the judge  had  erred
    in attaching insufficient  weight  to  his  negative  findings  in  the
    context of the relationship and marriage and attached too  much  weight
    to the factors linked with  ostensible  evidence  of  cohabitation  and
    reached  an  arguably  unsustainable  conclusion  in   light   of   the
    discrepancies in the evidence and the stated concern of the judge as to
    the genuineness of the relationship.

     Hearing

 5. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted
    that the judge had found the Claimant to be lacking in  credibility  at
    [35] and had found there were issues with regard  to  the  relationship
    between the Claimant and her husband.  The judge apparently  felt  that
    the sole issue of cohabitation was sufficient to  establish  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship.  However if, despite his adverse findings,
    the judge was going to find in favour of the relationship there was  an
    inadequate engagement with the evidence, apart from the fact  that  the
    two people lived in the same property. She submitted that this was  not
    enough to show a subsisting and genuine relationship,  that  the  judge
    had given inadequate reasons, particularly in light of the  significant
    credibility findings.  Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that this impinges
    on the Article 8 assessment and any findings which flow  from  a  well-
    reasoned positive finding impact on the end result.  She submitted that
    the proportionality assessment was undermined as it  was  unclear  upon
    what basis it had been made.

 6. In her submissions, Ms Iengar accepted it was a brief decision but that
    she would argue that it is sustainable.   She  submitted  that  if  the
    decision was adequately reasoned then  the  proportionality  assessment
    must stand.  She submitted the grounds of appeal  were  a  disagreement
    with the judge's assessment  of  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
    evidence which  was  a  matter  for  the  judge.   In  respect  of  the
    Claimant's credibility, Ms Iengar submitted that there is a clear  line
    drawn between [34], i.e. credibility in respect of  the  asylum  claim,
    and [35] which was concerned with Article 8.  She  submitted  that  the
    marriage was accepted, it was just the genuineness of the marriage that
    was in issue.  She submitted that the judge had not based  his  finding
    simply on mere cohabitation: see [12] to [27], and that the  judge  had
    taken into account positive and negative aspects of the case  at  [36].
    Ms Iengar submitted that the judge had resolved his concerns at [37] by
    applying the appropriate standard of proof.  In respect of a point  put
    to her by the Upper Tribunal as to the absence of findings relating  to
    the public interest considerations, Ms Iengar submitted that these have
    been dealt with in a blanket manner at the end of [37].

 7. In reply, Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that the matter  of  weight  is
    for the Tribunal to decide but what is telling in  the  submissions  is
    that the judge does not engage with that and does not show as  part  of
    the consideration that weight is to be applied and  that  the  Claimant
    has been left in a vacuum.   She  submitted  it  is  possible  to  have
    cohabitation  without  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.   The
    judge's brief references give no indication as to how that  balance  is
    resolved and the judge had to deal with both conflicting sides and show
    how it weighed in the Claimant's favour.

 8. I found material errors of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and announced my decision at the hearing.  I now give my
    reasons.

     Findings

 9. Whilst  I  accept  that  the  judge  does  distinguish  the  Claimant's
    credibility in respect of her  asylum  claim  and  the  credibility  in
    respect of the Article 8 assessment based on the Claimant's marriage to
    and relationship with D M, who is now a British citizen,  I  find  that
    the judge made a number  of  conflicting  findings.  At  [35]  he  held
    "Neither the appellant nor her husband,  both  of  whom  gave  evidence
    before me,  gave  the  appearance  of  being  a  couple  and  in  other
    circumstances I would have rejected their relationship on this  basis".
    The judge then went on to find that there was evidence of  them  living
    in the same address in the form of bank statements from  February  2018
    only. In respect of their oral  evidence,  the  judge  noted  that  the
    evidence about the tenancy  agreement  was  inconsistent,  the  tenancy
    agreement is only in the Claimant's husband's name,  the  Claimant  was
    unaware whether the rent was paid weekly or  monthly  and  whether  the
    rent was �100  or  �103.   Further  inconsistencies  were  whether  the
    Claimant's family would accept her  husband  who  is  from  Kosovo  and
    whether there would be tension due to the  religious  differences,  the
    Claimant stating there would be  a  religious  issue  and  her  husband
    stating that there would not.

10. At [37] the judge held as follows:

         "However, despite  these  discrepancies  in  the  evidence  and  my
         concern as to whether they were in a genuine relationship, applying
         the  appropriate  standard  of  proof,  namely   the   balance   of
         probabilities in  respect  of  the  Article  8  ECHR  claim,  I  am
         satisfied that they had been living together  for  2  years  before
         their marriage in January 2017 and therefore they  would  meet  the
         requirements of partners in any event, whether  or  not  they  were
         married.  Mr M is a British citizen and is employed as a bricklayer
         on an annual salary of �19,000.   Taking  all  these  factors  into
         account, I consider it would be disproportionate for the  appellant
         to return to the Philippines and her appeal under  Article  8  ECHR
         should therefore be allowed."

11. The difficulty with this finding  is  that  the  conflict  between  the
    judge's findings based on the inconsistencies between the  evidence  of
    the Claimant and her husband have not been resolved properly or at all.
     In light of such inconsistencies it is incumbent upon a judge to  make
    a finding, e.g. as to the amount of rent paid, as  to  whether  or  not
    there  would  be  a  religious  issue  given  the  family's   different
    religions, and whether there was any further evidence which  would  tip
    the  balance  in  addition  to  the  somewhat   limited   evidence   of
    cohabitation.  On this basis, I find there is merit in the  grounds  of
    appeal and submissions on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State  in  that
    there is an inadequacy of clear and proper reasons upon which the judge
    could allow the appeal on the basis of Article 8.

12. For the reasons set out above, I find material errors  of  law  in  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet.  I set that decision aside
    and remit the appeal for a hearing de novo in respect of the Article  8
    aspect of the case only, there having been no challenge to the findings
    in respect of asylum as  a  result  of  which  the  asylum  appeal  was
    dismissed.

                           ________________

                              DIRECTIONS

                           ________________

1. The appeal should be listed for a hearing de novo at Hatton Cross.

2. The time estimate is three hours.

3. If either party requires an interpreter then that should be requested  at
least 14 days in advance of the hearing date.
