Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Bond of Counsel instructed by Irving & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 19  December  1977.   She
    appeals the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer on 13 January  2016
    to refuse her application for an entry clearance as the spouse  of  the
    sponsor, who is a British citizen.  The refusal was on the  basis  that
    the applicant did not  satisfy  the  suitability  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules in that it was alleged that the appellant had  failed
    to pay charges in accordance with the NHS Regulations.  In relation  to
    Article 8 while the appellant might have a family life with her husband
    there was no satisfactory reason why he could not join the appellant in
    Nigeria.  There were no exceptional circumstances.  Review  was  sought
    of the refusal and the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  on  23  August  2016
    maintained the original decision but raised a new hurdle based  on  the
    record of the interview with the sponsor.  It  was  said  that  further
    concerns were raised regarding the relationship  and  he  was  now  not
    satisfied that the appellant had a family life  with  the  sponsor  and
    that in any event the couple could live  together  in  Nigeria.   There
    were no exceptional circumstances.

2.   At the hearing before the First-tier Judge the Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer, Ms Parr, conceded that the suitability ground for refusal  was
    no longer relied upon as satisfactory payment arrangements had been put
    in  place  in  compliance  with  Home  Office  policy.   Following  the
    interview it was not accepted that the appellant had a family life with
    the sponsor.  Reliance was placed on Kwok On Tong [1981] Imm AR  214  -
    notice of refusal was not equivalent to a pleading and if new  elements
    of the Immigration Rules came into play they were to be dealt  with  on
    the appeal.  While the Entry Clearance Manager had expressed doubts  as
    to the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the sponsor
    no specific aspect  of  the  Immigration  Rules  had  been  identified.
    However Ms Parr stated that she did not accept  that  the  relationship
    was genuine and subsisting.  Reference was made to paragraph  E-ECP.2.6
    of the Rules.

3.   The judge went on to consider the findings in a previous appeal by  the
    appellant  which  had  come  before  First-tier  Judge  Manuell  on  18
    September 2015.  The judge notes that Judge Manuell had  made  a  clear
    finding that he found the appellant and  the  sponsor  to  be  credible
    which had been supported by the independent evidence of  the  sponsor's
    brother.  Judge Manuell had accepted that  the  appellant  and  sponsor
    were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  The  judge  accordingly
    found in the light of the guidance in  Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT  00702
    that he regarded the findings of  fact  made  by  Judge  Manuell  as  a
    starting point but added "however I am entitled to consider  new  facts
    or any facts not considered at the previous appeal which may be capable
    of producing a different outcome".

4.   The determination continues

         "13. I have also had regard to the case of Chomanga (binding effect
             of unappealed decisions) Zimbabwe  [2011]  UKUT  00312  (IAC).
             The head note of which states:


                  'The parties are bound by unappealed findings of fact  in
                  an immigration judge's decision.  It is therefore not open
                  to the respondent following a successful and  unchallenged
                  appeal by an appellant to make a further adverse  decision
                  on the same issue relying on the same evidence  as  before
                  unless there is evidence of fraud or one of the exceptions
                  identified in para 35 of the  judgment  of  the  Court  of
                  Appeal  in  Secretary  of  State  v  TV  [2008]  EWCA  997
                  applies.'


         14.  However, I find that the principles set out in Chomanga do not
             apply in  the  present  case.   Firstly,  I  note  that  [the]
             appellant's appeal before FTTJ Manuell  was  not  allowed  and
             therefore no  basis  for  the  respondent  to  challenge  that
             decision.  Second, the respondent is not relying upon the same
             evidence, but new evidence  of  the  responses  given  by  the
             sponsor during an interview.   Thirdly,  paragraph  5  of  the
             Decision and Reasons  reveals  that  the  respondent  was  not
             represented at the hearing and the  circumstances  surrounding
             it.  The circumstances  before  me  are  very  different,  the
             sponsor's evidence has been  tested  and  reveals  significant
             shortcomings.


         15.  I have also  had  regard  to  Goudey  (subsisting  marriage  -
             evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041 (IAC) which  confirmed  that
             following GA ("Subsisting" marriage) Ghana* [2006] UKAIT 00046
             the  appellant   must   demonstrate   that   the   matrimonial
             relationship continues at the relevant time rather  than  just
             the formality of a marriage.  Whilst no particular evidence of
             mutual devotion is required I find that there are a number  of
             countervailing  factors  generating  suspicion   as   to   the
             intentions of the parties.


         16.  Having heard the oral evidence of the sponsor, I found him  to
             be vague and unconvincing.  For example the  sponsor,  in  his
             oral evidence, stated that he decided to get  married  to  the
             appellant 2 days after meeting her at a  friend's  party,  but
             when asked why he decided so quickly he stated that he decided
             to get married 1 month later.  He then stated that the  reason
             for deciding to get married was that they were from  the  same
             background.  The sponsor also gave a confused and inconsistent
             account of the periods that he and the appellant were said  to
             have lived together whilst the appellant was in  the  UK.   He
             initially stated  that  after  they  got  engaged  they  lived
             together between November 2013 to July 2013,  however  in  his
             interview he stated that the appellant had returned to Nigeria
             during this time (Q.43, 46-47).  When this  contradiction  was
             brought to his attention he then stated that he meant that  he
             lived with the appellant upon her return from Nigeria in  July
             2014, but this was also in contradiction to what he stated  in
             his interview where he stated that he and  the  appellant  did
             not live  together  until  after  the  wedding  on  17.10.2014
             (Q.43).  In addition  to  these  inconsistencies  the  sponsor
             confirmed that he  did  not  visit  the  appellant  after  she
             returned to Nigeria on 7.10.2015.  Whilst the  sponsor  stated
             that he communicated with the appellant every day the evidence
             submitted (at p.237-245) did not predate  2017.   The  sponsor
             also stated that he supported his wife  by  sending  financial
             support in the sum of about ï¿½200 a month and relied upon money
             transfer receipts (P.246-25).  However, I do not find these to
             be reliable documents.  This is because  these  documents  are
             standard pro-forma completed in  manuscript  with  nothing  to
             identify by whom they were completed.  The information in  the
             pro-forma suggests that the money was transferred into a  bank
             account, however, there was no evidence that such  an  account
             existed or whether such sums were indeed credited to the  said
             account.  The  credibility  of  these  documents  are  further
             undermined by the reference  numbers  which  are  sequentially
             inconsistent with the dates upon which the transfers are  said
             to have taken place.

         17.  FTTJ Manuell made his decision on the evidence before  him  as
             at date of that hearing, namely  11.9.2015.   I  must  make  a
             decision on the evidence before me  as  at  the  date  of  the
             respondent's decision, namely 13.1.2016.  Clearly it  is  must
             be possible for the quality and nature of  a  relationship  to
             change.  At the relevant date  I  find  that  based  upon  the
             evidence before me that the relationship between the appellant
             and her sponsor was not subsisting nor  am  I  satisfied  that
             they intend to live together permanently.  Consequently I find
             that the appellant fails  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
             immigration rules."

5.   The judge referred to Secretary of State v SS (Congo) [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    387 and concluded his determination as follows:

         "20. Given my finding above I do not accept that family life exists
             between  appellant  and  her  sponsor.   I  am  therefore  not
             satisfied that the impact of the  decision  is  sufficient  to
             engage the potential operation of Article 8.  This is  because
             whilst any decision to remove a person from the United Kingdom
             will almost  invariably  engage  the  potential  operation  of
             Article 8, the instant decision does no more than to  preserve
             the status quo.  However, if I am held to  be  wrong  in  this
             view,  I  am  satisfied  that  that  having  regard   to   the
             appellant's inability to meet the eligibility  requirement  of
             the rules and bearing in mind the public interest requirements
             of Section 117B and guidance in SS Congo I conclude  that  the
             decision in this case is in accordance with  the  law  and  is
             necessary and proportionate in a democratic society  in  order
             to maintain the economic well being of the country through the
             consistent application of immigration controls.   In  reaching
             this conclusion, I have had  regard  to  the  absence  of  any
             evidence that the appellant or  her  sponsor  would  face  any
             significant difficulties in furthering their family life, such
             that it is, with her sponsor in Nigeria or in making a further
             application for entry clearance to the United Kingdom."

6.   Grounds of appeal were settled (not by Ms Bond).  It  was  stated  that
    the notes of interview had only been produced at the hearing before the
    First-tier Judge and neither the appellant nor  the  sponsor  had  been
    provided with the notes before the  hearing.   The  wrong  standard  of
    proof had been applied and reliance had been placed on suspicion by the
    First-tier Judge in paragraph 15 of his determination.   Judge  Manuell
    had made a positive finding in respect of the relationship having heard
    oral evidence from the parties.  The judge had found that  the  parties
    were plainly truthful witnesses and their evidence had  been  supported
    by independent evidence in particular medical evidence confirming their
    respective medical histories.  The  sponsor's  brother  had  taken  the
    trouble to make a long journey to court to support the appeal  and  the
    evidence was accepted  in  full.   Judge  Manuell  commented  that  the
    appellant's visits to the United Kingdom had all been  entirely  lawful
    pursuant to her multiple entry visas.  On  advice  she  had  sought  to
    extend her stay beyond her original  intended  return  date  and  Judge
    Manuell was satisfied that she had had good reasons for  doing  so  and
    that she intended to return to seek entry clearance from Nigeria  as  a
    spouse and there was no reason to suppose that  the  application  would
    not be granted promptly.

7.   The appellant did indeed return to  Nigeria  to  make  the  application
    which is the subject of this appeal.

8.   It was argued that the First-tier Judge had erred  in  considering  the
    guidance in Devaseelan and the facts  relied  on  were  not  materially
    different from those before First-tier Judge Manuell.   The  judge  had
    erred in finding the sponsor "unconvincing" which indicated that he had
    applied an incorrect standard  of  proof  in  assessing  the  sponsor's
    evidence  which  had  already  been  accepted  as  entirely   credible.
    Reference had been made to it being  "possible"  for  the  quality  and
    nature of a relationship to change  but  the  issue  should  have  been
    determined on the balance of probabilities not an  assessment  of  what
    might be possible.

9.   The judge had misdirected himself in distinguishing Chomanga as it  had
    been  held  in  Mubu  [2012]  UKUT  00398  (IAC)  that  the  Devaseelan
    guidelines were to be applied to a determination  of  a  factual  issue
    regardless of whether the decision had been appealed or whether or  not
    the appeal had been allowed.  It was  irrelevant  whether  or  not  the
    respondent had been represented in the previous proceedings.

10.  The sponsor had been diagnosed as suffering with Type 1 Diabetes.   The
    evidence had been before the judge.  Such a  condition  could  lead  to
    periods of confusion.

11.  A response was filed on 3 October 2017 in which it was argued that  the
    First-tier Judge had been entitled to depart from the findings made  by
    Judge Manuell.  Adequate reasons had been given for the findings.

12.  Counsel relied on the grounds.  She pointed out that the appellant  had
    intended to return to Nigeria but had had an operation and she had also
    looked after her husband who suffered from diabetes.  The  NHS  charges
    had been paid.  The vague answers given by the sponsor should have been
    seen in the light of the fact  that  diabetes  caused  confusion.   The
    standard of proof had been set too high.  Suspicion was not enough.

13.  In answer to a question from Miss Holmes Counsel pointed out  that  all
    the evidence regarding diabetes had been before Judge Manuell.

14.  Miss Holmes expressed concerns that the medical evidence had  not  been
    mentioned by the First-tier Judge and it had been clearly  relevant  to
    the alleged vagueness of the sponsor's replies.

15.  While the representatives were in agreement that the determination  was
    flawed Ms Bond did not accept that the  decision  should  be  reversed.
    She referred to the delay.  There  was  discussion  about  the  various
    options for dealing with the appeal.

16.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I can  of
    course only interfere with the conclusions of the First-tier  Judge  if
    they were materially flawed in law.

17.  The hearing would not have been a  straightforward  one  for  the  then
    representative as one issue  -  the  NHS  charges  -  was  dropped  and
    evidence  relating  to  the  second  issue  was  only  served  at   the
    proceedings.

18.  It is not necessary to decide whether the judge misdirected himself  in
    approaching the Devaseelan  guidelines  though  at  least  two  of  his
    reasons for distinguishing Chomanga appear doubtful in the light of the
    grounds of appeal which I have referred to above.  The second reason  -
    the new evidence - relates as I have said to material  only  served  at
    the hearing. Miss Holmes properly accepts and indeed raised  the  issue
    of the medical evidence not having been taken  into  account  when  the
    findings in  relation  to  the  sponsor's  evidence  being  "vague  and
    unconvincing" were reached. I agree with the representatives  that  the
    decision is flawed in law.

19.  I note that further evidence was submitted  under  cover  of  a  letter
    dated 9 November 2017 covering some 91  pages.   The  degree  of  fact-
    finding required in this case is considerable.  While I am  sympathetic
    to the point raised by Counsel about delay it does appear to me that  a
    fresh hearing is required before a different First-tier Judge.

20.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is  remitted  to  be  heard
    afresh by a different First-tier Judge.
