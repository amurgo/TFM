                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Obhi, promulgated on 5th January 2017,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 8th December 2016.  In  the  determination,
    the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.  For the avoidance of doubt the reference to  the  Appellant
    is a reference to the Appellant as she was below, and the reference  to
    the Respondent is to the Secretary of State as  was  the  case  in  the
    Tribunal below.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Pakistan, who was born on  23rd
    February 1989.  She appealed against the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Entry  Clearance  Officer  dated  25th  August   2015,   refusing   her
    application to join her  Afghan  national  husband  in  the  UK,  Abdul
    Bashir.   The  Notice  of  Refusal  raised   concerns   regarding   the
    Appellant's  income,  the  relationship,  and  the  concern  that   the
    Appellant may have given false information in her application.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant claimed  that  the  relationship  was  genuine,  that  no
    misrepresentation had been made, and that her  husband,  Abdul  Bashir,
    worked on a permanent contract with  Universal  Care  Services  Limited
    earning there equivalent of �9,572.29 for the last  six  months,  which
    would give him a projected income of �19,144.58 per annum.   The  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  was  forwarded  a  contract  of  employment,   bank
    statements from the Halifax Bank, receipts  of  his  salary  into  that
    account.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge took into account that  a  letter  from  the  Universal  Care
    Services Limited, dated 10th September 2015, explained that the Sponsor
    was paid an allowance, which was not shown on the P60, and which was  a
    non-taxable allowance for travel, time/fuel.  This amount of  �1,335.15
    for the year in question, would have brought the Sponsor's income up to
    �9,572.29 for six months and �19,144.58 for the year.  The  judge  held
    that  the  "non-taxable"  allowance  could  not  be  included  in   the
    calculation of the Sponsor's income.

 5. Nevertheless, the judge proceeded to allow  the  appeal  on  the  basis
    that,  in  circumstances  where  the  Appellant  did  not   use   false
    representations in her application,  and  in  circumstances  where  the
    information provided by HMRC was not itself accurate, the  Sponsor  was
    working for UK Haircut Limited, earning between 22nd September 2014 and
    1st March 2015, a total sum of �1,365.  This was for five  and  a  half
    months.  An income earned in the  twelve  month  period  prior  to  the
    application, which was for a job that he was doing at the same time  as
    his other main occupation, was therefore additionally also available.

 6. The judge went on to state that, all those calculations, could even  if
    it is assumed that he worked for five months with UK  Haircut  Limited,
    that would equate to �3,276.00 for twelve months  and  �16,473.00  from
    his income from Universal Care Services".  This would  make,  according
    to the judge's calculations, "a total in that twelve  month  period  of
    �19,749.00" (see paragraph 24).  The  judge  went  on  to  state  that,
    "there is no dispute that the Appellant's husband  "meets  the  minimum
    threshold now, therefore even though he gave up his work for UK Haircut
    Limited, it is significant to  note  that  he  continues  to  meet  the
    minimum requirement throughout his employment" (paragraph 25).

 7. In allowing the appeal, the judge stated that the ECO in Islamabad  did
    not have information relating to the Sponsor's  work  with  UK  Haircut
    Limited.  The information obtained from HMRC  was  not  accurate.   The
    judge concluded that the Appellant and her husband had "done their best
    to address the issues raised by the ECO" and that it was the case  that
    "they have suffered a lot of hardship and distress in  trying  to  deal
    with these matters, the Sponsor had to go to Pakistan in order  to  get
    his marriage registered in Afghanistan,  at  great  personal  financial
    cost" (paragraph 28).

 8. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application from the  Secretary  of  State  are  to  the
    effect that the judge had wrongly combined the Sponsor's income over  a
    twelve month period (at paragraph 24) by  observing  that  the  Sponsor
    worked for UK Haircut Limited  for  five  and  a  half  months  and  at
    Universal Care Services for twelve months, prior  to  the  application.
    However, the Sponsor had only worked for five and a half months for  UK
    Haircut Limited.  He had not worked for the full  twelve  months.   The
    actual income for the twelve month period prior to the application, for
    the tax year 2014 to 2015,  was  �7,556.93.   The  fuel  allowance  had
    rightly been disallowed by the judge.  The judge had accordingly erred.
     Moreover, the fact that the Sponsor's salary now purported to be  over
    the �18,600 threshold was irrelevant because the date of  the  decision
    was the relevant date for deciding  whether  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules could be met.

10. On 11th August 2017, permission to appeal was granted by the  Tribunal.
    It was ruled that the decision of the judge was not in accordance  with
    paragraph 13(A) of Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules, and not  in
    accordance with paragraphs 13(B) and 15 of the appendix.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me  on  6th  October  2017,  the  Respondent  was
    represented by Miss H Aboni, a Senior Home Office  Presenting  Officer,
    and the Appellant was represented by Mr R  Martin,  of  Counsel.   Miss
    Aboni relied upon the  Grounds  of  Appeal.   She  submitted  that  the
    Appellant had only worked for just over five months.  It was  wrong  on
    that basis to assume what his income would  have  been  over  a  twelve
    month period of time.  Only the actual  sum  earned  should  have  been
    taken into consideration.  She submitted that it was, of course, proved
    that  this  was  a  human  rights  appeal  (see  paragraph  28  of  the
    determination), but even so, the judge could not allow the appeal under
    human rights law, if the Appellant had not met the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules at the time of the decision of the ECO.

12. For his part, Mr Martin submitted that there were two questions  before
    this Upper Tribunal.  First, whether there was an  error  made  by  the
    judge.  Second, whether that error was a material error.  The judge had
    given  consideration  to  the  Appellant's  income  from  two  separate
    sources, namely, from Universal Care Services (with  respect  to  which
    the information was before the ECO), and from UK Haircut Limited  (with
    respect to which the information was not before the ECO).  If  one  now
    added the income from the two sources, which one knew to have  been  in
    existence at the time of the decision,  the  Sponsor  would  have  been
    earning �17,838.  This was a shortfall of only �763, from  the  �18,600
    income that had to be shown.  Had  the  Sponsor  known  that  his  non-
    taxable allowance for travel, time/fuel of �1,335.15 could not be taken
    into account, in the calculation of his yearly income,  he  would  have
    carried on working for another two months, and not stopped  after  five
    and a half months with UK Haircut Limited, which was a decision that he
    only took because he thought that his non-taxable fuel allowance  would
    have been taken into account by the decision maker.

13. In reply, Miss Aboni submitted that a miscalculation  on  the  finances
    was a material error of law.   The  Appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    minimum income threshold requirement under the  Immigration  Rules.   I
    should make a finding of an  error  of  law,  but  a  consideration  of
    Article 8 ECHR still needed to take place, given that this was a  human
    rights appeal.

No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

15. First, this is a case where the only error made  by  the  judge  is  to
    extrapolate from the Appellant's five and  a  half  months  of  working
    (which is undisputed) with UK Haircut Limited, into a period of  twelve
    months working (which the Appellant did not do), but this  was  in  the
    context of a human rights appeal.  Here, the Appellant, at the time  of
    the  hearing  referred  to  the  minimum  threshold  requirement   (see
    paragraph 25), and the Sponsor's explanation for not  having  continued
    working for UK Haircut Limited,  for  the  remaining  six  and  a  half
    months, to complete the  full  taxable  year,  was  that  he  had  been
    "wrongly advised by the solicitors at the time that he  could  use  the
    additional allowance" (paragraph 23), which was  his  travel  and  fuel
    allowance.  Otherwise, there was no reason for the Sponsor not to  have
    carried on working, particularly given that his purpose in so doing was
    to enable him to reach the �18,600 minimum  threshold  requirement,  so
    that he could sponsor his wife to come to the UK.

16. Secondly, the  ECO  did  not  have  information  with  respect  to  the
    Sponsor's earnings from UK Haircut Limited at the time of the  decision
    so that that decision was wrong on the financial side of things in  any
    event, together with the decision that the  Appellant  could  not  have
    been validly married because a national  of  a  different  country  had
    married in Pakistan (see paragraph 27 of the determination).

17. Third, the ECO also, at the time of the decision, had a situation where
    the information obtained from HMRC was not accurate,  although  as  the
    judge properly accepts, the ECO was not to  be  blamed  for  this.   As
    against all of this, it was relevant to any Article 8 ECHR  evaluation,
    that, "this Appellant and her husband have done their best  to  address
    the issues raised by the ECO" and that, "they have suffered  a  lot  of
    hardship and distress in trying to deal with these matters, the Sponsor
    had to go to Pakistan in  order  to  get  his  marriage  registered  in
    Afghanistan at great personal financial cost" (paragraph  28),  as  the
    judge found as a matter of fact.

18. In these circumstances, the factual error  that  the  judge  made  with
    respect to the Appellant's earnings from UK Haircut Limited, which  was
    only for a period of five and a half  months,  would  not  in  a  human
    rights appeal,  have  resulted  in  a  different  decision,  when  that
    decision eventually came to be made, on the basis  of  the  Appellant's
    right to family life, in what was held by the judge  to  be  a  genuine
    marriage, where the Sponsor at the time of the hearing met the  minimum
    financial threshold test, and would continue to do so  in  the  future.



Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
