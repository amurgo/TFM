                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on [~] 1969.   He  appeals
    the determination of a First-tier Judge following a hearing on 25  June
    2018 to dismiss  his  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  respondent
    refusing his application for leave to remain on the basis of Article  8
    on 23 August 2017.  The appellant arrived in the UK  unlawfully  on  25
    January 2002.  He married on 17  November  2011.   His  wife  had  been
    granted asylum on 10 February 2009.  The couple  have  a  daughter,  R,
    born on 16 January 2012.  The appellant applied for leave to remain  on
    the basis of his marriage on 5 July 2012.  Leave was  granted  until  9
    February 2014.  On 11 September 2013 the couple had twin daughters born
    on 5 February 2014.   The  appellant's  leave  was  extended  until  16
    January 2017.  However, on 6 October 2014  the  appellant's  leave  was
    curtailed  because  the  respondent  alleged  that  the  appellant  had
    fraudulently obtained a  TOEIC  certificate  which  had  been  used  in
    support of his application on 5 July 2012.  The  appellant's  wife  has
    been granted British citizenship.

2.   At the hearing before the First-tier Judge  Mr  Paramjorthy,  who  also
    appears before me, told the judge that he intended to adduce no witness
    evidence and that the appeal would proceed on the basis of  submissions
    and provided the judge with a bundle running to 688 pages -  the  judge
    records that the only reference at the hearing to any of the  documents
    was to the respondent's refusal letter.

3.   In relation to the  allegation  that  the  appellant  had  fraudulently
    taken an English language test by proxy Mr Paramjorthy  submitted  that
    that the material relied upon by the  respondent  was  insufficient  to
    prove the alleged fraud.

4.   The judge, however, having properly addressed himself to  the  evidence
    and authorities, considered that the evidence adduced by the respondent
    was sufficient to shift the evidential burden on to the  appellant  and
    the appellant had chosen not  to  give  evidence  himself.   The  judge
    concluded in paragraph 20 as follows:

         "In my judgement, the overwhelmingly probable inference that it  is
         proper for me to draw is that the appellant had and has  no  answer
         to the assertion that he cheated the system by  causing  his  TOEIC
         test to be taken by proxy.  I so find".

5.   The judge records that Mr Paramjorthy then submitted that "even if  the
    appellant was found to be a fraudster and cheat" he should nevertheless
    be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom on Article  8  grounds  on
    the basis that he was married  to  a  British  citizen  and  had  three
    children in the UK.  The judge proceeded on the footing that if it  was
    found that the appellant had cheated  and  abused  the  system  it  was
    highly unlikely that he would meet the suitability requirements of  the
    Rules.  The judge notes "it was a matter of concession on the  part  of
    Mr Paramjorthy that the appellant does not meet  any  of  the  relevant
    Rules whether in Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE".

6.   The judge records that when considering Article  8  outside  the  Rules
    reliance was placed on his marriage and three children.

7.   The judge notes that the appellant's  daughter  was  aged  6ï¿½  and  the
    twins were almost 5.  None of the children had been in the country  for
    seven years.  The judge observed that while the appellant's wife was  a
    British citizen it was  not  suggested  that  she  did  not  have  dual
    nationality.

8.   The judge did not find anything exceptional or compelling in  the  case
    of children who had not resided in the country for seven years.   Until
    the age of 4 or 5 the life of  a  child  "revolves  very  substantially
    around its parents and, usually, especially  its  mother".   There  was
    nothing exceptional or compelling about an appellant who had  practised
    deception.  The judge found that  the  appellant's  circumstances  were
    neither exceptional nor compelling.  The judge reminded himself  of  SF
    (Albania) [2017] 120 where the Tribunal had found:

         "... save in cases involving criminality, the decision  maker  must
         not take a decision in relation to the parent or primary carer of a
         British citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force the British citizen child to leave the EU, regardless of  the
         age of that child".

    The judge commented that the case before him did involve a parent

         "... who has been involved in criminality, albeit not convicted  by
         a criminal court.  Criminality will sometimes (and  perhaps  often)
         be apparent to the  Tribunal,  notwithstanding  that  the  criminal
         conduct  has  not  been  met  with   prosecution   and   subsequent
         conviction".

9.   The judge then undertook an Article 8  assessment  on  the  alternative
    basis that that was necessary.  The judge found that the family enjoyed
    strong family life and that Article 8 was engaged.  In considering  the
    issue of proportionality the judge had in  mind  Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control was in the  public  interest  and  little
    weight should be given to private life established at  a  time  when  a
    person was in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  The family had the choice
    of remaining together as a family unit by relocating to Sri Lanka.  The
    judge considered that the appellant's wife's asylum status  had  ceased
    to  be  relevant  given  the  passage  of  time.   Alternatively,   the
    appellant's wife and children could remain in the United Kingdom if the
    appellant was required to depart.  The British children  would  not  be
    forced to depart the United Kingdom - it was a matter of choice.   They
    could choose to relocate to Sri Lanka.  The judge had in  mind  Section
    55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  and  the
    principle that the sins of the parents were not to be visited upon  the
    children.  Although no reference had been made to any of the  documents
    in the appellant's bundle the judge did refer to  documents  concerning
    the very earliest stages of the children's engagement with the  outside
    world by way of nursery  or  infant  school.   Having  referred  to  AM
    (Pakistan) [2017] EWCA Civ  180  the  judge  adopted  a  balance  sheet
    approach to the proportionality exercise, concluding his  determination
    as follows:

         "42. When I undertake the hypothetical (balance sheet) approach  to
             the proportionality exercise, by weighing the factors for  and
             against a particular conclusion,  it  seems  to  me  that  the
             following matters are of importance (albeit that I do not  set
             them out in any supposed order of importance):

             (i)   The  fact  that  those  who  flout  and/or   abuse   the
                  immigration laws and system of this country should not  be
                  seen to gain advantage therefrom.  That, in my  judgement,
                  is essential if both the public in this country and would-
                  be migrants from abroad are to have confidence in it being
                  a fair system which does not reward those  who  choose  to
                  abuse or circumvent it.  (This  is  an  important  factor,
                  seemingly overlooked by those who do not sit regularly  in
                  this jurisdiction and so do not appreciate the  extent  to
                  which abusive attempts are made to flout and or circumvent
                  our immigration system).

             (ii) Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
                  Act 2002.

             (iii)    The fact that the appellant's children share no  part
                  of the blame for the appellant's deception and dishonesty.

             (iv) The fact that  this  family  has  the  choice  to  reside
                  together, in Sri Lanka.

             (v)  The fact  that  if  the  appellant  has  to  depart  this
                  country, but his wife and children choose to  remain  here
                  (as they would be entitled  to  do),  although  that  will
                  cause a dislocation to the current extent of family  life,
                  that is a consequence of the  appellant's  wrongdoing  and
                  places these children in no significantly  worse  position
                  than  children  who  find  that  their  father  has   been
                  sentenced to a significant period of imprisonment.

             (vi) The fact that there has been no suggestion, let alone any
                  evidence, to the effect that the appellant and/or his wife
                  would be unable to find suitable employment in  Sri  Lanka
                  and/or be  unable  to  provide  adequate  housing,  income
                  and/or other necessities for the  family  if  resident  in
                  that country.  -

             (vii)    The fact that statutorily I must  give  significantly
                  less weight to family life built up in this country during
                  a period when  the  appellant  has  been  here  illegally.
                  However, by analogy with Appendix FM,  para  EX1,  I  need
                  also to consider whether it can be said that it would  not
                  be reasonable to expect the children, or any of  them,  to
                  leave the United Kingdom.  It  is  my  judgement  that  it
                  would not be unreasonable, given that the  children  would
                  remain in the bosom of their family unit if  the  decision
                  is taken that each member of the family should relocate to
                  Sri Lanka.  In my judgement none of the children  has  yet
                  put down the kind of deep roots envisaged by Lord  Justice
                  Elias over a sufficiently lengthy or significant period of
                  time in his/her life as to allow it to  be  said  that  it
                  would be unreasonable for that child  to  live  elsewhere,
                  within the bosom of his/her family.

         43.  When I place those various factors into the balance and, as is
             necessary in my judgement,  give  substantial  weight  to  the
             important factor identified at 42(i) above, it is my judgement
             that it would not be disproportionate to require the appellant
             to depart the United Kingdom.  I appreciate  that  this  might
             present the family with a difficult choice to  make,  but  the
             difficulty of that choice is not, in itself,  something  which
             renders  it  disproportionate  to  require  the  appellant  to
             depart".
10.  There was an application for permission to appeal.  Although there  was
    an application in respect of the finding made by the judge in  relation
    to the procuring of the English language certificate it was  determined
    that that ground had little merit given that the respondent's  evidence
    discharged the evidential burden and the appellant had  chosen  not  to
    give oral evidence.  The judge had been entitled to reach his  findings
    on the available evidence.

11.  It was however considered arguable that the  judge  had  been  somewhat
    dismissive of the higher courts' approach to Article 8  in  immigration
    appeals and whether he had ignored binding authorities  with  which  he
    disagreed and whether he was approaching the  matter  in  an  impartial
    way.  It was arguable that he had  proceeded  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant had engaged in criminality in the absence of conviction.

12.  At the hearing it was accepted by Counsel that  the  TOEIC  aspect  was
    effectively unchallenged and the case  had  proceeded  on  submissions.
    However, it was submitted that the judge had ignored the decision of SF
    (Albania).  This had to be seen in the light of his  criticism  of  the
    Upper Tribunal's decisions  in  paragraph  36  of  his  decision.   The
    determination contained personal  opinions,  not  judicial  ones.   The
    appeal had not been heard justly.

13.  Ms Willocks-Briscoe acknowledged that the determination contained  some
    comments which did not add anything.  However, if one had regard to the
    findings made by the judge  it  was  quite  clear  that  he  had  given
    consideration to SF (Albania).  It was quite correct  that  the  family
    had a choice to make.  The children were not being required  to  leave.
    The effect on the children given their ages would not be unduly  harsh.
    The children could remain in the UK with their mother.  This was not  a
    case where the primary carer was being removed.

14.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was flawed  in
    law.

15.  I have carefully considered the submissions.  This was an unusual  case
    in that the allegation of fraud was not answered by  the  appellant  as
    the judge found the evidential burden had  shifted  and  the  appellant
    chose not to give oral evidence.  The challenge to  this  part  of  the
    judge's findings was found to have little merit - correctly in my  view
    - and was not pursued by Mr Paramjorthy.

16.  It is correct that there are some passages in the  determination  which
    were not necessary  and  could  with  advantage  have  been  left  out.
    However, I do not find that the judge misdirected himself in respect of
    SF (Albania) or was dismissive  about  Tribunal  or  other  authorities
    because of what he said about, for example, criminality or what he said
    in paragraph 36 of his decision  about  unjustified  assumptions  being
    detectable in decisions of the higher courts  "and  perhaps  the  Upper
    Tribunal".  Objection is taken to the judge's use of  the  term  "third
    world" but when the remarks are read in context it is quite clear  that
    the judge was criticising the approach that regarded all things in  the
    western world as superior.

17.  While the judge's comments could best  have  been  avoided,  I  am  not
    satisfied that it is remotely arguable that he allowed what was said to
    influence his findings or his view of the decisions which  he  referred
    to.  Since his decision the Supreme Court has given its judgment in  KO
    [2018] UKSC 53 and there is nothing in the judge's approach  that  goes
    contrary to that  decision.  In  fairness  to  the  First-tier  Judge's
    critique of the decisions of the Courts and Tribunal, Lord Carnwath  in
    the Supreme Court did acknowledge in paragraph 57 of the judgment  that
    "...  there  have  been  significant  differences   of   approach   and
    conflicting decisions at each level" in the years  leading  up  to  the
    Supreme Court  decision.  Nevertheless  the  judge's  comments,  as  Ms
    Willocks-Briscoe accepted, added nothing and could usefully  have  been
    omitted.

18.  Having given careful  consideration  to  the  points  made,  I  am  not
    satisfied that the judge's conclusions were materially flawed  in  law.
    He correctly adopted the balance sheet approach.   For  the  reasons  I
    have given this appeal  is  dismissed.   Because  the  appeal  involves
    children I make an anonymity direction.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

The First-tier Judge made no fee award and I make none.
