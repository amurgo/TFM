For the Respondent:    Mr C Lam, instructed by David Tang & Co.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. By my decision promulgated on 31 January 2017 I found that the First-
    tier Tribunal made an error of law. I now re-make the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal.  For convenience, in this decision I refer to Mr
    Atwa (the respondent) as the appellant.

 2. This appeal concerns the appellant's application for a residence card
    as confirmation of a right of residence as the spouse of an EEA
    national. The First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant and his
    wife, who is a national of Poland, were not in a marriage of
    convenience and that their marriage by proxy in Egypt was valid. These
    findings were not challenged at the error of law hearing and were
    preserved.

 3. The reason I found there to be an error of law is that the First-tier
    Tribunal failed to consider whether the marriage was valid in Poland,
    the country of the EEA national, as required by Kareem (proxy marriages
    - EU law) [2014] UKUT 24 (IAC).  The issue before me today therefore is
    whether there is a valid marriage in Poland.

 4. The appellant has adduced a Polish marriage certificate (along with a
    translation) dated 31 January 2017 showing that the marriage in Egypt
    is recognised in Poland. The authenticity of the certificate has not
    been challenged.

 5. I am satisfied that the appellant has adduced sufficient evidence to
    demonstrate that his marriage is valid in both the country where it
    took place, Egypt, and the country of his EEA national wife, Poland.
    Accordingly, he has met the requirements in Kareem and on that basis
    his appeal is allowed.

 6. Since the error of law hearing the issue in this appeal has been
    considered by the Court of Appeal in Awuku v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 178
    where it was concluded that Kareem was wrongly decided and that it is
    not necessary to consider the law in the EEA national's country.
    Accordingly, following Awuku, I would have found in the appellant's
    favour even if he had not provided the evidence of the marriage being
    registered in Poland.
