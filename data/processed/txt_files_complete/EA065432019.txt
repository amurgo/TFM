Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Gazzain, instructed by Law Lane Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This has been a remote hearing to which there has  been  no  objection
      from the parties. The form of remote hearing was skype for business. A
      face to face hearing was not held because it was not practicable,  and
      all issues could be determined in a remote hearing.

   2. The appellant is a Pakistan national  born  on  21  January  1985.  He
      appeals, with permission,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision  to
      refuse to issue him  with  a  residence  card  under  the  Immigration
      (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  as  the  dependant  direct
      family member (son) of an EEA national exercising treaty rights in the
      UK.

   3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 23 September 2009  with  a
      Tier 4 student visa valid  until  31  October  2010  and  was  granted
      extensions of leave on the same basis until 19 April 2015. On  20  May
      2014 he applied for a residence card  as  a  dependant  direct  family
      member of his father, Shabbir Mohammad, a Swiss  national,  which  was
      issued on 28 July 2017, valid until 28 July 2022.

   4. On returning to the UK from a holiday in Pakistan on 7 April 2019, the
      appellant was refused admission and his residence card was revoked  on
      12 August 2019. The reason for that decision was that  the  respondent
      was  not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  was  a  qualified  person  in
      accordance  with  regulation  6  of  the  EEA  Regulations  2016.  The
      appellant appealed against that decision.

   5. The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Anthony
      on 6 September 2019 and was dismissed in a decision promulgated on  11
      September 2019.

   6. In that decision, the judge recorded the evidence that the appellant's
      father, the EEA national sponsor, had lived in Switzerland from August
      2018 until January 2019 and had not  worked  in  the  UK  during  that
      period and that at the time of the appellant's  immigration  interview
      on 7 April 2019 his father was in Switzerland and he was  not  certain
      when he would be returning to the  UK.  Both  the  appellant  and  his
      sponsor had confirmed at interview that the sponsor was  not  employed
      at the time. On the basis of that  evidence  the  judge  rejected  the
      documentary evidence submitted to show that the sponsor was working in
      the UK for C21Zone Ltd from July 2018 until April 2019  and  concluded
      that  the  documents  had  been  manufactured  and  the  evidence  was
      untruthful. The judge rejected the assertion  made  that  the  sponsor
      retained worker status as a result of looking after his  son  who  was
      ill in Switzerland and concluded that the respondent  was  correct  to
      refuse admission. However the judge  accepted  that  the  sponsor  was
      working in the UK from May 2019, for C21Zone Ltd and  that  he  was  a
      qualified person at the time of the hearing. Nevertheless, in light of
      evidence that the appellant was working and  earning  around  ï¿½1200  a
      month,  that  the  sponsor  was  earning  below  the  minimum   income
      threshold, that the sponsor had given evidence at  interview  that  he
      was financially supported by the appellant and that the appellant paid
      the rent and was named on the tenancy agreement, and in the absence of
      any evidence of the sponsor's  claimed  savings,  the  judge  did  not
      accept that the appellant was dependent upon the  sponsor.  The  judge
      considered the appellant's evidence of financial dependency  upon  the
      EEA national sponsor to be a total fabrication and concluded  that  he
      could not satisfy the conditions in regulation  7(1)(b)  as  a  direct
      dependant of the sponsor.

   7. Less than two weeks after that decision, on  23  September  2019,  the
      appellant applied again for a residence card  as  a  dependant  family
      member. The respondent refused the application on  18  November  2019,
      noting that most of the evidence relied upon  was  the  same  as  that
      previously considered by the First-tier Tribunal. The respondent noted
      that the council tax bill for the appellant's address only  named  the
      sponsor and that there was no evidence to show that the sponsor  could
      afford to pay the rent on the property and  support  himself  and  the
      appellant on his earnings. There were no bank statements  showing  any
      other further income to which the sponsor had access and  no  evidence
      of the sponsor's financial support for the appellant nor  evidence  of
      the sponsor paying rent, bills etc.  The  respondent  noted  that  the
      appellant was now claiming to be unemployed but no reason was given as
      to why that was the case. The respondent did not consider there to  be
      sufficient evidence of residence with, or dependency upon, the sponsor
      and did  not  accept  that  the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of
      regulation 7.

   8. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was  heard
      on 11 February 2020 before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Howorth.  The
      judge noted the appellant's claim that he had lost his job and had  no
      earnings, but found there to be no evidence of that. The  judge  noted
      that he had produced evidence of  only  one  out  of  his  three  bank
      accounts and, given the adverse findings previously made against  him,
      she did not accept that he was no longer working. The judge had regard
      to the evidence of the sponsor's employment and accepted that  he  was
      working, but was not able to ascertain from the evidence what  he  was
      earning. As for the question of dependency, the judge noted that there
      was insufficient evidence of corresponding  transactions  between  the
      appellant's and sponsor's accounts and also noted the lack of evidence
      to explain payments going out of the appellant's account shortly after
      the payments claimed to have been made from the sponsor. The judge did
      not accept that the appellant was  dependent  upon  the  sponsor.  The
      judge accepted that the appellant and the  sponsor  resided  together,
      but did not  accept  that  that  was  in  itself  sufficient  to  show
      dependency, given the concerns about the evidence overall.  The  judge
      was not satisfied that  the  appellant  had  shown  that  he  met  the
      requirements of regulation 7(b)  and  she  accordingly  dismissed  the
      appeal.

   9. Permission was sought by the appellant to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
      on two grounds: firstly, that the judge's reasoning on  the  issue  of
      dependency was flawed  under  Dauhoo  (EEA  Regulations  -  reg  8(2))
      Mauritius [2012] UKUT 79, as prior dependency and  current  membership
      of the same household was sufficient to meet the dependency test;  and
      secondly, that the judge had failed  to  consider  material  evidence,
      including additional bank statements and payslips for the sponsor.

  10. Permission to appeal was  granted  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      respondent filed a rule 24 response, relying on  the  cases  of  Reyes
      (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 314 and Chowdhury (Extended  family
      members: dependency) 2020] UKUT 188 in asserting that the first ground
      was not made out, and that the second ground failed to  establish  any
      material error by the judge.

Hearing and Submissions

  11. The matter then came before me for a remote hearing by  way  of  skype
      for business and both parties made submissions on  the  error  of  law
      issue.

  12. Mr Gazzain expanded upon  the  grounds,  relying  on  Dauhoo  and  the
      appellant's membership of the same household as his father, as well as
      the references in Reyes to dependency being based  upon  a  number  of
      factors including family unity and emotional dependency, none of which
      had been considered by the judge. Mr Gazzain submitted that the  judge
      was wrong to require evidence that the appellant had stopped  working,
      as that was not something which could  be  demonstrated  by  evidence.
      Further, the judge had failed to consider additional evidence  in  the
      bundle of transfers of funds from the sponsor to the appellant,  which
      showed that there was a dependency. Mr Gazzain referred  to  the  fact
      that the sponsor had been granted indefinite leave  to  remain  on  30
      September 2019 under the EU Settlement Scheme  and  he  was  therefore
      accepted as being a qualifying person.

  13.  Ms Cunha relied on the case of Chowdhury, where it was found that the
      dependency had to be continuous, which was not the case. She submitted
      that the judge was entitled to make the adverse  credibility  findings
      that she did and to reach the decision that she did. In  response,  Mr
      Gazzain submitted that Reyes made  it  clear  that  there  had  to  be
      present dependency, which the appellant had demonstrated.

Discussion

  14. I do not agree with Ms Cunha's reliance on Chowdhury in regard to  the
      dependency having to be continuous, as that was  clearly  specifically
      related to regulation 8 and the particular wording of that regulation,
      whereas the appellant's  application  was  made  under  regulation  7.
      However, I find no merit in the appellant's grounds of challenge.

  15. In a decision made only two weeks before the appellant's  application,
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Anthony gave detailed reasons for concluding
      that his claim to be dependent on his EEA national sponsor was a total
      fabrication as there had been clear evidence  from  the  EEA  national
      that in fact he  was  financially  supported  by  the  appellant.  The
      sponsor's evidence, as set out at [40] of that decision, was that  the
      appellant financially supported him, that the appellant's name was  on
      the tenancy agreement and that the appellant paid the rent, and  there
      was evidence in the form of payslips that the appellant earned  around
      ï¿½1200 per month and the sponsor earned less than  the  minimum  income
      threshold. That decision was not challenged, as far as I am aware. Yet
      less than two weeks later, in a further application, it was stated  on
      behalf of the appellant that he was not working  and  was  financially
      dependent upon  the  sponsor,  with  tenancy  agreements  showing  the
      sponsor as the named tenant. The appellant now seeks to challenge  the
      respondent's decision, and the decision of Judge Howorth upholding the
      respondent's decision, on the basis that they had erred in law in  not
      accepting that evidence.

  16. It was Mr  Gazzian's  submission  that  Judge  Howorth  erred  by  not
      accepting the appellant's claim to no longer be working. He criticised
      the judge for expecting the appellant to be able to  produce  evidence
      of not working and submitted that it was not possible to provide  such
      evidence. However, given that the appellant  had  previously  provided
      evidence of his employment before  Judge  Anthony,  it  was  perfectly
      reasonable for Judge Howorth to expect  him  to  produce  confirmation
      from his previous employer that he no  longer  worked  there  and  the
      reason for him having ceased working. In light of the adverse findings
      made by Judge Anthony, Judge Howorth was fully entitled to reject  the
      appellant and  sponsor's  unsupported  evidence  to  that  effect,  in
      particular since the appellant had not produced evidence  of  all  his
      bank accounts, as pointed out at [16] of the judge's decision.

  17. As for the assertion in the  grounds  that  Judge  Howorth  failed  to
      consider material evidence, I cannot see that that is the case. I have
      carefully looked through the appeal  bundle  which  was  before  Judge
      Howorth and I see no omissions, and certainly no  material  omissions,
      from her recording of the sponsor's income, at [18] to  [21],  and  of
      the transactions from the sponsor to the appellant, at [27] and  [28],
      and no errors in her assessment of that evidence at [21] to  [25]  and
      [29]. The judge gave a detailed account of the concerns  arising  from
      that evidence and the absence of evidence which  ought  reasonably  to
      have been produced, at [25], [26], [29] and [31], and it seems  to  me
      that she was perfectly entitled to draw the adverse  conclusions  that
      she did in that regard and to conclude  that  the  appellant  was  not
      financially dependent upon the sponsor. In so far as Mr Gassain relied
      upon evidence in a new bundle which  he  said  addressed  the  judge's
      concerns and showed further evidence of income  and  provided  further
      insight into the funds transferred to the appellant from the  sponsor,
      and then transferred by the appellant to another of his own  accounts,
      that was not evidence before the judge and is therefore  not  relevant
      to the error of law issue before me.

  18. It is asserted further in the grounds and by Mr Gazzain that the judge
      erred by failing to follow the guidance in Dauhoo and  by  failing  to
      conclude that dependency was established by the  appellant  living  in
      the same household as the sponsor. However,  neither  the  regulations
      themselves nor the interpretation  provided  in  Dauhoo  or  elsewhere
      establish that dependency arises simply by living in the same house as
      another person. What has to be shown is that the applicant is a member
      of the EEA national's household. That was precisely the point made  by
      Judge Howorth at [30] of her decision. Given that  Judge  Anthony  had
      made  findings  previously  that  the  appellant  paid  the  rent  and
      supported the sponsor financially, Judge Howorth was fully entitled to
      conclude that the fact that the sponsor's name appeared on the tenancy
      agreement  was  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  relevant  test,   when
      considered with the rest of the evidence.

  19. As for Mr Gazzain's submission that the judge  failed  to  follow  the
      guidance in Reyes at [19], that there had to be an examination of  all
      the facts and all elements of the relationship,  that  the  underlying
      objective was maintaining the unity of the family, and that  the  test
      was one of present and not past dependency,  I  find  nothing  in  her
      decision that is inconsistent with that approach. The judge  undertook
      a detailed and careful assessment of all  the  evidence  and  provided
      cogent reasons for finding that the  appellant  had  not  demonstrated
      that he was dependent upon his EEA  national  father.  She  was  fully
      entitled to reach such a conclusion on the evidence before her.

  20. For all of these reasons I consider that the grounds of appeal do  not
      disclose any errors of law requiring the judge's decision  to  be  set
      aside. The judge was entitled to make the adverse  findings  that  she
      did, for the reasons fully and cogently given.

DECISION

  21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal stands.
