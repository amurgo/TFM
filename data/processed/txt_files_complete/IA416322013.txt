                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Algeria, born 2nd December 1967.  He says
    that he entered the UK unlawfully on 25th December 1999.  He first came
    to the  attention  of  the  immigration  authorities  when  encountered
    working illegally on 11th July 2008.  His wife is a UK citizen, born on
    2nd March 1961.  They married  on  15th  February  2012.   Through  his
    solicitors, he sought leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis  of  his
    marriage.  The Respondent refused  that  for  reasons  explained  in  a
    letter dated 25th September 2013.   The  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  leave  to
    remain as a spouse, and with regard to paragraph EX.1.1(b) had  "failed
    to demonstrate ... insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with  your
    wife continuing outside the UK" (paragraph 13).  The letter went on  to
    private life considerations, and then said at paragraph 19:

      Only in exceptional circumstances will a decision made in  accordance
        with the Rules lead to a breach of Article 8.  However, as you have
        not raised any exceptional circumstances it is not considered  that
        your removal would have unjustifiably harsh consequences for you or
        that removal of your application is disproportionate.

 2. The letter at paragraph  24  again  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had
    established family life with his British wife, and that  removal  would
    interfere with private and family life in a manner sufficiently serious
    to engage Article  8(1),  but  considered  that  removal  would  be  in
    accordance with the law, would pursue a legitimate aim  of  maintaining
    immigration control, and removal would not be  disproportionate,  under
    reference to the established case law.

 3. Judge Quigley  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by determination promulgated on 27th February 2014.

 4. The Appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal on grounds which (shorn  of
    supporting case references) are in summary:

    (i)    The criterion of "insurmountable obstacles" has to be read in  a
         manner compatible with Article 8 ECHR, and is a criterion disavowed
         in the case law.  Although the Tribunal referred to  the  criterion
         of reasonability in the following sentence at paragraph 30, it  was
         unclear whether the Tribunal properly understood the criterion  and
         that "insurmountable obstacles" is not to be interpreted literally.

    (ii)   The Tribunal failed to take account of weighty factors  relevant
         to whether the Appellant and his wife should relocate  to  Algeria,
         such as:

         (a)      spouse's nationality; integration of the Appellant  within
             the  UK;  spouse's  lack  of  connection  with  Algeria;   the
             reasonability of expecting her to relocate there as the  price
             of  keeping  her  marriage  intact;  the  situation   of   the
             Appellant's wife who has lived all her life in  the  UK  as  a
             citizen with an  inalienable  right  of  abode;  detailed  and
             anxious   consideration   necessary    before    finding    no
             insurmountable  obstacles  to  her  emigrating   and   finding
             accommodation and work  in  a  foreign  country  to  keep  her
             marriage intact;

         (b)      the fact that the Appellant's wife  cannot  speak  Arabic,
             has no ties with Algeria apart  from  the  Appellant  and  has
             lived all her life in the UK.

    (iii)  Error in the alternative finding that the Appellant could return
         to apply for entry clearance - failure to ask whether there  was  a
         sensible reason for requiring such return.   Esto  that  is  wrong,
         failing to apply relevant factors to whether it  was  sensible  for
         the Appellant to return, including prospective length and degree of
         disruption and whether other family members  are  in  the  UK.   It
         should have been found that the Appellant's spouse is in the UK and
         is British.  The separation is likely to be longer than six  months
         because six months' wage slips  are  required,  plus  further  time
         needed for entry clearance application to be decided  such  a  time
         limit a factor in  making  return  to  apply  for  entry  clearance
         disproportionate  -  such  factors  demonstrative  of   exceptional
         circumstances and unjustifiably harsh consequences in terms of  the
         length and degree of separation between Appellant and spouse.

      i) If it is said that the judge did take account of these factors, the
         judge erred by failing to  explain  how  these  factors  have  been
         assessed in reaching the decision both in respect of relocation  to
         Algeria and in respect of the  finding  that  the  Appellant  could
         return to apply for entry clearance.  If it is said that the  judge
         has given adequate explanation, the  judge  erred  by  reaching  an
         irrational decision.

 5. (I observe in passing that there  is  no  apparent  requirement  for  6
    months wage slips to post-date an applicant's departure  from  the  UK,
    and that it must be doubtful whether there could  be  adequate  reasons
    for an irrational decision.)

 6. Mr Winter said that the main issues raised  in  the  grounds  were  (i)
    whether an incorrect test of insurmountable obstacles was applied,  and
    (ii - iii) whether there was failure to take any real  account  of  the
    relevant  factors  in  reaching  the  proportionality  assessment.   He
    submitted further as follows.  The judge was wrong in considering  that
    EX.1 did not apply in a case of this nature, a point  accepted  by  the
    Respondent in the refusal  letter.   Although  the  judge  went  on  to
    consider  the  case  in  the  alternative  (�20-29)  she  repeated  the
    incorrect phrase in reaching her conclusion (�30).   The  determination
    did narrate (�22-24 in  particular)  why  the  Appellant's  spouse  was
    unwilling to relocate to Algeria, but  her  only  link  there  was  her
    husband.  She has spent all her life in the UK  and  her  family,  job,
    house  and  all  other  connections  are  here.   These  are   material
    considerations  not  factored  into  the  proportionality   conclusion.
    Although  the  judge  after  repeating  the  error  of   referring   to
    insurmountable obstacles as a decisive test at �30 went on to state her
    conclusions in terms  of  reasonability  of  relocation,  that  was  an
    insufficient rectification.  It remained in doubt whether  the  correct
    test had  been  applied.   The  factors  previously  mentioned  in  the
    determination had  not  been  factored  in  when  that  conclusion  was
    reached.  On ground (iii), whether  it  was  reasonable  to  expect  an
    application to be made from Algeria, the reality was that this is not a
    case raising the "Chikwamba" issue, because the financial  position  of
    the Appellant's spouse is such  that  there  is  no  real  prospect  of
    meeting the financial requirements for his return to the UK.  Mr Winter
    took me through the case law vouching the various propositions on which
    he  relied.   He  submitted  that  there   were   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences of removal in this case  and  to  expect  the  Appellant's
    spouse to relocate was  so  unreasonable  that  a  decision  should  be
    substituted allowing the appeal outright.

 7. Mr Mullen submitted that the grounds were essentially only disagreement
    with the judge's assessment of the practicalities  of  the  Appellant's
    wife relocating to Algeria.  The issue whether it was proportionate for
    him to make an application from Algeria was only an alternative  matter
    and not of essential importance, because it did not appear that he  had
    provided evidence that he was likely to succeed in any application made
    from Algeria.  Even if the judge had gone wrong in thinking that  there
    was a "Chikwamba" issue, the outcome of the case would  have  been  the
    same.  The judge found that the Appellant had not succeeded in  showing
    a right to remain in the UK notwithstanding  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, and there was  no  reason  to  interfere  with  that
    conclusion.  Much was now made of the Sponsor having  to  give  up  her
    employment in the UK, but  even  if  the  judge  did  not  specifically
    mention that, it must have been obvious to her as part of the  outcome.
    There was no reason to think that the Appellant would not  be  able  to
    work in Algeria  and  to  support  them  both.   The  Appellant  listed
    numerous factors which the judge was said to have  overlooked,  but  in
    fact they were all rehearsed (�21 to  26)  and  referred  to  again  in
    deciding whether there was a case outside the Rules  (�  33).   Reading
    the determination fairly and as a whole it was plain that the judge  in
    fact applied an overall reasonableness  test,  not  a  strict  test  of
    "insurmountable obstacles".  She also looked to see whether  there  was
    any case for success outside the  Rules.   The  Appellant  had  a  long
    history of evading immigration controls and his lack of status  in  the
    UK was always plain to  him  and  to  the  Sponsor.   All  the  factors
    enumerated in the case law were properly taken  into  account  on  both
    sides.  Nothing in the case references required the outcome  to  be  in
    favour of the Appellant.  It was not an error of law for the  judge  to
    come down on the side which  she  did.   The  ECHR  cases  showed  that
    inability to speak the language in a country was a factor, but none  of
    them said that it was determinative.  Any  complaints  made  about  the
    determination went only to its form not to its substance  and  did  not
    amount in the end to more than disagreement.  This  was  a  case  where
    there were factors on both sides, as summed up for  example  in  Izuazu
    (Article 8 - new Rules) [2013] Imm AR 3 at �69 (one of the passages  to
    which Mr Winter had referred), and there was  no  error  in  the  judge
    coming down on the side which she did.

 8. Mr Winter in response pointed out that in  all  those  cases  in  which
    Appellants had succeeded there was some  adverse  immigration  history,
    and that Izuazu is such an example.   Although  the  Respondent  argued
    that the judge took account of all  factors  within  the  determination
    there was no assessment of the fact that the Appellant's wife has spent
    all her life in the UK, does not speak Berber or Arabic, has  her  job,
    house and family all here and has no ties apart  from  her  husband  in
    Algeria.  Failure to take account of these material considerations  was
    such an error of law that the determination ought to be reversed.

 9. I reserved my determination.

10. The Appellant's and his wife's side of the case has been pressed before
    me as strongly as it could be, in terms of all relevant legal principle
    and all relevant supporting factors.  However, I unable to identify any
    material error of legal approach by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  She
    may have gone wrong in thinking that  EX.1  of  the  Rules  was  not  a
    provision by which the Appellant might succeed, but that played no part
    in the outcome.  She went on to consider the question of insurmountable
    obstacles in terms which plainly did not treat that criterion literally
    but as a question of what might reasonably be expected of  the  parties
    in all the circumstances.  The conclusion at the end of �30 is this:

       I do not accept the submission that the Appellant's wife  could  not
       reasonably be expected to relocate to Algeria and  that  removal  of
       the Appellant will be a disproportionate breach of  their  right  to
       family life.

11.  That  conclusion  must  have  been  open  to  the  judge.    All   the
    considerations on which the Appellant  and  his  wife  relied  such  as
    medical difficulties, her lack of family connections  in  Algeria,  her
    inability to speak the language, her  job  and  home  in  the  UK,  are
    plainly  set  out.   The  judge  turns  to  the  correct  criteria  for
    consideration outside the Rules at �33 - "a  good  arguable  case"  and
    "compelling and compassionate circumstances".  I find no error  of  law
    in how the judge approached the decisive issues, and how she struck the
    balance.

12. The same answer to  the  error  of  law  question  can  be  reached  by
    considering �69 of Izuazu:

      The Strasbourg case law indicates that weighty reasons are needed  to
        justify expulsion of someone who has had long residence as a  child
        or  that  would  risk  separating  devoted  partners  in  a  family
        relationship.  It may, by  contrast,  require  weighty  reasons  or
        exceptional factors to outweigh the strong  justification  for  the
        expulsion of those who  entered  by  deception,  remain  by  fraud,
        establish their  relationship  in  the  host  state  in  precarious
        circumstances and never had an expectation of  being  permitted  to
        remain to conduct their family and private life in the host state.

13. Weighty reasons were  needed  in  this  case  to  risk  separating  the
    parties; but the judge missed out nothing of what that  might  involve.
    On the other hand, strong justification for expulsion  was  present  in
    the Appellant's history of entering by deception, remaining unlawfully,
    establishing his  relationship  while  both  knew  he  was  here  under
    precarious circumstances, and he had  no  other  expectation  of  being
    permitted to remain.  It could not realistically be said that the  case
    was capable of lawful resolution only in the Appellant's favour.

14. In my opinion, the Appellant has not identified any error by the  judge
    which requires her determination to be set aside, and the determination
    shall stand.
