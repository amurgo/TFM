                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


  1. This is an appeal against the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr L  A
     North, promulgated as long ago as 9 October 2002.  The Appellant,  who
     is a male citizen of Jamaica born in 1959, appealed to the Adjudicator
     against the Secretary of State's decision in  March  2002  to  make  a
     deportation order against the Appellant on the ground that his removal
     would be conducive to the public good.  This was because the Appellant
     had been convicted of robbery in June 1999.

  2. The Adjudicator dismissed the appeal under both the Immigration  Rules
     and on human rights  grounds.   The  Tribunal  refused  permission  to
     appeal in November 2002 but Judicial Review of that was sought and the
     decision of the Tribunal was quashed by consent in an Order  dated  23
     September 2003 and stamped 13 October 2003.

  3. The basis upon which the refusal of leave to appeal  was  quashed  was
     that the Adjudicator was said to have disregarded certain evidence  on
     the grounds that he was precluded by section 77(4) of the  Immigration
     and Asylum Act 1999 from having regard to  it.   It  was  said  to  be
     arguable that that was an error in particular  in  the  light  of  the
     Tribunal's decision in SK [2002] UKIAT, 05613.

  4. The application for permission to appeal therefore  came  back  before
     the Tribunal, this being a Judicial Review  rather  than  a  Statutory
     Review case, and it was granted in a determination  dated  21  October
     2004 and notified on 29 November 2004.  The reason for  delay  in  the
     application for permission  to  appeal  coming  before  the  Tribunal,
     following the quashing of its earlier decision, does not  appear  from
     the file.  It was a common  but  unsatisfactory  feature  of  Judicial
     Review  that  the  successful  applicant  might  feel  no  urgency  in
     notifying the Tribunal of his success  and  the  losing  Secretary  of
     State, who had a contrary interest, might not have regarded it as  his
     obligation to do so instead.  It may on the other hand be  that  there
     was an administrative inefficiency at the Tribunal.  We do not know.

  5. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom in 1987  as  a  visitor  with
     four weeks leave to enter  and  was  granted  a  six-month  extension,
     during which time he married and  thereafter  was  granted  indefinite
     leave to remain.  He was divorced in October 2001;  but  the  marriage
     had ended as a relationship in  the  early  nineties;  there  were  no
     children of that marriage.

  6. His immigration history and his alleged offending behaviour  had  been
     interwoven to some degree.  His September 1994 arrest,  in  connection
     with the search of car in which a knife and a forged fifty pound  note
     were found, had occurred when he was sitting in the driver's seat of a
     car hired by Valmore Talbot;  he said that his true identity  was  CM,
     the name on a letter from British Rail in his possession.  But he  had
     been returned to  Jamaica  as  Valmore  Talbot;   there  he  had  been
     believed to be CM, had been returned to England, where  Ms  Cole,  his
     son's mother, had brought his Jamaican passport to the  airport.   The
     Secretary of State's refusal letter said that he had been given  leave
     to enter as returning resident CM,  having  been  removed  as  illegal
     entrant Talbot.  There seems to have been some connection  with  a  Ms
     Talbot, and her application to enter was associated with his file.

  7. He had been wrongly alleged to be a Neville  Smith  when  arrested  in
     1995 for possession of crack cocaine;  it was at  court  that  he  had
     been recognised to be CM.  He was acquitted.

  8. The offence which has led to the decision under appeal  was  committed
     in January 1999.  The sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Gerber in
     June 1999, following the Appellant's conviction by the jury, described
     the offence as "very serious indeed', "... this was a plan,  in  which
     another woman was laid as a bait in the street, got  the  unsuspecting
     victim to come to the door of the house, you drag  him  in,  and  then
     produce a knife, which we have seen, hold it to his  throat  and  then
     proceed to rob him of all his money.  Having held him for some  twenty
     minutes, when the street is clear,  he  is  bundled  into  the  street
     without his money and threatened not to report it to the police."   He
     was sentenced to five years in imprisonment.   No  recommendation  for
     deportation was made.  He blamed the offence on drug  taking  and  the
     woman who he said  had  instigated  it.   He  had  only  one  previous
     conviction for handling  a  stolen  credit  card,  for  which  he  had
     received a prison sentence.

  9. The Appellant's evidence to the Adjudicator was that he had a daughter
     in the United Kingdom by one woman, but he did  not  know  where  they
     were.  He also had a son in the United Kingdom by another woman.  Both
     children were about seven years old at the time of  the  Adjudicator's
     hearing, combining his statement and his grounds of  appeal,  although
     other material  suggests  the  daughter  was  four  years  older.   In
     November 2001,  in  prison,  he  married  another  woman,  a  Jamaican
     national living in the United Kingdom, who has  now  sought  leave  to
     remain as the spouse of a person present and  settled  in  the  United
     Kingdom.

 10. He said that he was remorseful of his  past  actions,  wanted  now  to
     provide for his family, had room for his son to visit, was involved in
     a local community group, but if deported would be unable to seek entry
     clearance to visit his son or  to  maintain  telephone  contact.   The
     son's mother had been expected to attend the Adjudicator's hearing; he
     did not know why she had not done so.  He also had good  prospects  of
     full-time, permanent responsible employment and he had put his time in
     prison to good use.  He spoke to his son three times a  week,  aspired
     to staying  in  contact  and  paid  varying  amounts  of  maintenance,
     irregularly.

 11. The Adjudicator considered paragraph 364 HC 395 which provides  for  a
     striking  of  a  balance  in  deportation  cases  between  the  public
     interest, compassionate circumstances and the aim of  consistency  and
     fairness.  He also set out the appropriate approach to Article 8 ECHR,
     save that he erred, in the light of SK, in construing section 77(4) of
     the 1999 Act as confining his attention to the facts as at the date of
     the SSHD's decision.

 12. The Adjudicator concluded that the  Secretary  of  State's  policy  of
     deporting those convicted of violent offences was not wrong, that  His
     Honour Judge Gerber's sentencing remarks and  the  five-year  sentence
     showed the seriousness of the robbery offence.  It was a "particularly
     serious offence".  In considering  the  counter-balancing  factors  in
     paragraph 364 of HC 395, the Adjudicator pointed to the absence of any
     matters making return to Jamaica unduly difficult.  This was where the
     Appellant had spent his formative and a significant part of his  adult
     years.

 13. There was no connection remaining with his first wife.  His statements
     showed no continuing connection with the daughter or her mother.   The
     Adjudicator accepted a continuing contact with the  son  as  described
     above.  From Jamaica, the Appellant could continue to  telephone,  and
     could  seek  visiting  contact  through  entry  clearance.    It   was
     significant to the Adjudicator that the son's mother had not  attended
     to give evidence in support.  There was no evidence as to  the  effect
     on the son of any loss of or reduction in contact with the  Appellant,
     though the son valued the  fortnightly  contact  visits.   Deportation
     would  constitute  a  significant,  partial  interference   with   the
     Appellant's family life with the son.  Some forms of contact could  be
     maintained.  The Appellant's wife could return to Jamaica with him and
     thus each could continue their  family  relationship.  His  employment
     skills and community links could be maintained  in  Jamaica,  although
     they might take a different form.

 14. The Adjudicator then examined the Appellant's past record.  He did not
     accept at face value the Appellant's past denial of dissembling  about
     his identity and was persuaded that he gave and had been  deported  in
     the false name  of  Talbot.   He  also  rejected  the  denial  by  the
     Appellant that a false name had been given  on  arrest  in  1995.   It
     concerned the Adjudicator that the probation officer had assessed  him
     as having a fourteen percent chance of re-offending.

 15. Overall, the Adjudicator concluded that the  gravity  of  the  offence
     outweighed  the  compassionate  circumstances  relied  on  under   the
     Immigration Rules.   There  would  be  a  significant  impact  on  his
     relationship with his son but  some  form  of  telephone  or  visiting
     contact would be maintained.  His relationship with his wife could  be
     maintained on return to Jamaica.    There was no breach of Article  8.
     The appeal was dismissed.

 16. The Appellant  contended  that  the  Adjudicator  had  erred  in  four
     respects.  He had failed to appreciate  the  full  extent  of  contact
     between the Appellant and his son, and there was also further evidence
     now to support the extent of that relationship;  his reasoning on  the
     material was inadequate or had ignored material aspects. He  had  also
     excluded relevant post Secretary of State decision material because of
     his flawed interpretation of section 77 (4) of the 1999 Act.   Second,
     he had overstated the Appellant's ability to maintain contact with his
     son from Jamaica, and to return for contact.  Third,  the  Adjudicator
     had ignored positive aspects of the Appellant's  behaviour  in  prison
     and after release.  Fourth,  the  Adjudicator  had  misunderstood  the
     significance of the evidence about the risk of re-offending.

 17. It is not in dispute but that section 77 (4) had been misunderstood by
     the Adjudicator in the light of SK, above,  and  that  evidence  about
     matters arising after the Secretary  of  State's  decision  should  be
     taken into account in this  case  in  relation  to  all  human  rights
     aspects.  Our jurisdiction in this case covers both errors of fact and
     law.

 18. Taking first the relationship with his son, Mr Omere for the Appellant
     drew attention to what the mother had said in her statement signed  in
     September 2002 shortly before the appeal to the Adjudicator.  She  was
     in favour of the Appellant having regular access through their  agreed
     but informal arrangements and said that in the "summer  holidays"  the
     son "will be spending" the whole time with his father at the  father's
     house.  The possibility of the son moving in with the father was  also
     being discussed;  she lived in London.  An  earlier  letter  of  April
     2002 referred to  fortnightly  access,  daily  telephone  calls,  past
     contact while in prison and expected contact during  the  2002  summer
     holidays.  A letter of 5 July 2002  from  the  mother  said  that  the
     Appellant had arranged for the son to stay with him towards the end of
     July for six weeks.  The two saw each other  fortnightly  or  monthly;
     their relationship was important.

 19. The Appellant's own written evidence to the Adjudicator had stated  in
     two short sentences that he had a very good relationship with his son,
     and was anxious now to provide for his family, including the  daughter
     with whom he had lost contact.

 20. Mr Omere submitted that the more  extensive  oral  evidence  from  the
     Appellant had been that the son had stayed with him in Nottingham  for
     the six weeks summer vacation, and that there  were  discussions  with
     the mother about the  son  spending  more  time  with  his  father  in
     Nottingham.

 21.  This  was  contrasted  with  what  the  Adjudicator   said   in   his
     determination, about the absence of staying contact  but  arrangements
     being made for that in the future.  It  was  said  that  the  fact  of
     staying  contact  had  been  ignored.  The  Adjudicator  had  said  in
     paragraphs 16 and 17:

           "16.  The Appellant has given evidence that the  child  born  11
                 June 1995 is  his  son.   He  has  produced  a  copy  birth
                 certificate naming him as the child's  father  and  he  has
                 produced copies of correspondence,  stories  and  a  school
                 report to show that he maintains an interest in his son.  I
                 accept that the Appellant travels to see  his  son  on  his
                 days off and maintains contact with him over  the  phone  3
                 times a week.  His son does not have staying  contact  with
                 him but he would like to arrange that in  the  future.   He
                 says that there are no formal arrangements for the  payment
                 of maintenance but he pays amounts of between �20 and  �100
                 at times.  I find that the Appellant  has  strong  contacts
                 with his son but it does not amount  to  overnight  staying
                 contact.  His contact with his son would be reduced to  the
                 extent of his visits if the Appellant were removed from the
                 UK.  The Appellant would, if he met  the  requirements,  be
                 able to apply abroad for entry clearance to visit his  son.
                 He would also be able to maintain telephone contact.


           17.   From his son's point  of  view,  his  father's  return  to
                 Jamaica would not deprive him  of  his  main  carer  or  of
                 someone with whom he is at present having  staying  access.
                 He should be able to maintain telephone  contact  with  his
                 father albeit at a less frequent rate than the  3  times  a
                 week at present.  Subject to practical  arrangements  there
                 is no reason why he should not be able to see his father on
                 occasional visits.  I find it significant  the  mother  did
                 not attend to give evidence at the hearing.  I  also  found
                 it significant that the Appellant said he did not know  why
                 she had not attended having left that to his solicitors.  I
                 have no direct oral evidence  from  the  carer  as  to  any
                 emotional effect that reduction in contact might  have  but
                 the written statement from his mother shows that he  values
                 his fortnightly contact visits from  his  father.   I  find
                 that  the   Appellant's   removal   from   the   UK   would
                 significantly interfere with the contact he  has  with  his
                 father but the disruption would  not  total  and  could  be
                 maintained by phone and occasional visits."

 22. The Tribunal had further evidence in the form of a  witness  statement
     from the Appellant.  He was still  married  to  his  second  wife  and
     although separated from her was looking to get  back  with  her.   The
     stress of his immigration status had been a major factor, and  he  had
     lost his job.  He had discovered that his daughter was now in  Zambia,
     her mother in Canada.  He was in telephone contact with his son  three
     or four times a week;  he now saw him during holidays and at weekends.
      The son's mother was in Jamaica looking after her mother and the  son
     was looked after by her sister.  The mother had provided  no  updating
     statement for that reason.

 23. All this, it was submitted, showed the substance of  the  family  life
     which the Appellant enjoyed with the son.  It also went to the  degree
     to which for Article 8 purposes, family life had been established  and
     would be interfered with.

 24. We examined the Adjudicator's notes of evidence and, as  we  told  the
     parties, they do record the Appellant as saying that his  son  "spends
     summer holiday with me" and that his staying with the father had  been
     discussed.

 25. The second and related point in the appeal concerned the prospects  of
     the Appellant maintaining contact with  his  son  from  Jamaica.   The
     Adjudicator had concluded that telephone contact and occasional visits
     could be maintained.  But this would be a severe disruption, and  more
     severe than the Adjudicator had allowed for, because there would be  a
     minimum of three years before his return would be contemplated by  the
     Secretary of State following deportation, and the fact that he did not
     own or occupy property in the United Kingdom would  prevent  him  from
     complying with the Immigration Rules.   The  son  would  be  adversely
     affected through this loss of contact.  Contact with the daughter, now
     that her whereabouts were established, could more readily be made from
     a stable base in the United Kingdom.

 26. Taking these two points together, the Secretary of  State  through  Ms
     Ramachandran submitted in reply that the Appellant was  not  the  main
     carer for the son, had not been shown to enjoy holiday staying contact
     in fact, for the evidence was all prospective, and the son could spend
     time in Jamaica.  The absence of direct oral evidence from the  mother
     was important; the wife was silent.  Staying access was yet  to  come.
     His current wife could return to Jamaica.  He had  lost  contact  with
     his daughter.  Return was proportionate.

 27. The third point made by the Appellant was that part of  the  balancing
     factors under paragraph 364 was the personal history of the Appellant,
     his character, conduct and employment record.  The  Probation  Service
     report on him dated 17 July  2002  which  concerned  his  progress  in
     prison and on parole was very positive: he had  completed  educational
     courses in prison, attended drug  awareness  courses  and  had  become
     involved with useful groups in prison.  He had worked hard  since  his
     release in November 2001, in seeking work, he had demonstrated genuine
     remorse,  had  trained  as  a  fork-lift  truck  driver   successfully
     completing various  temporary  placements  and  was  now  (July  2002)
     seeking permanent employment.  He now (July 2002)  had  a  three  bed-
     roomed council tenancy in Nottingham.  He  had  also  become  involved
     with a homeless  persons  community  group  and  wanted  to  become  a
     community role model.  The question  was  not,  as  it  was  said  the
     Adjudicator appeared  to  think,  whether  that  group  could  survive
     without him, but what his participation positively  showed  about  his
     reformed character.

 28. It is convenient to link this  with  the  fourth  point,  the  alleged
     misunderstanding of the significance of the evidence about the risk of
     re-offending.  The Adjudicator did set out the essential  features  of
     the Appellant's conduct in  prison  and  subsequently,  and  also  his
     involvement with community groups. He said:

           "Although therefore his links with the UK do include his current
           employment he has both general  educational  and  specific  work
           place skills, which would be of use to him
           if he returned to Jamaica.


           The Appellant has produced minutes  of  a  Race  Relations  sub-
           committee and  has  given  evidence  of  his  involvement  in  a
           community action group.  I accept his involvement, which  is  to
           his credit, but no doubt those groups can function  without  the
           Appellant and  he  will  be  able  to  be  involved  in  similar
           community activities in Jamaica.


           I have taken into account the report provided by Brenda Boggild,
           probation officer and dated 17 July 2002  prepared  specifically
           for this appeal.  That report speaks well of him and the efforts
           he has made since his release  from  prison.   It  does  however
           concern me greatly that at paragraph 16 that his prison Offender
           Group Reconviction Scale score was 14%.  The  probation  officer
           says that is a low  score  as  does  the  Appellant's  advocate.
           Whatever the significance of 14% in terms actual  likelihood  to
           re-offend,  and  the  Appellant  has  not  sought  to  have  the
           probation officer explain, I find it shows there is a likelihood
           of re-offending  which  cannot  be  discounted  when  making  my
           decision."

 29. Mr Omere submitted that the Adjudicator had misunderstood the evidence
     about the  fourteen  percent  reconviction  risk,  treating  it  as  a
     significant adverse point when it was a low risk and as such  a  point
     in the Appellant's favour.  In paragraph 32, the Adjudicator had  said
     that there was "some possibility, albeit low," of  the  Appellant  re-
     offending.

 30. Mr Omere submitted that it meant that the Appellant was in a group  of
     which fourteen percent would re-offend, not that there was a  fourteen
     percent chance that the Appellant would re-offend.  There had been  no
     actual  re-offending  either.   Risk  factors  associated   with   his
     offending  had  changed  -  drug  use,  acquaintances,   homelessness,
     unemployment.  Those points were borne  out  by  a  probation  service
     letter of 17 October 2002.

 31. Ms Ramachandran submitted that the Adjudicator had dealt properly with
     the skills acquired and community group involvement.  He would be able
     to use his skills and interest in the  community  to  good  effect  in
     Jamaica.  The Adjudicator had also treated the Appellant as at  a  low
     risk of re-offending, which is what was contended,  and  accepted  the
     efforts at rehabilitation but had also  looked  at  the  very  serious
     nature of the offence and had set  it  in  the  context  of  his  past
     behaviour in the United Kingdom, including other  incidents  with  the
     police in which he concluded a false identity had been given.

 32. The grounds of appeal had also taken issue with findings made  by  the
     Adjudicator in relation to the use of false names as to which  it  was
     said the Secretary of State had failed to produce direct  rather  than
     hearsay evidence, and had sought to explain  the  connections  between
     the hired car and Mr Talbot.  These were not pursued orally.

 33. We were also provided with a number of authorities but they  were  not
     the focus of the submissions.

Conclusions

 34. Although in any particular case it is unlikely that the result will be
     very different applying the provisions of paragraph  364  HC  395  and
     Article 8 ECHR, it is worth pointing out that there  are  differences.
     First, the task of the decision-maker on appeal from the Secretary  of
     State under paragraph 364 is to decide whether the balance  struck  by
     the Secretary of State is correct in the circumstances.  This  is  the
     balance between the public interest and other relevant circumstances.

 35.  Second,  compassionate   circumstances   may   form   part   of   the
     considerations which arise under Article 8, but they do not do  so  as
     such but only where they are part of the  arguments  about  family  or
     private  life.  They  are  by  contrast  a  necessary  part   of   the
     consideration of paragraph 364.

 36. Third, it is noteworthy that  paragraph  364  with  its  reference  to
     compassionate circumstances, domestic circumstances and  all  relevant
     factors brings in the effect of deportation on  other  family  members
     who are  not  being  deported  with  the  Appellant;  thus  under  the
     paragraph the effect on the son is  relevant.  Under  Article  8,  the
     effect on the son would be limited to its consequential effect on  the
     father as the son is not being removed with  the  father.  This  means
     that the appeal available under the Rules is  wider  than  the  appeal
     available to the Appellant under the  applicable  Act  which  confines
     consideration of the human rights to those of the Appellant.

 37. The decision-maker comes to his own decision  on  the  merits,  giving
     weight to any Secretary of State policies on who should be deported or
     the gravity with which any sort of offence is  perceived  and  to  his
     decision, but the appeal decision is  for  the  appellate  body.  This
     contrasted with the pre Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, pre Huang  [2005]  EWCA
     Civ 105, review approach to  proportionality  under  Article  8.   The
     Huang decision applies to the consideration of Article 8 issues.

 38.  Fourth,  in  applying  Huang  to  deportation  cases,  as  there  are
     Immigration Rules which apply to deportation, the position  under  the
     Rules should be considered first.  If the case under the Rules  fails,
     it is very difficult to see what  factors  under  Article  8  are  not
     subsumed already in paragraph 364. Article 8 should then be considered
     with Huang in mind, but it is difficult to see how a case which  fails
     under the Rules  here  could  be  disproportionate  under  Article  8.
     However, the Article focuses on family and private  life  and  respect
     for those interests is a right which  requires  to  be  outweighed  by
     other legitimate interests:  immigration control and the prevention of
     crime.

 39. We turn to the first two grounds of appeal. It is  possible  that  the
     Adjudicator did misunderstand the evidence about the  staying  contact
     between the Appellant and his son. It is clear that oral evidence  was
     given to the effect that the son had spent the summer holiday of  2002
     with the Appellant;  the letter from  the  mother  in  September  2002
     undoubtedly reads as if it is prospective and at that  date  the  2002
     summer holidays were already over. It may be  as  Mr  Omere  suggested
     that the prospective  language  of  her  earlier  pre-summer  holidays
     letters had been carried over in her later latter of support  for  the
     Appellant. We are prepared to assume  that  the  Adjudicator  made  an
     error here and that there had already  been  staying  contact  between
     father and son in the holidays.

 40. We note that the Adjudicator refers in paragraph 18 to the  fact  that
     the Appellant would be able to apply from abroad for  entry  clearance
     "if he met the requirements" of the Rules.  The  Adjudicator  did  not
     comment on paragraph 246  which  includes  the  requirement  that  the
     applicant have accommodation which he owns or occupies exclusively,  a
     requirement  which  the  Appellant  could  not   satisfy.   But   that
     requirement seems to relate to someone  which  is  seeking  long  term
     entry in order to exercise access rights and does not apply to someone
     who seeks to enter as a visitor. The Adjudicator did  not  comment  on
     the likely period for which the Appellant would be excluded  from  the
     United Kingdom as a result of being  deported.  As  it  is  a  violent
     offence which leads to his deportation, it would  normally  be  rather
     longer than the normal three year minimum and is  likely  to  be  more
     than double that. In one sense the policy of deportation  for  serious
     offences is undermined if the  deportee  can  return  relatively  soon
     afterwards. We  have  noted  that  this  is  not  a  factor  which  is
     adequately appreciated by Adjudicators or covered in their  decisions.
     We regard this as the more  serious  obstacle  to  the  resumption  of
     contact than paragraph 246 which does not deal with the prospects of a
     visit visa or one which permitted multiple visits.

 41. It is right that the  Adjudicator  accepts  that  there  would  be  an
     interference with the Appellant's family  life  and  indeed  with  the
     son's, and that direct contact  would  be  significantly  reduced.  In
     paragraph 29, he refers to  regular  telephone  calls  and  infrequent
     access visits but he does not say whether those are to Jamaica by  the
     son or to the United Kingdom by the Appellant.

 42. The Adjudicator is correct in rejecting the notion of family life with
     the first wife, the daughter or her mother and there is nothing in the
     discovery of her whereabouts which is remotely persuasive as  a  basis
     for staying  in  the  United  Kingdom.  He  is  also  correct  in  his
     assessment that the Appellant's present wife could return  to  Jamaica
     with him, for she is a Jamaican.

 43. The Adjudicator has underestimated to a modest degree  the  extent  of
     family life enjoyed with  the  son  because  there  had  been  staying
     contact and not just the prospect of it, we conclude. It  is  possible
     that he has under-estimated the  effect  of  the  deportation  on  the
     ability of the Appellant to apply for  any  form  of  entry  clearance
     including a visit visa.

 44. We do not regard those as  significant  errors  in  the  balance.  The
     father is not, and there was no more than a speculative suggestion  at
     one time that he might become, the main carer for the son. There is no
     suggestion that the Appellant would ever live with the mother and  son
     as a family. Contact by telephone could be  maintained  from  Jamaica.
     The direct contact could not be maintained on  the  same  basis;  this
     would include visits at weekends or holidays or staying contact in the
     United Kingdom. The Appellant would be  unable  to  visit  the  United
     Kingdom for many years, but the apparent harmony  between  the  mother
     and father would mean that visits by the  son  to  Jamaica  cannot  be
     regarded as precluded.  The Adjudicator was right to  point  out  that
     the gaps between such contacts would not be so great and the  son  not
     so young that memory of the father would fade.

 45. We now turn to the third ground of appeal. There is nothing  in  this.
     The Adjudicator recognised the points made about how the appellant had
     endeavoured to improve himself after his conviction  and  release.  We
     see  the  references  to  his  employment   endeavours   as   positive
     recognition of what he had tried to do as with the credit given by the
     Adjudicator in paragraph 21 for the community involvement. He does not
     limit his consideration to whether the  groups  can  function  without
     him. The Adjudicator is also fully entitled  to  give  weight  to  the
     skills acquired for employment purposes and  to  the  fact  that  they
     could  be  used  to  his  advantage  in  Jamaica  and  so  lessen  the
     difficulties which he might face. The same approach  was  legitimately
     applied to the outlook exemplified by his involvement  with  community
     groups here: that could be applied to his benefit in Jamaica.

 46. The fourth ground of appeal has some force.  The  Adjudicator  had  an
     explanation of the 14 % which shows that there was a low risk  of  re-
     offending. The Adjudicator appears not to  give  it  the  significance
     which it warranted because he reaches the  conclusion  that  "whatever
     the significance of 14 % in terms [of] actual likelihood to  re-offend
     ... I find it shows there is a likelihood of re-offending which cannot
     be discounted when making my decision".

 47. However, the Adjudicator in that last remark is not suggesting that it
     is more probable than not that there will be re-offending, but a  risk
     which cannot be discounted. The Appellant's evidence did not show that
     there was no risk. It appears to us that the Adjudicator probably  did
     not discount the risk sufficiently by reference to that  evidence  but
     he did properly go on to make the important point that the offence  in
     question was serious and that it was his  second  conviction.  He  was
     also entitled to give weight to the Secretary  of  State's  policy  of
     treating offences of  violence  as  a  particularly  serious  type  of
     offences.

 48. Allowing for the Adjudicator to have over-estimated the degree of risk
     as suggested by  the  Probation  Report,  and  so  combined  with  the
     domestic circumstances  and  family  life  which  we  have  considered
     earlier, he had put  the  overall  position  less  favourably  to  the
     Appellant than he should have done on three counts, we  are  satisfied
     that the overall conclusion under paragraph 364 remains sound  and  we
     would reach the same conclusion in the light of what we now understand
     the position to be.

 49. This was a serious offence of violence;  it was a second offence.   We
     accept the soundness of the Adjudicator's findings as to  the  use  of
     false names.  The Appellant has endeavoured to reform himself  and  as
     the Adjudicator said there are factors favourable  to  him.   But  the
     gravity of the offence requires something far more substantial  before
     the legitimate public interest in the removal of  a  violent  criminal
     can be counter-balanced.  The low level of risk, taking the  probation
     service assessment at face value and  allying  it  to  the  change  in
     circumstances since the offence does not persuade us that the  gravity
     of the offence should not lead to deportation.  For us the significant
     point is the relationship with the son and we take  into  account  the
     effect on father and son.  We have limited specific evidence about the
     effect  on  the  son  but  we  accept  that  there  is  a   reasonable
     relationship which involves staying and parental-child  affection  and
     love.  However, the disruption would not be to the  relationship  with
     the main carer;  it is  to  some  extent  already  disrupted  by  past
     imprisonment and separation;  it is not clear  to  what   extent   the
     father ever lived with the mother.  The  telephone  contact  could  be
     maintained.  There would be scope for visits to Jamaica,  although  it
     would be many years, and significant years in the life  of  a  boy  of
     about nine now, before the Appellant could reasonably expect to return
     to the United Kingdom on a visit.  But taking all the points  together
     we do not regard the deportation as falling outside the Rules.

 50. The same qualifications need to be entered in respect of the  findings
     of the Adjudicator under Article 8.  But the same balance  is  arrived
     at by us.

 51. Accordingly this appeal is dismissed.  It is reported for what we  say
     about the interaction between Article 8 and the Rules, in  deportation
     cases.
