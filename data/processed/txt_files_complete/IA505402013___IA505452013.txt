For the Appellants:    Mr T Muman (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Pirotta  promulgated  on  10th  April  2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 7th April 2014.  In the determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of Mr Abdulateef Olasebukan  Amusa  and  Mrs
    Fatima  Oluwayemisi  Yusaf.   The  Appellants  applied  for,  and  were
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife.  Both  are  citizens  of  Nigeria.
    The first Appellant, the husband, was born  on  2nd  August  1978,  the
    second Appellant, the wife, was born on 6th December 1981.  They appeal
    against the decision of the Respondent Secretary of  State  dated  18th
    November 2013, refusing their applications to remain in the UK as  Tier
    1 (Entrepreneurs), with the wife being dependent upon  the  application
    of her husband.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he was  employed  by  three  firms,  Blue
    Arrow Employment, Krispy Kreme and Ideal Employment, and also  operated
    his own business, MECREF  Enterprises.   He  claimed  to  earn  �5,329,
    �4,672, �1,099 and  �45,076  respectively.   He  claimed  that  he  was
    entitled to 35 points for these earnings.  He submitted  his  payslips,
    bank statements, invoices, together with evidence from his accountants.



The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had regard to the fact that, given  the  Appellant's  claimed
    income of �45,076 from his business, the Secretary of  State  attempted
    to contact the persons named in the  83  invoices,  but  only  six  had
    responded, and many of the written requests were returned by  the  post
    office as "addressee unknown".  Furthermore, the tax return to the year
    ending April 2012, reported only an income of  �4,420  gross,  but  the
    Appellant's business profits were now set to be  �45,700  in  the  year
    ending 24th January 2013.  He had not  submitted  any  explanation  for
    this substantial increase in his business turnover.

 5. The judge's findings were that  "There  was  no  explanation  for  this
    discrepancy" (paragraph 15).  The fact that letters were correctly sent
    to people whose identities and addresses were known  meant  that  there
    ought to have been an adequate response.  Only a few responded and  the
    majority did not reply at all.  Many letters  were  returned.   It  was
    true that the Appellant had submitted an account of  support,  but  the
    Appellant's  explanation  that  his  outgoings  in  operating  his  own
    business were said to be �6,624 and this  was  listed  in  his  trading
    accounts, and could be explained  on  the  basis  that  he  had  bought
    computer equipment from cardboard sales and markets,  which  he  worked
    upon and restored,  and  sold  to  clients  who  provided  services  to
    computer users, was not plausible because he had submitted no  receipts
    on this respect (paragraph 16).

 6. The judge concluded that it was not credible that a bona fide  business
    which involved purchasing goods for re-sale would not  obtain  invoices
    or receipts for their purchase (paragraph 18).   It  was  not  accepted
    that the Appellant had discharged the burden of proof upon him and that
    the  invoices  generally  showed  some  charge  for   second   and   or
    reconditioned items (paragraph 19).  Consideration  was  given  to  the
    Appellant's human rights claims but these were rejected (see paragraphs
    24 to 25).

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application submit that the appellant had been  ambushed
    by the fact that matters were raised for which the Appellant was  given
    no proper opportunity to explain and the failure to  give  him  a  fair
    opportunity, to address the matters  raised  by  the  Tribunal,  before
    adverse credibility findings were made, was a  procedural  error,  such
    that there was an error of law.

 8. On 16th May 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing  before  me,  Mr  Muman,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant referred to the fact that there  was  today  a  short  bundle
    before this Tribunal and that he  would  rely  fundamentally  upon  the
    Appellant's grounds of application.  He submitted that there had been a
    fundamental failure to observe the basic  rules  of  national  justice.
    There was a common law duty of fairness.  The Appellant did not deserve
    to be ambushed.  As a matter of procedural justice any allegation  that
    was made ought to have been put to him so that he could deal  with  it.
    This had not happened.  Secondly,  the  judge  placed  disproportionate
    weight on the fact that the Appellant's customers had not given  him  a
    receipt and he was wrong to have concluded that the  business  was  not
    genuine for this reason.

10. For his part, Mr  Richards  relied  upon  his  Rule  24  response.   He
    submitted that it was not accepted that  the  business  was  a  genuine
    business.  If one could not accept the income from  the  business,  one
    could not say that the business was a genuine one.  The  invoices  were
    checked by the Home Office and a large number  of  them  were  returned
    when enquiries were made in relation to them.

11. In reply, Mr Muman submitted that the question before this Tribunal was
    simply whether there was  a  procedural  error  in  the  way  that  the
    determination had been made.  The question before this Tribunal was not
    as to the merits of the application.   Where  there  was  a  procedural
    error then it was well established that the proper course of action was
    to remit this matter back to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  again
    by a judge other than the judge who had sat on the first appeal: see MM
    (unfairness; E & R) (Sudan) [2014] UKUT 00105.

No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside this decision.  My reasons  are
    as follows.  First, the grounds place considerable  reliance  upon  the
    suggestion that the  judge  had  alleged  fraud  on  the  part  of  the
    Appellant (see Ground 1, paragraph D(i), Ground 1 (E(i)); and Ground  2
    (form (A)).  However, as the judge granting permission on 16th May 2014
    observed, this is going too far because the judge did not  assert  that
    the Appellant was guilty of fraudulent contact.  What the judge  stated
    was that the income as claimed was not a plausible  one  and  this  the
    judge was entitled to do, without making an allegation of fraud,  which
    the judge did not make.

13. Second, it is  said  that  the  judge  deprived  the  Appellant  of  an
    opportunity of addressing the very issues of one which the  judge  then
    found in  her  decision.   For  example,  the  judge  states  that  the
    Appellant had not submitted any documentary evidence for  the  purchase
    of any  computers,  parts,  hardware,  software,  or  accessories  (see
    paragraph 16) and concluded that it was not credible that a  bona  fide
    business would not obtain invoices or receipts for such purchases.  The
    Grounds of Appeal assert that no question was asked in relation to this
    matter of the Appellant, who  had  submitted  a  schedule  of  purchase
    expenditure for accounting purposes to his accountant,  and  who  could
    have  given  such  an  explanation  to  the  judge  if  given  such  an
    opportunity.

14. This, however, does not mean that the judge fell  into  any  procedural
    error of law.  The fact is that the judge did  not  find  it  plausible
    that such a degree of expenditure in relation to these particular kinds
    of quotes could not be evidenced by the production of  receipts.   That
    conclusion was an entirely sustainable one because even if the question
    had been put to the Appellant there would still have been no production
    of receipts, only a reference  to  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had
    submitted a schedule of his purchase  expenditure  to  his  accountant.
    The judge would still have been entitled to find such an explanation to
    be an implausible one.  What the judge stated was that there was a lack
    of documentary evidence.  The judge was right in this.

15. Another example of this is the criticism made of paragraph  18  of  the
    determination, where the judge states that the invoices for items  sold
    are inflated, and it is said at paragraph 19 that the invoices  do  not
    generally show some charge for the second-hand or  reconditioned  items
    stipulated.  It  is  said  once  again  (Ground  1D(i))  that  this  is
    tantamount to an assertion of fraud.  It is not.  The judge has to make
    a finding of fact and this is how the judge, in  the  entirety  of  the
    evidence before her, made her findings.  Such a finding was open to the
    judge.

16. Third, and no less importantly, it is a feature  of  the  determination
    that the judge had regard to the fact that the Secretary of  State  had
    attempted to contact persons named in the 83 invoices but that only six
    had responded, and most of them did not respond, and a number also were
    returned on the basis of "addressee unknown".  It is said that there is
    a procedural error in this because although a list was referred to  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge, by the Presenting Officer, the Appellant was
    not given any copies.

17. It is not clear why, if the Appellant felt able to deal with this as  a
    matter that could be properly explained, no request  was  made  of  the
    judge to be handed a copy of these names.  Instead,  it  is  said  that
    this is tantamount to an assertion of fraud (see  Ground  2  (paragraph
    4), (paragraph (aa))).  It is  no  such  thing.  Whereas  plainly  some
    people may well have moved on in their addresses it  does  not  explain
    why so few had responded and  a  large  number  had  simply  failed  to
    respond.  Again, the judge was entitled to come to the conclusion  that
    she did.  After all, it must not be forgotten, that the  judge  has  to
    make findings of fact in relation to these  matters.   This  the  judge
    did.

18. In short, this appeal is an  attempt  to  re-argue  matters  that  have
    already been properly decided by the judge.   Another  judge  may  well
    have decided these questions differently.  However, it cannot  be  said
    that the findings made by  this  judge  are  in  any  way  perverse  or
    irrational because they were open to the judge to make on the basis  of
    the evidence that was presented to the judge.

Decision

19. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

20. No anonymity order is made.
