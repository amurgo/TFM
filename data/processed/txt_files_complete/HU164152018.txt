Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Saini, instructed by Adam Bernard Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Eban.  For reasons given  in  his
    decision promulgated 7 March 2019, the judge allowed  the  respondent's
    appeal on human  rights  grounds.   I  shall  refer  to  him  in  these
    proceedings as the claimant.

 2. The claimant had appealed against the  Secretary  of  State's  decision
    dated 31 July 2018 refusing his human rights application for indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis of ten years'  residency  which  had  been
    made on 22 September  2016.   The  Secretary  of  State  contended  the
    application fell for refusal under paragraph 322(5).  This was  on  the
    basis that as part of an earlier application made as a Tier  1  Migrant
    on 12 October 2010 the claimant  had  claimed  to  have  an  income  of
    �58,251 from all sources between 1 September 2009 and  31  August  2010
    from his self-employment.  In a more recent application dated 26  March
    2013 the claimant had claimed to have an  income  of  �58,273  for  the
    period 1 March 2012 and 28 February 2013.  The Secretary of  State  had
    written to the claimant on 23 May 2017 asking him  to  complete  a  tax
    questionnaire and to provide either a tax summary  or  SA302s  for  the
    years for which he had been self-employed.   By  way  of  response  the
    claimant had provided a number of documents from HMRC  that  identified
    discrepancies.  Based on the revised tax calculations for  the  periods
    in question the Secretary of State contended that the points scored  by
    the claimant would have fallen short of the  number  required  under  a
    general Tier 1  application.   This  led  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    conclude it would not be desirable for the claimant to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom in the light of  his  character  and  conduct  based  on
    misrepresentation of his earnings.  Whilst acknowledging that paragraph
    322(5) is not mandatory it would have  been  a  clear  benefit  to  the
    claimant by either failing to declare his  full  earnings  to  HMRC  or
    falsely representing those earnings to UK Visas and Immigration to meet
    the points required.

 3. With reference to paragraph 276B of the rules,  it  was  contended  the
    claimant did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276D with reference
    to 276B(i) and (iii) with reference to the general grounds for  refusal
    at paragraph 322(5).

 4. The application was also considered on  the  basis  of  the  claimant's
    family and private life including his  relationship  with  Usra  Sajid,
    with the Secretary of State considering the claim under  the  ten  year
    partner route and not the parent route.  It was not accepted  that  the
    claimant  met  the  suitability  requirements  by  reference   to   the
    claimant's conduct.  With his partner having no valid leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom the claimant could not meet the requirements of E-
    LTRP.1.2. of Appendix FM and EX.1 did not apply to his case.  In short,
    the Secretary of State contended that were no insurmountable  obstacles
    to  the  family  life  continuing  outside  the  United   Kingdom   and
    furthermore I  did  not  consider  that  the  claimant's  private  life
    justified a grant of leave under the  Rules  of  by  reference  to  any
    exceptional circumstances.

 5. The judge assessed the evidence and made findings  on  the  explanation
    advanced for the differences in the figure work.  Having regard to  the
    claimant's explanation he concluded that the account of events had  met
    the minimum level of plausibility and gave detailed  reasons  for  that
    conclusion.  At [24] the judge explained:

         "24. Looking at all the evidence in  the  round  I  find  that  the
             respondent has not shown that it is more likely than not  that
             the  appellant  demonstrated  bad  character  either  when  he
             completed his applications of 12 October  2010  and  26  March
             2013 and/or when he submitted his  tax  returns  for  the  tax
             years  ending  April  2010,  2011  and  2013  or  that  it  is
             undesirable for him to be permitted to remain.  I  accept  the
             appellant's explanation of what occurred and that  he  made  a
             genuine mistake in his tax returns for the  tax  years  ending
             April 2010, 2011 and 2013."

 6. Thereafter the judge explained his conclusion that the claimant met the
    requirements of paragraph 276B of the Rules and by reference to Article
    8 allowed it on human rights grounds.

 7. The grounds of challenge by the Secretary of State  are  twofold.   The
    first is that the judge made  a  material  misdirection  of  law  on  a
    material matter.  In this instance it is argued that the absence of any
    sanction by HMRC as a result of a claimant making a  correction  of  an
    income tax return was legally irrelevant and should not  be  the  basis
    for finding that paragraph 322(5) does not apply in this case.

 8. The second ground in summary is that the judge  had  made  perverse  or
    irrational findings on matters that were material to the  outcome.   It
    is argued that given the  size  of  the  discrepancies  involved  which
    amount to tens of thousands of pounds it was irrational for  the  judge
    to conclude the claimant would not have been aware of the fact that his
    tax returns contained errors and should have sought  to  rectify  those
    errors sooner.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Boyes considered ground  1  was
    not arguable on the basis that the judge had not utilised  the  penalty
    payment issue as the sole reason or the decisive reason  as  permission
    was expressly refused on this ground.

10. In relation to ground 2, Judge Boyes considered this  arguable  on  the
    basis  that  the  judge  had  seemingly  accepted  that  instructing  a
    professional accountant absolved the claimant  of  any  responsibility.
    That was arguably wrong as a matter of common sense.  He continued:

         "If it is correct then the Home  Office  can  never  win  in  these
         cases.  The figures are strikingly different such  that  one  might
         have expected the appellant to notice.  The reasoning given by  the
         Judge as to why he prefers  the  appellant's  account  is  arguably
         deficient in terms of content and depth of that examined.  One  may
         have expected the appellant to have been asked about  checking  the
         statement etc."

11. Ms Holmes queried the position in  relation  to  ground  1  however  on
    reflection  she  accepted  it  was  unarguable  having  regard  to  the
    unambiguous grant of permission which left the only ground of challenge
    being  one  of  irrationality  or  perversity  in  ground  2.   In  her
    submissions, she argued that the judge had erred in finding  positively
    in favour of the claimant in relation to his lack of awareness  of  the
    mistakes by his accountant.  Her contention was that given the size  of
    the  amounts  involved,  the  claimant  who   holds   a   post-graduate
    qualification should have been aware.  She referred to the decision  in
    R (on the application of Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return paragraph
    322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) by Martin Spencer J sitting as a judge in
    the Upper Tribunal.  In particular the observations at paragraph 37(iv)
    as follows:

         "However, for an applicant simply to blame his  or  her  accountant
         for an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be
         the end of the matter: far from it.  Thus, the Secretary  of  State
         is entitled to take into account that, even where an accountant has
         made an error, the accountant will or should  have  asked  the  tax
         payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to  have  signed
         the tax return, and furthermore the Applicant will  have  known  of
         his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.  If,
         realising this (or wilfully shutting his eyes  to  the  situation),
         the Applicant has not taken  steps  within  a  reasonable  time  to
         remedy the situation, the Secretary of State  may  be  entitled  to
         conclude either that the error was not  simply  the  fault  of  the
         accountant or, alternatively, the Applicant's failure to remedy the
         situation itself justifies a conclusion that he has been  has  been
         deceitful or dishonest and  therefore  he  should  be  refused  ILR
         within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules."

12. Ms Holmes however accepted that the judge had referred to the  decision
    at [17].  She candidly acknowledged the difficulties  in  pursuing  the
    ground in the light of the high threshold.

13. For his part Mr Saini argued the judge had not left any of the evidence
    into account, had directed himself correctly  and  reached  conclusions
    rationally open to him on the evidence.

14. I encouraged both parties to have regard to the decision in R (Iran)  &
    Ors v SSHD {2005] EWCA Civ 982 in particular the observations of Brooke
    LJ as to the standard.

15. By way of response, Ms Holmes argued that the judge had not taken  into
    account the  timing  of  the  corrective  exercise  undertaken  by  the
    claimant although here too acknowledged candidly  that  the  judge  had
    identified the chronology.

16. Given the seriousness of the challenge, it is appropriate  to  set  out
    the relevant passages from the judge's decision between [17] and [26].

         "17. I have carefully considered all the evidence before me and the
             guidance in R (on the application  of  Khan)  v  Secretary  of
             State  for  the  Home  Department  (Dishonesty,  tax   return,
             paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  The respondent has
             relied on  discrepancies  between  the  income  the  appellant
             declared to UKVI with his applications of 12 October 2010  and
             26 March 2013 and the income he declared to HMRC  in  the  tax
             years ending April 2010, 2011 and 2013.

         18.  With respect to the returns for 2010 and  2011,  a  Mr  Jitesh
             Patel FCCA trading as Lloyds Associates accepts that  clerical
             errors were made by members of staff.  The appellant has  said
             that  he  relied  on  Lloyds.   When  he  submitted  his  visa
             extension application on 12 October 2010 he  relied  on  self-
             employed income of �58,251 for the  12  month  period  from  1
             September 2009 to 31 August 2010.  This period  straddled  two
             consecutive tax years namely 2009/2010 and  2010/2011.   While
             they overlap to some extent they are not the same time period.
              The  respondent  does  not  appear  to  have  considered  the
             earnings declared in  the  appellant's  2011/2012  income  tax
             return.  The appellant declared  to  HMRC  income  from  self-
             employment of �6,793 during the period 6 April 2009 - 5  April
             2010 which contrasts with  his  revised  earnings  from  self-
             employment of �33,987 [AB/H11].   The  appellant  declared  to
             HMRC income from self-employment of �8,034 during the period 6
             April 2010 - 5 April 2011 which  contrasts  with  his  revised
             earnings from self-employment of �24,264 [AB/H12].  These  are
             substantial differences.

         19.  I  have  asked  myself  whether  the  appellant's  explanation
             satisfies the minimum level of plausibility.   Notwithstanding
             the substantial differences, I bear in mind that the tax years
             ending April 2010 and 2011 were the first years the  appellant
             worked and submitted tax returns.  An FCCA registered  account
             has claimed responsibility for the  error  [see  paragraph  13
             above].  FCCA registered accountants are subject to a code  of
             ethics and a requirement to act with integrity.  I accept that
             it was  the  appellant's  responsibility  to  check  that  the
             information provided to HMRC was correct, but I do not find it
             unreasonable that having employed and  paid  for  a  qualified
             professional to  assist  him,  he  would  then  rely  on  that
             professional.  HMRC  imposed  no  penalty  on  the  appellant.
             Looking at the evidence in  the  round  I  consider  that  the
             appellant's account of  events  meets  the  minimum  level  of
             plausibility.

         20.  The respondent has not put forward any reason why I should not
             take the letter from the registered FCCA  accountant  at  face
             value.  I find that the respondent  has  not  shown  that  the
             appellant either intentionally deflated the income he declared
             to HMRC in his 2010 and 2011 tax returns in order to evade tax
             or that he intentionally inflated his income for the  purposes
             of his 12 October 2010 visa application  in  order  to  secure
             leave to remain.

         21.  As to the error in the 2012-2013 tax returns, this amounts  to
             expenses being input as �14,586 instead of �4,576.  The effect
             of this is that the appellant has an additional �4,900 odd  to
             pay in tax {AB/F15], which he is paying by instalments.  Again
             those who submitted the appellant's tax return,  Zenith,  have
             taken responsibility.  Although  Zenith  on  their  letterhead
             describes themselves as Accountants and Tax Advisers there  is
             no indication of the professional body to which  they  belong,
             if any.

         22.  I  have  asked  myself  whether  the  appellant's  explanation
             satisfies the minimum level of plausibility.  I bear  in  mind
             that for the tax year ending April 2013 the appellant paid tax
             in excess of �8,500 on the basis of his original return.  This
             is a substantial amount and there is no reason to suppose that
             the appellant would have anticipated that  there  should  have
             been more to  pay.   The  appellant  was  taking  advice  from
             someone  who  held  themselves  out  as  Accountants  and  Tax
             Advisers and they have claimed responsibility  for  the  error
             [see  paragraph  14  above].   I  accept  that  it   was   the
             appellant's  responsibility  to  check  that  the  information
             provided  to  HMRC  was  correct,  but  I  do  not   find   it
             unreasonable that having employed and paid for Accountants and
             Tax Advisers to  assist  him,  he  would  then  rely  on  that
             professional.  HMRC  imposed  no  penalty  on  the  appellant.
             Looking at the evidence in  the  round  I  consider  that  the
             appellant's account of  events  meets  the  minimum  level  of
             plausibility.

         23.  The respondent has not put forward any reason why I should not
             take the letter from Zenith at face value.  I  find  that  the
             respondent  has  now   shown   that   the   appellant   either
             intentionally deflated the income he declared to HMRC  in  his
             2013 tax return in order to evade tax or that he intentionally
             inflated his income for the purposes of his 26 March 2013 visa
             application in order to secure leave to remain.

         24.  Looking at all the evidence in  the  round  I  find  that  the
             respondent has not shown that it is more likely than not  that
             the  appellant  demonstrated  bad  character  either  when  he
             completed his applications of 12 October  2010  and  26  March
             2013 and/or when he submitted his  tax  returns  for  the  tax
             years  ending  April  2010,  2011  and  2013  or  that  it  is
             undesirable for him to be permitted to remain.  I  accept  the
             appellant's explanation of what  occurred  and  that  he  made
             genuine mistakes in his tax returns for the tax  years  ending
             April 2010, 2011 and 2013.

         Paragraph 322(5)

         25.  The  respondent  has  complained  about  under-declaration  of
             genuine earnings for tax to  HMRC  in  the  appellant's  April
             2010, 2011 and 2013 tax returns, or inflated representation of
             income to earn more points and obtain leave to remain  in  his
             12  October  2010  and  26  March  2013   applications.    The
             respondent  considers  this  conduct  sufficient   to   engage
             paragraph 322(5).

         26.  I have found that the respondent cannot show on  balance  that
             the appellant did not make an  inadvertent  mistake.   In  the
             circumstances it follows that paragraph 322(5) does not  apply
             in this case."

         In R (Iran) & Ors, Brooke LJ addressed a number of  questions  that
             had arisen since the jurisdiction of  the  former  Immigration
             Appeal Tribunal was restricted to appeals on point  or  points
             of  law.   At  [11]  and  [12]  under  the  heading  "Part   4
             Perversity, the failure to give reasons  and  proportionality"
             he observed: "11. It may be helpful to comment  quite  briefly
             on three  matters  first  of  all.   It  is  well  known  that
             "perversity" represents a very high hurdle.  In Miftari v SSHD
             [2005] EWCA Civ 481, the whole  court  agreed  that  the  word
             meant what it said: it was a demanding concept.  The  majority
             of the court (Keene and Maurice Kay LJJ) said that it embraced
             decisions  that  were  irrational  or  unreasonable   in   the
             Wednesbury sense (even if there was  no  wilful  or  conscious
             departure from the rational), but it also included  a  finding
             of fact that was wholly unsupported by the evidence,  provided
             always that this was a finding as to a material matter.

         12.  We mention this because far too often  practitioners  use  the
             word  "irrational"  or  "perverse"  when  these  epithets  are
             completely inappropriate.  If  there  is  no  chance  that  an
             appellate tribunal will categorise the matter  of  which  they
             make complaint as irrational  or  perverse,  they  are  simply
             wasting time - and, all too often, the taxpayer's resources  -
             by suggesting that it was."

17. Examination of the judge's reasoning indicates as submitted by Mr Saini
    that all relevant evidence was taken into account by the judge who  was
    clearly alive  to  the  important  points  as  to  the  extent  of  the
    difference in the figures  between  the  original  and  the  corrective
    returns and the timing of the corrective exercise.  There is  no  doubt
    that the judge directed himself correctly as to the issues  and  in  my
    judgment adequate reasons are given why the judge concluded as  he  did
    in [24] and in [26].  As will be seen from the extracts above from  the
    decision, the judge explained  at  [17]  that  he  had  regard  to  the
    guidance in Khan and was clearly alive to the range of  the  discrepant
    figure work: "[18] ... These are substantial differences". What follows
    in [19]  ff  is  detailed  sustainable  reasoning  why  the  judge  was
    nevertheless persuaded as to the appellant's integrity.

18. Given the nature of the challenge, the question is whether a reasonable
    judge, correctly directed, could have come to such a conclusion on  the
    evidence.  It needs to be remembered that the judge heard and  assessed
    the evidence of the appellant and whilst another judge may have come to
    a different legally correct conclusion on the facts it does not  follow
    that this judge reached an irrational  or  unreasonable  decision.  The
    decision was within the range of  rational  findings  on  the  evidence
    which included an acceptance of responsibility  by  Zenith.  It  was  a
    decision that might be surprising to some but,  in  the  light  of  the
    reasons given by the judge, I am satisfied that it  was  not  one  that
    strayed into irrationality. I am not persuaded  that  having  correctly
    directed  himself  the  judge   reached   an   irrational   conclusion.
    Accordingly, on the restricted ground  on  which  permission  has  been
    granted, I am not persuaded that the judge erred in law.   This  appeal
    is dismissed.
