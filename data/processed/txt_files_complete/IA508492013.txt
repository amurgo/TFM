For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 22 July  1971.  His
      appeal against the decision of the respondent dated 14  December  2013
      to refuse his Tier 1 application to vary his leave to remain in the UK
      and to remove him from the UK by way of directions under s.47  of  the
      Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, was dismissed by  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge C M Phillips in a determination promulgated  on  2
      September 2014.


   2. Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds granted the appellant permission to  appeal
      on the basis that it is arguable that it was incumbent on the Judge to
      make  findings  on  the  respondent's  decision  regarding   paragraph
      245DD(h) of the Rules rather than relying solely on the fact that  his
      entrepreneurial team member had withdrawn her appeal.


   3. The appellant had submitted a  joint  application  together  with  Mrs
      Subarna Barua (Team member). At  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal the appellant's representative informed the Tribunal that the
      team member's application had also been refused.


   4. Ms Barua had also sought to appeal but had subsequently withdrawn  her
      appeal in order to lodge  an  application  in  a  different  category,
      namely, as the dependant unmarried partner of another person, not  the
      appellant.


   5. She had not attended  the  appellant's  hearing  to  provide  evidence
      because she had a baby. She had provided a letter dated 1  April  2014
      expressing her support for the appellant's appeal,  and  stating  that
      she wishes to continue her partnership with him. That letter, however,
      was written prior to her appeal (IA/51115/2013) being withdrawn on  11
      June 2014. She was represented by a different  representative  at  the
      time.


   6. The Judge noted that the appellant's representative informed him  that
      he did not have clear instructions from the former partner as  to  her
      position and therefore requested an adjournment  to  proceed  with  an
      appeal on the basis that the appellant was  the  sole  applicant  [6].
      The application was refused as the appeal could be  justly  determined
      without an adjournment to present an application relying on  different
      circumstances [6]. He allowed the representative to take  instructions
      from the  appellant,  after  which  the  representative  informed  the
      Tribunal that she had instructions to proceed  with  the  appeal.  The
      appeal then proceeded [7].


   7. It was submitted before the First-tier Judge  that  this  had  been  a
      joint application and both applications  were  refused  for  the  same
      reasons. In that respect, I  have  been  provided  with  the  decision
      relating to Mrs Barua dated 14 November 2013. It is evident  that  her
      application was refused for the same reasons as the appellant's.


   8. It was submitted on  the  appellant's  behalf  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal  that  the  appellant  is  willing  to  continue   with   his
      application. He has invested half the money and his  partner  has  not
      withdrawn her half. He should thus have the option to  continue  as  a
      Tier 1 entrepreneur migrant. His representative noted at  the  hearing
      before the First-tier Tribunal that  he  had  also  been  refused  for
      failing to provide non-mandatory information and therefore the refusal
      was defective [12].


   9. Judge Phillips found that  the  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his
      application had been  made  and  considered  on  the  basis  that  the
      appellant had a business partner. He no longer has a business  partner
      or entrepreneurial team member after she withdrew her  appeal  against
      the refusal of her application [22].


  10. The issue of his team member was not dealt  with  in  the  appellant's
      witness statement. The appellant asserted in oral  evidence  that  his
      former business partner has had a baby and will no longer be  involved
      in the business but will continue to provide the capital [23].


  11. The Judge found that in the absence of up to  date  evidence  from  Ms
      Barua that post dates the withdrawal of her  "application,"  that  the
      appellant's evidence is not sufficient and '.....does not overcome the
      fact that he is seeking to  change  fundamentally  the  basis  of  his
      application, post decision and for the first time at the appeal' [23].


  12. The appellant had not put forward a claim under Article 8 outside  the
      rules. It was  not  contended  that  he  met  the  requirements  under
      Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE. The Judge found that he had  not  met
      the requirements [24]. The evidence was that he had been in the UK  on
      short term visas from 3 October 2008. He claimed to have made  friends
      and created a social and business circle around himself. He relied  on
      his positive immigration history and the fact that he is  an  educated
      person with no adverse immigration or criminal antecedents [24].


  13. The Judge accepted that he had established  private  life  here  which
      engaged   Article   8.   The   Judge   then   had   regard   to   "the
      balancing/proportionality exercise" that had  to  be  carried  out  in
      accordance with s.117A(3) of the 2014 Borders Act. He directed himself
      in accordance with  authority.  He  also  had  regard  to  the  public
      interest requirements [25-26].


  14. The Judge found that he had not shown any  circumstances  constituting
      compassionate or  compelling  factors  rendering  the  decision  under
      Article 8 disproportionate.


  15. At the hearing on 6 May 2015, Mr Hosein referred to the  approach  and
      findings of the First-tier Judge. He submitted that the  Judge  should
      have dealt with the decision of the respondent based  on  the  reasons
      for refusal rather than on the basis that the  erstwhile  team  member
      had withdrawn her appeal. The Judge had not  considered  the  evidence
      presented by the appellant at the date of hearing. He  submitted  that
      the appellant had submitted a Tier 1 Entrepreneur application together
      with his team  member  at  the  time.  He  has  accordingly  fulfilled
      Appendix A and his business partner confirmed that she is  willing  to
      continue her partnership.


  16. The Judge also failed to consider that the appellant had invested half
      of his funds and after that the Home Office  refused  his  application
      because of the  "genuineness"  (ground  3c).  He  submitted  that  the
      respondent treated the applications  individually  and  made  separate
      refusal decisions.


  17. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Tufan submitted that the team member's
      application had been refused on the same grounds. By  withdrawing  her
      appeal subsequently against that decision,  she  "ipso  facto  doesn't
      challenge the decision."


  18. The finding in respect of the team member was that she had not  raised
      �25,000 from a combination of  her  own  and  her  husband's  savings,
      raising concerns over the genuineness of  the  funds.  The  respondent
      found that she had not genuinely had access to at least �50,000  which
      she intended to invest in her business.


  19. Mr Tufan submitted that the letter relied on by the appellant from  Ms
      Barua was dated 1 April 2014. In that letter she stated that she is  a
      team member of the appellant and that her application was refused  and
      she appealed against the Home  Office  decision.  She  said  that  she
      wanted to continue her partnership with him.


  20. However, that letter was written prior to her withdrawal of the appeal
      on 11 June 2014. The  question  raised  therefore  was  whether,  even
      though the appellant continued his appeal on the basis of  his  access
      to �25,000, he still had access to the rest of  the  money?  Ms  Barua
      however did not deal with the issue raised against her  that  she  did
      not have access to that money and accordingly there was no evidence in
      any event that the appellant had access to the capital required. There
      had been no evidence provided by  the  sponsor  intimating  that  that
      money would continue to be available to him once she had withdrawn her
      appeal.


  21. Accordingly the respondent's findings against her remain unchallenged.
      Even if the Judge had gone into the  substantive  issues,  the  appeal
      could not have succeeded  as  there  had  been  no  challenge  to  the
      respondent's assertion that the team member's funds were not genuinely
      available.


  22. Mr Tufan submitted that there had been no Article 8 submissions.


     Assessment


  23. I have set out Judge Phillips' findings in detail. He found that there
      was no evidence from the appellant's former business partner after the
      date of the withdrawal of her appeal (which occurred in June 2014). It
      was made clear by the appellant's representative before Judge Phillips
      that they did not have clear instructions from  Ms  Barua  as  to  her
      current position.


  24. In the circumstances there was no evidence before the Judge  that  the
      appellant's evidence in itself could lead to  a  conclusion  that  the
      capital was available from Ms Barua to invest in his business.


  25. The Judge was entitled to come to that conclusion based on the lack of
      evidence. There was no  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  Ms  Barua's
      application, namely that the capital was not  genuinely  available  to
      invest in the business.


  26. The appeal was bound to fail on that basis. In those circumstances the
      Judge was not required to make further  findings  as  to  whether  the
      appellant had genuinely established a business.


  27. Although no submissions were made by Mr Hosein relating to the private
      life claim, I note that the grounds of appeal  before  the  First-tier
      tribunal contended that the Judge failed to  consider  the  claim  for
      private life. However, the Judge had regard to the claim under Article
      8 outside the rules and found that he could not meet the  requirements
      of Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE[24].


  28. The Judge had regard to authorities such as Huang and Razgar. He  also
      properly had regard to the provisions of s.117B(1-3) of the 2014  Act.
      Nor had  the  appellant  shown  circumstances  which  were  compelling
      factors   rendering   the   decision   to   refuse   his   application
      disproportionate.


  29. The decision of the Judge was in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
      immigration rules.


           Notice of Decision


          The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not involve  the
making of any               material error on a point of law.  The  decision
shall accordingly stand.


          The appellant's appeal is dismissed.


          No anonymity direction is made.
