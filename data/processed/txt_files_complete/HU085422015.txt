Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss M Chowdhury, Counsel, instructed by Lisa's Law
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I shall refer to  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Therefore, the Entry Clearance  Officer  is  once  more  the
    Respondent and [RH] is the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Colvin (the judge), promulgated on 4 May 2017, in  which
    she allowed the Appellant's appeal.  That appeal had been  against  the
    Respondent's decision of 18  September  2015,  which  had  refused  her
    application of 18 June 2015 seeking entry clearance to join her  mother
    and father in the United Kingdom.

 3. At the time of the  application  the  Appellant's  mother  had  settled
    status in the United Kingdom.  The Appellant's father was in the United
    Kingdom with only limited leave to remain.  The Respondent  decided  to
    consider the application only under paragraph 297  of  the  Rules.   In
    light of this it was said that because of the father's lack of  settled
    status the application could not succeed.  There was no suggestion that
    the mother had sole responsibility for the Appellant and  it  was  said
    that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify granting  entry
    clearance on wider Article 8 grounds.




    The judge's decision

 4. The Appellant and the  Respondent  were  both  represented  before  the
    judge.   At  paragraph  15  of  her  decision  the  judge   notes   the
    Respondent's  representative's  submissions.   It  is  clearly   stated
    therein that Counsel for the Respondent accepted that both parents were
    present and settled in the United Kingdom, that alternatively paragraph
    301(1)(a) of the Rules were met, and also that E-ECC.1.6(a) of Appendix
    FM was met.  In light of the position taken, the judge had  not  called
    upon the Appellant's representative to make submissions.

 5. The judge then goes on to set out her findings  and  conclusions.   She
    notes the Appellant's mother's settled status and then finds  that  the
    Appellant's father had limited leave to remain under Appendix FM as the
    partner of his wife.  This leave ran until the end of 2019.  The  judge
    concluded that the father could be considered present  and  settled  in
    the United Kingdom having regard to the interpretation section  of  the
    Rules.  Alternatively, the judge concludes that the Appellant  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 301.  The judge states that she accepted  the
    Appellant to meet the relationship requirements under the  child  route
    of Appendix FM but did not reach a conclusion on the other requirements
    of this part of the Appendix.  She finishes by purporting to allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.




    The grounds and grant of permission

 6. The Secretary of State's grounds begin by stating that  the  judge  had
    "remitted" the case to the Entry Clearance Officer.  The  grounds  then
    assert that the judge was wrong  in  concluding  that  the  father  was
    present and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.   In  relation  to  the
    paragraph 301 issue the grounds simply  state  that  this  "concerns  a
    separate category of application".  The grounds conclude by  suggesting
    that the judge was wrong to have remitted the matter back to the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to consider the issues of sole responsibility and the
    serious and compelling reasons test.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew on
    1 June 2017.  The grant of permission refers to the paragraph 297 point
    but nothing is said in respect of paragraph 301.




    The hearing before me

 8. At the outset of the hearing I indicated my preliminary  view  on  this
    case, namely that the judge was wrong in respect of  her  consideration
    of paragraph 297, but was entitled to have  considered  that  paragraph
    301 applied and its provisions satisfied.  Mr Nath did not put  forward
    any arguments against this preliminary view.

 9. In all the circumstances I did not consider it necessary to  call  upon
    Miss Chowdhury for submissions.




    Decision on error of law

10. There are no material errors of law in the judge's decision.

11. The judge did err in concluding that the Appellant's father was present
    and settled in the United Kingdom.  Under paragraph 6 of the Rules (the
    interpretation section) there is reference to  the  term  "present  and
    settled".  In the definition of this  phrase,  the  word  "settled"  is
    used.  When one goes back in paragraph 6 to the definition of the  term
    "settled"  it  is  clear  that  the  person  concerned  must  have   no
    restrictions  upon  their  right  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Clearly, the Appellant's father did have restrictions upon  his  leave:
    it was limited in its duration to the end of 2019.  In  light  of  this
    the father was  not  "present  and  settled"  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Therefore, in the light of this particular Appellant's case,  paragraph
    297 could not be satisfied.

12. However, in my view, the judge was fully entitled to go on and consider
    the applicability of paragraph 301 of the Rules. This  is  so  for  the
    following reasons.

13. First, given the father's status at the  time  of  the  application  it
    should have been quite obvious to the Respondent that paragraph 301 had
    potential application whether or not this was  specifically  stated  in
    the application form itself.  It was quite apparent that whilst he  had
    limited leave to remain, the Appellant's  mother  had  settled  status.
    For some reason best known to the  Respondent  paragraph  301  was  not
    considered when the application was refused.

14. Second, I note that in the grounds of appeal against  the  Respondent's
    decision, paragraph 301 is clearly raised.   Notwithstanding  this,  on
    review the Entry Clearance Manager failed to consider this  alternative
    provision.

15. Third, relevant case law confirms that in particular cases a  judge  is
    entitled to look at alternative Rules other than that specifically  put
    forward with the application or considered by the Respondent  at  first
    instance (see SZ (Bangladesh) [2007]  UKAIT  00037  and  CP  (Dominica)
    [2006]  UKAIT  00040).   This  is  a  case  in  which  the  alternative
    provision, namely paragraph  301,  was  obvious  on  the  face  of  the
    undisputed evidence before the judge.

16. Fourth, the Respondent's own representative effectively  conceded  that
    paragraph 301 had application in this case.

17. No other substantive issues under either paragraph 297 or paragraph 301
    had ever been raised by the Respondent,  either  during  the  decision-
    making process or at the hearing before the judge.  In light of this it
    was entirely open to the judge to find that paragraph 301  was  met  in
    full.

18. In light  of  the  above,  the  error  relating  to  paragraph  297  is
    immaterial.

19. The judge purported to allow the appeal under the Rules.  In fact  this
    was and remains an appeal governed by the  amended  provisions  of  the
    2002 Act.  The only ground of appeal available to  the  Appellant  was,
    and is, that the Respondent's refusal of her deemed human rights  claim
    (i.e. the entry clearance application) breached her  Article  8  rights
    and was therefore unlawful under Section 6  of  the  Human  Rights  Act
    1998.

20. In my view, the specific terminology employed by the judge at  the  end
    of her decision is of no material consequence.  She has found,  as  she
    was entitled to, that the Appellant met all of the requirements of  the
    particular Rule.  There has been no suggestion at any  stage  that  the
    Appellant need show anything more than  satisfaction  of  the  relevant
    Rule in order to  succeed  in  her  human  rights  appeal.   The  Rules
    represent policy statements by the Respondent as to where  the  balance
    lies as between the interests of the public on the  one  hand  and  the
    rights of individuals on the other.  In this case the Appellant has met
    all of the requirements of the Rule in question and on that  basis  she
    is able to show that the decision under appeal breached her  Article  8
    rights and is therefore unlawful.

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  a  full  fee
award of �140.00. Although the Appellant has  succeeded  under  a  different
Immigration Rule, the  alternative  provision  was  obvious  from  the  very
start, and the Respondent has failed to engage with it at all.
