                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                   Appellant


                                     and





                                                                  Respondent




                         DETERMINATION  AND REASONS


  1. The Respondent is a citizen  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Yugoslavia
     (Kosovo). The Appellant appeals, with leave, against the  determination
     of an Adjudicator, Ms G Elliman, allowing the Respondent's appeal under
     Article 8 against the decision of the Appellant on 26 May 2001 to issue
     removal directions and refuse asylum. Before us, Ms J  Sigley,  a  Home
     Office Presenting Officer, represented the Appellant and Mr  J  Benson,
     instructed by Messrs Charles Annon & Co,  represented the Respondent.

  2. The Respondent arrived in the UK clandestinely and claimed asylum on 22
     April 2000.  He did not attend his asylum interview and his  claim  was
     rejected. The only issues arising before us, as before the Adjudicator,
     relate to an Article 8 claim arising from his  marriage  to  a  British
     citizen, which the Adjudicator allowed.

  3. The Respondent was married on 4 August 2001, though at the time of  the
     hearing before the Adjudicator on 24 March 2003, they were  not  living
     together and had not been for about six weeks.  She was living with her
     parents and he was living with friends.  This separation was  temporary
     whilst they waited to move into a new house, purchased  by  his  wife's
     parents, where they would live together. His wife  had  a  child  by  a
     previous relationship, who the Respondent cares for as his own.

  4. As the marriage took place after the issue of the  removal  directions,
     the Appellant did not address, in his refusal letter, the  consequences
     of the marriage in the context of Article 8. However the Appellant  was
     represented at the hearing before the Adjudicator and  argued,  amongst
     other things, that it would not be disproportionate for the  Respondent
     to return to Kosovo and to make an application to enter  the  UK  as  a
     spouse in accordance with the Immigrations Rules.

  5. The Adjudicator  accepted  that  there  was  family  life  between  the
     Respondent his wife, and her child and  that  this  had  subsisted  for
     three years. She accepted  further  that  the  interference  caused  by
     removal would be in accordance with the law or  and  that  his  removal
     would be in pursuance of one of the legitimate aims under Article 8(2),
     namely the maintenance of an effective immigration policy. However  the
     Respondent's representative at the hearing argued that return would  be
     disproportionate because there was  no  evidence  that  the  Respondent
     could apply for a visa in Kosovo at all, or that such a visa  could  be
     obtained within a reasonable length of time.  The Adjudicator, with the
     approval of the two representatives,  undertook  research  of  her  own
     after the hearing was over, and  concluded  that  there  were  no  visa
     applications facilities in Kosovo at all and that, although there  were
     facilities in Skopje in  Macedonia,  this  facility  appeared  to  have
     closed in March 2003. She therefore concluded as follows.
           "I  am  left  to  conclude  (in  the  absence  of  any   further
           information on this crucial point) that it would actually appear
           to be physically impossible for the  [Respondent]  to  obtain  a
           visa for entry to the United Kingdom from any Embassy or British
           post in the region."

  6. Accordingly she held that the prolonged absence caused  by  this  would
     disrupt his family life in a way that would be disproportionate.

  7. The grounds of appeal by the Appellant, which  were  amended  with  the
     leave of the Tribunal, attacked this decision on two bases.  The  first
     was that the Adjudicator was wrong to find that  the  Respondent  could
     not obtain a visa within the region. There were at all  material  times
     facilities for obtaining a visa in Skopje, Tirana or Sofia, all  within
     the region and relatively easily accessible  from  Kosovo.  The  second
     basis of the appeal is that the Adjudicator was wrong to conclude  that
     the marriage was subsisting. An Immigration  Officer  had  visited  his
     address of 20 April 2003 and found the Respondent in his bedroom with a
     woman who was not his wife and when asked he was  unable  to  give  the
     address or telephone number of where his wife was.

  8. We first considered whether, in line with the guidance of the Court  of
     Appeal in Oleed, the Adjudicator's assessment of proportionality  under
     Article 8 was either "plainly wrong or unsustainable."

  9. In making our assessment we  have  first  assessed  the  law  and  have
     regard, as invited by both representatives,  to  the  decision  of  the
     Court of Appeal in Amjad Mahmood [2001] INLR 1.  It  undertook  a  very
     thorough review  of  the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  on  the  issue  of
     proportionality. Lord Philips MR summarised the position as follows.
           "I have drawn the following conclusions as to  the  approach  of
           the Commission and the ECHR to the  potential  conflict  between
           the respect for family life and the enforcement  of  immigration
           controls.
           1. A state has a right under international law  to  control  the
              entry of non-nationals into its territory, subject always  to
              its treaty obligations.
           2. Article 8 does not impose on a state any  general  obligation
              to respect the choice of residence of a married couple.
           3. Removal or exclusion of one family member from a state  where
              other members of the family are lawfully  resident  will  not
              necessarily infringe Article 8 rights provided there  are  no
              insurmountable obstacles to the family living together in the
              country of origin of the family members excluded. Even  where
              this involves a degree of hardship for some or all members of
              the family.
           4. Article 8 is likely to be violated  by  the  expulsion  of  a
              member of the family that has  been  long  established  in  a
              state if the circumstances are such that it is not reasonable
              to expect the other members of  the  family  to  follow  that
              member expelled.
           5. Knowledge on the part of  one  spouse  at  the  time  of  the
              marriage  that  rights  of  residence  of  the   other   were
              precarious  militates  against  a  finding  that   an   order
              excluding the latter spouse violates Article 8.
           6. Whether interference with family rights is justified  in  the
              interests of controlling immigration will depend on  (i)  the
              facts of the  particular  case  and  (ii)  the  circumstances
              prevailing in the state whose action is impugned.

 10. He also held in paragraph 65 that;
           65. If and when the  Appellant  applies  for  permission  for  a
           settlement visa in accordance with [the Rules]  his  application
           will have to be considered having regard  to  his  rights  under
           Article 8. In the circumstances  I  do  not  consider  that  the
           possibility that his application may not succeed his any  reason
           for excusing him from the requirement  to  make  an  application
           outside the country if he wishes permission to settle here  with
           his wife and family.

 11. Additionally Laws LJ stated at paragraphs 23 and 26 that
           23. Firm immigration control requires a consistency of treatment
           between one aspiring immigrant and another. If  the  established
           rule is to the effect - as it is - that a person seeking  rights
           of residence here on grounds of marriage, (not being someone who
           already enjoys a leave, albeit limited, to  remain  in  the  UK)
           must obtain an entry clearance in his country of origin, then  a
           waiver of that requirement in the case of someone who has  found
           his way here without an entry clearance and then seeks to remain
           on marriage grounds, having no other legitimate claim to  enter,
           would, in the absence of exceptional  circumstances  to  justify
           the waiver, disrupt  and  undermine  firm  immigration  control,
           because it would be manifestly unfair to other would-be entrants
           who are content to take their place in the entry clearance queue
           in the country of origin.
           26. No matter that the immigrant in the individual case,  having
           arrived here without the required entry clearance, may  be  able
           to show that he would have been entitled to one,  or  even  that
           the Home Office actually accepts that he meets the [Immigration]
           Rules' substantive requirements; it is  simply  unfair  that  he
           should not have to wait in the queue  like  everyone  else.   At
           least it is unfair unless he can  demonstrate  some  exceptional
           circumstances, which reasonably justifies his jumping the queue.



 12. The Court of Appeal in Isiko [2001] Imm AR 291 also concluded that  the
     Respondent was entitled to regard as important  the  integrity  of  the
     immigration regime  as  a  whole,  and  expressly  approved  the  above
     observations by Laws LJ. The Court of Appeal in Soumahoro  [2003]  EWCA
     Civ  840  went  further  and  concluded   that   an   Adjudicator,   in
     circumstances when it is necessary to reach his or her own  conclusions
     on proportionality, (such as in the appeal before us,  where there  are
     new facts that have not been considered by the Appellant) should pay  a
     very considerable deference to the view of  the  Appellant  as  to  the
     importance of maintaining an effective immigration policy.

 13.  The  Tribunal  in  Ahmed  [2002]  UKIAT01757  applying  these  general
     principles, held that it would be proportionate to  remove  an  illegal
     entrant, separated from his UK wife and  British  child  because  queue
     jumping for entry clearance will not be acceptable provided  a  genuine
     application under the Rules from his home country would  not  take  too
     long.

 14. In terms of this appeal, most  of  the  factors  described  in  Mahmood
     apply. The Respondent's immigration status was precarious when  he  was
     married, and both parties to the marriage  would  have  been  aware  of
     this.  The Adjudicator notes the Respondent's wife's evidence that  she
     did not believe she would be able to go to  Kosovo  if  the  Respondent
     returned to live there, because of her daughter's education and her own
     financial obligations in the UK.   The  Adjudicator  did  not  actually
     consider whether there is any insuperable obstacle to return,  but  the
     evidence does not suggest that there is, though plainly the wife  would
     not wish to live in Kosovo and it would be difficult for  her  and  her
     daughter to do so. The Respondent has not been in the UK for long.

 15. Ms Sigley then produced various papers to us, showing how Kosovans  can
     make visa applications for the UK, it being conceded that there are  no
     visa application facilities  available  in  Kosovo  itself.  There  are
     issuing  posts  in  Skopje,  Tirana  and  Sofia,  all  in  neighbouring
     countries in the region.  The most  obvious  to  use  for  Kosovans  is
     Skopje, which is only a short journey of one  and  a  half  hours  from
     Pristina by road. Initial applications can be made by  letter,  but  an
     applicant will  have  to  attend  an  interview,  following  which  the
     decision is usually made. An applicant would need a travel document  to
     travel to Skopje but  not  a  visa.  FRY  passports  are  available  in
     Pristina or alternatively UNMIK  travel  documents  can  also  be  made
     available to Kosovo residents.  Ms Sigley  argued  therefore  that  the
     Adjudicator was plainly wrong to conclude that there  were  no  readily
     available visa facilities for the Respondent  in  his  region  and  was
     therefore also wrong to allow the Article 8 appeal.

 16. The first issue argued before  us  was  a  dispute  over  the  evidence
     concerning the availability of visa facilities in  Skopje.   Ms  Sigley
     informed us that her inquiries at the Home Office  had  indicated  that
     there was a visa office in Skopje and always had been. She  produced  a
     document from the British Embassy in Skopje obtained on 1/8/03  stating
     that the visa section was available on the fifth floor of the  Embassy.
     New applications were accepted between 8:00-9:30 on Monday to Thursday,
     effective from 8 July 2003. Applications could be made in  a  drop  box
     through a courier, a representative or in person. A CIPU bulletin of 17
     December 2001 also confirmed that visas were then available in the ways
     described above.

 17. Mr Benson on the other hand produced a very brief  document,  which  he
     said he had obtained in a search on the  Internet,  also  on  1  August
     2003. It is dated 20 March 2003. It states that
           "The visa section at the British Embassy in Skopje closed on  20
           March 2003.  Skopje also handles applications for Pristina.   It
           is hoped that this will be a temporary measure and the situation
           will be reviewed on 26 March."

 18. Mr Benson asked as to conclude that there  was  a  serious  issue  over
     whether visas could be processed at the Embassy in Skopje.  We  do  not
     agree.  All the evidence taken together, shows that  visa  applications
     for Britain from Macedonia and Pristina are handled in the  Embassy  in
     Skopje and have been at all material times, as Ms Sigley was  informed.
     At the most, the section was closed in March, as  a  temporary  measure
     and re-opened. There were new opening hours effective from  early  July
     2003.  We have therefore assessed this appeal on  the  basis  that  the
     Respondent would have to make his application, not from within  Kosovo,
     but through the Embassy at Skopje, which  is  1�  hours  by  road  from
     Pristina. He could also choose  to  make  his  application,  if  he  so
     wished, via the UK Embassies in Tirana and Sofia, but the journey there
     would be somewhat longer.

 19. Mr Benson then argued that in Mahmood, Laws  LJ  in  paragraph  23  had
     referred to making visa applications from a country of origin, and that
     his  comments  therefore  did  not  apply  where  there  were  no  visa
     facilities within the country of origin.  We do not agree.  In  context
     it is clear that Laws LJ was not being prescriptive in his comments but
     was indicating that anyone from a particular  country  should  have  to
     undergo the same procedures as others from  that  country.   Of  course
     there  may  be  circumstances  in  which  there  may   be   exceptional
     difficulties in requiring an individual  to  seek  a  visa  in  another
     country. These would plainly have to be taken into account on the facts
     of any particular appeal. But, we conclude that  the  broad  principles
     described  in  Mahmood  are  equally  applicable   whether   the   visa
     application can be made and processed from within the  applicant's  own
     country or, within a reasonable time, from another country nearby.   As
     the Tribunal is well aware, there are a  number  of  countries  in  the
     world where there are no visa processing  applications  but  facilities
     are made to their nationals in our Embassies in neighbouring countries.
     However, to distinguish these countries, as such, from countries  where
     there are UK visa application facilities as Mr Benson has urged,  would
     make no real sense.  The journey across a large country to the  British
     Embassy in the capital many miles away  may  be  more  complicated  and
     difficult than travelling a few miles across the border to our  Embassy
     in a neighbouring country. We conclude that when a journey  to  another
     country is required in order to make a visa application, that does  not
     itself render the need for such an  application  disproportionate,  but
     each claim must be assessed on it own facts, in case there are specific
     problems or obstacles in travelling to the other country.

 20. Mr Benson then argued that the Respondent was an exceptional  case.  He
     would need to apply for a passport  or  an  UNMIK  travel  document  to
     travel to Macedonia.  We are not impressed by  this  argument,  as  the
     Respondent will have to obtain a passport to receive his visa to travel
     to the UK, should his application be successful, as would  anyone  else
     from Kosovo, seeking to enter the UK  legally.  There  is  no  evidence
     before us that this process  will  cause  undue  delay.  Passports  are
     readily available in Pristina, and indeed may be available in the UK if
     the Respondent applies before returning. The Respondent can  start  his
     visa application process off before he obtains his passport. We can see
     no good reason on the evidence  before  us  why  the  need  to  have  a
     passport before travelling to the UK, which is required of  all  lawful
     immigrants to this country, should  present  any  undue  difficulty  or
     delay for the Respondent. With such a passport the Respondent will  not
     face any difficulties from the border guards Macedonia.  A  journey  of
     about 1�  hours by road in his home region is not unduly  excessive  to
     expect of a person who wishes to travel to the UK, and has already done
     so once, albeit illegally. Nor for that matter would it   be  excessive
     if he had to travel to Tirana or Sofia for this purpose

 21. We therefore conclude, on the facts of this appeal, that  there  is  no
     good reason why the Respondent cannot  return  to  Kosovo  and  make  a
     lawful application to enter the UK in accordance  with  the  facilities
     available in his region, or that  requiring  him  to  do  so  would  be
     disproportionate. We further  conclude,  for  all  the  reasons  stated
     above, that the Adjudicator was plainly wrong to allow his appeal under
     Article 8 and that the decision, which is unsustainable,  must  be  set
     aside.

 22. There is then the second ground of appeal.  Ms  Sigley  indicated  that
     this would not be relevant if she succeeded on the first ground, and Mr
     Benson did not dissent from this.  We agree. The Adjudicator  concluded
     that the Respondent had a subsisting marriage  and  would  be  able  to
     succeed in his marriage application.  That may well be true.  Certainly
     the Respondent and his wife attended the hearing before us as a  couple
     and produced statements to the effect that  their  marriage  subsisted.
     On the other hand the report from the Immigration Officer, to which  we
     have referred above, offers some evidence to the contrary.

 23. However we do not consider it is  for  us  to  decide  this  issue  for
     ourselves, either under the Immigration Rules or under  Article  8.  No
     application under the Rules has yet been made for leave to enter  as  a
     spouse.  Still less has any decision been made by  an  Entry  Clearance
     Officer in Skopje or elsewhere, who is, as we  are,  required  to  take
     into account an applicant's human rights.  If we were to go on and deal
     with this issue ourselves, we would in effect be assuming, without  any
     good reason, that in such cases an Entry Clearance Officer will make  a
     decision that is not in accordance with the law. His decision  will  be
     subject to a right appeal in the usual way.

 24. The Tribunal addressed a similar  point  in  its  starred  decision  in
     Chawish [2002] UKIAT 01376. In that case the  Applicant,  a  Kurd  from
     Iraq, was a beneficiary of an undertaking not to  remove  him  until  a
     safe means of returning him to the KAA could be found. He  argued  that
     if he remained in the UK without any immigration  status  he  would  be
     destitute and this would be in violation of his Article 3  rights.  The
     Tribunal held that
           "It would be unlawful for the Secretary of State to act in  such
           a way as to breach the claimant's human rights or  indeed  those
           of anyone seeking to enter or to remain in United  Kingdom.   If
           he did act in such a way, a legal challenge could be brought and
           the decision would be overturned.  The  law  does  not  tolerate
           anyone being left destitute as a  number  of  decisions  of  the
           Court of Appeal have made clear."

 25. This in our view is the correct approach. We should  not  prejudge  the
     Entry Clearance Officer's decision, and we should not  assume  that  an
     Entry Clearance  Officer  would  breach  Article  8  when  making  that
     decision.

 26. For the reasons given above this appeal is allowed,  the  Adjudicator's
     decision to allow the appeal under Article 8  is  set  aside,  and  the
     Appellant's original decision is upheld.
