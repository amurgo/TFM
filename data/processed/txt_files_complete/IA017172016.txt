Representation:

For the Appellant:              Mr R Rashid (counsel) instructed by Verax,
solicitors
For the Respondent:           Ms R Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Thorne promulgated on 1  August  2017,  which  dismissed  the
Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 17 November 1981 and is a national of  Vietnam.
The appellant applied for leave to remain  in  the  UK  on  article  8  ECHR
grounds (both family and private life). On 14 March 2016  the  Secretary  of
State refused the Appellant's application.


The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Thorne ("the Judge") dismissed the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 28 March 2018 Upper  Tribunal
Judge Gleeson gave permission to appeal stating

      1. The appellant seeks permission to appeal against a decision of  the
      First-tier Tribunal (Manchester hearing centre). The  appellant  is  a
      citizen of Vietnam, who appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  against
      the respondent's decision to refuse him leave to remain in the  United
      Kingdom with his wife, a British citizen, on private and  family  life
      grounds under article 8 ECHR.


      2. The First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.  The
      appellant challenges that decision on the basis  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal erred in law in treating his stay in the  United  Kingdom  as
      precarious, applying Rhuppiah  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  home
      Department [2016] EWCA Civ 803 at [43]. As both a house and a business
      owner in the United Kingdom, the  appellant  submits  that  there  are
      circumstances of a special and compelling character for which he ought
      to have been given leave to remain. He considers that the Judge failed
      to apply paragraph 276ADE properly or at all  to  the  facts  of  this
      appeal.


      3. The grounds are arguable. Permission to appeal is granted.

The Hearing

5. (a) Mr Rashid, for the appellant, moved the grounds of  appeal.  He  took
me to [44] of the decision and told me that the  Judge's  findings  of  fact
are contained there. He relied on paragraphs 44 and 53 of  Rhuppiah  v  SSHD
[2016] EWCA Civ 803. He told me that although the  Judge  made  findings  of
fact which favour the appellant, the Judge failed to factor  those  findings
of fact probably into his proportionality assessment,  and  that  the  Judge
failed to follow the  guidance  given  in  Rhuppiah  when  he  came  to  the
conclusion,  at  [44(v)],  that  the  appellant's  immigration  status   was
precarious.

(b) Mr Rashid told me that the Judge  does  not  give  adequate  reasons  to
support his proportionality assessment. He told me that the  appellant  owns
a house and a business and that between 2012  and  2015  the  appellant  had
leave to remain in the UK as the spouse of a British  citizen.  He  referred
me to Onwuje [2018] EWCA Civ 331 and told  me  that  the  appellant  enjoyed
article 8 private life which the Judge not  fully  appreciate.  He  told  me
that the Judge's findings at [44] are not properly reasoned.

(c) Mr Rashid told  me  that  the  decision  is  inadequately  reasoned  and
contains material errors of law. He urged me to set the decision aside.

6. (a) Ms Petterson, for the respondent, told me that the decision does  not
contain errors, material or otherwise. She told the Judge  was  fully  aware
that the appellant had previously been granted leave  to  remain,  and  that
the Judge made a clear finding that the appellants  marriage  is  no  longer
subsisting. She told me that the Judge's findings are  consistent  with  the
guidance in Rhuppiah because the appellant did not have indefinite leave  to
remain at the time of application. The appellant was therefore  not  settled
in the UK so that his immigration status must be precarious.

(b) Ms Petterson turned to the appellant's private life  and  told  me  that
having a business & a  home  in  the  UK  is  not  sufficient  to  create  a
compelling characteristic of private life. She  told  me  that  the  Judge's
focus at [44(iii)] was on section 117B of the  2002  Act,  and  reminded  me
that at [44(vii)] the  Judge  finds  that  the  appellant's  family  are  in
Vietnam and that the appellant can realises his assets in  the  UK  to  help
relocate to Vietnam.

(c) Ms Petterson told me that  the  Judge's  proportionality  assessment  is
more than adequate and  that  the  Judge  took  all  relevant  factors  into
account before reaching a conclusion which was  well  within  the  range  of
reasonable conclusions available to the Judge. She urged me to  dismiss  the
appeal and allow the decision to stand.

Analysis

7.    In Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803 it was held that where Parliament  had
itself declared, such as in section 117B(1) - (3),  that  something  was  in
the public interest, that was definitive. The words in section 117A(2)  that
regard must be had to the considerations listed  in  section  117B  did  not
mean  that  courts  had  a  discretion.  However,  having  regard  to   such
considerations did not mandate a particular outcome in a balancing  exercise
under Article 8 of the ECHR.

8. In Onwuje v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 331, the  Court  of  Appeal  looked  at
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in  the  context  of  a
Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and although the  appeal  was  dismissed,  the
court confirmed that running a business may amount to private life  for  the
purposes of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

9. In Rhuppiah [2016]  EWCA  Civ  803  it  was  held  that  the  concept  of
precariousness in immigration status in section 117B(5)  was  distinct  from
the concept of unlawful presence in the UK in subsection (4).  Even  if  the
two concepts could be said to overlap, subsection (5) would be redundant  if
they were the same. The concept of precariousness extended more  widely,  to
include people who had leave to enter or remain which  was  qualified  to  a
degree such that they knew from the outset that their permission  to  be  in
the UK could be described as precarious. The extension and  re-extension  of
limited leave to remain did not mean that the person's status was not  still
precarious. In the context of section 117B, the relevance of  precariousness
of immigration status was the effect it had  on  the  extent  of  protection
which should be afforded to private life for the purposes of the  Article  8
proportionality balancing exercise. The more that  an  immigrant  should  be
taken to have understood that his or her time in the host country  would  be
comparatively short or would be liable to termination,  the  more  the  host
State was able to say  that  a  fair  balance  between  the  rights  of  the
individual and the general public interest in the firm and fair  enforcement
of immigration controls should come down  in  favour  of  removal  when  the
leave expired.

10. In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) the Tribunal  held  that  a
person's immigration status is "precarious" if their continued presence  in
the UK will be dependent upon their obtaining a further grant of leave;

11. The appellant's application was an application for leave  to  remain  as
the spouse of a person present and settled in the UK. It  is  common  ground
that the appellant was granted leave to remain as the spouse  from  7  March
2013 to 7 March 2015. The appellant's application for  indefinite  leave  to
remain as a spouse was submitted on 4 March  2015.  The  changes  to  appeal
rights brought in by the  2014  came  into  effect  on  6  April  2015.  The
transitional provisions preserved full of appeal for this appellant.

12. At 24 the Judge says

      The only ground of appeal is human rights. However, I must  also  look
      at the human rights appeal through the prism of the immigration  rules
      and do so below.

13. The Judge  is  wrong.  The  appellant  has  a  valid  appeal  under  the
immigration rules. In any event, having resolved to consider article 8  ECHR
grounds of appeal in the light of the immigration rules, the Judge does  not
do so.

14. The Judge says that he starts his findings at [23] of the decision,  but
does not. [24] to [31] is nothing more than guidance taken in law. There  is
nothing in those paragraphs which contains a finding  of  fact  relevant  to
this appeal. Between [34] and [43] the Judge continues to seek  guidance  in
law and does not make  findings  of  fact.  There  is  however  one  crucial
finding of fact at [33], and that is  that  the  appellant  has  established
article 8 private life in the UK.

15. To an extent those errors may be academic  because  of  the  passage  of
time. The appellant's application was made on the basis  that  he  continued
to live with his wife. The respondent's decision was made on the basis  that
the appellant is no longer a party to a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage,
and the appellant used fraud to obtain an English-language certificate.

16. At [15] the Judge records that the appellant concedes that  he  and  his
wife have lived apart since 2013. The skeleton  argument  produced  for  the
appellant makes it clear that the appellant hopes  for  reconciliation,  but
five years have now passed and reconciliation  has  not  been  achieved.  At
[33] the Judge finds that article 8 family life  does  not  exist  for  this
appellant. At [44 (iv)] the Judge finds that the appellant had not  employed
deception to obtain an English language certificate.

17. No submissions were made to me in relation to the immigration  rules  or
to article 8 family life. The focus in this case has quite  clearly  shifted
to private life. It is argued that the existence of a home and  business  in
the UK are important elements of private life. The Judge finds that  article
8 private life is established. The real problem with the  decision  is  that
the proportionality assessment is carried out in a staccato  style  at  [44]
of the decision.

18. Hesham Ali (Iraq)  v SSHD   [2016] UKSC 60 recommends  a  balance  sheet
approach to article 8 assessment. At [44] there  is  every  likelihood  that
the Judge had s.117B of the 2002 Act in mind,  but  he  has  restricted  his
assessment of proportionality to section 117B factors.  The  Judge  has  not
addressed paragraph 276 ADE of the immigration rules.

19 .     The net effect is that the Judge's  proportionality  assessment  is
inadequate. The proportionality assessment is the central  feature  of  this
case, so that the error is clearly a  material  error  of  law.  I  set  the
decision aside. There is sufficient material  before  me  to  enable  me  to
substitute my own decision.

My Findings of Fact

20. The appellant is a Vietnamese national. He entered the UK in 2009  as  a
student. He has leave to remain as a student until 31st of May 2012.

21. On 6 September 2011 the appellant applied for leave to remain in the  UK
as the spouse of a British citizen. The respondent refused that  application
on 24 October 2011. On 29 May  2012  the  appellant  applied  for  leave  to
remain in the UK as the spouse of a British citizen.  That  application  was
successful and he was granted leave to remain from 7 March 2013 to  7  March
2015.

22. On 4 March 2015 the appellant submitted an  application  for  indefinite
leave to remain on the basis  of  his  marriage  to  a  person  present  and
settled in the UK. The respondent  refused  that  application  on  14  March
2016. It is against that decision that the appellant appeals.

23. The appellant and his wife  have  lived  in  separate  households  since
2013. The appellant still  seeks  reconciliation  with  his  wife,  but  his
efforts have been unsuccessful. The respondent invited the appellant's  wife
to attend marriage interviews on two  separate  occasions.  The  appellant's
wife has not attended a marriage interview & has  not  cooperated  with  the
application. In January 2015 the appellant passed the ESOL English  language
test. The appellant has taken and passed the life in the UK test.

24. The appellant owns the house in which he lives in the UK  and  owns  and
operates a business in the UK from which he  earns  more  than  �19,000  per
annum.

The Immigration Rules

25. The appellant cannot meet the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules
because he does not live with his wife. Because he does not  live  with  his
wife he  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  287(a)(ii)  of  the
immigration rules. Even though the appellant  demonstrates  that  he  has  a
valid English-language certificate and has passed the knowledge of  life  in
the UK test, he cannot get past paragraph 287(a)(ii) of the rules.

26. Because of his age and the length of time that the appellant  has  lived
in the UK the appellant cannot meet the requirements of  paragraph  276  ADE
of the immigration rules. It has never  been  argued  that  there  are  very
significant obstacles to the appellant's reintegration to Vietnam.

Article 8 ECHR

27. The appellant has lived in the  UK  since  2009.  The  Judge  found  the
private life is established. It is not disputed that the appellant owns  his
home in the UK, and that the appellant derives his income  in  the  UK  from
his business. It is not disputed that the appellant earns more than  �19,000
from his business. The private life in  the  appellant  has  established  is
made up of his home, his business, his income. No reliable evidence  of  the
circle of friends or contribution to society is placed before  me,  but  the
appellant has been here since 2009 both as a student and as  a  businessman.
Those aspects of private life are, at the very least, implied.

28.  s.117B of the 2002Act says

      Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases


      (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
      interest.


      (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak
      English, because persons who can speak English-


           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


      (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
      independent, because such persons-


           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and


           (b) are better able to integrate into society.


      (4) Little weight should be given to-


           (a) a private life, or


           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


      that is established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the
      United Kingdom unlawfully.


      (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by  a
      person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.


      (6) In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
      public interest does not require the person's removal where-


           (a)  the  person  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
           relationship with a qualifying child, and


           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the
           United Kingdom.

29.    In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) the Tribunal  held  that
an appellant can obtain no positive right to a grant  of  leave  to  remain
from either s117B (2) or  (3),  whatever  the  degree  of  his  fluency  in
English, or the strength of his financial resources. In Forman  (ss  117A-C
considerations) [2015] UKUT  00412  (IAC)  it  was  held  that  the  public
interest in firm immigration control is not diluted  by  the  consideration
that a person pursuing a claim under Article 8 ECHR has at no time  been  a
financial burden on the state or is self-sufficient or is likely to  remain
so indefinitely.  The significance of these factors is that where they  are
not present the public interest is fortified.

30.  Immigration control is in the public interest. The  effect  of  removal
is that the appellant will be deprived of contact  to  his  estranged  wife.
The appellant will have to sell his home. He will either sell  or  lose  his
business and he will lose his  source  of  income.  Against  those  negative
aspects of removal, the appellant will be able to  sell  his  home  and  his
business, take the money realised back to Vietnam  with  him  and  use  that
money to re-establish himself.

31. In Onwuje v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 331, the  Court  of  Appeal  ultimately
concluded that removal would  not  be  disproportionate.  It  was,  however,
accepted that "an entrepreneur's ownership of, and involvement  in,  his  or
her business may also be regarded as an aspect of  their  private  life  for
the purpose of Article 8", as stated in Niemietz v Germany (1993)  16  EHRR
97.

32. What is argued for the appellant before me is one aspect  of  life.  The
appellant's home and his business are dominant aspects of his private  life,
but they do not automatically outweigh the public  interest  in  immigration
control. The appellant is a healthy 36-year-old  who  has  demonstrated  his
ability to work hard to establish a business. He can take the fruits of  his
labours back to Vietnam with him, where his parents and siblings  live.  All
the decision spells for this appellant is the upheaval of relocation.

33. On the facts as I find them to be, the upheaval of relocation  does  not
amount to a disproportionate breach to the  right  to  respect  for  private
life. When the process of relocation is complete  the  appellant  will  have
lost little, if anything. He will be able to realise his assets  in  the  UK
and take them with him to Vietnam.

34. The appellant cannot succeed on  article  8  ECHR  grounds  because  the
decision is not a disproportionate interference with his private  life.  His
separated from his wife, so that article 8 Family life is not established.

Decision

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 1 August 2017  is
tainted by material errors of law and is set aside.

36. I substitute my own decision

37. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules

38. The appeal is dismissed on article 8 ECHR grounds.
