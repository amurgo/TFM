                                   Between

                                FAHEEM HASAN
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. For reasons set out in a decision  promulgated  on  27th  September
         2018 I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal judge Frankish
         who had dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision  by  an
         entry clearance officer to refuse to grant him an  extended  family
         member residence permit.

      2. I gave leave to the appellant to file and serve  further  documents
         and for both parties to make submissions.  After  some  delay,  the
         appellant, through his solicitors  served  documents  on  which  he
         sought to rely.

      3. In a letter dated 5th December 20018, Mr McVeety on behalf  of  the
         respondent, confirmed that having  reviewed  the  documents  relied
         upon by the appellant, he had no further submissions  to  make  and
         the appeal of the appellant was no longer opposed.

      4. In the light of this, I allow the appellant's  appeal  against  the
         decision of the respondent refusing him an extended  family  member
         permit.

         Conclusions:

         The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve
         the making of an error on a point of law.

         I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

         I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
