For the Respondent:    Mr P Durm, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Somalia, born in  January  1955.   On  9
    October 2015 she made an application to enter  the  United  Kingdom  to
    join her children, in particular
         NA.


2.   The focus of the application was that  NA,  born  4th  July  2001,  had
    special needs and would require her mother, the  appellant,  to  assist
    her with those.

3.    Entry clearance was refused in the decision of  28  October  2015,  on
    the basis that the appellant failed to meet the Immigration  Rules  and
    in particular failed to satisfy the requirements for accommodation  and
    maintenance and indeed had not passed an English language test.  It was
    also considered that there was nothing that was exceptional outside  of
    the Rules such as to require entry clearance.

4.   The matter came for hearing before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lawrence
    on 13 October 2017.  In a decision dated 25 October 2017 the appeal was
    dismissed.

5.   Challenge has been made to this decision.  Firstly on the  basis  of  a
    failure to take the best  interests  of  the  child  into  account  and
    secondly,  failure  to   take   into   account   whether   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles for family life  between  the  child  and  the
    mother taking place in Somalia or other country.  It was on  the  basis
    of the second ground that leave to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    granted.  Thus the matter comes before me to determine that issue.

6.   The appeal was predicated on the basis that there were six children  of
    the appellant in the United Kingdom, four of them British citizens.  Mr
    Hersi however clarified before me that in fact there were four who were
    British citizens and two who  were  not  British  citizens  and  living
    elsewhere.

7.   By way of background the children became separated from  the  appellant
    in the course of the troubles in 2002.  Fadumo, aged 38,  had  come  to
    the United Kingdom at an early stage and acquired settled status.

8.   In 2002 NA and Rahma had been left with their brother, Mahad. In  2009,
    both were sponsored by Mahad to enter the United Kingdom under  refugee
    family reunion provisions.  Mahad is  now  married  with  a  child  and
    seemingly NA (aged 17) lives with Fadumo, who has indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

9.   NA is partially sighted  and  it  is  said  suffers  from  longstanding
    learning difficulties.  There is very little by way of  medical  detail
    about those matters but they were analysed with great care by the Judge
    in the decision.  She attends or attended the school for the  partially
    sighted.  There is a letter from the Joseph Clarke School  speaking  of
    the fact that NA's special educational needs relate to her severe sight
    impairment, as a result of which she is performing significantly  below
    aged-related expectations.  Thus it would  seem  that  the  educational
    needs are not  related  to  her  intellect  but  rather  to  her  sight
    difficulties which make her slow  to  absorb  information.   She  needs
    significant adult support.  It was the conclusion  of  the  Immigration
    Judge that such support was being received by her and  Section  55  was
    looked at in detail.

10.  As indicated, she had entered the United Kingdom in 2009 and  has  been
    living with her siblings and attending school.  Her welfare  and  other
    safeguarding issues have been well taken  care  of  and  she  has  been
    nurtured and looked after by her family since arriving in the UK.

11.  It is the case for the appellant that in 2015 she became reunited  with
    her children and communicates with them over the internet and by  other
    means of communication.

12.  The manner in which the application  was  initially  presented  to  the
    Entry Clearance Officer, and indeed the way in which, seemingly, it was
    presented at the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  is
    illustrated by the skeleton argument that  was  then  presented  by  Mr
    Amunwa dated 13 October 2017. Submissions were made on the  basis  that
    NA was  a  child  who  was  vulnerable,  who  needed  her  mother,  the
    appellant, and that it was in her best interests  that  her  mother  be
    allowed her to come to the United Kingdom.

13.  It was the conclusion, however, of the Judge that NA was not  neglected
    nor abused nor had any unmet needs.  Although  understandably  she  was
    wanting to see her mother, she had no particular needs that required to
    be met by her mother that were not met already.

14.  It was the finding of the  Judge,  having  considered  the  Immigration
    Rules, that the appellant did not meet the  language  requirements  nor
    accommodation, nor the maintenance requirements.  The  judge,  however,
    considered that in terms of those matters,  particularly  in  terms  of
    accommodation and maintenance, there could be future  improvement  such
    as to support a possible new application.

15.  The Judge did not find there to be otherwise any compelling or  serious
    circumstances to disapply the requirements of the Immigration Rules and
    found nothing of a compelling nature to  be  considered  outside  those
    Rules so to meet Article 8 ECHR.

16.  The burden as I said of  the  skeleton  argument  was  to  address  the
    Immigration Rules to contend that in the circumstances  they  had  been
    met and that the needs of NA were compelling  such  as  to  permit  the
    appeal to be allowed.

17.  In terms of the challenge relating to the best interests of  NA,  I  do
    not find there to be any substance to that matter.  It  is  clear  that
    the Judge gave the most anxious consideration to it.

18.  Mr Hersi, in his submissions, contends that the  decision  is,  however
    defective in that it has failed to consider  human  rights  and  family
    life in a more holistic context.

19.  The focus as I indicated was in relation to the ability of the  sponsor
    to meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.   There  are  two
    bundles of documents which were presented on behalf of  the  appellant.
    The first bundle contains essentially a number  of  witness  statements
    together with bank records and the reports in connection with NA.   The
    second bundle consists almost exclusively of  financial  documents  and
    bank statements.

20.  In the bundle is a witness statement from the appellant,  undated.   It
    sets out her situation and circumstances.  It makes it  clear  that  in
    2015 she applied for a settlement visa as  a  parent  of  her  youngest
    child, NA.

21.  The appellant was born in Kismayo, Somalia in 1955.   She  was  married
    and had eight children.  Sadly two of those children are now  deceased.
    The family suffered at the hands of militia men in Somalia  because  of
    the civil war.  Her family and herself are members of  the  Reer  Hamar
    minority clan.  She was forced to flee  from  her  home  in  Marka  and
    states that she is now living in Uganda.  Her  husband  was  killed  in
    Marka. NA and Rahma were looked after by  Majad  as  from  that  point,
    living with him and his family

22.  Between 2002 and 2010 the appellant went to Kismayo to  stay  with  her
    mother's relative and then returned to Marka.  She had to  leave  there
    because of Al Shabaab.  In 2014 she left Somalia and went to live  with
    her second nephew in Uganda.

23.  In 2015 she heard of the children and was delighted to make  connection
    with them.

24.  The statement concludes that she wants to come to  the  United  Kingdom
    to be with NA and help with her upbringing because she  is  her  mother
    and NA needs her.  She was upset at being away from  her  children  and
    speaks to NA and Fadumo every day by  telephone,  Viber  and  WhatsApp.
    The appellant gives very little detail  about  her  own  situation  and
    circumstances in Uganda or  details  any  compelling  reasons  why  she
    should come to the United Kingdom otherwise than be with several of her
    children.

25.  Considerable reliance is placed upon the decision  in  MM  [2017]  UKSC
    10.

26.  In essence that was a  decision  considering  the  requirement  that  a
    sponsoring partner should have  a  gross  annual  income  of  at  least
    ï¿½18,600.  It was the contention that such was unreasonable and unlawful
    as a condition for family unity.  Generally the decision of the Supreme
    Court was that that was a proper requirement to be imposed.  There  was
    a recognition, however, in the course of the judgment that  in  certain
    circumstances such an approach should not be  slavishly  followed.   It
    was to be recognised  that  the  Rules  will  not  always  cover  every
    situation and circumstance in which a person may have a valid claim  to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom as a result of his or her Article
    8 rights.

26.  That matter was highlighted particularly  having  regard  to  the  pre-
    entry language requirement and to the decision in  BB  [2015]  UKSC  68
    granting an express exemption where there are exceptional circumstances
    which prevent the appellant from being able to meet that requirement.

27.  The facts of SS were also considered in the decision at  paragraph  35.
    SS was a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo  resident  in  the
    United Kingdom with British citizenship.  Her husband sought to  enter.
    That was refused on the basis that the requirement of MIR was not  met.
    A slightly more flexible approach however was  taken  by  the  Tribunal
    recognising that joint income would meet the  requirement,  recognising
    also that there was a real need for SS following a  miscarriage  to  be
    supported and helped by her husband but that family life could not take
    place otherwise than in the United Kingdom.

28.  The case of Jeunesse v The Netherlands [2015]  60  EHRR  789  was  also
    cited with approval.  The ultimate issue was whether a fair balance has
    been struck between individual and public interest, taking into account
    the various factors identified.

29.  In paragraph 93 reference is made to MM in these terms:-

         "We have described the restrictions in the  rules  on  taking  into
         account prospective earnings of the foreign partner, or  guarantees
         of third party support.  The most striking example,  in  the  cases
         before us, is found in that of MM and his wife.  On the face of  it
         there is a strong case on the merits for admitting her consistently
         with the general objectives of the new Rules.  The couple  have  no
         realistic prospect of living together  in  any  other  country  and
         although his earnings on their own are  below  the  MIR  she  is  a
         pharmacist with good prospects of finding skilled  employment  here
         and they have apparently credible promises of  support  from  other
         family members.  They are unlikely to be a burden on the  state  or
         unable due to lack of  resources  to  integrate.   Yet  the  strict
         application of the Rules will exclude them."

30.  Once again, in paragraph 104, taking the factors  in  Jeunesse,  family
    life would effectively be seriously ruptured, because they could  spend
    only short periods of time together. While both spouses originated from
    the DRC, the sponsor has  been  in  the  UK  for  many  years  and  was
    naturalised as a citizen as long ago as 2006. He also has two  children
    who are British citizens so his ties UK were extensive.  The First-tier
    Tribunal found that there are insurmountable obstacles in  the  way  of
    their living in DRC, there are no factors  of  immigration  control  or
    public order weighing in favour of exclusion. Although it was  a  post-
    flight relationship, formed  when  there  was  no  guarantee  that  the
    applicant would be admitted, it began in 2010  before  the  Rules  were
    changed when the  sponsor  would  easily  have  met  the  old  adequate
    maintenance test.

31.  In case  before  me,  family  life  with  the  appellant  was  somewhat
    limited, there having been many years of complete separation  from  the
    family  and  contact  had  only  recently  begun  again  in  2015  with
    communication between mother and children.  No  significant  aspect  of
    dependency was raised other than the claim made by the  appellant  that
    there was a dependency by NA upon her, which was not accepted upon  the
    finding of the  Judge.   There  was  very  little  about  the  personal
    circumstances of the appellant as to whether she needed the support  of
    her children or whether there was an emotional dependency by  her  upon
    her children.  There was little about  her  living  conditions  or  her
    needs, so as to consider  those  matters  in  the  overall  balance  of
    fairness and proportionality to determine whether it would be right  in
    all the circumstances to exclude her from her  family  and  the  United
    Kingdom.  The evidence of the appellant was that she  was  living  with
    other relatives in Uganda.  It seems to me to be unduly wide to seek to
    apply the reasoning of MM  that simply because a  parent  is  separated
    from their children should entitle them to come to the  United  Kingdom
    notwithstanding that the Rules are not met.

32.  As I have indicated, the very burden of the  submissions  made  in  the
    course of the appeal was that  the  Rules  were  met,  subject  to  the
    question of the language certificate, alternatively that the health and
    wellbeing of NA were the compelling reasons otherwise  to  grant  entry
    clearance.  The Judge for sustainable reasons found that the Rules were
    not met and that the  compelling  circumstances  as  advanced  did  not
    exist.

33.  It seems to me that a Judge is required to determine  the  issues  that
    are presented rather than  to  widen  the  scope  of  consideration  to
    matters that were not specifically raised.  It was not a case that  the
    Judge considered that the appellant would be  permanent  excluded  from
    the United  Kingdom,  rather  that  there  was  some  prospect  of  the
    requisite conditions being met in time.  The grounds  of  appeal  which
    lay before the Tribunal Judge  was  that  the  appellant  met  all  the
    requirements of the applicable Rule for access to  the  child  and  had
    provided sufficient evidence in respect of those matters, alternatively
    that in the event the decision was not proportionate and  breached  the
    appellant and her  child's  human  rights.   This  is  a  very  focused
    application and received as I so find a  proper  and  focused  response
    which found nothing  of  a  compelling  nature  that  would  justify  a
    departure from the Rules.  I find the Judge was entirely  justified  in
    coming to that conclusion.  The wish to be with  her  children  without
    more does not, it seems to me, such  a  circumstance  as  to  permit  a
    departure from the Rule.

Notice of Decision

34.  In the circumstances I do not find there to be any  material  error  of
    law in  the  decision.   This  appeal  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge shall  stand,
    namely that the appeal in respect  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  of
    Article 8 stands dismissed.

35.  No anonymity direction is made.
