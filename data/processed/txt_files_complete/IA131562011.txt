                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant Kiirya Fredrick Lubega date of birth 14th March 1980 is a
    citizen of Uganda. This is his  appeal  against  the  determination  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC promulgated 14.06.2011.  The
    First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal against  the
    Respondent's refusal to vary his leave to remain and his Article 8 ECHR
    claim. At the original hearing before Judge Jones QC, it  was  conceded
    by those representing the Appellant that he could not  succeed  in  his
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and therefore what was  left  before
    the First-tier Judge was an Article 8 ECHR claim only.

Background

 2. Following Judge Jones's decision the Appellant, who at  that  time  was
    represented by Charles Annon Solicitors, sought permission  to  appeal.
    The grounds seeking permission relied upon the claim that the Judge had
    erred in giving insufficient consideration to the rights of the  child;
    whom it was claimed would be able to register as a British  citizen  as
    the Appellant's child's mother (also from Uganda) had indefinite  leave
    to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  when  the  child  was  born.  The
    Appellant's claim is based on his relationship with the child's mother.
    He claims to be in a family relationship with her and their child.

 3. It was also submitted that insufficient consideration had been given to
    the Appellant's private life - the Appellant  having  been  in  the  UK
    since 2001 when he entered as a student.

 4. Judge Easterman in a fully  reasoned  decision  refused  permission  to
    appeal. The Appellant then renewed the  application  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal. Permission was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Jordan  on  31st
    August 2011 and the relevant parts of the grant reads as follows: -

         "(1)  I am not sure whether the Immigration Judge  found  that  the
              appellant's girl-friend was settled in the United Kingdom and
              had received indefinite leave to remain.

          (2)  There is a difference between being a United Kingdom  citizen
              and being entitled to apply for  United  Kingdom  citizenship
              but it would have been helpful to  know  if  the  Immigration
              Judge found  the  appellant's  son  was  entitled  to  United
              Kingdom citizenship.

          (3)     Whilst the Immigration Judge  refers  to  no  'undesirable
              difficulties' for the son to settle in Uganda,  the  test  is
              whether it is reasonable for him and  his  mother  to  do  so
              which the Immigration Judge does not address.

          (4)     Although the Immigration Judge categorises  the  appellant
              as one who has been in  the  United  Kingdom  illegally,  the
              respondent herself does not appear to have  taken  that  view
              since she granted him leave to remain as a Tier  4  (General)
              Student until November 2010 (as well as  2008-2099).  If  the
              Secretary of State does not take the point,  it  is  arguable
              the Immigration Judge should not have done so.

          (5)     If the reality of this appeal is that the appellant has  a
              right to enter the United Kingdom under the Immigration Rules
              in one capacity or another  on  the  basis  of  a  subsisting
              relationship with the mother of  his  child,  it  would  have
              useful (sic) to know that since this is bound to be  material
              for Article 8 purposes, Chikwamba".

 5. Following that grant  of  permission  directions  were  issued  on  3rd
    November 2011. Those directions stated that the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision would be set aside  and  that  the  appeal  would  accordingly
    proceed to a hearing for the purpose of considering  evidence  relevant
    to the remaking of the decision.

 6. The matter was then set down for hearing on  various  dates  throughout
    2012, but the appeal did not proceed  to  a  hearing  throughout  2012,
    because  the  Respondent  had  started  to  make  enquiries  about  the
    immigration status of the Appellant's girlfriend. This of course  could
    impact upon the immigration status of their child.

 7. Finally the matter was set down as a resumed hearing before me  on  9th
    May 2013. Notices of the hearing were served at  the  Appellant's  last
    notified address and also upon his representatives Charles Annon &  Co.
    Notices for the hearing were sent out on 18th April 2013.

 8. The Appellant attended the hearing accompanied by  his  girlfriend  and
    their child. No representative attended. Miss  Kiss  attended  for  the
    Respondent.

Preliminary Issue

 9.  The  Appellant  applied  for  an  adjournment  of  the  hearing.   His
    application was on this basis. He stated that  his  representative  was
    not in attendance and he wished for them to attend. He claimed that  he
    had not received a copy of the hearing notice. He said that he had been
    living at 276 Worton Road but had changed address at the end of  March.
    This was due to the property at Worton Road suffering some damage which
    required building work.

10. Clearly the Appellant had received some notice of the  hearing  because
    he was there in attendance.  His  representatives  had  certainly  been
    informed of the hearing. He also  confirmed  that  his  representatives
    knew of the hearing today and proceeded to show  me  a  letter  on  his
    mobile phone (a copy of which is in  the  file  dated  9th  May  2013),
    briefly stating that an adjournment was sought. That letter was  sparse
    in content.

11. I made further enquiry of the Appellant and asked why he had  not  kept
    in touch with his  representatives  since  the  Tribunal  file  clearly
    showed that on 21st March  2013  his  representatives  had  attended  a
    directions hearing and would have been well  aware  from  that  hearing
    that the case was to be set down for a full hearing. I also  asked  the
    Appellant how he knew about today's hearing. He conceded that  some  of
    his post did get through to his  new  address,  but  then  changed  his
    application to say he had been in touch  with  his  representative  and
    that they wanted �300 off him to attend the hearing today. He said that
    he had not enough time to gather the money so was  now  asking  for  an
    adjournment to give him time to get the funds.

12. I enquired where the money was  to  come  from  for  these  funds.  The
    Appellant said that his brother would give him the money but could give
    no indication of how long it would be before any money was available.

13. I concluded that if I were to adjourn there was no  realistic  prospect
    that the Appellant would be able to access sufficient  funds  within  a
    reasonable timeframe. This case has been going on  for  a  considerable
    period of time. As the  Appellant  had  not  been  able  to  accumulate
    sufficient funds to pay for his representation by this time, I  saw  no
    evidence that he would be able to do  so  within  the  near  future.  I
    therefore declined to adjourn the matter and informed the  Appellant  I
    would proceed with the hearing and  take  evidence  from  him  and  his
    witness, his girlfriend Hadija Kayuki.

14. I confirm that I had all the documents before me which were before  the
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge.  Importantly  those  documents  included  a
    witness statement of the Appellant dated 6th June 2011  and  one  dated
    21st June 20011 (sic). In addition further documents had been put in by
    Miss Kiss  relating  to  interviews  and  applications  concerning  the
    Appellant's girlfriend Hadija Kayuki. Copies  of  those  documents  had
    been properly served upon the Appellant's representatives.

15. I hereby record that I was unable to locate a manuscript  statement  of
    the Appellant's girlfriend which is referred to in the determination of
    Judge Jones QC. I took full oral evidence from her however.

16. The Appellant Frederick Lubega told me that his current address  is  29
    Reynolds Road UB4 9BX. This is the address of his  brother.  He  relied
    upon two witness statements which in summary states that he entered the
    United Kingdom first on 9th August 2001  with  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student until 9th August 2004. He is a Ugandan national. He states that
    he lost his passport in 2001 and applied to  the  Ugandan  Embassy  but
    they took a long time to give him a new passport.

17. He states that he was a student at London  Southbank  University  until
    9th August 2004. There is a gap then in his immigration history. He was
    however later granted leave to remain as a student between 6th  October
    2008 to 31st October 2009. There is then a further gap  before  he  was
    granted leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  until  3rd
    November 2010.

18. The Appellant claims that some time in 2004 he met his girlfriend,  now
    his fianc�e Hadija. On 1st March 2007 a son was born  of  their  union,
    the child's name is Caius.

19. The Appellant said that his child's mother is  his  girlfriend  at  the
    moment and that he lives with her sometimes but accepted  that  he  was
    not working or studying at present. She and the child are reliant  upon
    public funds.

20. He told me that he does voluntary work for the church that  he  belongs
    to and said he sees his son every day.

21. He claimed that he had adapted to life here in the UK and would like to
    stay. He agreed that his father is still living in Uganda  although  he
    has a brother in the UK.

22. Miss Kiss then asked the Appellant questions. He was asked why when his
    leave to remain had finished in 2004 he had overstayed? He  replied  it
    was because his passport had got lost. He  was  then  referred  to  his
    application for leave to remain which was dated November 2010.  It  was
    put to him that he had failed to disclose on that application  form  as
    he was required to do so, that  he  had  a  conviction  for  fraud.  It
    transpired that he had been convicted of fraud  in  2008  when  he  had
    fraudulently used his brother's passport in order to obtain employment.
    He agreed that he had been convicted of fraud. His explanation was that
    he wanted to earn money to help support his girlfriend  and  child.  He
    gave no explanation for omitting to leave  out  those  details  on  the
    leave to remain application form.

23. The Appellant stated that his relationship with his girlfriend  started
    in 2004 but in 2007 when she was pregnant with the  child;  he  stopped
    living with her.

24. He was then referred to an  application  made  by  him  in  2008.  That
    application makes no mention of his being the father of his  child.  It
    gives an address of 38A High Street Richmond and claims  on  that  form
    that he had no partner or child. He responded to this by saying that he
    had given all the information to whoever had filled in the form and  he
    had just signed it without reading it.  He  then  blamed  the  lack  of
    correct information being given on the fact that  his  representatives'
    offices were in Kent and he could not  travel  there  due  to  lack  of
    funds.

25. When asked if he was supporting his girlfriend and son financially,  he
    said that he did help if he could afford to. He works sometimes but his
    girlfriend is in receipt of public benefits.

26. He was then asked about the various addresses at  which  he  had  lived
    over the period of years since his entry  to  the  United  Kingdom  and
    about the various addresses at which his girlfriend had lived.  He  was
    asked if he was claiming that since 2004 he  had  been  in  a  constant
    relationship with his girlfriend. He replied in the affirmative. He was
    then referred to an interview record of a UKBA interview conducted with
    his girlfriend dated 20th March 2012.  Questions  from  that  interview
    were put to him by Miss Kiss. Question 16  and  21  of  that  interview
    record are as follows: -

    Question:     Where you living together at the time Caius was born?

    Answer:  We were on and off he was there when he was born.  After  some
             time he left, I thought he had returned to Uganda  and  I  was
             with friends.

    Question: When did you last live together?

    Answer:  Before the end of 2006 when I was pregnant.

    The Appellant was asked  if  he  could  explain  this  discrepancy.  He
    responded by    saying that he did not  know  and  "she  will  have  to
    explain that".

27. He was asked what care he gave to his son. He replied that he took  him
    to school and to football on Saturdays. The Appellant said that he  has
    a brother in the UK (the  same  person  whose  passport  the  Appellant
    fraudulently used to obtain work) and that his girlfriend  also  has  a
    brother in the UK.

28. He was then asked what he knew about  his  girlfriend's  past.  He  was
    asked did he know that she had used different names since her entry  to
    the United Kingdom. He said that he got to know this. She had  come  to
    the United Kingdom in 1999 when she was young. She had left  the  house
    of the people who had brought her because her step-mother expected  her
    to wash cook and clean for all the family.

29. When asked what would happen to  her  if  he  returned  to  Uganda,  he
    claimed that she would be devastated because he is with  her  everyday.
    It was put to him that his girlfriend is also a  Ugandan  national  and
    she could return with him and the child. He responded by saying she has
    adapted to life in the UK and it is harder to get work in  Uganda,  the
    job opportunities are better here. That concluded his evidence.

30. I next heard from Hadija Namata Kayuki. She  gave  an  address  of  104
    Woodlands Garden Isleworth. She stated  that  she  had  moved  to  that
    address two months ago because 276 Worton Road is being  repaired.  She
    said she moved out of Worton Road in late March. Miss  Kiss  asked  her
    various questions.

31. She was asked about the interview that was conducted by UKBA  regarding
    her immigration status. She was asked how old she was when she  entered
    the United Kingdom and she replied that she was 16. It was put  to  her
    that in her Home Office interview she had said she  was  13  and  in  a
    subsequent police interview had claimed she entered the United  Kingdom
    aged 15. Which was  correct?  She  responded  by  saying  she  did  not
    remember.

32. She was asked when she had first entered into a relationship  with  the
    Appellant. She said she thought it was 2003 but did  not  remember  the
    date. She said they started living together in 2004 but stopped in 2006
    before her son was born. After that, she said, she  and  the  appellant
    were living together "on and off". She thought that when the  Appellant
    had left her in 2006, he had returned to  Uganda.  She  said  that  she
    started seeing him again because she wanted her son to know his father.
    She said both she and the Appellant spoke Ugandan and that her son also
    understands Ugandan when spoken to, although he will answer in English.
    She knew that the Appellant has family in Uganda because she has  heard
    him calling and speaking to his father on the phone. She said  she  did
    not wish to return to Uganda. She wanted her son to be  brought  up  in
    the UK. She accepted that her status here  is  questionable,  but  said
    that she got Job Seekers Allowance. She accepted  that  she  had  given
    evidence on the Appellant's behalf before the First-tier Tribunal.  (As
    can be seen from the papers, she was investigated  by  UKBA  about  her
    status and identity which she had used when first entering the  UK.  It
    would appear that she entered the United Kingdom as the dependant child
    of someone  who  was  not  her  biological  father.  She  used  various
    aliases).

33. Miss Kiss asked her about the evidence she had given before the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.  She was referred to question 32 of her  interview
    of 20th March 2012 when she was asked what name she had used  when  she
    signed her witness statement. She  responded  that  she  had  used  the
    "Hadija" identity. She was then asked if she  had  disclosed  her  true
    name and details in relation to Mr Lubega's appeal. She replied she had
    not. When asked why not she replied to Miss Kiss,

    "I explained to his Barrister my names and she said  no  need  to  make
    mention of all that"

     Miss Kiss then put it to her, "You lied to the Court didn't you?"

    She replied to Miss Kiss "To me it is not lying. I am not lying to  the
    Court. I didn't think the Court should know the whole truth".

34. That concluded her evidence.

Consideration of the Evidence and Findings

35. In making my decision I have taken into account in this appeal, as I am
    tasked to do, the family and private life of the Appellant. As  in  any
    Article 8 ECHR claim, regard must be had to the principles as  set  out
    in Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.  The  issue  in  this  appeal  is  one  of
    proportionality.

36.  Since  most  of  what  the  Appellant  claims  revolves   around   his
    relationship with his partner and their child, I take into account  the
    principles set out in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC  4,  Beoku  Betts,  E-A
    (Article 8 - Best interests of child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00315.

37. Concerning the familiar five questions which any decision maker  should
    pose in relation to Article 8 and which are contained in Razgar,  I  am
    also aware that the determination of any Article 8 appeal must  involve
    the decision maker striking a balance between the  family  and  private
    life of the Appellant and  the  interference  it  may  suffer  and  the
    interests of the wider community.  I  accept  that  the  Appellant  has
    demonstrated that he has family life  in  the  United  Kingdom  at  the
    present time with his partner and child and as I indicated  earlier  in
    this determination the issue is one of proportionality.

38. I start my consideration from the point of evaluating the  evidence  of
    the Appellant. I regret to say that on the  core  issue,  I  found  the
    Appellant to be lacking in credibility. I say this  for  the  following
    reasons. The main  plank  of  the  Appellant's  case,  is  his  claimed
    relationship with his partner and child. When asked how deep or  strong
    this tie was, his response amounted to,

         "I live with her sometimes"..."I would like to stay  here  with  my
         son and girlfriend - I have adapted to life here".

    The Appellant then gave a series of different addresses to those  where
    his girlfriend lived. He said he lived with his brother. He  said  that
    he saw his son every day. It is hard to reconcile that  statement  with
    the fact that he only lives with his girlfriend "on and off".

39. Against the Appellant is the fact that in 2004 he was an overstayer and
    during that time he started a  relationship  with  his  girlfriend.  He
    stopped living with her by all accounts, whilst she was  pregnant  with
    her son. When he applied for leave to remain in 2008 made no mention of
    his girlfriend and son on his application form.  His  only  explanation
    for that omission was to blame the person who filled  in  the  form.  I
    conclude that certainly during the early years of the child's life, the
    Appellant simply wasn't  around.  This  belief  is  reinforced  by  the
    child's first school record, which records that they had no  record  of
    the Appellant being the child's father. The most telling  part  of  his
    claimed relationship with his girlfriend is that he was unaware of  the
    fact that she had taken an alias and that her status in the  UK  is  in
    doubt. He only found this out at a later stage in their relationship.

40. The Appellant is  no  stranger  to  fraud.  He  fraudulently  used  his
    brother's passport in order to obtain work. This was another fact  that
    he failed to disclose in an application for leave to remain.

41. He told me that he does voluntary work for his church  and  I  have  no
    reason to doubt that. He explained that his father  remains  in  Uganda
    and that if he  had  to  return  to  Uganda  his  girlfriend  would  be
    devastated.

42. When asked why he and his partner could not return to  Uganda  together
    (since she is a Ugandan citizen as well)  he  responded  that  the  job
    opportunities here are better and that it is harder to get work  there.
    In fact he was unable to outline any prospects of work in the UK.  When
    asked by Miss Kiss  if  he  was  saying  that  he  was  in  a  constant
    relationship with his partner he replied in  the  affirmative.  However
    when it was pointed out to him that his  girlfriend  in  interview  had
    responded that they last lived together before the end of 2006 when she
    fell pregnant. She also said that they were living together on and  off
    when the child was born. Could he comment on that?  His  only  response
    was "I don't know, she will have to explain that".

43. Piecing all this evidence together, I am led to the conclusion  that  I
    can  place  little  reliance  upon  the   Appellant's   assertion   his
    relationship with his girlfriend and son is as deep and durable  as  he
    would have me believe.

44. The evidence of his girlfriend did not assist him. She was  asked  when
    she had first entered into a relationship  with  him  and  she  vaguely
    thought it was in 2003 but could not remember the date. She stated that
    they had lived together in 2004 but stopped doing so in 2006 before the
    child was born. She then described their living  together  as  "on  and
    off". In fact in 2006 when they stopped living together, she said,  she
    thought the Appellant had returned to Uganda so clearly there was not a
    great deal of communication between the Appellant and his girlfriend at
    that time. The Appellant in fact had not returned to Uganda but this is
    illustrative of the precarious nature of their relationship.

45. When asked why she had resumed her relationship with the Appellant, she
    replied that she wanted her son to know his  father.  That  is  to  her
    credit.

46. She accepted that she is Ugandan and that her status in the UK  is  now
    in doubt. She was asked why she could not return  to  Uganda  with  the
    Appellant and their son. Her response to this was that her life is here
    and she is on Job Seekers Allowance.

47. When asked at what age she was when she had first come  to  the  United
    Kingdom she was unable to give a straight response. In response to Miss
    Kiss she said she was 16 years of age; at an earlier interview she  had
    said 13 years and in the police investigation  concerning  her  status,
    she said 15 years. That further discredits her evidence.

48. There was nothing put forward of substance to show why she  should  not
    return to Uganda other than that  she  preferred  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

49. In the context of this evidence what of the Appellant's child?  Firstly
    he was born in the United Kingdom and has lived all his life  here.  He
    is now 6 years of age and has started school. He lives with his  mother
    who is his primary carer and by all accounts there are no concerns  for
    his general health and well-being.

50. The child is not a British citizen and his mother's status in the UK is
    uncertain. She remains a Ugandan  citizen.  The  child's  father  is  a
    Ugandan citizen. The child therefore is also a Ugandan citizen.

51. In normal circumstances I accept that it is in the best interests of  a
    child to live with and be brought up with both  parents.  This  is  far
    from the case here. By all accounts from the child's early  years,  the
    Appellant simply was not around; even  though  he  was  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

52. In 2008 he did not acknowledge the child and his girlfriend when making
    application for further leave to remain. I am told that he  lives  with
    the child's mother "on  and  off".  This  comes  from  the  Appellant's
    girlfriend. He certainly  does  not  share  the  same  address  as  his
    girlfriend. He openly states that his current address and residence  is
    with his brother.

53. His contact with his child is limited. He says he taken him  to  school
    every day (that I do not accept) and  plays  football  with  him  on  a
    Saturday. It does not strike me that the Appellant can be  said  to  be
    part of the family unit - far from it.

54. Added to this there is nothing that I have heard which  would  show  it
    would be unreasonable for the child and the child's mother to  relocate
    to Uganda with the Appellant. They are all Ugandan citizens.  There  is
    nothing to prevent  the  Appellant's  girlfriend  and  the  child  from
    visiting the Appellant in Uganda. They would be entitled to entry.

55. I bear in mind that the Appellant, his girlfriend and their  child  are
    in receipt of public funds in the United Kingdom. There is  nothing  to
    show why it would be unreasonable for them to return to Uganda.

56. Set against the somewhat weak arguments for the Appellant remaining  in
    this country under the provisions of Article 8, there is also the  need
    of the United Kingdom government to maintain  immigration  control.  He
    has used deceit to obtain work in the United  Kingdom  and  this  is  a
    factor which I cannot ignore in carrying  out  the  balancing  exercise
    under Article 8.

57. In the light of the observations and  findings  that  I  have  set  out
    above, I have concluded that to refuse this Appellant leave  to  remain
    would not constitute a disproportionate interference with the family or
    private life rights of him or any member of his family. In making  that
    decision I record  that  I  have  had  regard  to  the  rights  of  the
    Appellant's girlfriend and child  but  neither  those  rights  nor  the
    Appellant's own outweigh the public interest which lies in the  refusal
    of this Article 8 claim.

DECISION

58. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Jones QC contained  an  error
    of law. I hereby remake the decision.
