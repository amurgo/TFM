                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly. This order applies to, amongst others, all parties.

Any failure to comply with this order could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings.

Decision and reasons

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal refusing his entry clearance application  for  settlement
    as a minor with his mother in the United Kingdom, the application being
    made on human rights grounds.  The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan
    born on 6 December 2003 and is 15 years old.

Background

 2. The appellant was born in 2003 from the marriage  of  his  mother  (the
    sponsor) to her first husband.  The appellant's application  says  that
    the sponsor's marriage broke down before his birth and in 2005, when he
    was 2 years  old,  the  appellant  began  to  live  with  his  maternal
    grandmother in Pakistan.

 3. In 2006, when the appellant was 3 years old, the sponsor  went  to  the
    United Kingdom, leaving the appellant in the care of  his  grandmother.
    The grandmother in her witness statement records that the sponsor asked
    her to 'assume the responsibility of the child' but  that  the  sponsor
    always had the intention to take the  child  with  her  to  the  United
    Kingdom as soon as she was in a position to do so.

 4. The sponsor's evidence to the First-tier Tribunal  was  that  in  2006,
    following guardianship proceedings, the grandmother was  appointed  the
    appellant's guardian.  In fact, the Upper Tribunal having now seen  the
    guardianship order, that happened 6 years later, in 2012.

 5. The sponsor met her second husband soon  after  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom and remarried in May 2008.  In her second marriage, the sponsor
    has two much younger children, a girl aged 9 and a boy whose age is not
    given.  They are said to be sad that their half  brother  has  not  yet
    been able to join them in the United Kingdom.   The  appellant's  step-
    father is supportive, referring to  the  appellant  as  'our  son'  and
    saying how distressed the sponsor is that he has not been granted entry
    clearance.

 6. On 14 June 2012, following Court proceedings in the Lahore courts,  his
    grandmother was appointed the appellant's guardian.  I have been  given
    a copy of the guardianship proceedings  with  an  English  translation,
    sealed by the Court.   The guardianship order records that it  was  the
    grandmother who filed the petition, that the petition was advertised to
    the public at large in a newspaper.  Nobody objected.  The  grandmother
    gave a surety of 2,00,000 (two Lakhs Rupees) and undertook to stand  as
    the appellant's guardian under the Guardians and Wards Act  1890  (VIII
    of 1890).

 7. At the hearing, the appellant's father appeared in person and  recorded
    his statement that  he  had  no  objection  to  the  grandmother  being
    appointed his son's guardian and that 'he does not have  any  objection
    if petitioner and real mother  of  the  minor  [the  sponsor  in  these
    proceedings]  would  take  the  minor  to  abroad'.   The   grandmother
    undertook not to take the appellant  beyond  the  jurisdiction  of  the
    Court in  Lahore  without  prior  permission,  'except  for  occasional
    visits' and to keep the Court informed of any change of address for the
    minor.

 8. The appellant last saw his mother in 2016,  according  to  the  refusal
    letter.  She also visited in 2013/2014.  He has friends in Pakistan and
    has lived there all of his life, for most of it with his grandmother.

Entry clearance decision

 9. The respondent refused entry clearance on the basis  that  the  sponsor
    had not demonstrated that she had sole responsibility for the appellant
    (sub-paragraph E-ECC.1.6), and further, that the financial requirements
    were not met (E-ECC.2.1).  The sponsor had not shown that having regard
    to the sources of income specified in E-ECC.2.2, she had the  specified
    gross income of at least �22400 per year.

10. The respondent considered whether pursuant to  paragraphs  GEN.3.1  and
    GEN.3.2  there  were   serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
    considerations which made exclusion of this child  undesirable,  taking
    into account his  best  interests  as  a  primary  consideration.   any
    compelling compassionate circumstances but concluded  that  there  were
    none.

11. The application was refused under paragraph D-ECC.1.2  of  Appendix  FM
    with reference to paragraph EC-C.1.1(d) and that the appellant did  not
    qualify for entry clearance on the 5-year child route or  the  10-child
    route on the basis of exceptional circumstances.

12. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

13. The First-tier Judge was  not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  had  sole
    responsibility for the appellant, or that  the  financial  requirements
    were met.   He  did  not  accept  that  the  sponsor  was  guiding  the
    grandmother, nor that  there  was  any  convincing  evidence  that  the
    grandmother would  be  unable  to  continue  to  perform  her  role  as
    guardian.  The First-tier Judge found it not  plausible  that  all  the
    decisions as to the appellant's care were made by the sponsor  who  was
    nearly 4000 miles away.

14. He considered that the sponsor had decided that  the  appellant's  best
    interests lay in his remaining in Pakistan with  his  grandmother,  and
    noted that the appellant had friends in Pakistan.  He accepted that the
    sponsor and her two children  in  the  second  marriage  could  not  be
    expected to return to Pakistan and live there with him.

15. The First-tier Judge said that the figures for income provided  by  the
    sponsor and her second husband were vague and 'seemed to be subject  to
    variation since most of their income was  from  self-employment'.   The
    First-tier  Judge  did  not  make  any  finding  whether   the   income
    requirements were met, on the evidence before him.

16. The First-tier Judge dismissed the appeal.  The appellant  appealed  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

17. The grounds of appeal focused on the  First-tier  Judge's  findings  on
    sole responsibility and on the appellant's Article 8  ECHR  family  and
    private life rights to have family reunion with his  mother  and  half-
    siblings, 'who evidently were eagerly waiting for  [his]  inclusion  in
    the family'. There was evidence of electronic communication between the
    sponsor and appellant.

18. There was no challenge to First-tier Judge's rather obscure findings on
    the parties' financial position, save to  note  that  the  sponsor  had
    provided over 8 years  of  financial  remittance  evidence,  which  was
    undisputed.

19. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the First-tier Judge
    had  erred  in  his  finding  that  the  sponsor  did  not  have   sole
    responsibility and in his overall assessment of the appeal by reference
    to Article 8 ECHR.  In particular, it was  arguable  that  the  Judge's
    findings and reasons were inadequately  reasoned  and  failed  to  take
    account of the best interests of the child appellant.

Rule 24 Reply

20. There was no Rule 24 Reply by the respondent.

21. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

22. At the hearing, I heard oral  submissions  from  both  representatives,
    which I have taken into account in  reaching  my  decision.   Mr  Tufan
    noted that the decision had been made under the wrong paragraph of  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), under Appendix FM  EC-C,  rather
    than paragraph 297.  That was significant as the  income  figure  which
    appears in Appendix FM is not specified in paragraph 297.

Analysis

23. As Mr Tufan accepted, the correct paragraph of  the  Immigration  Rules
    for this application was 297(i)(e):

         "297.    The requirements to be met by a person seeking  indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for  settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:

             (i)  is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a  parent,
             parents or a relative in one of the  following  circumstances:
             ...

                  (e)  one parent is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                  Kingdom  or  being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
                  settlement and has had sole responsibility for the child's
                  upbringing; or ...

             (ii) is under the age of 18; and ...

             (v)  can, and will, be maintained adequately  by  the  parent,
             parents, or relative the child is  seeking  to  join,  without
             recourse to public funds; ...."

24. The evidence before me shows that the  sponsor  and  her  husband  have
    maintained their United Kingdom family without recourse to public funds
    and have maintained the appellant in Pakistan, paying what is  required
    for him.  They do not need to show that they have �22400 income and the
    respondent has not taken the opportunity which Rule 24 provides to give
    reasons why the income they do have will not be sufficient to  maintain
    the enlarged family adequately.

25. There remains the question of sole responsibility.  I  have  regard  to
    the terms of the guardianship order.  It is clear that the  appellant's
    natural father has renounced any parental responsibility and is content
    for his former wife and mother-in-law to take  responsibility  for  the
    appellant.  I place weight  on  the  grandmother's  evidence  that  the
    sponsor always intended to take the appellant  to  the  United  Kingdom
    with her when she could and that he is now in his late teens,  and  his
    grandmother wishes to go and live with other relatives, who do not wish
    to accommodate the  appellant.   It  is  right  that  there  is  little
    evidence of her health problems, but there is no reason not  to  accept
    her statement of her future plans.

26. I also have regard to the very detailed supervision of the  appellant's
    schooling and external activities revealed by the emails in the  First-
    tier Tribunal bundle and the Upper Tribunal bundle.

27. The guidance given in TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e):  "sole  responsibility")
    Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049 that

         "Sole responsibility" is a factual matter to be  decided  upon  all
         the evidence. Where one parent  is  not  involved  in  the  child's
         upbringing  because  he  (or  she)  had  abandoned   or   abdicated
         responsibility, the issue may arise between  the  remaining  parent
         and others who have day-to-day care of the child abroad.  The  test
         is whether the parent has continuing control and direction over the
         child's upbringing, including making all the important decisions in
         the child's life. However, where both parents  are  involved  in  a
         child's upbringing, it will be exceptional that one  of  them  will
         have "sole responsibility".

28. At [52] in TD, the Upper Tribunal held that it is always a question  of
    fact who is exercising responsibility for  the  child  and  that  "that
    responsibility may have been for a short duration in that  the  present
    arrangements may have begun quite  recently'.   Responsibility  may  be
    shared between different individuals, where the  only  parent  involved
    lives in the United Kingdom.

29. The crucial element of the TD guidance is at [52] sub-paragraphs (vi) -
    (ix):

         "vi. However, the issue of sole responsibility is not just a matter
         between the parents. So even if there is only one  parent  involved
         in  the  child's  upbringing,  that  parent  may  not   have   sole
         responsibility.

         vii.   In   the   circumstances   likely   to   arise,   day-to-day
         responsibility (or decision-making) for  the  child's  welfare  may
         necessarily be shared with others (such as  relatives  or  friends)
         because of the  geographical  separation  between  the  parent  and
         child.

         viii.    That, however, does not prevent  the  parent  having  sole
         responsibility within the meaning of the Rules.

         ix.   The  test  is,  not  whether  anyone  else   has   day-to-day
         responsibility, but whether the parent has continuing  control  and
         direction of  the  child's  upbringing  including  making  all  the
         important decisions in the child's life. If not, responsibility  is
         shared and so not "sole"."

30. The  evidence  in  this  appeal  is  quite  clear,  that  although  the
    grandmother has day-to-day responsibility for this  child,  at  present
    his mother makes  all  the  important  decisions  in  his  life.  I  am
    satisfied that the sponsor has  sole  responsibility  and  accordingly,
    this appeal falls to be allowed.

DECISION

31. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision  by  allowing
    the appeal.
