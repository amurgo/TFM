                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellant against a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Tipping) who by a determination promulgated on 6th June 2013  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
    refuse to vary his leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  and  to
    remove him under s.47 of the Immigration, Nationality  and  Asylum  Act
    2006.

 2. When granting permission to appeal First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Frankish
    did not deal with the question of timeliness as he was required to  do.
    The time for seeking permission to appeal expired on 17th June but  the
    application was not received by the Tribunal until 2nd July.

 3. In Samir (First-tier Tribunal permission to appeal :time)  [2013]  UKUT
    00003 (IAC) it was made clear that in such circumstances the  grant  of
    permission is a conditional grant and that I as a  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge must first decide whether to admit the application.

 4. The application explains that the Appellant is paying privately for the
    appeal proceedings and took time to raise funds and as soon as  he  did
    so the representatives submitted the  application.  As  the  First-tier
    Tribunal determination does not deal with the s.47 removal decision  it
    is  arguable  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  and  so  I  admit   the
    application.

 5. Neither  the  Appellant  nor  his  representative  attended  the  Upper
    Tribunal for the hearing.  Notice  of  Hearing  was  sent  out  by  the
    Tribunal on 19th July.  When my clerk telephoned Malik Law Chambers she
    was told that a fax had been sent to the Tribunal on 12th August asking
    that it be dealt with on the papers.  No such fax has been received and
    I note that the copy faxed to-day contains no stamp suggesting that  it
    was faxed previously.  Be that as it may, as the representatives  asked
    that it be dealt with without their or their client's  presence  I  did
    so.

 6. The grounds are clearly a set piece - used in several cases - indeed  I
    have an identical set in another case before me  to-day.   They  assert
    that the Judge erred in failing  to  deal  with  s.47  which  case  law
    (Adamally  and  Jaferi  (section   47   removal   decisions:   Tribunal
    Procedures) [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC) confirms was an  unlawful  decision
    when made at the same time as a refusal to vary leave and that the  two
    are distinct decisions each requiring a  determination.  Ahmadi  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 512 indicates that where an unlawful s.47 removal decision has
    been made the appeal in that regard should be allowed.

 7. In this case the First-tier Tribunal did not make any decision  on  the
    removal decision.  The Secretary of State in her Rule 24 reply suggests
    that the Home Office Presenting Officer withdrew the  decision  on  the
    day in line with current policy.  However  the  Record  of  Proceedings
    gives no indication that was the case and Ms Isherwood, having  checked
    her note of the hearing confirmed that appeared to be the  case.   Thus
    the First-tier Tribunal did err in that regard.

 8. The grounds also assert that the Judge erred in dealing with Article 8.
     The Judge did not err in that regard.  The Appellant had been  in  the
    UK 2 ï¿½ years only (he is aged  40).   He  had  completed  his  original
    course of study and now wished at study another different course.   His
    Article 8 claim had no prospect of success.

 9. The First-tier  Tribunal  decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    plainly right and indeed the representative  from  Malik  Law  Chambers
    before the First-tier Tribunal conceded that the Appellant did not meet
    the Rules.

10. Accordingly the First-tier Tribunal having made an error of law only in
    failing to determine the s.47 issue I set aside the  determination  but
    preserve the findings under the Immigration Rules and Article 8.

11. I redecide the appeal and I dismiss it under the Immigration Rules  and
    Article 8.  I allow it in so  far  as  the  s.47  removal  decision  is
    unlawful.

12. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
