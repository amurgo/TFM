                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal concerns Mr MI, a national of Pakistan, whose date of birth
    is recorded as [ ] 1983.  On 29th May 2012 he was granted limited leave
    to enter the United Kingdom until 27th July 2014 as a spouse.  On  24th
    July 2014 he made application for variation of his leave. He relied  on
    there having been domestic violence. It is an important  ingredient  of
    the  Immigration  Rule  upon  which  reliance  was  placed   that   the
    relationship broke down as a result of domestic violence.   A  decision
    was made to refuse  the  application  on  11th  October  2014.   Mr  MI
    appealed.

 2. His appeal first came before Judge Davey,  sitting  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal at Taylor House on 6th  February  2015.   At  that  time  both
    parties were represented.  The Secretary of State was represented by Mr
    Kotas.  He had certain documents in his possession which he  sought  to
    rely upon but because the documents were to be filed  and  served  late
    and because the representatives of Mr MI would not have had  sufficient
    time to consider the contents  of  those  documents  the  matter  quite
    properly was adjourned.  The documents included a letter from  Mr  MI's
    wife dated 15th July 2014 which letter sets out something of the nature
    of the relationship between her and  Mr  MI  and  an  email  dated  6th
    February 2015, sent, I note, at  4:36  in  the  morning,  to  Mr  Kotas
    answering questions put by him but essentially that email was the basis
    of what might be described as an informal witness statement.

 3. The matter came back before the First-tier Tribunal on 23rd July  2015.
    The matter was heard by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Devittie.
    Although Judge Devittie does not record any  representation  by  either
    party in fact it is common ground and important in this matter that  Mr
    MI was represented by Mr Chohan who appears  before  me  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal but the Secretary of State, for whatever reason, did not  have
    representation.  It is not suggested  that  she  did  not  have  proper
    notice and so there was the opportunity for the Secretary of  State  to
    be represented at that hearing had she thought  fit.   The  history  of
    this matter is set out by  Judge  Devittie  in  his  Determination  and
    Reasons at some length.

 4. Mr MI arrived in the United Kingdom on 27th April 2012 with leave valid
    until 27th April 2014 as the spouse of a person settled in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Before the expiration of that leave he  made  an  application
    for leave to remain on the grounds of  domestic  violence  pursuant  to
    paragraph  289  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Paragraph  289  of   the
    Immigration Rules provides materially that an  applicant  has  to  show
    that his relationship has broken down as a result of domestic violence;
    there is a list of documentary  evidence  that  is  required  to  prove
    domestic violence.

 5. In the witness statement submitted by Mr MI  for  leave  to  remain  he
    stated that:

      i) He met his wife through a marriage bureau, in 2010. They married in
         2011.  After the marriage they lived in Pakistan with their parents
         for a while, and his wife gave birth to a son on [  ]  2011.   They
         remained in Pakistan for a while, to enable his wife to  return  to
         the United Kingdom to initiate the application process for  him  to
         join her in the United Kingdom as a spouse.

     ii) He obtained a spouse visa on 27th April 2012  and  arrived  in  the
         United Kingdom in December 2012.  Their daughter was  born  in  the
         United Kingdom on [ ] 2013.  Their difficulties began in July 2013.
          His wife was insisting that he should  make  a  greater  financial
         contribution to their joint expenses.  She was in good  employment,
         but he could not obtain suitable employment, because of his limited
         fluency in the English language.  He asked her  to  assist  him  in
         doing an English course, but she refused him to do  so.   She  kept
         him in the matrimonial home at all  times.   She  levelled  threats
         against him on a frequent basis and told him that  she  would  have
         him deported from the UK.  On more than one occasion she chased him
         out of the house.  He was too scared to call the police because  he
         feared he would be deported and would never see his children again.

    iii) In November 2013 his wife chased him out of  the  matrimonial  home
         and he has not returned since that date. She continued  to  contact
         him through the  telephone  and  through  text  messages  -  making
         persistent threats and causing him mental and  emotional  distress.
         He moved in with a friend.

     iv) After he had left the matrimonial home, she indicated to  him  that
         she wished to travel to Pakistan with the children.  At that stage,
         he had managed to obtain a court order prohibiting her  taking  the
         children out of the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  Kingdom  courts
         without his consent.  She gave him the undertaking that  she  would
         stay with the children with his  parents,  and  on  that  basis  he
         consented to her taking them to Pakistan for a period  of  no  more
         than 28 days.  His wife left for Pakistan with the two children  on
         14th November 2013, and after a month, she informed  him  that  she
         had left his parents, and had moved to reside with her  parents  in
         Pakistan.

      v) He tried in vain to contact  his  wife  at  her  parents'  home  in
         Pakistan.  When he did get through, her brother threatened to shoot
         him.  His emotional distress reached such  a  level,  that  he  was
         admitted into hospital suffering from anxiety and  depression.   He
         was very concerned that he would not see his kids again.   When  he
         did speak to his wife on one occasion when she was in Pakistan, she
         repeated her demand that he had to earn at least  ï¿½3,000  in  order
         for their marriage to continue.  He asked her to  assist  him  with
         funds and if she did so he would be happy to  travel  to  Pakistan.
         She refused to assist him.

     vi) On 7th May 2014 he was informed that his wife, had returned to  the
         United Kingdom, but only with her son, leaving  her  daughter  with
         her parents in Pakistan.   He  managed  after  some  difficulty  to
         contact his wife in the  United  Kingdom  and  to  have  a  limited
         contact on a few occasions with his son.  His wife  again  repeated
         her financial demands.  After a period of about ten days she denied
         him with any further contact with his son.  He  was  advised  by  a
         friend to contact a domestic violence group, but they  felt  unable
         to assist him, on the basis that they only assisted female victims.



    Judge Devittie then goes on to set out in his determination how  Mr  MI
    had himself described his contact with the police following  events  on
    18th June 2014.

 6. Mr MI gave live evidence which is set out  by  Judge  Devittie  in  the
    Record of Proceedings.  In addition Judge Devittie  had  before  him  a
    report dated 4th July 2014 from the Orient Medical Practice which spoke
    of Mr MI attending the emergency unit in March 2014  with  symptoms  of
    stress and anxiety for which he  received  medication.  There  is  also
    evidence that Mr MI attended the accident and emergency unit  in  April
    2014 with palpitations related to anxiety and stress.  Mr MI  was  seen
    again in June and July 2014 with it being recorded on  those  occasions
    that Mr MI had spoken at length about his  personal  circumstances  and
    marital difficulties.

 7. Mr MI was noted by Judge Devittie as having accepted that his wife  had
    not been physically abusive; his case was that he had been subjected to
    "emotional torture".  This is sometimes  otherwise  known  as  coercive
    controlling behaviour.  Examples were given to the judge such  as  "his
    wife had kicked him out of the house  in  the  middle  of  the  night".
    Further, "she had made him sleep on the floor".  Other examples are set
    out.

 8. Judge Devittie then makes reference to a report from the Ilford Medical
    Centre dated 13th July 2014  which  speaks  of  Mr  MI  suffering  from
    depression since last  year,  with  low  mood,  poor  sleep  and  panic
    attacks.  Importantly the report makes mention of Mr MI reporting  that
    he was a victim of domestic  violence  from  non-physical,  verbal  and
    emotional abuse.

 9. Judge Devittie further had a police report following  the  incident  of
    18th June 2014.  It reads as if the police were  certainly  sympathetic
    to Mr MI and there is previous  consistent  evidence  contained  within
    this report of Mr MI reporting that his wife  had,  "apparently  kicked
    him out of this address sometime around November".   The  Secretary  of
    State, as I have already observed, did not accept that the relationship
    had broken down as a result of domestic violence.  It was accepted that
    the marriage had broken down but the cause was an issue.

10. Judge Devittie went on to allow the appeal.  He found Mr  MI  to  be  a
    credible witness.  He took into account not only the  evidence  at  the
    hearing but also the various reports to which I have  referred  and  he
    noted that  there  was  a  remarkable  degree  of  consistency  in  the
    evidence.  In addition it was noted that there had been a wilful breach
    of a High Court order by the Appellant's  spouse,  a  factor  which  is
    material in this appeal because it goes to the credibility which  ought
    to be attached by me to further evidence which the Secretary  of  State
    invites me to consider.  I note that Judge Devittie said:

         "In my view the conduct of the Appellant's spouse in  breaching  an
         undertaking she gave to the court, is  not  inconsistent  with  the
         allegations that the Appellant (Mr MI)  has  made  against  her  in
         these proceedings and in his application for leave to remain on the
         grounds of domestic violence."

11. Judge Devittie noted that there was no attempt by Mr  MI  to  embellish
    his account and noted his demeanour. Judge Devittie noted  that  Mr  MI
    was tearful throughout his evidence and he was of  the  view  that  the
    demeanour was not contrived.  Judge Devittie had no hesitation  on  the
    basis of the evidence before him in allowing the appeal both under  the
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

12. Not content with that decision by notice dated 30th September 2013  the
    Secretary of State made application for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal on the basis that there was evidence  submitted  by  the
    Secretary of State at the first hearing, which was adjourned, which for
    some reason was either not before Judge Devittie or not  considered  by
    him.  On 11th April  2016  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Colyer
    granted permission.  Thus the matter comes before me.

13. Mr Bramble for the Secretary of State, in reliance upon  the  documents
    which I have read with care, contends that there was a  material  error
    of law.  He makes that submission on the basis that the evidence  which
    was submitted, being essentially a complete denial by  the  Appellant's
    wife of the behaviour which he, Mr MI, alleges, were it  considered  by
    Judge Devittie, was capable of materially affecting the outcome.

14. Clearly the judge ought to have had regard to that evidence.  The first
    hearing was adjourned in order that the evidence  could  be  considered
    and it does appear that Judge Devittie did not have regard to it and  I
    so find.  There was no reason  for  him  not  to  have  done  so.   The
    previous hearing was adjourned on 6th February  2015  and  there  is  a
    clear note from Judge Davey  as  to  the  reason  why  the  matter  was
    adjourned.   The  Secretary  of  State  was  entitled  to  have  proper
    consideration given to the evidence that was placed before her  and  in
    those circumstances I find that the error of law was material.

15. I go on to consider whether I ought to remit this matter to the  First-
    tier Tribunal or re-make the decision.  I see no reason  to  remit.   I
    have all the evidence before me.  The evidence which the  Secretary  of
    State wanted Judge Devittie to have regard to is  now  before  me  and,
    importantly, the Secretary of State was not represented at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal so no submissions would have been  made  and  importantly
    the evidence of the wife would not have  been  adduced.   There  is  no
    suggestion that she attended at the hearing.  Certainly that  forms  no
    part of the appeal and so in re-making the  decision  I  remind  myself
    that the burden of proof is upon Mr  MI.   He  has  to  satisfy  me  on
    balance of probabilities that the marriage broke down as  a  result  of
    domestic violence.  I do not need to set out the entire Rule because it
    is not in issue that the point that was to be  resolved  was  precisely
    that.  This is not a difficult case to resolve.  On the one hand was Mr
    MI who gave clear evidence that was accepted  as  consistent.   It  was
    corroborated.  Any idea of recent fabrication  is  dealt  with  by  the
    previous consistent evidence.  Formal evidence is not required in  this
    jurisdiction but section 6 of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 points to how
    recent fabrication and previous consistent evidence might be looked  at
    and any analysis of that legislation would be favourable to Mr MI.

16. Mr Bramble has been very realistic in his submissions.  He accepts that
    there are real difficulties for the  Secretary  of  State  because  the
    spouse was not called to give evidence and the Secretary of  State  was
    not represented.  What weight am I to give therefore to  the  evidence?
    On the one hand a man who has given consistent evidence and regarded as
    credible and on the other hand a witness statement and an  email  which
    has not been tested in circumstances in which,  with  a  background  of
    domestic violence, one might expect conflicts in the evidence  such  as
    this.  Clear it is that this was not a  happy  relationship  but  I  am
    satisfied on the basis of the totality of the evidence, and I have read
    with care the letter of 15th July 2014 and the email which  was  placed
    before me, that the Appellant in the First-tier Tribunal,  Mr  MI,  has
    proved his case.  Neither party require me to go  on  to  consider  any
    element of the Article 8 appeal which is irrelevant in any event if the
    appeal is allowed under the Rules.

Notice of Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  re-
    made such that the appeal is allowed both under the Rules and, for  the
    avoidance of doubt, on human rights grounds.

18. I have made an  Anonymity  Direction  because  of  the  nature  of  the
    behaviour to which the Appellant was subjected.

19. I do not interfere with the fee award that was not made in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for the reasons given by Judge Devittie as no submissions
    were made that I should do otherwise.
