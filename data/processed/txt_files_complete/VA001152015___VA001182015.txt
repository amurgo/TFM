                       Entry Clearance Officer - Amman
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Brown, Counsel instructed by TM Fortis Sols
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are both nationals of  Iraq.  They  are  respectively  a
    mother and son, and they want to come to the United Kingdom in order to
    visit a Mr Mohammad Hossein Ali Mohammad. Mr Mohammad  ('the  Sponsor')
    is the father of the First Appellant, and therefore the grandfather  of
    the Second Appellant.


 2. Mr Mohammad has been living in the United Kingdom since the early 1990s
    when he came to Britain as a refugee. He has never  returned  to  Iraq.
    He is now aged 99 and is unable to travel due  to  various  age-related
    ailments.  This was the background to why  his  daughter  and  grandson
    applied for visitor visas.

 3. Their applications were refused on the grounds that the Entry Clearance
    Officer (ECO) did not  accept  that  they  were  genuine  visitors  who
    intended to leave the United Kingdom at the  end  of  their  trip.  The
    information supplied did not  demonstrate  that  there  was  sufficient
    incentive for them to return to  Iraq,  given  the  worsening  security
    situation there.  Particular mention is  made  of  the  fact  that  the
    Second Appellant is a "repeater", i.e. a student who is resitting  some
    exams.

 4. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  and  it  is  common
    ground then when they did so, the appeals  were  limited  in  scope  to
    deciding whether the decisions of the ECO breached their human  rights,
    specifically their Article 8 ECHR right to a family life.

 5. The matter came before Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Baird. In a determination promulgated on the 10th  September  2015  the
    appeals were dismissed, on the ground that the Appellants had  not  got
    past the first Razgar hurdle[1] of establishing that there  is  here  a
    family life such that Article 8 is engaged. The Tribunal noted that the
    Sponsor had not seen his daughter for over 25 years. He had  never  met
    his grandson. It directed itself to the guidance in Mostafa (Article  8
    in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) and Adjei  (visit  visas  -
    Article 8) [2015] UKUT 261 (IAC). The sum of that guidance was that  an
    ability to meet the requirements of the Rules cannot  be  determinative
    in human rights  appeals.  Applicants  must  show  that  Article  8  is
    engaged, and it:

          "will only be in very unusual circumstances that  a  person  other
         than a close relative will be able to  show  that  the  refusal  of
         entry  clearance  comes  within  the  scope  of  Article  8(1).  In
         practical terms this is likely to be limited  to  cases  where  the
         relationship is that of a husband and  wife  or  other  close  life
         partners or a parent and minor child and  even  then  it  will  not
         necessarily be extended to cases where, for example,  the  proposed
         visit is based on a whim or will not add significantly to the  time
         that the people involved spend together."

    The Tribunal accepted that the emotional ties between the Sponsor,  his
    daughter and grandson may have been enhanced  by  his  age,  but  found
    there to be no evidence of Kugathas dependency[2].   As to whether  the
    Appellants actually met the requirements of the Immigration Rules, this
    was not a matter that required the Tribunal  to  make  a  finding;  the
    determination does however note that it is unsatisfactory for ECO's  to
    simply point to the security situation in  Iraq  to  refuse  individual
    cases.


      Error of Law

 6. The Appellants now appeal[3] on the following composite grounds:


              i) The Tribunal erred in  omitting  to  consider  whether  the
                 Appellants in fact met the requirements of paragraph 41;


             ii) There were in this appeal the "very unusual  circumstances"
                 of a credible sponsor whose dying wish it was to be able to
                 see his family. The Tribunal accepted that his physical and
                 moral integrity was likely affected by the decision and  in
                 these circumstances Article 8 was plainly engaged;

            iii) The Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to  have  regard  to  the
                 guidance in Kaur (visit appeals - Article  8)  [2015]  UKUT
                 487.


 7. In his oral submissions Mr Brown expanded on his grounds.  The headnote
    in Kaur reads as follows:


    1.     In visit appeals the Article 8 decision on an appeal  cannot  be
         made in a vacuum.  Whilst judges only have jurisdiction  to  decide
         whether the decision is unlawful under s.6 of the Human Rights  Act
         1998 (or shows unlawful discrimination) (see Mostafa (Article 8  in
         entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) and Adjei (visit  visas  -
         Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC)), the starting-point for deciding
         that must be the  state  of  the  evidence  about  the  appellant's
         ability to meet the requirements of paragraph 41 of the immigration
         rules.


    2.     The restriction in visitor cases of grounds of appeal  to  human
         rights does not mean that judges are  relieved  of  their  ordinary
         duties of fact-finding or  that  they  must  approach  these  in  a
         qualitatively different way.   Where  relevant  to  the  Article  8
         assessment, disputes as to the facts must  be  resolved  by  taking
         into account the evidence on both sides: see Adjei at [10]  bearing
         in mind that the burden of proof rests on the appellant.


    3.     Unless an appellant can show that there are individual interests
         at stake covered by Article 8 "of a particularly  pressing  nature"
         so as to give rise to a "strong claim that compelling circumstances
         may exist to justify the grant of LTE [Leave to Enter] outside  the
         rules": (see SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [40] and [56]) he or
         she is exceedingly unlikely to succeed.  That proposition must also
         hold good in visitor appeals.

 8. Mr Brown submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  in  these  cases
    attempted to resolve the Article 8 question in a vacuum.  Although  the
    Tribunal had deprecated the ECO's reasoning it had not gone on to  make
    clear findings  on  paragraph  41  and  that  rendered  the  Article  8
    assessment incomplete. It was not necessary to find  a  Kugathas  style
    dependency. These were unusual circumstances  factually  distinct  from
    those  cases  where  individuals  seek  to  resist  removal,  and  gain
    permanent leave, on the basis of relationships with other  adults.  The
    case of a very elderly refugee wishing to have a short period  of  time
    with his daughter and grandson was a paradigm  example  of  what  might
    constitute "very unusual circumstances".


 9. For the Respondent Mr Harrison  conceded  that  the  Tribunal  had  not
    followed the approach advocated in Kaur  but  relied  on  the  Rule  24
    response to point out that the Tribunal had not found Article 8  to  be
    engaged at all.



    Error of Law


10. The First-tier Tribunal heard this appeal on the 20th August 2015; Kaur
    was promulgated six days later.  It is therefore unsurprising that  the
    determination did not cite that decision or follow its  guidance.  That
    chronology notwithstanding the Respondent does however  agree  that  if
    the Appellants establish a failure to apply the law as it is stated  in
    Kaur, that will be a demonstrable error of law.


11. At paragraph 14 of the determination the First-tier Tribunal records "I
    have no jurisdiction to deal with the  refusal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules".  The Tribunal therefore declines to make any  findings  on  the
    requirements set out in paragraph 41, although it does  point  out  the
    deficiencies in the reasoning behind the refusal.

12. In Kaur the Upper Tribunal found there to be two reasons why  decision-
    makers should consider the terms of paragraph 41 in the  context  of  a
    human rights appeal against refusal to issue a visit visa. One would be
    the identification of the public interest, the requirements of the Rule
    reflecting where the balance should be struck. If an appellant can show
    that he meets the requirements that will plainly be pertinent,  if  not
    necessarily determinative, of the  question  of  proportionality.    In
    this Kaur is consistent with Mostafa and Adjei. The  Tribunal  in  Kaur
    went on however to find the Rules to be important for a further reason.
    It found that  there  was  a  significant  degree  of  overlap  between
    paragraph 41 and those matters under consideration in a Razgar  Article
    8 assessment:

         Whilst such  requirements are clearly not Article 8  considerations
         there is at least one obvious overlap in  subject-matter  when  the
         applicant  seeks  to  visit  family  members,   namely   that   the
         genuineness of the  intentions behind the visit (a requirement  set
         out in paragraph 41(i)) may be highly  material  to  the  issue  of
         whether there is family life within the  meaning  of  Article  8(1)
         and/ or the issue of whether there are strong family  life  reasons
         for the visit that are to be weighed in the balance  under  Article
         8(2).  In this context an inability  to  maintain  and  accommodate
         without recourse to public funds or employment may also be material
         to any Article 8 proportionality exercise. [at 13]


         [emphasis added]


13. In these cases the only question raised by the refusal was whether  the
    Appellants were genuine visitors who intended to leave the  UK  at  the
    end of their trip. Mr  Brown  submits  that  this  question  could  not
    sensibly be divorced from the nature  of  the  relationship  that  they
    shared with Mr Muhammad.  Applying the reasoning in Kaur, I would  have
    to agree.   The degree of overlap is illustrated by the closing remarks
    of the determination: "I do accept it to be likely that  the  Sponsor's
    physical and psychological integrity have been affected by the decision
    to refuse entry clearance but I cannot  take  the  view  that  this  is
    disproportionate to the need for effective immigration control  in  the
    UK".   Without a finding on whether the requirements  of  paragraph  41
    were met, it was not possible for the  Tribunal  to  have  conducted  a
    rounded assessment of whether Article 8 was engaged at all.


14. I am therefore satisfied that the determination does contain  an  error
    of law and the decision is set aside.

15. The second ground of appeal  was  whether  the  Tribunal  had  properly
    addressed the question of whether this was one of those "very  unusual"
    cases discussed in Mostafa, where persons other  that  close  relatives
    (i.e. spouses or minor children) can bring themselves within the  ambit
    of  Article  8.  The  determination  considers  the   nature   of   the
    relationships at paragraph 19. It is noted that it has been many  years
    since the Sponsor has seen his daughter,  and  he  has  never  met  his
    grandson  at  all.  On  these  facts  a  Kugathas  dependency  is   not
    established and so the Tribunal found there to be no Article  8  family
    life in play.  For the Respondent Mr Harrison agreed that the  Tribunal
    had here applied an impermissibly narrow definition of  'family  life'.
    In the context of an application for  entry  clearance   as  a  visitor
    there was rarely if ever going to be a Kugathas dependency between  the
    parties.  The question was whether there were individual  interests  at
    stake of a particularly pressing nature:  SS Congo v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 387.

    The Re-Made Decisions

16. The First-tier Tribunal found Mr Muhammad to be a credible witness.  Mr
    Harrison did not seek to go behind that finding and I did not therefore
    consider it necessary to hear any live evidence from him.   He has  set
    out his position in a witness statement dated 14th  August  2015.    Mr
    Muhammad explains that he was granted refugee status in the early 1990s
    and that he has never  returned  to  Iraq.    His  daughter  the  First
    Appellant  has  remained  there.  She  is  married  to    a   financial
    statistician and has a very comfortable life by  Iraqi  standards.   He
    has not seen her for over 25 years and has missed her dearly. He speaks
    with her regularly by telephone but  this  cannot  compensate  for  not
    seeing her in person. Although he  has  not  met  his  grandson  he  is
    "extremely proud" of him and would like to be able to meet  him,  spend
    quality time with him and "show him off" to friends  and  family.   The
    Second Appellant has told his grandfather that he wants  to  become  an
    architect and is hoping to go to university to study civil engineering.
    Mr Muhammad has been kept abreast of his educational  achievements  and
    states that he knows his grandson has worked very hard.   He has a goal
    of entry to a good university and it is for this  reason  that  he  has
    chosen to re-sit some of his exams to that he can achieve  the  highest
    grades possible.  Mr Muhammad recognises that his daughter and grandson
    will not be able to spend very long  with  him  because  they  need  to
    return to Iraq in order to get on with their lives but it would mean  a
    lot to him:

         "I can assure the Respondent that  for  what  little  time  we  are
         together I will be eternally grateful. I just want to  be  reunited
         with my daughter and be afforded an opportunity  to  meet  with  my
         grandson whom I have never met before it is too late for me".

17. The Appellant's bundle contains a letter from a Dr S Rizvi of the David
    Medical Centre in Chorlton,  Manchester.  Dr  Rizvi  is  Mr  Muhammad's
    doctor. He writes to confirm that Mr Muhammad is unable to fly  due  to
    various ailments that have affected his mobility. Mr Harrison  took  no
    issue with this evidence and accepted that Mr Muhammad would be  unable
    to visit his family in Iraq, or indeed any other third country. He  was
    aged 98 at the date of  decision  (he  is  now  approaching  his  100th
    birthday) and attended court in a wheelchair with the assistance of his
    daughter.


18. As to the position of the  Appellants  the  evidence  was  as  follows.
    Their applications were accompanied by  a  covering  letter  dated  2nd
    October 2014 in which they state that the family comprise  the  mother,
    father, a daughter aged 20 and the  Second  Appellant.  They  all  live
    together in a comfortable district of  Baghdad.   The  First  Appellant
    does not work because she does not need to. Her husband  has  earned  a
    good salary as a financial statistician and this  has  enabled  her  to
    stay at home and bring up their children.  Before she had children  she
    was employed by the Iraqi Government. The Second Appellant  is  in  the
    middle of his studies and is aiming to attend  university  in  Baghdad.
    The family live on  the  income  derived  from  the  First  Appellant's
    husband's employment with the Qualios Company for General Communication
    for which he earns $3500 per month.   They have savings of in excess of
    �50,000, demonstrated by the production of 'fixed deposit cheques'.  At
    the date of application the First Appellant held in excess  of  �13,500
    in a  separate  savings  account.   The  documents  supplied  with  the
    application included:


               . Birth certificates, marriage certificates, passports of all
                 family members (including those not travelling)
               . A letter dated 9th July 2014 from Ayad Mohammad,  executive
                 director  of  Qualios  Company  for  General  Communication
                 confirming that the First Appellant's husband  earns  $3500
                 per month
               . A fixed deposit cheque issued by Rafidain Bank in the  name
                 of the First Appellant's husband showing that between April
                 2014 and April 2015  he  held  a  fixed  deposit  of  fifty
                 million dinars (this is accompanied  by  a  OANDA  currency
                 conversion showing that to be equivalent of �25, 842)
               . A fixed deposit cheque issued by Rafidain Bank in the  name
                 of the First Appellant showing that between March 2014  and
                 March 2015 she held a fixed deposit of fifty million dinars
                 (this is accompanied by a OANDA currency conversion showing
                 that to be equivalent of �25, 842)
               . A Rafidian Bank savings book  in  the  name  of  the  First
                 Appellant's husband  showing  savings  of  3,000,000  Iraqi
                 dinars (this is accompanied by a OANDA currency  conversion
                 showing that to be equivalent of �1,550)
               . A Rafidian Bank savings book  in  the  name  of  the  First
                 Appellant showing savings of 26,382,727 Iraqi dinars  (this
                 is accompanied by a OANDA currency conversion showing  that
                 to be equivalent of �13,635)

19. The evidence supplied on application was supported on appeal by that of
    Mr Muhammad, who sets out his  own  understanding  of  their  financial
    situation in his witness statement. Whilst acknowledging that this  was
    not first hand information Mr Brown reminded me that  Mr  Muhammad  has
    gleaned his  knowledge  through  years  of  regular  contact  with  his
    daughter and her family (ie he has not simply written down what he  was
    told for the purpose of these appeals) and he has of course been  found
    to be a wholly  credible  witness.    The  Appellants'  bundle  further
    contains a signed statement by Ms  Azhar  Hussain,  who  is  the  First
    Appellant's sister. Again, Ms Azhar Hussain reports  that  through  her
    own regular contact with her sister she knows that  her  sister  has  a
    happy family unit in Iraq and  that  she  is  very  settled  there.  Ms
    Hussain explains that her sister has not previously applied for a  visa
    to come and visit her  father  because  she  has  had  her  own  caring
    responsibilities towards her mother-in-law, who was elderly and  unwell
    and only passed away in March 2014.  Both  family  members  in  the  UK
    stress that the Appellants have their whole life to return to in  Iraq,
    including the First Appellant's husband (the Second Appellant's father)
    and daughter (the Second Appellant's sister).


20. I have considered all of this evidence in the round and reminded myself
    that at all times the burden of proof in respect  of  establishing  the
    facts lies on the Appellants. The standard of proof  is  a  balance  of
    probabilities.


21. I share the view expressed by the First-tier Tribunal at  paragraph  14
    that the  ECO  (and  upon  review  ECM)  cannot  simply  point  to  the
    "worsening security situation" in Iraq to submit that these  Appellants
    are not genuine visitors. That is particularly so where it remains  the
    position of the Secretary of State  that  central  Baghdad,  where  the
    family live, is perfectly safe:  this  is  a  view  endorsed  in  large
    measure by the latest country guidance AA (Article 15(c))  Iraq  [2015]
    UKUT 544 (IAC).  Whilst the general country background situation may be
    relevant, it cannot be determinative.  It  is  a  matter  that  I  have
    attached some weight to.

22. I am satisfied that the family situation in Iraq is as claimed. I  note
    that the First Appellant has  been  able  to  leave  Iraq  on  numerous
    occasions, entering Jordan several  times  in  recent  years.  She  has
    always returned to Baghdad. She has family members in the UK,  the  USA
    and New Zealand yet has never sought to visit any of them before.  This
    would tend to indicate that she has no pressing  desire  to  leave  her
    home.

23. The Appellants would be travelling without the  other  two  members  of
    their nuclear family, who would be remaining  in  Baghdad.  This  would
    tend to indicate that they would be likely to return there.

24. The Appellants have demonstrated that they are  financially  secure  in
    Iraq. Although the First Appellant did not  provide  payslips  for  her
    husband's employment I accept that these are not necessarily  documents
    which would be available. As it is put in  the  evidence,  "things  are
    different in Iraq". The financial documents supplied went  unchallenged
    by Mr Harrison and I accept that these demonstrate that the family  has
    a good deal of financial security in the form of savings. I accept that
    they have been able to accrue these savings because of  the  salary  of
    the First Appellant's husband.

25. I accept that the Second  Appellant  has  an  incentive  to  return  to
    Baghdad. He has a home, father, sister, school  and  no  doubt  friends
    there.  The fact that he has decided to re-sit some exams does  not  in
    itself provide an incentive to leave the country.

26. I accept, having had regard to all of the evidence before me, that  the
    Appellants do have a  genuine  reason  to  want  to  visit  the  United
    Kingdom. The First Appellant has not seen her father for many years and
    I accept that it is wholly natural for a daughter to wish  to  see  her
    father again before he dies, and vice versa. Although they have kept in
    touch by telephone I accept that physically seeing each other would  be
    a significant event and that it means a great deal to  Mr  Muhammad  in
    particular.

27. Overall I am satisfied that the Appellants  are  genuine  visitors  and
    that they do intend to return to their home in Baghdad once their  trip
    to the UK is over.

28. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance has affected the physical and psychological integrity  of  Mr
    Muhammad and I agree with that  assessment.    Mr  Muhammad  left  Iraq
    during the height of Saddam Hussain's repression and was recognised  as
    a refugee. I accept that this dislocation from his homeland and  family
    must have been very difficult for him and that as he reaches the end of
    his life it has become increasingly important to him to see his  family
    members.   I accept that fulfilling his wish is also a matter of  great
    significance to the Appellants, who of course would also desire to  see
    him and spend time with him. Whilst ties between  a  parent  and  adult
    child or between a grandparent and adult grandchild will  not  normally
    constitute family life for the purpose of Article 8(1) I accept that in
    these particular circumstances the Article is  engaged.  The  "pressing
    need" test set out in SS Congo is amply  met.  The  background  to  the
    family's dislocation, the fact that the Sponsor  is  unable  to  travel
    himself and the fact that this will, in all  likelihood,  be  the  last
    opportunity that the Appellants have to spend  time  with  Mr  Muhammad
    cumulatively amount to the "very unusual  circumstances"  mentioned  in
    Mostafa.  If this is the last opportunity that these three people  have
    to enjoy a family life together in the normal way this  has  served  to
    intensify the emotional desire that the parties have  to  be  reunited.
    I accept that there are compelling emotional bonds between the Sponsor,
    his daughter and grandson and  that  in  the  particular  circumstances
    Article 8 is engaged.


29. Mr Harrison conceded that the decision does represent an  interference,
    since Mr Muhammad is unable to travel. Reminding myself that  the  need
    to maintain immigration control is a legitimate aim under Article  8(2)
    I consider proportionality in light of the facts and  the  guidance  of
    the Upper Tribunal that I have mentioned above. I accept  and  find  as
    fact that the Appellants are genuine visitors who intend to  leave  the
    United Kingdom at the end of their trip and that they meet all  of  the
    requirements of paragraph 41 of the Rules. I accept that  the  personal
    emotional loss to them of being  refused  entry  on  this  occasion  is
    likely to be profound and irrevocable. The impact on the Sponsor is  no
    less significant and  cumulatively  there  are  strong  and  compelling
    reasons to grant entry clearance.  For those reasons I  find  that  the
    decisions to refuse entry are not proportionate and allow the appeals.


      Decisions

30. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside.


31. I remake the decisions in the appeals by allowing the appeals on  human
    rights grounds.  Given the age of the Sponsor the  Respondent  will  no
    doubt wish to act upon this decision as soon  as  practicably  possible
    and issue the relevant visas.

32. I was  not  asked  to  make  a  direction  for  anonymity  and  in  the
    circumstances I see no reason to do so.
