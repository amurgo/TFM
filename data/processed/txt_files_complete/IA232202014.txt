Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge   Quinn   sitting   at   Richmond
    Magistrates' Court on 18 May  2015)  whereby  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    allowed under the Rules and under Article 8 ECHR the claimant's  appeal
    against the decision by the Secretary of State  to  remove  her  as  an
    overstayer.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an   anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider  that  the  claimant  requires  to  be
    accorded anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On  14  August  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         2.   The Appellant's  application  for  LTR  under  article  8  was
             refused.   The  appeal  was  allowed  on  the  basis  of   the
             Appellant's relationship and that  there  were  insurmountable
             obstacles to that continuing in Jamaica.

         3.   The grounds argue that the Judge erred in  the  assessment  of
             article  8  by  reference  to  Agyarko  and  the  evidence  of
             insurmountable obstacles  was  limited.   The  fact  that  the
             Appellant's partner was a British national and had not ties to
             Jamaica (the grounds erroneously state Ghana) and  might  find
             relocation  difficult  did  not   amount   to   insurmountable
             obstacles.

         4.   A poor immigration history counts heavily against an Appellant
             and any life established whilst in the UK illegally inevitably
             attracts little weight and the decision of a British  national
             to enter a relationship with such a person  also  lessens  the
             complaints such a person might have about the  enforcement  of
             immigration control.  One might add that there was no analysis
             of how long there had been a relationship akin to marriage  or
             any analysis of the maintenance requirements.

The Factual Background

 3. The claimant is a national of Jamaica, whose date of  birth  is  5  May
    1957.  She arrived in the UK on 12 October 1998 and was  granted  leave
    to enter as a visitor until 12 May 1999.  She remained in the UK  after
    her leave as a visitor expired, and did  not  seek  to  regularise  her
    status until 16 April 2011 when she applied  for  leave  to  remain  on
    medical grounds under Article 3  ECHR,  and  family  and  private  life
    grounds under Article 8 ECHR.  In  a  letter  dated  25  May  2011  the
    Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing the application.   The
    case had been considered in the light inter alia of the House of  Lords
    decision in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.  That case  addressed  the
    issue of the lawfulness of the Secretary of State's policy that  people
    relying on Article 8 should leave the UK in  order  to  make  an  entry
    clearance  application.   It  was  not  accepted  that  the  claimant's
    circumstances were such that it was unlawful to require her  to  return
    to Jamaica.  She claimed to  have  been  in  a  relationship  with  her
    partner since 2005, but had only submitted documents  showing  she  had
    lived with her partner since 2011 and a letter from  Barclays  Bank  to
    show she had held a joint account with her  claimed  partner  for  four
    years.  Thus although she might have family life with her  partner,  it
    was short-lived and therefore she could return to Jamaica in  order  to
    return through the correct channels if  she  wished  to  do  so.   Visa
    processing times in Jamaica were a maximum of 120  days,  during  which
    time 99% of all applications submitted were  concluded.   It  would  be
    reasonable to expect the claimant to return overseas and any  temporary
    interference with her  claimed  family  life  while  she  sought  entry
    clearance was proportionate.  The claimant had  not  been  granted  any
    further leave to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  had
    continued to live and work here when she did not have permission to  do
    so.  The claimant was fully aware since the expiry of her visa that she
    had no valid leave to remain.   She  claimed  she  did  not  return  to
    Jamaica because she was advised against travel after having  a  medical
    check up.  But she could provide no explanation as to why she  did  not
    inform the UK Border agency of the change in her  circumstances  before
    the expiry of her leave to enter as a visitor.  This cast serious doubt
    upon the credibility of her application.  In  the  light  of  her  poor
    immigration  history  and  blatant  disregard   for   the   immigration
    regulations, the proposed interference with her Article  8  rights  was
    proportionate.

 4. The claimant was not given a right of  appeal,  as  she  did  not  have
    extant leave when she made  her  application.   On  11  July  2011  her
    solicitors asked for her application to be reconsidered.   On  8  April
    2014 the Home Office asked her  to  provide  further  information,  and
    issued  her  with  a  One-Stop  Warning  under  Section  120   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. Her solicitors responded on  29  April  2014,  enclosing  a  number  of
    documents.  They included a death certificate for the claimant's former
    partner, Mr Jaldo, who had died on 4 October 2011.  In the Statement of
    Additional Grounds, the solicitors said  the  claimant  was  now  in  a
    relationship with Mr Paul Fraser, whose date of birth  was  9  February
    1958, and who was a British citizen by birth.  They  had  attended  the
    same church for a long time but did not have  much  contact  with  each
    other.  Following the claimant's bereavement, Mr Fraser  provided  much
    needed comfort and moral support.  They had become  close  and  started
    living together.  They lived at the claimant's address in  Tulse  Hill.
    He worked as a bus driver, and he contributed  towards  the  bills  and
    council tax relating to the property.  The property in Tulse  Hill  had
    been transferred to the claimant as the successor-in-title of the  late
    Mr Jaldo.

 6. On 12 May 2014 the Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for  being
    satisfied that the  claimant's  removal  would  not  breach  her  human
    rights.  She met the suitability requirements of Appendix  FM,  but  it
    was noted that she had not provided proof of payment for the  extensive
    treatments she had received from the NHS despite  having  no  right  to
    remain in the UK or to access non-emergency NHS treatment.

 7. She did not meet the eligibility requirements to remain in the UK as  a
    partner.  Under GEN.1.2 a partner meant the applicant's spouse; or  the
    applicant's civil partner; or the applicant's fiancï¿½ or proposed  civil
    partner; or a person who has been living together with the applicant in
    a relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at least two
    years prior to the date of application.

 8. The claimant did not fulfil the requirement for leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom in line with GEN.1.2 in view of the fact  that  she  had
    not shown she had lived with her  claimed  partner  for  at  least  two
    years.  She admitted that they had only been cohabiting  for  seventeen
    months.

 9. In regard to EX.1, as the claimant had failed to meet  the  eligibility
    criteria under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  as  a  partner  or
    parent it was not accepted that she  could  meet  the  requirements  of
    EX.1(b).  But even if she had demonstrated that  she  met  the  partner
    route, it was not demonstrated that there were insurmountable obstacles
    to family life with Mr Fraser continuing outside the UK.

10. With regard to private life, she did not  satisfy  the  requirement  of
    Rule 276ADE(1)(vi), which was that she had lived continuously in the UK
    for less than twenty years but had no ties (including social,  cultural
    or family) with the country to which she would have to go  if  required
    to leave the UK.  Subparagraph (1)(vi) did not apply, and might not  be
    relied upon, in circumstances in which it  was  proposed  to  return  a
    person to a third country pursuant to Schedule  3  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.  Furthermore,  the
    claimant had provided no evidence to show that she had no ties  to  her
    home country.  While she claimed to have no contact with  her  son  who
    continued to live in Jamaica, the duration of her absence from  Jamaica
    was not of sufficient length that this relationship, along  with  other
    relationships with friends and extended family in Jamaica, could not be
    re-established upon her return.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. Both parties were legally represented before the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    and the judge received oral evidence from the claimant and Mr Fraser.

12. The judge's findings of credibility and fact are set out  at  paragraph
    [29] onwards, and I reproduce them below.

         29. The Appellant had been in the UK since October 1998.   However
             I note that little weight should be given to any private  life
             when  a  person's  immigration  status  is  precarious.    The
             Appellant only had leave to remain as a visitor for six months
             and thereafter she was in the UK illegally.

         30. She had left matters for thirteen years before contacting  the
             authorities and had gone under the  radar.   Therefore  little
             weight should be given to any private life established by  her
             in any event.

         31. I noted that during the time that she had been in the  UK  she
             had been a partner of Altroy  Jaldo  and  had  an  outstanding
             application for leave to remain as his partner made  in  April
             2011.  Unfortunately he died in October 2011.

         32. No decision had been made by the Respondent as to whether  the
             Appellant could qualify as the partner  of  Mr  Jaldo  but  it
             seemed to me given that she had been  living  with  him  since
             2005 and it was not in dispute that he was a  British  citizen
             then it seemed to me that  the  Rules  were  satisfied.   That
             however was not the issue in dispute in this appeal.

         33. Mrs Nicholson began a relationship with Mr Fraser in  December
             2012 but as I have indicated  that  relationship  was  entered
             into by both parties in the knowledge that Mrs  Nicholson  was
             not legally in the UK.

         34. The Appellant said that she had no ties to her native  country
             of Jamaica.  She did however have a  son  there  although  she
             said she had lost contact with him.

         35. I did accept that if she returned to Jamaica she would have no
             job and nowhere to live.

         36. Whilst health care in Jamaica might not be as good as  in  the
             UK, there was no persuasive evidence before me to persuade  me
             that Mrs Nicholson's health  would  deteriorate  if  she  were
             returned to Jamaica.

         37. Further she had relatives in the USA and she would  be  nearer
             them if she were in Jamaica and it  was  possible  they  might
             assist her financially.

         38. Another factor weighing against the Appellant was that she had
             been a substantial drain on the NHS  without  contributing  to
             it.

         39. I accepted that Mrs Nicholson was in a genuine and  subsisting
             relationship with Mr Fraser and that the  parties  would  have
             married if they had access  to  their  passports  (which  were
             retained by the Respondent).

         40. Had they married the Respondent might have taken  a  different
             view of the Appellant's application.

         41. I had to take account of Section 117B and that the maintenance
             of  an  effective  immigration  control  was  in  the   public
             interest.  This was a significant hurdle  to  the  Appellant's
             Article 8 claim.

         42. If the Appellant were to return to  Jamaica  her  relationship
             with Mr Fraser could continue.  They could speak to each other
             on the phone and on Skype and he could visit her.

         43. Looking at all the evidence in the round I did not think  that
             the Appellant had a strong Article 8 claim.

         44. However, I had to look at the Article 8 rights of other people
             and I therefore had to consider Mr Fraser's Article 8  rights.
             He was a British citizen who had been in the UK all  his  life
             and had no family in Jamaica.

         45. In the UK he had an uncle, several cousins and four  children.
             He had brothers here and an elderly mother to whom he provided
             care.

         46. Mr Fraser had a right to family life.  The case of Beoku-Betts
             established this.  If Mrs Nicholson were to return to  Jamaica
             that would disrupt family life between her and Mr Fraser.

         47. Mr Fraser was a UK citizen and has a right to remain in the UK
             and it is not unreasonable for him to expect to remain in  the
             UK.

         48. If he were to relocate to Jamaica and follow Mrs Nicholson, he
             would have no job and  nowhere  to  live.   Contact  with  his
             children would be rendered  difficult  and  contact  with  his
             mother would be reduced to telephone  contact  and  occasional
             visits to the UK by him.

         49. He  had  a  home  and  a  job  in  the  UK  and  a  meaningful
             relationship with Mrs Nicholson involved more  than  telephone
             and contact on Skype.  Case law  supported  the  finding  that
             social and sexual  contact  formed  an  integral  part  of  an
             ongoing relationship.

         50. I took account of the fact that Mr Fraser is over the  age  of
             55.  He did not  appear  to  be  a  wealthy  man  and  it  was
             difficult to see how he would be able to provide himself  with
             accommodation in Jamaica and maintain that accommodation.

         51. In considering his Article 8 rights I came to  the  conclusion
             that  the  Respondent's  decision  was  disproportionate.    I
             considered the five questions in the case of Razgar  and  came
             to the conclusion that the removal of Mr Fraser's partner  was
             not proportionate to the legitimate public end  sought  to  be
             achieved.

         52. I  went  on  to  consider  the  Appellant's  claim  under  the
             Immigration Rules.

         53. She had made her application  in  April  2011  and  I  had  to
             consider whether the new Rules applied  to  applications  made
             before 9th July 2012.

         54. I considered the cases of Edgehill v Secretary  of  State  for
             the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 402 and Singh and Khalid v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 74.

         55. Odelola v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25 established that changes in  the
             Immigration Rules apply not only to applications for leave  to
             enter or remain made on or  after  the  date  that  they  take
             effect but also to applications pending at  that  date  unless
             the Statement of  Changes  in  question  contains  an  express
             indication to the contrary.

         56. The implementation provision in HC 194 reads "however,  if  an
             application for entry clearance, leave to remain or indefinite
             leave to remain has been made before 9th  July  2012  and  the
             application has not  been  decided,  it  will  be  decided  in
             accordance with the Rules in force on 8th July 2012".

         57. I noted what Jackson LJ said in Edgehill, namely

                  "The Immigration Rules need to be understood not  only  by
                  specialist  immigration  Counsel,  but  also  by  ordinary
                  people who read the Rules and try to abide by them.  I  do
                  not  think  that   (Counsel's)   interpretation   of   the
                  transitional provision  accords  with  the  interpretation
                  with which any ordinary reader would place upon them".

         58. I also noted the case of Haleemudeen v SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
             558 which was heard two weeks after the judgment was given  in
             Edgehill but that the decision in Haleemudeen was  later  held
             to be per incuriam.  I therefore thought that I could look  at
             Mrs Nicholson's claim under the old Rules.

         59. The Appellant qualified for leave under the old Rules  on  the
             basis  with  Mr  Fraser.   She  had  been   in   an   existing
             relationship and he was a British citizen.

         60. Under the new  provisions  (Section  EX.1.(a))  the  Appellant
             could qualify for leave if she had a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a  British
             citizen, settled in the UK or in the UK with refugee leave  or
             humanitarian protection and there are insurmountable obstacles
             to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.





         61. EX.2 stated that

                  "For the purposes of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  'insurmountable
                  obstacles' means the very significant  difficulties  which
                  would be faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
                  continuing their family life together outside the  UK  and
                  which could not be overcome or would entail  very  serious
                  hardship for the applicant or their partner".

         62. I accepted  that  the  Appellant  and  Mr  Fraser  were  in  a
             relationship akin to marriage and that the  only  reason  they
             had not gone through a marriage ceremony was because the  Home
             Office had Mrs Nicholson's passport.   Mrs  Nicholson  had  no
             real ties to Jamaica having been in the UK  for  over  sixteen
             years.  It was difficult to see  how  she  would  be  able  to
             restart her life if she had to go back  to  Jamaica.   If  her
             partner were to join her he would have  no  visible  means  of
             support and nowhere to live.

         63. Given these factors and the ages of  the  parties,  I  thought
             that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
             continuing with that partner outside of the UK.   I  therefore
             find that Section EX  of  Appendix  FM  is  satisfied  on  the
             particular facts of this case.

         64. Given the above findings  and  conclusions  I  find  that  the
             Appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proof to  show
             that her removal would be disproportionate in respect  of  her
             Article 8 rights but it would be disproportionate  in  respect
             of Mr Fraser's Article 8 rights and would therefore cause  the
             UK  to  be  in  breach  of  its  obligations  under  the  1950
             Convention as regards to Article 8  thereof  and  therefore  I
             allow the appeal.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

13. The Specialist Appeals Team settled an application  for  permission  to
    appeal on behalf of the Secretary of State.  They submitted  the  judge
    had erred in his assessment of Article 8 and this was further supported
    by the  findings  in  the  case  of  Agyarko  and  Others,  R  (on  the
    application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 440 at paragraphs [24] and [25] in which the court said  inter
    alia:

         The mere facts that Mr Benett is a British citizen, has  lived  all
         his life in the United Kingdom and has a job here - and hence might
         find it difficult and might be reluctant to relocate  to  Ghana  to
         continue  their  family  life  there   -   could   not   constitute
         insurmountable obstacles to his doing so.

The Error of Law Hearing

14. At the hearing to determine whether an error of law was  made  out,  Mr
    Jesurum relied on the Rule 24  response  prepared  by  his  instructing
    solicitors.  The judge had given  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles.  Agyarko was  distinguishable,  as
    in this appeal there was the  additional  factor  that  the  claimant's
    partner would not be able to provide care for his mother from overseas.
    Reliance was placed on Mukarkar v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1045  where  the
    Tribunal said at paragraph [40]:

         Factual judgments of this kind are often not easy, but they are not
         made easier or better by excessive legal  or  linguistic  analysis.
         It is in the nature of such  judgments  that  different  Tribunals,
         without  illegality   or   irrationality,   may   reach   different
         conclusions on the same case ... the mere fact  that  one  Tribunal
         has reached what may seem an unusually generous view of  the  facts
         in a particular case does not mean that it has  made  an  error  of
         law, so as to justify an appeal under the old system, or  an  order
         for reconsideration under the new.

15. In oral argument, Mr Jesurum submitted that, on a  proper  construction
    of Appendix FM, Mr Fraser was rightly  treated  by  the  judge  as  the
    claimant's partner, although they had not been cohabiting for a  period
    of two years at the date of application.  Alternatively, it was open to
    the judge for the reasons he gave, and on the facts as found,  to  hold
    that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life  being  enjoyed
    in Jamaica, and thus to allow the appeal outside the Rules.

16. I raised the question of Chikwamba.   Mr  Jesurum  submitted  that  the
    claimant could not reasonably be expected to go back to Jamaica to seek
    entry clearance as Mr Fraser did not meet the income requirements.  The
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  showed  that  he  was  earning
    ï¿½15,000 a year, and the claimant was thus ï¿½3,600 short of  the  minimum
    income threshold requirement.

17. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Whitwell relied on the Appendix
    FM guidance on family and private life dated November 2014:

         The assessment of whether there are insurmountable obstacles  is  a
         different and more stringent assessment than whether  it  would  be
         reasonable to expect the applicant's partner to join them overseas.
          For example, a British citizen partner who has lived in the UK all
         their life, has friends and family here, works here and speaks only
         English may not wish to uproot  and  relocate  halfway  across  the
         world, and it may be very difficult  for  them  to  do  so,  but  a
         significant degree of hardship or inconvenience does not amount  to
         an insurmountable obstacle.  ECHR Article 8 does not oblige the  UK
         to accept the choice of a couple as to  which  country  they  would
         prefer to reside in.

         Being separated from extended family members - such as might happen
         where the partner's partners and/or siblings live here - would  not
         usually amount to an insurmountable  obstacle,  unless  there  were
         particular exceptional factors in the case.

         A material change in quality of life for the  applicant  and  their
         partner in the country of return, such as the type of accommodation
         they would live in, or a  reduction  in  their  income,  would  not
         usually amount to an insurmountable obstacle.

         The factors which might be relevant to the consideration of whether
         an insurmountable obstacle exists include but are not  limited  to:
         (a) ability to lawfully enter and  stay  in  another  country;  (b)
         cultural  barriers;  (c)  the  impact  of  a  mental  or   physical
         disability; (d) the security situation in the country of return.





Reasons for finding an Error of Law

18. The judge has fallen into material error as the result  of  failing  to
    follow the correct methodology.  As adumbrated in  the  Nagre  line  of
    jurisprudence, and as affirmed relatively  recently  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in SS (Congo), the judge ought to have begun with an analysis of
    whether the claimant could bring  herself  within  the  Rules  (correct
    answer, no); and, having answered the first question in  the  negative,
    asked himself whether there were compelling circumstances  which  meant
    that the claimant and her partner should nonetheless be granted Article
    8 relief outside the Rules.  Such an analysis would have to  take  into
    account the factors listed in Section 117B and also whether there was a
    reasonable alternative option available to the  couple  which  was  the
    claimant returning to Jamaica to seek entry clearance as the fiancï¿½e or
    spouse of Mr Fraser.

Appendix FM

19. Dealing with the issues in the  correct  order,  the  judge  materially
    erred in failing to acknowledge that the  claimant  did  not  meet  the
    eligibility requirements of Appendix FM, and therefore  she  could  not
    qualify for leave to remain under Appendix FM on the ground that  there
    were insurmountable obstacles to her carrying on family  life  with  Mr
    Fraser in Jamaica.  The Rules are very clear.  Mr Fraser  was  not  the
    claimant's partner for the purposes of Appendix  FM  as  they  had  not
    lived together in a relationship akin to marriage for two years.

20. There was evidence that they had recently become engaged,  and  it  was
    open to the judge to find that they would have got married by the  date
    of the hearing if the claimant had been in possession of her  passport.
    But under the Rules, a fiancï¿½ cannot make an in-country application for
    leave to remain. A fiancï¿½ has to apply from abroad for entry  clearance
    to join his/her partner in the UK. Hence, when considering her  Article
    8 claim outside the rules, the judge needed to address the question  of
    whether it was reasonable to expect the claimant  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance from Jamaica. She would be given back her passport when being
    removed to Jamaica, or when returning there  voluntarily,  and  so  the
    previous  impediment  to   her   getting   married   would   evaporate.
    Alternatively, in an entry clearance application she could rely on  her
    engagement to Mr  Fraser  as  enabling  her  to  meet  the  eligibility
    requirements of Appendix FM.

Insurmountable obstacles outside the Rules

21. If there were insurmountable obstacles  to  the  claimant  carrying  on
    family life with Mr  Fraser  in  Jamaica,  this  would  be  a  powerful
    consideration in favour of the claimant being granted Article 8  relief
    outside the Rules. But it would not necessarily be determinative of the
    outcome. Even if there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    being continued in Jamaica, the Article 8 claim  might  still  fail  if
    countervailing  considerations  of  immigration  control  prevailed  or
    because the couple had a reasonable alternative option of the  claimant
    going back to Jamaica to seek entry clearance as a partner.

22. In paragraph [24] of Agyarko  the  Court  affirmed  that  in,  a  wider
    Article 8 assessment outside the Rules, "insurmountable obstacles"  was
    a factor to be taken into account, not an  absolute  requirement  which
    had to be satisfied.

23. Mr Jesurum relies on this  passage  in  Agyarko  as  strengthening  his
    argument that the judge made no material error in allowing  the  appeal
    on the grounds of insurmountable obstacles. As it is  not  an  absolute
    requirement which has to be satisfied outside  the  rules,  he  submits
    that, if it is in fact satisfied outside the  rules,  then  a  fortiori
    this should be decisive of the outcome, or at least it  was  reasonably
    open to the judge to find that it was decisive.

24. I reject this submission as it  flies  in  the  face  of  the  parallel
    observation in paragraph [24] of Agyarko, which is that the presence of
    insurmountable obstacles is simply one factor to be taken into  account
    in the wider proportionality assessment.

25. In  addition,  the  judge's  finding  of  insurmountable  obstacles  is
    inadequately reasoned. As stated in the IDIs, the assessment of whether
    there are insurmountable obstacles is a different  and  more  stringent
    assessment  than  whether  it  would  be  reasonable  to   expect   the
    applicant's partner to join them overseas.  The judge's earlier reasons
    for finding that it would not be reasonable to expect Mr Fraser to join
    the appellant overseas are essentially the same reasons which he  later
    gives for finding that there are insurmountable  obstacles  -  although
    his inability to care for his mother is not one of  them,  contrary  to
    what is stated in the Rule 24 Response. This discloses an error of law,
    as  the  judge  has  failed  to  acknowledge  that   the   concept   of
    insurmountable  obstacles  requires  a  different  and  more  stringent
    assessment than that which he has performed.

Other errors in the wider proportionality assessment

26. In a wider proportionality assessment outside  the  Rules,  it  is  not
    necessary for the  claimant  to  show  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in  the  country  of  return.   The
    correct test is whether it  is  reasonable  to  expect  the  claimant's
    partner to join them overseas. But the corollary of this question in  a
    case such as this is whether in the alternative  it  is  reasonable  to
    expect the claimant to go back on her own and to make an application to
    return as a partner.  The judge wholly failed to address this question,
    and so the Article 8 assessment is fatally flawed.

27. The wider proportionality assessment was also fatally  flawed  for  two
    other reasons.  Firstly, in finding  that  it  was  not  reasonable  to
    expect Mr Fraser to relocate to Jamaica, the  judge  failed  to  remind
    himself that the relationship between the claimant and  Mr  Fraser  had
    been developed in the full knowledge that the  claimant's  status  here
    was unlawful, and thus Mr Fraser had no legitimate expectation  of  the
    claimant being allowed to settle here as his  partner.   Secondly,  the
    judge needed to weigh in  the  balance  considerations  of  immigration
    control before reaching the conclusion that it was  not  reasonable  to
    expect Mr Fraser to relocate to  Jamaica.   The  judge  did  this  when
    looking at the matter from the claimant's perspective,  but  failed  to
    perform the required balancing exercise  when  addressing  Mr  Fraser's
    right to respect for his family and private life.

28. In conclusion, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is vitiated by a
    material error of law, such that it must be set aside and remade.

29. This is an appropriate case for retention by the Upper  Tribunal,  even
    though some further fact-finding may be necessary. So there will  be  a
    further hearing before me to remake the decision, with a time  estimate
    of 1.5 hours.

30. The judge's findings of fact relating to the genesis and development of
    the relationship between the claimant and Mr Fraser will be preserved.

31. On the remaining issues, the claimant has permission to adduce  further
    evidence, provided that such evidence is  served  in  a  paginated  and
    indexed bundle on the Specialist Appeals Team and  the  Upper  Tribunal
    not less than 7 days before the resumed hearing.

The Resumed Hearing

32. Mr Fraser was called as a witness, and he adopted as  his  evidence-in-
    chief his witness statement dated 13 January 2016.  He was now  working
    full-time for "Integration" an employment agency based in Enfield  that
    provided drivers to "Abellio" a  bus  company  which  engaged  in  rail
    replacement work.  He was submitting documentary evidence in  the  form
    of Barclays Bank statements, available pay slips and available P60s, to
    show that he was now earning in excess of ï¿½18,600 a year.

33. He would face a number of obstacles if he moved to Jamaica to live with
    Catherine.  He did not have any  connection  with  Jamaica.   Catherine
    would not have a job and she would not have any income.  She  also  was
    not going to have any accommodation available for  them.   He  was  not
    going to reach pensionable age until he was 67.   As  unemployment  was
    very high in Jamaica, it would be difficult for him to get a job  as  a
    foreigner.  There were many younger people who could do a  driving  job
    in Jamaica.  Having no income or the means of generating income was the
    greatest obstacle he would face if he had to go and  live  in  Jamaica.
    He did not have any special working skills, including technical and  IT
    skills.  He had become a bus driver fourteen years ago and that was the
    only skill that he had now.

34. The Home Office might say that Catherine could return  to  Jamaica  and
    they could get married there, and she could return here  as  his  wife.
    But she did not have any accommodation or family there and she would be
    vulnerable to crime.  She got blackouts in stressful  circumstances  or
    in close surroundings.  She did not travel by underground  tube  train,
    because she feared that if she got a blackout the tube train could  not
    stop between stations.  For this reason she would always travel by  bus
    however long the journey was.  If she had  to  return  to  Jamaica,  he
    would have to accompany her and  stay  with  her.   This  would  create
    problems with his financial ability to maintain her for a spousal visa.



35. In cross-examination, Mr Fraser  said  that  Catherine  had  a  son  in
    Jamaica, but they were not in contact.  She did not know where  he  was
    in Jamaica.  The part of Jamaica that she came from was  St  Catherine.
    He was not sure if she kept in touch with friends in Jamaica.

36. Mr Bramble asked him why she could not make an  application  to  return
    here as his partner.  He said she  would  not  be  able  to  obtain  in
    Jamaica the medication that she was on here.  Mr Bramble asked if there
    was any other reason.  He answered they were engaged to be married.

37. In answer to questions for clarification purposes from  me,  Mr  Fraser
    said that his partner was on blood thinning medication.  She  took  two
    or three different drugs for this.  There was no re-examination.

38. In his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Bramble submitted the appeal should be dismissed.  The couple not  show
    very significant obstacles to carrying on family life in Jamaica.   She
    had a son there, with whom she could make contact.  It  was  reasonable
    for the appellant to  apply  for  entry  clearance.   Mr  Fraser  could
    accompany her to Jamaica on a holiday, and then come back  here  if  he
    did not wish to stay  out  longer  while  the  decision  on  the  entry
    clearance application was awaited.  Applying  Chikwamba,  there  was  a
    good reason  to  require  the  appellant  to  go  back  to  seek  entry
    clearance, due to her adverse  immigration  history.   The  factors  in
    Section 117B required due consideration.  She had  been  an  overstayer
    since 1999, and she had established family life  with  Mr  Fraser  when
    present here unlawfully.  He reminded me that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge found at paragraph [38] that the claimant had been a  substantial
    drain on the NHS without contributing to  it  through  the  payment  of
    taxes.

39. In reply, Mr Jesurum conceded that  the  case  for  the  appellant  was
    weaker than it had been previously, as Mr Fraser's mother had  recently
    died, and therefore the need for Mr Fraser to act as a carer for her no
    longer existed.  Compelling circumstances were required for the Article
    8 claim to succeed outside the Rules, but such  circumstances  must  be
    considered cumulatively.  What made the circumstances  here  compelling
    were the length of the appellant's residence (eighteen years), the fact
    that they were an aged couple, the  appellant's  medical  difficulties,
    and the absence of family in the country of return.  The fact that  the
    Rules were not met was only the starting point, following Huang.

40.  Mr  Jesurum  submitted  that  the  formulation   of   the   compelling
    circumstances principle  in  SS  (Congo)  at  paragraph  [32]  was  per
    incuriam, as it was inconsistent with the statement of the law  by  the
    House of Lords in Huang at paragraphs [16] to [18].  He  accepted  that
    this was an argument for a higher court, and that I was bound  by  what
    the Court of Appeal had said in SS (Congo).

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

41. As submitted by Mr Jesurum, the Rules are "hard edged".  Mr  Fraser  is
    not a partner for the purposes of Appendix FM,  and  so  the  appellant
    cannot avail herself of the exemption criteria contained in EX.1.   But
    even if she could, there are not  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
    life being carried on in Jamaica.   I  accept  that  the  test  is  not
    whether there are literally insurmountable obstacles, but  whether  the
    hardship which the couple would encounter would be so severe as to meet
    the criteria set out in EX.2.  The evidence relied on does not disclose
    insurmountable obstacles as defined by EX.2.

42. There can be no doubt that questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test  should
    be answered in the appellant's favour with regard to the  establishment
    of family and private life in the United Kingdom.  Questions 3 and 4 of
    the Razgar test must be answered in favour of the Secretary  of  State,
    and so the crucial  issue  is  whether  the  proposed  interference  is
    proportionate.

43. I find that the couple face a reasonable choice, and that it is obvious
    which one they should take.  Option one is for  them  to  settle  as  a
    couple in Jamaica.  They will have each other for mutual  support,  but
    there will be a difficult period of adjustment for Mr Fraser,  who  may
    well struggle to find gainful employment at his age.  The appellant can
    revive her relationship with her son, and Mr Fraser can  reasonably  be
    expected to look to his family here for financial assistance  to  cover
    their maintenance and accommodation needs until at least  one  of  them
    finds  some  employment.   Option  two  is  far  more  attractive   and
    palatable.  This is the appellant going back to Jamaica to  seek  entry
    clearance.  Mr Fraser can accompany her, or join  her  for  a  holiday,
    while the entry clearance application is pending.  So  his  ability  to
    show that he is  earning  at  least  ï¿½18,600  per  annum  will  not  be
    compromised.  There is good reason to require the appellant to go  back
    to Jamaica to regularise her  status,  despite  the  inconvenience  and
    temporary interference of family life that this will entail.  For there
    is  strong  public  interest  in  requiring  immigration  offenders  to
    regularise their status by returning to their country of origin to make
    the appropriate application for entry clearance.  I  am  not  persuaded
    that are compelling circumstances which tip the balance the other  way.
    While the appellant is well integrated into UK society, due to her long
    residence here and to her fluency in  English,  little  weight  can  be
    attached to family life which is established whilst a  person's  status
    here is unlawful.

44. In  conclusion,  the  proposed  interference  strikes  a  fair  balance
    between, on the one hand, the rights and interests of the appellant and
    Mr Fraser, and, on the other hand, the wider interests of society.   It
    is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought  to  be  achieved,
    namely the maintenance of firm and effective immigration controls.
