Representation:

For the Appellant:         In person
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

     1. Funds are "available" to a claimant at the material  time  if  they
        belong to a third party but that party is shown to  be  willing  to
        deploy them to support the claimant for the purpose contemplated.
     2. Article 8 does  not  give  an  Immigration  Judge  a  free-standing
        liberty to depart from the Immigration Rules, and  it  is  unlikely
        that a person will be able to show an article 8 right by coming  to
        the UK for temporary purposes.  But a person  who  is  admitted  to
        follow a course that has not yet ended may build up a private  life
        that deserves respect, and the public interest  in  removal  before
        the end of  the  course  may  be  reduced  where  there  are  ample
        financial resources available.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1.    This appeal was heard on 23 July along with the appeal in the  case
      of FA and  AA  to  which  we  will  make  further  reference  in  this
      determination.


   2.   The appellant is a national of Brazil who had been granted leave  to
      enter the United Kingdom as a student on 30 July  2007  and  had  been
      granted extensions of stay until 31 October 2009. During  this  period
      she had been financially supported by two sponsors, Dr Rodgers and  Dr
      Carroll.

   3.   On 26 October 2009 she made an application for extension of stay  as
      a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the Points Based System.  The
      application was refused on 12 January 2010 because  it  was  concluded
      that she did not comply with Appendix  C  to  the  Immigration  Rules,
      concerned with  maintenance  and  available  funds.   Her  maintenance
      requirement was �2,695, but she had only �1,064.69 in her  account  on
      the date of application. She had provided a sponsorship letter from Dr
      Rodgers and Dr Carroll.  Under paragraph 117 of the UKBA Tier 4 Points
      Based System Policy Guidance a student could only rely on  money  held
      in a bank account in another person's name if the account was  in  the
      name of a parent or legal guardian and there was evidence to establish
      both the relationship and the fact that permission to  use  the  money
      was given.

   4.   The appellant appealed and the appeal was heard before IJ  Jones  at
      Newport on 18 March 2010.  The appellant relied on  a  statement  from
      the two doctors dated 25 January 2010 that included the following:

             "Had Ms de Silva's sponsors  been  privy  to  the  new  rules,
             suitable maintenance funds would have been made  available  to
             Ms de Silva and appeared  in  her  personal  bank  account  in
             accordance with the 'Maintenance funds' scoring system.


             Ms de Silva is now unable to complete her studies and take her
             examinations: firstly, the rules that allowed her  entry  into
             the UK to fulfil her educational aspirations have been revoked
             before completion of the said  course  and  examinations  and,
             secondly, the UK citizens previously deemed suitable  sponsors
             for an individual wishing to be educated  in  the  UK  are  no
             longer deemed suitable."


   5.   The IJ determined the appeal by applying the guidance and  concluded
      that the appellant could not meet the definition of  sponsor  in  that
      guidance and therefore the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(d) were not
      met.


   6.   The IJ went on to consider Article 8 and concluded that there was  a
      private life in the United Kingdom that would be adversely effected by
      the immigration decision so as to "potentially engage the operation of
      Article 8".  However, in considering the question  of  proportionality
      and striking a fair balance between the interests of the community and
      a well-established student who wished to complete her education in the
      UK, it was concluded that any interference was proportionate:

             "She has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph 245ZX  of
             the Immigration Rules. She also knew, as a student,  that  she
             was only permitted to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
             specific period of time. In all the circumstances, and  having
             regard  to the need for firm and fair immigration  control,  I
             find that the interference with the appellant's  private  life
             is not sufficiently serious and I find that Article 8  of  the
             European  Convention is not engaged".

   7.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by the  Vice-
      President on 8 July 2010 in the light of the decision of the Court  of
      Appeal in Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 719.


   8.    For reasons we have already given in the case of FA and AA  (above)
      we conclude that the decision in Pankina at [28], [29] and [33]  means
      that Policy Guidance that had not been laid before  Parliament  before
      the inception of the Points Based System cannot be relied  on  by  the
      Respondent as  a  source  of  additional  mandatory  requirements  not
      otherwise spelt out in the Immigration Rules themselves.   In  Pankina
      the migrant respondent had not complied with the  requirement  of  the
      Guidance to have had the requisite funds in the bank account for three
      months before the date of application.

   9.    Mr. Avery submitted, on instructions, that the decision in  Pankina
      was confined to the  dis-application  of  the  three  month  rule  and
      pointed to the conclusion on the  constitutional  issue  at  [37].  We
      cannot agree.  In our judgment the Court of Appeal  was  applying  the
      answers to the constitutional  questions  it  posed  at  [21]  to  the
      particular  provision  of  the  Policy  Guidance  that  had  led   the
      applicants to fail in their extension applications.  We  further  note
      that Foskett J concluded that Pankina was of wider application in  his
      judgment in English UK [2010] EWHC 1726 (Admin) at [74] to [77].

  10.  We are satisfied that  in  applying  the  guidance  as  a  source  of
      mandatory additional obligation as  to  the  identity  of  permissible
      sponsors the IJ erred in law.  We  set  aside  the  determination  and
      remake it for ourselves. There is no need to hear further evidence. We
      were informed that the appellant has continued to make  progress  with
      her studies and has been able to continue to maintain and  accommodate
      herself without recourse to public funds.

Compliance with Appendix C

  11.  HC 314 provided that with effect from  31 March 2009 Tier  4  General
      Students must score 10 points for funds and


        "10 points will only be awarded if the funds  shown  in  the  table
        below are available to the applicant and the applicant provides the
        specified documents to show this".

  12. We are satisfied from the evidence that Drs Rodgers and Carroll had  a
      combined income of over �300,000. They had the necessary resources  at
      the relevant time  and were willing to transfer  such  funds  as  were
      needed to ensure that the appellant met the  maintenance  requirements
      of the Immigration Rules were met, in this case some �1,631  to  bring
      the balance in the appellants account up to � 2,695.

  13.  In the absence of specific additional requirements of the Immigration
      Rules, it seems to us that funds are "available" to a claimant at  the
      material time if they belong to a third party but that party is  shown
      to be willing to deploy them to support the claimant for  the  purpose
      contemplated.  Gifts of money have always been acceptable for visitors
      who need to show they have resources available to them. The  need  for
      Immigration Rules to have unambiguous provisions  preventing  recourse
      to financial assistance  from  other  persons,  if  that  is  what  is
      intended, was spelt out in Mahad v ECO [2009] UKSC 16 [2010] 1 WLR  48
      at [26] to [30]. That decision was concerned with the maintenance  and
      accommodation  requirements  of  working  holiday  makers,   but   its
      implications go beyond this category of applicant.

  14.  Accordingly, we are satisfied on the facts  of  this  case  that  the
      appellant  had  sufficient  funds  "available"  to  her  to  meet  the
      objective requirements of Appendix C at the relevant  time.  The  word
      "available" can not be read restrictively to mean  "available  to  her
      with no assistance from any other person save a parent  or  guardian",
      by  reference  to  the  Policy  Guidance,  and  neither  can  such   a
      requirement be imported by the reference in the Immigration  Rules  to
      proving maintenance by relevant documents.

 Article 8

  15.  In case we are wrong on our construction of Appendix C, we will  also
      address Article 8 ECHR.


  16.  In Pankina,  Sedley LJ giving the  lead  judgment  in  the  Court  of
      Appeal recognised:
        1. "There appears to me, in this situation, to be  no  escape  from
           the proposition that in exercising her powers, whether within or
           outside the rules of practice for the time being in  force,  the
           Home Secretary must have regard and give effect  to  applicants'
           Convention rights. This will mean in most cases  evaluating  the
           extent and quality of their  family  and  private  life  in  the
           United Kingdom and the implications, both for them and  for  the
           United Kingdom, of truncating their careers here.
        1. That in turn will require consideration of the  significance  of
           the criteria by which their  eligibility  has  been  gauged  and
           found wanting. It is one thing to expect an  applicant  to  have
           the necessary academic and  linguistic  qualifications:  here  a
           miss is likely to be as good as a mile. It  is  another  for  an
           applicant to fall marginally or momentarily short of a financial
           criterion which in itself has no meaning: its significance is as
           a rough and ready measure of the applicant's ability to continue
           to live without reliance on public funds.  Having  �800  in  the
           bank, whether for three continuous months or simply at the  date
           of application, is no doubt some indication of this; but  people
           who are able to meet the test  may  fall  on  hard  times  after
           obtaining indefinite leave to remain, and  others  who  fail  it
           would, if allowed to remain, never become  a  charge  on  public
           funds. The Home Office has to exercise some common  sense  about
           this if it is not to  make  decisions  which  disproportionately
           deny respect to the private and family lives of graduates who by
           definition have  been  settled  here  for  some  years  and  are
           otherwise eligible for Tier  1  entry.  If  the  Home  Secretary
           wishes the rules to be black letter law, she  needs  to  achieve
           this by an established legislative route.
        1. So long as the rules are what the Immigration Act 1971 says they
           are, they must in my judgment be operated in conformity with s.6
           of the Human Rights Act."
   1. The House of Lords in the  case  of  Huang  had  also  considered  how
      Article 8  was  to  apply  to  people  who  had  failed  to  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules but who had a family life in the
      UK that required respect:
           "17. The authority will wish to  consider  and  weigh  all  that
           tells in favour of the refusal of  leave  which  is  challenged,
           with particular reference to justification under  article  8(2).
           There  will,  in   almost   any   case,   be   certain   general
           considerations to  bear  in  mind:  the  general  administrative
           desirability of applying known rules if a system of  immigration
           control is to be workable, predictable, consistent and  fair  as
           between  one  applicant  and  another;  the   damage   to   good
           administration and effective control if a system is perceived by
           applicants internationally to be unduly porous, unpredictable or
           perfunctory; the need to discourage  non-nationals  admitted  to
           the country temporarily from  believing  that  they  can  commit
           serious crimes and  yet  be  allowed  to  remain;  the  need  to
           discourage fraud, deception and deliberate breaches of the  law;
           and so on.
           18.  ... It is a premise of  the  statutory  scheme  enacted  by
           Parliament that an applicant may fail to qualify under the Rules
           and yet may have a valid claim by virtue of Article 8.
       19. In de Freitas v Permanent Secretary of Ministry of  Agriculture,
           Fisheries, Lands and Housing [1999]  1  AC  69,  80,  the  Privy
           Council, drawing  on  South  African,  Canadian  and  Zimbabwean
           authority, defined  the  questions  generally  to  be  asked  in
           deciding whether a measure is proportionate:
           "whether:  (i)  the  legislative   objective   is   sufficiently
           important to justify limiting  a  fundamental  right;  (ii)  the
           measures  designed  to  meet  the  legislative   objective   are
           rationally connected to it; and (iii) the means used  to  impair
           the right or freedom are no more than is necessary to accomplish
           the objective."
           This formulation has been widely cited and applied. But  counsel
           for the applicants (with the support of Liberty, in  a  valuable
           written  intervention)  suggested  that  the   formulation   was
           deficient in omitting reference  to  an  overriding  requirement
           which featured in the judgment of Dickson CJ in R v Oakes [1986]
           1 SCR 103, from which this approach to proportionality  derives.
           This feature is (p 139) the need to  balance  the  interests  of
           society with those of individuals and groups. This is indeed  an
           aspect which should never be overlooked or discounted. The House
           recognised as much in R (Razgar) v Secretary of  State  for  the
           Home Department [2004] UKHL 27, [2004] 2 AC  368,  paras  17-20,
           26, 27, 60, 77, when, having suggested  a  series  of  questions
           which an adjudicator would have to ask and answer in deciding  a
           Convention   question,   it   said   that   the   judgment    on
           proportionality
             "must always involve the striking of a  fair  balance  between
             the  rights  of  the  individual  and  the  interests  of  the
             community which is inherent in the whole  of  the  Convention.
             The severity and consequences of the  interference  will  call
             for careful assessment at this stage" (see para 20).
       20. In an article  8  case  where  this  question  is  reached,  the
           ultimate question for the  appellate  immigration  authority  is
           whether  the  refusal  of  leave  to   enter   or   remain,   in
           circumstances where the life of the family cannot reasonably  be
           expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking  full  account  of  all
           considerations weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudices the
           family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to
           amount to a breach of the fundamental right protected by article
           8. If the answer to this question is affirmative, the refusal is
           unlawful and the authority must so decide. It is  not  necessary
           that the appellate immigration authority, directing itself along
           the lines indicated  in  this  opinion,  need  ask  in  addition
           whether the case meets a test of exceptionality."
   2. It is apparent from these principles that Article 8 does not provide a
      general discretion in the IJ to  dispense  with  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules merely because  the  way  that  they  impact  in  an
      individual case may appear to be unduly harsh. The present context  is
      not respect for family life that can in certain circumstances  require
      admission to or extension of stay within the United Kingdom  of  those
      who do not comply with the general Immigration Rules.  It is difficult
      to imagine how the private life of someone with no prior nexus to  the
      United Kingdom would require  admission  outside  the  rules  for  the
      purpose of study. There is no  human  right  to  come  to  the  United
      Kingdom for education or other purposes of truly voluntary migration.


   3.  However, the appellant has been admitted to the UK for the purpose of
      higher education and has made progress enabling extension of  stay  in
      that capacity since her admission in 2007.  We acknowledge  that  that
      gives no right or expectation of extension of stay irrespective of the
      provisions of the Immigration  Rules  at  the  time  of  the  relevant
      decision on extension.

   4.  Nevertheless people who have been admitted on a course of study at  a
      recognised UK institution for higher education, are likely to build up
      a relevant connection with the course, the institution, an educational
      sequence for the ultimate professional qualification sought,  as  well
      as social ties during the  period  of  study.  Cumulatively  this  may
      amount to private life that deserves respect because  the  person  has
      been admitted for this purpose,  the  purpose  remains  unfilled,  and
      discretionary factors such as mis-representation or  criminal  conduct
      have not provided grounds for refusal of extension or  curtailment  of
      stay.

   5.  In the present case a change in  the  sponsorship  rules  during  the
      course of a period of study has had a serious effect on the ability of
      the appellant to conclude her course of study.  Some  requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules or applicable public policy  scheme  may  be  of
      such importance that a miss is as good as a  mile,  but  this  is  not
      always the case.

   6.  The points-based system aims to provide objective criteria  for  what
      funds are needed to be demonstrated before an  extension  of  stay  is
      granted.  If we are wrong on  our  first  conclusion,  we  shall  here
      assume that it may also  set  strict  criteria  as  to  how  such  the
      availability of such funds is to be demonstrated and in whose accounts
      the funds may be. But where the appellant establishes by evidence that
      she has funds available to support her if needed, the strength of  the
      public interest  in  refusing  her  an  extension  based  on  somewhat
      arbitrary provisions of guidance attached to an appendix to the rules,
      is in our judgment somewhat less than the failure to  meet  a  central
      requirement of the Rules.

   7.  But  even  central  requirements  are  not   determinative   if   the
      countervailing claim is of sufficient weight. Mrs Huang could not meet
      the dependant relative rules because she had not reached  the  minimum
      age required, but nevertheless the  particular  circumstances  of  her
      history required the strength of her family  life  to  be  taken  into
      account. Sedley LJ in  Pankina  contemplated  that  some  points-based
      claimants may not meet the minimum funding requirements  for  a  short
      period due to unforeseen circumstances.

   8. Here the same sponsors who ensured that the appellant  had  sufficient
      funds at the  beginning  of  her  course  were  available  with  ample
      financial support to ensure that she met the substantive  requirements
      of Appendix C in order to continue with her  studies.   If  minds  had
      been applied to the  problem  the  necessary  funds  could  have  been
      transferred to her account so both the letter and the purpose  of  the
      Policy Guidance was met.

   9. In our judgment, the application  to  this  appellant  of  the  Policy
      Guidance that prevented her from obtaining the extension at  the  time
      and in  the  circumstances  set  out  above,  was  a  disproportionate
      interference with private life that deserved respect as  long  as  she
      continued to meet  the  other  requirements  of  the  Rules  and  make
      appropriate progress in her course of studies here.

  10. We would accordingly have allowed her appeal on this basis as well.
