                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination  of  Fist-tier
    Tribunal Judge Quinn promulgated  on  16  November  2017  in  which  he
    allowed the appeal of Mr  [A]  on  all  grounds;  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection, Articles 2, 3 and 8.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals  against  that  determination.  For  the
    purposes of continuity, I shall refer to Mr [A] as the appellant as  he
    was in the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Sudan who was born on [ ] 2000.   He  was
    17� at the date of the hearing and was just over 17� when the  material
    decision was  made  on  15th  September  2017.   The  claim  which  the
    appellant advanced was set out principally in his witness statement  at
    pages A2, A3 and A4 and, in that statement, he alleged that  he  was  a
    child at the time he was recruited by the  Sudanese  Army  and  he  was
    taken away by soldiers, held for two  months,  taught  how  to  parade.
    That was in breach of the Sudanese government's own rules  in  relation
    to  recruitment  because,  whilst  the   Sudanese   has   conscription,
    conscription is limited to Sudanese citizens between the ages of 18 and
    33.  He claims that, at the age of 14, when he was not of the  official
    draft age, he was taken away and held by soldiers and  forced  to  take
    part in military activities.  It  is  said  however  that  he  suffered
    injuries and that he was admitted to hospital and  that  following  his
    discharge from hospital the army continued to take an interest  in  him
    and, as a result of that, he is at risk of persecution from  the  army.
    He alleged that it is clear that armed groups including the  government
    forces  and  government  aligned  militia  continue  to  recruit  child
    soldiers.  That was  something  that  the  judge  referred  to  in  his
    determination.  He said at paragraph 27 child  soldiers  did  exist  in
    Africa and it was possible that the appellant had been recruited to the
    army.  He may have looked older than his true age.

 4. I remind myself that I have to apply the lower standard of proof.   The
    reference to child soldiers existing in Africa in general does  not  of
    course assist the appellant in this appeal because we  know  that  each
    country has to be looked  at  individually.   It  does  not  assist  an
    appellant merely to say that there  are  other  countries  where  child
    soldiers exist.

 5. The evidence in relation  to  Sudan  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was contained in the US State Department Country Reports
    on Human Rights Practices for 2016.  This was extracted at page  75  of
    the bundle which says in these terms under the heading Child Soldiers:

         "The  law  prohibits  the  recruitment  of  children  and  provides
         criminal  penalties  for   perpetrators.   Allegations   persisted,
         however, that armed movements, government forces,  and  government-
         aligned militias had child soldiers within their ranks.

         According to several reports, the government provided material  and
         logistical support in the country to  the  South  Sudan  opposition
         group, Sudan People's Liberation  Army  in  Opposition,  which  was
         widely reported to recruit and use child soldiers."
    That does not in my judgment support the view that  the  government  of
    Sudan widely recruits child soldiers.  That is  made  clear  from  what
    thereafter follows and where it is said during the 27 March to 30 March
    visit of the UN special representative for children and armed conflict,
    the government signed an action plan to end and prevent recruitment and
    use of children by the security  forces.   The  special  representative
    documented 21 children detained by NISS since April and August 2015 for
    their alleged association with the rebel group JEM.  The  children  had
    allegedly been recruited in South Kordofan and South Sudan and used  in
    combat in Darfur and South Sudan.  However,  the  government  expressly
    denied allegations that it recruited or used child soldiers within  its
    armed forces.  The background information therefore  does  not  support
    the general proposition that the government uses  child  soldiers.   At
    any rate the evidence is equivocal and consequently it had to be looked
    at with a degree of caution by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  when  he
    was considering that claim.
    It is clear that he did not accept the appellant's own  evidence  about
    these events.  He said in paragraph 28:

         "I did not accept the Appellant was a person of special interest to
         the army and neither did I  accept  that  they  had  made  repeated
         visits to find him following his release  from  hospital.   If  the
         army were looking for the Appellant it was logical that  he  should
         not return home."
 6. In paragraph 29 however it is said.

         "The Appellant's account was plausible, namely  that  it  had  been
         abandoned by the army because of his injuries.  Thereafter  he  had
         been treated in hospital and discharged home."
    That it seems to me is an indication that the judge did not accept that
    the army was showing any continued  interest  in  the  appellant.   The
    determination continues however,

         "Thereafter there were attempts to put him back into the army."
    That phrase seems to sit uncomfortably with  what  the  judge  said  in
    paragraph 28 that he did not  accept  that  the  authorities  had  made
    repeated attempts to visit him following his release from hospital.  If
    follows that it is not at all clear the  basis  upon  which  the  judge
    reached the conclusion that the appellant was at risk of being forcibly
    recruited into the army as a result of his age.

 7. The judge relied upon page 75 of the report, to which I have  referred,
    as lending support to the  appellant's  contention  that  he  had  been
    recruited by the army as a child soldier, but it is clear to me that on
    a proper reading of the background material contained in the  US  State
    Department Report that this is not what the report is saying.

 8. The judge goes on to say, dealing  with  page  76  of  the  appellant's
    bundle, that there were references to the reports of the use  of  child
    soldiers by SPLM-N and this lent credence to the appellant's  statement
    that was in fear of persecution.   In  my  judgment  that  cannot  lead
    credence to that.  He has never suggested that he had  been  approached
    by the SPLM-N for the purposes of acting as a child soldier.  There  is
    no suggestion that he lives in an area which is under  the  control  of
    the SPLM-N or that they would have the ability to persecute  him.   Nor
    is there a suggestion that, were he to return to the capital, he  would
    be similarly at risk of the SPLM-N.  The judge's reliance upon the fact
    that a militia opposition group dealing with opposition in South Sudan,
    although located in Sudan  itself,  recruits  child  soldiers,  is  not
    evidence that the appellant's claim is more or less  credible  that  he
    was forcibly recruited as a child soldier by the Sudanese  authorities.
    Consequently, I do not consider that the judge's reasoning in  relation
    to the core of the appellant's claim is sustainable.   The  judge  then
    goes on to find that the asylum claim has been made out.  He also finds
    that he succeeds in humanitarian protection (an alternative  claim  but
    only available when asylum fails).   He  then  goes  on  to  deal  with
    Articles 2 and 3.

 9. It is said that the appellant would face significant difficulties if he
    were returned to Sudan.  He would have no  livelihood  and  nowhere  to
    return to and no support mechanism in place.  The judge  found  he  was
    undoubtedly likely to face destitution and possible starvation.   That,
    it seems to me, is made on the basis of the  claim  that  he  has  been
    forcibly recruited as a child solider by the Sudanese authorities.   It
    does hold up to examination if that part of the  determination  is  set
    aside.  For these reasons, I find that there was an error of law.  None
    of the findings in relation to Articles 2, 3 and 8 can  properly  stand
    independently of the finding made by the judge that the  appellant  was
    at risk of persecution by the Sudanese authorities.

10. In those circumstances, I direct that the case will require  re-making.
    It seems to me that the re-making is a root and branch task that  needs
    proper findings of fact made on all issues, in which case I  direct  it
    goes back to the First-tier Tribunal.
