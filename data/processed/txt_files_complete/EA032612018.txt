For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Jones Whyte,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant applied on 20 December 2017  for  a  permanent  residence
    card as the former family member of an EEA national  exercising  treaty
    rights in the UK who has retained a right of residence.

 2. The respondent refused that  application  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
    detailed letter dated 19 March 2018.   The  letter  sets  out  why  the
    evidence provided is considered inadequate,  and  what  the  respondent
    would expect to  see  if  the  appellant  were  to  apply  again.   The
    appellant did not take that route, but appealed to the FtT.

 3. In his decision promulgated on 12 February 2019, FtT Judge Farrelly  at
    paragraph 25 was "not satisfied that  the  appellant  has  demonstrated
    that his former wife was exercising treaty  rights  as  required",  and
    dismissed the appeal.

 4. The grounds of appeal to the Ut are as follows:

         "1.       At  [19  -  22]  the  judge  highlights  papers  provided
         confirming self-employment. The judge then goes on  to  mention  at
         [24] "it is difficult to see how on the figures presented the self-
         employment was meaningful and how she sustained herself". The judge
         has used the incorrect test. The cases of D M Levin v  S  (C-53/81)
         and Kempf v S (C-139/85) both concerned very low earnings, and both
         succeeded. In Levin the issue had been whether earnings  below  the
         level considered necessary to support a person would count and they
         did. On the facts of Levin, the claimant had alternative  resources
         available. In Kempf, the claimant did not have  alternative  income
         and claimed benefits at the same time as working because his income
         was so low.

         2. The appellant had provided documents which have not  been  taken
         into consideration  by  the  judge.  At  [25]  the  judge  has  not
         considered or, at the very least, not provided  the  reasoning  why
         the evidence before him should not be taken into account."

 5. On 21 March 2019  FTT  Judge  Osborne  granted  permission,  for  these
    reasons:

         "... In an otherwise careful decision it is at least arguable  that
         in requiring the self-employment of the  European  national  to  be
         "meaningful" at [24], the judge applied the wrong test.

         As this arguable error of law has been identified, all grounds  are
         arguable."

 6. The points which I noted from the submissions by Mr Winter were these:

      i) It was an error to ask at  [24]  whether  the  self-employment  was
         meaningful.  The question should have been whether it  was  genuine
         and effective.

     ii) At [19 - 23], the judge conflated the issues.

    iii) The decision  could  not  be  saved  by  equating  "meaningful"  to
         "genuine and effective", because the evidence narrated clearly  did
         meet the test in Levin at [13, 16, & 17] reiterated in Kemp at  [13
         - 15].

     iv) The point intended by ground 2 was that at [25] the judge was wrong
         to rely on gaps in the employment history, as by  piecing  together
         the periods of employment accepted in the refusal letter  with  the
         evidence in the appellant's FtT inventory, there was no gap.

      v) It was accepted  that  no  schedule  had  been  provided,  but  the
         evidence was clear.

     vi) The decision of the FtT should be reversed.

 7. Mr Whitwell submitted thus:

      i) The term "meaningful" at [24] might not be the best choice, but  in
         context of the decision as a whole, and [19 -  23]  in  particular,
         the judge had effectively  found  the  self-employment  not  to  be
         genuine and effective.

     ii) The earnings over the 4  years  referred  to  at  [19  -  23]  were
         erratic, and over the period came to about �33 per week.  That  was
         no more than marginal and ancillary, in the language  of  the  case
         law, and the judge was entitled to find  it  not  meaningful.   The
         exact phrase used did not matter.

    iii) It was notable that the evidence of late filing of a tax return and
         of a subsequent demand  dated  from  just  after  the  respondent's
         decision, and there was no evidence the tax assessed had been paid.

     iv) The decision should stand.

 8. Mr Winter said in reply:

      i) The point about the timing of the tax return had not been  made  in
         the FtT, and came too late.

     ii) The level of earnings in Levin had been similar, about �30 per week

    iii) On the correct test, the decision fell to be reversed on  ground  1
         alone, even if ground 2 was not made out.

 9. I reserved my decision.

10. I deal firstly with ground 2.

11. The respondent's decision makes clear sense in setting out what  is  to
    be looked for in establishing a case of this nature.

12. The appellant's response was in  his  statement,  item  2  of  his  FtT
    bundle, the further documents in that bundle, and in his oral evidence.
     I am unable to accept the submission  that  it  was  clear  from  that
    evidence that the gaps had been filled.  The  respondent  continued  to
    submit at the hearing that they had not.  It was for the  appellant  to
    supply a precise chronology, indexed to the evidence, with figures,  to
    establish the contrary.  It was not for the judge to extricate his case
    from 29 items in an 89-page bundle.

13. It is still not made apparent that there was such a case to be found.

14. Apart from that, parts of the explanations tendered were weak, such  as
    the presentation of late tax returns, as commented on by the  judge  at
    [24].

15. The second ground of appeal is far too vague.  It persists in the error
    of failing to specify what the appellant's case was, and passing to the
    judge a task which was his.

16. I am also unable to uphold the submission that ground 1 would be enough
    on its own.  Without any clear presentation of how and when the sponsor
    had been exercising her treaty rights, any error over the legal test is
    immaterial.

17. All that ground 1 takes from the case law  is  that  other  cases  have
    succeeded where earnings were low.  That does not amount to a rule that
    all cases where income is low, without more, demonstrate  the  exercise
    of treaty rights and entitlement to a residence card.

18. Levin at [16] shows that economic  activity  may  suffice  although  it
    falls below what is regarded as the minimum for  subsistence,  or  less
    than the minimum wage, but must not be "of such small  degree  that  it
    appears to be merely minimal and subsidiary"; freedom  of  movement  is
    guaranteed only to those who "perform or wish to perform an activity of
    an economic nature"; and finally, at [18],  income  may  be  below  the
    minimum for subsistence set in the member state so long as it is  "real
    and actual work in paid employment".

19. Kempf,  as  Mr  Winter  said,  confirms  but  does  not  add  to  those
    principles.

20.  The  term  "meaningful"  does  not  appear  to  me   to   be   clearly
    distinguishable from "genuine and effective".  I have been referred  to
    no authority that to use any term other than the  latter  is,  in  this
    context, a legal error.

21. Decisions must be read fairly and as a whole.  The respondent  did  not
    say that the sponsor had not engaged in economic activity, but  refused
    the application because it was at a low level, and not shown  to  cover
    the whole period.  The appellant  did  not  clarify  exactly  what  the
    activity amounted to, and when.  This was a case around the borderline.
    I could not say  that  the  appellant's  case  is  impossible  ever  to
    establish.  However, ground 1 does not show that the judge's conclusion
    that he had failed to do so, on his presentation to the  FtT,  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law, such that it  should  be  set
    aside.

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

23. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
