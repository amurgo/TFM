Where an ECO refuses entry clearance solely in reliance  upon  a  ground  in
para 320 of HC 395 and the immigration judge concludes that the ground  does
not apply, subject  to  the  requirements  of  fairness,  the  judge  should
proceed to determine the appeal under the substantive  rule  which  was  the
basis for the Appellant's original application.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on  7  May  1986.
    On 3 October 2006 she applied for entry clearance to come to the United
    Kingdom to undertake a three year BA (Hons) in Tourism and  Hospitality
    at the London East Bank College  in  Aldgate,  London.   The  Appellant
    submitted  a  number  of  documents  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    including a number of supporting financial documents which she  claimed
    were bank statements relating to her uncle who was  her  sponsor.   The
    Appellant  was  not  interviewed.    On  the  basis   of   a   document
    verification report, the ECO concluded that he was not  satisfied  that
    the Appellant was related to the sponsor as claimed and that  therefore
    she had submitted a false document in support of her application  which
    he then refused exclusively on that basis.  Consequently, on 15 October
    2006 the ECO refused her application under paragraph 320(21) of HC 395.
     The ECO did not consider the  application  to  the  Appellant  of  the
    substantive student rule, namely para 57 of HC 395.

 2. The Appellant appealed and,  following  a  hearing,  Immigration  Judge
    Markham David having considered the evidence before him found that  the
    Appellant and sponsor were indeed related as claimed and that therefore
    paragraph 320(21) of HC 395 did not apply  to  the  Appellant.   Having
    done so, the Judge went  on  to  consider  whether  the  Appellant  was
    entitled to entry clearance under the Immigration  Rules.    The  Judge
    allowed the appeal and directed that the appropriate entry clearance be
    granted.   Upon  the  respondent's  application,  reconsideration   was
    ordered by Senior Immigration Judge Chalkley on 1 June 2007 and so  the
    matter comes before us.

 3. The Appellant's representatives, Bucks Solicitors were not  present  at
    the hearing before us and they remained so  despite  a  telephone  call
    being placed to them when they confirmed that they were  aware  of  the
    date of the hearing.  There being no good reason for their absence,  we
    considered it proper to exercise our discretion to hear the  appeal  in
    their absence under rule 19(1) of the 2005 Procedure Rules.

 4. Mr Tarlow, who  represented  the  Respondent,  did  not  challenge  the
    Judge's decision in relation to para 320(21).   However,  he  submitted
    that the Immigration Judge, having found in the Appellant's  favour  in
    respect of para 320(21) of HC  395  should  not  have  dealt  with  the
    substantive merits of the Appellant's application under para 57  of  HC
    395.  Instead, the Judge should only have allowed  the  appeal  to  the
    extent that the Appellant's application remained outstanding before the
    ECO.

 5. The governing legislative  provisions  are  s  86(3)  and  (5)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which provide that:

      "(3) The Tribunal must allow the appeal in so far as it thinks that  -


            a) a decision against which the appeal is brought or is treated
               as  being  brought  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
               (including immigration rules), or

            b) a discretion exercised in making a  decision  against  which
               the appeal is brought or is treated as being brought  should
               have been exercised differently.

             ...

        (5) In so far as subsection (3) does not apply, the Tribunal  shall
        dismiss the appeal."

 6. In CP (Section 86 (3) and (5); Wrong Immigration Rule) Dominica  [2006]
    UKAIT 00040 the Tribunal considered what was the  proper  approach,  in
    the light of these provisions, where an Immigration Judge decided  that
    the original decision-maker had applied the wrong rule.  There  it  was
    submitted on behalf of the respondent, rather as in this  appeal,  that
    the correct  approach  was  to  allow  the  appeal  as  being  not  "in
    accordance with the law" and for the application to be reconsidered  by
    the respondent under the correct rule.   The  Tribunal  disagreed.   It
    accepted that where the wrong rule had been applied the  appeal  should
    at least be allowed to the extent that it was "not in  accordance  with
    the law" but the Judge  should  go  further.   At  paragraph  [18]  the
    Tribunal set out the correct approach as follows:

      "...once the  correct  Rule  is  identified,  it  is  the  Immigration
        Judge's obligation to apply that Rule, subject to the  requirements
        of  fairness, so that the parties have a proper opportunity to deal
        with the relevant evidential and other issues that arise."

 7. The Tribunal continued at paragraph [19]:

      "If the Appellant succeeds on the evidence  under  the  correct  Rule,
        the appeal will, of course, be  allowed  in  substance  not  merely
        because the original decision was  legally  defective  having  been
        made under the wrong Rule."

 8. In principle, we consider that approach is equally applicable where the
    decision-maker wrongly applied (in the view of the Judge)  a  provision
    such as paragraph 320(21) and then failed to consider  the  substantive
    rule.  Subject to the requirements of fairness, the  Immigration  Judge
    should proceed to decide the case under the  substantive  rule  on  the
    evidence presented at the hearing.

 9. Of course, as the Tribunal made  clear  in  CP  the  Immigration  Judge
    should not proceed if it would be unfair to  do  so.    This  may  well
    arise in an out  of  country  case  where,  through  no  fault  of  the
    Appellant, the Respondent has retained relevant documentation submitted
    with the application which cannot therefore be presented at the hearing
    of the appeal.  We do not, however, consider  that  it  is  necessarily
    unfair to proceed simply because one of the parties is not  represented
    at the hearing.  It is the obligation of the parties  to  present  such
    evidence and make such submissions as they  wish  in  relation  to  the
    appeal before the Tribunal.  Both the Appellant and Respondent will  be
    on notice that if the Judge takes the view  that  a  provision  in  the
    Rules such as para 320 does not apply to the Appellant,  the  Judge  is
    entitled to proceed to determine the appeal under the substantive  rule
    which was the basis for the Appellant's original application.

10. In order to succeed in the appeal outright on the substantive rule, the
    Appellant must satisfy the Judge on each and every  requirement  within
    the Rule.  Failure to do so on any part of the Rule will result in  the
    appeal being dismissed.  However, if the  Immigration  Judge  considers
    that only some of the requirements of the Rule can be  dealt  with,  he
    may well then be correct only to look at those requirements and to make
    findings in relation to them.  If his findings are all in favour of the
    Appellant, the appeal will be allowed to that extent with  a  direction
    that the decision-maker should continue  to  consider  the  Appellant's
    application in accordance with the findings made by the Judge:  see  RM
    (Kwok On Tong:  HC 395 para 320) India [2006] UKAIT 00039 at [11].

11. Turning to the current  appeal,  it  is  clear  that  the  grounds  for
    reconsideration cannot succeed.  The Judge did not err in law  when  he
    considered the application of para 57 to the Appellant  having  reached
    the conclusion that the Entry Clearance Officer  was  wrong  to  decide
    that para 320(21)  applied.   It  was  the  Appellant's  obligation  to
    present evidence in order to discharge the burden of  proof  upon  her.
    The Appellant was represented and had submitted a bundle of evidence in
    support of the appeal.  In these circumstances, we see  no  conceivable
    basis for saying that it was unfair to determine the substantive issue.



12. Nevertheless, the Judge's decision cannot stand.  The Judge allowed the
    appeal and directed that entry clearance be granted.  He could only  do
    this if the evidence satisfied him that all the requirement of para  57
    were met.

13. Paragraph 57 is in the following terms:

      "The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave  to  enter  the
         United Kingdom as a student are that he:

         (i)      has been accepted for a course of study  which  is  to  be
             provided  by  an  organisation  which  is  included   on   the
             Department for Education and Skills' Register of Education and
             Training Providers, and is at either:

             (a)  a  publicly  funded  institution  of  further  or  higher
                  education; or

             (b) a bona fide private education institution which  maintains
                  satisfactory records of enrolment and attendance; or

             (c) an independent fee paying school  outside  the  maintained
                  sector; and

         (ii)     is able and intends to follow either:

             (a) a recognised full-time degree course at a publicly  funded
                  institution of further or higher education; or

             (b) a weekday  full-time  course  involving  attendance  at  a
                  single institution for a minimum  of  15  hours  organised
                  daytime study per week of a single  subject,  or  directly
                  related subjects; or

             (c) a full-time course of study at an independent  fee  paying
                  school; and

         (iii)    if under the age of 16 years is enrolled at an independent
             fee paying school on a full-time course of studies which meets
             the requirements of the Education Act 1944; and

         (iv)     intends to leave the United Kingdom  at  the  end  of  his
             studies; and

         (v)       does  not  intend  to  engage  in  business  or  to  take
             employment, except part time or vacation work undertaken  with
             the consent of the Secretary of State for Employment; and

         (vi)     is able to meet the costs of his course and  accommodation
             and the maintenance of  himself  and  any  dependants  without
             taking employment or engaging in business or  having  recourse
             to public funds."

14. The Judge's reasons for allowing the appeal outright  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs [11] and [12] of his determination as follows:

      "11.  The  respondent  has  said  that  he  has  not  considered  this
        application under any of the other provisions  of  the  Immigration
        Rules.  In this case I shall do so now.  In my view  the  sponsor's
        bank statement, which I am satisfied is genuine, show that  he  has
        ample funds to maintain the appellant for the duration  of  her  BA
        course.  I note that �2,500 has already been paid, which in my view
        is always a matter of some significance.  It is highly relevant  to
        the appellant's intention to follow the course, because if she gets
        to the United Kingdom and then says she does  not  wish  to  study,
        that money is not recoverable.  It is only recoverable if she fails
        to get a visa.  The payment of  such  a  sum  in  advance  is  also
        relevant to the sponsor's willingness and ability to pay.

        12.  I am quite satisfied that the appellant is able and intends to
        follow the proposed course.   There  is  no  evidential  basis  for
        coming to any different conclusion.  This is a genuine  application
        to study in the UK, and the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
        have been met."

15. We are left in no doubt that the brief excursus into the  evidence  and
    the reasoning in paras [11] and [12] that the Judge gave to  reach  the
    conclusion that the requirements of para 57 (at any rate those that  he
    mentions) were met, are legally inadequate.

16. Paragraph 57(ii) requires that the Appellant  establish  that  she  "is
    able and intends" to follow the degree course upon which she  had  been
    accepted.  There is no evidential basis for the Judge's conclusion that
    the Appellant is "able" to follow the proposed course.    The  evidence
    (such that there was before him) is barely referred to beyond the  bank
    statements.  Whilst the Judge was entitled to accept that  the  payment
    of the deposit for the course was some  evidence  of  an  intention  to
    follow it, standing alone (and he  refers  to  no  other  evidence)  it
    cannot properly bear the weight he places on it to  make  the  positive
    finding in the Appellant's favour.  It can, however, have no  relevance
    to the issue of the Appellant's ability to follow the course.  But even
    if that were not so, fatal to his decision to allow the appeal outright
    is the fact that he made  no  finding  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
    requirement in para 57(iv), namely that she intends to leave the United
    Kingdom at the end of her studies.   An  appeal  can  only  be  allowed
    outright if all the requirements of the Immigration Rules are met  (see
    RM).  For these reasons, the Judge materially  erred  in  law  and  his
    decision to allow the appeal cannot stand.

17. We must, therefore, substitute our own decision.  The  evidence  before
    us is identical to that which was before the Judge.  The Appellant, and
    those representing her, have not filed any additional evidence for  the
    reconsideration.  It is rather limited.  We have a bundle of  documents
    relating to the Appellant's application and in particular  in  relation
    to the issue of whether she was indeed related to the  sponsor  as  she
    claimed.   The  latter,  of  course,  is  no  longer  an  issue.    The
    Appellant's  own  witness  statement  date  19  May  2007   is   almost
    exclusively concerned  with  establishing  her  relationship  with  the
    sponsor.  The exception is paragraph [9] of that  statement  where  she
    says as follows:

      "I have strong family, social and economic ties  with  Bangladesh  and
        the United Kingdom.  I  have  excellent  academic  backgrounds  and
        qualifications.   I  have  a  better  prospect  if   I   obtain   a
        qualification form (sic) UK.  I am genuinely seeking entry to  take
        a course of study in the UK".

18. We also have the Appellant's visa application form in  which  she  sets
    out the course she intends to follow which is  supported  by  a  letter
    from the London East Bank College dated 12  September  2006  confirming
    that she has been accepted by  that  institution  on  the  BA(Hons)  in
    Tourism and Hospitality course for three years commencing on 23 October
    2006.  The course fees are noted there and also  it  is  noted  that  a
    deposit was paid of �2,500.

19. The Appellant's application  provides  some  further  evidence  of  her
    intentions.  In answer to questions posed there she states that the  UK
    course  and  its  subject-matter  have  value  throughout   the   world
    especially in Bangladesh.  On completion she says that she will  return
    to Bangladesh where it will benefit her to  obtain  a  good  job.   She
    states that the costs of the course, accommodation  and  other  matters
    will be about �9,910 per year.  She acknowledges that  English  is  not
    her first language but that she has completed a three month long course
    from International Language Academy.

20. The financial statements  of  the  Appellant's  uncle  include  a  bank
    statement covering the period 1 January 2006 to 19 September 2006.   It
    shows an opening balance of  919.37  Taka  and  a  closing  balance  of
    3,009,083.12 Taka.  There is a letter  of  support  for  the  sponsor's
    financial position dated 19 September 2006 from  the  Dhaka  Bank  Ltd.
    There is also a notarised affidavit from the sponsor attesting  to  his
    financial support for the Appellant.

21. In relation to the Appellant's course, taken at face value  the  letter
    of acceptance from the London East Bank College dated 12 September 2006
    shows that the Appellant has been enrolled  on  the  degree  course  in
    Tourism and Hospitality at that institution.  We know no more, however,
    about the institution or the course than can be seen from the  face  of
    that  letter.    As   we   have   noted,   the   Appellant   (and   her
    representatives) have not  filed  any  additional  supporting  evidence
    despite the terms of the Tribunal's reconsideration notice.

22. In relation to the issue of whether the Appellant is "able"  to  follow
    the course as required  by  para  57(ii),  we  note  that  her  English
    qualifications in Bangladesh were, apparently, thought insufficient and
    so  she  undertook  a  three  month  course  English  language  course.
    However, the Appellant did not provide any supporting documentation  in
    respect of that course which she claimed in  her  application  she  had
    undertaken, presumably in order to  enable  her  to  study  the  degree
    course in English.

23. In our view, taking what limited evidence we have before us as a  whole
    the appeal cannot succeed as the Appellant has  not  established  on  a
    balance of probabilities that the requirements of para 57(i)  and  (ii)
    were met at the date of decision.  For this reason  alone,  the  appeal
    must be dismissed.  We need say no more in relation to the evidence  as
    it relates to the remaining requirements of para 57.

Decision

24. For  these  reasons,  the  Immigration  Judge's  decision  discloses  a
    material error of law and  cannot  stand.   We  substitute  a  decision
    dismissing the appeal on the basis that the  Appellant  has  failed  to
    establish that she met all the requirements of  para  57,  namely  para
    57(i) and (ii) of HC 395 at the date of decision.
