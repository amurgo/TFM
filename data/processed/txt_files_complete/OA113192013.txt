Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Harrison (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Miss Evans (legal Representative)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant, born April 15, 1963,  is  a  citizen  of  Argentina.  On
    January 16, 2013 she applied for entry clearance as  the  spouse  of  a
    person settled in the United Kingdom.

 3. The respondent refused her application on April 25, 2013 as she was not
    satisfied:

     a. The  appellant  and  sponsor  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
        relationship (Section E-ECP 2.6 and 2.10 of Appendix FM).
     b. The appellant and sponsor satisfied the financial  requirements  of
        the Immigration Rules (Section E-ECP 3.1 of Appendix FM).
     c. The English language requirements of the Rules were met (Section E-
        ECP 4.1 of Appendix FM)

 4. On May 20, 2013 the appellant  appealed  under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The  respondent  reviewed
    the original decision and  whilst  accepting  the  parties  were  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship she maintained  her  objections  on
    the other grounds.

 5. The matter was listed before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Hague
    (hereinafter referred to as "the FtTJ") on March  26,  2014  and  in  a
    determination promulgated on April 10, 2014 he refused the appeal under
    the Immigration Rules but allowed the appeal under article 8 ECHR.

 6. The respondent appealed that decision on May 13,  2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fisher  on  June
    20, 2014. He found the FtTJ may have erred for the reasons set  out  in
    the grounds but also noted the FtTJ had applied the wrong provisions of
    the 2002 Act when considering what evidence could be admitted.

 7. The appellant's Rule 24 response dated  July  7,  2014  challenged  the
    respondent's grounds of appeal and also cross-appealed on the basis the
    FtTJ had applied the wrong test when considering what  evidence  should
    be admitted and submitted the FtTJ had erred by refusing to  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 8. Mr Harrison addressed me on his grounds of appeal  and  invited  me  to
    find an error of law. However,  I  raised  with  him  the  point  about
    Section 85A(3) of the 2002 Act and in particular paragraph [8]  of  the
    FtTJ's determination. It was clear the FtTJ had applied section  85A(3)
    which only applied to PBS applications. This appeal was a spouse  entry
    clearance application and was governed solely by Section 85(5)  of  the
    same act. Mr Harrison agreed  that  the  FtTJ  erred  when  stating  in
    paragraph [8] that the relevant date was the date of application and he
    accepted that if the appellant satisfied  the  Rules  at  the  date  of
    decision (after consideration  of  any  relevant  documents  admissible
    under DR (ECO): Post Decision Evidence (Morocco)  [2005]  UKIAT  00038)
    then the FtTJ would have erred in refusing the  application  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 9. I stood the matter down for the representatives  to  consider  all  the
    documents before the FtTJ. After a short break  Mr  Harrison  confirmed
    that he was satisfied the appellant met the Immigration Rules and  that
    all the specified evidence in Appendix FM-SE had been before  the  FtTJ
    at the hearing date.

10. Mr Harrison accepted the appellant's appeal should be allowed under the
    Immigration Rules. He indicated he did not intend to pursue his  appeal
    and he applied under Rule 17(1)(b) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 to withdraw his appeal. I agreed to this request.

11. For the avoidance of doubt I am satisfied:

     a. The  appellant  and  sponsor  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
        relationship.
     b. They had provided all the specified documents in Appendix FM-SE and
        had demonstrated the sponsor earned over ï¿½18,600.
     c. The appellant had the appropriate English language certificate.

    DECISION


12. There is a material error of law and I set aside the original  decision
    in respect of the Immigration Rules.


13. I have remade the decision under the Immigration Rules and I allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and I direct the appellant be issued
    with the appropriate visa.

14. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
