                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by LKW, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Poland,  born  on  25  April  1985.   The
    respondent decided to deport him for reasons explained  in  her  letter
    dated 23 February 2017.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge McGrade dismissed the appellant's appeal  for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 20 July 2017.

 3. (The judge found against the appellant  on  establishment  of  5  years
    residence, and that finding is not challenged.)

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by the UT.

 5. The grounds of appeal to the UT narrate uncontentious matters, and  the
    judge's acceptance at  �12  "that  the  pattern  of  serious  offending
    behaviour has not continued following [the appellant's] arrival in UK",
    and then continue:

      For measures to be justified on grounds of  public  policy  or  public
      security, the personal conduct of the person involved must  present  a
      genuine, present sufficiently serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
      fundamental  interests  of   the   society   [Citizenship   Directive,
      Art.27(2); EEA Regulations Reg 21 (5) (c)]. The threat must be present
      at the date of the deportation order [BF (Portugal) v SSHD  2009  EWCA
      Civ 923].  The fact that the appellant has committed previous offences
      is not a matter, which can solely justify deportation.

      In those circumstances, it is evident the FtT  failed  to  follow  the
      guidance and legal principles set by Court of Appeal in BF  (Portugal)
      and Gheorghiu [2016] UKUT 24.

 6. Mr Winter submitted further to the grounds as follows:

      i) The case raised a short point, whether the tribunal  was  right  in
         finding that the  appellant  represented  a  genuine,  present  and
         sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
         interests of society.

     ii) The decision  narrated  the  appellant's  previous  convictions  in
         Poland, admittedly quite serious, but the last of which was imposed
         on 5 October 2009, attracting 18 months imprisonment.

    iii) The reasoning for the decision was at paragraph 12.  There  was  no
         sufficient explanation there why the appellant represented a threat
         in the terms required, all the significant offending having been in
         Poland.

     iv) In so far as there was  any  reasoning  at  paragraph  12,  it  was
         inadequate, given the minor nature  of  the  offending  in  the  UK
         (2013,  possession  of  cannabis,  fine  �75);  and  there  was  no
         reasoning for the finding that the appellant had taken no steps  to
         reform or rehabilitate himself. Such steps were shown by the  minor
         nature of the further offending.

      v) This was not a rationality challenge,  but  based  on  the  reasons
         given being inadequate to support the outcome.

     vi) There was no scope for further hearing. The primary facts were  not
         in significant dispute.

    vii) The decision should be reversed.

 7. Mrs O'Brien submitted thus.

      i) The grounds were no more  than  disagreement  with  clear  findings
         reached by the judge.




  ii) The judge's assessment was a factual one; it was within reason; and it
      was adequately explained.



 iii) Permission had been refused by the FtT.  Although  that  decision  had
      been procedurally  superseded,  its  reasoning  was  correct  and  was
      adopted:

           The judge ...  went  on  to  look  at  the  number  of  previous
           convictions for which the appellant received  substantial  terms
           of imprisonment, albeit some were suspended ... It  was  because
           the appellant had been convicted in the UK and in the absence of
           it being shown he had taken any steps to reform or  rehabilitate
           himself, the judge comes the conclusion that the applicant  does
           represent a genuine threat justifying his deportation ...  those
           findings  were  open  ...  on  the  evidence  and  disclose   no
           [arguable] error of law.



  iv) At paragraph 12 the judge did not fall into the error of  saying  that
      previous convictions in Poland solely justify the  outcome.  He  noted
      the further conviction in the UK,  relatively  minor  but  related  to
      drugs, and a sensible indicator against reform or rehabilitation.  The
      finding at paragraph 12 of the absence of any steps in that  direction
      was also to be read in context of the whole decision.  Although  under
      the  further  heading  of  proportionality,  the  judge  was   clearly
      unimpressed by  the  evidence  brought  by  the  appellant  about  his
      relationship and about his  employment  history.  Those  matters  were
      relevant to rehabilitation and ongoing propensity to offend.



   v) The case might have been capable of decision either way, but the judge
      gave his reasons, and no error in point of law  was  shown  in  coming
      down on the side which he did.



  vi) The  appellant's  challenge  was  essentially  that  the  outcome  was
      perverse, but that was not made out.

 8. Mr Winter in response submitted that the judge required to address each
    element of the test - whether the threat was genuine;  whether  it  was
    present; and whether it was sufficiently serious. His reasons  did  not
    sufficiently support findings adverse to the appellant on any of  those
    elements.

 9. I reserved my decision.

10. No reference was made to either of the cases cited in the grounds.   It
    does not appear that they illustrate  any  legal  principle  which  the
    decision fails to observe.

11. The error suggested by the grounds is that the judge thought  that  the
    Polish convictions solely justified the outcome.   That  error  is  not
    present in the decision.

12. Reading paragraph 12 alone, the decision is  plainly  based  not  on  1
    factor but on 3, namely: (1) the number and seriousness of offences  in
    Poland; (2) conviction of a further offence in the UK; and (3)  absence
    of any evidence of steps towards reform or rehabilitation.

13. That alone might dispose of the grounds.

14. At paragraphs 13 - 18 the judge makes unchallenged findings, under  the
    heading of proportionality.  He explains why the  appellant's  evidence
    has fallen short of making out his claims about his employment history,
    his relationship, his partner's alleged need for  his  assistance,  and
    his  estrangement  from  his  family  in  Poland.   I  agree  with  the
    respondent that factor (3) is fortified by reading the  decision  as  a
    whole.

15. The challenge in the submissions was that the judge  gave  no  adequate
    reasons.  It was not that there was nothing in the case  by  which  any
    judge might, within reason, have dismissed the appeal.

16. The challenge of inadequacy of reasoning has not been made out.

17. The decision has not been shown to fall beyond the scope of reason,  in
    so far as there was a latent challenge to that effect.

18. It has not been shown that the  making  of  the  decision  of  the  FtT
    involved the making of any error on a  point  of  law.   That  decision
    shall stand.

19. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
