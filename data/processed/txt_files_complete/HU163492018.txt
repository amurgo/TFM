For the Appellant:     Mr Dixon, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of South Africa born in  1972.  He  appeals
    with permission the 26th March 2019 decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge  Gurung-Thapa)  to  dismiss  his  appeal  against   deportation.
    Whilst the Appellant accepts that he is in law liable  to  deportation,
    he maintains that he should not be deported because to do so would be a
    disproportionate interference with his Article 8 rights.




    Background

 2. The chronology leading to the decision to deport is as follows:

    1972 The Appellant born in South Africa

    1974 The Appellant arrives in the United Kingdom aged 2

    1982 The Appellant taken into care of the local authority, aged 10

    1997 The Appellant is convicted of 3 counts of burglary and receives  a
                  suspended sentence of 2 years' imprisonment

    2001 The Respondent grants Indefinite Leave to Remain

    2008 The Appellant is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, depression
                  and anxiety after having twice attempted suicide (once  by
                  slashing his wrists, once by jumping into the Thames)

    2011 The Appellant is convicted upon a  guilty  plea  of  2  counts  of
                  indecent assault on a child under 14; 6 counts of indecent
                  assault on a child under 16; 3 counts of  gross  indecency
                  with a child under 16; one count of rape of a child  under
                  the age of 16. The victim of all offences was his  younger
                  sister, and all of the offences were  committed  prior  to
                  1998.  He is sentenced to 8 years in prison

                  The Respondent notifies the Appellant of his liability  to
                  deportation

    2015 The parole board unanimously supports the Appellant's  application
                  for release into the community

 3. The decision to deport was taken on the 15th April 2016, just short  of
    five years after the Appellant  was  first  told  that  the  Respondent
    considered him to be  liable  to  be  deported.  There  has  thereafter
    followed a series of events which have significantly delayed the  legal
    process. The Respondent imposed, and  then  rescinded,  a   certificate
    under  s94(1)  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002;   the
    Appellant's removal was affected with a medical escort to Durban but he
    was refused entry to South Africa because he was not in possession of a
    mandatory Emergency Travel Document;  he  was  thereafter  returned  to
    immigration detention; a further planned removal  was  cancelled  after
    the  Appellant  was  referred  to  Neurology  because   he   had   been
    experiencing seizures.  The position, as the appeal reached the  First-
    tier Tribunal, was that it had then been almost eight years  since  the
    Respondent had first indicated deportation action,  three  years  since
    the deportation order had been signed and over three  years  since  the
    parole board had authorised the Appellant's  release.  He  remained  in
    prison - not an immigration detention centre - at the date of the First-
    tier Tribunal hearing.  He was 46 years old and had spent 44  years  of
    his life in the United Kingdom.

 4. The legal framework of the appeal before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    uncontroversial. The Appellant is,  by  reason  of  his  2011  criminal
    conviction, liable to automatic deportation: s32(5) UK Border Act 2007.
    He can succeed in resisting deportation if he can show that any of  the
    exceptions in section 33 of  the  UK  Border  Act  2007  apply.    That
    section contains 6 exceptions, only one of which is potentially engaged
    on the facts:  s33  (2)(a),  that  his  deportation  would  breach  his
    Convention rights, that  is  to  say  his  rights  under  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.

 5. Before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant relied on Article 8 of the
    Convention, submitting that his deportation would be a disproportionate
    interference with  his  private/family  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Because he seeks to rely on Article 8 the Tribunal was  bound  to  have
    regard to the provisions in respect of the public interest set  out  in
    s117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:

         '(1)  The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.'

 6. The effect of these provisions was that it  was  not  enough  that  the
    Appellant show that one of the  'exceptions'  in  s117C  was  met.  The
    length of his sentence required him to show that there  were  over  and
    above  those  matters,  or  equivalence   thereof,   "very   compelling
    circumstances" such that his  deportation  would  be  disproportionate,
    notwithstanding the very substantial  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
    public interest in these circumstances.  In  order  to  discharge  that
    burden the Appellant pointed to his very long residence in  the  United
    Kingdom; his private life here; his complete  lack  of  connections  to
    South Africa;  his own difficult personal  history  including  a  claim
    that he himself had been abused as a child  and  had  been  taken  into
    care; his diagnosis of serious mental illness, and the  long  delay  in
    the decision being implemented.  The Respondent  pointed  to  the  very
    lengthy sentence and the abhorrent nature of the  crimes  committed  to
    submit that the public interest very clearly prevailed.

    The First-tier Tribunal Decision

 7. The First-tier Tribunal began its deliberations by considering  whether
    the Appellant could meet the requirements set out at  s117C(4)  of  the
    2002 Act (and replicated at paragraph 399A of the Rules). It found that
    the Appellant has lived lawfully in the United Kingdom for most of  his
    life [at its �50].  It  further  accepted  that  he  was  socially  and
    culturally integrated here [�52].   As to whether there would  be  very
    significant obstacles to the Appellant's integration into South  Africa
    the Tribunal found as follows:

      a) He has no ties to South Africa and has not been  there  since  1974
         (apart from the few days spent  in  hospital  there  following  the
         failed attempt to deport him) [�54];

      b) His family in the United Kingdom could provide him  with  emotional
         and financial support in South Africa [�60];

      c) If this is wrong he is of an age and maturity  where  he  would  be
         able to start a new life without family support [�69];

      d) There is no satisfactory evidence to  suggest  that  the  Appellant
         will not receive the immediate treatment that he requires (for  his
         paranoid schizophrenia, epilepsy and anxiety) [�66];

      e) The Appellant is an intelligent and  resourceful  man  who  started
         work at the age of 15/16 [�69];

      f) There is no reason why he could not find some sort of work in South
         Africa [�69].

    Having considered all of those matters the Tribunal was  not  satisfied
    that  there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to   the   Appellant's
    integration in South Africa.

 8.  The  Tribunal  then  turned  to  consider  whether  there  were  'very
    compelling circumstances' over and above the matters set out above.  On
    the Appellant's behalf Counsel had identified the relevant matters here
    as the fact that the Appellant had not  committed  any  offences  since
    1997; the parole board and probation service regarded him as presenting
    a low risk of reoffending;  his custodial record had  been  of  a  high
    standard; it was he who had disclosed the offences. He had also  served
    a far longer sentence than he should have done because the Home  Office
    refused to let him out.  Against  those  matters  was  the  substantial
    sentence and the nature of the crimes themselves; although it  was  his
    own confession that had  brought  about  his  prosecution  he  had  not
    entered a guilty plea and his sister had been forced to come  to  trial
    and testify, an extremely difficult and  painful  experience  for  her.
    Weighing those matters together the Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that
    there were here compelling circumstances and the appeal was dismissed.

 9. Permission was granted on the 25th April 2019  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Fisher.

    The Appellant's Grounds

10. The Appellant submits that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    flawed for the following errors of law:

      i) Making findings not supported by the evidence/inadequate reasoning.
         In particular:

         The Tribunal found that the  Appellant  would  be  emotionally  and
         financially supported in South Africa by his family in  the  United
         Kingdom (his mother and brothers). There was  no  evidential  basis
         for this finding which ran contrary to the Tribunal's finding  that
         the family were not prepared to offer him support here.

     ii) Failure to take material facts into account. In particular:

         The Tribunal concluded that the Appellant would  be  able  to  find
         work and support himself in South Africa, so  enabling  himself  to
         buy  the  medication/  treatment  he  requires  for  his   paranoid
         schizophrenia. It is submitted that in reaching  that  finding  the
         Tribunal failed to have regard inter alia to  the  impact  of  that
         illness on the Appellant's ability to orientate himself, and so  to
         secure employment within a reasonable time of  his  arrival  there.
         In fact the country expert evidence was  to  the  effect  that  the
         Appellant was very unlikely to be able to secure employment  and/or
         access to his medication within a reasonable timeframe.

         Further it  is  submitted  that  in  reaching  its  conclusion  the
         Tribunal failed to have regard to the expert  evidence  that  as  a
         foreigner  with  no  social  connections  the  Appellant  would  be
         "extremely vulnerable" in South Africa.

    iii) Failure to apply the 'balance sheet approach'. In particular:

         The Tribunal makes a finding that  the  Appellant  would  not  face
         'very significant obstacles' to his integration  in  South  Africa.
         It then proceeded to consider whether there were  'very  compelling
         circumstances'  such  that  the  decision  to  deport   should   be
         overturned, but in doing so failed to  weigh  in  the  balance,  in
         addressing that question, all of the matters that  it  had  already
         considered in  the  context  of  the  test  under  the  Rules.  The
         Appellant's serious mental illness  was,  for  instance,  a  matter
         relevant to both the test of 'very significant obstacles' and 'very
         compelling circumstance', but it is omitted from  consideration  of
         the latter.

     iv) Failing to recognise that the  delay/mistakes  in  the  Appellant's
         case  had  diminished  the  public  interest  in  his  removal.  In
         particular:

         The Appellant  submits  that  the  delay  in  proceeding  with  his
         deportation, including wrongly  applied  s94  certificates  and  an
         aborted deportation to South Africa,  have  diminished  the  public
         interest in pursuing his deportation now. The  Tribunal  failed  to
         have regard to that matter.

      v) Misdirection in law in respect of section  117C/paragraph  399A  of
         the Rules. In particular:

         The rule contains a three-part test. The Appellant must demonstrate
         that he has lived here lawfully for most of his life and that he is
         integrated here. The Tribunal found  that  he  has  discharged  the
         burden in respect of both matters. The third question  was  whether
         there were 'very significant obstacles'  to  integration  in  South
         Africa. The Tribunal found that he had not shown  that  to  be  the
         case. Mr Dixon contends that in fact the burden in respect of  that
         final limb lay with the Respondent and that the Tribunal materially
         misdirected itself in concluding otherwise.

    Discussion and Findings

11. I deal with ground  (v)  first  because  it  raises  a  discrete  legal
    argument that does not turn on the facts.

12. Mr Dixon based his submission on the notion that because the  rule  can
    be taken to reflect an Article 8 balancing exercise (see  for  instance
    Hesham Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 60)
    the successive limbs therein can be equated with the various stages  in
    a classic Razgar enquiry. In such an enquiry it is for  the  individual
    claimant to establish that there is, for instance, a private life,  and
    that the impugned decision interferes with it in a manner  sufficiently
    serious to engage Article 8.  It would then be for  the  Respondent  to
    demonstrate that the decision is lawful and necessary,  ie  it  is  not
    disproportionate. Thus the burden of proof shifts from the claimant, to
    lie ultimately with the Secretary of State. That burden is  plain  from
    the wording of Article 8(2):

         "There shall be no interference by  a  public  authority  with  the
         exercise of this right except such as in accordance with  the  law,
         and is necessary in a democratic society ..."

13. Mr Dixon submitted that the same shift in burden must also  apply  when
    looking at Article 8 through the prism  of  the  Rules.  Thus  in  this
    instance it would be for the Appellant to demonstrate  that  Article  8
    was engaged by showing that he had lived in this country lawfully,  and
    that he was socially and culturally integrated here: by  meeting  these
    tests he could demonstrate that he had a private life. Mr Dixon submits
    that properly understood the three-part test must then shift the burden
    to the Secretary of State, to prove that any interference was necessary
    in a democratic society, or that it was not disproportionate.   On  his
    analysis, it would be for the Secretary of State to  prove  that  there
    were not very significant obstacles.

14. Mr Dixon's argument was unsupported by any authority, but that was  not
    surprising since, as I understand it, it only occurred to him while  he
    was on his feet. The analogy has its attraction, but for the  following
    reasons I find it to be misconceived.

15. First,  it  fails  to  recognise  that  in  the  statutory  scheme  the
    Respondent's  case  rests  simply  on  the  presumption,  approved   by
    parliament, that a foreigner who commits crime (of sufficient severity)
    must be deported. That is where the public interest lies. That  is  how
    the Secretary of State means  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  in
    showing the removal of that foreign criminal to be a proportionate  and
    necessary response.

16. Second, it fails to have regard to the words of the provision itself:

         '(4) Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.'

    The drafter requires positive proof that obstacles exist; not that they
    do not. This would strongly suggest that  the  burden  of  proving  the
    matter lies with the party who wants it proved.  That  this  is  so  is
    reinforced by the fact that it concerns an 'exception'  to  the  public
    interest requirement that criminals face deportation (because  that  is
    deemed by parliament to be a necessary and proportionate response).

17. Third, because read in this way the rule gives effect to  long-standing
    domestic and Strasbourg jurisprudence on private life claims in removal
    cases: see for instance Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47.

18. I therefore find that ground (v) has no merit. The First-tier  Tribunal
    was correct to find that the burden of proof lay on  the  Appellant  in
    respect of each sub-section (a)-(c) of s117C.

19. I return to deal with the remaining grounds in order.

20. I am  satisfied,  in  respect  of  ground  (i),  that  there  are  some
    contradictory findings in the determination inasmuch  as  the  Tribunal
    makes clear, in a careful analysis over six paragraphs  (�55-60),  that
    it does not accept that the Appellant  has  retained  any  "real  close
    ties" with his family in the United Kingdom.   They did not  visit  him
    in prison. The evidence about what support they might offer  was  vague
    and unsubstantiated. None of them came to the hearing.  That being  so,
    it is difficult to understand the basis for the  'in  the  alternative'
    conclusion at paragraph 60 that they  would  be  willing  and  able  to
    support him, both emotionally and financially, if he  were  to  go  and
    live on the other side of the world. I agree that there does not appear
    to be any evidential foundation for that conclusion.  That  said,  that
    error is entirely immaterial if the Tribunal was rationally entitled to
    conclude, as  it  did  at  �69,  that  the  Appellant  is  intelligent,
    resourceful and able to find work and found a life for himself  on  his
    own, without any family support. That brings me to ground (ii).

21. The crux of this case is whether the  Appellant  is  actually  able  to
    establish some kind of meaningful  private  -  or  family  -  life  for
    himself in South Africa.  If the effect of his removal  would  be,  for
    instance,  that his mental health spirals out of control, and  that  he
    finds himself a stranger in a strange land, living rough on the streets
    or in a shanty town, scavenging for food and presenting  as  easy  prey
    for criminals, it  could  be  said  that  his  would  amount  to  'very
    compelling circumstances' of the sort that might tip  the  balance,  no
    matter  how  deeply  abhorrent  his  crimes.   The  analysis   of   the
    Appellant's personal characteristics, and how  he  might  fare  in  the
    South Africa of today, was therefore determinative.

22. The First-tier Tribunal records that the Appellant was first prescribed
    the anti-psychotic drug Olanzapine in 2009 after  voices  in  his  head
    told him to slash his wrists and jump into the  river  Thames.  He  has
    been on it, or other anti-psychotics, ever since. It would appear  that
    this medication has kept the Appellant stable -  or  at  least  it  has
    contributed to his stability. He told a psychiatrist that  he  has  not
    self-harmed for some 9 years and that he feels he has  benefitted  from
    the medication regime that he is on.   Dr  Nimmagadda,  the  Consultant
    Psychiatrist whose report  was  before  the  Tribunal,  concluded  that
    currently it was likely that the  Appellant  continued,  from  time  to
    time, to 'hear voices', and that he did suffer from some  anxiety,  but
    other than that he is well.   In contrast,  if  the  current  treatment
    were to be withdrawn, the prognosis in  respect  of  psychotic  illness
    would be poor. He would be likely  to  present  with  significant  risk
    behaviours, including self-harm.

23. Thus the evidence about the availability of the  Appellant's  treatment
    regime in South Africa  was  of  some  significance.  If  it  could  be
    maintained,  then  this  would  support   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
    conclusion that the Appellant would be able to surmount obstacles  such
    as obtaining work, housing, friends,  and  all  the  other  constituent
    parts of a normal life.  If it could not, then this  would  throw  that
    conclusion in doubt.

24. Mr Dixon did not dispute that the drugs that the Appellant requires are
    available  in  South  Africa.  Those  representing  the  Appellant  had
    commissioned a report from Adam Ashworth, Professor of AfroAmerican and
    African Studies at the University of  Michigan[1]  who  explained  that
    they can be purchased, for a price: "it is possible for the wealthy  to
    obtain excellent treatment for whatever ails them" [at page  5  of  the
    report].    At the time that he wrote his report a one-month supply  of
    Clozapine cost R1087, but psychiatric consultations cost several  times
    that amount, depending on location.

25. If you are not wealthy there are stocks in the public sector,  but  two
    problems there arise.  The  first  is  that  supplies  are  not  always
    reliable. The second is that the administration of  anti-psychotics  is
    complex. It requires regular  monitoring  and  laboratory  testing  "if
    possibly fatal side-effects are to be minimized".  It is here,  in  the
    monitoring and prescription, that the public health system is found  to
    be "far from  satisfactory".  Professor  Ashforth  here  sets  out  the
    detailed  findings  of  a  study  of  patients  at  one  of  the  "most
    experienced  and  knowledgeable  institutions  dispensing   psychiatric
    medicine in South Africa".  The conclusion of that study is that across
    a range of measures the administration of the drugs was found to be non-
    compliant  with  international   protocols   for   the   treatment   of
    schizophrenia.    This  evidence  accords  with  Professor   Ashworth's
    general conclusion that "public facilities have declined to  below  the
    standards once considered  inadequate  when  reserved  exclusively  for
    Blacks".

26. Professor Ashworth concludes that unless  the  Appellant  "is  able  to
    obtain a well-paying job, with health  insurance,  on  arrival,  it  is
    unlikely he will be able to afford the  costs  of  private  treatment".
    Alternatively,  he  might  eventually  be  considered  eligible  for  a
    government issued Disability Grant. If so eligible he would  receive  a
    monthly grant of R1690. After  buying  his  medication  he  would  have
    enough left over for one  "modest  lunch  at  a  suburban  restaurant".
    Professor Ashworth continues:

         "Without supportive social networks, and/or  substantial  financial
         resources, [the Appellant] is likely to find himself  in  extremely
         difficult  circumstances.  He  would  also   have   difficulty   in
         navigating the extremely complex maze of public health  clinics  in
         order to maintain his treatment regimen. Indeed, a recent study  of
         pathways to mental health treatment in South  Africa  reports  that
         most people who access mental health treatment in public clinics do
         so through arrest by the police".

27. It is against that background that Mr Dixon submits that the First-tier
    Tribunal was not rationally entitled to state, as it does at  its  �66:
    "there is no satisfactory  evidence  before  me  to  suggest  that  the
    appellant will not receive the immediate treatment  that  he  requires"
    (emphasis  added).  Mr  Dixon  accepts  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    certainly registers some regard to Professor Ashworth's  evidence,  but
    asks me to note that this only  comes  after  the  conclusion  that  is
    reached at �66. He further submits that the Tribunal gives  no  reasons
    or indication that  it  regarded  his  expert  evidence  as  less  than
    satisfactory.

28. I accept that the Tribunal did err in fact when it said that there  was
    "no satisfactory evidence" to  suggest  that  treatment  would  not  be
    immediately  available.  That  was  the  whole  import   of   Professor
    Ashworth's unchallenged, and uncriticised,  evidence.  Looking  at  the
    determination as a whole it is possible to say that the Tribunal had in
    mind at its �66 its subsequently expressed conclusion, at �69, that the
    Appellant would be able to find work and support himself.  If that were
    the case then according to Professor Ashworth, he would,  depending  on
    his salary, be able to access  the  mental  health  treatment  that  he
    needs.  It is however difficult to see that the Tribunal has  here  had
    regard to the mechanics: if the  Appellant  needs  a  job  to  get  his
    medication, it is extremely unlikely  that  his  access  to  medication
    would  be  "immediate".  No  consideration  is  given  to  whether  the
    Appellant's history of offending and deportation,  mental  illness  and
    long absence from South Africa might affect his ability to  find  work.
    Nor does the determination deal with this bleak assessment by Professor
    Ashworth:

         "Were he to return to South Africa  without  substantial  financial
         resources, even were he not to be  suffering  from  serious  mental
         illnesses, [the Appellant] would be in serious difficulties.  South
         Africa is the most socio-economically  unequal  country  on  earth.
         People with money live comfortably,  though  they  have  to  invest
         substantial resources in securing themselves against crime.  People
         with limited resources survive by virtue of their social  networks.
         Devoid of supportive networks or cash, [the  Appellant]  will  most
         likely be forced to take up residence in  an  informal  settlement,
         where he would be considered a foreigner,  and  will  be  extremely
         vulnerable.

         With his condition of schizophrenia, he is  in  even  more  serious
         risk of harm. In addition to the  stigma  and  discrimination  that
         residents of countries such as  the  United  Kingdom  recognise  as
         consequent to  mental illness, and which  is  highly  prevalent  in
         South  Africa,   many   people   in   Africa   interpret   auditory
         hallucinations,  such  as  [the  Appellant]  experiences,  as  real
         communications with invisible beings. The hearing  of  'voices'  is
         sometimes understood as  benevolent  communications  from  tutelary
         ancestors, saints or helpful spirits - to mention but a  few.  More
         often, however, these hallucinations are interpreted as evidence of
         demonic forces issuing commands. This can result in  self-harm  and
         suicide but can also put the sufferer at risk of harm from  others.
         This is particularly  evident  in  impoverished  communities  where
         people are generally less educated and their lives subject to great
         stress and insecurity.

         In recent decades, the proliferation  of  Pentecostal  churches  in
         South Africa obsessed with hounding out demons has intensified  the
         pressure  on  persons  hearing  voices  such  as  is  common   with
         schizophrenia. Traditional African modes of understanding relations
         with invisible beings have also encouraged people to make sense  of
         schizophrenic symptoms in religious idioms.  A  person  subject  to
         hallucinations, such as [the Appellant], who is not well known  and
         supported by his family and community is at risk of being  attacked
         as an embodiment of evil spiritual powers intent on causing harm on
         the community".

29. Given  Dr  Nimmigadda's  view  that  the  Appellant  still  experiences
    auditory hallucinations even with his  medication,  this  evidence  was
    obviously pertinent to whether the Appellant would be able to safely re-
    establish himself in South Africa.  The omission to  weigh  it  in  the
    balance was an error of law.

30. For the foregoing reasons I find ground (ii) to be made  out.  As  this
    matter was fundamental to the overall  decision  it  follows  that  the
    decision must be set aside.

31. I need therefore only be brief in dealing with grounds (iii) and (iv)

32. The complaint in ground (iii) is that the Tribunal failed to  weigh  in
    the balance  any  positive  findings  that  it  made  when  considering
    s117C(4) in its final reckoning on s117C(6).  The  Secretary  of  State
    accepted as a matter of principle that when a decision maker  comes  to
    look at whether there  are  "very  compelling  circumstances"  all  the
    evidence must be assessed in the round.   Whilst  I  accept  the  legal
    validity of Mr Dixon's point, the materiality of  it  is  difficult  to
    identify here, where the First-tier Tribunal didn't appear to make  any
    positive findings in the Appellant's  favour  that  could  usefully  be
    "carried over" to inform its ultimate conclusions.

33. In respect of ground (iv) I accept as a matter of legal principle  that
    delay in affecting deportation  can  be  relevant:  MN-T  (Colombia)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  893,  EB
    (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008]  UKHL  38.
    As I have set the decision aside on grounds (i) and (ii) the  Appellant
    has leave to argue this point upon re-making, but I would observe  that
    given the nature of his offending,  and  the  very  substantial  public
    interest in his deportation, it is unlikely to add  materially  to  the
    Appellant's case. At present it appears that the appeal  is  likely  to
    turn on the Appellant's  likely  circumstances  upon  return  to  South
    Africa. Either they will drop below the standard considered  acceptable
    in humanitarian terms, or they will not.

34. I therefore set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

    The Re-Made Decision

35. As I have  set  out  above,  the  Appellant  is  subject  to  automatic
    deportation. Because he is  a  serious  offender  he  can  only  resist
    deportation  if  he  can  show  that   there   are   "very   compelling
    circumstances" over and above  the  other  matters  set  out  in  s117C
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. I mark at the outset that
    this test sets an extremely high threshold. Where an offender has  been
    sentenced to four years imprisonment or more the public  interest  will
    "almost always" outweigh  any  countervailing  factors:  Hesham  Ali  v
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department [2016]  UKSC  60.   "Very"
    imports a very high threshold. "Compelling" means  circumstances  which
    have a "powerful, irresistible and convincing effect":  SSHD  v  Garzon
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1225.

36. In applying this extremely demanding test I begin by marking the nature
    of the Appellant's offence and the sentence imposed by the trial judge.
    Whilst it may be true that the Appellant  has  not  committed  a  crime
    since 1997 this must be of minimal significance given that it is in  my
    view likely that his victim continues to live with the consequences  of
    those crimes on a daily basis.  I have not been provided with a witness
    impact  statement,  nor  psychological  evidence  in  respect  of   the
    Appellant's sister, but I do not think I need it. It is  overwhelmingly
    likely that this woman's life has been  defined,  and  marred,  by  her
    childhood experiences[2].  There is little point  in  dwelling  on  the
    adjectives that might be employed to describe this offence. 'Abhorrent'
    and 'shocking' both feature in the reasoning of judges  who  have  gone
    before me, and whilst I would adopt those terms the nature of the crime
    can be powerfully reflected in stating  it  as  it  is:  the  Appellant
    sexually assaulted his own sister, repeatedly, when she was a child.

37. That being the case I am quite satisfied that the weight of the  public
    interest in the Appellant's deportation is so substantial that only the
    most extreme consequences could justify allowing this appeal. I do  not
    say that as a matter of law the test of "very compelling circumstances"
    is to be equated with a violation of the United  Kingdom's  obligations
    under Article 3 ECHR, but in a case such as this the threshold must  be
    approaching that highest of benchmarks. I say  this  mindful  that  the
    grounds of appeal  are  based  not  on  Article  3  but  Article  8:  I
    appreciate that my task  is  to  conduct  a  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, but in light of the  offences,  I  mention  Article  3  as  a
    benchmark, to reflect the strength of the public interest and  to  give
    an indication of what I am looking for in my cumulative  assessment  of
    the matters relied upon by the Appellant.  I deal with  each  of  those
    factors in turn.

    Long Residence and Integration

38. There is now no dispute that the Appellant has  lived  continuously  in
    this country since he was two years old[3]. He arrived in 1974  and  he
    has been here ever since. He was granted ILR in 2001. It  was  on  this
    basis that the First-tier Tribunal found that  the  Appellant  met  the
    first two requirements  of  the  private  life  exception  at  s117C(4)
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002: he has lived lawfully  in
    the United Kingdom for  most  of  his  life  and  he  is  socially  and
    culturally integrated here.  Before me the Secretary of State  accepted
    those findings.

39. The relevance of long residence in this case  is  the  uncontrovertible
    reality that the United Kingdom is the only home the Appellant has ever
    known. He is today 47 years old and he has no meaningful experience  of
    living in any society other than our own.  His deportation would result
    in a nullification of the private life that he currently enjoys in this
    country.  This is clearly a matter that must attract some  weight:  the
    question is, how much?

40. In Maslov v Austria (1638/03) [2008] ECHR 546 the ECtHR  revisited  the
    issues discussed in Uner v The Netherlands (46410/99) [2006]  ECHR  873
    that arise when a "long-term immigrant"  commits  crime.   In  both  of
    those cases the court affirmed  that  the  considerations  set  out  in
    Boultif v Switzerland  (54273/00)  [2001]  ECHR  497  are  of  especial
    relevance in cases where the deportee has spent a large  proportion  of
    his life, and childhood, in the host country, leading to  this  overall
    conclusion:

         "the Court considers that for a settled migrant  who  has  lawfully
         spent all or the major part of his or her childhood  and  youth  in
         the host country very  serious  reasons  are  required  to  justify
         expulsion. This is all the  more  so  where  the  person  concerned
         committed the  offences  underlying  the  expulsion  measure  as  a
         juvenile".

41. Mr Dixon understandably placed some emphasis on this jurisprudence.  He
    submitted that since the Appellant was, at the date of the decision  to
    deport, a settled migrant who  had  spent  the  vast  majority  of  his
    minority in the United Kingdom, I must  be  satisfied  that  there  are
    "very serious reasons" to deport him.

42. Whilst I accept that the very long residence of 42 years is a factor of
    some weight in this case, I do not accept that this is a case  on  all-
    fours with Maslov.  The facts in Maslov that led the ECtHR to  set  the
    bar so high for the Austrian authorities were that Maslov  himself  was
    still a child at the date that he committed his offences; he was barely
    18 at the date of the proposed deportation and was not deemed to be  of
    sufficient age or maturity to be expected  to  start  a  new  life  for
    himself back in Bulgaria,  a  country  he  barely  knew.   These  facts
    distinguish Maslov from a case such  as  this,  where  the  criminality
    continued well into adulthood (at the date  of  the  last  offence  the
    Appellant was 25 years old) and the Appellant is today a mature man  of
    47 years  old.   That  the  Maslov  principles  are  limited  by  their
    reference to the facts in that case has been made clear by the Court of
    Appeal: see for instance Mwesezi v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1104 [at �11-12].

43. Although I do not  accept  that  this  is  a  pure  Maslov  case  I  am
    nevertheless prepared to attach  some  weight  to  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant has lived in the United Kingdom for what is in effect all  of
    his conscious life.  It is accepted that he is socially and  culturally
    integrated in this country and that life here is all he has ever known.



44. I would add one point, although it is  one  that  I  have  attached  no
    additional weight to. That is that it seems to me to be wholly probable
    that for a period during his childhood the Appellant would prima  facie
    have been entitled to British nationality. He arrived, as a  'non-visa'
    national, in 1974. Although the Respondent can find no record  of  that
    entry, nor indeed any contact at all with  the  Appellant  until  1999,
    the Appellant himself recalls that  in  the  1970s  his  South  African
    passport  contained  a  vignette  confirming   that   there   were   no
    restrictions on his leave: in light of the  matters  uncovered  by  the
    Windrush enquiry[4] that is wholly plausible.

45. More significantly I know that from 1982 the Appellant  was  under  the
    care of the Housing and Social Services Department of the Royal Borough
    of Kensington and Chelsea[5]. The Department confirmed this in a letter
    addressed to a Home Office caseworker on the  30th  January  2001.  The
    letter states:

         "[The Appellant] was known to the children and families social work
         team in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea from 1982  when
         he was taken into care and remained in  the  local  authority  care
         until adulthood the case was closed in 1996"

    Given its duty of care it seems to me to be wholly  unlikely  that  the
    social services department of Kensington and Chelsea would  have  taken
    legal responsibility for the Appellant over a  14-year  period  without
    ensuring that his immigration status in this country was secure.  There
    being no Home Office records of any correspondence with the  department
    would tend to indicate that the Appellant's passport was endorsed as he
    claims, reassuring the social workers charged with his care that he had
    permission to reside in the United Kingdom.

46. That being the case, I find that the Appellant would have been able  to
    make an application for British nationality as early as 1983.   Section
    6(1) of the  British  Nationality  Act  1981,  read  with  Schedule  1,
    requires applicants to show five years lawful residence, with at  least
    12 months of indefinite leave immediately preceding the application. In
    1983 the Appellant would have met those requirements.  There  being  at
    that time no obvious issues of character, and  assuming  that  such  an
    application  would  have  been  made  on  the  Appellant's  behalf   by
    Kensington and Chelsea social services, I can  see  no  reason  why  it
    would not have been successful.

47. I am therefore prepared to  accept  that  from  sometime  in  1983  the
    Appellant qualified for citizenship, and that  he  was  failed  by  the
    social services department who neglected to make  that  application  on
    his behalf.    I am however unable to find that this was an entitlement
    that pertained right up to the date  that  the  deportation  order  was
    signed, and his  indefinite  leave  to  remain  extinguished:  that  is
    because we now know that in 1986 the Appellant started to commit crimes
    of a nature likely to cause the Secretary  of  State  to  exercise  her
    discretion under s6 BNA 1981 unfavourably.   As I note above this is  a
    matter to which I have attached no additional weight to. The fact  that
    the Appellant could or should at one time have naturalised as a British
    national is simply one facet  of  his  long,  long  residence  in  this
    country and his deep social integration here.

    Childhood Trauma

48. In CI (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 2017 the Court of Appeal considered the deportation appeal  of
    a man who had committed a series of crimes at a young age,  spanning  -
    as here - his teens and twenties. He had twice been sent to prison  for
    in excess of 12 months and although not a serious  offender  like  this
    Appellant, was required to demonstrate that there were "very compelling
    circumstances" in his case, since it had been found that  none  of  the
    'exceptions' at s33 of the Borders Act 2007 could be  applied  to  him.
    The Upper Tribunal had dismissed his appeal. The  Court  held  that  in
    doing so the Tribunal had erred in failing to set CI's  criminality  in
    the context of his  personal  history  [at  �119]:  that  CI  had  been
    horribly neglected and abused as a child and had ended up in care  [see
    �8] was a relevant consideration in the balancing exercise.

49. With this guidance in  mind  I  recognise  that  the  Appellant  had  a
    difficult childhood.  His father had already left  the  family  by  the
    time that the Appellant and his mother arrived in the United Kingdom in
    1974 and he has had no contact with him since. After their arrival  the
    Appellant's mother formed a relationship with a man named  Richard  who
    was extremely abusive towards the Appellant.  The Appellant reported to
    Dr Nimmigadda  that  Richard  would  beat  him  and  that  on  multiple
    occasions tried to drown him by holding his head  under  water  in  the
    bath. His mother also hit him.  It was this abuse that resulted in  the
    Appellant being placed in care.  This personal history is  recorded  in
    the Appellant's medical notes and statement. It is  also  reflected  in
    the sentencing remarks of  Denniss  HHJ  who  said  that  the  evidence
    painted "a picture of somebody who has been seriously physically abused
    as a child", a history leading  Judge Denniss to conclude: "I think  it
    is very easy to understand, as you say yourself, how the abused  became
    the abuser".

50. I mark that personal history, and the fact  that  the  offending  began
    when the Appellant himself was just a child of  14/15.   Whilst  it  is
    important not to lose sight of  the  Appellant's  clear  culpability  -
    particularly since the offending, the most serious offending, continued
    into his mid-20s - I have given some weight to  the  context  in  which
    these terrible crimes were perpetrated.

    Rehabilitation

51. In his sentencing remarks, made on the 26th May 2011, HHJ Denniss  told
    the Appellant "in my judgment you are  at  a  low  risk  of  committing
    further sexual offences and you do not represent in any way a danger to
    the public".   I have been  provided  with  extensive  notes  from  the
    probation service covering their 9 years of working with the  Appellant
    but I need not set this evidence out in any detail since their ultimate
    conclusions are uncontested by the Secretary of State, being  consonant
    with the findings of Judge Denniss, Dr Nimmigadda, Dr Naidoo and indeed
    the parole board,  who unanimously chose to release the Appellant  from
    custody in 2015: the Appellant present a low risk of reoffending.

52. I attach some weight to that matter, and to the uncontested  fact  that
    it has been approximately 23 years  since  the  Appellant  committed  a
    crime. I bear in mind that the crimes only ever came to  light  by  his
    own spontaneous confession and Judge Denniss' assessment that they were
    to some extent a product of the Appellant's own history  of  abuse  and
    assault as a young child. That weight is necessarily limited,  however,
    since the statutory scheme provides for automatic deportation for  past
    crime, and is not predicated on any  forward-looking  risk  assessment:
    see  Velasquez   Taylor   v   Secretary   of   State   for   the   Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 845,  PF (Nigeria) v The Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 251.  It is one factor  that  I
    have taken into account, but it has not assumed much significance in my
    overall assessment:

53. I now turn to consider the elements of the Appellant's case which in my
    view attract the greatest weight: the obstacles that he  will  face  in
    returning to South Africa.  I remind myself that the Appellant need not
    simply  show  that  there  are  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  his
    integration there - itself a high test -   but  that  there  are  "very
    compelling circumstances" over and above that matter.

    Health

54. Although there are many other  letters,  records  and  reports  in  the
    bundles  before  me  I  have  here  drawn  upon  two  main  sources  of
    information about the Appellant's  current  condition.  These  are  the
    assessments made by two Consultant  Psychiatrists,  the  expertise  and
    conclusions of whom the Respondent accepted.   The first is that of  Dr
    Nimmigadda, whose report was before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  It  is
    undated but is based on assessments  made  in  June  2018.  The  second
    opinion, that of Dr Kuben Naidoo, was sought for the purpose of the re-
    making of the decision in the Upper Tribunal. That report is based  not
    on a single consultation, but on Dr Naidoo's own clinical knowledge  of
    the Appellant: he has been his Responsible Clinician since March 2019.

55. From these reports I draw the following chronology in  respect  of  the
    Appellant's mental health:

    Approx. 2002  The Appellant  starts  to  experience  constant  auditory
                  hallucinations  in  the  form  of  voices  talking  -   or
                  screaming - at him day and night. Began  to  feel  extreme
                  anxiety and persecutory ideation as a result.

    2002-2009     After an increase  in  paranoid  thoughts  the  Appellant
                  makes several serious attempts on  his  life.  On  various
                  occasions he  took  overdoses,  tried  to  slash  his  own
                  throat, pushed  a  screwdriver  into  his  rib  cage,  and
                  slashed his wrists in front of his mother. In perhaps  the
                  most serious attempt he took an overdose  and  then  threw
                  himself in the Thames; he was in the water for 15  minutes
                  before being pulled out and resuscitated by a RNLI.

                  After the  latter  attempt  the  Appellant  comes  to  the
                  attention  of  mental  health  services.  Diagnosed   with
                  'treatment resistant' paranoid schizophrenia  and  treated
                  with depot injections in the community.

                  injections prescribed.

                  Prison  medical  records  show  consistent  reporting   of
                  anxiety and depression as well as symptoms associated with
                  psychosis, including auditory hallucinations, apathy, poor
                  motivation,  'thought  broadcasting',   paranoia,   hyper-
                  salivation, tremors/shakes, myoclonic jerks, and a lack of
                  social interaction.

    2014 Last recorded incident of physical self-harm

    March 2019    The Appellant released from prison following parole board
                  hearing. Deemed to be stable at the point of  release  but
                  prescribed anti-psychotic medication Clozapine.

                  Following his release from HMP Whatton  the  Appellant  is
                  managed by Bootle Community Mental Health  Team.  Includes
                  regular (monthly) blood  monitoring  for  the  purpose  of
                  managing his anti-psychotic medication.

    c. April 2019 Last recorded incident of  suicidal  intent  -  Appellant
                  felt urge to throw himself off a bridge but  was  able  to
                  resist.

    Present  The Appellant continues to hear familiar, but  unfriendly  and
                  critical voices. He reports being  able  to  resist  their
                  negative commands.

    Ongoing anxiety and panic attacks.

56. Dr Naidoo explains that the Appellant's condition is  currently  stable
    because of the Clozapine prescription. Although he  continues  to  hear
    voices and feel anxious the  medication  suppresses  the  more  extreme
    psychotic symptoms such as suicidal ideation. He requires regular blood
    monitoring whilst on this medication because it has a  side  effect  of
    reducing the white blood cell count in the body,  leaving  the  patient
    open to life threatening infection.  The purpose of the  monitoring  is
    therefore to manage  the  prescription  accordingly.   It  is  in  this
    context that Dr Naidoo expresses serious concerns about the Appellant's
    welfare should he be deported to  South  Africa.  Whilst  Clozapine  is
    available, in the absence of regular monitoring the prescription  could
    not be safely managed.  This disruption to his medication regime should
    be assessed in the context of deportation being  "major  negative  life
    event that could contribute to a relapse in his illness.  Coupled  with
    social isolation and  his  risk  history,  this  may  place  him  in  a
    particularly vulnerable situation".

57. Dr  Nimmigadda  expresses  similar  conclusions.  He  points  out  that
    Clozapine is the anti-psychotic of  last  resort,  prescribed  only  in
    paranoid  schizophrenia  deemed  to  be  'treatment  resistant'.    The
    Appellant has responded to it "reasonably well" but continues  to  hear
    voices.  He believes that the Appellant's prognosis if removed to South
    Africa is likely to be poor.   The prescription of Clozapine is complex
    (he makes the same point as Dr Naidoo about  the  importance  of  blood
    monitoring) and expresses the view that if the Appellant is  unable  to
    access treatment his mental health is likely to deteriorate;  he  might
    present with significant risk behaviours, including self-harming.  On a
    positive note Dr Nimmigadda states that the Appellant has complied well
    with his treatment regime,  remains  largely  stable  and  has  had  no
    personal difficulties with those treating him. He remains in  telephone
    contact with his family in London and derives some support from that.

58. Other than these reports the most recent material of note is a letter I
    was given on the day of the resumed hearing. It is from Dr C Willis,  a
    Staff Grade Psychiatrist who is part of  the  community  mental  health
    team currently managing the Appellant in Bootle, and it  is  dated  7th
    February  2020.  Dr  Willis  confirms  the  current   prescription   of
    Clozapine, Omeprazole, Levitiracetam and Epilim, all of  which  are  to
    treat either epilepsy or paranoid schizophrenia.  Dr Willis writes that
    notwithstanding this treatment the Appellant remains extremely  anxious
    and continues to experience auditory hallucinations.   He avoids  going
    out if at all possible as a  result  of  his  anxiety.    A  letter  to
    similar effect was sent by the Appellant's GP Dr White in January -  Dr
    White states that the Appellant  reports  avoiding  either  crowded  or
    confined spaces, either of which can trigger panic attacks.

    Work History

59. Although he left  school  with  no  qualifications  the  Appellant  did
    manage, at least until he became too unwell, to hold down several  good
    jobs. He worked from the age of 15 at a warehouse which rented props to
    the film industry. He then worked as a systems engineer for  a  courier
    company for approximately two years and latterly as  a  guard  for  the
    Ministry of Defence at Millbank and Regents  Park  Barracks.   At  some
    point he also worked as a bus driver.  The prison service confirm  that
    he worked throughout his time in prison.

    Conditions in South Africa

60. The Appellant has supplied two reports by Professor Ashworth.

61. The first is dated 23rd May 2018 and summarised  at  my  �24-28  above.
    In this report Professor Ashworth was asked  to  address  the  specific
    issues surrounding the Appellant's access to mental  health  treatment.
    The global conclusion reached by Professor Ashworth  is  that  although
    Clozapine is technically available in South Africa,  regular  and  safe
    access to it is complicated. The Appellant would need to find  a  well-
    paying  job,  preferably  one  with  health  insurance,  to  obtain  it
    privately since the cost of one month's supply would  be  prohibitively
    high to those on a low wage or the minimal  income  provided  by  state
    disability benefits.   The costs of psychiatric consultations are  even
    higher.   In the public sector the  government  of  South  Africa  has,
    since the fall of the apartheid regime in 1994,  aspired  to  create  a
    world-class and human rights compliant program  for  the  treatment  of
    mental illness, but has  roundly  failed  to  meet  those  aspirations.
    Provision in  the  public  sector  is  now  worse  than  it  was  under
    apartheid: "public facilities have declined to below the standards once
    considered inadequate when reserved exclusively for Blacks".

62. There is in addition the added difficulty of the cultural  response  to
    mental illness. Professor Ashworth points out that in South Africa many
    people interpret auditory hallucinations as  real  communications  with
    invisible beings. Such hallucinations are most  often  "interpreted  as
    evidence of demonic forces issuing commands. This can result  in  self-
    harm and suicide but can also put the sufferer at  risk  of  harm  from
    others. This is particularly evident in impoverished communities  where
    people are generally less educated and their  lives  subject  to  great
    stress  and  insecurity".   The  recent  proliferation  of  Pentecostal
    churches in South Africa has exacerbated this problem, since  they  are
    "obsessed" with hounding out demons.  Professor Ashworth concludes that
    a "person subject to hallucinations, such as [the  Appellant],  who  is
    not well known and supported by his family and community is at risk  of
    being attacked as an embodiment of  evil  spiritual  powers  intent  on
    causing harm on the community".

63. At the initial 'error of law'  hearing  I  noted  Professor  Ashworth's
    evidence that  the  Appellant  would  face  "serious  difficulties"  in
    establishing himself in South Africa, absent his mental health  issues.
    He wrote that South  Africa  is  the  most  socio-economically  unequal
    country on earth, and  it  is  still  struggling  with  the  legacy  of
    apartheid. The aspirations of the black majority remain unfulfilled and
    poverty, unemployment, violence and crime remain endemic.  People  rely
    on social networks, in particular family structures  to  survive.    In
    light of that evidence I  asked  if  Professor  Ashworth  was  able  to
    comment on any particular issues that might  arise  for  the  Appellant
    because of his racial identity. He is what is  referred  to,  in  South
    African parlance, as 'coloured': what we would call mixed-race or  dual
    heritage.  Under  apartheid  this  was  one  of  four   ranked   racial
    categories, the others  being  'white',  'Indian'  and  'black'.  These
    communities were kept apart and  in  check  by  operation  of  law.  At
    various  times  the  white-minority  regime  used  the   'Indian'   and
    'coloured' communities as a political tool to suppress or  outmanoeuvre
    the black majority, bestowing upon them privileges and benefits  in  an
    attempt to co-opt them into propping up  the  status  quo.   Given  the
    potential legacy of that period in South African  history  I  requested
    that Professor Ashworth make specific  comment  about  the  Appellant's
    race.

64. The result was his addendum report dated 25th October 2019.   Professor
    Ashworth writes that since  President  Mandela  left  office,  and  the
    immediate optimism of the 'rainbow nation' receded,  it  is  "generally
    acknowledged that racial tensions and  intercommunal  violence...  have
    increased considerably". The 'coloured' community express  a  grievance
    that under apartheid they were not white  enough,  yet  under  the  new
    government they are not black enough.   Professor  Ashworth  cites  one
    sociological study into 'coloured' identity as concluding: "there is  a
    strong feeling  that  the  Coloured  people  have  traded  one  set  of
    oppressors under apartheid for a larger, even more unscrupulous set  of
    oppressors since 1994".  The racial segregation once  enforced  by  law
    has now become the de facto norm:

         "Racial tensions and intercommunal violence between  black  African
         and coloured communities have  increased  significantly  in  recent
         years, resulting in an informal system of  segregation  reinforcing
         the racial separations in residential areas once enforced  by  law,
         particularly in low-income informal settlements.  These  areas  are
         notoriously hostile to outsiders".

65. In light of this continued segregation,  Professor  Ashworth  concludes
    that the Appellant would have "little option" but to seek accommodation
    in a 'coloured' neighbourhood,  and  thereby  expose  himself  to  very
    difficult living conditions. These communities have the highest  murder
    rates in the country:

         "In the years since the democratic  transition  in  1994,  Coloured
         neighbourhoods have become subject to control by organised criminal
         gangs. As a recent study reported these  gangs  have  evolved  from
         groups of youngsters hanging around street corners defending  their
         territory  from  outsiders  into  "criminal  empires...[that]  have
         managed to integrate themselves into the  social  organizations  of
         their communities and  have  established  themselves  as  'critical
         institutions  of  provision'.  The  problem  of  gang  violence  in
         Coloured townships has become so extreme that in July of this  year
         the South  African  government  deployed  the  army  into  affected
         neighbourhoods in an attempt, so  far  unsuccessful,  to  keep  the
         peace. These neighbourhoods are extremely dangerous".

66. Professor Ashworth dismisses the notion that the police might  be  able
    to offer the Appellant protection from criminality on the grounds  that
    the police are notoriously corrupt  and  ineffectual.  Most  crimes  go
    unreported and few people bother turning to the police. Those  who  can
    afford it employ private security guards.  Those  who  cannot  rely  on
    "informal social networks or vigilante groups and  local  gangs  for  a
    modicum of security in the face of rampant crime".  Professor  Ashworth
    makes clear that these options  are  unlikely  to  be  available  to  a
    stranger such as the Appellant:

         "Lacking a dense social network  capable  of  providing  protection
         [the Appellant] would be extremely exposed  to  the  predations  of
         criminal gangs and in grave danger of being subjected  to  violence
         in the neighbourhoods where he would inevitably be forced  to  seek
         accommodation. His medical conditions would make  integration  into
         those neighbourhoods even more difficult."

67. Mr Tan took no particular issue with Professor Ashworth's  analysis  of
    South African culture and society. He did however  strongly  object  to
    the way in which Professor Ashworth had interpreted the evidence on the
    availability  of  drugs  and  treatment  for  the  mentally  ill.   The
    Respondent relied on two primary sources, each in turn relied  upon  by
    Professor  Ashworth.  The  first  is  a  report  by  the  World  Health
    Organisation 'Report on the  Mental  Health  System  in  South  Africa'
    published in September 2007. Mr Tan pointed out that according to  this
    report,  80%  of  the  population  has  access  to  free   psychotropic
    medicines, and that these are available at  a  minimal  cost,  "generic
    antipsychotics" being available at the cost of 24 cents per  day.   The
    second document was a report, co-sponsored by a number of NGOs and  co-
    funded by  the  European  Union,  entitled  'Stop  Stockouts'.  It  was
    published in 2017 and is concerned with the availability  or  otherwise
    of medicine in South Africa.  Mr Tan pointed to a table therein showing
    that various anti-psychotics are available in South Africa in over  90%
    of the facilities that usually stock medicine.

68. Having considered all of the evidence, I am  satisfied  that  Professor
    Ashworth's research is valid and that I can place weight upon  it.  The
    WHO report relied upon by the Respondent dates back to 2007 and  refers
    only to "generic anti-psychotics". As such it is unclear  whether  that
    is  inconsistent with the very specific  evidence  given  by  Professor
    Ashworth about Clozapine, and its current cost of R1087 per  month   (I
    am not told whether that would  be  considered,  in  2007,   to  be   a
    "generic" medication, or whether there has  been  a  marked  change  in
    price due to inflation or other factors).    As  for  the  more  recent
    'Stop Stockouts' report is it correct to  say  that  this  lists  three
    particular  types   of   anti-psychotic   medication   (Zuclopenthixol,
    Haloperidol  and  Risperidone)  and  indicates  that  they  are  widely
    available. I am unable however to find any reference in that report  to
    Clozapine (or Clozaril, another name by which  it  is  known).  As  the
    evidence of Dr Naidoo and Dr Nimmigadda makes clear, the  Appellant  is
    on Clozapine, with the attendant risks to his immune system, because no
    other drugs have worked.   Nor do Stop Stockouts make  any  comment  on
    the administration or monitoring of the medication, a key part  of  the
    prescription of Clozapine according to the evidence of Drs  Naidoo  and
    Nimmigadda.

    Discussion and Findings

69. As I hope I have made clear (see my �36-37 above)  the  nature  of  the
    offending and the length of sentence in this case mean that the  weight
    to be attached to  the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of  the
    Appellant is very great indeed.   The cumulative weight of  what  might
    be termed the 'UK factors' - the Appellant's extremely  long  residence
    and strong integration, his history of childhood trauma, rehabilitation
    and low risk of reoffending  - are indeed compelling,  but would in  my
    view fall short of displacing the public interest in  a  case  such  as
    this.   Parliament, society and indeed the Appellant's victim  are  all
    entitled to consider that crimes  such  as  this  must  attract  severe
    consequences, consequences that could include the deportation of a  man
    who is entirely British in his social and cultural identity  [see  �118
    CI (Nigeria) supra].  Those are not however the only  relevant  factors
    in this case.  Far  more  significant,  in  my  view,  are  the  likely
    consequences for the Appellant upon return to South Africa.

70. The Appellant has no ties whatsoever with South Africa,  a  country  he
    left before he would have been aware of any cultural or  social  norms.
    Mr Tan urged me to find that he may be able to derive some support from
    his paternal  family  there  but  such  a  finding  would  be  entirely
    speculative - there is no evidence that the Appellant has ever had  any
    contact with his paternal family, or that  they  would  be  willing  to
    offer him assistance.  Having left that country as an infant  there  is
    nothing to suggest that he was in London brought up in  a  particularly
    South African milieu.    Although his mother  no  doubt  imparted  some
    values and behaviours, there is no evidence that the family  were  part
    of a wider diasporic community, or that the Appellant, in any event  in
    care during his formative years, would have developed any understanding
    of South African society.  Even if he had done, the South Africa of the
    1970s is obviously an extremely different place to the South Africa  of
    today.  The complex legacy of apartheid means that  incomers  to  South
    Africa face a  unique  set  of  challenges  in  'fitting  in'.  Reading
    Professor Ashworth's evidence I find  that  the  Appellant  would  have
    little to no chance of integrating there in the sense of establishing a
    meaningful private life for himself. In Secretary of State for the Home
    Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 Lord Justice Sales put the test
    like this [at �14]:

         "The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment to
         be made as to whether the individual will be enough of  an  insider
         in terms of understanding how life in the  society  in  that  other
         country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to
         have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to
         operate on a day-to-day basis in  that  society  and  to  build  up
         within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships  to  give
         substance to the individual's private or family life".

71. As a 'coloured' man with no social or operative  familial  connections,
    and no idea of how society operates, I have no hesitation in concluding
    that the Appellant would not be "enough of an insider" to  successfully
    navigate the challenging  landscape  of  South  Africa  almost  half  a
    century after he left that country. It  is  of  course  true  that  the
    Appellant was at one time capable of working to support himself. He has
    during  his  life  in  the  United  Kingdom   built   friendships   and
    relationships. Those capabilities would however be sorely  tested  upon
    removal by the confluence of his poor socio-economic prospects in South
    Africa, his race and his lack of connections there. I am not  satisfied
    that there is any real prospect of the Appellant managing to  establish
    any meaningful private life in South Africa in the foreseeable  future.
    Accordingly I am satisfied that the final limb of the test set  out  at
    s117C(4) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (and
    replicated at paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules) is met.

72. I must now assess whether there are "very compelling circumstances over
    and above" that matter.

73. The unchallenged medical evidence is that the Appellant  has,  over  at
    least the past 18 years, battled with one of the most severe  forms  of
    mental illness. His medical notes refer  to  depression,  anxiety,  bi-
    polar disorder and psychosis but the two consultant  psychiatrists  who
    have provided evidence to this Tribunal concur that the final diagnosis
    is of treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia.

74. In the period before he was diagnosed, and  before  he  had  access  to
    treatment, the disease compelled the Appellant to attempt to  take  his
    own life on multiple occasions.  At various times voices  in  his  head
    commanded him to slash his own  wrists,  slash  his  own  throat,  take
    overdoses, push a screwdriver into his ribcage and jump into the  River
    Thames.

75. Even after treatment commenced,  the  Appellant  has  over  many  years
    continued to experience symptoms of his disease.  The  medical  records
    kept by HM Prison Service during his  incarceration  refer  to  a  wide
    range of issues.   The  Appellant  was  reported  to  exhibit  external
    symptoms including an  inability  or  unwillingness  to  interact  with
    others,  tremors  and  'myoclonic  jerks'  (jerking/twitching  of   the
    muscles) and hyper-salivation.  Internally he continued  to  experience
    auditory hallucinations in the form of hostile voices, anxiety,  panic,
    paranoia and 'thought broadcasting' (the notion that others can hear or
    know your thoughts).   As the Appellant's GP, current community  mental
    health team and Dr Naidoo all report, he continues to  experience  such
    symptoms today, even after many years on the drug of  last  resort  for
    his condition, Clozapine.

76. The Appellant's mental illness is, for the purposes of  this  decision,
    his defining personal characteristic.  Against the  background  of  the
    medical and expert evidence I now assess the  likely  events  following
    deportation.   I do so by imagining - in light of  the  known  facts  -
    what the best case scenario might be.

77. The best-case scenario for the Appellant is that upon  his  arrival  in
    South Africa he has with him enough medicine to last him until his next
    blood test - I make it clear that this is something of an assumption on
    my part  since  it  was  given  no  evidence  nor  undertaking  by  the
    Respondent that this would in fact be the case. Let me assume  that  he
    received a blood test and  new  prescription  on  the  day  before  his
    flight, so he has about one months' supply. Let me also assume that  he
    is in possession of some money, perhaps supplied by the Home Office  or
    IOM - again this is wholly speculative  and  I  was  provided  with  no
    assurances that this would be the  case  (setting  aside  the  COVID-19
    suspension of the programme there is the additional difficulty that his
    return would not be voluntary[6]). Perhaps he will have been given some
    extra money by his family, but again there was no evidence to say  that
    this would be the case. Let me  assume  that  the  Appellant's  mother,
    herself out of  South  Africa  for  approaching  50  years,  still  had
    sufficient  local  knowledge  to  direct  him  to  a  suitable  -  i.e.
    'coloured' - neighbourhood.

78. The Appellant arrives in that neighbourhood with  enough  drugs  for  a
    month and enough money for a month's rent. Let me assume that  he  will
    also have sufficient funds to feed himself for that month.   So far  so
    good. He is in his room, he  has  food,  and  his  mental  health  has,
    notwithstanding the massive stress  of  deportation,  somehow  remained
    constant.

79. At this point I find it very difficult to see how, even  in  the  best-
    case scenario, the Appellant is going to  manage  once  his  funds  and
    medications run out.

80. He knows no-one and is very obviously an outsider. He is in  effect  an
    Englishman who has turned up wanting to live in what Professor Ashworth
    describes as an area so "extremely dangerous" that the state  felt  the
    need in 2019 to  deploy  the  army.   According  to  that  unchallenged
    evidence, such neighbourhoods  are  subject  to  control  by  organised
    criminal gangs and are closed communities, hostile to outsiders.   That
    is the  reality  outside  his  door.   I  accept  Professor  Ashworth's
    evidence that in those circumstances  he  is  likely  to  attract  some
    attention, and be easy prey for criminals.

81. The Appellant already suffers, in the stability of the  United  Kingdom
    and with full access to treatment, a range of symptoms associated  with
    his disease. In particular he continues to  hear  hostile  voices,  and
    experience  intense  feelings   of   paranoia,   anxiety   and   panic.
    Professor Ashworth has, over the course  of  his  career,  focused  his
    study on the perception of mental illness and/or  difference  in  South
    African society. He has written extensively on the perceived  existence
    of witches and demonic possession. This is  how  many  South  Africans,
    particularly those from  impoverished  communities,  understand  mental
    illness. Professor Ashworth writes that  unless  you  have  protection,
    those around you are likely to react to your  illness  with  hostility:
    "a person subject to hallucinations, such as [the  Appellant],  who  is
    not well known and supported by his family and community is at risk  of
    being attacked as an embodiment of  evil  spiritual  powers  intent  on
    causing harm on the community".  This is how the Appellant is likely to
    be received by the people around him.

82. Again assuming that the Appellant's current  symptoms  of  his  disease
    remain constant, it would in my view be perverse to conclude that those
    conditions would not significantly impede the  Appellant's  ability  to
    try and find work, to negotiate what Professor  Ashworth  describes  as
    the "extremely complex maze" of pathways into the public health system,
    or simply to interact with others on a day to day level.  In  the  best
    case scenario the Appellant has a month to locate a clinic where he can
    access blood monitoring for a further prescription of Clozapine. Having
    had regard to Professor Ashworth's evidence it is clear that this  will
    be a huge challenge for the Appellant.  It  is  not  one  that  on  the
    evidence, he appears likely to be able  to  surmount.  At  present  his
    anxiety levels are such that he is effectively housebound.  He  suffers
    from panic attacks going out in Bootle, where he  lives,  but  in  this
    scenario the streets of the United Kingdom are replaced  by  a  strange
    neighbourhood in a strange country, controlled  by  violent  gangs  and
    where the population at large perceive you to be controlled by demons.

83. It is against that background that the debate about  whether  Clozapine
    is readily available in South Africa begins to recede in  significance.
    Assuming once again a 'best case' scenario I am prepared to accept that
    the Appellant, in his anxiety-riddled and  psychotic  state,  might  be
    able to locate and access a clinic  where  the  drug  is  available  at
    little or no cost. In light of Professor Ashworth's evidence there must
    however remain serious concerns about  whether  the  appropriate  blood
    testing and monitoring  would  be  conducted,  leaving  the  drug  with
    reduced efficacy and compromising the Appellant's immune system.   Even
    assuming that he manages to surmount that obstacle and  find  a  clinic
    complying with international prescription norms, he is still a complete
    stranger  who  knows  no-one,  with  serious  mental   health   issues,
    attempting to integrate in one of the most  violent  societies  in  the
    world.

84. That was the very best case  scenario  that  I  can  envisage  for  the
    Appellant.   I  find  that  the  cumulative  challenges  faced  by  the
    Appellant in that scenario are such that the very high test set out  at
    s117C(6)  is  met.   The  public  interest  requires  the   Appellant's
    deportation,  but  not  at  the  expense  of   the   United   Kingdom's
    international obligations  under  the  ECHR.  Even  assuming  that  his
    condition does not worsen and that he has access to some initial  funds
    and medication, I am unable to find that the conditions  faced  by  the
    Appellant would be anything less than inhuman and degrading.

85. It follows that I need not explore at length the worst  case  scenario,
    where the stress of deportation causes the Appellant's mental health to
    deteriorate. This was the outcome considered likely by Drs  Naidoo  and
    Nimmigadda, and I make it clear that I have no reason  to  doubt  their
    evidence.  My findings above notwithstanding, the more  likely  outcome
    for the Appellant is that his deportation would cause his mental health
    to spiral downward. His ability  to  negotiate  even  the  most  urgent
    matters  -  such  as  finding  accommodation  -   would   be   severely
    compromised. Anyone he speaks to will quickly understand that he is not
    'normal'. He will be viewed with curiosity at  best  and  hostility  at
    worst. Without anyone to vouch for him I find it very difficult to  see
    how he will get a job, and with worsening mental health I find it  very
    difficult to see how he would manage to negotiate the public health  or
    benefits system. He will be easy prey for criminals or  for  those  who
    perceive his mental illness to somehow be a threat  to  them.   On  the
    evidence I have I find the most likely consequence of deportation would
    be that the Appellant will, very quickly after  his  arrival  in  South
    Africa, run out of money, run out of drugs and find himself  living  on
    the streets. The public interest does not require that.

    Anonymity

86. The Appellant is a  criminal  and  his  identity  would  not  therefore
    ordinarily  attract   protection.   I   am   however   concerned   that
    identification of the Appellant could lead  to  identification  of  his
    victim. Further I am satisfied,  having had regard to the  guidance  in
    the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders,  that
    because of the medical evidence in this case it would be appropriate to
    make an order in accordance with Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

87. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law
    and it is set aside.

88. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:

         "The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds".

89. There is an order for anonymity.

    Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce Date: 17th April 2020
-----------------------
[1] Professor Ashworth has been an academic specialising in the study of
Southern Africa since 1981; it does not appear that any issue was taken
with his expertise.  His current focus is on public health in the region.
[2] I make these comments cognizant of the sentencing remarks of HHJ
Denniss to the contrary: having heard the victim in the witness box Judge
Denniss did not consider that she displayed any signs of "overt serious
physical harm or overt lasting psychological damage". He also considered
that the victim's reasons for distancing herself from her natal family "are
probably due to other factors entirely".

[3] In taking the decision to deport the Secretary of State accepted only
that the Appellant had been here since 1977. Before me the Secretary of
State was content to proceed on the basis of the uncontested finding of the
First-tier Tribunal that he in fact arrived in 1974.
[4] See the review by Wendy Williams:

[5] I note that Mr Dixon's instructions are to the contrary: his brief is
that the Appellant in fact went into care in approximately 1986. This
appears to be based on the Appellant's own recollection that he was taken
into care after leaving home at the age of 14 (see for instance �22 of the
First-tier Tribunal decision).   Whilst I note this discrepancy I am minded
to adopt the findings of the author of the letter from Kensington and
Chelsea, given that she has drawn upon formal council records to give that
information.
