Solicitors

Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. Before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State becomes the appellant.
     However, for the avoidance of confusion, I shall continue to refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. On 20th October 2014 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Davidge  gave
    permission to the respondent to appeal against the decision of Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Somal who allowed the appeal on the basis  that
    the respondent's refusal decision was not in accordance  with  the  law
    without considering the substance of the asylum and  Article  8  claims
    for the appellant, a citizen of Vietnam.

 3. In summary, the grounds of  application  noted  that  Judge  Somal  had
    allowed the appeal because the respondent's reasons  for  refusing  the
    appellant's asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims did
    not give proper consideration to the directions of Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Pooler who had previously remitted the matter back to the
    Secretary of State on 3rd June 2014.  Judge Pooler had found  that  the
    refusal decision of 27th March 2014 was unlawful  because  it  did  not
    adequately consider the alleged failure by the  respondent  to  try  to
    trace the appellant's family.  It was also stated that  the  respondent
    had  failed  to  consider  granting  discretionary  leave   under   the
    respondent's policy relating to unaccompanied  asylum-seeking  children
    (UASC) of January 2011, the appellant having previously been  found  to
    be 17 years of age.  Judge Pooler  had  directed  that  the  respondent
    should consider whether, in the  light  of  his  determination  and  an
    earlier one of 8 February  2011,  concerning  the  appellant's  age,  a
    period of leave to remain should be granted and if so, for how long.

 4. The respondent argued that  the  supplementary  refusal  letter  issued
    following the decision of Judge Pooler  had  responded  to  the  issues
    raised, placing  reliance  on  Court  of  Appeal  jurisprudence  before
    reaching the conclusion that it was not appropriate to grant  any  form
    of leave to the appellant  despite  the  historic  failure  to  act  in
    accordance with either the UASC policy or the respondent's  section  55
    tracing duties.  The judge had wrongfully concluded  that  the  refusal
    letter had given "no meaningful consideration" to the issues or ignored
    the directions of Judge Pooler.  If Judge Somal had disagreed with  the
    respondent's conclusions  then  she  should  have  proceeded  with  the
    hearing of the appeal and made findings on any alleged  unfairness  and
    the substantive grounds of the appeal.

 5. Judge Davidge granted permission on the  basis  that  the  respondent's
    grounds of application were arguable.  In particular she observed  that
    the decision only extended to two pages,  the  majority  of  which  was
    given to historical recitation,  and  did  not  give  reasons  for  the
    conclusion that the respondent's decision could be regarded as  not  in
    accordance with the law.

Error on a point of law

 6. At the hearing before me I heard submissions from both representatives.

 7. Ms Johnstone confirmed that the  respondent  relied  upon  the  grounds
    emphasising  that  Judge  Somal  was  wrong  to   conclude   that   the
    respondent's supplementary refusal letter (which was stated to be  read
    in conjunction with the original refusal of 27th March  2014)  did  not
    gloss over the issues.  Whilst she conceded that delay was not an issue
    covered by either letter that was a matter for the  judge  to  consider
    and did not create a legal error.  She reminded  me  that  paragraph  8
    onwards of the supplementary refusal dealt specifically with the  issue
    of discretionary leave with cogent reasons given for refusing.

 8. In support of her arguments Ms Johnstone made reference  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Ukus (Discretion: when reviewable) Nigeria  [2012]
    UKUT 307 (IAC) which  concludes  that,  where  the  decision-maker  has
    lawfully exercised his discretion, the Tribunal must either uphold  the
    decision or, if it is believed  that  the  decision-maker's  discretion
    should have been exercised differently, reach a different  decision  in
    the exercise of its own discretion.  She contended that the  discretion
    had been properly exercised in  this  case  with  reasons  and  so  the
    judge's task was to proceed to hear the appeal substantively.

 9. Mr Vokes argued that the decision of Judge  Somal  was  not  irrational
    even if the respondent did not like it.  The appellant had  been  found
    to be under the age of 17ï¿½ years in 2011 by the Tribunal (Judge of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Holmes)  and  thus  the  decision  to  treat  the
    appellant as an adult was not  legitimate.   Three  years  later  Judge
    Pooler had pointed  out  that  there  were  tracing  duties  which  the
    respondent had not considered and that the  appellant  had  suffered  a
    disadvantage as a result.  He had therefore,  properly,  directed  that
    the respondent should consider whether discretionary  leave  should  be
    granted.  However, the supplementary refusal letter of 25th  June  2014
    had not considered Judge  Pooler's  comments  or  human  rights  issues
    connected  with  the  appeal.   He  contended  that  the  supplementary
    decision was not in accordance  with  the  law  because  there  was  no
    meaningful consideration of the relevant  issue  and  Judge  Somal  was
    entitled to  point  this  out  and  to  declare  the  decision  not  in
    accordance with the law once again.

10. Mr Vokes indicated that if I were to find that the decision  showed  an
    error on a point of law a remittal to the First-tier Tribunal might  be
    appropriate he would not want a date to be set for the hearing in order
    that he could give some thought to the matter.

11. After I had considered the matter for a few moments I indicated that  I
    was satisfied that the decision of Judge Somal showed  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that it should  be  re-made.   My  reasons  for  that
    conclusion follow.

12. Only one paragraph of the short decision  gives  any  reasons  for  the
    conclusion that the supplementary refusal was not  in  accordance  with
    the law.  The  Judge  states  that  there  is  no  explanation  by  the
    respondent for the delay in dealing with the asylum claim over  several
    years but that, in  itself,  is  not  a  matter  which  gives  rise  to
    illegality in the decision.  The issue is whether or not the respondent
    has in substance dealt with the refusal to  grant  discretionary  leave
    taking into consideration the appellant's age at the  time  he  applied
    for asylum, and  the  relevant  UASC  policy  and  section  55  tracing
    obligations against the background of relevant case  law,  particularly
    that set out in KA (Afghanistan) and Others [2012] EWCA Civ  1014.  The
    latter deals the  consequences  of  a  failure  by  the  respondent  to
    discharge the duty to endeavour to trace relatives where  the  claimant
    has suffered some disadvantage in consequence of that failure.

13. Where the respondent fails to exercise a discretion, as alleged in this
    case, the consequence is set out  in  Ukus.   The  lawful  exercise  of
    discretion can result in a decision which may favour the  appellant  or
    it may not.  Where it does not and an appeal has resulted the  Tribunal
    can,  if  it  thinks  the  discretion  should   have   been   exercised
    differently, reach a different decision.

14. It is quite clear from the original and supplementary refusal decisions
    (which are to be read together) that the respondent properly  exercised
    the relevant discretions both in relation to it's the UASC  policy  and
    tracing obligations by reaching a reasoned conclusion  which,  in  both
    cases, was unfavourable  to  the  appellant.   Both  the  supplementary
    refusal and the original refusal of 27th March 2014 give cogent reasons
    for the unfavourable decisions reached.

15. In paragraph 2 of the supplementary refusal  the  respondent  concisely
    and correctly sets out the issues and in subsequent paragraphs proceeds
    to deal with them by reference to relevant case law  including  KA  and
    also by reference to the earlier refusal (from  paragraph  40  onwards)
    covering both discretionary leave and tracing obligations.  However, in
    her decision, Judge Somal makes no reference to any  of  this  detailed
    reasoning stating simply that the supplementary refusal "glossed  over"
    the important issues.  She also states that the "refusal simply records
    that  the  [appellant]  is  now  an  adult  and  should  not  get   any
    discretionary leave".  These comments are  an  oversimplification  when
    the refusals deal in much greater detail with, for example,  the  issue
    of the applicant's age in conjunction with the guidance of the Court of
    Appeal KA (Afghanistan).  It is evident  that  the  decision  of  Judge
    Somal reaches conclusions which, without  cogent  reasoning,  were  not
    open to her.  On this basis the decision shows errors on points of  law
    such that it should be re-made.

16. My conclusions are such that the appeal should be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal for hearing afresh on all substantive  issues.   I  reach
    that  conclusion  having  regard  to  the  Practice  Statement  of  the
    President of Tribunals dated 25 September 2012 at paragraph 7.2.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows an error on  a  point  of  law
such that it should be re-made.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested before the Upper Tribunal nor did I consider  it
appropriate.



DIRECTIONS

 1. The appeal will be reheard by the First-tier Tribunal sitting at  Stoke
    on a date to be set by the Regional Judge although I recommend that the
    hearing should be set as soon as possible in view of  the  delay  which
    has already occurred in the hearing of the substantive appeal  in  this
    case.

 2. The time estimate for the hearing is three hours.

 3. A Vietnamese interpreter will be required.

 4. The appeal should not be heard before Judges Holmes, Pooler or Somal.
