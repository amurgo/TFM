Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Martin (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Miss A White (instructed by Dicksons, solicitors)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,
   against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge TRP Hollingworth and
   Dr JO de Barros) promulgated on 14th March 2013 in which it  allowed  the
   claimant's appeal under the EEA regulations.

2. It was accepted before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  claimant  had
   been in the UK in excess of 10 years prior to her conviction and thus was
   afforded the highest level of protection under the  EEA  regulations  and
   could only be deported on imperative grounds of public Security.

3. The claimant committed a very serious offence and was sentenced  on  26th
   November 2009 to 6 ï¿½ years imprisonment for being knowingly concerned  in
   the importation of a Class A drug. The circumstances of the offence  were
   that the claimant was intercepted at Gatwick airport with a  large  cache
   of Class A drugs in her luggage. She did not co-operate with police  with
   regard to others involved. That was her first  offence  but  its  gravity
   nevertheless led the judge to impose an immediate custodial sentence.

4. In the grounds the Secretary of State asserts that  at  paragraph  48  of
   the determination the Tribunal noted that the claimant had been  assessed
   in a NOMS 1 form as presenting a medium risk of serious harm  and  a  low
   risk of reoffending, but that an OASys report assessed her as being a low
   risk of both. On that basis the Secretary of State submits  the  Tribunal
   failed to come to a conclusion as to the  risk.   They  had  not  reached
   their own conclusion which they should have done given the inconsistency

5. Secondly the  grounds  assert  that  the  Tribunal  failed  to  make  any
   findings as to whether the claimant had addressed her drug habit,  having
   noted that not only was she misusing drugs at the time  of  the  offence,
   but had been for a number of years. The Secretary of State  submits  that
   was an important issue that would have an  impact  on  the  risk  of  the
   claimant offending in future.

6. Thirdly the Secretary of State submits that the Tribunal failed  to  make
   any findings regarding the claimant's claim in her witness statement that
   her GP said she would never work again. In light of this, the  fact  that
   no one attended court to offer her support, including her  own  daughter,
   the Secretary  of  State  submits  that  the  Tribunal   failed  to  make
   essential  findings about the her support network given that if released,
   she will return to the same area she resided before with little  prospect
   of work.

7. The Secretary of State also referred to the Tribunal's finding  that  the
   claimant was quite willing to lie when it suits.

8. These errors, it is submitted,  render  the  Tribunal's  conclusion  that
   there were not imperative grounds requiring her deportation flawed.

9. Miss Martin expanded on these grounds before me.

10. Miss White, on the claimant's behalf had lodged  a  Rule  24  reply.  In
   particular with regard to the alleged inconsistency between the NOMS  and
   OASys, she said that on examination there was in fact  no  inconsistency.
   The seven-page NOMS report summarises the previous OASys report  of  27th
   May 2011 and at page 7, section 6 assesses the level of risk  of  serious
   harm to others as low; the same assessment reached  in  the  more  recent
   OASys report.  There  is  therefore  no  inconsistency  between  the  two
   documents. That, as revealed by  an  examination  of  both  documents  is
   clearly correct. Furthermore, as Miss White also pointed  out,  the  more
   recent OASys report is a document running to 50 pages,  dated  26th  July
   2012 and prepared by the National Probation Service who must be  regarded
   as experts in their field and better qualified to assess  the  risk  than
   the Tribunal. I agree. The Tribunal can and should rely on such evidence,
   unless it contains demonstrable errors of fact.   That  ground  does  not
   identify an error of law.

11. So far as the claimant's drug habit is concerned it is incorrect to  say
   the Tribunal made no findings. It is quite clear that the Tribunal made a
   finding that she is drug-free. Miss Martin suggested this was not  to  be
   relied upon given that she is in prison. However, Miss Martin is as aware
   as the Tribunal that it is a relatively easy matter to  obtain  drugs  in
   prison. If that were not recognised there would be little point in  their
   carrying out drugs tests, which they do. The evidence is that she is drug-
   free. Not only is she drug free but has  undertaken  various  courses  in
   prison in relation to drugs. That ground does not identify  an  error  of
   law.

12. Finally the Secretary  of  State  asserts  that  the  Tribunal  although
   referring to Tsakourides (Case C-145/09) CJEU  (Grand  Chamber)  did  not
   apply it.

13. The protection afforded to an EEA national who has been in  the  UK  for
   10 years before they can be deported is a high one indeed. In LG  (Italy)
   v SSHD EWCA Civ 190 the Court of Appeal confirmed that  an  EEA  national
   who had been here for 10 years can only be deported on imperative grounds
   of public security, which bear  a  qualitative  difference  to  the  less
   stringent  grounds  applicable  to  deportation  of  those  with  shorter
   residence. Imperative connoted a  very  high  threshold  and  the  ground
   requires an actual and compelling risk to public security, though  public
   security need not be equated to national security.  The Court  of  Appeal
   said that "risk to the safety of the public or a section of  the  public"
   seemed reasonably consistent with the ordinary meaning of the test.   The
   Court of Appeal seemed to be of the opinion  that  the  severity  of  the
   offence committed was not necessarily one to make  removal  "imperative".
   In VP (Italy) v SSHD 2010 EWCA Civ 806 the Court of  Appeal  endorsed  LG
   (Italy) and said that imperative grounds of public security required  not
   simply a serious matter of public policy but an  actual  risk  to  public
   security so  compelling  that  it  justified  an  exceptional  course  of
   removing someone who had become integrated by many years residence in the
   host state.  The severity of the offence could be a  starting  point  for
   consideration but there had to be something more to justify a  conclusion
   that removal was imperative to the interests of public security.   So the
   appellant, an Italian who had been here since 1986 and had served 9 years
   for attempting to murder his ex wife, including twice trying to  cut  her
   throat and inflicting 32 knife wounds, could not be  removed  when  there
   was a low risk of reoffending albeit a medium risk  of  serious  harm  to
   others.

14. In Tsakourides the claimant had an extensive criminal record,  including
   eight counts of illegal dealing in substantial quantities of narcotics as
   part of an organised group and had been  sentenced  to  six  and  a  half
   years' imprisonment.  The Grand Chamber held that a crime  in  connection
   with dealing in narcotics as part of an organised group  was  capable  of
   being covered by the concept of 'imperative grounds of  public  security'
   within the meaning of  Article  28(3).  Drug  trafficking  represented  a
   serious evil for the individual and society and could reach  a  level  of
   intensity that might directly  threaten  the  physical  security  of  the
   population. However, an expulsion measure under Article 28(3) had  to  be
   based on an individual examination of the specific case.  Such a decision
   could only be justified if, having regard to the exceptional  seriousness
   of the threat, such a measure was necessary for  the  protection  of  the
   interests it aimed to secure, provided that that objective could  not  be
   attained by less strict means, having regard to the length  of  residence
   of the Union citizen in the host Member State and in  particular  to  the
   serious negative consequences such a measure may have for Union  citizens
   who had become genuinely integrated into the host Member State (para 49).
   Furthermore, a balance had to be struck between the exceptional nature of
   the threat to public security as a result of the personal conduct of  the
   person concerned by reference to the penalties/sentences imposed and  the
   degree of involvement in the  criminal  offending  against  the  risk  of
   compromising the social rehabilitation of the Union citizen in the  State
   which he had become genuinely integrated. In PI v Oberburgermeisterin der
   Stadt Remscheid (Case C-348/090 CJEU (Grand Chamber)  it  was  said  that
   European jurisprudence had established that the fight  against  crime  in
   connection with dealing in narcotics as part of an  organised  group  was
   capable of being covered by the concept of "imperative grounds of  public
   security" under Article 28(3). That  concept  presupposed  not  only  the
   existence of a threat to public security, but also that such a threat was
   of a particularly high degree of seriousness, as reflected by the use  of
   the words "imperative grounds" (para 15).

15. There was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that  the  claimant
   was part of an organised group. Clearly she was not acting alone; she was
   a mule. She was clearly acting  under  the  instruction  of  probably  an
   organised group. However there is no evidence to indicate  that  she  was
   part of the organisation. The Tribunal was clearly mindful  of  the  high
   threshold for imperative grounds. The Tribunal referred to the case of FV
   (Italy) [2012] EWCA  Civ  1199  which  subsumed  into  its  decision  the
   authority of Tsakourides. The Tribunal correctly directed itself to  case
   law. It,  clearly  with  great  reluctance,  found  that  the  claimant's
   offence, though serious, was  not  one  as  to  justify  her  removal  on
   imperative grounds  of  public  security.  The  Tribunal  considered  the
   likelihood of reoffending and was entitled to conclude on  the  basis  of
   the evidence before it that the risk of reoffending was low. If the  risk
   of reoffending is low it cannot be said to that the  claimant  represents
   such a threat to  the  United  Kingdom  that  she  must  be  deported  on
   imperative grounds of public security.

16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal, representing as  it  does,
   a careful consideration of all of the evidence and  applying  appropriate
   case law contains no error of law and accordingly stands.

17. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed
