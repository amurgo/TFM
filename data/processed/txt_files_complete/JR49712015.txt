                       APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                             EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -


JUDGE LINDSLEY:

 1. This is a judicial review by Mr Diamond Keino Gordon. He challenges the
    decision of 21st April 2015 to refuse his human  rights  claim  and  to
    certify it under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002.  He applied for judicial review on 28th April 2015, in  time,
    and permission for judicial review was granted on the papers  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge McWilliam on 5th June 2015.

 2. In granting permission Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam  noted  that  the
    respondent had certified the claim on the basis there would  not  be  a
    real risk of serious irreversible harm if the  applicant  were  removed
    pending the outcome of his appeal.  The reason for that  was  that  the
    applicant's children were placed in the care of the London  Borough  of
    Merton on 30th April 2014 and  the  applicant's  wife  was  serving  an
    indeterminate  custodial  sentence.   However,  Upper  Tribunal   Judge
    McWilliam noted that in fact the children were  not  in  care  and  the
    respective mothers were not in prison. (Indeed the  mothers  were  also
    not the  current  or  past  wives  of  the  applicant.)   This  created
    reasonable  doubt  in  her  mind  that  the   assessment   of   serious
    irreversible harm had been conducted in the light of the evidence which
    was before the Secretary of State about the mothers and  the  children,
    and this in turn made the reasons for  certifying  the  claim  arguably
    irrational. Permission was granted on all grounds.

 3. The surrounding circumstances of this case are that the applicant is  a
    citizen of Jamaica, born on 18th April 1991.  He came to the UK on 22nd
    August 2002, aged 11 years, as a visitor with leave for six months.  He
    has  never  been  granted  any  further  leave  despite  a  number   of
    applications made on his behalf, and he has therefore  been  unlawfully
    present in the UK since the expiry of his leave as a visitor  in  early
    2003.  The applicant says his entire close family live lawfully in  the
    UK and this would seem to include his three brothers, one  of  whom  is
    married, his mother, his father and his three British citizen children.
     He has three British citizen children  born  in  the  UK.  Two   (aged
    approximately 4 years and 1 year 6 months) with his ex-partner,  Ms  A;
    and a child now aged approximately 3 years with an ex-partner, Ms E.

 4. The applicant was sentenced to eighteen  months'  imprisonment  on  9th
    February 2015 for possession of cannabis with intent to supply  and  is
    therefore a foreign criminal by virtue  of  Section  32(5)  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  A deportation order was signed against him  on  21st
    April 2015, based on this conviction and eight previous matters, and on
    the same day he was  served  with  the  challenged  decision.   He  was
    informed that he could only appeal the  refusal  of  his  human  rights
    claim once he had left the UK, in  accordance  with  the  certification
    under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.



 5. The applicant challenges the decision firstly on the basis that it  was
    unlawful due to failure to consider his family and private life, and in
    particular the rights of his children.  Secondly it is argued that  the
    certification under Section 94B is unlawful due to the  impact  removal
    of the applicant during the appeals process would have on his children.
    He says he  has  a  close  relationship  with  his  children  which  is
    supported by the evidence of their mothers, and that that evidence  was
    not properly considered by the respondent.

 6. The respondent accepts that there were material errors in the  original
    decision of 21st April 2015. As a result that  decision  was  withdrawn
    and a new one was made on 28th July 2015, which has  been  supplemented
    with a further decision of 9th October  2015.  It  is  noted  that  the
    applicant has not applied to amend his grounds  to  challenge  the  new
    decisions. In this light the respondent says, and I find rightly,  that
    the application for judicial review is  academic  and  cannot  succeed.
    The original decision is no longer  relied  upon  in  any  way  by  the
    Secretary of State.  It is clearly stated in the decision of 28th  July
    2015 that that decision replaces the decision under challenge.

 7. Ms Ling has drawn my attention to the decision of R (on the application
    of) SM v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  (striking  out
    principles) IJR [2015] UKUT 00227 (IAC) which considers  the  issue  of
    when a judicial review comes to an end in  the  context  of  subsequent
    decisions by the Secretary of State.   The  relevant  section  of  this
    decision is paragraphs 29 to 39. It is clear from paragraphs 34 and  35
    that it is not uncommon that in immigration and asylum cases  decisions
    are superseded by new ones put forward by the Secretary of State. It is
    also clear that there is a need  to  seek  amendment  to  the  judicial
    review application if it is to be sustained following issuing of a  new
    decision, and that  the  amended  grounds  will  need  to  reflect  any
    additional facts.

 8. SM conducts a review of the historic cases on the  issue  of  when  one
    judicial review comes to an end, and of  particular  relevance  is  the
    case of Rathakrishnan [2011] EWHC 1406 (Admin) in which it was said:

         "It would be a wholly exceptional case in which  a  claimant  could
         postpone the effective quashing of the decision which he sought  to
         have quashed in order that he might at some  later  stage  bring  a
         different challenge in respect of a  different  decision  based  on
         different evidence without  having  to  go  through  the  necessary
         applications, including  payment  of  fees,  for  the  purposes  of
         challenging that further decision and should  therefore  evade  the
         filter mechanism and simply take his place on a seemingly adjourned
         renewal application."

 9. In this case there has been, I repeat,  no  application  to  amend  the
    grounds for judicial review brought.  It has been contended  on  behalf
    of the applicant at the hearing today  that  the  applicant's  skeleton
    argument should be treated as an application to amend the  grounds  for
    judicial review to challenge the new decisions  put  forward.   However
    that contention has not been particularised in any  way  and  does  not
    seem to be in any way reflected by the document itself which  does  not
    refer to the subsequent decisions made by the  Secretary  of  State  of
    28th July 2015 and 9th October 2015. I do not find  that  the  skeleton
    argument was an application to amend the grounds for judicial review.

10. In conclusion I find that the original decision is  clearly  no  longer
    relied upon by the respondent and has been withdrawn and therefore  the
    normal course should follow which is that if there is  a  challenge  to
    the new decisions in relation to this  applicant,  refusing  his  human
    rights application and certifying it under s. 94B of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, that this should be brought by way  of
    new judicial review proceedings. This application for  judicial  review
    is therefore refused. I draw the attention to the applicant, and  those
    representing him, to the careful and considered submissions of Ms  Ling
    about the defensibility of the new decisions in the light of the extent
    of the evidence before the respondent, although  ultimately  of  course
    any decision as to whether to take proceedings  in  relation  to  those
    decisions will be one for the applicant and his lawyers.

11. I refuse permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal as I find there to
    be no arguable error of law for the reasons set out above.

12. My conclusions on costs  are  that  it  was  reasonable  to  bring  the
    application in the  first  instance  as  the  decision  challenged  was
    infected with material errors.  Therefore the respondent should pay the
    applicant's reasonable costs to the 22nd June  2015.  The  reason  that
    this is the relevant date is because on that date the letter  from  the
    Government Legal Department to the applicant's solicitors, which is  at
    tab 21 of the bundle, was written. In this letter it was said  that  it
    was acknowledged that there were material errors  in  the  respondent's
    decision  letter  in  giving  reasons  which  did  not  apply  to   the
    applicant's case  and  as  a  result  the  respondent  was  willing  to
    reconsider the applicant's human rights claim and make a new  decision.
    Up to that point I accept the applicant had good grounds to  bring  the
    action and therefore the respondent should pay the applicant's costs up
    to that time.

13. From that point onwards I  find  that  this  action  should  have  been
    withdrawn as the impugned decision was  withdrawn,  and  therefore  the
    applicant should pay the respondent's reasonable costs.

14. After my decision on costs Ms Ling made an application for wasted costs
    against the applicant's solicitors as from 22nd June 2015.  She  argued
    that  it  had  been  unreasonable  and  negligent  of  the  applicant's
    solicitors to proceed with the judicial  review  hearing.  I  gave  the
    parties a period of 21 days to provide representations on  this  matter
    and also to provide schedules of costs for summary  assessment.  Whilst
    the respondent had provided a schedule at the hearing this was assuming
    they were entitled to all costs from the start  of  proceedings  rather
    than simply from the 22nd June 2015.

15. No further representations were  received  from  the  Government  Legal
    Department. In representations from the applicant's solicitors,  Morgan
    Pearse, dated 29th January 2016, it is argued that the applicant should
    not have to pay costs as he is in prison without any source of  income.
    It is also said that they should not have to pay wasted costs  for  the
    following reasons:

         . as they had acted on a pro bono basis from May 2015 .

         .  as the applicant  had  not  been  willing  to  consent  to  the
           withdrawal of the judicial review action unless  the  respondent
           granted him an in-country right of appeal as he feared that this
           would lead to his removal from the UK.

         .  as the consent  orders  offered  by  the  respondent  were  not
           reasonable  as  they  did  not  offer  to  pay  the  applicant's
           (initial) costs.

         . as the grant of permission was broad in that UTJ  McWilliam  had
           said it was arguable that there  was  a  real  risk  of  serious
           irreversible harm in the light  of the evidence of  the  mothers
           of the applicant's children, and Counsel had advised  them  that
           permission was granted on all grounds.

16. I am guided by Cancino (costs -First-tier Tribunal - new powers) [2015]
    UKFTT 00059 and its careful  analysis  of  the  cases  of  Ridehalgh  v
    Horsefield [1994] Ch 205  and  Myers  v  Elman  [1940]  AC  282  in  my
    consideration of whether it is appropriate to exercise my discretion to
    make an order against Morgan Pearse Solicitors for wasted costs. Wasted
    costs are those costs incurred by improper, unreasonable  or  negligent
    acts.

17. I find that Morgan Pearse have acted unreasonably as their  conduct  of
    this matter does not permit of  a  reasonable  explanation.  Persisting
    with an action for judicial review against a withdrawn decision with no
    amendment  of  grounds  could  not  possibly  be  successful   in   any
    circumstances. It is no defence that they were acting pro-bono or  that
    prior to  withdrawal  of  the  decision  permission  had  been  broadly
    granted.

18. If Morgan Pearse understood that continuing  with  the  action  had  no
    prospects of success but the applicant himself refused to instruct them
    to  conclude  proceedings,  as  he  believed  the  conclusion  of   the
    proceedings would be followed by his removal,  then  they  should  have
    ceased to act for him given their duty as  officers  of  the  court  to
    promote the cause of justice. To continue hopeless proceedings only  to
    avert the applicant's removal for a period of time would be an abuse of
    process. It has ultimately only resulted in his  spending  a  pointless
    period of additional time in detention which simply cannot  be  squared
    with Morgan Pearse's submission that they have conducted representation
    of the applicant's case conscientiously.

19.  If Morgan Pearse wished simply to pursue their costs up to  the  point
    at which the respondent withdrew the  decision  challenged,  then  they
    could have informed the Tribunal that they accepted that  the  judicial
    review should be withdrawn but were unable  to  agree  costs  with  the
    respondent so wished to have a hearing on that issue alone.

20. It is clear by persisting with the judicial review after the 22nd  June
    2015 unnecessary costs were incurred by the respondent.

21.  In all the circumstances I find it appropriate to make a wasted  costs
    order in favour of the respondent for their reasonable costs after  the
    22nd June 2015.

22. I have read and carefully examined the schedules of costs  provided  by
    the parties. I summarily assess  that  the  respondent  shall  pay  the
    applicant �2260 as their costs for work done until 22nd  June  2015.  I
    summarily assess that Morgan Pearse Solicitors shall personally pay the
    respondent �5457.67 as wasted costs from this point to  the  conclusion
    of the proceedings on 13th January 2016.
