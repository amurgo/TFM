                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Ceridwen Griffith),  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  16
    April, to  a parent with contact appeal by  a  citizen  of  Bangladesh,
    born 4 April 1985.

 2. Very briefly, the facts were as follows: the appellant  was  here  with
    leave to remain as the husband of a British  citizen  till  31  October
    2011. They had one daughter, N, born 15 September 2007. On  28  October
    2011 the appellant applied for further leave to remain,  this  time  on
    the basis that, though he and his wife were now divorced, he still  had
    contact with N. Later he produced an order for  him  to  have  indirect
    contact with N, by phone calls and cards, made on 22 August 2012.

 3. On 11 July 2013 the application was refused, under appendix FM  of  the
    'new Rules', in force from 9 July 2012: the  grounds  referred  to  the
    terms of the contact order. Since the appellant had only an  order  for
    indirect contact, he could not reasonably have succeeded at that  point
    under the relevant 'old Rule', paragraph 248A.  However  in  this  case
    nothing turns on the change in the Rules (as to which  see  Edgehill  &
    another [2014] EWCA Civ 402). The reason is that the  only  ground  for
    refusal under paragraph 248A (apart from the lack of a  contact  order,
    which is not in issue) was lack of satisfaction under sub-paragraph (v)
    that "the child visits or stays with the applicant on  a  frequent  and
    regular basis  and  the  applicant  intends  this  to  continue".  This
    provision no longer appears as a specific requirement in appendix FM E-
    LTPRT 2.4.

 4. The refusal under appendix FM referred also  to  lack  of  satisfaction
    that the appellant was taking, and intended  to  continue  to  take  an
    active rï¿½le in N's upbringing. It follows that the  relevant  rule  for
    present purposes (which appears without relevant difference in both the
    old and new versions) is this:

       E-LTRPT.2.4.

       (a)    ...

       (b)    The applicant must provide evidence that they are taking, and
          intend to continue to take, an active role in the child's
          upbringing.

 5. However, by the date  of  the  first-tier  hearing  on  16  April,  the
    position had changed: on 20 March  2014  an  order  was  made  for  the
    appellant  to  have  direct  contact  with  N,  in  these  terms:  "The
    respondent mother  shall  make  [N]  available  for  contact  with  the
    Applicant father at reasonable times by agreement". Clearly this was no
    more than an order for direct contact in principle, and  by  agreement:
    while the judge refers at paragraph 26 to its terms 'described  above',
    I cannot see where she has done so.

 6. The judge's main finding of fact on the paragraph 248A refusal  appears
    at paragraph 26: she noted the very recent order  for  direct  contact,
    and went on:

       However, as far as the appellant taking an active role in the child's
       upbringing is concerned  and  his  intention  to  do  so,  I  am  not
       satisfied that there is sufficient evidence available  ...  Since  20
       March 2014 there has been one visit and although others  are  planned
       and the appellant has expressed an intention to move to be  near  his
       daughter, as yet they are no  more  than  plans  or  aspirations.  At
       present there is no evidence of the child staying with the  appellant
       on a frequent and regular basis as required by the rule.

 7. On that basis, the judge found against the appellant, both on  the  old
    rule (paragraph 248A (v)) and the new one (E-LTRPT.2.4. (b)).  She  did
    so on the basis that

       If as submitted, Appendix FM applies, then I make the  same  findings
       in relation to paragraph E-LTRPT.2.4.

 8. While the judge went on to deal with the lack of evidence of  telephone
    contact since the  order  for  indirect  access  in  2012,  or  of  the
    appellant's being consulted or having  made  any  decisions  about  N's
    upbringing, and  made  further  findings  under  article  8,  she  also
    declined to allow the appeal under that head, on the basis that

       There is insufficient evidence at present for me to be satisfied that
       there are compelling circumstances in existence here.

 9. In my view, what the judge needed to  do  was  first  to  consider  the
    appeal under the only relevant rule which the appellant was required to
    satisfy by the  date  of  the  decision  under  appeal,  which  was  E-
    LTRPT.2.4. (b), without reference  to  what  had  been  required  under
    paragraph 248A (v). The current rule is expressed in the present tense,
    directing the decision-maker both to what is happening now, and to  the
    future, so far as it  concerns  the  appellant's  intentions;  and  the
    direct contact order was very recent, with no set terms.

10. The judge was not helped  by  the  position  taken  by  the  presenting
    officer (not Mrs Pettersen), who argued that the only relevant rule was
    paragraph 248A; nor by the difficulties posed by the way in  which  the
    'old Rules' have been incorporated into the new ones. It was  also  not
    an easy task for the judge to assess both whether the appellant was now
    taking,  and  intended  in  future  to  take  an  active  role  in  N's
    upbringing. However she did need to do so without negative reference to
    the lack of visiting or staying access in the past, when the  appellant
    had been forbidden it by order of the family court. To that extent, and
    no further, I take the view that her decision was wrong in law.  As  it
    happens, the appellant did move from Barking  to  Keighley  later  that
    month (April this year) to be nearer his daughter, though the judge was
    not wrong to treat that as no more than a  plan  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing.

11. On the basis of that error of law, understandable as it was in what was
    otherwise a very impressive and  careful  decision,  the  parties  were
    agreed that this case should be re-heard by another judge, this time at
    Bradford. That hearing has already  been  listed  for  18  August.  The
    appellant will be then be able to show, calling N's mother to give oral
    evidence unless there is some unforeseeable reason  why  not  (and  his
    representatives are reminded that witness summonses are  available,  if
    necessary), on the facts of what has taken place since  the  order  for
    direct contact was made on 20 March, how far he has taken advantage  of
    it, and how far he by the date of the hearing is taking, and intends to
    continue to take an active interest in N's upbringing. While the  order
    may have no set terms, the appellant may reasonably be expected to show
    that he has taken every possible  opportunity  to  achieve  the  direct
    contact ordered in principle.

Appeal
Fresh hearing at Bradford, not before  Judge  Griffith,  on  basis  set  out
    above
