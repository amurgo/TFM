For the claimants:     Mr S Archarjee, instructed by J Stifford Law
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Buckwell  promulgated  26.10.15,  dismissing  on
    immigration grounds but allowing on human rights grounds the claimants'
    linked appeals the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 7.7.14, to
    refuse their applications for further leave to remain in the  UK  as  a
    Tier 4 student (the first claimant) and dependent wife and son  (second
    and third claimants), and to  remove  them  from  the  UK  pursuant  to
    section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 1.10.15.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge Martin, sitting  as  a  judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, granted permission to appeal on 21.4.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me for an error of law hearing on 3.6.16 as
    an appeal in the Upper Tribunal.

 4. As set out in my error of law decision, promulgated  23.6.16,  I  found
    such error of law in the making  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as to require the decision of Judge Buckwell to be  set  aside
    and remade. I reserved the remaking of the decision to  myself  in  the
    Upper Tribunal, giving leave for further evidence to be adduced  as  to
    the claimants' current circumstances in the UK.

 5. The resumed hearing was listed before me at  Field  House  on  21.7.16.
    Despite my directions that there should be a  single  consolidated  and
    paginated bundle, Mr Archarjee relied  on  two  separate  bundles:  the
    original bundle, unhelpfully marked as sections A  to  H,  rather  than
    simply paginated. Mr Archarjee also relied on a so-called supplementary
    bundle, marked in similar style, J to O.

 6. Before making any of my findings of fact, I have  carefully  considered
    all documents  placed  before  me,  from  both  bundles,  including  in
    particular the adult claimants' unsigned witness statements of  26.5.16
    in the first bundle, and those of 18.7.16 in the supplementary bundle.

 7. After hearing  further  oral  evidence  from  both  adult  claimants  I
    reserved my decision, which I now give.

 8. A typed note of the oral evidence of the two adult  claimants  and  the
    submissions of the representatives is with the case papers.

 9. I bear in mind  that  generally  the  burden  of  proof  rests  on  the
    claimants, on the balance of probabilities. However, under any  article
    8 proportionality assessment the burden lies on the Secretary of  State
    to demonstrate that removal is proportionate  to  the  article  8  ECHR
    private and family life rights of the claimants.

The Background

10. The relevant  background  can  be  summarised  as  follows.  The  first
    claimant came to the UK with leave as a Tier 4 student.  His  wife  and
    son are dependants on his claim, and their appeals stand or  fall  with
    his. In May 2014 the first claimant applied for further leave to remain
    as a Tier 4 student. His application was refused because he  failed  to
    meet the requirement under paragraph 245ZX(c)  to  show  competence  in
    English language at  minimum  CEFR  level  B2  and  to  prove  this  by
    production of an original certificate from an approved English language
    test provider. He failed to submit the required  original  certificate.
    In consequence, he failed to qualify under Appendix A for the necessary
    30 points for a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies. The application
    was refused on 7.7.14.

11. The first claimant's case was that because of illness he was unable  to
    sit all  the  English  language  components  at  Trinity  College.  The
    application was submitted without the necessary  documentary  evidence,
    as at that time not all the component English language certificates had
    not been obtained. However, the CAS was sent after the application,  on
    27.6.14, but the missing English language result was  published  online
    on 26.6.14 and then sent electronically to the Home Office. However, as
    no original certificate had been received the application  was  refused
    on 7.7.14.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

12. In the First-tier Tribunal appeal, Judge Buckwell concluded at �32 that
    the  first  claimant  failed  to  satisfy  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules, as all original documents were  not  submitted  with
    the application and were not received by the date the decision  on  the
    application was made by the Secretary of State.

13. However, Judge Buckwell, who evidently had  considerable  sympathy  for
    the first claimant, went on to allow the appeal on human rights grounds
    on the basis that all requirements had in effect been met by  the  date
    of the decision of the Secretary of State. At �39 the  judge  concluded
    "I believe this to be a rare  case  where  the  interference  with  the
    private life rights enjoyed by the First (claimant) cannot be justified
    by the respondent being lawfully entitled to  rely  upon  Article  8(2)
    ECHR." The judge allowed the appeal on the basis that the decision  was
    disproportionate.

The Error of Law

14. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Martin found it  arguable  that
    the judge erred in failing to identify the circumstances  justifying  a
    consideration  of  article  8  outside  the  Rules,  and  secondly   in
    misdirecting himself as to the wording of section 117B(5) at �35 of the
    decision.

15. Although allowing the appeal on human rights grounds  under  article  8
    ECHR  private  and  family  life,  the  judge  omitted  to   make   any
    consideration of the family and private life Rules of Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE, before going on to article 8 ECHR.

16. Further, before article 8 ECHR can be considered outside the  Rules  an
    appellant must demonstrate that there  are  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as  to  justify
    granting leave to remain outside Rules under article  8  ECHR,  on  the
    basis that the decision is unjustifiably harsh. In SSHD v SS (Congo)  &
    Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, the Court of Appeal re-stated the context  and
    considered the role of public policy as expressed in the Rules  in  the
    proportionality assessment. The decision maker is  entitled  to  decide
    that Article 8 considerations have been fully addressed  in  the  Rules
    when dealing with 'stage two'.  If they have, it is enough to  say  so.
    This will necessarily involve deciding whether there is a 'gap' between
    the Rules and Article 8, and then whether there  are  circumstances  in
    the case under consideration which take it outside the class  of  cases
    which the Rules properly provide for.  Whether these circumstances  are
    described  as  'compelling'  or  'exceptional'  is  not  a  matter   of
    substance.  They must be relevant, weighty, and not fully provided  for
    within the Rules.  In practice they are likely to  be  both  compelling
    and exceptional, but this is not a legal requirement.  The first stage,
    therefore, is to assess how completely  the  Rules  reflect  Article  8
    considerations.


17. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  identify  any  compelling
    circumstances but went straight to  a  human  rights  assessment  under
    article 8 ECHR. However, even  in  that  assessment  the  decision  was
    fatally flawed.


18. First, it appears that the judge allowed the appeal on the  basis  that
    the first claimant was a good student with adequate funds. Even  though
    he did not provide the required documents  with  his  application,  not
    even before the  decision  was  made,  the  judge  considers  that  the
    Secretary of State should have delayed making the decision, should have
    made enquiries about his  claimed  illness  (in  respect  of  which  no
    evidence was  adduced),  and  because  by  the  date  of  decision  the
    Secretary of State knew that  he  met  the  English  language  and  CAS
    requirements.


19. In effect, the First-tier Tribunal judge used article 8  as  a  general
    dispensing power to excuse compliance with the Immigration  Rules.  The
    judge failed to take account of Patel, referenced in  the  decision  at
    �33, which reminded judges that article 8 is not a  general  dispensing
    power and that the opportunity for a promising student to complete  his
    course in this country, however desirable in general terms, is  not  in
    itself a right protected under article 8.


20. In Nasim and others (article 8) [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical  removal  of  the  22  PBS
    claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case
    must  be  determined  on  its  merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity."


21. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."


22. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:  "Whilst  the  concept  of  a
    "family life" is generally speaking readily identifiable,  the  concept
    of a "private life" for the purposes of Article 8  is  inherently  less
    clear.  At one end of the "continuum" stands the concept of  moral  and
    physical  integrity  or  "physical  and  psychological  integrity"  (as
    categorised by the ECtHR in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002)  35  EHRR
    1) as to which, in extreme instances,  even  the  state's  interest  in
    removing  foreign  criminals  might  not  constitute  a   proportionate
    response.  However, as one moves down  the  continuum,  one  encounters
    aspects of private life which, even if engaging Article  8(1)  (if  not
    alone, then in combination with other factors) are so far removed  from
    the "core" of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state interests,
    such as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system of
    immigration control."


23. The panel pointed out  that  at  this  point  on  the  continuum,  "the
    essential elements of the private  life  relied  on  will  normally  be
    transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in  their
    essential respects, following a person's return to their home  country,
    (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its limited utility to an individual where
    one has moved along the continuum, from that  Article's  core  area  of
    operation towards what might be described as its  fuzzy  penumbra.  The
    limitation arises, both from what will at that point  normally  be  the
    tangential effect on the individual of the  proposed  interference  and
    from the fact that, unless there are particular reasons to  reduce  the
    public interest of enforcing immigration controls, that  interest  will
    consequently prevail in  striking  the  proportionality  balance  (even
    assuming that stage is reached)."


24.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  provided  no  sufficient
    justification in law for allowing the appeal on article 8 private  life
    grounds. However,  even  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise  was
    flawed.


25. At �35 the First-tier Tribunal judge acknowledged section 117B  of  the
    2002 Act and that  immigration  control  is  in  the  public  interest.
    However, the judge in error of law failed to properly consider that the
    claimants' immigration status was  at  all  times  precarious  so  that
    little weight should be given to their private life in the UK, pursuant
    to AM Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC). The judge  misdirected  himself  in
    law when he stated that this provision does not apply as the  appellant
    was seeking to extend his leave for educational purposes. Neither  does
    the  claimant  obtain  any  credit  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise for being able to speak English or being a  good  student,  or
    because he is financially independent of  the  state.  This  ground  of
    appeal is made out.


26. Applying the above guidance and case authority, it is  clear  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed for  error  of  law  and
    cannot stand.


The remaking of the decision in the appeal


27. First, it is clear that none of the claimants can meet the requirements
    of the Rules for leave to remain in the capacity sought.


28. I reject Mr Archarjee's submission that  paragraph  245AA  should  have
    applied so as to require the Secretary of State to  await  the  English
    language certificate and/or  CAS  before  making  the  decision.  245AA
    provides that specified documents must be provided with the application
    and that the Secretary of State will only consider documents  submitted
    after the application in certain defined circumstances  set  out  under
    paragraph 245AA.


29. In this application the claimant failed to submit the original  English
    language  document  with  the  application.  245AA  makes  clear   that
    documents will not be requested where a specified document has not been
    submitted, with a missing English  language  certificate  cited  as  an
    example. 245AA does not assist the claimants. Neither do I accept  that
    the decision was procedurally unfair.


30. It is also clear that none of the claimants can meet  the  requirements
    of either Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules  for
    leave to  remain.  None  of  them  meet  the  Appendix  FM  eligibility
    requirements in relation to settled status in the UK. Even if  EX1  was
    considered, there is nothing on the  facts  of  this  case  that  would
    amount to insurmountable obstacles, as defined by  EX2,  to  continuing
    family life in Bangladesh, where they would return to as a family unit.
    Employment or accommodation concerns, or the lack of support  from  the
    wider  family  are  factors  that  cannot  possibly  be  construed   as
    insurmountable to family life continuing in Bangladesh. The family life
    of this family in the UK was entirely precarious in the  sense  of  any
    expectation of being able to enjoy the continuation of family  life  in
    the UK.


31. Further, none of the claimants can show sufficient length of  residence
    in the UK to meet paragraph 276ADE, or that there are very  significant
    obstacles  to  their  integration  into  Bangladesh,  where  the  adult
    claimants have lived most of their lives, speak the language, and  have
    retained undoubted cultural ties and family ties, if  not  also  social
    ties. I note that  they  claim  that  their  relationship  with  family
    members has gradually decreased, but it is not suggested they are  non-
    existent.


32. As as this is an in-country application in remaking the decision in the
    appeal I have to consider the circumstances prevailing at the  date  of
    the re-making, which I have done. I take into account  that  the  first
    claimant came to the UK in 2007 and their child born in the UK is now 5
    years of age. I have also taken  account  as  a  primary  consideration
    under section 55 of the best interests of the claimants' child, who  is
    doing well at school and who has never lived in Bangladesh. However, he
    does not meet the 7 years' threshold requirement of  paragraph  276ADE.
    It is undoubtedly the case that  the  child's  best  interests  are  to
    remain with his parents and if  the  parents  are  to  be  removed  the
    starting point in respect of the child is that  he  should  be  removed
    along with his parents. Other than the fact that he has started  school
    and will have some associations with friends arising  from  that  fact,
    and that he will probably speak English well, there are no factors that
    would suggest the best interests of the child are to remain in the  UK.
    He has no right to live, settle or be educated in the UK. He  is  young
    enough and will have the support of his family to adapt and  settle  in
    Bangladesh and learn Bengali.


33. I take into account the claimants' degree of connection to the UK  with
    associations with friends and others in the UK that  has  arisen  since
    2007, as well as the letters of reference  and  support.  However,  the
    adult claimants came to the UK  with  the  intention  of  returning  to
    Bangladesh on completion of studies. They had and  have  no  legitimate
    right to expect to be able to  settle  in  the  UK.  Their  immigration
    status was always precarious and having a child born in the UK does not
    change that position.


34. Whilst  the  claimants  assert  they  will  find  difficulties  finding
    employment and have no property or assets to return to, that is not the
    test for leave to remain in the UK. It is not the responsibility of the
    UK to ensure that they have a lifestyle  or  can  live  comfortably  in
    Bangladesh. They have skills and  education  that  they  can  apply  to
    providing for themselves.


35. I note from the latest witness  statements  that  various  matters  are
    raised that appear  to  be  an  asylum  claim.  Reference  is  made  to
    religious extremists, and rival political factions, and that the  adult
    claimants do not feel safe in  returning  to  Bangladesh.  However,  no
    asylum claim has been made and  these  references  do  not  allow  this
    Tribunal to assess risks on return  unless  there  has  been  a  proper
    application to the Secretary of State and decision in  respect  of  any
    such application.


36. Frankly there is nothing particularly rare or even remarkable at all in
    the oral evidence or witness statements that is or would  or  could  be
    properly described as compelling or exceptional  circumstances.  I  can
    see no gap between the Rules in relation to private and family life and
    article 8 ECHR. In my view, there is no basis to  find  that  leave  to
    remain  outside  the  Rules  is   justified   because   of   compelling
    circumstances inadequately recognised under the Rules, so as to  render
    the removal decision unjustifiably harsh. I find no reason to  consider
    article 8 outside the Rules on the facts of this case.


37. In any event, even if I were to consider article 8 outside  the  Rules,
    under a Razgar staged approach, the appeal would be bound to fail.

38.  First,  I  find  that  there  is  no  interference  with  family  life
    sufficiently serious as to engage article 8, as the claimants  will  be
    removed together and do not claim to have any other family  connections
    in the UK, but they have family in Bangladesh, even  if  their  contact
    with those family members has diminished over the years.

39. In respect of private life, section 117B of the 2002 Act provides  that
    immigration control is in the public interest and  that  little  weight
    should be given to any private life developed  in  the  UK  whilst  the
    claimants' immigration status was precarious, as  it  was.  In  effect,
    residence in the UK as student and dependents does not,  without  more,
    accumulate private life rights enforceable under article  8,  as  their
    removal does not impinge on the moral and  physical  integrity  of  the
    claimants. They are free to develop their private  life  in  Bangladesh
    and maintain contact with friends in the UK  through  modern  means  of
    communication and occasional visits. That the claimants  speak  English
    or are financially independent of state support is irrelevant  to  this
    consideration, as stated above.

40.  Taking  the  evidence  as  a  whole,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  any
    interference with their private life which will be occasioned by  their
    removal is sufficiently serious to engage the protection of  article  8
    ECHR. However, in the proportionality balancing exercise between on the
    one hand the claimants' private (and family) life and on the other  the
    legitimate and necessary aim to protect the economic well-being of  the
    UK through immigration control, it is clear that  the  removal  of  the
    claimants would not be disproportionate, for the reasons stated above.

Decision

                    The  appeal  of  each  claimant  is  dismissed  on  both
                    immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
