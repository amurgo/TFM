                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms K. Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Not represented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is a citizen of Nigeria
    born on 16 April 1987 whose application for a Derivative EEA Residence
    card under Regulation 15A(4A) of the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006
    ("the 2006 Regulations") was refused by the Secretary of State.


 2. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where her appeal was
    considered by Judge Boylan-Kemp without an oral hearing. The decision
    is dated 25 November 2016 and was promulgated on 29 November 2016.


 3. The judge found that the requirements of Regulation 15A(4A) were met
    and that consequently the claimant had a derivative right of residence
    in the UK.

 4. The grounds of appeal contend that on 15 November 2016 the Secretary of
    State sent by fax to the First-tier Tribunal a supplemental reasons for
    refusal letter along with a letter from the Passport Office concerning
    the revocation of the claimant's son's British passport but that no
    reference to these documents was made in the decision.


 5. The letter from the Passport Office referred to in the grounds of
    appeal is a letter dated 11 August 2016 to the claimant from HM
    Passport Office stating that her son has no entitlement, or statutory
    right, to have a UK passport, that his passport should not have been
    issued, and that it has now been revoked.


 6. Before me, Ms Pal reiterated the arguments made in the grounds of
    appeal.


 7. Ms Adeyi was not represented. She stated that she had not seen the
    letter of 11 August 2016 from the Passport Office. I gave her an
    opportunity to review it. She submitted that the only reason she had
    made the application was that she had wanted to attend a funeral in
    Nigeria and had mislaid her residence card. She stated that she had
    submitted to the Secretary of State everything required to obtain the
    residence card.


 8. Reading the decision as a whole, it is clear that the judge did not
    take into consideration the letter of 11 August 2016 from the Passport
    Office that was submitted by the Secretary of State on 15 November
    2016. Whether this was a mistake by the judge or (as is more likely)
    was because the document was not on the file when the judge considered
    the matter, the result is the same: the decision was made without
    having regard to material evidence. This is a material error of law and
    the decision cannot stand.


 9. In order to succeed under Regulation 15A(4A) the claimant must show,
    inter alia, that she is the primary carer of a British citizen. The
    only evidence before me on the question of the claimant's son's
    citizenship is a copy of a British passport and a letter from the
    Passport Office stating that this passport has been revoked as the
    claimant's son has no entitlement to it. In these circumstances, I am
    not satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the claimant's son
    is a British citizen. I therefore find that the requirements of
    Regulation 15A(4A) are not met and that, consequently, the claimant has
    not established that she has a derivative right of residence in the UK.






 Decision


 14. The First-tier Tribunal made a material error of law and the decision
 is set aside.








 15. I remake the decision by dismissing the claimant's appeal.
