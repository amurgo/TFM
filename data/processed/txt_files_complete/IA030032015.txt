                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against a decision made by Judge Andonian to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  Secretary  of  State
    that he should be removed following  his  conviction  in  2014  of  two
    serious offences, one of possession of class A  drugs  with  intent  to
    supply and the other of possession of a significant sum of  counterfeit
    money, some ï¿½900 or so.  This offence was committed on 13 November 2013
    when the appellant was in a car which was stopped by the police and the
    relevant drugs were found there.

2.   He was at that time, and it is important to note at that time,  a  drug
    user and it may well be that some of the drug, cocaine,  were  for  his
    own use but it clearly went beyond that and the  circumstances  of  the
    offending are recorded in the remarks of the judge who  sentenced  him.
    As far as the drugs were concerned, what was said was  that  he  was  a
    user of drugs and there were traces of cocaine on some scales that were
    found in  his  house  which  he  said  were  to  measure  for  his  own
    consumption but apparently his case was, and it does not seem that  the
    judge rejected this, that he owed a substantial sum of money to  a  man
    and he had sold a car on that man's behalf and received  the  money  in
    what turned out to be counterfeit notes and thus  he  still  owed  that
    money and he had the drugs because that man had required him to deliver
    them to another man and it was on that  basis,  as  we  say,  that  the
    sentence was passed. It amounted to  two  years  and  four  months  for
    possession of the  cocaine  with  intent  to  supply  and  four  months
    consecutive for the possession of the counterfeit currency.

3.   The appellant is a national of Lithuania.   There  was  a  considerable
    question over the immigration history which he  had  put  forward.   He
    said that he had come to this country in the late 1990s.   The  precise
    date has been difficult to ascertain but it seems  that  it  was  early
    1997, he having been here for a short period, he said, in 1996.  In any
    event he had apparently voluntarily left this country and when  he  had
    entered in the late 1990s he did claim asylum but that lapsed  when  he
    left the country.  It is not clear entirely when he re-entered  but  he
    produced evidence to the judge and to the Secretary  of  State  in  the
    form of revenue documentation which showed that he  had  been  in  this
    country save for the financial year 2008/2009  because  there  were  no
    documents for that particular year.  In those circumstances neither the
    Secretary of State nor the judge were satisfied that he had  been  here
    for a continuous period of five years because there had been a break on
    the evidence that he was able to provide.

4.   It seems to us that on the material that was before him the  judge  was
    entitled to take the view that that continuous period of five years had
    not been established and as  we  understand  it,  Ms  Muzira,  who  has
    appeared on behalf of the appellant, has not felt able to dispute that.
     She does say, however, that there was an error by the  accountant  and
    were this case to go back for reconsideration there would  be  evidence
    which filled that gap.  However, in our view it is not a matter that is
    vital in considering the appropriate course to adopt for this appeal.

5.   As the appellant is an EEA national and was  exercising  treaty  rights
    in this country his deportation on grounds of public policy,  which  is
    what is relied on here, has to show that there are substantial  reasons
    for deciding that he should not remain here and the basis is set out in
    paragraph 21 of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.   Paragraph
    21(5) provides so far as material:
         "Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy  or
         public security  it  shall,  in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this Regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles -
         (a)    the   decision   must   comply   with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;
         (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct
             of the person concerned;
         (c)  the personal conduct of the person concerned must represent  a
             genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one
             of the fundamental interests of society;
         ...
         (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do not in  themselves
             justify the decision."

6.   In order to justify deportation it is  important  to  note  that  there
    must be a genuine and present sufficiently serious threat affecting one
    of the fundamental interests of society.  Now we  recognise  of  course
    that if there were an indication that  this  appellant  was  likely  to
    reoffend or there was a strong  risk  of  his  reoffending  that  would
    suffice and no doubt if there were other conduct by him which justified
    that concern such conduct could  exist  if  there  was  material  which
    justified a conclusion that he was still likely to be a drug addict and
    thus involved in the drug world, if we may put it that  way,  and  thus
    there was a risk that he might involve himself in  supplying  drugs  to
    others.  Thus it is of great importance that consideration be given  in
    a case such as this to what evidence there is as to his future risk and
    importantly what steps if any he has taken in order to  deal  with  his
    drug addiction and to avoid the possibility of further offending.

7.   Before the judge evidence was produced which showed quite clearly  from
    prison records and upon the view taken by those  who  were  responsible
    first that he had taken steps to deal with his addiction.  He had  been
    working with a substance misuse team since May  of  2014  at  Maidstone
    Prison, had attended regular sessions, had completed what is called the
    Stepping  Stones  Drug  Programme  in  October  2014  and  was  equally
    continuing to attend that.  So he was clearly making an effort to  deal
    with his drug problem which is what had led to  his  offending  because
    there is no suggestion that, apart from that he had behaved when he was
    in this country, certainly from 2008 onwards, in a damaging way.

8.   Furthermore the assessment  of  the  likelihood  of  offending  on  his
    release was that the risk was small.  Accordingly in our judgment there
    was not only no evidence to justify the contention  that  there  was  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society but indeed the  evidence  was  to  the
    contrary.

9.   It is significant when one looks at  the  decision  of  Judge  Andonian
    that he asserts in the course of his judgment that the only reason  why
    the appellant had not taken drugs in prison was because they  were  not
    available.  That was a statement which not  only  had  no  evidence  to
    support it but was totally contrary to  the  evidence  that  there  was
    before him.  Furthermore he said in his judgment that the appellant had
    taken no steps to address his  drug  habit  whilst  in  prison,  again,
    totally contrary to the evidence.

10.  Furthermore, and this was the main basis upon  which  leave  to  appeal
    was  granted,  Judge  Andonian  nowhere  considered  the  question   of
    rehabilitation because of course the appellant  on  his  release  would
    have been required for the period which otherwise would constitute  the
    totality of his sentence to be under the supervision of  the  Probation
    Service to a degree and rehabilitation  clearly  can  be  an  important
    consideration.  It was not given any consideration by the judge and the
    decision of this Tribunal in Essa is a decision which has been approved
    in principle by the Court of Appeal.

11.  There can be no doubt that the decision  of  the  judge  is  one  which
    cannot stand.  We have had to consider therefore whether we should send
    this back for reconsideration or whether we  should  reach  a  decision
    ourselves.  For the reasons we have set out we are satisfied that  this
    is a case in which deportation in accordance with the 2006  Regulations
    cannot be justified.  In those circumstances this appeal is allowed and
    the decision of the Secretary of State is quashed.
