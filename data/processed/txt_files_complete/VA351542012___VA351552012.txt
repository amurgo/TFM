Representation:
For the Appellant:     Dr N Uhegwu for the appellants
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                                DETERMINATION

 1. The respondents to this appeal (hereinafter  "the  claimants")  appealed
    successfully to the first  tier  tribunal  a  decision  of  the  present
    appellant (hereinafter "the Entry  Clearance  Officer)  to  refuse  them
    entry clearance as family visitors.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer was given permission to appeal  because  the
    First-tier Tribunal thought, wrongly, that  it  was  arguable  that  the
    Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeals. For reasons  that
    are not clear permission to appeal was granted in both appeals  although
    the Entry Clearance Officer only challenged one of the decisions.

 3. Before us Mr Smart recognised that the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal was misconceived  and  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  case  is
    unarguable. Both claimants are within the narrow band of relatives  who,
    at the material time, could still appeal decisions to refuse them  leave
    to enter as visitors.

 4. In the premises we dismiss both of the appeals by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer that are before us.

 5. For the avoidance of doubt both claimants have shown that  they  satisfy
    the rules for admission to the United Kingdom as visitors and should  be
    allowed to enter the United Kingdom in accordance  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's findings.
