For the Appellant:     Mr Shibli instructed by Barnes Harrild & Dyer
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 1 January  1994  and
      he appealed against the decision of the respondent dated  1  September
      2011 refusing to grant him leave to remain in the UK and to refuse  to
      vary his leave to remain.

   2. The appellant initially claimed asylum on 10 March 2009 after arriving
      in the UK by means of a lorry with the assistance  of  an  agent,  but
      this claim was refused on 18th June 2009.   However,  he  was  granted
      discretionary leave as a minor until 1 July 2011.

   3. A decision to refuse to vary the appellant's leave to enter or  remain
      and a decision to remove him was made on 1 September 2011  and  it  is
      against that decision that the appellant appealed.

   4. In the refusal letter of 1st September 2011  the  Secretary  of  State
      recorded that the  appellant's  claim  for  asylum  had  already  been
      considered on 18th June 2009 and refused and  the  reasons  given  for
      refusing  his  claim  were  still   valid   and   relied   upon.   His
      representations dated 30th June 2011 were not considered to be a fresh
      claim for asylum as he had relied on the same grounds.   His claim was
      thus considered only under Humanitarian Protection  and  Human  Rights
      grounds. There did not appear to have been any form of judicial review
      of this decision and thus the appeal is restricted to those grounds.

   5. His appeal against the refusal of further leave  was  heard  by  First
      Tier Tribunal Judge Herlihy on 31 October 2011 and it  was  dismissed.
      He appealed to the Upper Tribunal and on 3 July 2012  the  appeal  was
      remitted back to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  re-hearing.   On  6
      December 2013 the appellant's solicitors queried the progress  of  the
      appeal and the case was listed on 4 April 2014  before  Judge  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Sharp.

   6. By the time the case was listed before Judge Sharp the  appellant  was
      20 years of age and described as "a mature young  man,  well  able  to
      express himself".

   7. The appellant claimed that his reason for coming to the UK was that he
      feared his father's enemies because his father had been in the Hezb-i-
      Islami as a commander.  The appellant returned  to  Afghanistan  after
      initially fleeing to Pakistan and found  out  that  his  enemies  were
      searching for him.  His father, as a commander  in  Hezb-i-Islami  and
      against the government, was shot dead in  2006.   The  appellant  then
      claimed his family were taken to prison where  they  stayed  for  some
      five to six months after which his father's friend, Shamshir  Khan,  a
      fellow Hezb-i-Islami Commander [SEF statement paragraph 15][AIR  q37],
      bribed the  guards  to  release  them  and  thereafter  they  went  to
      Pakistan.  They stayed for two and a half years until  they  travelled
      back to Afghanistan where Shamshir Khan told him the authorities  were
      still looking for him and he arranged for the appellant to  travel  to
      the UK.

   8. His claim was refused as the respondent doubted the credibility of his
      claim as he had failed to provide a credible, consistent and  accurate
      account of the events claimed and asserted that  he  could  internally
      relocate.

   9. At the hearing before Judge Sharp his  brother,  Ahmadullah  Jabarkhil
      and the appellant gave evidence and his  brother  confirmed  that  his
      father was killed in 2006 when he was away and the  security  services
      raided their house.

  10. It was submitted on behalf of the  respondent  that  even  taking  the
      claim at its highest and even if the appellant could not return to his
      home area, he could  relocate  to  Kabul  where  he  could  assimilate
      himself in that city.

  11. The judge also dismissed the Article 8 claim.

  12. An application for permission to appeal was submitted  to  the  First-
      tier Tribunal which was refused and  renewed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
      which established these grounds.

           Ground 1:   The passage of time does not attenuate risk;

           Ground 2:   The failure to consider the  risks  from  the  anti-
           government group;

           Ground 3:   Internal relocation;  The  Tribunal's  consideration
           of internal relocation failed to  take  into  account  that  the
           client  claimed  to  fear  the  Afghan   authorities   and   the
           authorities clearly operated in Kabul, and

           Ground 4:   There was an error in the assessment of family life.

  13. Application for permission to appeal was granted by Judge Hemingway on
      the basis that it was arguable that the  judge  erred  in  failing  to
      consider and determine the claim that the appellant would be  at  risk
      of forced recruitment by anti-government forces and that the judge did
      not give adequate reasons for finding that the appellant could  safely
      relocate to Kabul and it would not be unduly harsh to expect him to.

The Hearing




  14. At the hearing Mr Shibli stated that the judge  had  not  adopted  the
      right approach.  There had been evidence of previous difficulties  and
      the passage of time did not attenuate the risk.  The fact that he  had
      been targeted by the government in 2009 indicated he was still at risk
      as it was difficult to see how this had changed with five years.

  15. Further, there  was  nothing  in  respect  of  anti-government  groups
      contained in the determination.  This is  an  appellant  who  was  now
      educated abroad and questions would arise as to what he had been doing
      over the last five years.  He had been out if  the  country  for  some
      time.

  16. Mr Bramble submitted that there was a large number  of  documents  but
      very limited evidence on which the judge had to rely and the judge was
      entitled to accept paragraph 399K unless there were good  reasons  why
      the persecution would not be repeated.  Eight years had  passed  since
      that time.  The judge had not dealt  with  forcible  recruitment  from
      anti-government groups but this was not provided for in  the  skeleton
      argument.  There were brief references in paragraph 16 in the skeleton
      argument to the forcible  recruitment  and  in  paragraph  18  of  the
      skeleton argument in relation to Dr Giustozzi's evidence.  There was a
      further reference at  paragraph  19  in  relation  to  AA  (unattended
      children ) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016 IAC.  This however was not
      a child.

  17. The judge had looked at the evidence.  He had  not  mentioned  AK  but
      paragraph 34 was sufficient.

  18. The findings in relation to private life were also sufficient.

  19. Mr Shibli responded that it could not be the case that if the skeleton
      argument did not deal with something that the judge  should  not  deal
      with it.  It had been raised in the grounds of appeal.  There  was  no
      reference  to  AK  v  (Article  15(c))  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]   UKUT
      00163(First Tier Tribunal (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber))  or  to
      forcible recruitment.

  20. At this point the appellant gave oral testimony  and  he  stated  that
      everyone knew his family.  When he was  a  child  he  was  taken  into
      detention.  He stated there were no other commanders in  the  village.
      He had been detained with his family for six  months.   He  could  not
      return to Laghman which was his home area and that he could not return
      to Kabul because he was at risk of the government.  He knew  that  the
      authorities would find him because they had his father's pictures  and
      he took their pictures from when they were detained in 2006.  He  then
      confirmed this was the only reason that he would be known.

  21. Under cross-examination with Mr Bramble the appellant  confirmed  that
      he had last had contact with someone in Afghanistan in 2009.   It  was
      put to him that it was only his belief that if  he  went  back  people
      would try to persuade him to take on his father's role and  he  denied
      that this was the case.  He was asked who were  the  last  people  who
      tried to persuade him to join Hezb-i-Islami and he stated  the  people
      working with his father and they tried to persuade him after the death
      of his father.  It was put to the appellant that nowhere had  it  been
      stated by the appellant previously that he had been encouraged to join
      Hezb-i-Islami before he left and he stated no one had asked him.

  22. He was then asked at what point he was asked and he replied "in 2009".
       It was put to him that why was he just not taken if he was scared  of
      forcible recruitment and there was ample opportunity to take him.

  23. He stated that his village was one hour from Kabul.

  24. He was asked about when he was detained by the government as to why he
      was not killed in the six months and he merely  responded  that  money
      was paid to bribe him to get him out and that he had  been  questioned
      during this time.

Conclusions

  25. Judge Sharp at paragraph 29 of his determination took into account the
      fact that the appellant first gave his account when he was aged 15 and
      that he may  well  be  more  prone  to  making  mistakes  and  errors.
      However, he found  all  essential  core  elements  of  the  claim  had
      remained consistent.  He lived with his family and his father being  a
      commander and his father was killed.  He was taken out of the  country
      by his father's friend after that friend had  advised  the  family  to
      flee to Pakistan where they stayed for two and a half years.  He  made
      his way out of Afghanistan with the assistance of the father's  friend
      and he applied for asylum shortly after arriving in the UK.

  26. The judge found in his determination at [32]:

           "Having taken into account all the evidence  including  that  of
           the appellant's brother I am satisfied that the  relatively  low
           standard of proof required and bearing in mind the  age  of  the
           appellant at the time he entered this country and was  initially
           interviewed, that he has established that the  core  element  of
           his account is true.  I am  satisfied  that  his  father  was  a
           commander and was murdered most likely by  the  authorities  and
           that both his brother at the time of the murder and he some  two
           and a half years later when he  returned  as  a  young  man  had
           reason to fear the authorities by reason of his association with
           his father."

  27. The judge continues at [33]:

           "However those matters relate to 2009.  Much time has gone  past
           since then.  I am hearing this case some five  years  later.   I
           must consider whether being the son of an  assassinated  Hizb-i-
           Islami commander he would still be at risk from the  authorities
           should he return at the present time.  He is now aged 20.  He is
           a grown man.  He has been educated in the UK."

  28. In effect the judge stated that:

           "Since 2009 but even then some time has passed since the  actual
           murder itself.  The appellant has been  unable  to  produce  any
           evidence that after all this time the authorities would still be
           looking for him.  He claims to have lost all  contact  with  his
           family."

  29. The judge continued:

           "Mr Cooray was not able to refer me to  anything  other  than  a
           limited number of pages in the substantial bundles  produced  on
           his  behalf.   I  therefore  cannot  be   satisfied   that   the
           authorities would be looking for the appellant should he  return
           at this time."

    and at [34]:

           "I am satisfied that in the alternative that the appellant would
           be able to relocate  to  Kabul.   Kabul  is  a  substantial  and
           vibrant city rebuilding itself after years of  turmoil.   Things
           may not be perfect there and in particular  for  minor  children
           and sole women it may well be that it would be unsafe  for  them
           to  return.   However  the  appellant  is  a   young,   healthy,
           intelligent and articulate man who I am satisfied would be  able
           to make his way in Kabul and take advantage of the opportunities
           that  will  exist  in  the  city.   There  are   a   number   of
           organisations within Kabul to assist returning refugees."

  30. The judge was criticised for failing to  cite  AK  v  (Article  15(c))
      Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163(First Tier Tribunal (Immigration  and
      Asylum Chamber) and I find this could be an  error  specifically  with
      regard to risk as it is country guidance. Further although  the  judge
      referred to the risk from Hizb-e-Islami he gave very limited reasoning
      in respect of finding there was no risk and  failed  to  cite  PM  and
      Others (Kabul - Hizb-i-Islami)  Afghanistan  CG  [2007]  UKAIT  00089.
      Nonetheless I preserve those findings the judge did make with  respect
      to the appellant and  I  remake  the  decision  with  respect  to  the
      assessment of risk on return.

  31. Januzi (FC) v SSHD [2006] UKHL 5,  stated  that  in  relation  to  the
      question of whether it would be unduly harsh for the  claimant  to  be
      expected to live at a place of relocation within the  country  of  his
      nationality, that the relevant comparisons are between  those  in  the
      place of relocation and those that prevail elsewhere in his country of
      nationality.  If the claimant could live a relatively normal  life  by
      the standards that prevailed in his country of nationality  generally,
      and if he could reach the less hostile part without undue hardship  or
      undue difficulty it would not be unreasonable to expect  him  to  move
      there.



  32. AK confirmed that the security situation in Afghanistan was such  that
      relocation to Kabul was still an  option.   It  would  depend  on  the
      individual circumstances of the Appellant. It  is  necessary  to  take
      into account the level of violence in the city  and  the  difficulties
      experienced by that city's poor and also the many Internally Displaced
      Persons there but these  considerations  would  not  in  general  make
      return to Kabul unsafe or unreasonable.

  33. The judge found that the security situation was indeed such  in  Kabul
      that the appellant could be returned there.  I  can  accept  that  the
      passage of time alone may not attenuate risk, as the judge found  that
      the appellant had reason to fear 'when he returned' in  2009  but  the
      judge considered whether the appellant would be at risk in his village
      or in Kabul and he found that the appellant could relocate  to  Kabul.
      He considered whether he was at risk  from  the  authorities  or  'the
      danger he claims'.

  34. Although the judge did not cite AK, it confirms that there is a  level
      of safety in Kabul depending on the circumstances  of  the  appellant.
      The judge also made findings on the individual  circumstances  of  the
      appellant and found that the appellant was 'now aged 20' and a  'grown
      man'.   Considering the two dimensions, that of time  and  space,  the
      passage of time and geographical distance of Kabul,  would  allow  the
      appellant to reside in safety in Kabul. As the judge pointed out there
      was no specific information which indicated that the  appellant  would
      be targeted.

  35. I do not accept that AA (unattended children)  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]
      UKUT 00016 IAC applies to the appellant now.  I can accept that  there
      is no bright line but he is now the  age  of  20  years  old  and  has
      undergone the process  of  relocation  and  adapting  to  a  different
      country and this will have had a maturing effect on him. As  found  by
      Judge Sharp he is intelligent and articulate. Nor do I accept that  if
      the respondent has failed to track down the family this has prejudiced
      his case in any way. He claims his father was murdered and his brother
      in the UK.  His brother has yet to be granted status in  the  UK.   He
      too was given discretionary leave. Indeed the appellant's case is that
      he specifically did not want his family contacted.

  36. This appellant does not fall within the UNHCR  guidelines  as  someone
      particularly vulnerable. This Appellant is an adult male, who has been
      able to obtain visas, travel and enter the United Kingdom.

  37. The country  background  material  produced  does  not  undermine  the
      overall recent findings within AK as follows

           ...
            (ii) Despite a rise  in  the  number  of  civilian  deaths  and
           casualties  and  (particularly  in  the  2010-2011  period)   an
           expansion of  the  geographical  scope  of  the  armed  conflict
           in Afghanistan, the level of indiscriminate  violence  in  that
           country taken as a whole is not at such a high level as to  mean
           that, within the meaning of Article 15(c) of  the  Qualification
           Directive, a civilian, solely by being present in  the  country,
           faces a real risk which threatens his life or person.
           (iii) Nor is the level of indiscriminate violence, even  in  the
           provinces worst affected by the violence (which may now be taken
           to include Ghazni but not to include Kabul), at such a level.
           (iv) Whilst when assessing a claim in  the  context  of  Article
           15(c) in which the respondent asserts that Kabul city would be a
           viable internal relocation alternative, it is necessary to  take
           into account (both in assessing  "safety"  and  reasonableness")
           not only the level  of  violence  in  that  city  but  also  the
           difficulties experienced by that city's poor and also  the  many
           Internally  Displaced  Persons  (IDPs)   living   there,   these
           considerations will not in general make return to  Kabul  unsafe
           or unreasonable..

  38. Much of the documentation produced by the appellant's  representatives
      referred to pre 2011 situations. AK at paragraph 226 found those parts
      of Kabul city where returnees are most likely to live are 'the poorest
      areas of the city or its environs' and  have  been  less  affected  by
      indiscriminate violence, stating that the 'great majority [of attacks]
      have concentrated on  areas  where  the  government  or  international
      organisations have their offices or where their employees frequent'.

39. Further, at paragraph 225, the Tribunal also found that there was
    little evidence of significant numbers of the urban poor and IDP
    population in Kabul suffering destitution or inability to survive at
    subsistence levels.  It further noted that, whilst the importance of
    return and reintegration packages for UK returnees to Kabul should not
    be exaggerated, they did, nevertheless, place returnees in a better
    position than that of IDPs

  40. As the judge stated Kabul is a 'vibrant city rebuilding  itself  after
      years of turmoil' and the appellant is 'a  young  healthy  intelligent
      and articulate man who I am satisfied would be able to make his way in
      Kabul and take advantage of the opportunities that will exist  in  the
      city'. As indicated in this determination  I  find  the  appellant  is
      resourceful  and  is  an  adult  male  with  no   significant   health
      difficulties.  I do not find he is at risk under the UNHCR guidelines.
      As stated Kabul is a busy and vibrant city and I do not accept that he
      would be recognised as a newcomer bearing in mind  the  ever  changing
      population.

  41. I considered  the  appellant's  claim  that  the  Hizb-e-Islami  would
      forcibly recruit him and I do not accept that this is the case.    The
      country background material produced by the appellant  indicated  that
      in Laghman the Shura compete with the Hizb-e-Islami and  I  find  that
      the time of the insurgents would be spent fighting each  other  rather
      than searching for someone who was not in fact a member of the Hizb-e-
      Islami, had been absent from the area for 5 years and where  there  is
      indeed protection in the form of the government as indicated above.

  42. His father was murdered many years ago and a member of the local Hizb-
      e-Islami actively assisted the  appellant  with  his  passage  out  of
      Afghanistan, not once but twice.   This  person  was  described  as  a
      member of Hizb-e-Islami and there  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  any
      retribution was taken against him for assisting the appellant with his
      removal from Afghanistan. If  the  appellant  were  truly  wanted  for
      recruitment by the Hizb-e-Islami  I  find  that  he  would  have  been
      recruited prior to leaving for Pakistan and prior to leaving  for  the
      UK.

  43. He would not be returning to an area under the control of an AGE or an
      area where there is struggle for control (obviously  bearing  in  mind
      the securitised nature of Kabul) and although he may  be  of  fighting
      age I do not find he would be at risk in Kabul of forced  recruitment.
      I take into account AK, the country background material and  the  lack
      of any information in this specific matter about the reach of the Hizb-
      e-Islami into Kabul.

  44. RQ  (Afghan National Army  -  Hizb-i-Islami  -  risk)  Afghanistan  CG
      [2008] UKAIT 00013 found that there  could  be  safety  in  Kabul  for
      former soldiers from the risk  of  Hizb-e-Islami  and  the  safety  of
      internal relocation to Kabul is  a  question  of  fact  based  on  the
      particular history of an individual appellant and of  the  warlord  or
      faction known to be seeking to harm him.  There was no overall picture
      of those seeking to target the appellant and further  he  himself  was
      not a former soldier.

  45. Nor do I find he would be at risk from the government  or  he  has  an
      association with the Hizb-e-Islami such that he has  fought  for  them
      which would create a profile of risk.  Indeed he has  removed  himself
      from Afghanistan rather than join this group and the UNHCR  guidelines
      considered that those suspected of supporting AGEs may be in  need  of
      protection but this depended on their profile.   It  was  accepted  by
      Judge Sharp that the appellant's father had been a  Commander  in  the
      Hizb-e-Islami but I note the appellant has de facto distanced  himself
      from engagement with the Hizb-e-Islami and  indeed  spent  time  being
      educated in a Western country and applying for asylum.   He  does  not
      present as someone having committed any crimes whilst fighting. Indeed
      he can show that he has resisted forced  recruitment  by  the  Hizb-e-
      Islami.  The  suggestion  is  that  he  would  be  associated  by  the
      government with his father's politics but I do not  accept  that  this
      would be the perception of him now bearing in mind  the  time  elapsed
      and his background in the west.  He will be no different  to  many  of
      the population in Afghanistan and there is nothing to suggest that  he
      would be the target of indiscriminate violence.

  46. A Landinfo report dated 9th September  2011  by  Dr  A  Giustozzi  was
      produced.  This confirmed that the Afghan conflict  had  not  targeted
      civilians and such causalities had decreased.  Further  this  recorded
      under 'Attitude towards civilians of the parties in the conflict' that
      'episodes of targeting of civilians because of their association  with
      one of the parties in the conflict have been rare'.

  47. The appellant claimed that the government would have  an  interest  in
      him because he was kept in detention for six months. Not only was he a
      minor at this time but also he was  released.   If  he  were  of  real
      interest I do not accept he would be released.  in his  oral  evidence
      the appellant stated that the government would be able to identify him
      because of pictures taken at the time of detention.  I have  no  doubt
      that the appellant will have changed considerably since that time  but
      even if he did have pictures taken, and he was released  on  a  bribe,
      his subsequent actions will have removed  him  from  a  perception  of
      association with the Hizb-e-Islami.  He has taken no part in any armed
      struggle against the government.

  48. PM and Others (Kabul -  Hizb-i-Islami)  Afghanistan  CG  [2007]  UKAIT
      00089 accepted the  principle  that  time  could  attenuate  risk  and
      although acknowledging that it is not the role of the ISAF to  protect
      individuals, that there is an Afghan  army  and  a  police  force  and
      security services, that Kabul is not an entirely lawless place  and  a
      police force and security services exist in Kabul.  PM  addressed  the
      question of whether those associated with the Hizb-e-Islami  would  be
      at risk from the authorities and at [135] concluded

           'It has been suggested that someone who has been  involved  with
           Hizb i Islami will always be regarded as a member.  There is no
           satisfactory evidence to that effect.  There is evidence to  the
           contrary as illustrated by the MPs who  are  ex-Hizb i Islami.
           The fact that the appellants have been out of the country for so
           long suggests, on a common sense basis and in the light  of  the
           above, that their past conduct, without  more,  will  not  cause
           them serious difficulty.

      And     at     paragraph     136      the      Tribunal      continued






           'In summary, we have concluded that it has not been demonstrated
           that returnees such as the appellants [those with an association
           with Hizb-e-Islami] would be at  real  risk  in  Kabul.   It  is
           possible, but no more, that after they have  been  there  for  a
           period, their existence  would  become  known  to  the  security
           forces.  The evidence is that they would  not  be  suspected  of
           directly  knowing  anything  about  what  is  going  on  in  the
           insurgency although after a period, in common with  all  others,
           they may be asked questions about  what  they  know  from  their
           relatives  and  friends  and  their   own   personal   networks.
           ...Clearly, if such a  returnee  elects  to  become  active  for
           Hizb i Islami  the  situation  may  be  different,  but  these
           appellants are not being returned on the basis that that is what
           they will do.  After all, they came here to avoid that'.


  49. The appellant was not a member of Hizb-e-Islami and indeed  has  shown
      that he does not wish to be.  I do not  accept  that  the  authorities
      will presume thus that he wishes to take the place of  his  father.  I
      conclude that the appellant can safely return to Kabul and is  not  in
      need of asylum (although this is not in issue) humanitarian protection
      or protection further to Articles 2 and 3 of the  European  Convention
      for the reasoning given above.

  50. I find no error of law in the assessment by Judge Sharp in relation to
      Article 8.  The judge did not consider the Immigration Rules including
      Appendix FM or paragraph 276 ADE but there was no  challenge  on  this
      basis by the respondent.  The judge pursued the  assessment  following
      Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.  The judge found [35] that the appellant
      had re-established contact with his brother after not having seen  him
      for a number of years and 'furthermore  the  parties  are  not  living
      together'.   He  found  that  that  had  no  more  than  a   brotherly
      relationship and that they did not have a family life together.

  51. The private life of the appellant was considered.  The judge  accepted
      that the appellant had a private life and  addressed  proportionality.
      The judge's findings at [38] were brief but touched  on  the  relevant
      issues. The appellant would be returning to his country of origin, his
      private life had been built up during a period of uncertainty  in  the
      UK and although he entered as a  minor  his  asylum  claims  had  been
      rejected. The appellant had not put forward  more  cogent  reasons  or
      family life or relationships as to  why  he  should  not  be  removed.
      Clearly the judge was aware of the background of the case and that the
      appellant had only been in the UK since 2009 and was  given  temporary
      discretionary leave only. The judge took into account the relationship
      he had with his brother but found they could keep in  contact  through
      modern methods. The judge had also  found  that  the  appellant  could
      safely return to Kabul. The  reasons  are  adequate  with  respect  to
      Article 8 and I find no error in this respect of the determination and
      it shall stand.

  52. I have remade the determination with respect to assessment of risk  on
      return in relation to  Humanitarian  Protection  and  protection  with
      respect to Articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention and  I  dismiss
      the appellant's appeal on all grounds.
