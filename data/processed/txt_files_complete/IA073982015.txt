                              APPEAL ABANDONED

 1. This is the appellant's appeal of against the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Wedderspoon   promulgated   11.6.15,   dismissing   on
    immigration  grounds  but  allowing  on  human   rights   grounds   the
    appellant's appeal against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 27.1.15 to refuse leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 1.6.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox granted permission to appeal on 27.8.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 8.10.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. The appellant was granted 30 months leave to remain, in accordance with
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. As pointed out in the Secretary of State's Rule  24  response,  by  the
    operation of section 104(4A) of the 2002 Act, an appeal  under  section
    82(1) shall be treated as abandoned if the appellant is  granted  leave
    to remain in the UK.

 6. A faxed letter from the appellant's  representatives  expressly  agrees
    that the appeal should be treated as abandoned and thus  there  was  no
    attendance by or on behalf of the appellant at the hearing before me.

 7. There is thus no valid appeal before the Tribunal. By the operation  of
    Rule 17A of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  the
    Tribunal is required to notify

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been abandoned.
