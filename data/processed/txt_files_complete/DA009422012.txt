Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Duncan of Duncan Moghal Solicitors & Advocates
For the Respondent:    Mr K Hibbs, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither  party  invited
    me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who was born on  1  June  1977.   He
    claims to have arrived in the UK in February 2004 when he came  to  the
    attention of the UK authorities.  On 12 February 2004 he claimed asylum
    which was refused  on  2  April  2004.   The  appellant  unsuccessfully
    appealed and became appeals rights exhausted on 6 September 2004.

Introduction

 3. On 26 January 2012, the appellant was convicted at  the  Cardiff  Crown
    Court of a number of  offences  concerned  with  money  laundering  and
    possession of false documents.  He was sentenced to a  term  of  twelve
    months' imprisonment for  each  offence  to  run  concurrently.   On  1
    November 2012, the Secretary of State made a decision that  s.32(5)  of
    the UK Borders Act 2007 applied on the basis that the appellant  was  a
    "foreign criminal" under the 2007 Act.  The Secretary of State  made  a
    deportation order against the appellant.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 14 January 2013, the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Colyer
    and Mrs R M Bray JP) dismissed the appellant's  appeal.   The  Tribunal
    dismissed the appeal on asylum  and  related  international  protection
    grounds.  That decision is unchallenged.   In  addition,  the  Tribunal
    concluded that the appellant had failed to establish a  breach  of  the
    new Immigration Rules (in particular para 398  and  399)  or  that  his
    deportation would breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and  on
    21 February 2013 Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal.

 6. The appeal initially came before Upper Tribunal Judge Storey.   He  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal on the basis that it  had
    erred in law in two respects.  First, the panel had failed properly  to
    conduct an assessment of the best interests of  the  appellant's  child
    (BK).   Secondly,  the  Tribunal  had  wrongly  applied  the  so-called
    Zambrano principle (Ruiz Zambrano v Office National de l'Emploi (Case C-
    34/09))  by  assuming  that  BK's  primary  carer  was   his   maternal
    grandmother who  had  taken  over  his  care  when  the  appellant  was
    imprisoned.  Whilst that might have been  a  valid  assumption  if  the
    appellant had been sentenced to a lengthy period  of  imprisonment,  it
    was not an assumption that could be made where the sentence was  twelve
    months in duration.

 7. Following UTJ  Storey's  decision  on  6  June  2013,  the  appeal  was
    adjourned in order that an independent report from a social  worker  or
    other appropriate professional could be obtained on the issue  of  BK's
    best interests.  On behalf of  the  appellant,  a  report  of  Angeline
    Seymour, an experienced approved social worker specialising  in  mental
    health work dated 20 September 2013 was filed with the Upper  Tribunal.



 8. The resumed hearing was listed before me on 7 October 2013 in order  to
    remake the decision in respect  of  the  application  of  the  Zambrano
    principle and under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Submissions

 9. The parties' representatives made brief and succinct submissions before
    me.

10. Mr Duncan, on behalf of  the  appellant,  relied  upon  the  report  of
    Angeline Seymour.  He submitted that it established that the  appellant
    was the primary carer of BK and so the Zambrano principle applied.   He
    submitted that the Zambrano issue was intertwined with the Art 8 issue.
     He submitted that BK's grandmother was  only  his  carer  because  the
    appellant had been in prison.  On the basis of this report  it  was  on
    BK's best interests to live with his father and the report showed  that
    BK's grandmother would be unable  to  cope  and  her  already  existing
    health condition would deteriorate if BK continued to  live  with  her.
    Mr Duncan acknowledged, when I put the point to him, that the  Zambrano
    principle still required, even if it applied, to be considered  in  the
    context of proportionality.  Both as regards  EU  law  and  Art  8,  Mr
    Duncan succinctly submitted that the appellant's offence was  not  "the
    most serious" with a term of imprisonment of twelve months.

11. Mr Hibbs referred me to [66] and [67] of Ahmed [2013] UKUT  0089  (IAC)
    as setting out the Zambrano principle,  namely  that  it  only  applied
    where the effect of the decision: "Would lead to a  situation  where  a
    Union citizen child would have to leave the territory  of  the  Union".
    Mr Hibbs submitted that Zambrano did not apply as BK  could  be  looked
    after by his grandmother and would not be forced to leave the Union.

12. In relation to Art 8, Mr Hibbs submitted that  the  balance  should  be
    struck in favour of deportation.  He submitted that the  appellant  was
    not living with his son.  The social worker's report was silent on  who
    was the primary carer and BK's grandmother was a suitable  alternative.
    He pointed out that, even though the appellant was out  of  prison,  he
    was not living with BK.  Mr Hibbs relied  upon  the  case  of  Omotunde
    [2011] UKUT 00247 (IAC) which, he submitted, was very  similar  on  its
    facts.  Mr Hibbs submitted that although the appellant had a  low  risk
    of offending, he had been convicted of a "very serious offence".

13. In reply, Mr Duncan submitted that the appellant was  living  close  to
    his son and his son's grandmother in order to allow  for  a  "seamless"
    transition.  Mr Duncan submitted that the  appellant  was  putting  the
    interests of his son before himself so as not to  harm  BK  should  the
    case go against him.  In relation to the offending, Mr Duncan submitted
    that it was wrong to characterise the appellant's  offending  as  "very
    serious".

Discussion

14. A number of matters were resolved by the First-tier  Tribunal  and  are
    now not  challenged.   First,  the  appellant  cannot  succeed  in  his
    international  protection  claim  whether  for   asylum,   humanitarian
    protection or under Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR.  Secondly, the First-tier
    Tribunal's finding that the appellant cannot meet the  requirements  of
    paras 398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules stands.

15. The crucial issues, as identified in the submissions made to me by both
    parties, are as follows.  First, can the appellant rely on the Zambrano
    principle?  Even if he can, the Tribunal recognised  in  Omotunde  that
    the non-national parent's right  of  residence  under  EU  law  is  not
    absolute.  Rather, it is subject to  the  Community  law  principle  of
    proportionality.  There is no substantial difference between the  human
    rights based assessment of proportionality under Art 8 of the ECHR  and
    that required by EU law.  Secondly, even if the appellant  cannot  rely
    upon the Zambrano principle, is it  established  that  the  appellant's
    deportation would breach Art 8 of the ECHR?

16. The Zambrano principle recognises that a non-national parent may have a
    right to reside under Art 20 TFEU where  a  decision  would  otherwise:
    "deprive [a child] of the genuine enjoyment of  the  substance  of  the
    rights attaching to the status of European Union Citizen." [45].   That
    would arise, for example, where the effect of a decision  would  be  to
    require or force the EU national child to leave the  EU.   In  Harrison
    (Jamaica) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1736, the Court  of  Appeal  concluded
    that the Zambrano principle only applied where the  EU  national  child
    would be de facto compelled to leave.  It was  not  engaged  where  the
    level of interference  with  the  right  to  enjoy  the  status  of  EU
    citizenship was rendered less  advantageous,  beneficial  or  enjoyable
    alone.

17. In this appeal, the appellant was the primary carer for  BK  before  he
    was convicted and sentenced to a twelve month period of imprisonment on
    26 January 2012.  The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal,  and  it
    is not doubted before me, was that the appellant's wife  (BK's  mother)
    had, in effect, abandoned him  to  live  in  North  Africa  after  they
    separated in July 2009.  She has subsequently married  and  spends  the
    majority of her time there.  It was not suggested before me  that  BK's
    mother was a potential future carer for BK.

18. Before me, the issue came down to whether BK's primary carer should  be
    seen as his grandmother or his father.  In stepping in to care  for  BK
    whilst the appellant was in prison, BK's grandmother  took  on  a  role
    which had previously been that of the appellant.   She  had  only  done
    this because the appellant had been imprisoned.  Had  he  not  been  in
    prison, it is clear that the appellant would have carried  on  as  BK's
    primary carer.  The contrary has  not  been  suggested.   The  evidence
    (referred to in the social worker's report) is  that  BK's  grandmother
    had cared for BK's half-brother since he was about 2 and he was born in
    February 2003.

19. In determining  whether  the  Zambrano  principle  is  engaged,  it  is
    important in my judgment to consider the reality of BK's  circumstances
    and his best interests.

20. As regards the former, and again this was not challenged by  Mr  Hibbs,
    the appellant has not taken on the role of primary carer (in the  sense
    of having BK live with him) since he was released from  prison  because
    he does not want to risk any damage to BK if, in fact, he is  deported.
    Consequently, he has left BK with BK's grandmother  although  he  lives
    close by and  he  is  seeking  somewhere  suitable  for  them  to  live
    together.

21.  In  my  judgment,  the  separation  of  the  appellant  from  BK  was,
    necessarily, forced upon him by his imprisonment.  He was  and,  in  my
    judgment, would have remained, his primary carer.  His decision not  to
    do so on being released from prison  is,  in  my  view,  borne  of  his
    concern for BK's best interests.

22. If one looks at what are BK's best interests, the  report  of  Angeline
    Seymour is indicative.  I will not set out the report in  detail.   Its
    contents were not challenged by Mr Hibbs.  It clearly sets out  a  very
    close relationship between the appellant and BK.   It  also  reports  a
    very clear impact upon BK of being separated  from  his  father.   That
    separation caused distress and difficulties for BK.  Since his father's
    release, BK's wellbeing has undoubtedly improved.  Positive change  has
    been noticed by his teacher in school over the last  few  months.   His
    teacher describes BK as being "more confident in class"  and  "able  to
    answer more questions" and to be "interacting more".

23. Angeline Seymour also deals (in section  7  of  her  report)  with  the
    effect upon BK's  grandmother  if  the  appellant  is  deported.   BK's
    grandmother suffers from fibromyalgia and is registered disabled.   Her
    house has been adapted and to assist her she  has  been  provided  with
    crutches to make mobility easier.  She experiences fatigue, pain in her
    back, hips and shoulders as  well  as  low  mood.   She  is  prescribed
    painkillers and other medication by her  GP  to  manage  her  symptoms.
    BK's grandmother suffers from  poor  physical  health  which  makes  it
    difficult for her to play  with  her  grandchildren.   She  also  feels
    exhausted by her poor health and caring for her two young grandchildren
    and some days is unable to care  for  BK,  for  example  during  school
    holidays, and he goes to friends in Cardiff to give his  grandmother  a
    rest.  The report  also  refers  to  a  time,  during  the  appellant's
    imprisonment, when BK's grandmother asked BK's mother to assist her and
    BK went to stay with his mother.  It is not entirely  clear,  but  this
    appears to have been somewhere in the UK.  However, it is reported that
    BK did not settle at his mother's house and his grandmother was  forced
    to collect him because he  became  inconsolable.   As  I  have  already
    indicated, it was not suggested that BK's mother is a  suitable  future
    primary carer because her principal home is in North Africa  where  she
    lives with her new husband and baby.

24. Angeline Seymour's report clearly  establishes,  in  my  judgment,  the
    importance of the  appellant  to  BK  as  his  effective  sole  parent.
    Equally, the report expresses the opinion (with  which  I  agree)  that
    BK's grandmother could not be seen as a long-term carer  for  BK  given
    her physical health.  It is clear to me that BK's father  is  both  his
    natural parent and the person with whom it is in his  "best  interests"
    to live.  It is only circumstances (albeit of his own making) that have
    resulted in BK's father not being his primary carer.  I quote, and rely
    upon, the concluding remarks of Angeline Seymour as follows:

         "Finally, in my experience as a mental health practitioner  and  on
         the basis of my assessment of the issues and problems  this  family
         have personally, if this situation is not resolved  in  a  positive
         way, it would lead to deterioration in the wellbeing of  [BK]  both
         physically and psychologically.  The overall emotional cost to this
         child and his future would be great.  I am concerned that there  is
         a real risk of this  eventuality  on  the  basis  of  what  I  have
         observed and what has been reported to me.

         I am of the opinion that the permanent removal of  [the  appellant]
         from the UK is likely to cause significant detriment  to  [BK]  and
         also on the integrity of the family unit as a  whole  with  lasting
         and damaging effects particularly on this child."

25. In my judgment, the Zambrano principle is engaged in this appeal.   The
    effect of the appellant's deportation would be, in the  light  of  BK's
    best interests and the physical condition of his grandmother, to  force
    him to leave the EU in order to live  with  the  appellant.   That,  he
    cannot be expected to do under EU law as he has a  right  of  residence
    under EU law.  Likewise,  therefore,  the  appellant  has  a  right  of
    residence under EU law.

26. In Omotunde the Upper Tribunal accepted  that  in  a  deportation  case
    where the Zambrano principle was engaged it was necessary  to  consider
    whether any interference with rights  derived  from  Art  20  TFEU  was
    proportionate.  At [32], the Tribunal said this:

         "We would conclude (subject to any further guidance from  the  CJEU
         or the Court of Appeal) that any right of residence for the  parent
         is not an absolute one but is subject the Community  law  principle
         of proportionality.   We  doubt  whether  there  is  a  substantial
         difference  between  the   human   rights   based   assessment   of
         proportionality of any interference considered by Lady Hale  in  ZH
         (Tanzania) and the approach required by Community law."

27. In Harrison, the Court of  Appeal  did  not  address  the  question  of
    whether, if the  Zambrano  principle  was  applicable,  Art  7  of  the
    European Charter on Fundamental Rights was engaged and an assessment of
    proportionality had to be made.  However, the Court of Appeal  cast  no
    doubt on the view expressed in Omotunde and,  in  my  judgment,  it  is
    necessary for me to determine whether any interference with the Art  20
    TFEU rights was proportionate.  As the Tribunal indicated in  Omotunde,
    I approach that issue in the same way as, and for convenience  as  part
    of, an assessment of Art 8.

28. Turning then to Art 8, I apply the five-stage approach set out by  Lord
    Bingham in R (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 28.  First,  is  there  family
    life enjoyed between the appellant and his son BK?  There is  no  doubt
    that the appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  his
    son BK who is now 7 years of age.  Until his imprisonment  in  December
    2012, the appellant was the primary carer of BK.  BK's mother  and  the
    appellant separated in 2009 and she moved to  North  Africa  where  she
    resides with her husband and new baby.  I  accept  that  the  appellant
    remains the primary carer of BK although BK is currently  looked  after
    by  his  maternal  grandmother,  a  situation   necessitated   by   the
    appellant's imprisonment and continued,  for  the  present,  out  of  a
    concern to not harm BK's interests if the appellant is deported.  I  am
    satisfied that family life exists between the appellant and BK.

29.  Secondly,  would  the  appellant's  deportation  interfere  with   the
    enjoyment of his family life with BK?   If the appellant were deported,
    BK would lose his primary carer and only parent who has any  continuing
    involvement in his life.  BK is a  British  citizen  and  has  a  right
    derived from the TFEU to remain within the European  Union.   It  would
    not be reasonable to require BK to return with the appellant  to  Iraq.
    Any continuing contact between BK and the appellant would,  thereafter,
    only be by way of telephone, email contact  or  through  the  internet.
    Those methods of communication would not, in my judgment, be  any  real
    substitute for the presence of the appellant to  act  as  BK's  primary
    carer.  Consequently, the appellant's deportation would interfere  with
    the family life enjoyed between the appellant and BK such as to  engage
    Art 8.1.

30. Thirdly, would any such interference be in  accordance  with  the  law?
    Subject to the appellant's deportation breaching Art 8, his deportation
    would be in accordance with the law, namely s.32 of the UK Borders  Act
    2007.

31. Fourthly, would any such interference be in  pursuit  of  a  legitimate
    aim?  The answer is 'yes' because the appellant's deportation would  be
    for the legitimate aim of the prevention of disorder or crime.

32. Fifthly, would the appellant's deportation be necessary in the sense of
    proportionate carrying out a fair balance between the right to  respect
    for the family life of the appellant and BK and the legitimate  aim  of
    the prevention of disorder or crime?  In  carrying  out  the  balancing
    exercise, I bear in mind the factors set out by the Strasbourg Court in
    �ner v Netherlands [2007] Imm AR 303 at [57] and [58].  I further  bear
    in mind the public interest represented by  the  appellant's  offending
    and the three facets of that,  namely  the  risk  of  reoffending,  the
    importance of  deterring  foreign  nationals  from  committing  serious
    crimes and the role  of  deportation  as  an  expression  of  society's
    revulsion at serious crimes (see OH (Serbia) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 694
    at [15]) which retain their force in automatic deportation  cases  (see
    RU (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 651 and AM v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 1634).  The public interest engaged in automatic deportation  cases
    is an important and pressing  factor  in  carrying  out  the  balancing
    exercise required in assessing proportionality such that a "very strong
    claim" is required to outweigh it (see SS (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 550 at [54] per Laws LJ)..

33. As regards the seriousness of the  offence,  Mr  Hibbs'  reliance  upon
    Omotunde as a factually similar case is perhaps surprising  given  that
    the Upper Tribunal found a breach of Art 8 in Omotunde in a case  where
    the fraudulent offending was probably more serious than in this appeal:
    the sentence was one of 2� years  imprisonment.   Here,  the  appellant
    pleaded guilty to a number of serious offences  involving  fraud.   The
    sentence was, in total, one of 12 months imprisonment.  He has no other
    convictions.  The pre-sentence report records that his risk of  further
    offending is "low".  Whilst this offence was  undoubtedly  serious,  it
    did not fall into the category of offence involving serious intentional
    violence or sexual misconduct, or of importing or of dealing in class A
    drugs or trafficking people where deportation as  a  measure  to  deter
    others may have particular importance.

34. The appellant has been in the United Kingdom since February  2004.   He
    has, as a consequence, been in the UK some nine years and eight months.
     The appellant has never had leave to enter or  remain.   There  is  no
    suggestion that, since his release on licence earlier  this  year,  the
    appellant has committed any further offences.

35. Turning to the family circumstances of the appellant.  As I have  noted
    above, the appellant was the primary carer of  his  son  BK  until  his
    imprisonment in December 2012.  That had arisen because  following  the
    separation of the appellant from his wife (BK's mother) in  2009,  BK's
    mother moved to North Africa where she lives with her new  husband  and
    baby.  During the  appellant's  imprisonment,  out  of  necessity  BK's
    maternal grandmother looked after BK.  She continues to  do  so  whilst
    the appellant's deportation issue is  resolved.   The  appellant  lives
    close to BK and the report  of  Angeline  Seymour,  Independent  Social
    Worker to which I have referred above, establishes the closeness of the
    appellant's relationship with BK together with the positive effect  the
    appellant has upon BK and the detrimental effect there is likely to  be
    if the appellant and BK are separated.  Given BK is a  British  citizen
    and, therefore, an EU national, it is not reasonable to  expect  BK  to
    move to Iraq to live with the appellant (see Sanade and Others (British
    children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT  00048  (IAC)).   As  I  have
    indicated above, having regard to the report  of  Angeline  Seymour,  I
    have concluded that it  is  in  the  best  interests  of  BK  that  the
    appellant  should  live  with  him  as  his   parent.    In   assessing
    proportionality, the "best interests" of BK are a primary consideration
    (see ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4).  As Baroness  Hale  explained
    in ZH that does not mean that those interests must necessarily prevail.
     At [26] she said this:

             "This did not mean (as it would do  in  other  contexts)  that
             identifying their best interests would lead  inexorably  to  a
             decision in conformity with those interests. Provided that the
             Tribunal did not treat any other consideration  as  inherently
             more significant than the best interests of the  children,  it
             could conclude that the strength of the  other  considerations
             outweighed  them.  The  important  thing,  therefore,  is   to
             consider those best interests first."

    (See further HH v Deputy Prosecutor for  the  Italian  Republic  [2012]
    UKSC 25, especially at [9]-[15] per Baroness Hale.)

36. As I have already indicated, in practical terms BK  is  dependent  upon
    the appellant for the exercise of his EU right of residence and that to
    deport the appellant will deprive BK of the effective exercise of  that
    right of residence.  These are very powerful factors  weighing  in  the
    proportionality assessment  against  the  public  interest.   Whilst  I
    accept that the appellant has, himself, spent the majority of his  life
    in Iraq and, disregarding the interests of BK, it could not be said  to
    be unreasonable to expect him to live in Iraq.

37. Carrying out the balancing exercise,  and  giving  due  weight  to  the
    public interest represented by the appellant's offending,  taking  into
    account the "best interests" of BK as a primary consideration and  that
    the deportation of the appellant will effectively end the  family  life
    between BK and his father, in all the circumstances I do  not  consider
    that the interference with the appellant's family life is justified  by
    the public interest in this case.  Deportation of the  appellant  would
    not be a proportionate means of giving effect to the legitimate aim  of
    the prevention of disorder and crime.

38. In reaching my decision, I note that the First-tier Tribunal found that
    the appellant could not satisfy the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules in paras 398 and 399.  In particular, at para  116  the  Tribunal
    stated  that  it  was  not  established  that  there  are  "exceptional
    circumstances" that outweigh the public interest applying para  398(c).
    That finding is not formally challenged in this appeal.   However,  the
    issue of "exceptional circumstances" is in essence the issue of whether
    the appellant can establish a breach of Art 8 (see MF (Nigeria) v  SSHD
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192).  I also note that the Tribunal finding  in  para
    116 is essentially unreasoned unless  it  relies  upon  the  Tribunal's
    earlier assessment under Art 8 of the relevant factors  in  reaching  a
    finding (set aside by UTJ Storey in this appeal) that  the  appellant's
    deportation would be proportionate.  In reaching that  assessment,  for
    the reasons I have given, I come to a different conclusion to  that  of
    the First-tier Tribunal, particularly in  the  light  of  the  Zambrano
    principle and BK's best interests clearly demonstrated in the report of
    Angeline Seymour which was not before the First-tier Tribunal  when  it
    reached its decision.

39. Consequently, I am satisfied that  the  appellant's  deportation  would
    breach Art 8 and also, on the basis of the Zambrano principle, would be
    a breach of the appellant's and BK's rights under EU law.

Decision

40. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law in dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art  8  and  EU  law.
    That decision is  set  aside.   I  remake  the  decision  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8 and EU law.

41. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal on
    asylum and humanitarian protection grounds and  under  the  Immigration
    Rules stands.
