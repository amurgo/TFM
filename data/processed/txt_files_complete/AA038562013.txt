                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Harrington, instructed by Gloucester Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Although the matter is not entirely  free  from  doubt,  we  treat  the
    appellant as Herve Patrice Loko, a national of the Ivory Coast born  on
    8 September 1967.   He claims that he has a fear of persecution in  the
    Ivory Coast.  That fear arises from his  membership  of  the  Adjoukrou
    ethnic group and his political activity and opinions.

 2. The appellant says that although he has family in Abidjan, the  capital
    of Ivory Coast, he is from Sassandra, a town in the south, where he was
    from 1998 onwards working as  a  school  science  teacher.   He  was  a
    supporter of the then president Laurent Gbagbo and the local section of
    the  Ivorian  Popular  Front.   He  had  a  secretarial  role  in   the
    organisation of the party, and took part in local activities  promoting
    democracy and the struggle for  the  rule  of  law.   As  part  of  the
    difficulties his  country  suffered  at  that  period,  a  neighbouring
    village was taken over by people from the north  of  the  country,  who
    were politically opposed  to  the  Gbagbo.   They  threatened  physical
    violence in order to silence the party's message,  but  the  appellant,
    amongst others, refused to be silenced.  He took the view that  he  was
    at risk of physical harm, which risk he thought would be all  the  more
    real because of his ethnicity: he therefore made arrangements to  leave
    the country.  Although the difficulties had begun in January 2004,  his
    arrival in the United Kingdom was, he says, on 5 September 2004.

 3. Having taken the trouble to travel to the United Kingdom,  he  did  not
    claim asylum.  He now says, however,  that  the  president  elected  in
    2010, Alassane Ouattara, is taking revenge against  the  supporters  of
    Gbagbo, and that again his ethnicity will put him at risk of  suffering
    from that policy, because southerners like himself are assumed to  have
    supported Gbagbo.

 4. The appellant's asylum claim was rejected by the  Secretary  of  State,
    who on 7 April 2013 gave notice of a decision to remove  the  appellant
    as an illegal entrant.  The appellant appealed, and in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge B Lloyd dismissed his appeal in a determination sent out
    on 13 May 2013.  The appellant now has permission  to  appeal  to  this
    Tribunal.


 5. It is the appellant's task to establish his claim,  and  his  principal
    difficulty in showing that he is telling the truth about the events  he
    has  described  is  his  immigration  history.   As  we  have   already
    indicated, he did not claim asylum on his arrival in 2004.   That  much
    is clear, and it is also clear that he was found in the United Kingdom,
    working illegally, in 2013 and it was then  that  he  made  his  asylum
    claim.  The Secretary of State's summary of  what  the  appellant  said
    about his history when he was arrested is as follows:

          "When you were arrested  in  March  2013  you  claimed  that  you:
          arrived in Germany 1986, married a German  wife  in  1987,  Elaima
          KARMEN 17/05/68 (married for 7 years), live in Germany  1987-2005,
          obtained German passport  in  2001  (now  expired),  obtained  new
          passport in 2011 from a police station in Hamburg, came to  UK  in
          2005 with German passport,  resided  at  11  Luhmenstrasse,  9371,
          Hamburg, Germany, you now [have]  a  second  wife  (Yvonne  KOUAME
          11/03/71 from Ivory Coast) who  lives  at  the  above  address  in
          Hamburg and she is pregnant.  You further admitted to  working  at
          BPI Recycled Products in Stroud, Gloucestershire.  A scanned  copy
          of your EEA German identity card was  eventually  found  and  [on]
          examination by a competent forgery  officer  was  found  to  be  a
          forgery.  You subsequently admitted your real  identity  and  that
          you were not in fact a German national."


 6. That is not the end of the matter, however,  because,  as  the  refusal
    letter also indicates, the Secretary of  State  has  a  record  of  his
    application for a visit visa, made in Germany in  1998,  in  his  false
    German identity; and further applications, not using his  false  German
    passport but in his present claimed identity, in 2004 for a visit visa,
    which was granted; later in 2004, whilst in the UK, for a student visa,
    which was refused; and, on 27 June 2005, again for a student visa,  but
    this time the application was made from Accra.  The Secretary of  State
    has produced the application form relating to that application.  It  is
    clearly made in the appellant's present claimed identity.   It  asserts
    that he proposes to undertake a course at the Green Valley  College  in
    North London.  It says that he will travel on an Ivory  Coast  passport
    issued in the Ivory Coast in August 2001, and it gives his  address  as
    the Lyceï¿½ in Sassandra, with a telephone number.

 7. The Secretary of State has  taken  the  view  that  the  appellant  was
    probably in Germany at the time he claims to have witnessed the  events
    in the Ivory Coast which form the basis of his claim.  Before the First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge,  however,  the   appellant   produced   material
    suggesting that he might indeed have been in the  Ivory  Coast  at  the
    relevant time.  It does not appear that the  appellant  has  ever  been
    able to cast any doubt on the  Secretary  of  State's  records  of  his
    application for a visa from Accra in 2005, indicating that he was  then
    in Ivory Coast.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge took the  view  that  the  appellant  was
    wholly lacking in credibility.  He regarded the appellant's  claim  as,
    as he put it:

            "a hastily put together and last minute attempt to  secure  his
           further residence in the UK. ... He has relied on  a  carelessly
           constructed narrative of events which advances the case that  he
           will be persecuted for isolated events which he says happened as
           long ago as January 2004.  He claimed  also  to  be  the  victim
           historically  and  prospectively  of  ethnicity   discrimination
           because of his Adjoukrou origins.  His account of  being  unable
           to make an asylum claim in the UK because he  did  not  know  or
           understand how to go about it is in my  considered  view  sorely
           lacking in credibility.  This is a man who has had the ingenuity
           of mind to construct  a  web  of  deceit  with  a  view  to  his
           continuing and illegal residence in this country.  He is  by  no
           means an intelligent man.  Indeed if he is to be believed at all
           about his background he has worked as a teacher of  physics  and
           chemistry.  The notion that he declined to make  the  claim  for
           asylum because of guidance given to him by members  of  the  ex-
           patriot Ivory Coast community in the UK is quite unbelievable.


           If he was reticent to make a claim for asylum it was because  he
           knew the overwhelming likelihood of his being exposed as a  sham
           asylum claimant. ... His account to this Tribunal is a falsity."

 9. In these circumstances the judge did not make  any  full  investigation
    into whether the events narrated by the claimant had in fact  happened,
    or whether the claimant was at any risk arising from his  ethnicity  or
    perceived political opinion.  It is for that reason that he  now  seeks
    permission to appeal against the determination:  the  grounds,  and  Ms
    Harrington's submissions, assert that  the  judge  was  bound  to  make
    findings as to the risk to the appellant, in particular  that  deriving
    from his ethnicity.

10. We agree with Mr Richards' submission that this is one of  the  unusual
    cases where the judge's disbelief of the appellant was so profound that
    hardly anything else needed to be said.  Whether or not  the  appellant
    was in Germany in 2002 to 2004, he appears to have been in Africa,  and
    contactable at Sassandra, in 2005, which  is  after  the  date  he  now
    claims to have  entered  the  United  Kingdom  with  a  fear  of  being
    persecuted in the Ivory Coast.  Although of course he is  not  required
    to produce any corroboration for his claim, the  position  is  that  it
    does depend entirely on his word, and at every point where his word can
    be tested it has been found that he is not telling the truth.  There is
    simply no basis for any assumption that he might be telling  the  truth
    about his history or activities in the Ivory Coast at any time.

11. In any event, there is no evidence that any incidents in  Sassandra  in
    2004, or any  political  activities  in  2004,  would  now  expose  the
    appellant to risk.  There is no evidence that he is well-known or  that
    his activities were such, or are thought to have been such, as  to  put
    him at risk of the revenge attacks which he claims have been  happening
    since 2010.  So  far  as  concerns  his  ethnicity,  as  Ms  Harrington
    accepted, there is no objective evidence of this ethnic group being  in
    difficulty.   The  UNHCR's  guidance  emphasises  the  need  for  facts
    specific assessment of claims made on this basis, and  the  reports  of
    such difficulties are vague in the extreme.  In any event, there  seems
    to be no reason why the appellant should not relocate to  another  part
    of the Ivory Coast, if he thinks that he is at risk in Sassandra.

12. As we have said, we think that this genuinely is a case where the whole
    of the appellant's claim falls away because he is  wholly  unbelievable
    about his history.  But, even if there were some truth in the claim  he
    has made, the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge and  before
    us falls far short of establishing that the claimant would  be  at  any
    risk in the Ivory Coast at the present time.

13. We therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal.


Anonymity

An anonymity order was made in the First-tier  Tribunal.   Such  orders  are
routinely and properly made in asylum cases pending the determination of  an
appeal.  In the present case there are no children involved.  The result  of
the determination of the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal is  that
the detailed facts claimed by  the  claimant  are  not  shown  to  have  any
relation to the claimant's actual history.  The claimant  has  no  right  to
protection from public knowledge of his lies  to  the  authorities  and  the
Tribunal.  We therefore discharge the order granting him anonymity.
