For the Appellant:     Mr Shea, Counsel instructed by Whitefield Solicitors
Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants in this linked appeal are a wife and  husband,  in  what
    purports to be a genuine and subsisting marriage such that the  'family
    member'  provisions  of  the  Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2016 ('the Regulations') would be engaged.  The  Respondent
    regards their marriage to be one of 'convenience',  contrived  for  the
    purpose of circumventing immigration control. This was  the  matter  in
    issue before the First-tier Tribunal.

    Background and First-tier Tribunal Decision

 2. The first Appellant is a national of Italy, born on the 25th June 1987.
     Her  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  brought  against  the
    Respondent's decision of the 17th January 2019 to remove her under  the
    powers contained in section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act  1999,
    those powers being exercised pursuant to Regulations 23, 26 and  32  of
    the Regulations on the grounds that she is deemed to have 'misused  the
    right to residence in the United Kingdom'  by  having  entered  into  a
    marriage of convenience.

 3. The second Appellant is a  national  of  Pakistan,  born  on  the  22nd
    January 1988. His appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was brought against
    the Respondent's decision of the 15th February 2019 to refuse to  grant
    him a residence card as a family member.

 4. It was the evidence of the Appellants that they had met in  2017  at  a
    wedding in the United Kingdom. They had exchanged contact  details  and
    stayed in touch. They underwent an Islamic ceremony on the  27th  April
    2018 in front of close family and friends and the following day held  a
    reception in a restaurant with 75 guests.  They state  that  from  that
    date on they have lived together at the same  address  in  Bury;  their
    time together has only been interrupted by the first Appellant's visits
    back to Italy to receive medical treatment for  Lupus.   Subsequent  to
    their nikah they sought  permission  from  the  Home  Office  to  marry
    according to English law which was granted. They were married  at  Bury
    Registry Office on the 5th January 2019.  They then made an application
    under the  Regulations  for  the  second  Appellant  to  be  granted  a
    residence card.

 5. On the morning of the 17th January 2019 the  two  were  awoken  by  the
    noise of eight immigration officers demanding entry to their  property.
    The officers were admitted. The Appellants were separated and  asked  a
    series of questions, with no interpreter present. The  first  Appellant
    states that she informed officers that she was unwell and that she  was
    in no fit state to be interviewed. The interview proceeded but  neither
    Appellants had their answers checked or read back to them.  The  second
    Appellant was taken into custody (he was back at  home  within  a  week
    after a Judge granted bail).

 6. The Respondent does not dispute  that  the  interviews  took  place  at
    6.30am, or that no interpreters were present. It  is  however  strongly
    denied that the first Appellant claimed  to  be  ill,  or  that  either
    Appellant was disorientated and unable to clearly answer questions.  As
    to  the  Appellants'  respective  abilities  to  speak   English,   the
    Respondent points out that Mr Aslam was admitted to this country  as  a
    student, and that Ms Tofique has been working in a shop for  some  time
    so could be expected to have a basic  understanding  of  the  language.
    Reliance is placed on the transcripts of the interviews conducted  that
    morning.  The  Respondent   submits   that   the   transcripts   reveal
    discrepancies and admissions on the part of the  Appellants  such  that
    the Respondent could reasonably  form  a  suspicion  that  this  was  a
    marriage of convenience.

 7. This was the competing evidence submitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Both  Appellants,  and  their  supporting  witnesses,  then  gave  oral
    evidence. Having heard that evidence the Tribunal determined that  this
    was indeed a marriage of convenience, contracted with the connivance of
    both parties. In reaching that finding the  Tribunal  gave  significant
    weight to the interview transcripts  but  found  there  to  be  further
    discrepancies arising in the testimony of the  parties  at  court.  The
    appeals were thereby dismissed.

    The Grounds of Appeal

 8. The Appellants submit that in  reaching  its  decision  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in approach in the following material respects:

      i) Perversity

             Mr Shea submitted that on any rational reading of the evidence
             the finding that this was a marriage of convenience was simply
             not  one  open  to  the  Tribunal.  He  submitted   that   the
             deficiencies in  the  Respondent's  case  were  such  that  no
             properly directed Tribunal could find the Rosa burden of proof
             to be discharged.

     ii) In failing to take material matters into account:

             The Appellants were woken at 6.30am by  immigration  officials
             who entered their home and questioned them.  It  is  submitted
             that in its consideration of the  transcripts  the  First-tier
             Tribunal erred in failing to have  regard  to  the  manner  in
             which the 'interview' was conducted viz. early in the morning,
             when the Appellants were in a state of shock, in  the  absence
             of any interpreter or legal  advisor.  It  is  submitted  that
             these  matters  were   plainly   relevant   to   the   alleged
             discrepancies arising in the evidence given  and  should  have
             been given due weight.   It  is  further  submitted  that  the
             Tribunal erred in failing to place any weight on the fact that
             both Appellants were asleep in the same  house  at  6.30am,  a
             matter giving rise to a strong inference that they are  living
             together as husband and wife.

    iii) Unfairness in refusing to admit relevant evidence:

             The First-tier Tribunal records [at its �4] that it refused to
             admit a  evidence  of  'whatsapp'  communication  between  the
             Appellants because some of  it  was  conducted  in  Urdu,  and
             translations had not been provided. The Tribunal  goes  on  to
             weigh against  the  Appellants  the  fact  that  there  is  no
             evidence of communication such as 'whatsapp' messages.  It  is
             submitted that in the circumstances that the Tribunal  plainly
             considered  the  material  to  be  directly  relevant  to  its
             decision, the material should in fairness have  been  admitted
             and/or the final hearing adjourned to permit  translations  to
             be prepared.

    Discussion and Findings

 9. I deal first with the allegation of perversity. Before me Mr Shea began
    his  submissions  by  stating  that  this   error   occurred   in   the
    determination of whether the  Respondent  had  discharged  the  overall
    legal  burden  to  demonstrate  that  this  marriage  was  a  sham;  he
    subsequently developed his grounds to submit that it had been  perverse
    for the Tribunal to have embarked on its enquiry in  the  first  place,
    since the Secretary of State had manifestly  failed  to  discharge  the
    evidential burden of showing sufficient  cause  to  suspect  that  this
    marriage may not be genuine.  I take each of these issues in turn.

10. The effect of the decisions in ECO Nicosia v Papajorgi  (EEA  spouse  -
    marriage of  convenience)  Greece  [2012]  UKUT  00038  (IAC),  Agho  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1198  and
    Rosa v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 14 is
    as follows.   There is no burden  on  a  claimant  to  prove  that  his
    marriage is genuine. Where however the decision  maker  has  reasonable
    grounds for suspecting that to be the case, such grounds must be put to
    the claimant to give him an opportunity to dispel  the  suspicions.  In
    the final analysis the legal burden of proof lies upon the Secretary of
    State.

11. Did the Secretary of State in this  case  have  reasonable  grounds  to
    suspect that the marriage was not genuine?  The  Secretary  of  State's
    case rests  on  the  matters  identified  in  the  transcripts  of  the
    interviews, summarised in the refusal letter of the 15th February  2019
    as:

          i) Mr Aslam is said to have admitted that this was a marriage  of
             convenience;

         ii) Mr Aslam was unable to give the date of his wedding;

        iii) That the Appellants were found  to  be  sleeping  in  separate
             rooms at the property.

12. Mr Shea protests that the deficiencies in  the  transcripts  themselves
    demonstrate that this evidence could not, and  should  not,  have  been
    relied upon. They are a typed version of a handwritten  note  which  is
    not supplied; they confirm that no interpreter was present and that  it
    was early in the morning. He submits that some of the answers  recorded
    are highly unlikely to be the answers that the Appellants in fact gave,
    and that if they did give them it is highly likely  that  they  did  so
    misunderstanding what they were being asked.

13. The Respondent's case before the Tribunal was not particularly  cogent.
    As I set out above, three reasons are given in the refusal letter.  The
    first is wrong as a matter of fact. Nowhere in the interview transcript
    can Mr Aslam be seen admitting that this is a marriage of  convenience.
    It seems likely that the author of the refusal letter had in mind  this
    exchange that appears in Ms Tofique's transcript [for  clarity  I  have
    identified the Q&As, missing from original]:

         Q  Have you been paid to marry him?

         A  Yes. - changed to say she paid for the ceremony -  not  paid  to
         marry him




         Q  How much?

         A  �143 [this being the figure she had earlier given as the fees of
         the registry office]

    As to Mr Aslam's failure to give a date for the  wedding  ceremony,  it
    must be noted that his response "at Bury Council 3.45" should  be  read
    in the context that the ceremony had happened only days  before.  Since
    it is not contested that the ceremony did in fact  take  place,  it  is
    difficult to see how his failure to give the date, on the  spot,  first
    thing in the morning, is a factor of very  much  weight  at  all.  That
    leaves the fact that Mr Aslam was found to be sleeping on the sofa when
    the officers arrived: hardly damning in itself. For  those  reasons,  I
    agree that the refusal letter, in the terms in  which  it  was  framed,
    arguably fails to attain  even  the  low  threshold  required  for  the
    Respondent to discharge  that  initial  evidential  burden  of  finding
    'reasonable grounds to suspect' that this is a marriage of convenience.

14. That said, I am not prepared to find that Judge McAll acted  perversely
    when he decided to proceed with the hearing.

15. First, because there is nothing at all to suggest that the  submissions
    now made by Mr Shea were made by Mr Khan, the solicitor who represented
    the Appellants on the day.  On  the  contrary  the  Appellants  tacitly
    accepted that the Respondent had shown reasonable grounds,  since  they
    came to court prepared to offer their rebuttal  evidence.  They  at  no
    time took the position that they had no case to answer.  Nor  is  there
    any indication that they sought to have the transcripts  excluded  from
    the evidence.

16. Second, because the refusal  letter  was  not  the  sum  total  of  the
    Respondent's case.  The case rested on the actual transcripts, in which
    Mr Aslam was apparently unable to say very much at all about  his  wife
    beyond the fact that she likes fish and cars,  the  two  gave  markedly
    discrepant answers about where they went on their first  date,  and  Ms
    Tofique is recorded as having said the following:

         Q  Why marry someone you know nothing about?

         A  I have nothing to hide




         Q  So you nothing about him, do you not think it's  a  bit  suspect
         that someone you hardly know proposes after a few dates then?

         A  Bit suspect - yes.




         Q  We have seen messages to show he does not live here  permanently
         with you, is this correct?

         A  Yes




         Q  How often do you see each other?

         A  Every month

17. Even if  the  Appellants  could,  in  the  final  analysis,  show  this
    admission that the  couple  live  separately  to  have  arisen  from  a
    misunderstanding/extenuating circumstances, I  am  satisfied  that  the
    interviews themselves were a sufficient  basis  for  the  Secretary  of
    State to have taken the action that she  has.   It  was  therefore  not
    perverse for Judge McAll to have proceeded  to  hear  evidence  in  the
    appeals.

18. That brings me to his overall decision. The determination is  long  and
    detailed and numerous discrepancies  in  the  Appellants'  evidence  is
    identified, but the crux of the reasoning is  found  at  paragraph  49.
    Having directed himself to the jurisprudence on fairness and  interview
    records Judge McAll says this:

         "Whilst the interviews in this case do  not  relate  to  an  asylum
         claim the guidance is a useful reminder on the need to ensure  that
         the interview process must be fair and the record  as  accurate  as
         possible. I  have  carefully  considered  the  interviews  and  the
         statements and oral evidence of the appellants and their witnesses.
         Had the interview records thrown up a  handful  of  inconsistencies
         that the appellants had addressed in the oral evidence then I would
         have added less weight to the interviews  regardless  of  the  fact
         that I do find both appellants have an adequate enough  command  of
         the English language to have understood  the  questions  being  put
         with the exception of ST's understanding of the word  'subsisting'.
         However their appeal statements and oral evidence have  revealed  a
         complete lack of knowledge of  each  other.  They  have  both  been
         inconsistent with each other and their witnesses regarding what was
         known about UA's immigration status and when that  information  was
         shared with them, they have given conflicting descriptions of  ST's
         medical issues from June 2018 through to January  2019.  They  have
         given conflicting evidence as to who ST travelled to Italy with  to
         receive treatment, who she stayed with whilst she  was  there,  how
         long she stayed there and I find it totally incredible for a couple
         claiming to be newly-weds. To marry  in  April  2010  and  on  ST's
         account to be separated from June to August 2018 is something  that
         should have stood out in UA's evidence but he described living with
         ST from April 2018 and seeing her "on a daily basis" and only  when
         ST's visits Italy were put to him did he mention them  and  gave  a
         totally inaccurate account of them. They could not have been living
         together in a genuine relationship at that time  because  he  would
         have known far more about ST than he has been able to describe".

19. Although Mr Shea made detailed submissions on how the judge could  have
    found  otherwise,  his  case  fell  fall  short  of  establishing  this
    reasoning to be perverse. As  this  passage  illustrates,  the  hearing
    revealed a number of significant discrepancies from which  Judge  McAll
    drew negative inference: I am satisfied that he was rationally entitled
    to do so.  That there were  more  than  one  explanation  for  all  the
    matters arising did not preclude Judge McAll from taking a view; indeed
    that is what he was there to do.

20. I now turn to the remaining grounds.

21. There was no arguable unfairness in the Judge refusing to admit, on the
    morning of the hearing, 'whatsapp' messages  exhibited  on  Mr  Aslam's
    mobile telephone. It was wholly inappropriate of Mr Khan,  representing
    the Appellants, to suggest this. Admitting the evidence at  that  stage
    would have deprived the Home Office presenting officer of a  reasonable
    opportunity to consider it; many of the messages were untranslated from
    the Urdu; it was not in compliance with directions.  Having  made  that
    perfectly legitimate decision to exclude the evidence the Judge  cannot
    be criticised for failing to take it  into  account.  On  the  evidence
    before him there was a lack of evidence of 'intervening devotion'.   Mr
    Shea accepted  that  Mr  Khan  had  not  made  an  application  for  an
    adjournment, but suggested that fairness  required  that  the  Tribunal
    adjourn of its own motion so that  the  'whatsapp'  messages  could  be
    evidenced in proper form. I reject that submission. The refusal  letter
    was served on the Appellants in February. The hearing was in June. They
    therefore had plenty of time to prepare their case, knowing  full  well
    what the evidence against them was.

22. I am not satisfied that the Tribunal failed to take  into  account  the
    circumstances surrounding the interviews.    Judge  McAll  was  plainly
    aware of the manner in which the 'raid' took place on the property, and
    the fact that no interpreters were present: he expressly addresses that
    matter in the passage I have cited above [at his �49].   In any  event,
    it is clear from his decision that the interviews played only  a  small
    part in his final decision, which was primarily based on  the  evidence
    that was given at hearing, some five months after  the  shock  of  that
    visit had receded, and with the Appellants having had  the  benefit  of
    legal advice.

23. Accordingly I reject the grounds of appeal and find no error of law.

    Decisions

24. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material error
    of law and it is upheld.

25. I was not asked to make an order for anonymity and on the facts  I  see
    no reason to do so.
