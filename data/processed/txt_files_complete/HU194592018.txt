Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. M. Azmi, Counsel, instructed by Wright Justice
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. C. Bates, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against a decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge I. F. Taylor, promulgated on 26 June 2019, in which he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to
    refuse a grant of leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

    "It is arguable that in focussing on the medication the judge failed to
    properly address the question of the relationships developed with the
    mental health team and the consequences of separation on the wife's
    mental health.  It is also arguable that in the assessment of
    proportionality the judge failed to properly consider the decision in
    Chikwamba [2008] 1 WLR 1420 - see ground 5.

    It is arguable that in failing to properly consider the evidence of the
    appellant's wife's mental health and the circumstances surrounding the
    rape and the fact that the family had been placed in the witness
    protection programme because of the wife giving evidence in a murder
    case, the judge has failed to assess all of the relevant evidence.  His
    failure to do so has led to an arguable error of law being made."

The hearing

 3. The Appellant and his wife attended the hearing.

 4. At the outset Mr. Bates conceded on behalf of the Respondent that the
    decision involved the making of material errors of law with reference
    both to the failure of the Judge to consider the effect on the
    Appellant's wife, and also with relation to Chikwamba, as the Appellant
    would have been exempt from the financial requirements, given that his
    wife is in receipt of DLA.

 5. In the circumstances, I set the decision aside to be remade.  I heard
    further evidence from the Appellant's wife following which I allowed
    the Appellant's appeal.  My full decision and reasons are set out
    below.

Error of Law

 6. I find that the grounds of appeal are made out.  At [17] the Judge
    states:

"In paragraph 2, the appellant states that his partner has established
relationships with her medical care providers and she would not be able to
cope with all the changes specifically surrounding her medical care.  She
is entitled to free medical care in the United Kingdom which would not be
available in Bangladesh.  The appellant says that it would be unduly harsh
for his partner to be deprived of the level of care and treatment provided.
 I am satisfied that the medication that the appellant's partner is
prescribed is available in Bangladesh and is affordable."

 7. The Judge goes on to state that he accepts "that it is reasonable to
    suppose that the medical treatment and care in Bangladesh may be
    inferior to that provided in the United Kingdom.  However,
    discrepancies of this nature are not sufficient to amount to
    "insurmountable obstacles".

 8. There is no consideration of the evidence of the Appellant and his wife
    as to the strength and importance of the established relationships
    which the Appellant's wife has with her medical care providers.  There
    is no consideration of her evidence that she would not be able to cope
    with the changes, specifically surrounding her medical care.  There was
    evidence before the Judge that the Appellant's wife struggled with
    change.  I was referred to pages 56 and 57 of the supplementary bundle
    where there is evidence that the proposed eviction of the Appellant's
    wife from her accommodation caused a worsening of her depressive
    illness.  The Judge has made no reference to the evidence of the
    Appellant's wife's inability to cope with change.

 9. At [23] the Judge accepts the "summation of the appellant's partner's
    life which.....is truly horrendous".  Despite this, he has not
    considered the effect of the changes in the provision of her medical
    care given the nature of the traumas which she has endured.  The
    Appellant's wife's ability to cope with change and relocate to
    Bangladesh is a key issue when deciding whether or not paragraph
    EX.1(b) is met.  I find that the error fully to consider the
    Appellant's wife's circumstances is a material error of law.

10. In relation to Chikwamba, and the extent to which this should have been
    considered in the proportionality balancing exercise, there is no
    consideration of whether or not temporary separation would be a
    disproportionate interference.  There is no consideration of the extent
    to which the Appellant would meet the requirements of the immigration
    rules.  As accepted by Mr. Bates, the Appellant would be exempt from
    the financial requirements as his wife is in receipt of DLA.  There was
    no evidence to suggest that the accommodation was not suitable and, at
    the time, the Appellant had a valid English language test certificate.
    I find that the failure to consider the effect of temporary separation
    on the Appellant's wife given the above is a material error of law.

11. I therefore set the decision aside to be remade.

Remaking

12. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant's wife.  Both representatives
    made oral submissions.

13. I have taken into account the documents contained in the Appellant's
    main bundle (204 pages), his additional bundle (22 pages), his
    supplementary bundle (58 pages), the Respondent's bundle (73 pages),
    the skeleton argument and the letter from the Appellant's wife's doctor
    dated 3 May 2019.

14. The burden of proof lies on the Appellant to show that the Respondent's
    decision is a breach of his rights, and/or those  of  his  wife,  to  a
    family and private life under Article 8 ECHR.  The standard of proof is
    the balance of probabilities.

15. As agreed at the hearing, the issue before me is whether or not the
    Appellant meets the requirements of paragraph EX.1(b) of the
    immigration rules.  In order to meet this paragraph the Appellant must
    show that there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with his
    wife continuing outside of the United Kingdom.  Paragraph EX.2 states:

"For the purposes of paragraph EX.1(b) insurmountable obstacles means the
very significant difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or
their partner in continuing their family life together outside the UK and
which could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the
applicant or their partner."

16. I find that the Appellant meets the requirements of paragraph EX.1(b).
    I find that his wife would face very significant difficulties which
    could not be overcome, and which would entail very serious hardship for
    her.

17. I found the Appellant's wife to be an honest and credible witness.  As
    acknowledged by Mr. Bates, her oral evidence was detailed, consistent
    and candid.  It is not necessary for me to set out here the traumas
    which the Appellant's wife has endured.  This evidence is not disputed,
    and is set out in the witness statements.  As a result of these
    traumas, her mental health is fragile.  She suffers from anxiety,
    depression, PTSD and agoraphobia.  She has panic attacks, and has self-
    harmed.  She also has an eating disorder.  She is prescribed
    medication.  She also requires constant monitoring, both by friends and
    family in the form of the Appellant, her "rock" and her "pillar", and
    also from qualified medical professionals.

18. I find that the Appellant's wife is in need of extensive care and
    support from mental health services.  She gave evidence that there was
    a considerable decline in her mental health following the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal, promulgated in June 2019.  She became suicidal
    and was almost admitted to hospital under the Mental Health Act.  She
    stopped eating and started self-harming again.  The traumas resurfaced
    and became "too much".  As a result, her medication was changed and she
    is now seeing the consultant more regularly.  Additionally she is
    seeing a Community Psychiatric Nurse (the "CPN") twice a month, and is
    receiving two types of counselling, one in relation to sexual violence
    and the other in relation to body dysmorphia.  She said that she was
    very anxious and "very very low" most of the time.

19. The Appellant's wife gave evidence that the new medication and
    counselling were helping.  Her counselling was getting to the "core
    problems".  She gave evidence that the improvement was due to her
    excellent team of medics.  She is able to speak to her doctor straight
    away if she phones on one of her low days.  She described the team as
    brilliant and said that she had a very good rapport with her counsellor
    and her CPN.  She repeatedly described the very good relationship that
    she has with her mental health team, and said that she was very hopeful
    that the team would "get me somewhere".  She thought that the new
    counselling was working, and that her treatment was very good.

20. I find that the Appellant's wife would simply not receive this level of
    care in Bangladesh, and I find that this would cause her very serious
    hardship.  I find that the evidence shows that change causes a
    deterioration in her mental health.  There was evidence of this before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  I find that the effect of the First-tier
    Tribunal decision in June was to cause a significant deterioration in
    the Appellant's wife's mental health, leading to self-harm and the
    prospect of admission to hospital under the Mental Health Act.  I find
    that medication alone is not what keeps the Appellant's wife mental
    health stable.  Her mental health is maintained through the extensive
    support and treatment which she receives from qualified medical
    professionals in the United Kingdom.  It is clear that were she to have
    to accompany the Appellant to Bangladesh in order to continue family
    life, she would not receive this treatment.  The relationships which
    she has developed with her treatment team would be broken immediately.
    Further, she does not speak Bengali, so it would be very difficult for
    her to establish the same level of rapport with mental health staff.  I
    find that the Appellant's wife has never been to Bangladesh and has no
    knowledge of mental health services in Bangladesh.

21. It was accepted in the First-tier Tribunal that the mental health
    services were likely to be inferior in Bangladesh, but that this did
    not amount to insurmountable obstacles.  I find that the Appellant's
    wife would not be able to access mental health services owing to
    language difficulties.  The Appellant would not be a sufficient "go-
    between" given the nature of the relationships which need to be built
    up with healthcare professionals in order for treatment to be
    effective, especially given the horrendous nature of the traumas which
    the Appellant's wife has suffered.   The Appellant's wife gave evidence
    that the only man that she will allow near her is the Appellant, owing
    to the nature of her past traumas.

22. I find that the Appellant's wife would face very serious hardship were
    she to have to move to Bangladesh.  It would result in a significant
    deterioration in her mental health.  It is quite possible that it would
    lead to self-harm or even suicide.  In addition to the significant harm
    caused to her by breaking the established relationships with mental
    health professionals, she would not be able to access the care that she
    needs in Bangladesh given the circumstances outlined above.  I find
    that family life between the Appellant and his wife could not be
    continued in Bangladesh due to these insurmountable obstacles.  I
    therefore find that the Appellant has shown that he meets the
    requirements of paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM of the immigration
    rules.

23. I have considered the Appellant's appeal under Article 8 in accordance
    with the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I find that the Appellant has
    a family life with his wife sufficient to engage the operation of
    Article 8.  I find that the decision would interfere with his family
    life.

24. Continuing the steps set out in Razgar, I find that the proposed
    interference would be in accordance with the law, as being a regular
    immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with the immigration
    rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a fair
    balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of the
    community.  The public interest in this case is the preservation of
    orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all citizens.
    Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently a
    very important public interest.  In practice, this will usually trump
    the qualified rights of the individual, unless the level of
    interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the level
    of interference would be significant and that it would not be
    proportionate.

25. I have taken into account all of my findings above.  In assessing the
    public interest I have taken into account section 19 of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Section 117B(1) provides
    that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
    interest.  I have found above that the Appellant meets the requirements
    of paragraph EX.1(b).  I therefore find that there will be no
    compromise to the maintenance of effective immigration control by
    allowing his appeal.

26. In support of this, TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 states at [34]:-

"That has the benefit that where a person satisfies the Rules, whether or
not by reference to an article 8 informed requirement, then this will be
positively determinative of that person's article 8 appeal, provided their
case engages article 8(1), for the very reason that it would then be
disproportionate for that person to be removed."

27. Further, the headnote to OA and Others (human rights; 'new matter';
    s.120) Pakistan [2019] UKUT 00065 (IAC) states:

"(1) In a human rights appeal under section 82(1)(b) of the Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, a finding that a person (P) satisfies the
requirements of a particular immigration rule, so as to be entitled to
leave to remain, means that (provided Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged),
the Secretary of State will not be able to point to the importance of
maintaining immigration controls as a factor weighing in favour of the
Secretary of State in the proportionality balance, so far as that factor
relates to the particular immigration rule that the judge has found to be
satisfied."

28. The Appellant speaks English (section 117B(2)).  He provided a
    certificate issued in June 2017 showing that he achieved Level A1.  In
    relation to Chikwamba, it was submitted by Mr. Bates with reference to
    Appendix O of the immigration rules that this certificate would not now
    be valid.  Notwithstanding its validity, it is evidence of his English
    language ability.

29. In relation to financial independence (section 117B(3)), it is
    significant that the Appellant would meet the financial requirements
    for entry clearance as a spouse as his wife is in receipt of DLA.  She
    gave evidence that they live in a two bedroomed home, just herself and
    the Appellant, with the occasional visit from her younger daughter.
    The Appellant would therefore also meet the accommodation requirements
    of the immigration rules.

30. In relation to sections 117B(4) and 117B(5), the Appellant had leave
    when he met his wife in June 2016.  He had an extant appeal against a
    previous decision in relation to his Tier 4 visa.  Section 117B(6) is
    not relevant.

31. In relation to Chikwamba, I have found above that the Appellant would
    meet the financial and the accommodation requirements for entry
    clearance as a spouse.  Although as at the date of the hearing before
    me his English language certificate is no longer valid, it was as at
    the date of the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  Given my findings
    above in relation to the Appellant's wife's inability to cope with
    change, and her reliance on the Appellant, I find that even a temporary
    separation would not be proportionate given the effect on her mental
    health.

32. Taking all of the above into account, and giving particular weight to
    the fact that the Appellant meets the requirements of the immigration
    rules, I find that the balance comes down in favour of the Appellant.
    I find that the Respondent's decision is not proportionate.  I find
    that the Appellant has shown on the balance of probabilities that the
    decision is a breach of his rights, and those of his wife, to a family
    life under Article 8 ECHR.



Decision

33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involves the making of a
    material error of law and I set the decision aside.

34. I remake the decision, allowing the Appellant's appeal on human rights
    grounds.  The Appellant meets the requirements of paragraph EX.1.

35. Given the circumstances of the Appellant's wife's health, I have made
    an anonymity direction.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award.  I have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.  The evidence before the Respondent indicated the  extent  of
the Appellant's wife's mental health needs and the  difficulties  she  would
face accessing treatment  in  Bangladesh,  with  the  resulting  significant
deterioration in her mental health and consequent obstacles to  family  life
with the Appellant continuing there.
