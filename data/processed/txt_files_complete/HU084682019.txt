                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Directions were issued by the Upper Tribunal on 22 June 2020 indicating
    the provisional view, in light of the need to take precautions  against
    the spread of Covid-19 and the overriding objective, that this case was
    suitable to determine whether there was an error of law in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision and if so, whether that decision should be set
    aside, without a hearing.

 2. In written submissions filed on 17 July 2020, the Appellant objected to
    the provisional view that the error of law  issues  can  be  determined
    without a hearing and submits that an oral hearing  is  required.   The
    reasons given for this are that  (a)  the  appeal  concerns  a  serious
    allegation of dishonesty; and (b) there were comments within the  order
    granting permission to appeal, that aspects of  the  grounds  had  less
    weight than others and it was of  concern  to  the  Appellant  that  he
    should have an opportunity to address any such issues orally before the
    Upper tribunal as the written submission  procedure  only  responds  to
    anything in writing from the Respondent, rather than any  questions  or
    concerns from the Upper Tribunal.  In any event, the Appellant did,  in
    accordance with the directions, make detailed written submissions as to
    the substance of the appeal.

 3. The Respondent has not replied at all to the directions  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, which were resent to her on  24  September  2020,  such  that
    there has  been  no  objection  to  the  determination  of  the  issues
    identified above on the papers in this case, however no has there  been
    any written submissions on the substance of the appeal.

 4. In my view, this is a case in which it is suitable for  the  issues  of
    whether the First-tier Tribunal's decision materially erred in law  and
    if so, whether the decision should be set aside, to  be  determined  on
    the papers on the basis of the written submissions made.   This  is  in
    light of the unprecedented circumstances surrounding Covid-19  and  the
    need to take precautions to prevent the spread of the  disease;  is  in
    accordance with the overriding objective for the Upper Tribunal to deal
    with cases fairly and justly in rule 2(1), (2) and (4) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and in circumstances where on the
    facts; the grounds of appeal  relied  upon,  expanded  in  the  written
    submissions on behalf of the Appellant, are  clear  and  comprehensive,
    from which, for the reasons set out below, I find an error  of  law  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal which requires the decision  to
    be set aside.  This decision has therefore been made under rule  34  to
    avoid any further delay to the determination of the issues.

 5. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Randall promulgated on 8 January 2020, in which the
    Appellant's appeal against the decision  to  refuse  his  human  rights
    claim dated 30 April 2019 was dismissed.

 6. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on  14  February  1978,
    who first arrived in the United  Kingdom  with  entry  clearance  as  a
    student on 15 October 2005, with valid leave as  such  to  30  November
    2008.  The Appellant was granted further periods of leave to remain  as
    a student, as a post-study worker, and as a Tier 1 (General) migrant to
    26 October 2019.  The Appellant applied for indefinite leave to  remain
    on the basis of long residence on 15  December  2017,  the  refusal  of
    which on 30 April 2019 is the subject of this appeal.

 7. The Respondent refused the application under paragraphs 276B(ii)(c) and
    para 322(5) of the Immigration Rules on the basis that the  Appellant's
    character and conduct was undesirable for a grant of leave  to  remain.
    The reasons for this were that  there  was  a  significant  discrepancy
    between declarations made for his self-employed  earnings  to  HMRC  as
    part of his tax return for the  year  ending  April  2011  and  to  the
    Respondent in the application for leave to remain for the same  period.
    The Respondent considered that the  Appellant  had  either  dishonestly
    under declared his earnings to HMRC for the purposes of  avoiding  tax,
    or overinflated his earnings in his application to the  Respondent  for
    the purposes of securing leave to remain.  Separately,  the  Respondent
    refused the application under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules
    on the basis that there were  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's reintegration on return to Bangladesh  and  there  were  no
    other exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant of leave to remain.

 8. Judge Randall dismissed the appeal  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  8
    January 2020 on all grounds.   First, the First-tier Tribunal  rejected
    the submission on behalf of  the  Appellant  that  the  allegations  of
    dishonesty could not be raised following the decision of the  Court  of
    Appeal in Ullah v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 550 as these had not been raised in the previous  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal relating to this Appellant in 2016.   Secondly,
    that the Appellant's presence in the United Kingdom was  not  desirable
    and his application failed under paragraph 322(5)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules because he had been dishonest in his tax return submitted to HMRC
    for the year 2010/11, initially declaring self-employed income of  only
    �1345, significantly different to  the  claimed  income  for  the  same
    period from self-employment made in his application for leave to remain
    to the Respondent of �34,900.  Thirdly, in relation to the  Appellant's
    private and family life claim under Article 8, the  Appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules for a grant of leave  to
    remain on private life grounds and the family could return as a unit to
    Bangladesh without any unduly harsh consequences.

The appeal

 9. The Appellant appeals on four grounds  as  follows.   First,  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal reached an irrational conclusion in paragraph 68 of
    the decision, overlooking the fact that  detailed  evidence  about  the
    other person with the same name as the Appellant whose tax affairs said
    to have been mixed up with  his,  could  not  have  been  disclosed  in
    accordance with the stringent data protection laws,  specifically  that
    this would not be covered by permissible disclosure in Chapter 2 of the
    Data Protection Act, nor under the General Data Protection  Regulations
    of 2019.  Further, that the First-tier Tribunal failed to consider that
    data relating to the 2010/11 tax return was not required to  have  been
    retained by the professionals involved; and failed to consider that the
    junior member of staff responsible had been sacked from  the  firm  and
    had returned to Bangladesh (albeit the evidence of this last point  was
    only included with the application for permission to appeal).

10. Secondly that the First-tier Tribunal reached an irrational  conclusion
    in paragraph 70 of the decision and/or  failed  to  apply  the  correct
    standard of proof, by referring to the balance of probabilities and not
    the requirement that the Appellant  provides  an  innocent  explanation
    with the minimum level  of  plausibility.   The  First-tier  Tribunal's
    findings in relation to the Appellant's circumstances and his  father's
    poor health were irrational because it does not necessarily follow that
    the absence of a visit back to Bangladesh and/or the absence of medical
    or psychological help being sought by the Appellant at the time,  leads
    to the conclusion that the Appellant was not concerned for  his  father
    or distracted by the situation.

11. Thirdly, that the First-tier  Tribunal's  conduct  of  the  appeal  was
    procedurally  unfair,  specifically  because  he  was  not  asked   any
    questions about why he had not  been  to  visit  his  father  (this  is
    expressly recognised in paragraph 70 of the decision)  and  if  he  had
    been asked, he would have been able to  explain  and  provide  evidence
    that he was unable to do so because of a lack of annual leave available
    to him from his then new job.  This information is set out in a written
    statement  by  the  Appellant  submitted  with  the   application   for
    permission to appeal supported by documentary evidence submitted at the
    same time.

12. Finally, that the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  consider  material
    evidence before it, namely that contained in  the  Appellant's  written
    statement that HMRC had assessed his  actions  as  a  failure  to  take
    reasonable care and had not imposed a penalty on him  pursuant  to  the
    amendment of his  tax  returns.   It  is  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that his representative failed to include a letter from  HMRC
    confirming the  same  such  that  it  was  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal,  a  copy  being  provided  only  with  the  application   for
    permission to appeal.

13. I pause to note at this stage that although  the  Appellant  has  filed
    further documentation with his application for  permission  to  appeal,
    and again with  written  submissions  in  support  of  the  appeal;  no
    application has been made under Rule 15(2A) to rely on any such further
    evidence, nor have any submissions be made  as  to  why  these  further
    documents should be admitted at this stage.  However, in the event, for
    the reasons set out below, it is not been necessary to have recourse to
    these documents or rely on them to determine the issue of whether there
    was a material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

14. As above, no written submissions were filed on behalf of the Respondent
    in relation to this appeal and I have taken into  account  the  written
    submissions made on behalf of the Appellant, which  in  the  main  were
    materially identical to the grounds of  appeal,  with  some  additional
    authority and reference to legislation only.

Findings and reasons

 1. The first ground of appeal concerns finding  in  paragraph  68  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision, which states as follows:

         "Mr Biggs relied on the letter from ABC Bookkeeping and Accountancy
         dated 9 October 2019 taking responsibility for the error.  However,
         I find the explanation in the letter, that a junior member of staff
         mixed up two clients with the name of Rahman, is  severely  lacking
         in detail.  No other relevant correspondence has been provided;  no
         tax calculations for the other Mr Rahman explaining the mix-up; and
         no evidence of his tax affairs.  I  heard  no  oral  evidence  from
         either the junior member of staff or the writer of the letter  from
         ABC, or the other Mr Rahman.  The Respondent  was  thus  unable  to
         cross-examine them on the subject.  Given the central importance of
         the actions of ABC in the Appellant's explanation as to why he  was
         not dishonest in his 2010/11 tax return, I find that  the  lack  of
         supporting evidence  from  the  company,  apart  from  the  letter,
         significantly undermines the claimed explanation."

 2. Whilst a  number  of  points  made  within  the  paragraph  above  were
    unarguably open to the First-tier Tribunal on the evidence  before  it,
    in particular that the letter from ABC Bookkeeping and Accountancy  was
    lacking in detail and unsupported by any oral evidence from the author;
    other points were not  rationally  open  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    These included adverse reliance on the lack of evidence from the junior
    member of staff and more importantly the  lack  of  evidence  from  the
    other Mr Rahman and about his tax affairs.

 3. In relation to the junior member of staff,  there  was  at  least  some
    evidence in the Appellant's written statement that  he  was  no  longer
    working for ABC Bookkeeping and Accountancy (albeit the  evidence  that
    he had also left the United  Kingdom  was  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal from any source) and no reasons were given by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as to how or why they could be any reasonable  expectation  of
    him therefore giving evidence in the present appeal.

 4. More significantly, the First-tier Tribunal fails to consider that  ABC
    Bookkeeping and Accountancy would not be permitted to release the other
    Mr Rahman's personal details to the Appellant or the Tribunal,  nor  to
    disclose any details of his tax affairs or  calculations  due  to  data
    protection regulations (even if they still had the records  available).
    There is no suggestion that there is any known relationship between the
    Appellant and the other Mr Rahman  such  that  he  could  contact  this
    person directly to give evidence in support of his appeal.

 5. In these circumstances, it was not rationally open  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from the lack of evidence  from  or
    about the other Mr Rahman, or directly from the junior member of  staff
    responsible given the practical and legal restrictions on disclosure in
    relation to these third parties and information about them.  Whilst  it
    is possible that the First-tier Tribunal could have lawfully found that
    the lack of detail in the letter from ABC Bookkeeping and  Accountancy,
    together with the lack of any oral evidence from the author or  another
    employee at the firm was  sufficient  to  significantly  undermine  the
    Appellant's claimed innocent explanation for  the  errors  in  his  tax
    return; it is not sufficiently certain  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    would have inevitably come to the same conclusion on this basis  alone,
    rather than on the basis of the cumulative reasons given  in  paragraph
    68.  For these reasons I find an error of law on the  first  ground  of
    appeal in the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  paragraph  68,
    which contained reliance on findings not rationally open to it  in  the
    wider legal and practical context.

 6. The second  and  third  grounds  of  appeal  concern  the  findings  in
    paragraph 70 of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision,  which  states  as
    follows:

         "In reaching this conclusion, I note that I put it to the Appellant
         and to  Mr  Biggs  that  the  Appellant,  as  a  bookkeeper/payroll
         worker/business-planner  en  route  to  qualifying  in  2015  as  a
         chartered accountant, must have known that, in paying �270  tax  in
         2010/11, he was making too low a tax payment on an income of nearly
         �50,000, most of it from self-employment.  Mr Biggs responded  that
         the Appellant was distracted by his father's stroke  in  Bangladesh
         and by his failure to bring his wife over following  his  marriage.
         These may have been distractions and I note and take  into  account
         paragraph 34 in the case of Khan in  this  respect.   However,  the
         Appellant stated that his father suffered his stroke in August 2011
         and was critically ill for a  prolonged  period  until  2012.   The
         Appellant was free to travel to see him in that period  as  he  had
         leave to remain from July 2011 until July 2013.  It is  clear  that
         he did not go to Bangladesh until October 2012,  when  he  married.
         Although the question as to whether he went was not put to  him  in
         terms, it is clear from his application form that he  did  not  go.
         Had hist father been as ill as he claimed, and, even if he was that
         ill, had the Appellant been as distracted from his tax  affairs  as
         he claimed, in my view it is likely that he would have visited  him
         in Bangladesh.  There is also no medical or psychological  evidence
         about the Appellant to support his claim to have  been  distracted.
         As to the problems he claims were  caused  for  him  by  the  delay
         bringing his wife here, he did not marry until October 2012,  after
         the end of the 2011/12 tax year, so the delay in bringing her after
         marriage could not have been a factor in his failure  to  recognise
         the mistakes in the 2010/11 tax  submission.   Again,  he  was  not
         prevented from going to Bangladesh to marry  her  earlier  than  he
         did, had he wished to."

 7. It can be seen from the part of the  decision  quoted  above  that  the
    Appellant was not asked, in terms, whether he  went  to  Bangladesh  to
    visit his father and consequently it can be inferred that he  was  also
    not asked any questions about why he didn't make such a  visit  to  his
    father given his father's ill-health.  In the absence of  any  evidence
    from the Appellant on this point, the First-tier Tribunal inferred that
    if the Appellant's father had been as ill as claimed and the  appellant
    had as a result been as distracted from his tax affairs as claimed,  it
    is likely he would have visited him  in  Bangladesh  and  further  that
    there was no medical evidence to support the Appellants claim  to  have
    been distracted.  However, I do not find that  these  were  conclusions
    which were rationally open to the First-tier Tribunal in the absence of
    the Appellant being asked about such matters and in the absence of  any
    evidence from him on them.

 8. In particular, it is of note that the Appellant  claims  to  have  been
    distracted by concern his father, not that he claimed to  have  himself
    suffered any medical or mental health problems as a result and although
    it may be that a person's own health could  be  adversely  affected  in
    such circumstances, it is not necessarily  the  case  that  that  would
    happen.  It is of course possible that  a  person  could  be  adversely
    affected  personally  and  emotionally  without  more  adverse   health
    consequences in such circumstances.  Although medical evidence  of  the
    kind suggested by First-tier Tribunal may support or lend  more  weight
    to the claim that a person has been unable to diligently attend to  all
    of their affairs as normal, the reverse is not true that no weight  can
    be attached to family circumstances such as these  in  the  absence  of
    such evidence.

 9. Further, there is no rational basis or reasons given by the  First-tier
    Tribunal for the view that it is likely that if the  situation  was  as
    bad as the Appellant claimed, that he would not have visited his father
    in Bangladesh.   There  was  no  consideration  of  whether  there  was
    alternative or frequent contact  between  family  members,  or  of  any
    practical or financial restrictions on a visit  to  Bangladesh  at  the
    time, any of which may have given reasons as to why there was no visit,
    and even in the absence of a visit, one cannot infer that a person  may
    not have wanted  to  travel  if  they  could  such  that  it  would  be
    reasonable to conclude the claim was exaggerated or untrue.   The  mere
    fact that the Appellant did not return to Bangladesh  when  his  father
    was ill does not rationally undermine the Appellant's claim as  to  the
    seriousness of his illness, nor of the impact it had upon  him  in  the
    United Kingdom.

10. Although not expressly relied  upon  in  the  grounds  of  appeal,  the
    additional  finding  in  paragraph  70  that  the  Appellant's  claimed
    problems in the delay in bringing his wife here were not relevant as he
    did not marry her until after the end of the relevant tax year, clearly
    failed to take into account what is commonly known, that  the  deadline
    for tax returns is not until the end of January in the following  year,
    which was after the Appellant's marriage.

11. For these reasons, I also find that there was an error of  law  in  the
    second and third grounds of appeal, that the findings made by the First-
    tier Tribunal in paragraph 70 were not rationally open to  it  for  the
    reasons given in the decision.

12. The second ground of appeal also encompasses the claim that the  First-
    tier Tribunal applied the wrong standard of proof in a case such as the
    present one, by not asking  the  right  question  in  the  context  the
    findings in paragraph 70 as to whether the Appellant had established an
    innocent explanation meeting the  minimum  level  of  plausibility  and
    concluding in paragraph 71 that the Appellant "has not  established  on
    the balance of probabilities that he was distracted as claimed  at  the
    relevant time.  He has not established on the balance of  probabilities
    that he failed by mistake to check his return.".

13. The First-tier Tribunal's decision does not expressly identify what  is
    known as the ping-pong burden  in  cases  involving  an  allegation  of
    deception,  whereby  the  Respondent  has  the  evidential  burden   of
    establishing a prima facie case  of  dishonesty,  following  which  the
    burden shifts to the Appellant to provide an  innocent  explanation  to
    the minimum level of plausibility, and if he does so, the  final  legal
    burden reverts to the Respondent.   In  the  decision,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal only refers to the burden of proof being on the Respondent and
    in relation to both that and the Article 8 claim, the standard of proof
    is the balance of probabilities with the more  serious  the  allegation
    made, the more evidence is required.  However, in substance, the First-
    tier Tribunal has identified the different stages.

14. In paragraph 67 there is a finding that the Respondent, by  identifying
    the disparity between the income declared to the Respondent  and  HMRC,
    has prima facie, raised the question of the Appellant's dishonesty.  In
    paragraph 69 there is a conclusion that the Appellant has not  provided
    an adequate explanation for the incorrect tax return by reliance on his
    advisors error; albeit this is by reference to the finding being on the
    balance of probabilities.  The same standard of proof, on  the  balance
    of probabilities, has been applied to the Appellant's explanation is as
    to being distracted from his tax returns and his failure to  check  his
    tax returns in paragraph 71 of the  decision.   In  paragraph  73,  the
    First-tier Tribunal finds that the Appellant has  failed  to  establish
    any of his explanations to the required standard of proof and  has  not
    satisfactorily rebutted the allegations made by the Respondent.  It  is
    concluded that the Respondent has therefore discharged  the  burden  of
    proof upon her to  establish  dishonesty.   None  of  these  references
    identify the correct test for the second stage of the assessment, which
    is whether the Appellant has established an innocent explanation to the
    minimum level of plausibility.  At this stage, it is not an  assessment
    of the credibility of  the  Appellant's  evidence  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities and the repeated reference  to  the  latter  discloses  a
    further error of law by the First-tier Tribunal.  Overall,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's findings and conclusion on  dishonesty  are  materially
    undermined by the errors identified.

15. On the basis of the findings already made in the first three grounds of
    appeal, which together require the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    to be set aside in its entirety because the errors go to  the  core  of
    the finding that the Appellant  was  dishonest,  the  final  ground  of
    appeal as  to  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  consider
    material evidence before it, namely HMRC's response to  the  amendments
    of the Appellant's tax  returns,  adds  nothing  of  substance  to  the
    outcome of this appeal.  This is a matter which can any event be relied
    upon by the Appellant if so advised when his appeal is re-made.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the appeal  to
the First-tier Tribunal (Hatton Cross hearing centre) for a de novo  hearing
before any Judge except Judge Randall.

No anonymity direction is made.
