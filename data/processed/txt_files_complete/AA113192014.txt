Representation:

For the Appellant:     Party
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is  a  national  of  Iran  whose  date  of  birth  is  28
    September 1995.  He arrived in the United Kingdom on 29 September  2009
    and claimed asylum on 6 October 2009.  His application was  refused  on
    11 March 2010 but due to his age he  was  granted  discretionary  leave
    until 4 May 2012.  He applied for  further  leave  to  remain  but  his
    application was refused on 25 November 2014.  A decision  was  made  to
    refuse to vary his leave  to  remain  and  to  remove  him  by  way  of
    directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.  He appealed on  asylum  grounds,  humanitarian  grounds  and
    grounds based on Articles 2, 3 and 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.   His  appeal  was  heard  on  4
    February 2015 by First-Tier Tribunal Judge Ford and in a  determination
    promulgated on 19 February 2015 was dismissed on all grounds other than
    Article 8.

2.   The  basis  of  the  findings  under  Article  8  was  the  appellant's
    relationship with a Ms Uddin who gave evidence before the F-tT.  She is
    a British citizen with a firmly established private  life  in  the  UK,
    having been born here, grown up here and educated here.  At the time of
    the determination she was completing her third level education and  was
    shortly due to leave university with a Business  Studies  degree.   She
    wanted to make the best use of the opportunities this would give her in
    the United Kingdom.  The judge did not assume that there  would  be  no
    opportunities for her in Iran but found that she would face very  great
    difficulties in pursuing her private life there because she  was  Sunni
    Muslim.  At paragraph 79 of the determination  the  judge  pointed  out
    that around 9% of Iranians are Sunni Muslims and they face difficulties
    in the free practice of their faith.  Those difficulties were  set  out
    in that paragraph and we need not go into them here.

3.   The parties' relationship commenced in 2012 and Ms Uddin made it  clear
    that she had started it in the full knowledge of the difficulties  they
    could be facing.  She married the  appellant,  a  Shia  Muslim,  in  an
    Islamic ceremony on 22 January 2015.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    recognised that this was not a valid marriage under English  law.   For
    reasons which are explained in the determination the  parties  did  not
    live together and her family were very unhappy with the marriage.  When
    she first met the appellant she did not view him as a possible  partner
    because she knew that he had no immigration status, had  no  money,  or
    job and was not engaged in  further  education.   Her  Farsi  was  very
    limited.

4.   The judge found that the appellant could  not  show  that  he  met  the
    requirements  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  fiancï¿½/partner.   She  was
    satisfied however that the decision of the Secretary of State  did  not
    involve a proper balancing of all the factors relevant to the Article 8
    proportionality exercise.  She referred to what she called  exceptional
    circumstances.  At paragraph 90 she referred to  the  difficulties  the
    couple would face in trying to maintain a family relationship  in  Iran
    and  the  difficulties  that  Ms  Uddin  would  have  in  creating  and
    maintaining a private life in Iran.  The pressures would  be  so  great
    that even attaching little weight to their family life and balancing it
    against the public interest of maintaining proper  immigration  control
    the judge was satisfied that the decision  was  disproportionate.   The
    judge was not satisfied that the decision was  justified  on  conducive
    grounds as she was not satisfied that the appellant had been  convicted
    of any offence or that his continued presence in the UK posed a risk to
    the public or made it any more difficult to prevent crime or  disorder.
    It was not justified as a deterrent.  This  was  against  a  background
    that he had pleaded guilty to one count of possessing cannabis for  his
    own use and had been charged with certain other offences.

5.   The Secretary of State  has  appealed  against  the  allowance  of  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.   For  the  sake  of  continuity  we  will
    continue to refer to her as the respondent.   Putting  it  shortly  the
    grounds of appeal were that the judge had failed to have regard to  the
    threshold of "unjustifiably harsh consequences" in  her  assessment  of
    the  proportionality  of  the  decision   outside   the   Rules.    The
    determination disclosed no consideration of the consequences that would
    ensue following from the separation of  the  appellant  and  Ms  Uddin.
    Furthermore it was submitted that the judge  had  made  a  free-feeling
    Article  8  assessment  unencumbered  by  the  Rules  specifically   in
    referring to Ms Uddin throughout the determination as  the  appellant's
    wife or partner or indeed in finding that there was family life between
    them.  The judge  recognised  that  she  was  not  the  spouse  of  the
    appellant and that they did not  co-habit.   In  terms  of  the  Rules,
    particularly GEN1.2 of Appendix FM they were  not  "partners"  and  the
    relationship was not one whereby Appendix FM  could  be  engaged.   The
    judge should  have  considered  whether  or  not  the  removal  of  the
    appellant would lead to unjustifiably harsh consequences  in  light  of
    the consideration that he did not have a partner in the United  Kingdom
    in terms of the Rules.  He would be separated from a person to whom  he
    was not married and with whom he did not  live  and,  given  that,  the
    interference was proportionate in the public interest.  The  judge  had
    focussed her consideration on whether or not Ms Uddin  could  accompany
    the appellant to Iran.

6.   Permission to appeal was granted on the  basis  that  it  was  arguable
    that the judge's consideration of Appendix FM as  if  the  couple  were
    validly married was inappropriate.

7.   For the respondent Mr Jarvis said that the determination could  not  be
    criticised in respect of the asylum claim but significant errors  could
    be detected  in  relation  to  the  consideration  of  Article  8  from
    paragraph 68 onwards.  EX.1 was  mentioned  at  paragraph  82  and  the
    question of insurmountable obstacles but when all was said and done the
    appellant was outwith the Rules.  The approach was flawed  in  relation
    to the appellant's criminality.  It was accepted by the appellant  that
    he had pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis  and  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter had raised his character at paragraph 49 under reference
    to paragraph 353B of the Immigration Rules.  The judge did not have the
    power to say that she was not satisfied that the decision was justified
    on conducive grounds as she did at paragraph 90.  That was a matter for
    the Secretary of State.  The judge could, however, take account of  the
    criminal history in the balancing exercise.

 8. On the basis of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387  the  appellant,  whose
    position was precarious, could only succeed outside the Rules  in  very
    exceptional circumstances.

 9. There was nothing exceptional or compelling in the circumstances of  Ms
    Uddin as identified by the First-tier Tribunal.

10. All the judge had done was to consider the consequences for the partner
    being returned to Iran.  She had not  looked  at  the  consequences  of
    separation of the parties or of the appellant's going out and trying to
    obtain clearance out-of-country.  This was a precarious case.  What the
    judge found to be exceptional was already covered by the Rules and  the
    appellant was clearly excluded by the Rules.

11. Mr Jarvis also referred to the case of Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  He
    referred in particular to paragraphs 21, 22 and 25.  Paragraph 25 is in
    the following terms:


        "25. The statement made in Mrs Agyarko's letter of application of
             26 September 2012 that "she may be separated from" her husband
             was very weak, and was not supported by any evidence which
             might lead to the conclusion that insurmountable obstacles
             existed to them pursuing their family life together overseas.
             There was no witness statement from Mrs Agyarko or Mr Benette
             to explain what obstacles might exist. The mere facts that Mr
             Benette is a British citizen, has lived all his life in the
             United Kingdom and has a job here - and hence might find it
             difficult and might be reluctant to re-locate to Ghana to
             continue their family life there - could not constitute
             insurmountable obstacles to his doing so".


12. In the instant case there was no evidence for the suggestion  that  the
    appellant could not work or live her own life.  Her religion could  not
    be an insurmountable obstacle given that 6.5 to 7 million  shared  that
    religion in Iran.  Little weight  could  be  given  to  a  relationship
    formed when the appellant's immigration status was  precarious  and  it
    was perverse to say there were insurmountable obstacles in the teeth of
    Section 117B.  The structure of the determination was wrong as was  the
    understanding of the relationship between the Rules and  considerations
    outside of the Rules.  The proportionality assessment was unlawful  and
    the decision should be set aside and re-made.

13. Although the appellant was present and assisted by  an  interpreter  he
    had no submissions to make but we were addressed by Ms Uddin.  She  was
    unable to assist us in relation to  any  legal  matters  but  drew  our
    attention to certain difficulties which she said existed in the way  of
    their going to Iran.  She also indicated that they had been appallingly
    represented,  as  was  noted  by  Judge  Ford.   A  number  of  witness
    statements had been given to the solicitor as well as pictures but  the
    solicitor did not turn up or lodge the documents.  She said  that  when
    the appellant left Iran at 14 he missed his education and he would  not
    be able to do anything if he went back.  They  could  not  get  married
    since he had no legal papers.  Since they were a  mixed  marriage  they
    would not survive a day in Iran.  He would not survive because  of  his
    tattoos, the way he dressed and the way his hair was  cut.   She  would
    not try to justify his criminal activities but indicated that  she  had
    now graduated in Business Studies.





Conclusions

14. We indicated at the time and repeat that  we  are  satisfied  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in law in relation to the  Article  8  claim.
    It is plain that the appellant cannot succeed under the  Rules  but  in
    looking for  exceptional  circumstances  in  terms  of  Article  8  the
    determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  concentrated  only  on  such
    difficulties  as  Ms  Uddin  might  face  in  Iran.    There   was   no
    consideration of the proportionality of the parties being separated  in
    circumstances were they were not validly married, did not live together
    and had entered their relationship  when  the  appellant's  immigration
    status was precarious.  The judge was not satisfied that the  appellant
    had told the truth about not being in touch with  his  family  and  was
    satisfied that he had family members in Iran including his  mother  and
    uncle.  No consideration was given to the  question  of  the  appellant
    himself going to Iran and making an application out-of-country to  join
    Ms Uddin.

15. We think that these are material considerations  which  ought  to  have
    been taken account of in the balancing exercise and in the  absence  of
    this the decision is flawed.

16. Even if Mr Jarvis is correct in his criticism of the  F-tT's  treatment
    of the appellant's criminality we do not think that this  is  material.
    However the F-tT approached the matter she would not have applied  much
    weight to his character and that would have been a matter for her.

17. Having indicated that we were setting aside the decision in relation to
    Article 8 we enquired of Ms Uddin whether she was in a position to make
    any further submissions or lead any further evidence  before  us  since
    the decision had to be re-made.  She was not in a position to do so and
    given the comments by  the  F-tT  about  the  service  with  which  the
    appellant was provided by his legal representatives, then we  were  not
    surprised.  The decision will have to be re-made taking account of  any
    evidence which may be lead as to the effect of any  separation  of  the
    parties and any difficulties or otherwise which the appellant may  face
    in going to Iran and applying from there.   In  this  particular  case,
    unusually, we have taken the view that it would be better to remit  the
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal for the decision to be made.

18. We made it plain to the appellant and Ms Uddin  that  it  would  be  in
    their best interests if possible to obtain the services of a solicitor.



19. There is no basis for overturning the findings  of  fact  made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal or the decision other than that relating to Article
    8 and they will stand.


Notice of Decision

 1. The respondent's appeal is allowed and is remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for the decision to be re-made in relation to Article 8.   The
    findings of fact  set  out  in  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal will stand as will the decision  on  all  matters  other  than
    Article 8.
