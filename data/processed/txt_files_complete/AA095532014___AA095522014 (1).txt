               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellants:    Ms S Anzani of Counsel  instructed by Nag Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka.  The  first  named  appellant
    was born on [ ] 1985 and the second named appellant is his wife who was
    born on [ ] 1988.  The fist appellant entered the United Kingdom on 3rd
    December, 2011 and claimed asylum on 10th October,  2013.   The  second
    appellant's  appeal  falls  to  be  decided  in  line  with  the  first
    appellant's.  Both  appellants  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent taken in the case of both of them on 24th October,  2014  to
    direct their removal as illegal entrants.

2.   The appellants' appealed to the First Tier Tribunal and  their  appeals
    had been heard on 21st September,  2015  in  Manchester  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Manuel.  Unfortunately,  both  representatives  were  in
    agreement that in her determination, at paragraph 52 she made an  error
    of law.

3.   The judge referred to the fact that a  letter  was  placed  before  her
    dated 29th May, 2015 from advocates in Sri Lanka.   Unfortunately,  she
    does not actually deal with the letter by explaining  its  contents  or
    purpose.  Both representatives agreed that the determination could  not
    stand and invited me to remit it for hearing afresh by a judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel.

4.   I am satisfied that the determination does contain an error of law  and
    the most efficient and effective means of dealing with this matter  are
    for it to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing de novo by
    a judge other than First Tier Tribunal Judge Manuel.  No findings shall
    stand.  A Sri Lankan Sinhalese interpreter will be required  and  three
    hours should be allowed for the hearing of the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is remitted to the First Tier Tribunal for hearing  afresh  by  a
judge other than Judge Manuel.

Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley
