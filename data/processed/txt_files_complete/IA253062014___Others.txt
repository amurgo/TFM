                            DECISION AND REASONS

     Introduction

 1. In February 2013 the first and third appellants  made  applications  to
    the Secretary of State for leave to remain  as  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrants.  They did so on the basis of funding of �50,000 being jointly
    available  to  them  from  Future  Venture  Capital  (FVC)  which  they
    described in their applications as a  fund  "set  up  through"  "Future
    Capital Partners (FS) Ltd (FCP(FS)).  They planned to run  a  newspaper
    business and aimed to provide a newspaper within the Harrow and Wembley
    area of Greater London targeting the Asian  community.   The  intention
    was to report local issues along with promoting businesses  and  events
    taking place.  Once established the business would expand across  other
    districts.

 2. The first appellant's  application,  which  included  her  husband  the
    second appellant as a dependant, was made on  25  February  2014  after
    expiry of her leave to remain  as  a  post-study  work  migrant  on  16
    February 2014.  The third appellant's application on which her  husband
    and son were included (the fourth and fifth appellants) was made on  19
    February 2014 prior to expiry of her leave as a student on 23  February
    2014.  All appellants are national of India.   They  were  unsuccessful
    for reasons given in refusal letters addressed to the third, fourth and
    fifth appellants dated 3 June 2014 and 30 May 2014 in relation  to  the
    second of the first and second appellants.

 3. Specifically in respect of the first and third appellants, the  reasons
    were largely in identical terms.  Both applications were refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) of the  Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  of  false
    representations having been made.  A search of  the  Financial  Conduct
    Authority register had revealed no connection between FVC and  FCP(FS).
    Additionally,  no  points  were  awarded  in  respect  of  Appendix  A:
    Attributes.   As  to  Applicant  has  access  to  funds  required,  the
    Secretary of State  explained  that  the  evidence  produced  with  the
    applications did not meet  the  criteria  specified  under  Appendix  A
    because neither FVC nor FCP(FS) Ltd were  independent  venture  capital
    firms directly regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.  No  trace
    had been found to confirm that either had permission to  operate  as  a
    Venture Capital firm by the FCA.  Accordingly, the Secretary  of  state
    was not satisfied that the applicants  had  access  to  not  less  than
    �50,000 from  one  or  more  registered  Venture  Capital  firms  under
    provision b(i) in the first row  of  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Further, the respondent considered  the  appellants
    had not provided any evidence, qualification, for points under  any  of
    the other provisions in the first row of Table 4 of Appendix A  of  the
    Rules.  It followed for those  reasons  that  no  points  were  awarded
    relating to Funds held and regulated  financial  institution(s)  and/or
    Funds disposable in the United Kingdom.

 4. Thus the decision was made by the Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  the
    applications also under 245DD of the Rules as they did not satisfy  the
    requirement at paragraph 245DD(a),  245DD(b).   The  first  and  second
    appellants were informed that, despite an  earlier  application  having
    been  made  on  13  February  2014,  at  the  time  of  the  subsequent
    application neither had leave to remain.  As a consequence there was no
    right of appeal.  For reasons that are obvious from the  chronology  in
    respect of the third, fourth and fifth  appellants,  it  was  confirmed
    they did have rights of appeal.  All appellants however appealed to the
    First-tier Tribunal, the appeals were heard on different  occasions  by
    different judges.  First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Courtney  was  satisfied
    that the previous rejected applications had  been  accompanied  by  the
    specified fee and thus therefore validly made.  She heard  the  appeals
    on 23 January 2015 and for reasons given in her decision  sent  out  to
    the parties  on  9  February,  she  dismissed  the  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on Human Rights grounds.

    The  proceedings  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  -  First  and   Second
    Appellants

 5. Evidence produced to FtT J  Courtney  included  a  report  from  Daniel
    Tunkel, a partner with Harold Kennedy LLP who  sought  to  explain  the
    regulatory framework.  It had  been  prepared  in  respect  of  another
    appeal relating to funding from Nomisma Venture Capital LLP.  The judge
    also heard evidence from the first  appellant  and  in  particular  had
    regard to a letter from FVC dated 2 June 2014 which the first appellant
    had referred to in cross examination.   That  letter  had  acknowledged
    that FCP(FS) had not registered FVC as  the  appointed  representatives
    acting on behalf of the fund, and that they had recently changed  their
    FCA permissions due to a restructuring of their business following  the
    2014 budget.  The letter continued:

         "... this situation is out  with  our  control  and,  unfortunately
         their offer to you facilitated through ourselves will  have  to  be
         withdrawn and replaced, as it will now NOT conform  to  the  strict
         requirements of The Border Control Agency.  As previously mentioned
         at the time of application, we had secured three offers of  funding
         for your venture, and  we  will  now  replace  the  Future  Capital
         Partners offer, with an offer from one of the  two  other  sponsors
         that was in place at  the  time,  which  is  best  suited  to  your
         proposition."

 6. In respect of the refusal under paragraph 322  (1A),  the  judge  found
    that it  was  reasonable  for  the  first  appellant  to  rely  on  the
    assertions made in the material presented with the application  and  it
    had not been established that these were made by the first  appellant's
    advisers knowing  them  to  be  false.   She  was  satisfied  that  the
    Secretary of State had not discharged in the  burden  of  proving  that
    there had been dishonesty on the part of  the  first  appellant  or  by
    someone acting on her behalf.

 7. The judge then turned to the refusal relating to Appendix A Attributes.
     She contrasted the circumstances  of  the  firms  referred  to  in  Mr
    Tunkel's  report  which  she  described  as  firmly  sitting  within  a
    regulatory framework, with a search  undertaken  by  the  Secretary  of
    State which revealed that whilst FCP(FS) was a  regulated  entity,  FVC
    was not listed nor was it an appointed representative  or  tied  agent.
    The judge went on to conclude:

         "20:

         Save for Mr Bates' assertion that there was  some  kind  of  verbal
         contract there is no evidence whatsoever that there has  ever  been
         any operational connection between FVC and FCP.  It is  clear  from
         his letter of 2 June 2014 that he  was  mistaken  as  to  the  true
         nature  of  the  relationship  between  the  two  entities.    Even
         accepting that Mr Tunkel's exposition of the regulatory  regime  is
         correct, the first  appellant  has  not  established  that  FCP,  a
         regulated firm, made funding available to her via  FVC.  a  venture
         capital investment vehicle.

         21.

         New evidence has been supplied showing that in June 2014 the  first
         appellant was offered funding  by  Philpott  Reed  Venture  Capital
         Fund, a fund set out by Philpott Reed LLP (which is registered with
         the FCA).  I am precluded by Section 85A(3) of the  2002  Act  from
         taking  this  evidence  into  account  since  it   post-dates   the
         application (and the decision).  Mrs  [R]  cannot  succeed  in  her
         application under paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules."

 8. Article 8 ground had also been relied on and the judge gave reasons why
    she did not consider there would be a breach in the event of removal.

    Third, Fourth and Fifth Appellants

 9. The appeals by the third, fourth and fifth  appellants  were  heard  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Dickson on 6 March 2015.  There was  no  oral
    evidence.  The judge had before him a  copy  of  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Courtney as well as,  it  appears,  the  same
    bundle of documents that had been produced at the earlier  hearing  and
    the skeleton argument.  It was argued that no account should  be  taken
    of the earlier decision of Judge Courtney but  Judge  Dickson  was  not
    persuaded and he regarded it as a decision  relating  to  an  identical
    application.

10. Specifically in respect of  the  paragraph  322  (1A)  decision,  Judge
    Dickson made it clear that he agreed  with  Judge  Courtney's  findings
    that no fraudulent documents had been submitted and that the  Secretary
    of State had not suggested that the authors three letters that had been
    submitted with the applications were  anything  other  than  bona  fide
    reputable entities.  He too concluded that the burden of proof had  not
    been discharged; there had been no dishonesty on behalf  of  the  third
    appellant or someone acting on her behalf.  His conclusion in  relation
    to the issue arising on Appendix A Attributes was in these terms:

         "In paragraph 19 Judge Courtney  considered  whether  Mrs  [R]  had
         shown that she had access to not less than �50,000 from one or more
         registered Venture Capital firms regulated by the FCA and had taken
         full account of Mr Tunkel's expert opinion.  She  has  pointed  out
         that there was no evidence  whatsoever  that  there  has  been  any
         operation or connection between FVC and FCP  apart  from  Mr  Bates
         assertion that there was some kind of verbal contact.  It was clear
         from Mr Bates' letter of 2 June 2014 that he was mistaken as to the
         true nature of the relationship between the  two  entities.   Judge
         Courtney considered that Mrs [R] had not established  that  FCP,  a
         regulated firm, made funding available to her  by  FVC,  a  Venture
         Capital Investment vehicle (paragraphs 19 and 20).

         30.

         I would agree with [the Presenting Officer's] submissions that  the
         appellants cannot succeed in their application as it  was  accepted
         by Mr Bates for the offer of funding to FVC had been withdrawn, and
         there was further funding from another Venture Capital  Fund  after
         the decision.  Judge Courtney  has  reached  the  decision  on  the
         identical matters and I accept  her  conclusions  as  well  as  the
         submissions of [the Presenting Officer].   It  follows  that  these
         appeals must be dismissed."

11. No anonymity direction was made in either set of appeals, and  we  have
    not been invited to make such an order.

12. Permission to appeal the decision  of  FtT  J  Courtney  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  grounds  of
    challenge, assert the judge  had  erred  by  not  allowing  the  appeal
    "partly under 322(1A)", that there was a fundamental flaw in  that  the
    FCA was not equipped to show a connection between  the  funds  and  the
    firm and a search could not have possibly be shown the connection.

13. In granting permission, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lambert  considered
    that the failure to allow the appeal under paragraph 322(1A)  was  more
    appropriately addressed under the  slip  rule  than  by  a  substantive
    appeal.  In respect of the funding point the judge  was  persuaded  the
    ground was arguable.  The  third,  fourth  and  fifth  appellants  were
    unsuccessful initially in seeking permission to appeal, but  permission
    was granted by the Upper Tribunal on a renewed application which relied
    on two grounds settled by Mr Pennington-Benton.  The first was that the
    First-tier Tribunal judge had erred in his assessment of regulatory law
    and in particular the  relationship  between  FVC  and  FCP  and  their
    regulation by the FCA.  The  second  ground  was  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in its interpretation an application of  the  Rules.
    This was  a  PBS  application  and  the  applicants  sent  all  of  the
    information requested by the SSHD.

    The Relevant Legislation

14. Paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules provides:

         "Requirements for leave to remain:

         under this rule, an applicant must  meet  the  requirements  listed

         will be granted.  If the applicant does not meet these requirements
         the application will be refused.
         Requirements:
          a) The applicant must not  fall  for  refusal  under  the  general

                     and valid, and
                  7) ...

16. The applicants produced with their  applications  three  letters.   The
    first (letter A) was on the letterhead of Future Venture  Capital  Ltd.
    This letter explains in its opening paragraph:

         "Future Venture Capital is a "Fund" set up through  Future  Capital
         Partners (FS) Ltd who are authorised  and  regulated  by  the  FCA,
         registration  number  -  464972.   Future  Capital   Partners   has
         permissions to carry out investments and operate therefore [sic} as
         a Venture Capital firm."

    The author Mr Bates explains that he  had  been  asked  to  consider  a
    business proposal submitted by the first and third  appellants  and  he
    expresses his pleasure in confirming that the fund will make  available
    �50,000 to each of the business which they propose to run.  As part  of
    the funding conditions the fund will take a shareholding in the company
    set up by the entrepreneurial team and that the company:

         "... shall be managed by our accountants:  Active  Corporate  Audit
         LLP, who shall appoint a representative of the fund  to  sit  as  a
         board member in the company to ensure business decision is taken to
         safeguard the funds' interests and to help develop the company  for
         the mutual benefit of both fund members and the entrepreneur team."

    The letter was signed by a representative (possibly Mr Bates) of Future
    Venture Capital Ltd and the first and third appellants.  It concludes:

         "Future Venture  Capital  is  an  authorised  fund  through  Future
         Capital Partners (FS) Ltd who was authorised and regulated  by  the
         FCA number - 464972."

17. A second letter (letter B) dated 11 February 2014 addressed 'To Whom It
    May Concern' explains that Asim Khan on behalf of Ramsay Employment Law
    witnessed the signatures of Mr Bates acting on behalf of Future Venture
    Capital Ltd and the first and second appellants.

18. The third letter (letter C) is on the letterhead  of  Active  Corporate
    Audit LLP.  The  company  registration  number  is  given,  as  is  the
    company's registered office in New City Road, Glasgow.  It is not clear
    whether this is also the trading address of the firm.   The  letter  is
    addressed to the third appellant and dated 11 February 2014 and  is  in
    the following terms:

    Discussion

19. At the outset of the Hearing Mr Pennington-Benton raised the matter  of
    the evidence before the judge regarding the withdrawal of  funding  and
    substitution of a new offer.  We did not need  further  submissions  on
    this aspect; the task before the First-tier Tribunal  was  to  consider
    whether the decision of the Secretary of State was in  accordance  with
    the Immigration Rules.  Any change in the circumstances from those that
    were before the Secretary of State which might result in the  Rules  no
    longer being complied with would be a matter impacting on any leave  if
    the original decision was found to be correct.

20. We also observed that the indication  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    granting  permission  to  appeal  that  the  slip  rule  would  be  the
    appropriate course in respect of the failure by the Secretary of  State
    to make out a case under paragraph 322 was misconceived.  It  is  clear
    that the First-tier Tribunal in both appeals were  satisfied  that  the
    Secretary of State had been unsuccessful in  demonstrating  that  false
    documents or representations had been submitted whether or not  to  the
    applicant's knowledge in relation to the applications.  It follows that
    the Secretary of State is unable to rely  on  the  assertion  that  any
    future application would be adversely affected  pursuant  to  paragraph
    320(7A).

21. Although Mr Pennington-Benton began his submissions with argument  that
    the decision by the Secretary of State was based on a misconception  as
    to whether FCP(FS) Ltd was regulated (it was) and that FVC  was  simply
    the fund; this warranted the case being "remitted" to the Secretary  of
    State. We were not persuaded this was the correct  approach  to  adopt.
    The starting point must be the Rules and we encouraged  Mr  Pennington-
    Benton to examine the relevant provision of paragraph 41-SD in order to
    consider whether the applications should have succeeded.   He  candidly
    accepted that they could not in the light of the provisions set out  in
    41-SD(c)(iii) (see above), because of various deficiencies in letter  C
    from the accountants, principally because it was not written on  behalf
    of FCP(FS) Ltd.   He  nevertheless  maintained  that  the  applications
    before the Secretary of State should have succeeded because this  point
    had not been taken.

22. We were unable to accept that  this  was  the  correct  approach.   The
    Secretary of State had decided the points she  wished  to  run  in  her
    refusal letter.  The task before the judges was to decide  whether  the
    decision was in accordance  with  the  law  including  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Tribunal in RM (Kwok On Tong: HC395 para 320) India  [2006]
    UKAIT 00039 affirmed that Kwok On Tong  is  still  good  law:  a  judge
    cannot allow an appeal on the ground  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance  with  the  Rules  unless  satisfied  that  the  appropriate
    requirements were met. This requires procedural fairness where an issue
    has not been previously raised but it cannot be  said  the  failure  to
    meet the relevant requirements of 41-SD came as a surprise by the  time
    the matter came before us or before the F-tT. The  appellants  knew  of
    their difficulties when they received the letter from Mr Bates dated  2
    June 2014 well before the appeals were heard in the F-tT.  Furthermore,
    the Secretary of State clearly explained in her decision  letters  that
    the applications had not satisfied the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.  Her reasons were misconceived in part in  that  clearly  Future
    Capital Partners (FS) Ltd were  directly  regulated  by  the  Financial
    Conduct Authority.  It was however incumbent upon the first  and  third
    appellants to demonstrate the availability of funds by reference to the
    specified documents  in  paragraph  41-SD  including  the  accountant's
    letter.  No doubt the document produced was an original document and on
    the accountant's official paper.  But as  accepted  by  Mr  Pennington-
    Benton, it was not issued by  an  accountant  engaged  by  the  Venture
    Capital firm FCP(FS) Ltd. This was not the only  difficulty:  letter  A
    from FCV Ltd did not meet the requirements of 41-SD (d)  since  it  was
    not from the third party holding the money (said to be FCP(FS) Ltd).

23. We are satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal  Judges  erred  in  their
    decisions by placing reliance on the  withdrawal  of  funding  for  the
    reasons given above. The evidence before them as  to  the  relationship
    between FVC and FCP(FS) Ltd was a distraction and not directly relevant
    to the issues which they had to determine. Instead,  they  should  have
    examined the Rules and Appendix A as their  starting  point.  Had  they
    done so, they would have seen that in order  to  achieve  the  required
    points in para 36 of Appendix A, certain specified documents needed  to
    be produced. The documents produced did not meet the clear criteria  in
    41-SD and the appeals could not therefore succeed.

24. Accordingly, although we consider  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  these
    appeals erred in law, we do not consider their decisions require to  be
    set aside.  Remittal of the cases is to the First-tier  Tribunal  or  a
    remaking by us could only result in the  same  bleak  outcome  for  the
    appellants which is for these appeals to be dismissed.  We endorse  the
    First-tier Tribunal's findings as to para 322(iA) but our decision  has
    to be that the appeals are dismissed.
