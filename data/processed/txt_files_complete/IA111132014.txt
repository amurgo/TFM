For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by Mujeeb  Pasha  Mohammed  with  the  permission  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin given on 9 December 2014 against  the
    decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Braybrook  promulgated  on  29
    October 2014 dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's
    decision to refuse to grant him leave to enter the United  Kingdom  and
    to cancel his existing leave to remain made on 21 February 2014.

2.   The appellant is a national of India and was born on 29 November  1979.
     He made an application for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant on 10 June 2013.  In support of  that  application  he  claimed
    points of past earnings from employment and also from his self-employed
    income as an IT engineer.  His application was granted on 24 June  2013
    and he was issued  with  leave  to  remain  in  the  Tier  1  (General)
    category.  At this point the respondent was  satisfied  that  the  past
    earnings were genuine.

3.   On 20 February 2014 after a period of absence abroad the appellant  was
    questioned on his arrival  back  in  the  United  Kingdom  at  Heathrow
    Airport.  As a  result  of  alleged  deficiencies  in  his  answers  in
    interview a decision was made on 21 February 2014 to refuse  him  leave
    to enter which had the effect of cancelling his leave to remain.   That
    decision was made on the  basis  that  he  was  claimed  to  have  used
    deception in his application of 10 June  2013  to  remain  by  claiming
    points based on self-employed earnings that he had not in fact  earned.
    The respondent also applied paragraph 320(7A) of the Immigration Rules.

4.   It is common ground that the burden of proof where  as  here  leave  is
    cancelled on the basis  of  general  grounds  for  refusal  is  on  the
    respondent.  The standard is to a balance of probabilities although  in
    circumstances where a breach  of  paragraph  320(7A)  applies  and  the
    submission of false documents is relied upon the bar is raised, see the
    decision of Mr Justice  Burton  in  Ozhogina  and  Tarasova  (deception
    within para 320(7B) - nannies) Russia [2011] UKUT 00197 (IAC).

5.   It is the  appellant's  case  that  although  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision identified the correct burden and  standard  of  proof
    including the raised  standard  required  to  establish  dishonesty  or
    deception needed to render a false representation a grant for mandatory
    refusal the Tribunal Judge failed to apply that burden and standard  in
    reaching the decision that she did.

6.   The appellant's application letter stated he had  substantial  earnings
    as a self-employed freelance IT engineer.  His tax return for  the  tax
    year 2012/2013 reflected such earnings.  Bank statements  and  invoices
    were before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, who considered them and  his
    evidence  together  with  the  record  of  his  interviews   with   the
    Immigration Officer on 20 and 21 February 2014 and  this  evidence  was
    reviewed in paragraphs 9 to 14 of the Determination and Reasons.

7.   Having reviewed that evidence the Tribunal Judge went  on  to  conclude
    in paragraph 15 of the Determination and Reasons as follows:

          "I have looked at the evidence in  the  round  and  concluded  the
         information in his application was not  supported  in  any  way  by
         documentary or other evidence",

    then a sentence  that  is  not  necessary  to  recite.   The  paragraph
    concluded:

          "I am satisfied  that  the  appellant  has  put  forward  a  false
         representation in the application  form  as  to  his  self-employed
         earnings and that the entry clearance  fell  to  be  refused  under
         paragraph 320(7A)."

8.   Although there is no stated conclusion that this  finding  of  a  false
    representation  in  relation  to  the  self-employed  earnings  in  the
    application form was false on the basis of false documents that was the
    clear implication of the context of the  paragraph  for  the  preceding
    paragraphs highlighted 1) that the amount of tax  to  be  collected  of
    �300 bore no relationship to the asserted self-employed net earnings of
    �25,587 for the tax year 2012/2013, the appellant produced no plausible
    explanation or documentation in relation to this, 2) his  bank  account
    showed that the amounts purportedly credited to his business account in
    payment of invoices were "on almost every occasion  almost  immediately
    withdrawn  almost  in  total",  3)  a  rejection  of  the   appellant's
    explanation that substantial sums had to be withdrawn because  of  late
    payment of invoices and the need to meet  expenses  when  his  expenses
    merely consisted of travel and tools for cabling,  4)  his  failure  to
    remember the names of any clients in interview when it was a small pool
    many of whom had repeat orders, 5)  the  absence  of  any  invoices  or
    remittances post his application when his account was that he  remained
    self-employed until December 2013.  All this was  material  upon  which
    such a finding could properly  be  made  on  the  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal Judge.

9.   We are satisfied that in reaching the conclusion  that  she  did  there
    was no failure to apply the burden and standard of  proof  in  reaching
    the determination that the Tribunal Judge did.  Clearly  there  was  an
    evidential basis upon which the  burden  could  be  discharged  by  the
    respondent in relation  to  the  provision  of  false  documents.   The
    Tribunal Judge was entitled to conclude as she did.  There was no error
    of law in relation to the conclusion to which we came and  this  appeal
    is dismissed.
