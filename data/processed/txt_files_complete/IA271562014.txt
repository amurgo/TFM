For the Appellant:     Ms A Watterson (Irving and Co Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)



                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is the appeal of Muhammad Jadoon, a citizen of  Pakistan  born
         13 August 1998, against  the  decision  of  12  June  2014  by  the
         Respondent to refuse to grant him an extension of his discretionary
         leave to remain.

      2. The underlying relationship  with  Jane  Marcia  Higgs,  a  British
         citizen, whom the Appellant  had  married  on  29  July  2010,  had
         previously been accepted  as  genuine  and  founded  the  grant  of
         discretionary leave to remain to the Appellant. The application  to
         extend leave to remain was refused because the  Respondent  was  no
         longer satisfied that the relationship was a genuine and subsisting
         one, as the Appellant and his partner had been  interviewed  on  29
         April 2014 and in  the  view  of  the  decision  maker  there  were
         material discrepancies in their answers to certain  questions.  The
         Interview Summary Sheet provided by the Respondent, upon which  the
         refusal letter was based, identified the following inconsistencies:

          a) As to the date of the proposal, New Years Eve  2008  (him)  or
             2009 (her);

          b) The wedding date: 27/28 July (her) or 29 July (him);

          c) Neither recalled the full names of their witnesses, a  married
             couple;

          d) As to his studies; she said he was studying law when she first
             met him and that he went to college in London for three days a
             week, whereas he said that he studied law in Pakistan and then
             business in London, and that he travelled to London five  days
             a week;

          e) She referenced joint savings of �4,000 whereas he put this  at
             �5,000, and added  that  she  held  �10,000  in  a  Nationwide
             account;

          f) She said that they were saving for a mortgage, whereas he said
             they were saving for a mortgage and a wedding reception;

          g) She said he has a Samsung mobile phone whereas he produced  an
             old Nokia phone at the hearing, which  he  said  he  had  been
             using pending the repair of the Samsung; they differed  as  to
             the timing of her purchase of an i-Phone.

      3. The Appellant brought an appeal against that  decision,  and  Judge
         Kempton determining  it  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  upheld  the
         Respondent's position, because of a lack of post-decision  evidence
         as to cohabitation, particularly focussing on a lack of evidence of
         Council Tax or rental agreement payments in their joint names,  and
         a lack of wedding photographs or supporting  witnesses.  She  noted
         that there were few discrepancies  in  the  interview  records  but
         thought this might be due to the  Appellant  and  Ms  Higgs  having
         known each other for a long time. These considerations led  her  to
         conclude that though the marriage might have been  genuine  at  the
         time it was contracted, the parties to it had not  shown  they  had
         remained in a subsisting relationship.  She  therefore  found  that
         they did not qualify under the Appendix FM route as partners  in  a
         genuine and subsisting relationship.

      4. An application for permission to appeal was  supported  by  grounds
         which argued that the Judge had been wrong  to  consider  the  case
         under the framework of Appendix FM given that this was a case where
         DLR had been granted before 9 July 2012 , and that  the  Judge  had
         been wrong to conclude that the  discrepancies  identified  by  the
         Respondent in the refusal letter had been "explained away  in  oral
         evidence" without treating  that  as  counting  in  favour  of  the
         Appellant's credibility, and additionally contending that  she  had
         wrongly  overlooked  the  presence  of  bank   statements   showing
         cohabitation and a tenancy agreement that showed that  Council  Tax
         was included as part of their rent.

      5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Kekic on 7 April 2015 and
         following a hearing to establish the  question  of  error  of  law,
         Judge Conway found that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal had
         to be set aside because the grounds of appeal were made out:  there
         had indeed been inadequate recognition of  the  many  consistencies
         and details within the interview record and material documents  had
         been overlooked, such as the tenancy agreement which bore  out  the
         contention that it was wrong to expect them to produce Council  Tax
         records given that this was  not  a  matter  for  which  they  were
         liable.

      6. The matter was then adjourned and the appeal came on for re-hearing
         before the Upper Tribunal, now constituted as a Panel, Judge Conway
         being joined by Judge Symes, on 8 July 2015.

      7. Further evidence was submitted by way of a Council Tax summary  for
         the Appellant and Ms Higgs at 12 [ -  ]  Grove  for  1  June  2015,
         confirmation of Ms Higgs appearing on the electoral  role  at  that
         address in May 2015, various copies of cards sent between  the  two
         commemorating special occasions including Valentine's Day, a letter
         from their landlord Islam Uddin confirming he was  responsible  for
         all bills, joint bank account statements for Appellant and  Sponsor
         at the 12 [ - ] Grove address, their  individual  driving  licences
         which each gave the same address.

      8. In his witness statement the Appellant set out that he and his wife
         remained very much in love and he did not feel it would be safe for
         her to live with him in Pakistan as a fair haired westerner.

      9. The Appellant gave evidence, saying that their rent  was  inclusive
         of  all  bills,  and  pointing  out  a  chain  of  documents  which
         identified his  landlord  and  their  participation  in  a  tenancy
         agreement which meant they were not liable  for  Council  Tax.  His
         wife adopted his witness statement. Neither was  challenged  as  to
         the genuine nature of the relationship.

     10. For the Respondent it was submitted that it was unusual for Council
         Tax to be included as part of the  rent  payable  under  a  Tenancy
         Agreement; that observation aside, Mr Tufan was content to rely  on
         the original refusal letter.

     11. For the Appellant it was submitted that the only question  relevant
         to the appeal was the credibility of the relationship, as  if  that
         was established the sole issue which divided the parties fell  away
         and there was no barrier to  the  grant  of  further  Discretionary
         Leave to Remain. There were bills provided in the  landlord's  name
         and ample  evidence  of  cohabitation,  and  the  interview  record
         included a litany of vivid answers that had the ring of truth.




    Findings and Reasons

     12. We have had the advantage of hearing oral evidence in this case  to
         supplement the written materials. There were lengthy interviews  in
         this case, the Sponsor being asked 442 questions and the  Appellant
         being  asked  277  questions.  The  British  citizen  sponsor   has
         consistently supported the appeal by attending hearings  to  answer
         questions. Whilst there  were  several  matters  which  caused  the
         Respondent concern, there were a great many other matters on  which
         the evidence was both detailed and consistent. On balance we  think
         that Mr Tufan was correct to  strike  a  pragmatic  stance  on  the
         appeal and to limit his case to  reliance  on  the  refusal  letter
         without seriously challenging the account by cross examination, and
         we accept that the relationship is genuine and subsisting, because:



         (a)      The matters said to be material discrepancies arising from
             the interview are in truth very minor in nature:  the  Sponsor
             gave a date for their wedding in 2010 that was merely one  day
             out, and generally the matters said to  involve  discrepancies
             between their accounts were not put to either interviewee;

         (b)      There is sometimes confusion as to  the  precise  question
             that was put,  for  example  the  interviewer  asked  them  to
             identify individuals  in  a  wedding  photograph  rather  than
             actually asking them to name the witnesses  to  the  marriage,
             contrary to the impression given in the refusal letter;

         (c)      Some of the questioning was unclear,  for  example  as  to
             whether a question involved access to savings in  their  joint
             account  or  their  individual  accounts,  meaning  that   the
             Appellant appeared to reference individual savings whereas the
             Sponsor referred to joint ones;

         (d)      We  do  not  think  it  would  be  safe  to  evaluate  the
             genuineness of a relationship based on  the  brand  of  mobile
             telephone that one believed the other to be presently using;

         (e)      There are numerous documents now before the Upper Tribunal
             which show that the parties are cohabiting,  and  the  concern
             entertained by the First-tier Tribunal as to  whether  or  not
             their tenancy arrangements included responsibility for Council
             Tax is now answered by documentary evidence.

     13. So we accept that the relationship is established on a  balance  of
         probabilities. Given the pragmatic and  helpful  agreement  between
         the advocates before us that this was the sole issue  that  divided
         them, we need to say very little more.

     14. The Respondent's guidance relating to cases  of  this  nature  sets
         out:

             "Transitional Arrangements

             All decisions made on Discretionary Leave on or after  9  July
             2012  will  be  subject  to  the  criteria  set  out  in  this
             guidance....

             Applicants granted Discretionary Leave before 9 July 2012

             Those who, before 9 July 2012, have been granted  leave  under
             the DL policy in force at the time will normally  continue  to
             be dealt with under that policy through to settlement if  they
             qualify for it (normally after  accruing  6  years  continuous
             DL). Further leave applications from those  granted  up  to  3
             years DL before 9 July 2012 are subject to an active review.

             Consideration  of  all  further  leave  applications  will  be
             subject to a criminality check  and  the  application  of  the
             criminality thresholds, including in respect of cases awaiting
             a decision on a  further  period  of  DL  on  that  date.  See
             Criminality and Exclusion section above.

             Decision  makers  must  consider  whether  the   circumstances
             prevailing at the time of the original grant of leave continue
             at the date of the decision. If the circumstances  remain  the
             same and the criminality thresholds do not  apply,  a  further
             period of 3 years DL  should  normally  be  granted.  Decision
             makers must consider whether there are any circumstances  that
             may warrant departure from the standard period of  leave.  See
             section 4.4 above."

     15. The Appellant, being a person who was previously granted  leave  to
         remain under this policy, has clearly had his case for an extension
         of leave pursuant to its terms assessed on the wrong factual basis.
         Properly assessed, given our acceptance  of  the  sole  issue  that
         troubled the Respondent, this is a case that fell within the  terms
         of the published policy: "the  circumstances  remain[ed]  the  same
         [and] a further period of 3 years DL should normally  be  granted."
         We accordingly find that the decision was not  in  accordance  with
         the law, the genuine nature of the relationship having been wrongly
         rejected, and that the Appellant's application remains  outstanding
         before the Respondent for lawful determination of the extension  of
         leave application.

    Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law which led to  its  decision  being
    set aside.

    We re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing the appeal. We do not
    make any fee award as our decision  is  based  significantly  on  post-
    decision evidence.
