                        DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 3 August 2015, of First-
       tier   Tribunal Judge Davey. Permission to appeal was granted by
       First Tier Tribunal Judge Kelly on 29 December 2015.




                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016


 Background

    2. The appellant sought a residence card as confirmation of a  right  to
       reside in the United Kingdom under the Immigration (European Economic
       Area) Regulations 2006, on the basis of his claimed dependency  on  a
       Polish national,  namely  Mrs  Randhawa,  who  is  the  wife  of  the
       appellant's uncle.

    3. The respondent, in refusing the said application, commented that  the
       appellant had not provided any evidence to support his claim that  he
       was dependent on Mrs Randhawa immediately  prior  to  coming  to  the
       United Kingdom.


    4. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  oral  evidence
       was given by Mrs Randhawa  as  well  as  the  appellant's  uncle,  Mr
       Randhawa. The judge concluded  that  the  evidence  was  that  of  Mr
       Randhawa alone providing financial support before the appellant  came
       to the United Kingdom. He accepted that the appellant had  been  able
       to demonstrate dependency from the end of 2010 or beginning of  2011,
       which is around when both he and his  uncle  arrived  in  the  United
       Kingdom.

    5. The grounds of application argue that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       made a mistake of fact in stating that there were no statements  from
       the appellant's uncle and sponsor. Secondly  it  was  said  that  the
       judge failed to  make  any  or  any  adequate  credibility  findings.
       Lastly, it was said that the judge  erred  in  that  he  ignored  the
       evidence of "various remittances sent to the appellant"  in  reaching
       his conclusion that there was no evidence of material  support  prior
       to the appellant entering the United Kingdom.

    6. Judge Kelly granted permission on the basis that it was arguable that
       Judge  Davey  provided  inadequate  reasons  for  finding  that   the
       appellant was not financially dependent upon his EEA sponsor prior to
       entering the United Kingdom. While Judge Kelly noted the lack  of  an
       appellant's bundle on the  IAC  case  file,  he  indicated  that  all
       grounds may be argued.

    7. The Secretary of State lodged a Rule 24 response on 5  January  2016,
       opposing the appellant's appeal. In addition, it was  suggested  that
       no statement appeared to have been provided by the appellant's  uncle
       or the  EEA  sponsor  and  that  the  grounds  appeared  to  be  mere
       disagreement with the findings.

    8. This matter was adjourned by the Upper Tribunal  at  the  appellant's
       request in advance of a hearing listed for 15 February  2016.  It  is
       apparent from the content of Addison & Khan Solicitors letter  of  10
       February 2016 that further time was needed in order to ascertain what
       evidence was before Judge Davey.








The hearing

    6. At the hearing before us, Mr Ranjha concentrated on the third ground.
       We indicated from the outset, that there  was  still  no  appellant's
       bundle on the case file. Albeit  there  was  a  loose  collection  of
       documents, none of which could be described as a remittance  receipt.
       He initially asserted that there was evidence of remittances sent  to
       the appellant before the judge and that  an  appellant's  bundle  had
       been sent to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance  with  directions.
       He showed us a bundle of documents sent under cover of a letter dated
       25 February 2016, which included a 22-page bundle, which he said  was
       "presumably" before the judge.

    7. Following further enquiry by the panel, Mr Ranjha  conceded  that  he
       could not be sure that the appellant's bundle was in front  of  Judge
       Davey and that he could refer us to no evidence to show that the said
       bundle was received by the First-tier Tribunal.  At  this  stage,  Ms
       Fijiwala indicated that no  evidence  from  the  appellant  had  been
       served on the respondent (who was not represented before  the  judge)
       at any stage. Ultimately, Mr Ranjha accepted that if the  appellant's
       bundle was not before Judge  Davey,  he  could  not  be  expected  to
       consider it.

    8. With regard to the first ground,  Mr  Ranjha  rightly  accepted  that
       there was no material error in relation to the judge's  comment  that
       there were no witness statements,  given  that  he  had  gone  on  to
       consider those witness statements in  [7]-[9]  of  the  decision  and
       reasons. Mr Ranha said nothing further regarding the alleged lack  of
       credibility findings.

    9. At the end of the hearing we reserved our decision.


Error of law

   10. We find there to be no material error of law  in  the  Judge  Davey's
       decision and therefore  dismiss  this  appeal.  Our  reasons  are  as
       follows.

   11. Taking the grounds in order, the judge may have been mistaken at  [7]
       of the decision and reasons in recording that there were  no  witness
       statements from the witnesses, however he immediately demonstrates in
       the  following  paragraphs  that  he  had  considered   the   witness
       statements  and  he  quotes  extensively  from  them.   Clearly,   as
       recognised by Mr Ranjha, any error is not material.

   12. With regard to the second ground,  which  was  not  developed  by  Mr
       Ranjha, it is obvious from reading the decision as a whole, that  the
       judge accepted the oral and written evidence of  the  witnesses.  The
       difficulty for the appellant was that the evidence of  his  witnesses
       was to the effect that he had been dependent on his  uncle  prior  to
       his arrival in the  United  Kingdom  and  not  on  the  EEA  sponsor.
       Furthermore, the judge provided detailed reasons from [7] to [17]  of
       the decision for concluding that the appellant was  not  an  extended
       family member under Regulation 8.






   13. Lastly, Mr Ranjha accepted that there was no evidence  to  show  that
       the appellant's bundle of evidence was  received  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal. Judge Davey cannot, therefore, be criticised for failing to
       consider evidence never before him.


      Conclusions

      The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

      We uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

      No application for anonymity was made and we saw  no  reason  to  make
    such a direction.

                This decision is the decision of us both.
