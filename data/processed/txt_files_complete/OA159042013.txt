For the Respondent:    Mr Clark - Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Mrs JS, a citizen of Thailand,  born  in  February
    1974.  She appeals under Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 against the decision of the Respondent made on 5th June
    2013 to refuse entry clearance as a partner under Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Appellant is married to PS, a British  citizen,
    born in February 1950.  They met in June 2012 and married  in  Thailand
    in February 2013.

 2. The Appellant's original appeal against the decision  of  the  ECO  was
    refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart following  a  hearing
    on 4th August 2014.  The Appellant sought permission  to  appeal  which
    was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly on  26th  January  2015.
    On 10th March 2015 having heard submissions I found that  there  was  a
    material error of law in the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal.
    I set that decision aside with no preserved findings of  fact.   I  now
    proceed to remake the decision.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) considered the application  in  terms
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  He noted that  the  Appellant
    had applied for a visit visa in 2004 and had made no application  since
    then, either from outside or within the UK.  She had admitted that  her
    intention when she came as a visitor was to seek employment in the  UK.
    She admitted that she had stayed in the UK for around  two  years  from
    2004 to 2006 and was employed without permission.  She left the UK only
    to  re-enter  in  2007  and  remained  here  without  permission  until
    September 2012.  The ECO said he was satisfied that  she  has  used  at
    least one false identity in order to enter the UK on two occasions.  He
    noted that she had sought non-emergency NHS treatment.   She  explained
    that whilst she was here between 2007 and 2012 she had  a  partner  who
    helped maintain her but soon after that relationship broke down she met
    her current Sponsor, PS, in June 2012.  He noted that she had never  at
    any time tried to regularise her immigration status.   Her  immigration
    history caused the ECO to doubt the genuineness of the marriage and  he
    expressed the view that she had used the  marriage  as  an  attempt  to
    regularise her status here.  He therefore refused the application under
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(c) of Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.   This
    states:

         'EC-P.1.1. The requirements to be met  for  entry  clearance  as  a
         partner are that-

             (a)  the applicant must be outside the UK;

             (b)  the applicant must have made a valid application for
             entry clearance as a partner;

             (c)  the applicant must not fall for refusal under any of the
             grounds in Section S-EC: Suitability-entry clearance; and

             (d)  the applicant must meet all of the requirements of
             Section E-ECP: Eligibility for entry clearance as a partner.'

    He went on to refuse it under S-EC  1.5.  Section  S-EC  sets  out  the
    suitability requirements and 1.5 states,

         'S-EC 1.5 The exclusion of the applicant from the UK is conducive
         to the public good because for example the applicant's conduct,
         (including convictions which do not fall within paragraph S-EC
         1.4), character, associations or other reasons make it undesirable
         to grant them entry clearance.'

 4. The ECO also refused the application because he was not satisfied  that
    the Appellant's relationship with the Sponsor is genuine or  subsisting
    or that they intend to live together permanently in  the  UK.   He  did
    find that the financial requirements of Appendix FM are met.

 5. The ECO then went on to dismiss the appeal under paragraph  320(11)  of
    the Immigration Rules which is under the heading:

         "Grounds on which entry clearance or  leave  to  enter  the  United
         Kingdom should normally be refused"

    Paragraph 11 states:

         "where the applicant has previously contrived in a significant  way
         to frustrate the intentions of the Rules by:

         (i)  overstaying; or

         (ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or

         (iii)    being an illegal entrant; or

         (iv) using deception in an application for entry  clearance,  leave
             to enter or remain or in order to obtain  documents  from  the
             Secretary of State or a third party required in support of the
             application (whether successful or not); and

             there are other aggravating circumstances, such as absconding,
             not meeting temporary admission/reporting restrictions or bail
             conditions, using an assumed identity or multiple  identities,
             switching nationality, making frivolous  applications  or  not
             complying with the re-documentation process."

 6. In the refusal letter the ECO gave a long list  of  factors  which  can
    amount to "aggravating circumstances" and highlighted the following:

          a) Previous working in breach of visitor conditions within  short
             time of arrival in the UK (indicating a  deliberate  intention
             to work).

          b) NHS care to which they are not entitled.

          c) Troublesome or frivolous applications.

          d) Taking part in a sham marriage or marriage of convenience.

 7. The decision was reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) on  30th
    June 2014 and upheld.  She noted that no Grounds  of  Appeal  had  been
    submitted with the appeal form.

 8.  Contrary to what was said by the ECM, Grounds of Appeal were submitted
    with the appeal form.  It  is  submitted  in  these  grounds  that  the
    decision is wrong.  It is submitted that discretion  should  have  been
    exercised in the Appellant's favour  under  paragraph  320(11)  as  the
    weight of the evidence is contrary to the decision.   It  is  submitted
    that the ECO has made a factual  error  in  his  consideration  of  the
    Appellant's access to NHS  medical  treatment.   She  only  sought  NHS
    treatment in relation to pregnancy and a miscarriage both of which  are
    classed as 'Immediately Necessary Treatment' and therefore available to
    anyone.  All other medical treatment  in  the  UK  was  received  on  a
    private basis.

 9. In her statement  provided  for  the  appeal  the  Appellant  said  the
    following.  Her family were poor.  She had two younger sisters and  two
    younger brothers.  One of her  brothers  was  killed  in  a  motorcycle
    accident at the age of 17.  At one time her mother left  her  with  her
    sister in the country while she went to  Bangkok  for  work.   She  was
    subjected to abuse by her aunt.  When her parents found out how unhappy
    she was they took her home.  She went to school quite a  distance  away
    and had to walk there.  She often had no food for lunch.  She had to do
    housework and look after her brothers and  sisters.   She  left  school
    when she was 16 because her parents could not  afford  the  fees.   She
    worked hard to study in the evening.  She gave birth to her first child
    when she was 17.  The father of the child never wanted anything  to  do
    with him and the Appellant continued to live with her parents.  She had
    her second child when she was 19.  The  father  of  that  child  wanted
    nothing to do with him.  She went back to work when the child was about
    3 months old and gave her son up to his father's parents who wanted  to
    look after him.   She  worked  as  a  quality  controller  for  various
    companies.  From 1993 to  1996  she  studied  part-time  and  gained  a
    Diploma in Marketing Management and from 1995  to  2004  worked  for  a
    German lens factory in Bangkok as a training officer in the  Sales  and
    Telemarketing  Department  and  as   Assistant   General   Manager   of
    Production, Planning and Quality Control.  She obtained a mortgage  and
    bought a little house in a suburb of Bangkok.  In 2004 the family  home
    was repossessed because her father was unable to pay the mortgage.  The
    family were all homeless.  She helped  her  father  become  a  Buddhist
    Monk.  She got some money from a savings and insurance  scheme  run  by
    her employer and some from her aunt and bought a small  piece  of  land
    and started to build a house for her family.  She worked very  hard  to
    help them.  They were so poor that they had to partly  depend  on  food
    from the monks at the local Temple.

10. She had previously applied for a visa with a group of people  to  visit
    the UK for a dance demonstration at  the  Temple  but  the  visas  were
    refused.  She then met someone in Thailand who told her that  he  could
    arrange for her to travel to the UK.  She finds it  difficult  to  talk
    about this and about her time in the UK as it  is  very  painful.   She
    told the Sponsor and he wrote about it in his statement.  She  returned
    to Thailand in late 2006 and then returned to the UK in 2007 as she was
    desperate to see her boyfriend  there.   She  just  turned  up  on  his
    doorstep.  She was very stupid.  She regrets this.  She broke  up  with
    him in 2012 and decided to return to Thailand.  She was  unhappy  being
    in the UK illegally and wanted to see her sons and her family.  She was
    thinking of becoming a Buddhist nun.  She then however met PS  in  June
    2012.  They met at the British Museum.  They started chatting then went
    for a coffee.  She describes the outings they had.  She was  a  regular
    visitor at a Buddhist Temple in Wimbledon where she  studied  and  took
    exams in Buddhism.  There are certificates confirming this.   She  took
    the Sponsor there to meet the monks and other members of the community.
     When she met him she was already planning to return  to  Thailand  but
    soon after she knew that she and the Sponsor had fallen in  love.   The
    Sponsor asked her to marry him.  She did not marry him to get his money
    or to get a visa.  She wanted someone to love and who would  love  her.
    She had always been hurt by men in the past.  There was  an  engagement
    ceremony at the Buddhist Temple in Wimbledon following their engagement
    in September 2012.  She returned to Thailand  on  4th  September  2012.
    The Sponsor flew to Thailand on 24th October 2012, was  introduced  to
    her family and stayed for four weeks.  He returned to the  UK  on  21st
    November 2012 then to Thailand on 5th  January  2013  where  he  stayed
    until April.  They married in February 2013 and had a Buddhist ceremony
    in March.

11. She goes on to say that the marriage is not sham or one of convenience.
     They have been living together as a married couple for over two  years
    and will continue to live together permanently as they love each other.
     She describes their lives together.   Her  sons  are  happy  with  her
    husband.  She and the Sponsor are always in contact.  If  the  ECO  had
    asked for more evidence of contact they could have provided it.  She is
    sorry for what she did when she first came to the UK but she  did  what
    she did only because she had to provide for  her  family  in  Thailand.
    She did not use any assumed identities after she  arrived  in  the  UK.
    She always used her own name.  Her official records  were  in  her  own
    name such as the NHS, council tax etc.  She only saw a GP  because  she
    was pregnant.  She was never asked to pay for her treatment  but  would
    have done so if asked.  She did pay for some treatment.

12. I have a statement from the Sponsor.  He begins by apologising for  the
    length of it, speaking of the stress that he and  his  wife  have  been
    under since the application was refused.  He  has  elaborated  on  some
    factors relative to his wife's life because it was difficult  for  her.
    He was a GP for 30 years and retired in September 2012.   He  describes
    how he met and married the Appellant.

13. He then responds to the allegations of the  existence  of  "aggravating
    circumstances".  The ECO had relied on the fact that the Appellant "had
    entered into a relationship with a UK national shortly after a previous
    relationship broke down".  The Sponsor said this is  perfectly  normal.
    She had been in an abusive relationship which she had broken off.   She
    was looking for a loving relationship.  She had suffered violence.  Her
    ex-boyfriend was using drugs.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  also
    relied on the fact that she had  "entered  into  the  marriage  shortly
    afterwards".  The Sponsor points out that  it  was  seven  and  a  half
    months after they met that they married.  There are  social  taboos  in
    Thailand about unmarried couples living together.  That had to be taken
    into account.  He was the one who raised the topic of marriage not her.
     She returned to Thailand voluntarily  which  demonstrates  a  wish  to
    regularise her immigration status and do everything properly.  He  goes
    through all the evidence that  he  submitted  to  the  ECO  of  contact
    between them, submitting that this was adequate to show that they  were
    together  and  maintaining  very  regular  contact.   In  addition  the
    covering letter from their solicitor explicitly offered to provide more
    evidence if required but none was requested and they were  not  invited
    for interview.

14. They have lived together as a couple in  Thailand  since  24th  October
    2012 apart from periods when he had to return to the UK to prepare  for
    and attend court hearings relative to an application for a variation in
    the maintenance paid  to  his  ex-wife.   Since  October  2012  he  has
    travelled to Thailand no fewer than six times to live  with  his  wife.
    He gives the dates.  He then lists factors which confirm his commitment
    to the relationship, such as financial contributions to  her  home  and
    pursuing the appeal which has been a stressful and  expensive  process.
    They have a joint account in Thailand.  They plan to purchase  a  house
    together and have made offers  on  three  different  houses  and  three
    pieces of land since January 2014.  They hope to start building a house
    soon.  He is convinced that the  Appellant  entered  the  marriage  for
    reasons of love and that her intentions are true and honest.  He  is  a
    mature GP with over 30 years' experience in reading body  language  and
    non-verbal communication and he  has  never  seen  any  sign  that  the
    Appellant's affection for him is not absolutely real and sincere.

15. With regard to the allegation that she was working in breach of visitor
    conditions within a short period of her arrival in the UK, he said that
    she was not able to work as she was being held prisoner as a victim  of
    trafficking.  Following this  she  was  supported  financially  by  her
    boyfriend.  She did not use multiple false identities.  The  allegation
    that  she  abused  NHS  care  shows  a  misunderstanding  of  the   NHS
    Regulations.   She  never  said  that  she  sought  non-emergency   NHS
    treatment.  She gave no  such  explanation  and  none  appears  on  her
    solicitor's representations.  The  ECO  did  not  have  access  to  her
    medical records.  The Visa Application Form asks only  "Have  you  ever
    received medical treatment in the UK" to which she answered "yes".  She
    did not come to the UK with the intention of seeking medical  treatment
    and neither was it non-emergency treatment.  The Department  of  Health
    Guidance says that GPs  have  a  discretion  to  register  undocumented
    migrants and at the time the Appellant consulted  a  GP  she  was  nine
    weeks pregnant.  The guidance is that pregnant women can  be  asked  to
    pay for their care and maternity care is  "immediately  necessary"  and
    must not be withheld because a woman  is  unable  to  pay  in  advance.
    Maternity care includes antenatal care, birth and postnatal  care.   He
    gives a list of the various treatments she received  from  her  doctor.
    These amount to six consultations.  Apart from a routine cervical smear
    and a subsequent bleeding problem she attended  for  a  twisted  ankle,
    swollen lymph glands, a fever and a throat infection for which she  was
    prescribed antibiotics.  She was not asked to  pay  for  any  of  these
    treatments.

16. With regard to the allegation that she has now made a  "troublesome  or
    frivolous application" he submits that is this ridiculous.   They  took
    legal  advice  and  were  told  that  she  should  return  to  Thailand
    voluntarily at her own expense and make an application and that is what
    she did.  He then gives examples of evidence of her good character.

17. He says that it would unreasonable to expect him to live permanently in
    Thailand.  He plans to spend about three months of  each  winter  there
    but the rest of the time in England because he has a son here and an ex-
    wife who has severe bipolar disorder and is on  long  term  medication.
    He does not feel able to rely on her as a back-up carer for her son who
    now lives with him.  He  gives  other  reasons  why  he  cannot  remain
    permanently in Thailand, including the fact that he does not speak Thai
    and is finding it difficult to learn; he feels truly at home in England
    and loves the countryside and the culture; he  has  a  flat  in  London
    which is let and he has to manage; he  has  close  family  with  health
    problems.

18. The Sponsor in his statement deals with the Appellant's claim  to  have
    been trafficked to the  UK.   He  states  that  she  was  a  victim  of
    trafficking for sex on her  first  visit  to  the  UK  which  may  have
    resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   He  believes  this
    explains why she came to the UK a  second  time.   Her  previous  legal
    representative advised her against referring to the trafficking in  her
    statement.  He says that this is not a fabrication designed to gain the
    sympathy of the court as the Appellant did not want it to  be  included
    in her final statement.  She told him very reluctantly about it in  May
    2013 while in a very distressed state.  She was kept locked in a house,
    her passport was taken from her and when she was taken from  the  house
    in a car she was hidden under a  blanket.   She  was  released  when  a
    client  paid  her  traffickers  what  she  owed  them.   This  sum  was
    apparently �12,000.  He tried to get more details from his wife but she
    refused to speak about it.  She was interviewed on the  phone  on  15th
    June 2013 by a highly experienced interviewer who gave the opinion that
    she was a victim of trafficking.  She is clearly still  traumatised  by
    her experience and told him that she had attempted suicide twice in the
    past ten years, once in the UK and once in Bangkok.

19. He points out  that  in  the  refusal  letter  his  assets  were  given
    incorrectly as �1,300,000.  They are in fact around �700,000 as the ECO
    failed to deduct his liabilities.  He says he is not a millionaire  who
    can throw away money on legal fees and a sham wife.

20.  I have a very large bundle of documents,  including  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor's travel to and from  Thailand  and  hotel  bookings.   I  have
    extracts from his personal diary.   I  have  a  very  large  bundle  of
    records of Skype calls between  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor.   I  have
    confirmation of  the  relationship  from  the  Appellant's  sister  and
    brother-in-law.

21. With regard to the Appellant's use of medical services whilst in the UK
    I  have  her  patient  records  and  correspondence  relating  to   her
    registration with a GP.  These records show that she presented  at  the
    GP during her pregnancy and antenatal care was planned.  A  miscarriage
    is recorded.  Essentially she had some common investigative  tests  and
    was prescribed antibiotics. There is evidence of dental  treatment  for
    which she paid.

22.  I have some evidence  of  the  Appellant's  education  and  career  in
    Thailand.

23. The Appellant and Sponsor signed a prenuptial agreement which I mention
    because it has in the past been referred to by both the Respondent  and
    the Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal, the  implication  being  that  it
    supports the contention of the Respondent that  the  Appellant  married
    the Sponsor for financial gain.  I  have  read  the  agreement  in  its
    entirety.  It  notes  that  the  Sponsor  was  previously  married  and
    divorced in 2004 and that he has one son born in 1993 but the Appellant
    has never been married and has two children born in 1990 and 1991.  The
    agreement was signed on 23rd January 2013.  Apart from a dowry paid  to
    the Appellant's family in the sum of 550,000 THB (around �10,000) I can
    see little benefit to the Appellant in the event of a breakdown of  the
    marriage. The agreement provides  that   each  party  would  separately
    retain all of his or her rights to his or her separate property  listed
    in an annex to the agreement and including in the case of PS two  homes
    in the UK worth a total of around �950,000 and a flat in  London  worth
    around �272,000.  This list also includes his NHS pension and a private
    pension, his money in the bank and his car.  The Appellant's assets are
    said to be two houses and land in Thailand worth around  1,800,000  THB
    and a car.  Each will be responsible for his  or  own  liabilities.  On
    divorce the parties will have no  right  against  each  other  for  the
    division of separate property existing before the date of the agreement
    and during the marriage.

24. I heard oral evidence from the Sponsor who adopted his  statement.   He
    said they have now bought a house in  Thailand  together.   He  let  us
    listen to some recordings of his Skype conversations with his wife.

25. In cross-examination Mr Clark pointed out  to  him  that  his  original
    statements from May 2013 do not mention the trafficking.  He asked  him
    if he knew about it at  that  time.   The  Sponsor  said  that  it  was
    discussed with the solicitors but it was not  put  into  the  statement
    because his wife was reluctant to talk about it.   There  was  domestic
    violence at the hands of her boyfriend which was nothing to do with the
    trafficking.   The  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had   wrongly
    conflated the domestic violence and the trafficking.  He said  that  he
    thinks that when the Appellant came to the UK the first  time  she  did
    not know she was being trafficked.  She thought she was coming to work.
     He said he had to drag it from her.  She just closes up if he tries to
    mention it.  Mr Clark put it to him  that  she  had  previously  tried
    everything to remain in the UK so how did he know that she was not just
    using him.  He said their relationship was not too quick.  She  had  in
    fact had two proposals from  other  men  and  had  refused.   They  got
    married seven months after they met.  She was going  back  to  Thailand
    anyway.  She is not desperate to come here.  She would  happily  remain
    in Thailand but he has a life here.

26. I asked him if he was sure that her love for him was genuine.  He  said
    he knows she loves him.  They have lived together for  two  years.   He
    has been having tests for bowel cancer in the UK.  He has  family  here
    and loves it here.  He went through a painful divorce.   He  is  not  a
    stupid man.

27. In his submissions Mr Clark said he  would  rely  on  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter.  He said  the  suitability  requirements  contained  in
    Appendix FM are not met. The  provisions  at  para  1.1  are  mandatory
    reasons and 2.1 sets out  reasons  for  which  entry  clearance  should
    normally be refused.  This is a mandatory refusal.  The Appellant  said
    she was trafficked but in 2004  her  intention  was  to  enter  the  UK
    illegally.  She came for economic reasons.  She was working  illegally.
    That is a serious crime.  He said  I  have  to  look  at  the  previous
    deceptions in the round.  She was prepared to defraud the  authorities.
    Again he relied on the speed of the marriage.

28. With regard to Article 8 Section 117B has to be applied.  He relied  on
    the decision AM  (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) and on  Nagre  R
    (on the application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin),  paragraphs 39 to 41.

29. Mr Symes provided a skeleton argument in which it is submitted that the
    marriage has clearly been established as genuine. The Appellant  is  of
    good character. She was a  victim  of  trafficking.  There  is  nothing
    unusual in the history of their relationship.

30. In oral submissions Mr Symes said that the Sponsor  is  a  man  of  the
    highest integrity.  He is used  to  evaluating  people  and  should  be
    considered to be a reliable judge of the Appellant's intentions.   With
    regard to the suitability reasons it is a mandatory refusal but  it  is
    predicated on  a  judgment  call.   There  is  a  credible  alternative
    narrative in this case i.e.  that  the  Appellant  was  trafficked  and
    abused.  She did go back home.  There is a history of forced labour and
    abuse.  She suffered domestic violence.  With regard to Section 320(11)
    he referred me to the case law and said that nothing that was relied on
    by the Respondent would amount to aggravation.

My findings

31. In this case the burden of proof is on the Appellant and  the  standard
    of proof is on the balance of probabilities.

32. There is no doubt that  the  Appellant  spent  some  years  in  the  UK
    unlawfully and that she did enter unlawfully twice. The Entry Clearance
    Officer has refused the application  for entry clearance under Appendix
    FM - on the grounds that the marriage is not genuine and subsisting and
    on suitability grounds - and under  para  320(11)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Both 320(11) and the suitability  requirements  in  Appendix  FM
    refer to 'aggravating circumstances'.  The specific grounds relied upon
    by the Respondent are set out at paragraph 6 above. I shall  deal  with
    these one by one.

           . Working illegally - there is no evidence that  she  did   this
             but the Respondent said that she admitted having done  so  and
             she had to support her family in Thailand so I accept that she
             may have worked in the UK without permission.

           . benefitting from NHS care to which she was not entitled - I do
             not accept that she did this. Indeed I think that this  aspect
             of the complaint against her has been not only  misinterpreted
             but exaggerated.  It is well known that  many  people  without
             leave to be in  the  UK  receive  NHS  treatment  because  NHS
             doctors accept them as patients with few or no questions being
             asked. That is the reality of the situation. In  any  event  I
             accept that the Appellant initially sought care when  she  was
             pregnant. She was entitled to this. She was  never  asked  for
             payment. If she had been asked I accept that  she  would  have
             paid.

           .  Making a troublesome or frivolous application - the  view  of
             PS was that this is a ridiculous accusation. It  seems  to  me
             that an application  can  only  be  described  troublesome  or
             frivolous if it is without merit. If there  is  merit  in  the
             application it is neither troublesome nor  frivolous.  If  the
             marriage is genuine this cannot in this case be a  ground  for
             refusal under paragraph 320(11).

           . Taking part in a sham marriage or marriage  of  convenience  -
             again if the marriage is genuine this ground holds  no  weight
             relative to 320(11) and 'aggravating circumstances.

33. There was also an allegation that the Appellant used fake identities in
    her everyday life in the UK. I do not accept that as true. She came  to
    the UK with the aid of an agent so it would not be  surprising  if  she
    had false documents provided by him to enable  entry  to  the  UK.  She
    would have done as she was told by him.  I do not condone that  but  it
    is a far cry from using a false ID in the UK to access services here. I
    do not accept that she did that and no evidence that she did  has  been
    produced.

34.  I accept that there was at the date of the  decision  no  satisfactory
    evidence that the Appellant had been trafficked but  that  more  recent
    evidence from her and her husband gives rise to  a  strong  possibility
    that she was.

35. With regard to the marriage, at the date of decision the Appellant  and
    sponsor were married and a large bundle of evidence was submitted  with
    the application. There was a statement from the Sponsor  and  one  from
    the  Appellant  detailing  how  they  met  and  the  history  of  their
    relationship.  The Sponsor was clear that it was he  who  had  proposed
    marriage. He made it clear that he has  considerable  ties  to  the  UK
    including a son.  He is correct in  saying  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer took no account of his liabilities in assessing his  worth  and
    it seems to me that he really did not  properly  read  the  pre-nuptial
    agreement. He had a print out of SKYPE calls which I accept is  limited
    evidence of contact but it is evidence and he did  have  evidence  that
    the Sponsor had spent a lot of time in Thailand.  He  appears  to  have
    given no weight to the fact that the Appellant had returned to Thailand
    several months before the wedding, shortly after their  engagement  and
    that by the date of decision the Sponsor had spent around 4  months  in
    Thailand with the Appellant.

36. Having considered all the evidence I am satisfied that the marriage  is
    genuine.  It is of course difficult to make a  finding  in  such  cases
    because the intentions of both parties have to be taken  into  account.
    There is no doubt about  the  feelings  of  the  Sponsor.   I  had  the
    opportunity of speaking with him twice, at the two hearings before  me,
    and I am satisfied that he genuinely cares for the Appellant  and  that
    there are no  circumstances  under  which  he  would  knowingly  become
    involved in any sort of plan  for  her  to  gain  entry  unlawfully  or
    deceitfully to the UK.  I have not of course met the Appellant  who  is
    in Thailand and unable  to  give  evidence  in  her  own  appeal.   The
    relationship has however lasted  some  time.   Much  was  made  in  the
    previous determination, which I set aside, of the prenuptial  agreement
    but it does not seem to me that it  contains  anything  that  would  be
    prejudicial to PS or give the Appellant cause to marry the Sponsor  for
    potential financial gain.  I make nothing of the fact that they met and
    married within seven months.  As PS says, they are a mature couple.  No
    account was taken of the fact that the Appellant returned  to  Thailand
    to wed and to make her application for entry clearance. No  weight  was
    given to the ties the Sponsor clearly has in the UK or to the amount of
    time he had spent in Thailand.

37. The decision of the Respondent under Appendix FM  was  reliant  on  his
    view that the Appellant' conduct, character  and  association  make  it
    undesirable that she be granted entry clearance. I  have  rejected  the
    findings that she abused the NHS and that she adopted a false identity.
    I have accepted that she would have entered on  a  false  passport  but
    that was at the instance of an agent and does not in my view warrant  a
    ban on entry. I have given the Respondent the benefit of the doubt  and
    accepted the possibility that the Appellant worked in  the  UK  without
    permission but there is no indication that she ever  relied  on  public
    funds and again I do not accept  that  working  without  permission  of
    itself warrants a refusal of entry clearance. She did of course  remain
    here illegally but if it were the case that she was trafficked and  was
    forced to work in the sex trade to pay off debt due to  the  agent  she
    would have had no choice but to remain in the UK. (I accept  that  this
    information was  not  before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  when  the
    decision was made).  The Entry Clearance Officer appears to have  given
    no weight to the fact that she did at one point  go  back  to  Thailand
    only to return to the UK to resume an abusive relationship. It is clear
    that the Entry Clearance Officer failed to properly assess in the round
    the evidence before him and indeed that some of it was  misinterpreted.
    It seems to me that a very negative interpretation was given to all the
    elements of the evidence and any positive elements ignored. I find that
    the refusal under para S-EC 1.5 was not in accordance with the law.

38. I turn now to paragraph 320(11) and the question of whether  there  are
    aggravating circumstances in this case. I have  dealt  above  with  the
    points relied on by the Respondent.

39. In PS (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed) India [2010] UKUT 440
    (IAC) the Tribunal said in the headnote,

         'In exercising discretion under paragraph 320(11)  of  HC  395,  as
         amended, to refuse an application for entry  clearance  in  a  case
         where the automatic prohibition on the grant of entry clearance  in
         paragraph 320(7B) is disapplied by paragraph 320(7C), the  decision
         maker must  exercise  great  care  in  assessing  the  'aggravating
         circumstances' said to justify refusal and must have regard to  the
         public interest in  encouraging  those  unlawfully  in  the  United
         Kingdom to  leave  and  seek  to  regularise  their  status  by  an
         application for entry clearance.'

40. They also said ,

         'It is therefore wholly unclear whether the Entry Clearance Officer
         has addressed his mind to the relevant question, namely whether  in
         the circumstances of this case Mr S's breach of UK immigration  law
         was sufficiently aggravating so as  to  justify  the  refusal.   It
         seems  to  us  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   should   have
         specifically recognised that Mr S had voluntarily left  the  United
         Kingdom more than 12 months ago with a  view  to  regularising  his
         immigration status.  There was no question but  that  the  marriage
         was a genuine one.  If the aggravating circumstances are not  truly
         aggravating there is in this context a serious risk that  those  in
         the position of Mr S will simply continue to remain in  the  United
         Kingdom unlawfully and will not seek to regularise their status  as
         he has sought to do.  The effect then  is  likely  to  be  counter-
         productive to the general purposes of the relevant rules and to the
         maintenance of a  coherent  system  of  immigration.   However,  as
         explained, the Entry Clearance Officer in this case did not address
         the correct question and did not carry out  an  adequate  balancing
         exercise under the guidelines.  Furthermore, Mr S had made a  claim
         under Article 8 which, standing  alone,  may  not  have  been  very
         strong.   Nonetheless  the  family  circumstances  needed   to   be
         evaluated carefully in the balancing  exercise  to  which  we  have
         referred.'

41. It is clear that the question of whether an applicant has left  the  UK
    to make an application from her home country is a relevant one  yet  it
    seems that no weight was given to that.   As  with  para  S-EC  1.5  of
    Appendix FM what we are left with is the issue  of  employment  without
    permission, use of a false passport to enter the country and  remaining
    here without leave. There is a very long list of possible  'aggravating
    circumstances' and I do not think, looking at all the evidence  in  the
    round and taking account of the fact that the Appellant is in a genuine
    relationship and  returned  to  Thailand  to  marry  and  to  make  her
    application for entry clearance, that it can be said that  these  three
    connected factors can be said to amount to  'aggravating  circumstances
    in terms of paragraph 320 (11).

42. I find that the refusal of entry clearance under paragraph 320 (11) was
    not in accordance with the law.
