For the Appellant:     Mr W Rees (counsel instructed by Farani Taylor
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of SM, a citizen of Pakistan born 10 January 1985,
       against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  12  October  2018
       dismissing  her  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the  Respondent's
       refusal of his asylum claim of 25 May 2018.

    2. The Appellant arrived in the UK in June 2011, having been  granted  a
       visa as a Tier 4 student; she was granted leave  to  enter  until  13
       December 2013. She returned to Pakistan from 4 to 11 March  2012  and
       from 15 to 23 March 2013. She applied for further student leave on 26
       December 2013, that application being refused  on  4  May  2015.  She
       claimed asylum on 24 November 2017.

    3. Her asylum claim was  based  on  this  essential  history,  which  is
       abbreviated and based on that provided by the First-tier Tribunal, as
       the full detail of her  claim  is  not  relevant  at  this  stage  of
       proceedings. She had met a man, Mr I, whilst studying at  college  in
       Pakistan.  Although  he  was  already  married,  they   developed   a
       relationship in secret. They secretly married in February  2011.  She
       was subsequently threatened by his family. She reported this  to  the
       police who refused to acknowledge her complaint. She  then  took  the
       opportunity to come to the UK to study.

    4. In 2011 she began living with her friend [NG] in London in  a  shared
       house. Soon after her arrival here, Mr I's brother was  convicted  of
       murder. Subsequently her family in Pakistan received  divorce  papers
       for the Appellant, thus learning for the first time of  her  marriage
       to Mr I; thereafter her relationship with her family broke  down  and
       they had nothing more to do with one another.

    5. [NG] became pregnant in 2012 and moved out of their London home. On 4
       March 2012 the Appellant returned to Pakistan, and met up with Mr  I;
       he told her that he was divorcing her due to pressure from his  wife.
       They prepared the relevant paperwork  together,  and  he  signed  it.
       However, before her return to the UK, he then told her that he  would
       withdraw the divorce. Although she had returned to Pakistan  on  this
       occasion  without  telling  anyone,  Mr   I's   family   nevertheless
       discovered  her  presence  there,   and   subsequently   abused   the
       Appellant's own family.

    6. Following the Appellant's return  to  the  UK  the  same  month,  she
       learned that Mr I had resumed divorce proceedings, which he  had  now
       served on her family. She sought to persuade Mr I  not  to  go  ahead
       with the divorce proceedings when she returned to Pakistan  in  2013,
       during which time they stayed together at a rented house, but one  of
       Mr I's brothers learned of her presence there and warned her off. She
       had had no further contact with Mr I subsequently.

    7. In early 2017 the Appellant encountered [NG] and her son  in  London,
       and learned of [NG]'s problems in her own relationship with the boy's
       father. In July 2017 they became increasingly  friendly  and  in  due
       course developed intimate feelings for  one  another;  the  Appellant
       subsequently came to identify herself as a Lesbian.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal considered the evidence before it,  which  it
       described as including witness statements from two of the Appellant's
       friend's,  [O]  and  [E];  it  also  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
       Appellant's alleged partner, [NG], and from another friend,  [T].  It
       noted the evidence from [NG] stating that she  had  reconnected  with
       the Appellant in 2017; they had both been betrayed by men  which  had
       led them to become inseparably close, and one day they began kissing.
       She believed the Appellant to be "a hundred percent" homosexual.

    9.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  concluded  that  the  evidence   of   the
       Appellant's sexuality and concluded her claim to be lesbian  was  not
       credible because:

        a) The Appellant stated her physical relationship with  [NG]  began
           on Boxing Day in oral evidence, but in June 2017 in her  witness
           statement;

        b) The Appellant's evidence as to her activities with [NG] the  day
           before the hearing was that she had not accompanied [NG] on  her
           appointment with a doctor, as she spent the  day  preparing  for
           the asylum appeal; whereas [NG] stated they spent the whole  day
           together;

        c) The Appellant stated they had not spent a night together for two
           weeks, whereas [NG] stated they had spent the  previous  weekend
           together;

        d) [T] stated that she had last seen the Appellant three weeks ago,
           whereas the Appellant said that she had seen  her  the  previous
           Saturday; the Appellant stated [T] lived in Soho  whereas  [T]'s
           own evidence was that she lived in Lewisham.

       I have corrected the various errors made in the decision appealed  as
       to names and genders to avoid further confusion.

   10. Having rejected the Appellant's claim in this  regard,  the  Tribunal
       dismissed the appeal, on the basis that, her claim to be  gay  having
       been rejected, she would not be  at  any  risk  of  serious  harm  in
       Pakistan.

   11. Grounds of appeal challenged this decision, on the basis that

        a) No reference was made to the principles set out in HJ (Iran) and
           there was no finding on whether the Appellant would be perceived
           as Lesbian in Pakistan;

        b)  Significant  errors  of  fact  undermined  confidence  in   the
           decision: the Appellant's gender was mis-stated as was her  name
           on the first page, elsewhere the witness [T]  was  ascribed  the
           male gender,  and  the  representatives  before  the  First-tier
           Tribunal were not identified;

        c) There was a  significant  delay  between  the  hearing  and  the
           promulgation  of  the  decision,  which  was  relevant  to   the
           assessment of credibility, notwithstanding that the Tribunal had
           correctly identified the existence of certain  discrepancies  in
           the evidence;

        d) All this cast doubt as to whether the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
           had access to a reliable record of proceedings when it wrote its
           decision,  particularly  given  it   had   not   addressed   the
           Appellant's advocates submissions below that her  oral  evidence
           appeared to be affected by nerves;

        e) The Tribunal had failed to consider the  country  evidence  when
           assessing the Appellant's gender preference;

        f) Furthermore, the Tribunal had  not  addressed  the  threats  the
           Appellant asserted having received from Mr I's brother;

        g) There was no decision made vis-ï¿½-vis the private life  dimension
           of the Appellant's  claim,  including  whether  she  faced  very
           significant obstacles to integration in Pakistan given she would
           be returning as a lone woman.

   12. Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  12
       November 2018 on all grounds.

   13. Mr Rees relied on the grounds  of  appeal.  Mr  Walker  pragmatically
       accepted that it was difficult to counter the submission  that  there
       were significant flaws in the reasoning of the  First-tier  Tribunal.
       In particular, he drew attention to the extent of the factual  errors
       as to names and genders  of  relevant  individuals,  the  failure  to
       record the oral evidence of two witnesses, and the unexplained  three
       month delay in issuing a decision predicated wholly  on  credibility.
       Furthermore there was no  reference  whatsoever  in  the  credibility
       findings to the background to the Appellant's asylum claim by way  of
       events said to have taken place in Pakistan.

  Findings and reasons

   14. I consider Mr Walker was right to take the stance that  he  did.  The
       flaws that he identified are very significant ones.

   15. There is no absolute rule that a three month delay in determining  an
       appeal on credibility grounds is necessarily unlawful. The matter has
       been discussed several  times  over  the  years  in  the  context  of
       immigration appeals, most recently in SS (Sri Lanka) [2018] EWCA  Civ
       1391, which explains that excessive delay  in  making  a  credibility
       decision is not itself a reason for setting  a  decision  aside.  The
       correct approach is to ask whether the delay has caused the  decision
       to be unsafe such that it would be unjust to let it  stand.  A  three
       month delay  required  the  factual  findings  to  be  examined  with
       particular care, but there was no rebuttable presumption in favour of
       remittance in Tribunal proceedings, and the earlier Court  of  Appeal
       authority of Sambisavam did not intend to identify a binding of  rule
       of law to such effect.

   16. Equally, the Upper Tribunal will  not  set  aside  a  perfectly  well
       reasoned First-tier Tribunal decision simply because of  infelicities
       of expression, typographical errors or minor mistakes  of  fact.  Its
       jurisdiction is generally limited to the detection of true errors  of
       law.

   17. However, notwithstanding these considerations, it seems  to  me  that
       the credibility findings in this particular decision are vitiated  by
       the combination of delay and factual  error.  I  am  concerned  that,
       particularly in the context  of  an  asylum  claim  based  on  gender
       preference, and given the relatively short reasons given for  finding
       the Appellant to lack credibility, that significant details  such  as
       the gender of witnesses and the spelling of her partner's  name  were
       expressed wrongly. Furthermore, the fact that two witnesses gave oral
       (not merely witness statement) evidence  is  not  apparent  from  the
       decision at all.

   18. Furthermore, there are other real concerns with the assessment of the
       evidence. The Appellant and [NG] had both given evidence  that  their
       relationship sprung partly from  their  adverse  experiences  at  the
       hands of their former partners. Yet there is  no  assessment  of  the
       extensive evidence that the Appellant gave regarding her relationship
       with Mr I whatsoever. Indeed, there  was  no  acknowledgment  in  the
       reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal  of  her  asserted  difficulties
       with Mr I's family.

   19. For these reasons, I consider that the decision cannot stand. As  the
       credibility findings are central to the determination of  the  issues
       on the appeal, this requires a full re-hearing of all relevant issues
       before the First-tier Tribunal. For the assistance of a future  Judge
       hearing the appeal, the salient issues (the relevance of  each  being
       dependent on the First-tier Tribunal's  future  fact  finding)  would
       appear to be:

        a) The Appellant's alleged fear  of  persecution  on  a  return  to
           Pakistan due to her gender preference as it has developed in the
           UK;

        b) Any alleged fear of persecution/serious harm that may arise from
           the relatives of her former partner, Mr I;

        c)  The  Appellant's  private  life  in  the  sense  recognised  by
           Immigration Rule 276ADE(vi) which posits  the  question  whether
           she faces very significant obstacles to integration in Pakistan,
           having regard to the possibility that she would be a lone  woman
           on a return to Pakistan;

        d) The Appellant's Article 8 rights more broadly outside the Rules,
           i.e. whether she has a compelling case that the strength of  her
           UK ties, including any durable same-sex relationship she may  be
           accepted as being party to in the UK,  amounts  to  private  and
           family  life  with  which  her   removal   would   represent   a
           disproportionate interference.

Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for re-hearing afresh.





ANONYMITY ORDER

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
