                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Gulvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Iraq Anisuddin, Legal Representative,
      Immigration Counselling Centre



 1. The Secretary of State appeals with leave against the determination  of
    an Adjudicator Dr S S Juss, promulgated  23  January  2003  wherein  he
    allowed an appeal on human rights grounds against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State who had refused an application made under  paragraph
    284 of HC 395 for the Claimant to join a British  spouse.   The  appeal
    was approved on Article 8 human rights grounds.



The Adjudicator determination

 2. The Adjudicator heard evidence from the  Appellant  and  his  wife  Mrs
    Kuldeep Kaur Kalsi.  The Claimant was represented but the Secretary  of
    State was not.

 3. The Adjudicator established that the Claimant had arrived in the United
    Kingdom in December 1992 and had requested asylum.  His application was
    considered and refused on  16  September  1993.   An  appeal  was  also
    dismissed.   A  new  passport  was  obtained  for  the  Appellant   and
    arrangements made for  his  return  to  India  on  19  May  1994.   The
    Appellant failed to embark and was circulated as an absconder.  Nothing
    further was heard of him until June 2000 when he  made  an  application
    for leave to remain on the basis of his marriage to  Mrs  Kalsi.   That
    marriage had taken place in May 2000  subsequent  upon  a  relationship
    which commenced in 1996.   The  application  on  marriage  grounds  was
    refused  on  29  March  2001  and  an  appeal  was  then  made  to  the
    Adjudicator.  It was not  disputed  that  the  marriage  itself  was  a
    genuine one.  It is also evident that the couple had a child in 2001.

 4. The Adjudicator recognised that the onus was on the  Claimant  to  show
    whether there were obstacles to establishing family life in  India  and
    that the obstacles  did  exist.   The  Adjudicator  rightly  noted  the
    determination of the Court of Appeal in Mahmood [2001] Imm AR  229  and
    in particular paragraph 55 of that case.  The Adjudicator  went  on  to
    consider whether there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  family
    living together in India.  It was noted that Mrs Kalsi was earning some
    ï¿½392 per month and the Claimant  was  not  employed.   However  he  was
    looking after the child while she was at work.  It was  submitted  that
    she would have to lose her employment and take care of the child if the
    Claimant was removed and that the child, also a British citizen,  would
    lose education and healthcare benefits.  Mrs Kalsi noted that  she  had
    never  visited  India  (although  she  is  clearly  of  Indian   ethnic
    background).  The Adjudicator, having considered the obstacles were not
    insurmountable, went on to note that  the  Claimant  had  been  in  the
    United Kingdom for 10 years and thus was long-established in the United
    Kingdom.  He then went on to state:-

       "Of course, the length of time  per  se  is  not  conclusive  as  to
       merits.  In this case I note also that the Appellant  has  not  been
       married  to  Mrs  Kalsi  for  the  duration  of   the   ten   years.
       Nevertheless, it is  a  significant  period  of  residence  in  this
       country.  What has only just narrowly persuaded  me  to  allow  this
       appeal, however, is Mrs Kalsi's statement that  if  her  husband  is
       removed she has to stop working so she could look  after  the  young
       child, she would not  be  able  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules on maintenance in order to Sponsor him or an entry
       clearance certificate to enable him to rejoin her as a spouse."

 5. He then went on to consider that these were real and practical, or even
    legal obstacles, to the establishment  of  family  life  and  therefore
    allowed the appeal.

The Adjudicator's Submissions

 6. Mr Gulvin produced to us the determination of the Court  of  Appeal  in
    Ekinci [2002] EWCA Civ 765.   He  submitted  that  this  determination,
    which followed on from  the  Mahmood  determination,  should  be  given
    strong persuasive weight  by  the  Tribunal  and  that  when  this  was
    considered against the determination of the Adjudicator it indicated  a
    substantive  error  by  the  Adjudicator.   He  referred  us   to   the
    determination and the quote referred to above.  He submitted  that  the
    consideration of the Adjudicator that the Claimant would not be able to
    meet the requirement of the Immigration Rules was speculative and  made
    in respect of an application that had not been made and was not  before
    the Adjudicator.  In this situation any temporary interference with the
    Claimant's  Article  8  rights  would  be  seen   as   legitimate   and
    proportionate.  In this regard he referred us to paragraphs 16  and  17
    of the determination in Ekinci and in particular:

          "16...  Secondly, however and to my mind more  fundamentally,  the
                 Secretary  of  State  submits  that  whether  or  not   the
                 Appellant will qualify for  entry  clearance  is  presently
                 material: it should be decided not now but when he comes to
                 apply.  Even if strictly he fails to  qualify  so  the  ECO
                 would be prohibited from granting leave to enter given  the
                 obvious Article 8 dimension to the case the ECO would refer
                 the application to an Immigration Officer  who  undoubtedly
                 has discretion to admit someone outside the Rules.  And  if
                 entry were to be refused  at  that  stage,  then  indeed  a
                 section 59 right of appeal would certainly arise in  which,
                 by virtue of section 65(3), (4)  and  (5)  the  Adjudicator
                 would have jurisdiction to consider the Appellant'

   17.      In my judgment this second argument is unanswerable.   It  would
       be a bizarre  and  unsatisfactory  result,  if  the  less  able  the
       Applicant is to satisfy the full requirements for  entry  clearance,
       the more readily he should  be  excused  the  need  to  apply...When
       granting permission to appeal, Sedley LJ said  of  this  Appellant's
       immigration history that "few claimants come to court with  a  track
       record of such prolonged evasion and mendacity".   True  it  is,  as
       Sedley LJ also observed, that "The protection of human  rights  also
       observed, that "The protection of human rights is not a  reward  for
       virtue and withholding or dilution of them  is  not  a  penalty  for
       vice" but that is not to say that a person's "immigration history is
       an irrelevant consideration when  striking  a  balance  between  his
       Article  8  rights  and  the  countervailing  public   interest   in
       maintaining  effective  immigration  control.   To  my  mind  it  is
       entirely understandable  that  the  Secretary  of  State  should  he
       require the Appellant to return  to  Germany  so  as  to  discourage
       others from circumventing the entry clearance system.  One authority
       which Mr Jacobs put before us was this  Court's  decision  in  Shala
       [2003] EWCA Civ 233.  In giving the leading judgment there Keene  LJ
       said at paragraph 10:



 7. The determination in Ekinci went on to find that in  Shala  exceptional
    circumstances were established but that in Ekinci they were not.

 8. Mr Gulvin also submitted that given the  findings  of  the  Adjudicator
    that they  were  not  insurmountable  obstacles,  a  term  set  out  in
    paragraph 55 of Mahmood the Adjudicator's determination should be  seen
    as perverse.  The Adjudicator had misled himself as to the factors that
    should be taken into account in the balancing exercise.   It  was  also
    submitted that this Claimant while he had been in  the  United  Kingdom
    for some ten years had clearly not been married for all  of  that  time
    and  for  a  period  from  1994  until  2000  had  been  an  absconder.
    Accordingly the reference from Mahmood that the Claimant had been "long-
    established" in this country ha to be seen in the light of the  reality
    of  this  Applicant's  own  immigration  history  and  the  Adjudicator
    appeared to have failed to  give  appropriate  consideration  to  these
    factors.  The narrow balancing exercise undertaken by  the  Adjudicator
    should therefore be seen as an error of law and  we  should  adopt  the
    rationale from Ekinci.  He further submitted that while each case  must
    be seen on its own facts it was clear there was an error of law in this
    case rendering the determination unsustainable.  In that situation  the
    Tribunal properly could look  at  the  facts  before  it  and  conclude
    whether or not there would be a breach of  Article  8(2)  by  assessing
    proportionality ourselves.  The issue of whether Mrs Kalsi wanted to go
    with the Appellant was entirely up to her and as  the  Adjudicator  had
    noted did not present an insurmountable  obstacle.   It  was  therefore
    submitted that the appeal should be allowed.

The Claimant's Submissions

 9. Mr Anisuddin submitted that the Adjudicator had carried out  a  correct
    building assessment and had noted the hardships of removal for both the
    Appellant's wife and child and  while  he  had  found  these  were  not
    insurmountable he had gone to take other factors into  account.   These
    included the facts that the Claimant had been in the United Kingdom for
    some ten years, whether lawful or otherwise, that  the  Claimant  looks
    after his child in this country, that the Appellant's wife  would  lose
    her employment and thus there would be great difficulty in meeting  the
    Immigration Rules in an application made in India by the Claimant.   He
    referred to the quotation in Ekinci noted above and  the  reference  to
    the determination of the Court of Appeal in Shala.  He  submitted  that
    in  this  case  the  Adjudicator  had  established   that   they   were
    "exceptional circumstances" and therefore the determination was  not  a
    perverse one.  Thus while he conceded that the Adjudicator  had  failed
    to follow the step-by-step approach recommended in the leading Tribunal
    determination in Nhundu  (01/TH/0613)  it  should  not  be  seen  as  a
    fundamental flaw  and  that  on  its  facts  the  determination  was  a
    sustainable one.

The Issue

10. We found the issue before us to be whether  the  determination  of  the
    Adjudicator was one that was clearly wrong  or  unsustainable?   If  so
    were we able to substitute our own determination of the proportionality
    issue?

Decision

11. We are satisfied that  the  determination  of  the  Adjudicator  is  an
    irrational one on the evidence that was before  him.   The  Adjudicator
    found that there were not insurmountable obstacles, a  highly  relevant
    factor in the guidance given in Mahmood.  However he had gone on to  be
    persuaded, primarily on the basis of the length of  time  the  Claimant
    had  been  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  because  of   the   potential
    difficulties there would be in the Appellant and his wife  establishing
    a valid claim for entry clearance as a spouse to allow  the  Article  8
    claim.  We have given careful consideration  to  the  determination  in
    Ekinci and find that it is strongly persuasive.  We would agree that it
    is bizarre and unsatisfactory if the situation should arise that  those
    least  able  to  meet  the  full  requirements   of   entry   clearance
    (Immigration Rules) should more readily be excused under Article 8  the
    need to apply than those who are able to meet the core requirements for
    entry clearance.  We also note that  the  determination  in  Shala  was
    reached on a substantially different set of facts.  In  that  case  the
    Court of Appeal found that the Claimant had come to the United  Kingdom
    as a putative refugee in 1998.  There was a delay of some four years in
    the processing of his application by the Secretary of State and  during
    that time the Claimant took steps to establish his private  and  family
    life in this country.  There was therefore the  strong  argument  that,
    nothing that refugee status is declaratory, Mr Shala  had  legitimately
    been in this country for more than four  years  and  therefore  it  was
    disproportionate for him to be removed to Kosovo.  The  situation  here
    is markedly different.  This Appellant came to the United  Kingdom  and
    applied for refugee status in 1992/1993.  That  was  refused.   He  was
    then illegally in this country as an absconder.  In the  year  2000  he
    then applied for entry clearance on the basis  of  his  marriage  to  a
    British citizen.  There has been no substantive delay by the  Secretary
    of State in the processing of the applications.  We are satisfied  that
    this is not a case where there are exceptional circumstances  and  that
    the  Adjudicator  has  carried  out  an  improper  assessment  of   the
    guidelines  set  out  in  Mahmood.   Those  guidelines  have  now  been
    elucidated by the determination in Ekinci.  In this situation therefore
    the appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.  We are satisfied that
    there would not be a real risk of a breach of Article  8  of  the  ECHR
    should  this  Applicant  be  returned  to  India.   In  reaching   this
    conclusion we have noted that the Adjudicator did  not  consider  there
    were insurmountable obstacles to the return, the Claimant's wife, while
    she may not have been to India is of Indian ethnic background  and  the
    child is of a very young age and would obviously be  totally  dependent
    on its parents at this time and thus it is in the interest of the child
    to accompany them.  We also agree that we should not place ourselves in
    a position where we speculate the results of a future  application  for
    entry clearance.  Clearly this must be determined on the factors before
    the ECO and, as rightly noted in Ekinci, there will also be  the  right
    to apply to an Immigration Officer for  consideration  outside  of  the
    Rules.

12. This appeal is allowed.
