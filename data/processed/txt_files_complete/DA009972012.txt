Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Ward instructed by Hoole & Co., Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Hibbs, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order by the First-tier Tribunal
    pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).   Neither  party  invited  me  to
    rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

 2. The appellant is a citizen of the United States of America who was born
    on 23 February 1984.  On 10 September 2010 the appellant was  convicted
    at the Bristol Crown Court of possession of a class B  controlled  drug
    namely cannabis/cannabis resin; possession  with  intent  to  supply  a
    class B controlled drug namely cannabis and possession of a  prohibited
    weapon.  On 11 February 2011, he was sentenced to a  total  of  fifteen
    months'  imprisonment  for  those  offences.   As  a  consequence,  the
    appellant was a "foreign criminal" falling within the  UK  Borders  Act
    2007.  On 25 October 2012, the Secretary of State made a decision  that
    s.32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied and on 3  May  2012  made  a
    deportation order against the appellant.

 3.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   and   in   a
    determination promulgated on 4 January  2013  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Davidge and Mr M G Taylor CBE,  DL)  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal.  The Tribunal found that the appellant's  deportation  was  not
    prohibited by the Immigration Rules (in  particular  para  397  of  the
    Rules) and further that the appellant's removal would not breach Art  8
    of the ECHR.

 4. On 22 January 2013, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bailey) granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  Thus, the appeal
    came before me.

The Submissions

 5. Ms Ward who represented the appellant (but had not done so  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal) relied upon the grounds of appeal and  a  skeleton
    argument submitted on the day of the hearing.  Ms Ward  submitted  that
    the point was a short one.  The appellant's case before the  First-tier
    Tribunal was that his deportation would interfere with his private  and
    family life with his wife and their two small children, as well as  his
    wife's younger brother who lived with them.  All the appellant's family
    are British citizens.  Ms Ward submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was wrong in  law  to  find  that  it  was  reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant's wife and their children to relocate to the  USA  with  him.
    Ms Ward submitted that was contrary to the approach recognised  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in Sanade and Others  (British  Children  -  Zambrano  -
    Dereci) [2012] UKUT 0048 (IAC) at [65(c)] and [95].  Ms Ward  submitted
    that the Upper Tribunal recognised that as EU citizens the  appellant's
    spouse and children could not  be  required  to  relocate  outside  the
    European Union and it was not open to the Secretary of State  to  argue
    that it was reasonable for them to do so.  Contrary to that, the First-
    tier Tribunal found that it was reasonable to  expect  the  appellant's
    wife and children to travel with him to the USA (see  para  43  of  the
    determination).  The First-tier Tribunal, therefore, Ms Ward submitted,
    had wrongly assessed the "best interests" of the  appellant's  children
    on the basis that they would be accompanying him to the USA rather than
    on the basis that there would be an inevitable split  between  him  and
    his family and had then failed to assess whether that was in  the  best
    interests of his children and whether the seriousness of his  offending
    was of such weight to justify that separation.

 6. Mr Hibbs did not seek  to  argue  that  Ms  Ward's  submission  was  in
    principle wrong.  Instead, he submitted that the issue  was  irrelevant
    because the new Immigration Rules had, in effect, in para 399  codified
    Sanade and consequently there was nothing left to be decided under  Art
    8 since the appellant could not  succeed  under  para  399.   Mr  Hibbs
    referred me to, and relied upon, the Administrative Court decision in R
    (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin),  especially  at  [30]  and  the
    decision of the Inner House of the Court of Session in MS v SSHD [2013]
    CSIH 52, especially at [26].

 7. In  response,  Ms  Ward  accepted  that  the  Immigration  Rules  would
    determine the vast majority of cases but that there  will  be  residual
    cases not covered by the Immigration Rules.  Ms Ward submitted this was
    one such case.  Certainly, she pointed  out,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    thought it was  such  a  case  as  it  devoted  38  paragraphs  of  its
    determination to Art 8 and only three to the Rules.  Ms Ward  submitted
    that the  Rules  did  not  adequately  consider  the  position  of  the
    appellant's wife as a  single  mother  in  the  UK  bringing  up  their
    children and also did not deal with the impact upon the children of not
    seeing their father for many years.

Discussion

     1. Sanade

 8. Ms  Ward's  principal  submission  based  upon  Sanade  is  undoubtedly
    correct.  Indeed, it was accepted to be so by Mr Hibbs.  In Sanade  the
    Chamber President (Blake J) said at [95]:

         "... Where the child or indeed the remaining spouse  is  a  British
         citizen and therefore a citizen of the European Union,  it  is  not
         possible to require them to relocate outside the European Union  or
         to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do so.  The  case
         serves  to  emphasise  the  importance   of   nationality   already
         identified in the decision of the Supreme Court in  ZH  (Tanzania).
         If interference with the family life is to  be  justified,  it  can
         only be so on the basis that  the  conduct  of  the  person  to  be
         removed gives rise to considerations of such weight as  to  justify
         separation."

 9. At [106] when considering the facts of Mr Sanade's appeal, noting  that
    his wife and children were British citizens,  Blake  J  identified  the
    relevant question to be addressed under Art 8 as:

         "Whether  Mr  Sanade's  conduct  is  so  serious  as  to  make   it
         proportionate to the legitimate aim in his case to require  him  to
         leave his wife and young children for an indefinite  period  unless
         and until the deportation order can be revoked".

10. In this appeal, the First-tier Tribunal found at  para  43  that  there
    was:

         "Nothing  in  the  evidence  before  us  which  shows   that   [the
         appellant's wife] cannot reasonably be expected  to  relocate  with
         her husband and children to America."

11. That finding was not one open to the Tribunal to make in the  light  of
    Sanade and the EU jurisprudence upon which it is based.  As  a  result,
    the First-tier Tribunal considered the best interest of the appellant's
    children and that of his wife's 9 year old brother who lived with  them
    on the basis that, at least the appellant's wife  and  their  children,
    would accompany him to the USA.

12. It appears that  the  Tribunal  was  led  into  this  approach  by  the
    appellant's then Counsel.  At para 6 of its determination,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal noted that the grounds of appeal to the Tribunal:

         "are that the Appellant  has  a  family  life  with  his  wife  and
         children  here,  and   the   decision   will   sever   the   family
         relationships, with the mother and children staying here."

13. That, of course, would be an approach consistent with Sanade.  However,
    the First-tier Tribunal went on to note that:

         "At the hearing the matter was pursued on a different basis, namely
         that the most significant disruption would be caused  by  the  wife
         and children going to America, so that the Article 8 rights of  the
         Appellant's wife's brothers would suffer severe interference."

14. That said, however, the skeleton argument of Counsel for the  appellant
    at the hearing clearly puts the case on the basis that the  appellant's
    wife and children cannot reasonably be expected to  accompany  him  and
    that it is not in the best interests of the children for the  appellant
    to be separated from his children and that that is  a  disproportionate
    interference with his (and their) family life.   It  may  be  that  the
    change in emphasis at the hearing  inadvertently  took  the  First-tier
    Tribunal down a road that it should not have travelled in the light  of
    Sanade.  In any event, as I have indicated, Mr Hibbs accepts  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in failing to follow the approach in  Sanade.
    His submissions focused on whether that error was material.

    2. Art 8 and the Rules

15. Mr Hibbs submitted that the First-tier Tribunal could not have  reached
    any other conclusion under Art 8  since  the  outcome  was  effectively
    determined by the Immigration Rules, namely para 399.

16. The consistent and cumulative case law of the Upper Tribunal recognises
    that since the new Immigration Rules came into force  on  9  July  2012
    dealing, on their face, with Art 8 issues,  that  the  Tribunal  should
    adopt a two-stage approach.  First,  it  should  determine  whether  an
    appellant can succeed under the relevant  Rules  dealing  with  private
    life, family life or in  respect  of  deportation.   If  the  appellant
    succeeds, there is no need to consider  Art  8  on  the  basis  of  the
    approach in the Strasbourg  cases.   But,  secondly,  if  an  appellant
    cannot succeed  under  the  Rules  the  Tribunal  should  consider  the
    application of Art 8 'outside the Rules'.  That position is clearly set
    out in MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT  00393;  Ogundimu
    (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria  [2013]  UKUT  0060  (IAC)  and  Izuazu
    (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 0045 (IAC).

17. In R (Nagre), Sales J approved the Upper Tribunal's approach.   However
    at [30], Sales J added a caveat as follows:

         "The only slight modification I would make,  for  the  purposes  of
         clarity, is to say that if, after the process of applying  the  new
         Rules and finding that the claim for leave  to  remain  under  them
         fails, the relevant official or Tribunal Judge considers that it is
         clear that the consideration under the Rules  has  fully  addressed
         any family life or private life issues arising under Article 8,  it
         will be sufficient simply to say that; they would not  have  to  go
         on, in addition, to consider the case separately  from  the  Rules.
         If there is no arguable case that there may  be  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside the Rules by reference to  Article
         8,  there  would  be  no  point  in   introducing   full   separate
         consideration of Article 8 again after having reached a decision on
         application of the Rules."

18. That approach was proved and applied by the Inner House of the Court of
    Session in MS.  At [26] Lord Drummond Young stated that:

         "We agree entirely with that qualification.  It seemed to  us  that
         the new Rules are likely to deal adequately with the great majority
         of cases where the Article 8 right to private or family life is put
         in issue.  In that event, there is no need to  go  on  to  consider
         Article 8 separately, using the type  of  analysis  set  out  in  R
         (Razgar) v Home Secretary ..."

19. Subsequent to Nagre, the Upper Tribunal  in  Green  (Article  8  -  new
    rules) [2013] UKUT 00354 (IAC), acknowledging Sales J's caveat in  [30]
    of his judgment, noted that in Nagre: "the difference between the Rules
    and the Strasbourg principles was marginal ...".  By contrast, in Green
    the Upper Tribunal examined the appellant's claim under Article 8 in  a
    deportation case where the appellant had committed  the  offence  as  a
    juvenile.  It's rationale for doing so was that this issue  was  not  a
    matter specifically dealt with in the Rules.

20. I begin with the relevant Immigration Rules which came into effect on 9
    July 2012.  Paragraph 398, so far as relevant, provides as follows:

         "398.    Where a person claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
             contrary to the UK's obligation under Article 8 of  the  Human
             Rights Convention, and ...

             (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
                  the public good because they have  been  convicted  of  an
                  offence for which they have been sentenced to a period  of
                  imprisonment of less than four years but at  least  twelve
                  months; ...

             The Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
             whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not,  it
             will only be in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
             interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors."

21. For these purposes, paragraph 399(a) and (b) are the relevant provision
    dealing  respectively  with  the  appellant's  relationship  with   his
    children and his partner.  Paragraph 399 provides as follows:

          "399.   This paragraph applies where  paragraph  398  (b)  or  (c)
             applies if -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is
                  in the UK, and
                  (i) the child is a British Citizen; or
                  (ii) the child has lived in the  UK  continuously  for  at
                      least the 7 years immediately preceding the  date  of
                      the immigration decision; and in either case
                      (a)  it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child
                           to leave the UK; and
                      (b)  there is no other family member who is  able  to
                           care for the child in the UK; or
             (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
                  a partner who is in the  UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
                  settled in the UK, or in the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
                  humanitarian protection, and
                  (i)  the person has lived  in  the  UK  with  valid  leave
                      continuously for at least the  15  years  immediately
                      preceding  the  date  of  the  immigration   decision
                      (discounting any period of imprisonment); and
                  (ii) there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
                      with that partner continuing outside the UK."

22. It is Mr Hibbs' submission that the error by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was not material because, in effect, there was nothing left  to  decide
    under Art 8 once the First-tier Tribunal  found  that  the  Immigration
    Rules did not apply.

23. The First-tier Tribunal dealt with the appellant's  claim  to  met  the
    requirements of the new Rules in paras 20-23 of its  determination.   I
    do not set out those paragraphs in full.  Suffice it to say,  the  only
    issue considered by the First-tier Tribunal was the application of para
    399(a) to the relationship between the appellant and his wife's younger
    brother.  At para 21 the First-tier Tribunal concluded that there was a
    "genuine subsisting parental relationship" between  the  appellant  and
    his wife's brother.  Given that finding, somewhat curiously the  First-
    tier Tribunal went on to find in para 22 that the  "relationship  falls
    short of a quality and character to be described as parental".  Leaving
    aside that contradiction, the First-tier Tribunal stated that,  in  any
    event, it had not been established that  there  was  "no  other  family
    member who is able to care" for the appellant's wife's younger  brother
    in the UK. The Tribunal does not appear, however, to have considered at
    all the application of  para  399(a)  to  the  appellant  and  his  own
    children or of para 399(b) in respect of the appellant and his wife.

24. Even if the appellant could not establish that he met the  requirements
    of the Rules - and there is an incomplete assessment of that  issue  by
    the First-tier Tribunal - that alone would not, in  my  judgment,  have
    excused the Tribunal from considering Art 8 'outside the Rules'.

25. This is not a case which fell within the caveat recognised in Nagre and
    MS.  That point is most acute and pressing when considering the  Art  8
    claim based upon the family life between  the  appellant  and  his  own
    children.  Whilst Mr Hibbs is right  to  some  extent  that  Sanade  is
    incorporated  within  para  399,  the  implications  of  it  are   not.
    Paragraph 399(a) requires where there  is  a  "genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship" with a child: (1) that the child  is  a  British
    citizen; (2) that it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
    leave the UK; and (3) that there is no other family member who is  able
    to care for the child in the UK.  Requirement (b) reflects  the  Sanade
    issue to the extent that Sanade resolves issue (b)  in  favour  of  the
    British citizen child.  However, under Art 8 that is only  one  of  the
    relevant issues to be considered in determining whether an individual's
    deportation would be proportionate.  It requires the decision maker, as
    the Upper Tribunal made clear in Sanade at [95], to approach the  issue
    of proportionality on the basis that there will be a  necessary  (long-
    term) separation between an appellant and his child  or  children.   In
    other words, that they will  remain  in  the  UK  whilst  he  has  been
    deported.  Under Art 8, it is then necessary for  the  Tribunal,  inter
    alia, to determine whether that separation is in the  "best  interests"
    of the children and to take those best  interests  into  account  as  a
    "primary consideration" in determining proportionality and whether  the
    seriousness of the appellant's offending outweighs  any  countervailing
    factors including the children's best interests.   Paragraph  399  does
    not encapsulate the full measure of that balancing exercise.   It  does
    not  expressly  require  a  consideration  of  the   children's   "best
    interests"  as  a  factor,  let  alone  a  primary  consideration,   in
    determining  whether  an  appellant's  deportation  is  in  the  public
    interest.  Paragraph 399 only  contemplates  one  situation  in  which,
    where the British citizen child cannot reasonably be expected to  leave
    the UK, the public interest will be outweighed and that  is  where  "no
    other family member ... is able to care  for  the  child  in  the  UK".
    Paragraph 399(a) does not allow for an assessment of  a  child's  "best
    interests" where, for example, it has two parents, one of whom is to be
    deported whilst the other will remain in  the  UK  as  is  his  or  her
    entitlement.  That, of course, is the situation in this appeal.

26. The importance of a child's best interests in  determining  whether  an
    individual's removal or deportation is a breach of Art 8 is part of the
    established jurisprudence  of  the  Strasbourg  court  (see  the  Grand
    Chamber decisions in �ner v The Netherlands (Application No.  46410/99)
    [2007] INLR 273 at [58]; and Maslov v Austria (Application No. 1638/03)
    [2009] INLR 47 at [68] citing �ner).   Equally,  the  importance  of  a
    "child's best interests" in the context of immigration decision  making
    is enshrined in s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
    2009 and is an integral part of assessing proportionality under  Art  8
    of the ECHR as recognised by the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) v  SSHD
    [2011] UKSC 4.

27. For these reasons, I do not accept Mr Hibbs' submission  that  in  this
    appeal the Tribunal was not required to  consider  Art  8  outside  the
    Rules because it fell within the caveat recognised in Nagre and MS.  In
    my judgment, this was a case where there was a difference  between  the
    content of the Rules and the proper approach to Art 8 set  out  in  the
    Strasbourg case law and the UK's domestic law.

28. Consequently, the First-tier Tribunal's failure  properly  to  consider
    the appellant's claim that  his  deportation  would  breach  Art  8  in
    accordance with the principles recognised in  Sanade  was  material  to
    their decision to dismiss his appeal.  That decision cannot  stand  and
    is set aside.

Decision and Disposal

29. If that was my decision, Ms Ward invited me to remit the appeal to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to consider the application of  Art  8.   Mr  Hibbs
    indicated that he was neutral  as  to  whether  the  appeal  should  be
    remitted or retained in the Upper Tribunal.

30. Bearing in mind  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements, and having regard to the extent and  nature  of  the  fact-
    finding (including the evidence to be relied upon), I am satisfied that
    this is an appropriate case to be remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a rehearing of the appellant's appeal in respect of Art 8.  It  was
    common ground between the parties that none of  the  Tribunal  findings
    could be preserved save those in para 54 of its determination.
