Interpreter:  Mr S Duhre interpreted the Punjabi and English languages
                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of India.  He appeals with  the  permission
      of a First-tier Tribunal Judge a decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      on 9 March 2020 to dismiss  his  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
      respondent on 19 November 2019 refusing him leave  to  remain  on  the
      basis of his private and family life in the United Kingdom.

   2. The judge who granted permission was struggling with narrative grounds
      in manuscript prepared by the appellant but found it arguable that the
      judge who determined the appeal had erred in concluding there was  not
      a "genuine and subsisting parental relationship" between the appellant
      and a qualifying child.  The short point is that he  was  having  some
      contact with his children.

   3. The appellant's immigration history is discreditable.  He says that he
      entered the United Kingdom clandestinely on 28 December 2001.  Be that
      as it may, he was certainly present on 3 July 2012 when he applied for
      leave to remain as a husband.  That application was successful and  he
      was given leave that expired on 4 September 2015.  He made an in  time
      application and his leave was extended until 29 April  2018  and  then
      until 16 December 2020.  However,  on  31  July  2019  his  leave  was
      curtailed with a new expiry date of 4 October 2019 because  there  had
      been a breakdown in his relationship with his wife.

   4. On 1 October 2019 he applied for leave to remain on the basis  of  his
      family and private life. The respondent treated  the  application  was
      based on private life only and the decision to refuse the  application
      was the subject of the appeal that is challenged before me.

   5. As the Reasons for Refusal explained, the breakdown  of  the  marriage
      meant that, according to the respondent, the family life route was not
      open to the appellant. However, it is a plain fact in  the  case  that
      there are two children involved.  The children concerned are a son who
      I identify simply as "M" who was born in September 2003 and so is  now
      17 years old, and a daughter, "G", who was born in November  2004  and
      so is now 16 years old.  They are not the biological children  of  the
      appellant but (obviously)  that  does  not  mean  that  they  are  not
      enjoying a parental relationship with the appellant.

   6.  The  respondent  decided  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
      "suitability requirements" of the rule because on 25 November 2015  he
      had been cautioned for common assault and did not declare that when he
      later applied for leave to remain.  The respondent regarded this as  a
      failure to disclose a material fact in relation to an application.

   7. The Secretary of State noted that the appellant did not claim to  have
      lived in the United Kingdom for twenty years and so could not  qualify
      under the provisions for people who have lived in the  United  Kingdom
      for at least twenty years. Further he failed to show that  there  were
      "very significant obstacles" to reintegration into life in India.  The
      appellant had lived in India until he was about 19 years old  and  had
      made frequent visits there during this stay in the United Kingdom.

   8. The respondent saw no reason why his ability to adapt to life  in  the
      United Kingdom could not be matched with an  ability  to  re-adapt  to
      life in India.  The respondent looked  for  exceptional  circumstances
      and noted that an earlier application had succeeded after hearing  how
      the appellant supported his wife who was disabled  but  that  marriage
      had now ended and his leave was curtailed.  His wife clearly had close
      relatives to support her  in  the  United  Kingdom  because  they  are
      identified in the papers.

   9. The respondent correctly considered the  needs  of  the  children  and
      found they were living contentedly with their natural mother.  It  was
      in their best interests to remain there and  they  did  not  need  the
      appellant to be in the United Kingdom.

  10. I consider now how the appeal was decided by the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge.

  11. The appellant was represented by the First-tier Tribunal.   The  judge
      concluded  unequivocally  that  the  appellant  had   provided   false
      information.  The problem is that the appellant had been cautioned for
      an assault but had indicated on his application form in  answer  to  a
      question about "convictions and other penalties" which made  it  plain
      that the appellant should declared any caution, warning, reprimand  or
      other penalty.  The appellant had not  simply  answered  the  question
      with the word "No" but expanded it to "No.  I have never  had  any  of
      these".  The judge found that  this  was  a  lie  and  not  simply  an
      oversight or mistake.

  12. There is no doubt that the appellant was no longer a "partner" because
      the relationship that been relied upon had ended.  However  the  judge
      was particularly interested in the appellant's relationship  with  the
      children of his  wife.   The  judge  endorsed  the  criticism  of  the
      appellant's representative that the respondent had not considered  the
      relationship with the children.  It  just  did  not  follow  that  the
      relationship with the step-children ended with the marriage.  However,
      the appellant did not have "sole responsibility" for the children  and
      they did not live with him but he had some direct contact  with  them.
      The judge directed  himself  that  the  appellant  must  show  he  was
      intending, and continued, to take an active role in their upbringing.

  13. The judge said that he accepted that  the  appellant  was  seeing  the
      children and referred to two videos  of  the  appellant  inside  their
      house.  The videos did not show a great  deal  of  interaction  but  I
      remind myself that they are teenage children.

  14. The appellant produced evidence he had taken the children to Cineworld
      and Creams Caf� and photographed them together.   The  judge  said  at
      paragraph 33 that "all this however, I find, falls  sort  [short?]  of
      the necessary evidence required to show that he is taking, and intends
      to continue to take, an active role in the children's upbringing".

  15. Paragraph 34 of the decision and reasons is, I find, important  and  I
      set it out in its entirety:

  "The children live with their mother (who is their  natural  mother)  and
  there is no evidence that anyone apart from her has any role in  bringing
  the children up.  There is  no  evidence  of  any  financial  support  or
  contribution that the appellant may be giving to the children.  There  is
  nothing from the children themselves as  to  their  perception  of  their
  relationship with the appellant.  The appellant has given two contrasting
  reasons for this - either that the mother has demanded �10,000 before she
  releases their statements, or (the explanation given at the hearing) that
  the appellant does not want to bring the children into the appeal  -  but
  whatever the reason the Tribunal is without this evidence.  The appellant
  has provided no evidence of ever taking an important decision  on  behalf
  of the children (such as in relation to health or education).  The photos
  and videos are evidence of them seeing each other on occasion, but do not
  evidence any role in their upbringing.  I find on all the  evidence  that
  the appellant does not meet the requirements of E-LTRPT 2.4(b).   He  has
  not, I find, established that he has taken on, and continues to take  on,
  the role that a 'parent' usually plays in the life of their child.  There
  appears in addition to be no prospect in the foreseeable  future  of  the
  nature and extent of any such role developing - the mother  is  described
  as being antagonistic to the appellant and the children at the ages of 15
  and 16 will be developing their own lives by now.  It is not necessary to
  consider  EX.1  because  E-LTRPT  2.4(b)  is  a   mandatory   requirement
  irrespective of EX.1".

  16. The judge then concluded there would be no very significant  obstacles
      in the way of the appellant  re-establishing  himself  in  India.   He
      lived there until he was 19 years old and still  has  parents  in  the
      country who could be expected to help him  re-establish  himself.   He
      has visited India during his stay in the United Kingdom in every  year
      from 2013 to 2019 and speaks Punjabi. Indeed the judge noted that  the
      appellant required an interpreter to give  evidence  at  the  hearing.
      There was no suggestion that he had forgotten how to speak Punjabi.

  17. The judge went on to look at Article 8 of the European  Convention  on
      Human Rights and set out standard appropriate self-directions of law.

  18. The judge then considered the best interests  of  the  children.   The
      judge looked again at the finding that their  upbringing  was  in  the
      hands of their mother who was a British  citizen.  The  children  were
      then aged 15 and 16 years old and they were British  citizens.   Their
      best interests, the judge found, was "overwhelmingly to remain in  the
      UK".  The judge found that the appellant was not taking an active role
      in their upbringing and they were of an age  when  they  were  looking
      forward to independent lives.

  19. The judge then reminded himself of Section 117B(6) of the Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and found that the appellant  had  not
      established a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with  the
      children.  The judge accepted that there was  some  contact  with  the
      children but that was all.  The judge dismissed the appeal.

  20. Before me I  asked  the  appellant  to  explain  what  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge had got wrong.  The appellant had no difficulty telling
      me the age of his children and said that although they  were  not  his
      biological children they "grew up in my hands and care"  and  recently
      he had been having occasional contact  which  was  considered  in  the
      decision.  He  touched  on  the  reasons  for  the  breakdown  of  his
      relationship with their mother.  He said another person was  involved.
      He repeated his claim that his wife wanted a premium of �10,000 to  be
      more co-operative.

  21. I put it  to  the  appellant  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
      findings were that whatever had gone on the appellant no longer had  a
      parental relationship with the children.  He understood the point  and
      found it hard to criticise although insisted that he  wanted  a  close
      relationship with the children who had been part of his family through
      most of their lives.

  22. Mr Lindsay's submissions were very simple.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge had considered the evidence sensibly and appropriately  and  had
      reached an entirely  rational  conclusion.   The  appellant,  who  was
      plainly articulate, was not able to add very much to what he had  told
      me.

  23. I make it plain that I make no findings on the appellant's claim  that
      he has now lived in the United Kingdom now for over  twenty  years.  I
      had no reason to determine the point.

  24. What is clear is that the appellant has been  married  in  the  United
      Kingdom and that he lived with his wife and her children and that they
      were therefore in the broadest sense, part of his family. There is  no
      or little evidence  of  anything  that  would  make  the  relationship
      "parental" rather than a supportive but lessor relationship and  there
      is no evidence of a parental relationship now.

  25. If, as sometimes happens when marriages break down, his former partner
      has deliberately squeezed him out of the lives of the children that is
      to her discredit but I do not have to decide if that has happened.   I
      merely make the point that if it has happened then he his role in  the
      lives of  the  children  has  diminished  and  the  reasons  for  that
      diminution do not give him rights to  remain.   Family  break-ups  are
      frequently unhappy and often unhappiest for the people least at fault,
      but there is no evidence before me to  indicate  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge did anything other than make  an  entirely  appropriate
      decision after careful consideration of the evidence.

  26. I have reflected on the submissions and  the  papers  with  particular
      care because the appellant is not represented but I find  no  material
      error of law in the decision and I dismiss this appeal.
