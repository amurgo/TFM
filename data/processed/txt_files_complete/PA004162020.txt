For the Appellant:     Mr I. Meikle, Counsel instructed by Ferial
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A. McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Egypt born  in  1991.  He  appeals  with
    permission against  the  3rd  June  2020  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge JC Hamilton) to dismiss his appeal on asylum and  human
    rights grounds.

    Anonymity Order

 2. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    Background and Matters in Issue

 3. The basis of the Appellant's claim to protection was that he has a well-
    founded fear of  persecution  in  Egypt  for  reasons  of  his  imputed
    political opinion, viz supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood.  He further
    claimed to have evaded military service,  disobeyed  orders  and  twice
    deserted, and to have been convicted in absentia in  respect  of  these
    matters,  receiving  a  sentence  of  15  years'   imprisonment.    The
    particulars of that claim were that having been  drafted  in  2011  the
    Appellant had been ordered to fire upon civilian protestors during  the
    uprising against President Mubarak; rather than doing  so  he  had  run
    away.

 4. On appeal to the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant relied inter alia on
    a report prepared by journalist  and  country  expert  Hugh  Miles  who
    opined that the Appellant's claim was plausible in  light  of  what  he
    knows about conditions in Egypt and the uprising  against  Mubarak;  Mr
    Miles further stated  that  anyone  with  a  perceived  association  or
    sympathy with the Brotherhood faces a real risk of harm. The  Appellant
    further  relied  upon  a  number  of  documents  which   purported   to
    corroborate his claims.

 5.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  identified  several  discrepancies  in  the
    Appellant's evidence  from  which  it  drew  adverse  inference.  These
    related to when he joined the  army  and  when  the  alleged  desertion
    occurred [�56-62],  whether he could obtain identity documentation from
    Egypt [�54], when and how the Appellant became aware  of  the  sentence
    against him [�71] and the economic status of his family in Egypt [�75].
     The Appellant's claim to have been targeted because he was  a  support
    of the Brotherhood contrasted with the country  background  information
    which indicates that sympathisers and supporters are not at risk  [�77]
    - nor was his own expert able  to  support  his  claim  since  he  only
    referred to cases involving "quite  high  profile"  members  and  their
    family members [�79].   The  Tribunal  did  not  expressly  reject  the
    Appellant's evidence that he is a regular advocate for the  Brotherhood
    at Speaker's Corner in London, but it was not satisfied that there  was
    a real risk that he could have been identified as such by the  Egyptian
    authorities [�86].  It found that if he were as committed as he  claims
    he would have attended other events.   Overall  the  Tribunal  was  not
    prepared to accept that  the  Appellant  was  who  he  says  he  is,  a
    supporter of the Brotherhood, that he deserted the army, was  sentenced
    to prison or that he participates in  "anti-government  activities"  in
    London.  The appeal was therefore dismissed.

 6. Before this Tribunal the Appellant contends that the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal is flawed for the following material errors of law:

      i) In misinterpreting/failing to have regard to the  totality  of  the
         country background evidence which indicates that supporters of  the
         Brotherhood do face persecution in Egypt ("the supporter issue")

     ii) In its  assessment  of  the  evidence  on  criminal  penalties  the
         Tribunal erroneously conflated those applicable to  desertion  with
         those imposed for draft evasion ("the desertion issue"); and

    iii)  Failing  to  give  reasons/adequate  reasons  in  respect  of  the
         Appellant's sur place activities and the likelihood that they  will
         have come to the attention of the Egyptian state and  be  perceived
         as anti-government ("the surveillance issue").

    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 7. My first observation would be that in general  terms,  this  First-tier
    Tribunal decision is cogent, detailed and fair.  This  is  not  a  case
    where the Tribunal has rejected everything that the  Appellant  has  to
    say. To the contrary the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's  criticisms
    of several aspects of the evidence. It accepted, for instance, that the
    Egyptian documents had been sent to the  Appellant's  solicitor  [�48],
    that the Appellant's descriptions of the injuries  he  sustained  after
    being beaten during military service were consistent and consonant with
    the country background material [�65], and that it was  plausible  that
    the Appellant might have mistakenly placed some faith in the fact  that
    the Muslim Brotherhood had come to power [�67].  The Tribunal  reminded
    itself that if a witness fabricates one part of an account it does  not
    necessarily mean that the entire account can  be  dismissed  [�74]  and
    that "memory is a malleable construct" which can be unreliable [�44].

 8. The question for me is not only whether the discrete criticisms made by
    Mr Meikle are made out, but whether they are of sufficient  materiality
    to warrant interfering with the decision  below.   This  was  the  real
    matter in issue between the parties. As I explain below, Mr McVeety for
    the Secretary of State was prepared to  accept  that  there  were  some
    difficulties with the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  but  hotly
    disputed that they were such that the decision had to fall: Mr  McVeety
    submitted that where so many reasons were given  by  the  Tribunal  for
    rejecting this claim errors in respect of a few of these  reasons  will
    not be  material.  Mr  Meikle  on  the  other  hand  submitted  that  a
    credibility assessment is by its nature a global  appraisal,  and  that
    where a decision-maker has embarked on his assessment in, for instance,
    misapprehension of  the  facts,  then  that  appraisal  is  necessarily
    infected by error.

 9. Against that background I evaluate each of  the  three  grounds  before
    reaching a conclusion on whether the decision must be set aside.




    Ground (i): The Brotherhood

10.  I  start  with  the  'supporter'  issue.    The  whole  basis  of  the
    Appellant's case was that as a supporter of the Muslim  Brotherhood  he
    faced disproportionate punishment and problems during  his  time  as  a
    soldier in the Egyptian army. He disobeyed orders, deserted, and  faced
    beating and persecution  because  of  his  political  convictions.  The
    Tribunal gave, as I summarise at my �5 above, several  reasons  why  it
    did not find the burden of proof discharged in respect of these claims.
    Mr Meikle submits, however, that central to the Tribunal's analysis was
    its finding at its �82:

         "I do not accept the Appellant has shown that generally,  low-level
         supports of the MB or its sympathisers are  at  any  real  risk  of
         significant mistreatment in Egypt".

    That being the Tribunal's view of the objective  situation,  Mr  Meikle
    submits, it coloured the view  that  that  the  Tribunal  took  to  the
    Appellant's claims. At its �77, for instance,  the  Tribunal  contrasts
    the Appellant's evidence that he was scared  of  the  authorities  with
    background information - relied upon by the  Respondent  -  that  as  a
    'mere' supporter he had no reason to be afraid.

11. Mr Meikle submits that the Tribunal's conclusion  on  this  matter  was
    wholly contrary to the evidence before it.   He begins  with  the  CPIN
    dated July 2017 entitled Egypt: Muslim Brotherhood.    Several  sources
    are cited in the grounds but section 6.2.8 serves as an example of  the
    kind of evidence that Mr Meikle  says  the  Tribunal  appears  to  have
    overlooked:

         6.2.8 A House of Commons  Library  research  briefing  of  February
         2016, based on a range of sources, summarised:

             'The Sisi government, supported by the anti-MB Gulf States  of
             Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  Emirates,  has  conducted  a
             vigorous crackdown  on  supporters  of  the  MB.  The  MB  was
             declared a terrorist organisation in  December  2013  and  its
             assets were confiscated, while its political  wing,  the  FJP,
             was later dissolved. Human Rights Watch reported that probably
             as many as a thousand of its  supporters  were  killed  during
             demonstrations after the toppling of President Morsi...  'Over
             40,000 people were detained or indicted in less  than  a  year
             after the coup and reports of torture  and  disappearances  at
             the hands  of  the  police  and  other  security  forces  were
             widespread... The government has made it much  more  difficult
             to hold demonstrations and easier for the police to ban  them.
             Many of the arrests are for violations of the  new  framework,
             in place since November 2013... 'In June 2014 three Al-Jazeera
             journalists were given  jail  sentences  on  terrorism-related
             charges. Al-Jazeera is regarded as being close to the  MB.  By
             summer 2014, the  human  rights  group  Amnesty  International
             described the decline in the protection  of  human  rights  as
             'catastrophic'. 'Thousands of MB leaders and  supporters  have
             been imprisoned - the group said in 2015 that  29,000  of  its
             sympathisers were in custody.'

         (Emphasis added).

12.  The  expert  too,  had  provided  multiple  examples  of   Brotherhood
    supporters, as opposed to members, suffering the  consequence  of  that
    support.  Although the Tribunal finds Mr Miles to have identified  only
    "quite high profile" members experiencing problems, in fact, submits Mr
    Meikle, his report ranged wider than that.

13. I accept that the country background information that  was  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  indicted  that  'low-level'  supporters  of   the
    Brotherhood have suffered politically motivated persecution  in  Egypt.
    I also accept that the First-tier Tribunal appears to have proceeded on
    the basis that this is not normally the case. The Tribunal here appears
    to have been adopting the Respondent's policy statement -  that  is  to
    say her interpretation of the objective situation - expressed at  2.2.5
    of the CPIN:

         '2.2.5  The  authorities  are  unlikely  to  have   the   capacity,
         capability or interest in seeking to target all persons  associated
         with the MB given the  size  and  variety  of  its  membership  and
         support base. The evidence does not establish that merely  being  a
         member of, or, in particular, a  supporter  of  the  MB,  or  being
         perceived to support the MB, will place a  person  is  at  risk  of
         persecution or serious harm.'

14. The question is whether the Tribunal, in its acceptance of that policy,
    closed its mind  to  the  evidence  that  notwithstanding  the  general
    position, it remains the case that some supporters of  the  Brotherhood
    do indeed suffer persecution, as the CPIN itself goes on to acknowledge
    at 2.2.6:

         '2.2.6 Whether a person is at  risk  of  ill-treatment  because  of
         their involvement with, or  perceived  support  for,  the  MB  will
         depend upon their circumstances, profile, activities, and  previous
         contact and difficulties with the state. The onus is on the  person
         to demonstrate that they are likely to be of interest to the  state
         and subject to treatment amounting to persecution or serious harm.'

15. The passage relied upon by Mr Meikle was at  the  Tribunal's  �77,  the
    relevant parts of which read:

         "In his March 2020 statement, the Appellant was clear  that  he  is
         not and has never been a member of the MB  but  asserts  that  even
         people who  only  support  or  sympathise  with  the  MB  would  be
         persecuted in Egypt....In contrast the background information about
         Egypt evidence relied upon by  the  Respondent  in  particular  the
         CPIN, states sympathisers and supporters are not at risk"

16. As I have set out above, the CPIN was not as unequivocal as  that:  the
    Respondent's position is that there is no general risk, not that  there
    is no risk at all.  The CPIN in fact  contained  numerous  examples  of
    instances where supporters did face  politically-motivated  arrest  and
    other forms of persecution.  For that reason I find that the ground  is
    made out.  It is not sufficiently clear from the face of  the  decision
    that the First-tier Tribunal understood that the claim  was  plausible,
    when the country background material was read as a whole.

    Ground (ii): Desertion

17. This ground can be shortly stated, since Mr McVeety  accepts  that  the
    alleged error was made out. At paragraph 81 of its decision the  First-
    tier Tribunal says, in the context of the Appellant's evidence that  he
    had received a sentence of imprisonment of 15 years, this: "the  expert
    conceded that the sentence for desertion was normally 2-3  years".  The
    parties before me agreed that this was not what the expert,  Mr  Miles,
    had said. The reference in the report to sentences  of  2-3  years  had
    related to draft evasion, as opposed to  desertion  from  active  duty,
    which is what the  Appellant  claims  he  did.   As  such  the  adverse
    inferences drawn  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  this  matter  were
    unjustified.   It had rejected as not credible the claimed sentence  of
    15 years because that was such a huge inflation of what it believed the
    normal punishment to  be:  in  fact  the  maximum  punishment  for  the
    Appellant's crime was death or "unlimited" detention. In  that  context
    15 years appeared quite consistent with the law and practice in Egypt.

18. I accept that the First-tier Tribunal has here erred in fact.   Whether
    that is material, that is to say whether it is an error such  that  the
    decision should be set aside, is a matter I consider below.

    Ground (iii): Sur Place Activities

19. The final issue arising concerns the Appellant's evidence that  in  the
    past  few  years  he  has  continued  to  voice  his  support  for  the
    Brotherhood by attending London's Hyde Park, possibly Speakers' Corner,
    to attend and participate in meetings there.  The expert Mr  Miles  had
    opined that the Egyptian authorities would be monitoring such diasporic
    activities, and that it was reasonably  likely  that  they  would  have
    identified the Appellant if he were in  attendance  there.    He  based
    that opinion on his own extensive experience of living  in  Egypt,  his
    understanding of how the regime operates, and  his  relationships  with
    dissidents both inside and outside the  country.  He  included  in  his
    report a photograph he took at a protest outside the  Egyptian  embassy
    in London, showing a figure with a camera at  a  window,  videoing  the
    people below.  Mr Miles confirmed that Hyde Park is frequently the site
    of meetings of Egyptian opposition groups: he has seen  these  meetings
    himself.

20. The Tribunal  does  not  reject  the  Appellant's  evidence  about  his
    attendance at Speakers' Corner. It  does  however  reject  the  opinion
    offered by Mr Miles, on the basis that it is not "sufficiently cogent":
    it is found to be "poorly sourced". The Tribunal concludes: "I  do  not
    find the Appellant has shown the Egyptian government has the  resources
    to  monitor  attendees,  even  regular  attendees,  at  anti-government
    events".

21. Mr Meikle submits that in reaching  these  findings  the  Tribunal  has
    failed to give adequate reasons why it rejects the evidence of Mr Miles
    on this matter. Mr Miles did explain where he got his information about
    the monitoring of diasporic activities. He did  not  obtain  it  simply
    from reading about it, in for instance human rights reports,  but  from
    his own knowledge, derived from many years working as a journalist  and
    writer in Egypt - in  the  numerous  conversations  and  interviews  he
    conducted over that time. Importantly he also based his opinion on  his
    own observations: having attended such protests in  London  himself  he
    had seen state agents videoing and photographing the crowds. I  do  not
    think it is impermissible speculation on his part to conclude that  the
    agents are doing this for a purpose, namely the purpose of  identifying
    those present. Mr Miles has brought his own expertise to bear  on  this
    matter. As such it could not simply be dismissed as un-sourced: he  was
    the  source.   Furthermore  the  evidence  of  Mr  Miles  was  entirely
    consistent with the accepted country background information about  what
    is happening in Egypt  itself,  namely  a  ruthless  crackdown  on  any
    perceived opposition. As such this was a  situation  akin  to  that  in
    Eritrea considered by Lord Justice Sedley in YB (Eritrea)  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 360:

         "18. As has been seen (�7 above),  the  tribunal,  while  accepting
         that  the  appellant's  political  activity  in  this  country  was
         genuine, were not prepared to accept in  the  absence  of  positive
         evidence that the Eritrean  authorities  had  "the  means  and  the
         inclination" to monitor such activities as a demonstration  outside
         their embassy, or that they would be able to identify the appellant
         from photographs of the demonstration. In my judgment, and  without
         disrespect to what is a specialist  tribunal,  this  is  a  finding
         which risks losing  contact  with  reality.  Where,  as  here,  the
         tribunal has objective evidence which "paints a  bleak  picture  of
         the suppression of political opponents" by a named  government,  it
         requires little or no evidence or speculation to arrive at a strong
         possibility - and perhaps more - that  its  foreign  legations  not
         only film or photograph their nationals who demonstrate  in  public
         against  the   regime   but   have   informers   among   expatriate
         oppositionist organisations who can name the people who are  filmed
         or photographed. Similarly it does not require affirmative evidence
         to establish a probability that the intelligence services  of  such
         states monitor the internet  for  information  about  oppositionist
         groups. The real question in most cases will be  what  follows  for
         the individual claimant. If, for example, any information  reaching
         the embassy is likely to be  that  the  claimant  identified  in  a
         photograph  is  a  hanger-on  with  no  real  commitment   to   the
         oppositionist cause, that will go directly to the issue flagged  up
         by art 4(3)(d) of the Directive."

22. I am satisfied that this ground is made out.

    Conclusion

23. Mr McVeety was quite right to point to the credibility  problems  faced
    by this Appellant. Aside from  what  might  generously  be  called  the
    'section 8' issues, his chronology could quite fairly be described as a
    mess.  It may be that in the final analysis the contradictions  in  the
    Appellant's account are such that he is unable to discharge the  burden
    of proof. I am however satisfied that the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal cannot stand. I have reached that conclusion with some regret;
    it is in many respects an exemplary decision. The  errors  are  however
    such that  I  cannot  extricate  them  from  the  credibility  findings
    overall. Had the Tribunal not misunderstood,  as  it  appears  to  have
    done, the  evidence  about  sentencing,  and  the  evidence  about  the
    problems faced by Brotherhood supporters, the  Appellant's  claims  may
    have seemed more credible than they were found to be. The  standard  of
    proof being what it is, I am unable to say that this was immaterial.

24. The parties were in agreement that if I found either or both of grounds
    1 and 2  made out then the appropriate disposal would be to remit  this
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal so that it may be heard afresh.




    Decisions

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  of  law  such
    that it must be set aside.

26. The decision in the appeal is to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

27. There is an order for anonymity.
