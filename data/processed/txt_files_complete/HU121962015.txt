                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Tufan (Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms C Bexson (counsel for AJA Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 1 October  2018  allowing  the  appeal  of
       Sacarah [H] (who I shall refer to as Miss  [H]  for  convenience),  a
       citizen of Jamaica born 15 February 1998, itself brought against  the
       refusal (of 26 October 2015) of her human rights claim.


  The background to the present proceedings


    2. Miss [H]'s application was based on her  wish  to  join  her  mother,
       [SH]. It was her mother's case that she had held sole  responsibility
       for her upbringing in recent years.

    3. A similar  assertion  had  been  made  in  the  past,  and  rejected,
       following two  applications,  on  both  occasions  the  Secretary  of
       State's thinking being upheld on appeal.

    4. Miss [H] was born when her mother, the Sponsor, was aged 16. She  and
       the Sponsor were compelled to leave the home of the Sponsor's  mother
       (i.e. Miss [H]'s grandmother) given the domestic  fall-out  from  the
       pregnancy and birth. Miss [H]'s father had not been  heard  of  since
       the Appellant was three  months  old.  The  Appellant  moved  in  her
       godmother, [IM], with whom she was left when the Sponsor came to  the
       UK in 2001, as a student; she subsequently obtained indefinite  leave
       to remain as a spouse, in 2007.  The  Appellant  remained  with  [IM]
       until the latter's death in 2007.

    5. Miss [H] next went to live with [JD], a family friend, though Ms [JD]
       had been unable to accommodate her once her own family  grew,  having
       already had two children and being pregnant  with  another  one.  The
       Sponsor could not return to Jamaica to look after her at  that  time,
       as by now her nursing career was  progressing  in  the  UK;  she  had
       become a staff nurse, and was undertaking a  university  course  from
       2010 to 2013. An application to join her mother was made  on  2  June
       2008, and refused; the ensuing appeal was dismissed on 5 March 2009.


    6. Miss [H] then moved out of Ms [JD]'s  accommodation  and  lived  with
       another family friend, [SK], from 2010. This was  intended  to  be  a
       temporary arrangement, but in fact endured for a significant  period.
       The second entry clearance application was  made  in  2012,  and  the
       appeal against its  refusal  was  dismissed  by  Judge  Moore  on  12
       February 2014, at which time Miss [H] still lived with Ms [SK].


    7. The current application was made on 14 October 2015. By now Miss  [H]
       had lived with  [MM]  since  April  2015,  there  being  nobody  else
       available to care for her; a letter from Ms [MM] of 23 November  2015
       explained that she had seen this as a temporary  measure  that  would
       hopefully not last for more than six to eight months; she decided  to
       help the Sponsor, who was a friend from their younger  days,  because
       of the latter's desperation. The Sponsor had made trips to  see  Miss
       [H], taking her other daughter with her.


    8. The application leading to the appeal now before me was refused on 26
       October 2015, the Entry Clearance Manager maintaining  that  decision
       on 7 July 2016.


  Past appellate findings


    9. The Tribunal which dismissed the  appeal  in  March  2009  identified
       discrepancies in the evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the
       Appellant's residence with [JD], having formed  the  impression  that
       the evidence of the Sponsor and Ms [JD] had been contrived to give  a
       false impression of the extent of the Sponsor's  involvement  in  her
       daughter's upbringing.


   10. In his  decision  of  February  2014,  against  the  refusal  of  the
       application made in 2012, Judge Moore saw no reason  to  differ  from
       the 2009 appeal findings. He also noted that  the  Sponsor's  witness
       statement indicated that the problem with Ms [H]'s ongoing  residence
       with [SK] was that the  accommodation  was  unsuitable,  but  at  the
       hearing the Sponsor had stated that there  had  been  a  relationship
       breakdown between them. There was  also  a  discrepancy  between  the
       evidence given now and the application form, which had indicated that
       the Appellant had always lived with [SK]; Judge Moore was unimpressed
       by the explanation given for that  statement.  Judge  Moore  accepted
       that the Appellant had consistently lived with family  friends  since
       the Sponsor's departure for the UK in 2001, albeit she  had  extended
       family in Jamaica too. Overall he did not accept that  the  Appellant
       had exercised sole  responsibility  for  her  daughter's  upbringing,
       albeit that he accepted that she had paid towards her school fees and
       kept in regular contact with her. The evidence  indicated  that  [SK]
       had instructed and advised the Appellant to a significant degree.  So
       he rejected the assertion that the Sponsor held  sole  responsibility
       for her upbringing at that time.


  The present refusal


   11. The application was refused in  the  decision  now  appealed  against
       because it was not accepted that there was sufficient  evidence  that
       the Sponsor took a significant role in  the  Appellant's  upbringing;
       the evidence of communications between them was  considered  limited,
       and photographs supplied were undated. It was not accepted  that  the
       Appellant's present living arrangements were dangerous or precarious.
       The decision was maintained  following  the  receipt  of  grounds  of
       appeal, an updated explanatory statement of July 2016 concluding that
       now the Appellant's need for  parental  care  was  lessening  as  she
       approached majority. The present appeal was allowed in a decision  by
       the First-tier Tribunal of 6 May 2017, but was subsequently  remitted
       for re-hearing.

The findings of the First-tier Tribunal below

   12. In its decision which forms the subject matter of this appeal to  the
       Upper Tribunal, the First-tier Tribunal accepted that  the  Appellant
       had established and  maintained  family  life  with  her  mother  and
       younger sister. She had lived with her present carer, [MM], for  some
       time, as there was nobody else who would  take  her  in.  Whilst  the
       separation of mother and daughter had justified  the  past  appellate
       findings of a lack of sole responsibility at the time they were made,
       since 2015 the Judge accepted that the Sponsor had now shown that she
       had  held  parental  responsibility  for  her;  she  had  chosen  her
       secondary school and guided her educational aspirations albeit within
       the context of her daughter making  the  final  choice  for  herself.
       Additionally the Sponsor had maintained  regular  contact  via  daily
       phone conversations and visited her six times since  herself  leaving
       Jamaica in 2001.

   13. A witness who  gave  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  Ms
       Osbourne, credibly stated their relationship appeared to  be  a  very
       close one, which was based not only on the word of  the  Sponsor  but
       also on her personal knowledge of the  relationship,  having  herself
       met the Appellant in Jamaica in 2016 and subsequently spoken  to  her
       by telephone.

   14. The Judge acknowledged the Home Office submission that the  provision
       of financial support did not itself show sole responsibility; however
       here it was apparent that the Sponsor had done all that she could  to
       support her daughter emotionally too. The Judge went on to accept her
       explanation that the delay in applying to bring her daughter  to  the
       UK between 2001 and 2008 was due to not understanding that she  could
       bring her here whilst a  student,  plus  problems  with  her  husband
       following their marriage in 2005.

   15. As to the question of serious and  compelling  reasons  demonstrating
       Miss [H]'s exclusion to be undesirable, the Sponsor's  evidence  that
       her father had left her whilst a baby had not  been  challenged;  she
       had no family in Jamaica to care for her. Her care arrangements  with
       Ms [MM] were only intended to be temporary.

   16. In conclusion, the First-tier Tribunal found that  the  Secretary  of
       State had failed to give the application  the  appropriate  care  and
       attention, particularly vis-ï¿½-vis Miss [H]'s  best  interests  having
       regard to the statutory duty to safeguard children and promote  their
       welfare. Balancing the competing interests, there would be no adverse
       impact on immigration control in allowing the daughter  to  join  her
       mother; accordingly the interference with family life  occasioned  by
       the refusal of entry clearance was disproportionate.

   17. On 12 October 2018 the Secretary of State lodged grounds of appeal to
       the Upper Tribunal against that decision, arguing that

        1) The "lower standard of proof" had been referenced at the outset
           of the decision;


        2) No adequate consideration had been given to the previous
           appellate findings;


        3) Whilst the First-tier Tribunal had effectively endorsed the
           earlier appellate findings, it had failed to consider that their
           plain implication was that the Sponsor had had no involvement in
           her daughter's upbringing until the latter was aged 17;


        4) No adequate reasons had been given for the finding, in the
           alternative to "sole responsibility", that there were "serious
           and compelling reasons" rendering the child's exclusion
           undesirable.

   18. Permission to appeal was granted on all those grounds by  the  First-
       tier Tribunal on 22 November 2018.


   19. Mr Tufan submitted  that  Devaseelan  applied;  negative  credibility
       findings had been made in earlier appeal proceedings, and they should
       have been treated as the  starting  point  for  subsequent  findings.
       Furthermore the wrong standard of proof had been applied, which was a
       threshold error that cast doubt on  all  the  findings  made  on  the
       appeal.

   20. Ms Bexson submitted that the Judge was clearly aware of  the  earlier
       decision from Judge Moore, but that she was nevertheless entitled  to
       reach a different decision on the evidence.

Findings and reasons

   21. It is expedient to address the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal
       in turn. It seems to me that each of the grounds has some force.


  Devaseelan - past findings on sole responsibility


   22.   The   Immigration   Directorate   Instructions   addressing    sole
       responsibility have consistently stated the following:

           "A parent claiming to have had 'sole responsibility' for a child
           must satisfactorily demonstrate that he has, usually for a
           substantial period of time, been the chief person exercising
           parental responsibility. For such an assertion to be accepted,
           it must be shown that he has had, and still has, the ultimate
           responsibility for the major decisions relating to the child's
           upbringing, and provides the child with the majority of the
           financial and emotional support he requires.


           ...


           There are a number of factors which should be taken into account
           when deciding whether, for the purpose of the Rules, a parent
           has established that he has had the "sole responsibility" for a
           child to the  exclusion of the other parent or those who may
           have been looking after the child. These may include:


           *  the period for which the parent in the United Kingdom has
           been separated from the child;


           *  what the arrangements were for the care of the child before
           that parent migrated to this country;


           *  who has been entrusted with day to day care and control of
           the child since the sponsoring parent migrated here;


           *  who provides, and in what proportion, the financial support
           for the child's care and upbringing;


           *  who takes the important decisions about the child's
           upbringing, such as where and with whom the child lives, the
           choice of school, religious practice etc;


           *  the degree of contact that has been maintained between the
           child and the parent claiming "sole responsibility";


           *  what part in the child's care and upbringing is played by the
           parent not in the United Kingdom and his relatives."

   23. As is explained in judgments such as  that  of  Buxton  LJ  in  Cenir
       [2003] EWCA Civ 572: "The general guidance is to look at whether what
       has been done in relation to the upbringing has been done  under  the
       direction of the sponsoring settled parent ... the importance of  the
       parent with responsibility, albeit at a distance, having what can  be
       identified as direction over or control of important decisions in the
       child's life." So the critical question on the appeal, as to  whether
       the Sponsor has sole responsibility,  is  a  question  of  fact,  and
       geographical  separation  from  her  daughter  is  of  only   limited
       relevance. The  Respondent's  IDI  is  helpful  in  giving  practical
       examples of what factors might be relevant in the application of  the
       test. As noted by the Deputy President in  TD  (Paragraph  297(i)(e):
       "sole responsibility") Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049: "13.A  central  part
       of the notion of "sole responsibility" for a  child's  upbringing  is
       the UK-based parent's continuing  interest  and  involvement  in  the
       child's life, including making or being consulted about and approving
       important decisions about the child's upbringing." Referring to Nmaju
       [2001] INLR 26, the TD Yemen Tribunal went on to state at [30]:  "The
       Court of Appeal saw "sole responsibility" as a practical (rather than
       exclusively legal) exercise of "control" by the UK-based parent  over
       the child's upbringing and whether what is done by the carer is  done
       "under the direction" of that parent."


   24. As indicated by Mundeba [2013] UKUT 88 (IAC), citing Article 3 of the
       Convention on the Rights of the Child which Home  Office  policy  has
       long made central to immigration decision making: "An entry clearance
       decision for the  admission  of  a  child  under  18  is  "an  action
       concerning children...undertaken by...administrative authorities" and
       so by Article 3 "the best interests of the child shall be  a  primary
       consideration".


   25. Where there has been a prior judicial determination on the issues  in
       the appeal, that assessment represents the  starting  point  for  the
       subsequent appeal as set out in Devaseelan (D  (Tamil)  [2002]  UKIAT
       00702):  in  short  the  prior  determination  is  the  authoritative
       historic resolution of the case. A Judge is entitled to take  account
       of subsequent facts,  though  they  should  treat  the  adduction  of
       further  evidence   relating   to   the   historic   situation   with
       circumspection.


   26. Here, the First-tier Tribunal's focus was on the arrangements for the
       Sponsor's daughter's upbringing in recent  years,  particularly  from
       2015 onwards. The  Judge's  reasoning  is  very  concise.  The  legal
       framework that it needed to engage with is as set out above.  So  far
       as it goes, the Judge's reasoning was consistent  with  the  guidance
       found  therein.  However,  whilst  brevity  of   reasoning   is   not
       necessarily a bad thing, here it was necessary to address two issues:
       that assertions of fact emanating from  the  Sponsor  had  previously
       been rejected on appeal, and that any period of  sole  responsibility
       was for a relatively short period, for only the final  year  of  Miss
       [H]'s minority.


   27. It seems to me that more detailed  reasons  were  needed  than  those
       provided to address the Secretary of State's case on these issues. It
       is not possible from the reasoning expressed  to  determine  why  the
       Home Office refusal reasons were rejected. It is  perfectly  possible
       that a Sponsor may demonstrate  sole  responsibility  over  a  recent
       period of time whilst not having done so in  the  past.  But  such  a
       finding has to engage with the relevant backdrop.


  Standard of proof


   28. At the outset of the conclusions  on  this  appeal,  and  before  the
       factual findings  were  made,  the  Judge  stated  "In  human  rights
       appeals, the burden of proof is on the  appellant,  the  standard  of
       proof is lower than the normal civil standard ..."


   29. Of course, in reality the standard of proof for appeals brought other
       than on protection grounds is the balance of probabilities.  This  is
       the case notwithstanding that the  relevant  events  may  have  taken
       place abroad. One can  readily  envisage  an  entry  clearance  "sole
       responsibility" case where the standard of proof is  not  necessarily
       determinative of the appeal's outcome, because the  background  facts
       are not contested.  However,  here  the  extent  of  the  Appellant's
       involvement with her daughter's upbringing had been challenged by the
       Respondent in the refusal  letter,  and  had  additionally  been  the
       subject of the adverse judicial decisions just referenced above.


   30. A generalised misdirection as to the standard of proof is  likely  to
       permeate the entirety of the factual findings on  an  appeal,  unless
       there is some overt indication within the fact-finding elsewhere that
       the appropriate standard was applied. There  is  no  such  indication
       within the remainder of the decision.


  Serious considerations rendering exclusion undesirable


   31. The  other  issue  that  arose  was  whether  there  were  compelling
       considerations making  the  Appellant's  exclusion  undesirable.  The
       Secretary of State's statement of policy in SET 7.9  set  out  in  SG
       (child of polygamous marriage) Nepal [2012] UKUT 265 (IAC) which sets
       out, as relevant considerations in the enquiry to be undertaken:

           "The ECO should consider all the evidence as a whole, deciding
           each application on its merits:


           ï¿½   Are the circumstances surrounding the child exceptional in
           relation to those of other children living in that same country?




           ï¿½   Are there emotional/physical factors relating to the
           sponsoring parent in the United Kingdom?


           ï¿½   Are there mental/physical factors relating to the non-
           sponsoring parent? Where the physical/mental incapability of the
           non-sponsoring parent has been established, an entry clearance
           should normally be granted.


           But not considered acceptable as a serious and compelling reason
           under this provision:


           ï¿½   that the UK offered a higher standard of living than in the
           child's own country".

   32. That gives an accurate prï¿½cis of the relevant considerations,  though
       of  course  guidance  cannot  replace  the   terms   of   the   Rule.
       Unfortunately, the First-tier Tribunal conducted no detailed  enquiry
       into the circumstances of Ms [H], and as to whether  any  alternative
       accommodation would be available to  her  (given,  for  example,  the
       reference to extended family in Jamaica in  Judge  Moore's  decision,
       and having regard  to  the  fact  that  subsequent  events  have  not
       suggested that her welfare was seriously endangered at the  date  the
       application  was  made).  Its  reasoning  is  not  sufficient  for  a
       sustainable finding on this issue, given  it  was  contested  by  the
       Secretary of State.


  Conclusion


   33. Unfortunately, notwithstanding the long history of these proceedings,
       there being material errors of law in the decision below, the  matter
       must be re-heard. Given that all findings will have to be re-assessed
       by reference to the appropriate standard of proof, this requires  re-
       hearing afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.


   34. Any future hearing of the appeal should bear in mind that  the  Rules
       effectively stop the clock in terms of  an  Appellant's  age  at  the
       application date (here the Appellant was around seventeen and a  half
       years of age at that point), a consideration which must  be  relevant
       in so far as the Rules are a  relevant  benchmark  against  which  to
       assess human rights considerations. This does not mean that  a  Judge
       should ignore post-application developments that shed  light  on  the
       situation  appertaining  previously,  but  it  does  mean  that   the
       Appellant's case on sole responsibility should  be  assessed  on  the
       basis that she was a child when she applied to join her mother.

Decision

The appeal is allowed to  the  extent  it  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for hearing afresh.
