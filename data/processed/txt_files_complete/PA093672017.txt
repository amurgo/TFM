Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Bond, Counsel instructed by Freemans Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       1. The appellant is a Rwandan national born on 22 February  1992.  He
          is the subject of a  deportation  order  made  against  him  under
          s.32(5) of the 2007 Act on 15 October  2014  and  he  appeals  the
          refusal of his protection and human rights claim.


       2. The appeal was heard by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rowlands  at
          Harmondsworth on 23 November  2017  and  dismissed  by  way  of  a
          determination promulgated on 12 December 2017.   On 1 March  2018,
          following  a  hearing  on  26  February  2018,  I  set  aside  the
          determination in so far as it related to article 8.  Full  reasons
          are provided in my determination of that date but essentially, the
          difficulty with the determination was that the judge made no clear
          findings on the issues of lawful residence,  social  and  cultural
          integration and whether there would be significant  obstacles  for
          the appellant on re-integration to the  home  country.  There  was
          also no meaningful examination of the circumstances the  appellant
          would face if deported to Rwanda.



      The Hearing



       3. The appellant was produced for the hearing. He gave  his  evidence
          in English. He confirmed the contents of his witness statement and
          said he had no family in Rwanda and was not in contact with anyone
          there. The appellant said he had no passport; he had lost  it  and
          had not applied for a new one. He had not been in contact with the
          Rwandan authorities in the UK at any time but he  was  aware  that
          the respondent had been.



       4. Mr Wilding then cross  examined  the  appellant.  In  response  to
          questions put to him, the  appellant  said  that  if  released  he
          wanted to undertake "youth work". He  was  asked  if  he  had  any
          qualifications and he said he had. He had decided to work in  this
          area when he was 18 and he obtained his qualifications at the  age
          of 22 (he was now 26). He said he had been in  prison  because  he
          made the wrong choices. He had wanted to start work when  he  came
          out of prison before but he was not allowed to work.



       5. The appellant said that he had not thought about working in hotels
          or restaurants in Rwanda. He had not  undertaken  any  courses  in
          prison as there was nothing there  to  help  him  in  the  way  of
          rehabilitation. He said he needed to  obtain  some  experience  by
          volunteering. He had been to a youth  club  in  Brixton  and  they
          helped him. That completed cross examination.



       6.  In  re-examination.  Ms  Bond  referred  the  appellant  to   the
          certificates in his bundle. He was silent.



       7. In response to questions I put for  clarification,  the  appellant
          said that he could not recall when he had lost  his  passport.  It
          may have been when he was 17 or 18. It was a Rwandan passport  and
          was the only one he had ever had. His father probably obtained  it
          for him. When asked what  qualifications  the  appellant  had  for
          youth work, he replied he had a level 1  qualification  in  Maths,
          English and construction. He had undertaken a  three-month  course
          in Brixton in  which  he  had  been  required  to  organise  daily
          activities for children aged 8-16 and plan day trips. He said  his
          convictions would not prevent  him  from  working  with  children.
          Those were my questions. Neither party had any questions arising.



       8. I then heard evidence from the appellant's twin  brother,  Gerald.
          He was asked how he would support his brother and he replied  that
          he would be there for him. He said he worked  in  the  scaffolding
          industry and could always obtain employment for him, even with his
          criminal record. He said that he was in the process of looking for
          housing and the appellant could live with him.



       9. The witness said he did not have  a  passport.  His  passport  had
          expired and he applied in 2012 for a new one at  the  Embassy  for
          himself and his brother but these were refused because of the lack
          of information about their birth place and date. He said he had no
          family that he knew of in Rwanda  and  was  not  in  contact  with
          anyone there.



      10. In cross examination the witness said that his brother  had  lived
          with him in the past. He could not remember when but they had been
          living together at the time of the applicant's last arrest. It was
          pointed out to him that he had not been a good  influence  on  the
          appellant previously and he was asked why that should be different
          now. The witness said he would be living in a different area where
          the appellant would not be in contact with  his  old  friends  who
          were in the Clapham Junction area. When it was  put  to  him  that
          that was close to Brixton where the appellant wanted to  work,  he
          replied that most of the friends had been arrested and so were not
          in the vicinity.  The  witness  was  looking  for  housing  around
          Croydon and Romford. Nothing had been agreed yet. He said that  if
          the appellant could work, that would help as before money  was  an
          issue  because  the  appellant  was  not  allowed  to   work.   He
          acknowledged that the appellant would have a problem finding  work
          with children because of his criminal record.



      11. The witness stated that they last heard from their father after he
          had returned to Rwanda in 2010-2011. He said he might still be  in
          Rwanda. They did not know. He was asked why his  step  mother  had
          not put in evidence in support of the appeal. The witness  replied
          it was difficult for her because she had young children. She  had,
          however, agreed to support him from "outside".



      12. In re-examination, the witness said his step mother was Ugandan.



      13. I then asked  the  witness  why,  if  he  and  the  appellant  had
          discussed the plan of employment in  the  building  industry,  the
          appellant had failed to mention it in his  evidence.  The  witness
          replied that it would be good for him if he did find  social  work
          but otherwise he could get work in scaffolding.  He  said  he  had
          never had problems  with  the  police.  There  were  no  questions
          arising. That completed the oral evidence.



      14. I then heard submissions. Mr Wilding relied on the refusal  letter
          and submitted that the appellant could not establish that  he  met
          the requirements of paragraph 399A. Whilst the respondent accepted
          that the appellant had been lawfully resident in the  UK,  it  was
          not accepted that he had been socially and  culturally  integrated
          or that there would be very significant obstacles on return. Given
          the duration of his criminal offending, it was difficult  for  him
          to show integration. His offending was not localised;  there  were
          instances  of  offending  in  Swindon  and  Exeter.  He   had   14
          convictions from 23 offences since 2008. There was  little  to  no
          evidence of his social and cultural integration, other  than  that
          he had been to school. There was little evidence from  family  and
          friends. Life would be difficult for him in Rwanda  but  he  could
          obtain employment there. If he could work in construction here, he
          could undertake similar work in Rwanda. English was spoken  there.
          There were no very significant obstacles to return. He would  face
          similar difficulties in starting up wherever he went.



      15. Mr Wilding submitted that it could not be pre-empted that he would
          not be able to obtain a passport. In any event, that was a  matter
          for the Secretary of State and not for  the  Tribunal.  There  was
          significant public interest in his  deportation.  His  criminality
          had escalated from minor offending. Whilst his brother may want to
          help him stay out of trouble, he  had  not  been  able  to  do  so
          before. The appellant's plans of youth work were no  more  than  a
          pipe dream. There was no evidence of any attempts he had made. His
          plan to work in the Brixton area would mean he  was  back  in  the
          area where he had previously been in trouble. The  appellant  made
          no mention of his brother's plan to find him  work  when  he  gave
          evidence and one wondered whether he had any  real  intentions  of
          taking on such work.  I  was  asked  to  consider  the  sentencing
          remarks and to dismiss the appeal.



      16. Ms Bond relied on the determination of Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ  813
          and asked that I make a broad and evaluative judgment and consider
          whether the appellant would be an outsider on return or enough  of
          an insider to integrate. He had left Rwanda at the age of nine and
          had no family and  no  contact  with  anyone  there.  The  Rwandan
          authorities had not accepted that he was a  Rwandan  national  and
          his nationality could not  be  verified.  His  brother  had  given
          evidence that their applications to renew their passports had been
          refused. The appellant was not removable.  That  was  a  matter  I
          could take into account. The appellant could not  be  expected  to
          integrate into Rwanda if it was not accepted that he was  Rwandan.
          The appeal should  be  allowed  on  that  basis.  His  history  of
          offending was shocking but he had his brother's help now.



      17. That completed the hearing. I reserved my  determination  which  I
          now give with reasons.








      Discussion and Conclusions


      18. I have carefully considered all the evidence  as  a  whole  before
          reaching any conclusions. The reasons set out below are not  given
          in any order of priority.



      19. The issues for consideration are  (1)  whether  the  appellant  is
          socially and culturally integrated in the UK,  it  being  accepted
          that he had been lawfully resident  here  for  most  of  his  life
          (s.117C(4)(a)  and  (b)  and  paragraph  399A),  (2)  whether  the
          appellant could integrate into Rwandan society  (s.117C(4)(c)  and
          399A) and (3) whether  there  are  any  exceptional  circumstances
          justifying a grant  of  leave  outside  the  rules  on  article  8
          grounds.



      20. It is necessary to first set out the law in this case.



      21. S. 117C pertains to the article 8 claims of foreign criminals.  It
          provides:
   1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.

   2) The more serious the offence committed by the foreign national, the
      greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

   3) In the case of a foreign criminal (C) who has not been sentenced to a
      period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest
      requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.

   4) Exception 1 applies where -

   a) C has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of C's life

   b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the UK, and

   c) There would be very significant obstacles to C's integration into the
      country to which C is proposed to be deported.

                ..........................................

          (7) The considerations in sub sections (1) - (6) are to  be  taken
          into                                                       account

                                           where  a  court  or  Tribunal  is
          considering a decision to deport a foreign criminal  only  to  the
          extent that the  reason  for  the  decision  was  the  offence  or
          offences for which the criminal has been convicted.


      22.  Paragraph  397  of  the  Immigration  Rules  provides   that:   A
          deportation order  will  not  be  made  if  the  person's  removal
          pursuant to the order would be contrary to  the  UK's  obligations
          under the Refugee Convention or the Human Rights Convention.


      23. Paragraph 398 states: Where a person claims that their deportation
          would be contrary to the UK's obligations under article 8  of  the
          Human Rights Convention, and............... (b) the deportation of
          the person is conducive to the public  good  [and  in  the  public
          interest] because they have been convicted of an offence for which
          they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less  than
          4 years but at least 12 months ...... the Secretary  of  State  in
          assessing that claim will consider whether paragraph 399  or  399A
          apples and, if it does not, the  public  interest  in  deportation
          will only be outweighed by other  factors  where  there  are  very
          compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described   in
          paragraph 399 and 399A.



      24. Paragraph 399 does not apply here as the appellant does not have a
          partner or a child. Paragraph 399A applies where paragraph  398(b)
          or (c) applies if - (a) the person has been lawfully  resident  in
          the UK for most of his life; and (b) he is socially and culturally
          integrated in the UK; and (c)  there  would  be  very  significant
          obstacles to his integration into  the  country  to  which  it  is
          proposed he is deported.



      25. Certain judgments were referred  to  in  submissions  and  in  the
          evidence. I have considered these. I consider in particular  those
          where the principles particularly appertain to the appellant.  The
          case of Kamara [2018] EWCA Civ  813  concerned  a  Sierra  Leonean
          national who had come to the UK aged 6,  was  convicted  of  drugs
          offences, sentenced  to  over  4  years  in  prison  and  faced  a
          deportation order. In considering s.117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A,
          the court found that the concept of integration into  the  country
          of origin "is a broad one...not confined to the  mere  ability  to
          find a job or to sustain life". It held: "The idea of  integration
          calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be made  as  to   whether
          the  individual  will  be  enough  of  an  insider  in  terms   of
          understanding how life in the society in that country  is  carried
          out and a capacity to participate in it so as to have a reasonable
          opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate on a  day-
          to-day basis in that society and to build up within  a  reasonable
          time a variety of human relationships to  give  substance  to  the
          individual's private or family life" (at 14).



      26. In MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 it was held that:  "where  the
          relevant group of Immigration Rules upon their proper construction
          provide a complete code for dealing  with  a  person's  Convention
          rights  in  the  context  of  a  particular  immigration  rule  or
          statutory provision such as in the case of foreign criminals, then
          the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to  be
          taken  into  account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
          accordance with that  code,  although  references  to  exceptional
          circumstances   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
          proportionality exercise" (at 134).



      27. In PF (Nigeria) [2015] EWCA Civ 251,  the  court  noted  that  the
          consideration of whether there were  very  compelling  reasons  to
          outweigh the public interest in deportation had to  be  undertaken
          where paragraph 399 and 399A did not apply (at 43).



      28. There is reference in the First-tier Tribunal determination to the
          case of Nididi v the United Kingdom (application no. 41215/14),  a
          Nigerian national who came to the UK aged two with his mother, who
          subsequently obtained indefinite leave to remain and had  a  child
          but who faced deportation on account of an escalating  history  of
          criminal offending including robbery, assault, burglary and drugs.
          Some of his offending had been committed whilst he was a minor. He
          had received a sentence of over 4 years'  in  a  young  offenders'
          institution.  The  court  found  that  notwithstanding  his   long
          residence and family ties in the UK, deportation was justified.



      29.  It is also necessary to set out the appellant's background,  both
          in  terms  of  his  immigration  history  and   his   criminality.
          Regrettably, the chronology contained in  the  appellant's  bundle
          omits all offending between 2008 and 2013.



      30. The appellant entered the UK  in  September  2001  with  his  twin
          brother and their father. Asylum applications were made  for  them
          by their father on 2 November 2001 but  refused  in  January  2002
          because the respondent considered there was no  Convention  reason
          engaged  but  he  (and  presumably  his  brother)   were   granted
          exceptional  leave  to  remain  until  August  2003  followed   by
          indefinite leave to remain the same month as dependants  of  their
          father  who  had  made  the  application  and  who  also  received
          indefinite leave to remain. It is not the case, as claimed by  the
          solicitors at R2, that they had been granted asylum.



      31. In May 2005 the appellant was  refused  registration  for  British
          citizenship on the basis that neither of his parents was a British
          citizen. His father's application was refused on the basis that he
          had exceeded the permitted limit of absences from the UK.



      32. On 25 March 2008  at  Balham  Juvenile  Court  the  appellant  was
          convicted of robbery and sentenced  to  a  referral  order  for  9
          months.



      33. On 5 August 2008 the order was revoked by the same court  and  the
          appellant was convicted  of  burglary  and  theft  (dwelling)  and
          sentenced to a Supervision Order for 12 months and a curfew  order
          for 3 months which included electronic tagging.



      34. On 17 March 2009, the appellant was convicted, again at Balham, of
          breaching his Supervision Order and an  order  was  made  for  the
          original sentence to continue.



      35. On 2 September 2009, the appellant  was  convicted  at  Balham  of
          disorderly behaviour or using threatening/abusive/insulting  words
          likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress and fined �50.



      36. On 14 January 2010, the appellant was convicted at Balham of using
          disorderly behaviour or threatening/abusive/insulting words likely
          to cause harassment, alarm or distress and destroying or  damaging
          property. He was sentenced to two Youth Rehabilitation Orders with
          an unpaid work requirement of 40 hours each.



      37. On 11 February 2010, the  appellant  was  convicted  at  Wimbledon
          Magistrates' Court of handling stolen goods  and  sentenced  to  a
          Youth Rehabilitation Order and Curfew Order for one month.



      38. On 6 July 2010, the  appellant  was  convicted  at  South  Western
          Magistrates' Court of three  counts  of  attempted  burglary  with
          intent to steal and sentenced to a Community Order with an  Unpaid
          Work Requirement (UWR) of 120 hours on each count.



      39. On 29 November 2010, the appellant was convicted at South  Western
          Magistrates Court of failing to comply with the requirements of  a
          community order and an Order was made for the original sentence to
          continue and a UWR of  10  hours  consecutive  was  added  to  the
          original sentence.



      40. On 10 January  2013,  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  Richmond
          Magistrates' Court of travelling on the railway without paying the
          fare.



      41. On 19 July 2013, the appellant was convicted at Exeter Crown Court
          of handling stolen goods. He received a suspended prison  sentence
          for 12 months, suspended for 24 months, a Supervision  Requirement
          for 12 months, a Programme Requirement to participate in  Thinking
          Skills and costs of �150.



      42. On 25 September 2013, the appellant was convicted at  North  Essex
          Magistrates' Court of possession of a controlled  drug  (Class  B)
          and commission of a further offence during the operational  period
          of a suspended sentence order. He was ordered to pay costs of �85,
          forfeiture of drugs and one day  in  detention  in  lieu  of  non-
          payment.



      43. On 26 December 2013, the appellant was convicted at Central  Devon
          Magistrates' Court of two counts of possessing a controlled drug -
          Class A - with intent to supply (crack  cocaine  and  heroin)  and
          breaching a suspended sentence.



      44. On 23 January 2014, he was sentenced at Exeter Crown  Court  to  2
          years' imprisonment for possession of Class A drugs with intent to
          supply and  sentenced  to  two  years  in  prison  consecutive  to
          activation of a suspended 9 month sentence and one concurrent term
          of 2 years in prison was activated consecutively.
      45. It was following this conviction that the appellant was, in  April
          2014, notified of  the  decision  to  deport.  He  responded  with
          representations relying on his family life with a partner but  the
          deportation order  was  signed  on  10  October  2014.  The  s.94B
          certified decision  was  later  withdrawn  following  the  Supreme
          Court's judgment in Kiarie and Byndloss on 14 June 2017.



      46.  On  12   November   2014,   the   appellant   submitted   further
          representations which were considered as a fresh application under
          paragraph 353 and refused on 26 June 2015.



      47. On 31 July 2015, bio-data and supporting documents were  forwarded
          to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to obtain  verification  of
          the appellant's nationality from the Rwandan authorities.



      48. On 7 August 2015, the appellant was placed on remand for a further
          offence of control of  criminal  property  and  given  a  6  month
          sentence on 8 January 2016.



      49.  On  25  February  2016,  the  Rwandan  authorities  notified  the
          respondent that they could not verify the appellant's nationality.





      50.  In  March  2016  the  appellant  was  released  from  immigration
          detention following a successful bail application.



      51. On 17 May 2016, representations were made on asylum grounds to the
          respondent.



      52. On 29 July 2016, the appellant was arrested and on 26 August  2016
          at Swindon Crown Court, he was convicted of possession of Class  A
          drugs with intent to supply,  possession  of  Class  B  drugs  and
          possession of criminal property.  He  received  a  2  year  prison
          sentence.



      53. On 11 August 2017, a section 72 notice was served on the appellant
          and he responded on 25  August  2017.  His  protection  and  human
          rights claims were refused on  12  September  2017  when  a  fresh
          deportation order with an in country right of appeal was issued.


      54. Between March 2008 and August 2016, the appellant amassed some  14
          convictions for 23 offences.



      55. I have taken full account  of  the  supporting  evidence.  In  his
          witness statement of 8 October 2017, prepared for  the  First-tier
          Tribunal hearing (and adopted  at  that  hearing),  the  appellant
          confirmed that he entered the UK with his brother and father, that
          he settled with his step mother  in  Battersea,  attended  school,
          obtained 6 GCSEs and a performing arts diploma after  three  years
          at  college  (although   no   evidence   in   support   of   those
          qualifications has been adduced). Whilst at college, he  had  part
          time work at Homebase, undertook work experience  at  Primark  and
          volunteered at Knights Youth Club in Brixton Hill.  The  appellant
          stated that he would be a stranger in Rwanda, he did not speak the
          language and had no one left there. He feared he  would  become  a
          victim of genocide as his mother had been. He had  no  friends  or
          family there. He states that he never heard from or saw his father
          after he separated from the appellant's step mother. She continued
          to look after him although kicked him out of the house when he was
          14 because he  "was  out  of  control".  He  had  started  smoking
          cannabis, using  crack  cocaine,  missing  school  and  committing
          crimes. When he was put in prison, he states that he began to take
          courses to help him on release. He took painting  and  decorating,
          tiling, cleaning  and  gym  courses  and  also  attended  a  drugs
          awareness course. He stated that  he  realised  his  mistakes  and
          wanted to show he could be a better person. He stated he wanted to
          be a youth worker. He wanted to  start  a  family  life  with  his
          partner. His support network was here. He  would  die  if  removed
          because his life would be in danger. He regretted his  past  wrong
          doing.


      56. The appellant has  adduced  copies  of  a  Cleaning  Professionals
          Skills Suite certificate issued in June  2017,  Stop  Drug  supply
          certificate issued 10 July 2017, PS  Awareness  Group  certificate
          issued 21 April 2017, OCR Level 1 in English (20 March 2017),  OCR
          Level 1 in IT (3 January 2017), City and Guilds certificate  Level
          1 in English (21 February  2017),  City  and  Guilds  Level  1  in
          construction skills - wall and floor  tiling  (26  January  2017),
          City and Guilds Level 1 in  Painting  and  decorating  (5  January
          2017), Pearson Edexcel  Functional  Skills  in  Mathematics  Level
          Entry 3 (April 2017) and  certificates  issued  by  Inclusion  for
          completing workshops on  Managing  Emotions  (1  September  2016),
          Cannabis group (23 November 2016) and Mindfulness  and  Relaxation
          (4 October 2016). The certificates  are  all  issued  to  a  David
          GATSIZI rather than Gatsinzi but I take no issue with that.


      57. I have  considered  a  statement  from  the  appellant's  brother,
          Gerald, dated 24  October  2017.  He  states  that  the  appellant
          realises  he  has  made  mistakes  and  has  to  change.  He  took
          educational courses  in  prison  and  sought  help  for  his  drug
          addiction. They have no family in Rwanda. The appellant  wants  to
          start a new life with his partner and give his children  the  life
          he never had. He wants to work and contribute to society.



      58.  Assessing  the  evidence  before  me,  I  find  that  the  it  is
          contradictory in many respects.  The  asylum  application  at  A2,
          presumably completed on the appellant's behalf and signed  by  his
          father as guardian, provided information that  the  appellant  had
          never held a Rwandan passport but his evidence to me was  that  he
          had had one but had lost it. His  brother  said  his  had  expired
          which further indicates  that  the  brothers  had  passports.  The
          appellant made no mention  of  his  brother  seeking  to  get  new
          passports for both of them. There are  also  contradictions  about
          how the appellant came to the UK. His evidence and the evidence of
          his brother was that they  had  arrived  with  their  father.  The
          asylum application maintains the  appellant  came  with  an  agent
          arranged by his grandmother to join his father (A2  and  A4).  The
          appellant maintained in evidence  to  me  and  to  the  First-tier
          Tribunal Judge that he did not know where he lived or where he was
          born  but  he  has  provided  a  date  of  birth  throughout   the
          proceedings and was said to have a birth certificate  which  would
          have information about his place of birth (at A2). There  is  also
          information  about  his  residence  in  Kigali   in   the   asylum
          application. Whilst his brother claimed one of the  problems  with
          getting new passports was that they did not know  when  they  were
          born, they have both supplied a date of birth  to  the  respondent
          and the Tribunal. In his representations to  the  respondent,  the
          appellant maintained that he only had his father  and  brother  in
          Rwanda after his mother died when  he  was  very  young  (N7)  but
          details of two other brothers and a sister in Rwanda are  provided
          in  the  asylum  interview  (A3).  The  appellant's  brother  gave
          evidence that their father had returned to Rwanda in 2010-2011 and
          that they had spoken to him  once  thereafter  but  the  appellant
          maintained, in June 2017, that he did not know if his  father  had
          returned there (N10) and that he had  not  had  contact  with  him
          after he left the family home in 2006 (statement).



  59. The appellant relied heavily in his representations to the  respondent
      (in August 2014 and 2017) and in his witness statement for his  appeal
      before the First-tier Tribunal (as did his brother) on a  relationship
      with a woman he intended to marry after his release from prison but at
      his hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  in  November  2017,
      just a few weeks after the witness statement had  been  prepared,  the
      relationship was said to have come to an end (at paragraph  6  of  the
      determination).




  60. There is a reference in the respondent's  evidence  (10  October  2014
      letter) of the appellant's father being granted  indefinite  leave  to
      remain; in those circumstances it is puzzling that he should have been
      removed but I have been given no evidence on that. It is also the case
      that he was  refused  British  citizenship  in  2006  because  he  had
      exceeded the permitted limit of absences from the UK (ibid).   I  have
      no information as to where he travelled.




  61. The appellant asks for a second chance to show that he has turned  his
      life around after his long and sorry history of criminality  which  he
      acknowledges is a poor one. The difficulty I have is that this is  not
      the first time he has made such a plea. In the past he made  much  the
      same promise to the Secretary  of  State  in  his  representations  in
      November 2014 (H1-3) and in August 2015 (I1-2). Despite  promising  to
      keep out of trouble and not to continue re-offending, he was  back  in
      prison in August 2015 and in July 2016 (following convictions for four
      offences). This limits the weight that can be put upon his promises of
      good behaviour and assertions that he has learnt  from  his  mistakes.
      This is compounded by the fact that the  last  offence  was  committed
      whilst he was on bail and that he continued to re-offend even after he
      was notified of a decision to deport  in  April  2014  and  after  the
      deportation order was signed in October 2014. Indeed, he received  one
      of his longest prison sentences for his most recent  offence.  He  has
      also breached the terms  of  various  orders  and  committed  offences
      during the period of a suspended sentence. This does not show me  that
      he is sorry for his past behaviour or that he has made any  effort  to
      change his ways.  If  he  was  genuinely  sorry  and  sincere  in  his
      promises, then one would have expected no further offending after 2014
      when he first put his promises and pleas forward  to  the  respondent.
      The evidence also shows that he received two adjudications  whilst  in
      prison (at paragraph 5 of the determination). He maintains these  were
      for minor matters; no details are given, but nonetheless it shows that
      his behaviour is still problematic.




  62. I have taken into account the appellant's brother's assurances of help
      and support but these are of limited value. The appellant  was  living
      with his brother following an earlier prison sentence when he was  re-
      arrested and it is, therefore, clear that his brother had no influence
      over him previously. Why anything should be different now has not been
      explained.




  63. The appellant seeks to blame  part  of  his  offending  on  having  no
      income. The evidence is that during his life here, he  has  only  ever
      had a three-month part time job at Homebase whilst he was at  college.
      He admitted to the First-tier Tribunal Judge that  he  made  a  living
      through drug dealing (at paragraph 8). It remains a concern  that  the
      appellant would again turn to crime if he was short of funds. Although
      his brother gave evidence that he would be able to get him  employment
      in the scaffolding business,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence  to
      confirm this possibility. Nor was I reassured by his evidence that the
      appellant had agreed to such employment as the appellant himself  made
      no reference to any such work or of his brother's  offer  in  his  own
      evidence.  The appellant spoke only of his plan to seek youth work  at
      a youth club in Brixton but there is no  evidence  from  the  club  to
      confirm that they would be willing to employ him  given  his  criminal
      record (and I note that the appellant's brother himself raised this as
      a point against him in evidence) and, more importantly, I note that is
      the area where the appellant previously came  into  contact  with  the
      wrong crowd of friends. The appellant's  brother  stated  in  evidence
      that the appellant could live with him and that they would  be  living
      away from the Brixton/Clapham area however  he  has  no  accommodation
      lined up and the appellant's own evidence  suggests  that  he  has  no
      intention of staying away from that part of London.




  64. When sentencing the appellant in January 2014,  the  judge  noted  the
      appellant's  long  history  of  offending  and   the   escalation   in
      seriousness of his offences (E3). He noted  that  he  had  warned  the
      appellant of the  consequences  of  re-offending  during  a  suspended
      sentence, but that had not deterred the appellant  who  just  a  short
      time thereafter had been found in possession of cannabis and was  then
      re-arrested. Despite receiving a prison sentence  of  2  years  and  9
      months, and professing to have learnt his lesson whilst  incarcerated,
      the appellant continued  with  his  heroin  and  cocaine  dealing  and
      received a 2-year sentence in August 2016 for Class  A  drug  dealing,
      possession of criminal property, possession of cannabis and assaulting
      a police officer.  That  sentence  took  account  of  the  appellant's
      professed difficulties in life but the appellant  cannot  continue  to
      blame his own appalling behaviour on others such as his father. Whilst
      the evidence was that now he faced deportation, he  had  realised  the
      error of his ways and would make good, the fact remains that that  was
      also the situation back in 2014 when the deportation order  was  first
      signed. It did not stop his criminal behaviour then and  the  evidence
      does not indicate that it is any different now.




  65. I note the courses the appellant undertook in prison but his  evidence
      did not suggest that he intended to make use of any of  them  to  find
      work; eg, in painting and decorating,  tiling,  cleaning  or  that  he
      planned any further education.




  66. I find it of concern that the appellant's step mother who is  said  to
      be willing to support him has not taken any  steps  to  confirm  that,
      either by attending this or the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal
      or to have at least put forward a written statement. I fail to see how
      having young children would make it impossible for her  to  prepare  a
      letter of support. This  is  despite  the  fact  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge commented on the absence of  any  written  support  (at
      paragraph 9). There is no suggestion that she has been in contact with
      the appellant or that she has visited him  in  prison  or  immigration
      detention nor are there any letters of support  from  her.  I  do  not
      consider that it has been shown that  the  appellant  can  expect  any
      support from her nor do I find that the evidence shows that  there  is
      any kind of subsisting relationship between the appellant and her  and
      her children (of whom no details have been provided). It was  not  the
      appellant's brother's evidence  that  he  had  any  contact  with  her
      either.




  67. I have seen no other evidence of support. There is  nothing  from  the
      Youth Club where the appellant claimed to have undertaken some kind of
      volunteer work. There is no evidence to suggest they would be  willing
      to have him back there or that they could offer  him  voluntary  work.
      There is nothing from the appellant's brother's employer to show  work
      is available or would be  offered  to  the  appellant.   There  is  no
      evidence of where the appellant would live if released from detention.
      There is no evidence from the prison authorities or from  a  probation
      officer. There is no OASys report. Indeed, the evidence is very sparse
      indeed. The appellant's own  oral  and  written  evidence  aside,  the
      supporting evidence consists essentially of  his  brother's  statement
      and the appellant's certificates.




  68. It is in the context of all this evidence, the case law  (specifically
      the "broad evaluative judgment" exhorted in Kamara), the rules and the
      difficulties highlighted  above  that  I  must  consider  whether  the
      appellant should be deported. Exception 1 in  s.117C(4)  puts  forward
      three requirements: for the individual to have been lawfully  resident
      in the UK for  most  of  his  life,  to  be  socially  and  culturally
      integrated  and  for  there  to  be  very  significant  obstacles   to
      integration into the proposed country of return. This is  incorporated
      into the Immigration Rules at paragraph 399A.




  69. Although it is unclear whether "most of one's life" means having spent
      more time in the UK than outside it or something else entirely, it  is
      accepted by Mr Wilding that this requirement  is  met.  I  do  not  go
      behind it. Turning then to the second issue, I find that  having  been
      to school here, having lived here since childhood and being fluent  in
      English, the appellant is culturally integrated.  The same  cannot  be
      said,  however,  for  social  integration.  The  only  connection  the
      appellant has here is his brother. He has no  employment  history,  no
      subsisting friendships, no family life of any kind  and,  regrettably,
      his private life appears to have been one which revolved around crime.
      He has spent long periods in prison and has been the subject  of  many
      other non-custodial sentences. He has  not  shown  that  he  was  ever
      financially independent or that he ever contributed  to  the  economic
      well-being  of  this  country  or  indeed  that  he   has   positively
      contributed in any way. This does not show  a  social  integration  at
      all; indeed, it demonstrates the very opposite. The appellant  appears
      to have turned his back on society. Nothing in the  evidence  suggests
      to me that the appellant has socially integrated into the community in
      a positive way.




  70. With respect to the situation in Rwanda, I consider that the truth has
      not been told.  The appellant's father would appear to  have  returned
      there and from the papers before me there  are  three  other  siblings
      there. The appellant has not been candid about this  in  his  evidence
      and that gives rise to concern over his claim to have no contact  with
      anyone there. I also note that an interpreter in "Kinya" was requested
      at the asylum interview (A7). I can safely assume that Kinya refers to
      Kinyarwanda, the main language spoken in Rwanda. If this was  for  the
      appellant's father then it indicates that was his mother tongue and it
      is not credible that the appellant would not have been speaking it  as
      his only language when he arrived here  or  that  he  would  not  have
      continued using it with his father, even if it was infrequently, until
      his father left. In those circumstances it is difficult to accept that
      he now has no knowledge at all of the language. It may be rusty but he
      should have some memory of it. Additionally, I note from the  evidence
      that English is also used  in  Rwanda.  I  accept  that  it  would  be
      difficult for the appellant to return and to resume his life in Rwanda
      but I do not find that there would be very  significant  obstacles  to
      his re-integration. He could make contact  with  his  family,  if  not
      already in contact and he could look for employment given that he  has
      a variety of skills. Plainly, he has made no attempt to undertake  any
      enquiries at all. He has no meaningful private  or  family  life  here
      (indeed no evidence of either  was  adduced)  so  there  would  be  no
      disruption to that and his intermittent contact with his  brother  and
      any contact that may exist with his  step-mother  could  be  continued
      from overseas.




  71. Ms Bond relied heavily on the refusal of the  Rwandan  authorities  to
      verify the appellant's nationality. That is, however, a matter for the
      respondent when it comes to removal. The appellant has had a  previous
      passport, by his own evidence, and he had a birth certificate  as  the
      evidence demonstrates.  The  authorities  should,  therefore,  have  a
      record of him. His brother's expired passport could also  be  produced
      to the authorities as further confirmation of his Rwandan connections.
      I note that although his brother stated the passport had  expired,  he
      did not claim that he had lost it. I have  seen  no  evidence  of  any
      attempt made by the brother to renew his passport nor any evidence  of
      the refusal to issue a  passport  to  him.  It  was  argued  that  the
      respondent was unsuccessful in her attempts to  have  his  nationality
      verified but I have no information as to what evidence  was  available
      to her at the time. She may be able to obtain information or  evidence
      from the appellant's father's file. He must  have  had  some  kind  of
      travel document for removal.  I  do  not,  therefore,  accept  that  a
      refusal to confirm the appellant's nationality is a relevant issue for
      consideration when assessing re-integration, however attractive it may
      appear.




  72.  I  conclude,  therefore,  that  the  appellant  does  not  meet   the
      requirements of the exceptions to deportation.




  73. I now consider whether there are any very compelling circumstances  as
      to why deportation should not go ahead. Clearly there is a significant
      public interest in  his  deportation  due  to  the  sheer  number  and
      seriousness of the offences committed and the persistence of offending
      over a number of years despite prison  sentences  and  the  threat  of
      deportation. The appellant must show a very strong article 8 claim  to
      overcome that hurdle and I regret to say that this has not been  done.
      His length of residence alone is insufficient  to  amount  to  a  very
      compelling circumstance and in this context I  note  the  judgment  in
      Ndidi where the European Court of Human Rights found that despite  the
      28 year residence of a Nigerian national in the UK (since his  arrival
      at the age of two), his  family  ties,  relationship  with  a  British
      national, the birth of a child, limited ties to his home  country  and
      no re-offending for a six year period, his deportation would not be in
      breach of article 8. Whilst that individual had received a more severe
      prison sentence than the appellant, he had been  in  the  UK  for  far
      longer and from a much younger age. He also had strong ties.  However,
      he too had been given many opportunities to change his  ways  but  had
      failed to avail himself of them. It was found that he was  of  an  age
      where he could cope with starting a new life. The same applies to  the
      appellant.




  74. The appellant's skeleton argument proceeds on the basis that in  order
      to succeed, the appellant has to show  very  compelling  circumstances
      over and above paragraph 398 and 399 and the exceptions in  s.117C(4).
      That suggests that it is accepted that the exceptions  do  not  apply.
      The submissions made in support of that test, as put in  the  skeleton
      argument and at the hearing, are:




  75. (1) that the appellant is not a serious  criminal  who  constitutes  a
      danger to the community,

          (2) that he came here as a child aged nine,

          (3) that he has had a troubled life since his father left home,

          (4) that freedom of speech or opposition to  the  regime  are  not
          tolerated in Rwanda,

          (5) that he has been lawfully resident in the UK for the  majority
          of his life,

          (6) that he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK,

          (7)  that  there  would  be  significant  obstacles  to  his   re-
          integration into Rwandan society,

          (8) that he has no links with family in Rwanda and no contact with
          his father since 2006,

          (9) that he would be an outsider on return,

          (10) that he does not have a capacity to  participate  in  society
          there,

          (11) that he would not be accepted and

          (12) that the authorities  have  not  accepted  he  is  a  Rwandan
          national.




  76. I have already addressed  these  points  above  but  to  summarise  my
      conclusions and taking each in turn I  make  the  following  comments.
      The appellant has shown by his own behaviour and crimes that he  is  a
      serious criminal and that given the escalation and persistence of  his
      offending, even whilst under threat of deportation, on bail and during
      a suspended sentence, the lack of any meaningful support  network  and
      the absence of any influence exerted over him by his brother or anyone
      else, he is a danger to the community.  It is accepted that he entered
      the UK aged nine and it is accepted  that  he  has  been  living  here
      lawfully since then until 2014 when the deportation order was  signed;
      however, as already considered above, that alone does not outweigh the
      public interest in his deportation (as per Ndidi). It is not clear why
      the appellant blames his father's departure from the family  home  for
      his criminality particularly when he appeared to have a secure home at
      the time with his step mother  and  when  his  twin  brother  has  not
      followed in his footsteps with a life of crime. The appellant has  not
      suggested that he has any political views and it has never  been  part
      of his case that he  would  wish  to  become  involved  in  opposition
      politics.  I  have  accepted  cultural  integration  but  not   social
      integration for the reasons given above.  The  submissions  failed  to
      engage with why it is asserted the appellant  is  socially  integrated
      given his behaviour. I accept it would be  difficult  to  re-integrate
      into Rwandan society after a long absence  but  I  consider  that  the
      appellant could reconnect with relatives and/or could be  expected  to
      manage on his own given his acquired skills,  good  health  and  young
      age. His brother, who has offered to help him, could  offer  financial
      assistance until he settles down. I do not accept the  account  of  no
      links with Rwanda given the inconsistent evidence identified  earlier.
      Nor do I accept there has been no contact with the appellant's  father
      since 2006 as the appellant's  brother's  evidence  contradicted  that
      claim. The appellant may feel an outsider at first but can be expected
      to adjust and integrate. It is not explained why he does not have  the
      capacity to participate in society  there  or  on  what  basis  it  is
      maintained that he would not be accepted. The issue of nationality  is
      a matter for the respondent on removal.  No other factors which  could
      constitute compelling circumstances have been put forward.

      77. The strongest and perhaps only point in the appellant's favour  is
          that he entered the UK at the age of nine and  has  been  lawfully
          resident here from then and up until the making of the deportation
          order. For all the reasons set out above, however, I do  not  find
          that that outweighs the strong public interest in his deportation.



      Decision



      78. The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.


      Anonymity



      79. I was not asked to make an anonymity order and, in any event,  see
          no reason to do so.
