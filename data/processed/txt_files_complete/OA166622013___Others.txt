                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and background

1.   This is an appeal by the  respondent  against  the  decision  of  Judge
    Callender Smith to allow the appellants' appeals under the  Immigration
    Rules.  The appellants in this case are Mrs Naseem Akhtar and Mr Rashid
    Razaqq, Mr Nasir Razzaq and Miss Farrukh Razzaq. Their dates  of  birth
    were respectively 11th February 1970, 10th April  1996,  15th  February
    1999 and 25th May 1997.

2.   The appellants each applied for settlement in  the  UK  to  join  their
    father, who is Mr Abdul Razzaq, a British citizen, whose date of  birth
    was 5 May 1969. The appellants  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against the respondent's decisions  in  their  cases  to  refuse  entry
    clearance to join the sponsor. It is clear  from  paragraph  3  of  the
    decision of Judge Callender Smith (before whom the appeals came  on  30
    September 2015 at Taylor House) that she regarded there  as  being  two
    points in the linked  appeals:  first,  whether  the  sponsor  met  the
    financial requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  secondly,  the
    status of Rashid Razzaq, given that he did not turn 18 until 10th April
    2014.  She refers to the financial requirements that needed to  be  met
    by the sponsor.  She also referred to an application by  Rashid  Razzaq
    under paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules for  settlement  with  his
    father under that paragraph.

Requirements of the Immigration Rules

3.   In relation to the requirements of the Rules,  I  have  been  taken  to
    Appendix  FM  by  Mr  Jarvis.  I  will  set  out  below  the   relevant
    requirements below. In addition, I have considered the requirements  of
    paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules, as it applies to Rashid Razzaq.
     Paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules is set out in Phelan at  p.847.
    It sets out the requirements a child of a parent present and settled in
    the UK must satisfy before he will be allowed indefinite leave to enter
    the UK. I understand it is not disputed by the respondent that Rashid's
    father (the sponsor) is settled in the UK. However, a number  of  other
    the requirements had to be satisfied before indefinite leave  to  enter
    would be given.  Where a child seeks  to  join  a  parent  present  and
    settled in the UK that the parent must have sole responsibility for the
    child's upbringing.  I understand that as far as Rashid  was  concerned
    this was the principal issue in his case.

4.   In relation to the other appellants, they had to meet the  requirements
    of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE (in Phelan at 1144 and 1172 et seq.).
    These included providing wage slips covering a  period  of  six  months
    prior to the application. These had to be provided for the employer  of
    the person concerned, or in relation to a period of salaried employment
    for the period of twelve months prior to the date of  the  application,
    the wage slips for at least the last six months  had  to  be  provided.
    Also, a letter from the employer confirming the type of employment  and
    the length of that employment were required. There should  also  be  an
    indication of any prior employment of that the person  where  relevant.
    Personal bank statement had to be provided as well.  This is  paragraph
    2(c) according to page 2 of  the  refusal  in  Naseem's  case,  but  no
    precise reference is given.  Personal bank statements which  correspond
    with the wage slips showing the salary having been paid into  the  bank
    account of the person concerned for the relevant period  will  also  be
    needed.  I will not expand on those requirements at this point as  they
    are fully set out in the respondent's refusal.

The appeal proceedings

5.   The Secretary of State appealed the decision by the  Immigration  Judge
    which was promulgated on 20 October 2015 because the Secretary of State
    said the salary requirements of the Immigration Rules had not been met.
     In particular, the sponsor appeared to receive  a  salary  of  �19,220
    plus a bonus of �7,508 giving an annual income of between  �26,720  and
    �27,220. This was insufficient to meet  the  minimum  income  threshold
    required by the Rules for such a large family.

Discussion

6.   Mr Jarvis's figures before the Upper Tribunal  are  slightly  different
    from those summarised in the previous paragraph, but the  substance  of
    his attack on the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is that the rules
    are clearly designed to require evidence which  satisfies  the  minimum
    income criteria. Those requirements were mandatory. Those  requirements
    were not met here. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge erred in allowing
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

7.   An additional difficulty with the Immigration Judge's decision is  that
    she says: "The relevant date  for  my  consideration  is  13  September
    2013". As I understand it the decisions in this case were  made  on  24
    July 2014, in the case of Rashid Razzaq, and 11  August  2014,  in  the
    case of the  other  appellants.   In  any  event,  the  minimum  income
    criteria plainly were not met at the latter of those two dates (i.e. on
    24 July 2014) As Mr Jarvis submitted, the minimum income criteria would
    be �18,600 for Mr Abdul Razzaq and an additional �3,800 for  the  first
    child plus �2,400 for each additional child.

8.   In terms of evidential requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  the  six-month
    period should have covered the period 28 December 2012 to 28 May  2013.
    Unfortunately, there was no adequate evidence that the  minimum  income
    requirements were met by the sponsor over that  period.   In  addition,
    the bank statements produced did not corroborate the  payments  to  the
    sponsor on the payslips.  They show sums of �299.88 and �68.01 per week
    which, when the calculation is  carried  out,  show  that  the  minimum
    income criteria was short by up to �5,000.

9.   Furthermore, although the Immigration Judge did  not  deal  with  human
    rights, it is clear following the Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in  SS
    (Congo) that a failure to meet the minimum income criteria in  Appendix
    FM-SE are significant matters. In the event that an appellant is unable
    to meet the minimum income  requirements  set  out  in  Appendix  FM-SE
    compelling reasons must be given for departing from those  requirements
    before an appeal may be allowed on human rights grounds.  Therefore, if
    the appellants' human rights were considered I am  satisfied  that  the
    Immigration Judge would also have dismissed the appeal on human  rights
    grounds as well as under the Immigration Rules.

Conclusions

10.  I am satisfied that the minimum income criteria contained  in  Appendix
    FM-SE were not met. I am also satisfied  that  Rashid  Razzaq  did  not
    satisfy the requirements of paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules. The
    sponsor would not have had sole responsibility for that appellant,  who
    has now turned 18 in any event, having been born on 10 April 1996.

11.  It follows that there were errors of law in the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal, as Mr Turner, who appears for the appellants, accepts. I
    am unable to accept his submission that the errors  of  law  identified
    were immaterial. The  Immigration  Judge  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to properly apply the minimum income criteria in the Immigration
    Rules and failed to deal properly with the  requirements  of  paragraph
    297 of the Immigration Rules.

12.  In the circumstances I have decided to set-aside the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and re-make the decision. There is  no  application
    to adduce  any  additional  evidence  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  My
    decision is therefore based on the documentary evidence supplied to the
    FTT and submissions made to the Upper Tribunal. Having considered  that
    evidence and those submissions, I find that the appellants did not meet
    the minimum  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  and  I  find  that  the
    appellant Rashid Razzaq did not meet the requirement of  paragraph  297
    of the Immigration Rules.


Notice of Decision


13.  For those reasons the Secretary of State's  appeal  is  allowed  and  I
    substitute my decision which is to  dismiss  the  appeals  against  the
    respondent's decisions to refuse entry clearance made on 24  July  2014
    and 11 August 2014.

14.  No anonymity direction is made.

Fee award

I have dismissed the appeal and therefore there can be no fee award.
