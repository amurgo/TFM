Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge P.J. Holmes sitting  at  Stoke  on  7
    November 2017) allowing the appellant's appeal on asylum and Article  8
    grounds. Although the Secretary of State is the appellant in the  Upper
    Tribunal, it is convenient to retain the designations used in the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do
    not consider that such a direction is warranted for  these  proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.



The Reason for the Grant of Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 3. On 16 January 2018 Judge Hodgkinson granted the  respondent  permission
    to appeal from the decision allowing the appeal on asylum grounds,  but
    not from the decision allowing the appeal under Article  8  ECHR.  This
    was because there was no arguable error  of  law  in  relation  to  the
    Judge's separate reasons for allowing the appeal on family and  private
    life grounds under Article 8 ECHR. Conversely, "it is correct that  the
    Judge's findings, at [18]-[20] of his decision, would indicate that the
    Judge intended to dismiss the protection  appeal,  whereas  he  allowed
    it."

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

 4. Rule 31 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014 provides that the Tribunal
    may at any time correct any clerical mistake or any accidental slip  or
    omission in a decision, direction or any document produced by it, by  -
    (a) providing notification of the alleged decision or direction,  or  a
    copy of the amended  document  to  all  parties;  and  (b)  making  any
    necessary amendment to any information published  in  relation  to  the
    decision, direction or document.

 5. There is a clear error "on the face of the record" as all  the  Judge's
    reasoning points towards the appeal on asylum grounds being  dismissed,
    and it is only in the formal conclusion at the end that he notifies his
    decision to allow the appeal on asylum grounds. I am satisfied that  if
    the anomaly in the Notice of Decision had been drawn to his  attention,
    he would have corrected it to say that he was dismissing the appeal.  I
    am certain that this is what he intended to say.

 6. Mr Holmes accepted that the decision on the asylum appeal was  vitiated
    by a material error of law and that it should be set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

 7. The Judge gave adequate reasons for finding that the appellant did  not
    have a well-founded fear of persecution on return to Ivory Coast, and I
    adopt those reasons for the purpose of remaking the decision. Mr Holmes
    did not invite me to reach a different conclusion on the evidence.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal
on grounds of humanitarian protection, and to  allow  his  appeal  on  human
rights grounds under Article 8 ECHR, did not contain an error  of  law,  and
this decision stands.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's  appeal  on
asylum grounds contained an error of law, and accordingly this  decision  is
set aside and the following decision is substituted: the appellant's  appeal
on asylum grounds is dismissed.
