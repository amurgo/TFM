                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellants' appeal against the decision of  Judge  Thornton
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 18th October 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellants are Chinese nationals.  The first Appellant  arrived  in
    the UK as a minor on 10th August  2007  and  claimed  asylum,  and  was
    refused and her subsequent appeals were  dismissed.  She  made  further
    submissions and was ultimately granted a period of discretionary leave,
    which expired on 19 October 2012. The refusal of  her  application  for
    further leave was the subject of the appeal before Judge Thornton.  The
    second Appellant arrived, also as a minor in May 2008 and also  claimed
    asylum.  His appeal rights are exhausted and he is  dependent  on  this
    claim.  The third and fourth Appellants are their children.

 3. The Appellant appealed on a number  of  grounds,  including  under  the
    Refugee Convention and Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR and Judge  Thornton
    dismissed her appeal on all counts.

 4. The Appellant sought permission to appeal against each aspect of  Judge
    Thornton's decision.  On  26th  November  2013  Judge  Kimnell  granted
    permission to appeal against the decision on Article 8 grounds only.

 5. With respect to Article 8, the judge recorded that the Appellants would
    be returned to China as a single family  unit  and  their  family  life
    would not suffer interference on return.  She rejected  the  contention
    that the second Appellant enjoyed family life with  his  former  foster
    carers.

 6. She accepted that the adults had been in the UK  since  2007  and  2008
    respectively but each had entered illegally.  They were  16  when  they
    came and therefore had spent the majority  of  their  lives  in  China.
    There was no reliable evidence in relation to the claim that the  first
    Appellant had no family in China nor that the second Appellant  had  no
    contact with his grandparents, his parents having died.  She said  that
    even if it were the case that neither had any family in China they were
    adults who had gained advantages of education and  work  experience  in
    the UK which could be used to enhance employment  prospects  in  China.
    Friendships could be maintained via modern means of communication.

 7. With respect to the children she wrote as follows:

         "In balancing the Appellants' rights against the wider interests of
         the community, I  shall  first  consider  in  accordance  with  the
         judgment of the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4
         and EA (Article 8 - best interests of child)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT
         00315 what is in the best interests of the children.  It is in  the
         best interests of the children to live with and be  brought  up  by
         their parents.  Although the children were born in the UK they  are
         not British citizens.  They are very small children of only 2ï¿½  and
         20 months and will therefore be primarily focused on themselves and
         their parents.  It is in their best interests to return  to  China,
         the country of their nationality, to live in  a  family  unit  with
         their parents."

 8. Miss Warren submitted that the consideration  of  the  children's  best
    interests was flawed.  The judge had referred to the  health  condition
    of the fourth Appellant in relation to her consideration of  Article  3
    but had not  taken  into  account  his  complex  health  needs  in  her
    assessment of what would be in his best interests.  There was  evidence
    before the judge that he had  significant  health  problems  which  had
    required hospital admission in the past and it was clear that he  would
    need treatment for those conditions in the future. Moreover she had not
    taken into account the decision in AX (family planning scheme) China CG
    [2012] UKUT 00097 in relation to Article 8.  In failing to have  regard
    to relevant factors the judge had erred in law.

 9. Mr Diwnycz submitted that on the evidence  before  the  judge  she  was
    entitled to reach the conclusion that she had.

Consideration of whether there is an error of law

10. I agree that the consideration of the best interests of the children is
    incomplete  because  although  the  judge  referred   to   the   fourth
    Appellant's medical issues in relation to Article 3 she  did  not  turn
    her mind to their relevance in assessing his best interests.   Neither,
    when she said that the children's best interests lay in remaining  with
    their family and returning to their  country  of  nationality  did  she
    consider what in practice that would mean for these children.

11. The country guidance case, AX,  held that, for multiple child families:

         "(vi)    Any second child even if authorised entails  for  loss  of
             the family's SCP certificate.  Loss of a family's SCP  results
             in loss of privileged access to schools, housing, pensions and
             free  medical  and  contraceptive  treatment.   Education  and
             medical treatment remain available but are no longer free.

         (vii)    Where an unauthorised  child  is  born,  the  family  will
             encounter  additional  penalties.   Workplace  discipline  for
             parents in employment is likely to include demotion  and  even
             loss of employment.  In addition a social upbringing charge is
             payable (SUC) which is based on income with a down payment  of
             50% and three years to pay the balance.

        viii) There are hundreds of thousands of unauthorised children born
              every year.  Family planning officials are  not  entitled  to
              refuse to register unauthorised children and there is no real
              risk of a refusal to register a  child.   Payment  for  birth
              permits for the registration of children and  the  imposition
              of SUC charges for  unauthorised  births  are  a  significant
              source of revenue  for  local  family  planning  authorities.
              There is a tension between that profitability and enforcement
              of the nationally imposed  quota  of  births  for  the  town,
              country and province  exceeding  which  can  harm  officials'
              careers.

          ix) (ix)    The financial consequences for a family of losing its
              SCP (for having more than one child) and/or of having  a  SUC
              imposed (for having unauthorised children)  and/or  suffering
              disadvantages  in  terms  of  access  to  education,  medical
              treatment, loss of employment, detriment to future employment
              etc. will not in general  reach  the  severity  threshold  to
              amount to persecution or serious harm or treatment in  breach
              of Article 3."

12. The decision in relation to Article 8 is set aside.

Remaking the decision

13.  Judge  Thornton's  findings  of  fact  have  not   been   successfully
    challenged.  The basis for this determination is therefore her  finding
    that neither the first nor the second Appellant would  be  at  risk  on
    Refugee Convention grounds on return to China, that neither  had  shown
    that they were unregistered persons in China and  none  of  the  family
    would be at risk of Article 3 ill-treatment.

14.  Miss  Warren  adduced  further  evidence  namely  a  letter  from  the
    consultant paediatrician dated 13th January 2014. She also asked for  a
    short adjournment  so  that  the  mental  health  needs  of  the  first
    Appellant could be assessed.  I did not consider this to be  necessary.
    This appeal has been going on for a very long period of time. If  there
    was a serious mental health issue I would have expected it to have come
    to light at a much earlier stage than the day of the hearing.

15. It says that the fourth Appellant was born at 30 weeks'  gestation  and
    remained in hospital until  he  was  4  months  old.   He  was  briefly
    admitted to the paediatric ward on 14th August 2012, some  four  months
    later with bronchiolitis and there have been two further admissions  in
    January 2013 and April 2013.  He was last seen in  clinic  in  December
    2013 when he appeared well on  his  current  treatment  of  daily  oral
    medication.  If he remained well he may be able to try for a period off
    the medication during the summer but was likely to need further support
    in the winter.  The history of prematurity and early bronchiolitis  are
    the most likely underlying cause for his tendency to wheeze with  viral
    illnesses.

16. The consultant says that DL also has hearing loss and has had a general
    anaesthetic to investigate when he was found to have  very  narrow  ear
    canals contributing to wax build-up and subsequent  hearing  loss.   He
    ought to have further hearing assessments in the community to  evaluate
    his hearing.  Prematurity in itself carries some risk of  developmental
    problems and such children require close attention to  all  aspects  of
    their health to ensure development is not further compromised.   Whilst
    to date he has made good progress,  it  is  too  early  to  assess  any
    potential needs he may have.

17. Miss Warren also produced a letter from Humber NHS Trust referring  the
    first Appellant to an individual in relation to mental health problems.

18. She submitted that it was clear that the children's best interests  lay
    in remaining in the UK.  If they were returned to China they would face
    significant hardship.

19. They would not be returning with any financial resources.  Miss  Warren
    relied on AX for the proposition that  children  in  multiple  families
    would not be entitled to free education  and  medical  treatment.  They
    would also face difficulties on  account  of  their  both  having  left
    illegally.  At paragraph 108 of AX the Tribunal said that  the  penalty
    for illegal exit would be administrative detention for  not  more  than
    five days and a fine of up to 500 RMB. Both parents  had  been  out  of
    China for a very lengthy period of time.  There was evidence  that  the
    first Appellant had vulnerabilities of her  own  which  in  turn  would
    impact on her ability to care for the children.  For  this  family  the
    consequences of return would be harsh.

20. Whilst there were countervailing factors, namely the fact that they had
    made claims for asylum on grounds not found to have been made out,  the
    best interests of the children should be followed and the appeal  ought
    to be allowed.

21. Mr Diwnycz relied on the reasons for refusal letter. He  accepted  that
    there would be some hardship but there were no insurmountable obstacles
    to the family's return and where the Article 8 Rules were  not  met  it
    would be rare for the Tribunal to depart from them.

Findings and Conclusions

22. It is not argued that the Appellants meet the requirements set  out  in
    the Immigration Rules for a grant of leave to remain on the grounds  of
    private life, paragraph 276ADE.  Miss Warren did not suggest  that  the
    Appellants have no social, cultural or family ties  with  China.   They
    would be returned as a unit. Neither can they meet the requirements  of
    EX1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules because the  children  have
    not lived in the UK continuously for seven years immediately  preceding
    the date of application.

23. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    the Upper Tribunal held that:

         "After applying the requirements of the Rules, only  if  there  may
         arguably be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them
         is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether
         there are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them:  Nagre."

24. The Tribunal also wrote as follows:

         "On a thorough review of the Strasbourg guidance, Sales J concluded
         that  in  a  precarious  family  life  case  only  in   exceptional
         circumstances would  removal  of  the  non-national  family  member
         constitute a violation of Article 8.  To  show  that,  despite  the
         absence  of  insurmountable  obstacles   to   removal,   it   would
         nonetheless be disproportionate, it  would  be  necessary  to  show
         other non-standard  and  particular  features  of  the  case  of  a
         compelling nature demonstrating that removal would be unjustifiably
         harsh."

25. In this case there are arguably good grounds  for  considering  whether
    there should be a grant of leave outside the Rules, namely  the  health
    of the fourth Appellant and the particular circumstances to  which  the
    Appellants would return in China.

26. The leading case on considering the  best  interests  of  the  children
    remains ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4.   The  Supreme  Court  held
    that the best interests of the children must be a  primary  albeit  not
    paramount  consideration.   It  will  involve  asking  whether  it   is
    reasonable to expect the child to live in another  country.  The  court
    accepted that the children's best interests could be outweighed by  the
    cumulative effect of other considerations.

27. Both children retain the nationality of their parents  and  as  Chinese
    nationals would be returning with them to their country of nationality.
     They are very young and there is no evidence of their having put  down
    any roots in the UK or formed links outside the family unit  save  with
    the doctors who are treating the fourth Appellant.  Their parents speak
    limited English, if any, in that they needed an interpreter to  explain
    the proceedings to them and the children would therefore  be  returning
    to a country where their primary language is spoken.

28. Most important in the consideration of the  children's  best  interests
    are D L's health needs.  In fact it is uncertain what they are.  He was
    born very prematurely, spent the first  four  months  of  his  life  in
    hospital and has had a couple of brief admissions since, the last  nine
    months ago.  Neither of the conditions from which he suffers are in any
    sense life threatening and indeed at the moment he appears to be  doing
    well. He is taking oral medication in the winter months and may be able
    to manage without in the  summer.  The  evidence  in  relation  to  his
    mother's mental health is scant, there having only been a  very  recent
    referral, but if there were serious concerns I would have expected them
    to have been documented over the last months or years.

29. There is some evidence that the family  would  suffer  some  degree  of
    hardship in returning to China,  with  two  children,  having  left  as
    illegal  entrants.  The  penalties  outlined  in  AX  relating  to  the
    workplace would not apply in this case since W L is  not  presently  in
    employment in China. On the other hand  there  is  evidence  that  they
    would have to pay for medical treatment.

30. The Appellants have not been believed in their claims. They state  that
    they would be returning without any meaningful support and it  is  true
    that they both came to the UK some seven years ago at the age of 16. It
    is likely therefore that the family and social networks which they  had
    when they left will have to be rebuilt.

31. It is difficult to say what the best interests of the children are.  On
    the one hand they will return to an uncertain situation in China  where
    there is evidence that the family will have to pay to access the health
    care which is required. On the other they will be returning with  their
    parents to the country of their nationality  and  whilst  there  is  no
    positive evidence of relatives in  China,  the  witnesses  having  been
    found not to be credible, it is not possible  to  conclude  that  there
    will be no members of either the immediate  or  wider  family  able  to
    assist in their resettlement.

32. In ZH the children were British and the  Supreme  Court  placed  strong
    emphasis on  the  detriment  caused  by  the  loss  of  access  to  the
    advantages of British citizenship which removal would entail.  Moreover
    the children were older and had formed their own social networks.  None
    of those considerations apply here.

33. On balance I  conclude  that  whilst  it  is  in  the  children's  best
    interests to remain in the UK in  the  shorter  term,  because  of  the
    problems in resettlement, in the longer term returning to their country
    of nationality and the opportunity of making relationships  with  wider
    family members may well be in their  best  interests.  D  L's  problems
    appear to be mainly behind him and there is excellent  health  care  in
    China should that be needed.

34. The Secretary of State has a  significant  interest  in  this  family's
    removal. The two adults came here on a false prospectus, and  there  is
    likely to be a cost to the public purse if they stay. No  evidence  was
    adduced to  show  that  the  family  is  self  sufficient.  The  second
    Appellant says in his witness statement that he is now working, and  if
    so that experience will stand him in good stead on return.

35.  Accordingly  I  conclude  that  removal  is  proportionate   and   the
    Appellants' appeals fail on article 8 grounds.

Decision

36. The original judge erred in law.   Her  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is substituted.  The Appellants' appeal is dismissed
    on all grounds.
