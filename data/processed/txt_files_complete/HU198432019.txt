                            DECISION AND REASONS


Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr. S Bellara, Counsel, instructed by Legend Solicitors
For the Respondent: Ms. S Cunha, Senior Presenting Officer

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of India and  is  aged  42.  He  appeals  a
    decision of the respondent to refuse to grant him indefinite  leave  to
    remain in this country on long-residence grounds under the  Immigration
    Rules, and in the alternative leave to remain on human rights  (article
    8) grounds.

 2. His appeal was initially considered by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Maka ('the Judge'), who dismissed his appeal by a decision sent to  the
    parties on 18 March 2020.  The  appellant  was  granted  permission  to
    appeal and I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  2
    October 2020 having determined that the Judge had materially  erred  in
    law.

 3.  I  preserved  findings  of  fact  made  by  the  Judge,  namely  those
    identifiable within paras. 37 and 39 of his decision.

 4. This matter was listed before me on 21 December 2020  for  the  resumed
    hearing.

Remote hearing

 5. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in the same way as if we were together
    in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this constituted a hearing in
    open court; that the open justice principle has been secured;  that  no
    party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar  as  there  has  been  any
    restriction on a right or interest, it is justified  as  necessary  and
    proportionate.

Background

 6. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 6 December 2009 with  entry
    clearance as a Working Holidaymaker, valid from 5 June 2009 to  5  June
    2011. He left the country and on 10  July  2011  he  re-entered  having
    secured entry clearance as a Tier 2 (General)  Migrant  valid  from  27
    June 2011 to 26 July 2014.

 7. He made an in-time application on 25 July 2014  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant.  The  respondent  refused  the
    application by a decision dated 8 October 2014.

 8. Om 22 October 2014,  within  28  days  of  the  previous  refusal,  the
    appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant.
    The respondent refused the application by a decision dated  15  January
    2015.

 9. On 19 January 2015, the appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier
    2 (General) Migrant. The respondent granted leave by a  decision  dated
    10 February 2015, with such leave expiring on 15 February 2018.

10. The appellant applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General)
    Migrant on 9 November 2016. The application was refused by  a  decision
    dated 13 September 2017. He continued to enjoy previously granted leave
    until it was curtailed to end on 18 December 2017.

11. On 2 October 2017 the appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier 2
    (General) Migrant. The respondent refused the application on 14 October
    2017 and re-affirmed the decision on 13  November  2017  consequent  to
    Administrative Review.

12.  The  appellant  applied  in-time  for  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Immigration  Rules  on  18  December   2017.   This   application   was
    subsequently varied on 12 January 2018  and  by  a  decision  dated  22
    February 2018 the respondent granted the appellant leave to remain as a
    Tier 4 (General) Student until 1 July 2019.

13. On 1 July 2019 the appellant applied in-time for leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 2 (General) Migrant and subsequently varied the application on  29
    August 2019 and again on 14 November 2019  to  one  seeking  indefinite
    leave to remain on the grounds of 10 years long residence.

14. By a decision dated  18  November  2019,  the  respondent  refused  the
    application for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B of  the
    Immigration Rules, concluding:

         'Careful consideration has been given to your  immigration  history
         ... It is noted that your application of 25 July 2014  was  refused
         on 08 October 2014. You made a further application  on  22  October
         2014 which was refused on  15  January  2015.  Following  this  you
         [made] a further application on 19 January 2015 which  was  granted
         on 10 February 2015.


         As your application  was  refused  on  08  October  2014  and  your
         subsequent application was also refused you had no lawful leave  to
         remain in the UK from 08 October 2014 until 10 February  2015  when
         you were next granted leave. This is a gap of 125 days (4 months  2
         days) in your lawful leave.


         Therefore, as you have not had 10 years continuous lawful residence
         in the UK you fail to meet the requirements of paragraph 276B(i)(a)
         of the Immigration Rules.


         The Secretary of State has therefore refused your  application  for
         indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom on  the  basis  of
         completing 10 years Long Residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
         paragraph 276D of the Immigration Rules as  you  do  not  meet  the
         requirements of Paragraph 276B(i)(a) with reference to  276A(b)  of
         the Immigration Rules.'


Decision

15. I observe the relevant Immigration Rules:

         276B.   The requirements to be met by an applicant  for  indefinite
                leave to remain on the  ground  of  long  residence  in  the
                United Kingdom are that:


                  (i) (a)    he has had at least 10 years continuous  lawful
                        residence in the United Kingdom.
                  ...


                  (v)         the applicant must not be in the UK in  breach
                        of immigration laws, except that,  where  paragraph
                        39E of these Rules applies, any current  period  of
                        overstaying  will  be  disregarded.  Any   previous
                        period of overstaying between periods of leave will
                        also be disregarded where -


                           (a)    the previous application was  made  before
                                 24 November 2016 and within 28 days of the
                                 expiry of leave; or


                           (b)       the further application was made on  or
                                 after 24 November 2016 and  paragraph  39E
                                 of these Rules applied.

         276C.    Indefinite leave to remain on the ground of long residence
                in the United Kingdom  may  be  granted  provided  that  the
                Secretary  of  State  is  satisfied   that   each   of   the
                requirements of paragraph 276B is met.

16. The decision of 2 October 2020 preserved the following findings of  the
    Judge:

         '37. I accept the appellant's immigration history  as  indeed  both
            representatives did before me.  The  only  issue  taken  in  the
            refusal letter is the gap between 2014 and 2015. The appellant's
            application of 25 July 2014 was refused on 8 October 2014. He re-
            applied on 22 October 2014 and this  was  again  refused  on  15
            January 2015. He made a further application on 19  January  2015
            and this was granted on 10 February 2015. The argument  is  that
            he had no leave to remain in the UK from 8 October 2014 until 10
            February 2015, being a gap of 125  days.  The  appellant  argues
            that [the]  gap  of  125  days  was  due  to  an  error  of  the
            respondent. When he applied on 22 October 2014, he contacted the
            respondent asking to vary his application as he  [had]  found  a
            new employer.[1] He was told in order to assign a new  COS,  his
            existing employer had to withdraw the current COS before  a  new
            form could be sent with the new employer's details. He was given
            7 days to provide this. Without notice on 15 January  2015,  the
            respondent went onto refuse the application due to  their  being
            no COS on file.


         ...


         39. In closing submissions, I asked the presenting  office  whether
            he had something on file or note on  his  system  counter-acting
            the interpretation given by the appellant to the GCID  notes  in
            his case, obtained by him.  The  presenting  officer  could  not
            point  me  to  anything.  I  am  satisfied,  on  a  balance   of
            probabilities, the appellant's interpretation is  correct.  This
            was an innocent error by the respondent. I accept the  appellant
            has contacted the respondent seeking to change his employer  and
            was told his original COS would have to be withdrawn and  a  new
            form submitted to enable it to be changed.  I  accept  the  GCID
            notes are not  wholly  clear.  Nevertheless,  they  support  the
            appellant's interpretation in that the application  was  refused
            on 14 January 2015 purely on the basis of  there  being  no  COS
            without reference to the entry  of  16  December  2014.  I  also
            accept Counsel's submission, an out of time application (or more
            than 125 days) would not have been accepted a month later unless
            there was some consideration, or exercise of 'discretion' having
            regard to the earlier  confusion  over  the  absent  COS.  I  am
            therefore   satisfied   this   constituted    an    'exceptional
            circumstance' beyond the appellant's control as it was an  error
            of the respondent. I do not hold this against him as this was an
            error of the respondent.'

17. By a position statement, authored by  Mr.  Lindsay,  Senior  Presenting
    Office, and dated 23 November 2020 the respondent confirmed  that  only
    one issue was to be considered by the Tribunal, at [5]-[9]:

         '5.  A single specific grounds for refusal was  identified  in  the
            RFRL; a gap in continuous lawful residence of 125 days between 8
            October 2014 and 10 February 2015  (hereafter  'the  break'  for
            convenience).


         6.   The SSHD maintains that the break is fatal to A's claim  under
            para 276B of the Immigration Rules; and is the only  basis  upon
            which that claim should be held  to  fail.  Accordingly,  it  is
            respectfully submitted that the RFRL is correct  and  should  be
            upheld. The following submissions are intended  to  clarify  the
            underlying reasoning.


         7.   The immigration history of A as set out in the RFRL was not in
            dispute before the FTT and was accepted by Judge Maka  at  [37].
            A's immigration history as recited by the Judge includes at [19]
            that A's in-time application as a Tier 2 Migrant was refused  on
            8 October 2014. It is clear  that  leave  was  not  extended  by
            [section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971] past  this  point;  and
            further leave was not granted until 10 February 2015.


         8.   Accordingly, the break relied upon in the RFRL did occur. This
            is consistent with the FTT's analysis at  [37-39].  it  is  also
            consistent with the Upper Tribunal's decision on error of law at
            [8]. The clear findings of the Tribunal therefore that the break
            did occur, but it was not A's fault.


         9.    It is respectfully submitted that the effect of the break  is
            that para. 276B(i)(a) is  not  met  by  A  because  he  has  not
            demonstrated at least 10 years continuous  lawful  residents  in
            the UK. This is so not withstanding that the break was  not  the
            fault of A.

18. The starting point for my consideration is that the appellant's in time
    application for leave to remain as  a  Tier  2  (General)  Migrant  was
    refused on 8 October 2014. He was next granted leave to  remain  on  10
    February 2015.

19. As previously found by the Judge, the appellant was not  at  fault  for
    the adverse decision of 15 January 2015. Rather,  having  informed  the
    appellant as to steps to take to amend his application, the  respondent
    proceeded to make the decision whilst on notice  that  such  steps,  as
    advised, were being undertaken but not completed. I am  satisfied  that
    no reasonable public authority, such as the respondent, would refuse to
    exercise discretion in favour of the applicant if this  were  the  only
    adverse matter placed against him.

20. That leaves for consideration the out-of-time application  for  further
    leave to remain made on 22 October 2014, 14 days after the respondent's
    refusal of  the  earlier  in-time  application  for  leave  to  remain.
    Observing the recent Court of Appeal judgment in Hoque v. Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1357 the second disregard
    in paragraph 276B(v) concerned with overstaying is to be applied  as  a
    qualifying sub-paragraph of paragraph 276B(i)(a). I  observe  paragraph
    276B(v)(a) of the Rules and the respondent's 'Long Residence'  (version
    15) guidance, the latter in place at the time of the latest decision in
    this matter. Any short gaps in lawful residence through making previous
    applications out-of-time by no more than 28 calendar days  where  those
    gaps end before 24 November 2016 will be disregarded  when  considering
    continuous residence under paragraph 276B(i)(a). Being mindful  of  the
    guidance provided by  the  Court  in  Hoque  the  appellant  is  to  be
    considered a 'book-ended' overstayer, namely a  person  whose  previous
    period of overstaying fell between periods of lawful leave and so falls
    into the category of person who benefits from paragraph 276B(v).

21. I note at this juncture that whilst Ms.  Cunha  did  not  concede  this
    matter, she acknowledged that the Court of  Appeal  decision  in  Hoque
    identifies the present approach to paragraph 276B(i)(a) and (v) of  the
    Rules.

22.   I  find  that  the  appellant  meets  the  requirement  of  paragraph
    276B(i)(a) of the Rules. As this is the sole ground of  refusal  relied
    upon by the appellant, his human rights  (article  8)  appeal  must  be
    allowed.

23. Consequently, there is  no  requirement  to  proceed  to  consider  the
    appellant's article 8 rights outside of the Rules.

Notice of Decision

24. By means of a decision dated 12 October 2020 this  Tribunal  set  aside
    the Judge's decision promulgated on 18 March 2019 pursuant  to  section
    12(2)(a) of the Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

25. The decision is re-made, and the appellant's appeal is allowed on human
    rights (article 8) grounds.

Upper Tribunal Judge O'Callaghan
Dated: 22 December 2020

-----------------------
[1] For clarity, the appellant's evidence is that he contacted the
respondent in mid-December 2014 seeking advice as to how he could name a
new employer in respect of his October 2014 application for leave to remain
as Tier 2 (General) Migrant.
