Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Chohan, Counsel, instructed by S Z Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The  appellants,  who  are  nationals  of  India,  have  permission  to
    challenge the decision of Judge Seelhoff  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (FtT) sent on 7 August 2017 dismissing their appeals.  They are husband
    and wife.  They have three children aged 4, 2 and 6 months.   They  had
    lodged appeals in respect of two decisions of the Secretary  of  State:
    one dated 17 February 2016  refusing  the  first  appellant  indefinite
    leave to remain (ILR); the other dated 11 March 2016 refusing both  the
    first appellant and the second appellant leave to remain under the Tier
    1 Entrepreneur scheme.

2.   The appellants' immigration history in brief  is  as  follows.   On  14
    February 2006 the first appellant was granted leave to enter the UK  as
    a student and he was granted an extension in the same capacity until 28
    February 2010.  On 12 May 2010 his application for leave to remain as a
    Tier 4 General Student was refused, but  on  7  November  2011  he  was
    granted leave to remain under the Tier  1  Post  Study  Migrant  scheme
    until 7 November 2013.  On 6 November 2013, the day  before  his  leave
    expired, he submitted a Tier  1  Entrepreneur  application.   When  the
    first appellant applied for ILR in February 2016, and  was  refused  on
    the  same  day,  his  Tier  1  Entrepreneur   application   was   still
    outstanding. A decision on the latter was eventually made on  11  March
    2016.

The Decision of 17 February 2016 Refusing the First Appellant ILR

3.   The reasons the respondent gave  for  refusing  the  first  appellant's
    application for ILR were that he had not accrued ten years'  continuous
    lawful residence, as required by  paragraph  276A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules by virtue of a break in continuity of some  five  months  and  29
    days.  It was acknowledged he had lawful residence from 12  March  2006
    until 4 October 2010 (when he became appeal rights exhausted in respect
    of the decision refusing his Tier 4 (General) Student application on 23
    March 2010).  He did not make a subsequent application  until  2  April
    2011.  The decision letter also stated that the first appellant was not
    able to meet the requirements of Appendix FM either as a partner  or  a
    parent, or on the basis of private life under  paragraph  276ADE.   The
    refusal letter concluded by stating that since the first appellant  had
    not outlined any exceptional circumstances,  his  application  did  not
    fall for a grant of leave outside the Rules.

4.   The first appellant's grounds of appeal  contended  that  the  decision
    was an unjustifiable interference with  his  Article  8  rights  as  no
    consideration had been given to his established private and family life
    in the UK and the reasons/obstacles preventing him and his family  from
    returning to Pakistan and that it had not taken  account  of  the  best
    interests of the children.

The  Decision  of  11  March  2016  Refusing  the  Tier   1   (Entrepreneur)
    Application

5.    The  reasons  given  by  the  respondent  for  refusing  the  combined
    application made by the two appellants under the Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
    scheme were various but can be  summarised  as  being  that  the  first
    appellant had not shown that his business proposal was a genuine one.

6.   The appellants' grounds of appeal against this decision were  that  the
    decision was not in accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules  and  was
    incompatible with their Article 8 rights  and  that  discretion  should
    have been exercised differently.   The  appeal  letter  requested  that
    their appeal against this decision be  linked  with  that  against  the
    refusal of ILR.

The Judge's Decision

7.   Having taken oral evidence  from  the  two  appellants  and  heard  the
    submissions of the parties, the judge addressed the refusal decision of
    February 2016 and reminded himself that he  only  had  jurisdiction  to
    allow appeals on human rights grounds.  As regards  the  issue  of  the
    break  in  the  continuity  of  the  first  appellant's  residence,  he
    concluded that:

    (i)  the appellant had been treated unfairly in 2010 as the  respondent
         had failed to apply evidential flexibility to his application;


    (ii) if he were to be considering the application under  the  Rules  "I
         would probably make a finding that the Appellant ought to have been
         treated as if he fell within the terms of the  Respondent's  policy
         on long residence applications which  was  being  operated  at  the
         time";


    (iii)    as he only had jurisdiction to allow appeals on  human  rights
         grounds, it was relevant that the lawful residence relied on from 6
         November 2013 until 17 February 2016 was "derived from [section] 3C
         leave [Section 3C of the Immigration Act  1971  ("the  1971  Act")]
         secured by an application as an entrepreneur which it must be  said
         was of very dubious merit" (paragraph 41);


    (iv) the appellant and his representatives were clearly put  on  notice
         of the respondent's intentions to rely on the dubious nature of the
         Tier 1 Entrepreneur application but failed to address or attempt to
         rebut this alleged feature of it in the  evidence  prepared  before
         the appeal; and


    (v)  the first appellant's oral evidence to the judge relating  to  his
         Tier 1 application, especially as regards what had happened  during
         the period whilst the application was pending, was  unsatisfactory.
         At paragraph 46 the judge stated:


             "It flows from this finding that I find that 2� years  of  the
             lawful residence that the Appellant relies on was  secured  in
             bad faith by making a Tier 1 entrepreneur application based on
             flawed business plans and  relying  on  funds  that  were  not
             genuinely available.  These findings inform  my  consideration
             of section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act
             2002 in that I  consider  that  limited  weight  ought  to  be
             attached to those 2� years as they are  properly  regarded  as
             very precarious".


8.   The judge then addressed the appellants' circumstances in  relation  to
    Article 8, both inside the Rules and outside the Rules.  He  considered
    that the respondent's decision was a  proportionate  interference  with
    the appellants' family life.  In this regard, he did  not  accept  that
    there would be significant obstacles to the family's  reintegration  in
    India and considered that the children's best interests did  not  point
    significantly beyond remaining with  their  parents.   As  regards  the
    appellants' private life, he considered that only limited weight  could
    be attached to it in view of the fact that  the  first  appellant  must
    have known the Section 3C leave secured  by  the  Tier  1  Entrepreneur
    application was unreliable.  The second appellant had only been in  the
    UK  for  approximately  five  years  and  it  was  accepted  that   her
    application for leave as a points-based  dependant  could  not  succeed
    once the husband had applied for ILR on the basis of long residence.

9.   At paragraph 54 the judge concluded:

         "In terms of considering the public interest in refusal I note that
         there is significant public interest in preserving the integrity of
         the immigration system.  Granting indefinite  leave  to  remain  in
         this case would effectively endorse and disregard the fact  that  a
         quarter of the ten year's  residence  was  obtained  by  making  an
         application that was without merit  and  arguably  duplicitous.   I
         considered that it is highly important that the immigration  system
         is not seen to be exploitable in this way".


10.  It is to be noted that in  the  course  of  assessing  the  appellants'
    appeals the judge made a number of observations about the  co-existence
    of appeals against the two decisions (the  ten  year  ILR  and  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur decisions).  At paragraph 11 he said that  in  respect  of
    the first appellant his ten  year  application  "should  have  had  the
    effect of varying [the  first  appellant's]  Tier  1  Post  study  work
    application" but and that in respect of the second appellant "[n]o  new
    application was lodged on behalf of the second appellant leaving her in
    essence as a PBS dependent with no  PBS  migrant  to  depend  on".   At
    paragraph 12 he said that the first appellant's appeal was against  the
    ten year ILR refusal decision.  At paragraph 14 he said that  the  only
    applicable decision in  respect  of  the  second  appellant  was  as  a
    dependant  of  her  husband's  points-based  application;   adding   at
    paragraph 20 that "her appeal proceeds solely outside the  Rules".   At
    paragraph 42 he stated that "in effect the [Tier 1] decision is null as
    having been made in respect of an application which has been varied".

The Grounds of Appeal

11.  The grounds identified the two issues as being:

    "(i)     the break in the chain of ten years' continuous leave; and


    (ii) "[a]lleged deception in Tier 1 Entrepreneur application".


12.  Regarding (i), it was submitted that the extant leave  granted  to  the
    first appellant by virtue of Section 3C from  6  November  2013  to  17
    February 2016 (when he applied for ILR) was  guaranteed  by  Parliament
    and the Tribunal judge should  not  have  interfered.   Article  8  was
    clearly "engaged" as he had been in the UK since  March  2006  and  had
    formed his private and family life in the UK.  Regarding (ii),  it  was
    advanced that the respondent should have voided the Tier 1 Entrepreneur
    application as it has been varied by the ILR application of 17 February
    2016 pursuant to Section 3C(5) of the Immigration Act 1971.  That being
    the case, the judge's reliance on the  Tier  1  refusal  decision  "was
    misplaced as that application was voided under Section  3C(5)  and  the
    decision was illegal".  In any event, that decision showed insufficient
    funds; the respondent had not alleged deception.

13.  We heard submissions from Mr Chohan and Mr Avery and  we  would  record
    that we found them helpful.  Mr Chohan's largely reiterated points made
    in the written grounds.  He said that whilst he accepted  that  in  the
    context of an appeal confined to human rights, the judge  was  entitled
    to take the decision letter of March 2016 into  account,  by  the  same
    token he should have taken into account that it should  not  have  been
    made (because the 6 November 2013 application had been voided); that it
    would not have been before the judge in any event if the respondent had
    not sat on her hands for two and a half years; and that in  seeking  to
    rely on seeming deception the respondent was seeking "a second bite  of
    the cherry through the back door".  Except for her delay,  there  would
    have been no issue about the quality of the  ten  year  residence.   As
    regards Article 8, he submitted that the judge had not  given  adequate
    weight to the appellants' long residence, family life ties and the fact
    they had never been a burden on the state.  Mr Avery submitted that the
    judge's determination was free of legal error; the judge  was  entitled
    to have regard to the quality of the ten years' residence in  light  of
    what evidence there was regarding the Tier 1 application.

Our Decision

14.  In relation to  the  judge's  rejection  of  first  appellant's  appeal
    against the refusal of ILR made in February 2016, we discern  no  legal
    error.  Whether or not on a proper  understanding  of  section  3C  the
    respondent's  later  decision  refusing   the   Tier   1   Entrepreneur
    application should have been made, the fact of the matter was  that  it
    was produced by the respondent as  part  of  the  appeal  bundle.   The
    appellants were clearly aware that it formed part of the appeal  papers
    and could not have been at all surprised by that as they had themselves
    requested that their appeal  against  the  ten  year  ILR  and  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur decisions be heard  together.   They  did  not  raise  any
    objection to the  inclusion  of  the  later  refusal  decision  at  the
    hearing.  At  the  hearing  the  first  appellant  was   afforded   the
    opportunity to answer questions about the circumstances surrounding his
    Tier 1 application, its basis in fact and the  subsequent  developments
    relevant to it that has taken place during the period when it was still
    pending.  Their representative at the hearing (Mr Slatter) was able  to
    make submissions on its relevance.

15.  Mr Chohan says that the judge should have attached little or no  weight
    to the perceived lack of quality in the first  appellant's  Section  3C
    leave secured by the application as a Tier 1 entrepreneur because  that
    leave was lawful and there would have been no issue about  its  quality
    if the respondent had avoided sitting on her hands.  That submission is
    unsustainable.  The first appellant was  only  able  to  argue  he  had
    achieved ten years' lawful residence (or its equivalent)  by  reference
    to the period from March 2006 to March 2016.  Two and a half  years  of
    that period was comprised by the Section 3C leave.  If  the  respondent
    had not sat on her hands, he would not have been able to apply  on  the
    basis of ten years' residence in the  first  place.   Further,  as  the
    appeal was on human rights grounds, it was entirely open to  the  judge
    to take into account what the evidence showed regarding the Section  3C
    period of leave.  The judge's focus in legal terms had  to  be  on  the
    nature and quality of the first appellant's private life including over
    the  period  from  6  November  2013  to  17  February  2016.  For  the
    appellant's private life argument the length and quality of his  period
    of residence was a highly material matter.

16.  Mr Chohan has sought to rely on another  point.  He  argued  that  even
    assuming  the  judge  was  entitled  to  have  regard  to  the  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur refusal decision (and related documentation), he  was  not
    entitled to regard that as tainted by deception.  Our response to  that
    submission is twofold.  First, the judge did not find  that  the  first
    appellant had used deception; nor had the respondent sought  to  allege
    it.  Certainly the judge expressed concerns about its  reliability  and
    bona fides; but in terms of deception or fraud the furthest  the  judge
    went was to state that in his assessment it was "arguably duplicitous".
    Second, it is simply wrong  of  the  appellant  to  maintain  that  the
    evidence only identified insufficiency of funds (see  paragraph  12  of
    the grounds).  The difficulties identified with the  first  appellant's
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur application went well beyond insufficiency of funds
    and encompassed reliance on a venture capital  fund  that  lacked  bona
    fides (Equinox); a lack of credible  evidence  of  market  research;  a
    flawed business plan. Each of these shortcomings represented a discrete
    failure to meet specific requirements of the Rules.  Nor were all those
    shortcomings ones that only became apparent during the period when  the
    application was pending.  For example, the refusal letter  stated  that
    the first appellant had failed to  produce  evidence  to  show  he  had
    acquired or formed a business prior to making his Tier  1  application,
    contrary to paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A.

17.  As regards  the  judge's  treatment  of  the  appellants'  family  life
    circumstances, the grounds  are  devoid  of  merit.   There  was  quite
    clearly a close engagement by the judge with the pertinent issues  that
    arose, both under the Rules and outside  the  Rules.   The  judge  made
    clear findings rejecting the appellants'  attempts  to  downplay  their
    family ties  in  India.   The  grounds  raise  no  challenge  to  those
    findings, nor to the finding  that  the  family  could  integrate  into
    Indian society with no significant difficulties.  Whilst the grounds do
    raise the best interests of the child, they wholly fail to identify any
    error in the judge's specific consideration of these or to the  judge's
    conclusion that they could adapt to life in India  with  their  parents
    without significant difficulty.  Whilst the judge's  treatment  of  the
    family's Article 8 circumstances is open to the criticism that  he  did
    not expressly address all the considerations set out in  Section  117B,
    this observation does not significantly  assist  the  appellants  since
    whilst they both  spoke  English,  the  evidence  regarding  the  first
    appellant's   finances   did   not   demonstrate   genuine    financial
    independence; and the immigration status  of  both  of  them  had  been
    precarious at least in the basic sense that neither had settled status.
     So far as concerns the public  interest,  the  judge's  assessment  at
    paragraph 54 that it weighed significantly against the  appellants  was
    entirely within the range of reasonable responses.

18.  So far as concerns the second appellant's appeal,  the  judge  properly
    regarded this  as  largely  dependent  on  the  outcome  of  the  first
    appellant's human rights appeal.  Her period in the UK was noted to  be
    significantly less  than  the  first  appellant's  in  any  event:  see
    paragraph 51.


The Issue of the First Appellant's Section 3C Leave

19.  During the hearing we  raised  with  the  parties  whether  the  appeal
    hearing before the FtT had  proceeded  on  the  correct  jurisdictional
    basis (see paragraph 7(iii) above) as, on  one  possible  construction,
    the application the first appellant made in  February  2016  could  not
    have been a  variation  of  the  original  application  that  attracted
    Section 3C leave as it was made at a time when the first  appellant  no
    longer had extant  leave,  contrary  to  Section  3C(4).   Mr  Chohan's
    response was that the  February  2016  application  had  been  properly
    understood by the judge to be a variation permitted under Section 3C(5)
    which forms an exception to Section 3C(4).   Mr  Chohan  said  that  on
    instruction he had been informed by the first  appellant  that  shortly
    after he  submitted  the  February  2016  application,  the  respondent
    refunded the fee he had paid for his Tier 1  Entrepreneur  application.
    That, he said, reinforced his argument that the respondent had  treated
    the February 2016 application as a variation of  the  original  Tier  1
    Entrepeneur application. Mr Avery made no submissions on the issue.

20.  Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 provides:



         "Continuation of leave pending variation decisionE+W+S+N.I.
         (1) This section applies if-

         (a)a person who has limited leave to enter or remain in the United

         leave,

         (b)the application for variation is made before the leave expires,
         and

         (c)the leave expires without the application for variation having
         been decided.

         (2) The leave is extended by virtue of this section during any
         period when-

         (a)the application for variation is neither decided nor withdrawn,

         (b)an appeal under section 82(1) of the Nationality, Asylum and
         Immigration Act 2002 could be brought [, while the appellant is in
         the United Kingdom] against the decision on the application for
         variation (ignoring any possibility of an appeal out of time with
         permission),...

         (c)an appeal under that section against that decision, brought
         while the appellant is in the United Kingdom,] is pending (within
         the meaning of section 104 of that Act).

         , or

         (d)an administrative review of the decision on the application for

         (3) Leave extended by virtue of this section shall lapse if the

         [(3A) Leave extended by virtue of this section may be cancelled if
         the applicant-

         (a)has failed to comply with a condition attached to the leave, or

         successfully or not).]

         (4) A person may not make an application for variation of his leave
         to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while that leave is
         extended by virtue of this section.

         (5) But subsection (4) does not prevent the variation of the
         application mentioned in subsection (1)(a).

         immigration rules;

         be determined in accordance with the immigration rules. "



21.  Although we were not directed to  any  authority  specifically  on  the
    matter, there is a Court of Appeal judgment, JH (Zimbabwe) [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 78, in which an application made by JH to  vary  her  still  extant
    leave was made after the time when  her  original  leave  had  expired.
    Richards LJ, with Wall LJ and Laws LJ concurring, concluded  "that  the
    second application fell to be treated as a variation of the first" (see
    [46]).   This  conclusion  is  part  of  the  ratio  of  the  judgment.
    Subsequent Court of Appeal judgments on Section 3C, Iqbal and Others, R
    (on the  application  of)  v  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 838  (whose  reasoning  was  upheld  by  the
    Supreme Court in Mirza) and Khan v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 424, make no criticism of JH.
,

22.  It is common ground that the point does not affect the outcome  of  the
    appeal and as we are bound by the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in
    JH, we have not addressed it in these circumstances.

23.  For the above reasons we conclude:

    The grounds do not  disclose  an  error  of  law  and  accordingly  the
    decision of the FtT Judge is upheld.

No anonymity direction is made.





Signed                                  Date

Judge of the Upper Tribunal
