Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O Adisa
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge S H Smith dismissing his appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent dated 24 March 2017 to remove him from  the
    UK  pursuant  to  Regulation  23(6)(a)  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  3  July  1979.   He  had
    previously been issued with a residence card as the family member of an
    EEA national, Telma Lopes Rodrigues,  valid  until  11  November  2014.
    They divorced on 4 March 2013.

3.   On 21 October 2014 the appellant  applied  for  a  permanent  residence
    card on the basis that he was a family  member  who  had  retained  the
    right of residence.   That  application  was  refused,  and  an  appeal
    against that refusal decision  was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Abebrese on 23 May 2016.  The  appellant  was  consequently  left
    with no right to reside  under  the  predecessor  regime  to  the  2016
    Regulations, and accordingly was a person liable to removal.

4.   The judge considered the appellant's appeal under  Regulation  10(5)(a)
    of the 2016 Regulations which imposes a temporal  requirement  for  the
    EEA sponsor, namely the appellant's wife, to be a "qualified person" at
    the point of the divorce.  This means that the qualified person must be
    exercising  treaty  rights  at  the  point  of  the  divorce  from  the
    appellant, said the judge.  The judge also said that this is  a  matter
    which the  appellant  has  already  litigated,  unsuccessfully,  having
    failed to adduce evidence of this nature at the point of that appeal.

5.   The judge found the appellant's evidence unreliable as to  how  he  was
    able to obtain the  documents  not  through  his  ex-wife  herself  but
    through her friend who he only named as Ruth.  He  could  not  remember
    Ruth's surname.

6.   In any event the judge applied Devaseelan and held that  the  documents
    produced by him go to facts personal to the appellant in  circumstances
    when the appellant had the opportunity to provide this evidence to  the
    previous judge, but did not.  The judge held as follows at paragraph 32



    32.  It follows that the evidence adduced by this  Appellant  fails  to
         establish that his ex-wife was  exercising  Treaty  rights  at  the
         point of their divorce for the following reasons.  First, taken  at
         its highest, the self-assessment  tax  calculation  2013  does  not
         demonstrate that the ex-wife was exercising Treaty  rights  at  the
         point of divorce.  Secondly, the Appellant's  evidence  surrounding
         this document, and his wider accounts that his wife was  exercising
         Treaty rights at the point of divorce, is characterised by a number
         of weaknesses which lead me to place little weight  on  it  in  any
         event.   Thirdly,  given  there  has  been  a   previous   judicial
         determination of this precise matter, I  treat  this  new  evidence
         with the greatest of circumspection.

7.   The judge concluded that the appellant failed to  satisfy  him  on  the
    balance of probabilities that his wife was exercising treaty rights  at
    the point of their divorce.

8.   Permission was granted to the appellant on grounds  which  argued  that
    the judge erred in that he considered the law by reference to the  date
    of divorce, rather  than  at  the  outset  of  divorce  proceedings  in
    accordance with case C-218/14 Kuldip Singh and Others  v  Minister  for
    Justice and Equality.

9.   At the hearing Mr Adisa submitted the Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in
    Baigazieva [2018] EWCA Civ 1088.  The Court of Appeal  said  that  this
    appeal turned on the correct interpretation of Regulation 10(5) of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the  2006
    Regulations").   The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  question   of
    interpretation which arises in this case in relation to  Regulation  10
    of the 2006 Regulations also arises in the  same  way  in  relation  to
    Regulation 10 of the 2016  Regulations.   In  the  2006  Regulations  a
    "qualified person" meant a person who was an EEA national and in the UK
    as a jobseeker, worker, self-employed person, self-sufficient person or
    student (see Regulation 6).

10.  The Court of Appeal considered the decision in NA v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 995, which the Court of Appeal referred the following question  for
    a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of  the  European  Union
    ("CJEU"):

         "Must a third country national ex-spouse of a union citizen be able
         to show that their former spouse was exercising  treaty  rights  in
         the host member state at the time of  their  divorce  in  order  to
         retain a right  of  residence  under  Article  13(2)  of  Directive
         2004/38/EC?"

11.  In giving its preliminary ruling, the CJEU  reformulated  the  question
    to reflect the precise facts of the  case  before  it,  which  involved
    domestic violence, and posed the following question:


         "... whether  Article  13(2)(c)  of  Directive  2004/38  is  to  be
         interpreted as meaning that a third country national, whose divorce
         from a union citizen at whose hands she  has  been  the  victim  of
         domestic violence during the marriage, is entitled  to  retain  her
         right of residence in the host member state, on the basis  of  that
         provision, where the divorce postdates the departure of  the  union
         citizen spouse from that member state".

12.  The answer given by the CJEU to that question was that  the  EU  spouse
    (the qualified person) must reside in the host member state "until  the
    date of the commencement of divorce proceedings" if the  third  country
    victim of abuse is to be entitled to  rely  on  Article  13(2)(c)  (see
    paragraphs 50 to 51 of its judgment).  The CJEU did not suggest that it
    was necessary for the EU spouse to reside  in  the  host  member  state
    until the divorce itself was granted (in the system of  family  law  in
    this country, that would be by a court issuing a decree absolute).

13.  The  Court  of  Appeal  said  that  the  appellant  submits  that  this
    reasoning must logically extend to her  circumstances.   She  does  not
    claim a history of domestic violence  but  states  that  prior  to  the
    initiation of the divorce proceedings in her  case,  the  marriage  had
    lasted at least three years, including one  year  in  the  host  member
    state; in other words, she invokes sub-paragraph (a) of Article  13(2).
    She submits that in her case also it was sufficient to provide evidence
    that her spouse was a  qualified  person  up  until  the  date  of  the
    commencement of divorce proceedings and that it was  not  necessary  to
    provide evidence of that qualified person's status continuing until the
    date of the decree absolute.

14.  The Secretary of State was satisfied in the case of NA that the  CJEU's
    judgment provided sufficient guidance on  the  correct  approach.   The
    Court  of  Appeal  quashed  the  respondent's  decision  refusing   the
    applicant's application for a residence permit as a family member  with
    a retained right of residence and ordered the  respondent  to  issue  a
    residence permit to the applicant as a family member  with  a  retained
    right of residence in the UK.

15.  In the light of the Court of Appeal's decision in  Baigazieva,  I  find
    that the judge's decision cannot stand.  Indeed,  Ms  Everett  accepted
    that the judge erred in law in his decision.

16.  Ms Everett however argued that there was no evidence that  the  sponsor
    was exercising  treaty  rights  at  the  commencement  of  the  divorce
    proceedings.  She said the judge had issues with the documents provided
    by the appellant although she accepted that everyone at the hearing was
    looking at the wrong time.

17.  Mr Adisa relied on the copy of the divorce petition which he  said  was
    submitted by the appellant's solicitors to the Upper  Tribunal  and  to
    the respondent under cover of a letter dated 12  September  2018.   The
    divorce petition was issued in the Principal  Registry  of  the  Family
    Division on 5 July 2012.

18.  Mr Adisa also relied on copies of documents from HM Revenue &  Customs.
     He indicated that he had the original documents with him.

19.  Ms Everett said that because the judge had issues with the  appellant's
    evidence as to how he managed to obtain these documents, I cannot  just
    accept them and that the case needs to go back for rehearing.

20.  I  accept  that  the  judge  had  problems  accepting  the  appellant's
    evidence as to how he  obtained  these  documents.   Nevertheless,  the
    documents are from HM Revenue & Customs.  The respondent has had  these
    documents for some time and if she had an issue with  them,  she  could
    have had them verified.  She  has  not  done  so.   Mr  Adisa  had  the
    originals with him and there was no indication by Ms Everett  that  she
    wanted to see them.

21.  I am satisfied in spite of the  judge's  misgivings  as  to  how  these
    documents were obtained, that they are genuine documents and that I can
    rely on them to determine the appellant's appeal.

22.  In light of NA, the issue that  I  have  to  consider  is  whether  the
    appellant has provided  sufficient  evidence  that  his  spouse  was  a
    qualified person up until the date of the commencement of  the  divorce
    proceedings.  The divorce petition was issued on 5 July 2012.

23.  It is apparent from the documents from HM Revenue &  Customs  that  the
    appellant's EU spouse was a self-employed  person.   In  his  statement
    dated 18 April 2018 the appellant said his ex-wife was  a  hairdresser.
    She visited her customers at home to  fix  their  hair.   Some  of  the
    customers would also come to their home to have their hair done.   This
    evidence was not disputed at the hearing before the First-tier Judge on
    1 May 2018.

24.  The tax calculation for 2012-13 (year  ended  5  April  2013)  from  HM
    Revenue & Customs showed that Mrs Rodrigues had a profit  of  �6,305.00
    from self-employment.  This tax calculation fell into the  time  period
    when the divorce petition was issued.

25.  In the light of this evidence, I am satisfied that the appellant was  a
    family member with a retained right of residence in July 2012 when  the
    divorce proceedings were commenced.  Therefore, the appellant's  appeal
    against the respondent's decision to remove him from the UK succeeds.

26.  The appellant's appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
