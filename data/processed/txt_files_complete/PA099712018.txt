Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Karim of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant a citizen of Pakistan, born on 11  April  1974  appealed
    against the respondent's decision refusing  to  grant  him  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection in  the  United  Kingdom.  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge VA Cox in a decision promulgated on 20 December  2018,  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.

2.    Permission to appeal was  at  first  refused  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Saffer but subsequently granted by Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Doyle on 28 February 2019 stating that it is arguable  that  the  Judge
    gave inadequate consideration to the appellant's claimed  fear  due  to
    his ethnicity and  religion  and  also  the  Judge's  consideration  of
    Article 8 was superficial.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  because
    he did not find the appellant credible or his claim credible that he is
    at risk on his return to Pakistan because due to his role in the police
    force. The appellant's role as an officer with the ATF was  not  issue.
    The Judge did not find credible  the  appellant's  claim  that  he  was
    attacked as claimed in Pakistan or that  he  has  any  reason  to  fear
    anyone on his return. The judge also concluded that the appellant lived
    in  Pakistan  all  his  life  travelling  internationally  and   always
    returning to Pakistan, and he could live there again safely just as his
    family lives there.

 4. The grounds of appeal state that the appellant's claim is  not  limited
    to the fact that he was a former police officer but also that he  is  a
    Hazara of Shia ethnicity. The grounds complained that the Judge has not
    considered the other factors and has not  assessed  the  claim  on  the
    holistic basis. The judge was required to consider the cumulative  risk
    on return having regard to all the factors  in  having  regard  to  the
    subjective and objective evidence.  The  fact  that  the  appellant  is
    identifiable as a Hazara he would be  at  risk  from  identified  books
    which pose a risk to him.

 5. The second ground is that the judge attached to Little  weight  to  the
    report of the expert and found it not to be balanced and objective. The
    Judge has failed to consider the report as a whole as  the  contentions
    of the expert in the  previous  cases  in  which  expert  evidence  was
    provided by this expert.

 6. The third ground rejects the experts evidence relating  to  attacks  on
    police officers. This was a significant aspect of the appellant's  case
    because he states he too was attacked you to his ranking the  ATF,  his
    Hazara ethnicity and Shia religion. The  fourth  ground  of  appeal  is
    states that the judge erred by stating that  some  injury  should  have
    been left on the appellant the attack which is pure speculation and has
    not given adequate reasons rejecting the attack.

 7. The fourth ground is that the judge refers to the witness  evidence  of
    Mr Baksh I next inadequate if any credibility findings. This  witness's
    circumstances were very similar to the appellant because he is a Hazara
    who worked with the appellant  and  was  recognised  as  a  refugee  in
    Sweden. The Judge factored  into  account  the  corroboration  of  this
    witness officers in terms of risk on return. The  fact  that  documents
    from the witness were not provided is not a sufficient reason to reject
    his evidence.

 8. The sixth and last ground of appeal is that the appellant's  assessment
    of Article 8 is inadequate and downplays the delay of  the  respondent.
    Moreover, having accepted subjective and objective  matters  the  judge
    has not provided sufficient reasons for why paragraph 276 ADE (1)  (Vi)
    was not met. The Judge simply concludes that there  will  not  be  very
    significant obstacles because the appellant will be reunited  with  his
    family Pakistan without considering the  conditions  on  return  for  a
    Hazara Shia and a former ATF officer.




   Error of law discussion

 9. I have considered the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  with
    anxious scrutiny against the six grounds  of  appeal.  The  appellant's
    profile and role as an ATF officer was not disputed and accepted by the
    Judge. The judge noted at paragraph 8 of the  appellant's  witness  his
    statement he stated that he was a part of ATF  forces  who  apprehended
    some Taliban militants and was also a member of a team in large  number
    of operations. The evidence before the judge was that  the  appellant's
    wife and child live in Pakistan at the same house as the  rest  of  his
    family and continue to live there in safety.

10. The Judge cave credible reasons for rejecting the appellant's  evidence
    of an attack on him on 9 January 2013 by people on motorbikes at  10.30
    in the morning who he claims started shooting at his car. The  evidence
    was that there were speed breakers on the road in front of  each  house
    (bumps on the road). The appellant's evidence was that  he  had  a  gun
    which was in the pouch on his chest. The Judge did not find it credible
    that after having been fired and having a  gun  on  him  the  appellant
    found it impossible to use the gun as a police officer  and  not  shoot
    back. The Judge was entitled to find that the reason that the appellant
    gave for having a gun was to defend himself and yet  his  claim  to  be
    powerless to do anything when attacked by two motorcycles while he  was
    in the safety of a car. The Judge further noted that  the  speed  bumps
    were outside every person's house, it would have been difficult  for  a
    motorcyclist to negotiate them, attack the appellant in a car and  make
    off. The Judge noted the appellant stated experience  and  certificates
    of achievement and qualifications he provided relating to  motorcycling
    and basic patrolling could not identify  the  attack  is  imminent  and
    would not have taken effective evasive encounter steps especially given
    his evidence that he did not see them prior to the attack,  contributes
    to the story not being credible. These are appropriate findings on  the
    evidence.

11. There was no material error when the Judge found that a genuine account
    would have been marked by details of  any  injuries  sustained  by  the
    appellant due to the shattering glass. The Judge was entitled  to  find
    that if an attack had happened and gunshots were fired at his car, they
    would have been some description of any injuries or lack thereof and or
    the reasons why there was no injury.

12. The Judge also did not find credible that as a seasoned police officer,
    the appellant could not recall the registration plate of the  motorbike
    especially since he was at the front and  the  motorbikes  were  behind
    him. The Judge did not believe the appellant when he said that he  sped
    ahead and after a while he checked his mirror, but the bikes  were  not
    there. The Judge did not believe the appellant's  explanation  for  his
    inability to  give  a  description  of  the  men  was  because  he  was
    concentrating on saving his life. This is a  conclusion  to  which  the
    Judge was entitled. The Judge was entitled to find that the attack  did
    not happen.

13. The Judge also did not believe that the bomb  explosion  the  appellant
    claimed that happened the next day near the same  street  a  mile  from
    where he lived had anything to do with the appellant. The  Judge  found
    that not only did the attack not occur, but there was no record of  the
    bomb blast on that day as claimed by the appellant.

14.  The  Judge  did  not  accept  that  the  appellant's  family  received
    threatening letters as claimed by the appellant  because  his  evidence
    was that there are 4-5 checkpoints on the road where his family  lives.
    Furthermore, the appellant claims that his family did not  report  this
    letter to the police even though he claims to be a powerful  and  well-
    known police officer. The  Judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  it  is
    inconsistent with his claim to suggest that his family would  not  seek
    help from the police. The Judge's conclusion that the appellant's claim
    that a letter was  delivered  to  his  family  home  is  a  fabrication
    designed to bolster of false claim for asylum  this  was  a  conclusion
    open to him.

15. The Judge did not accept the appellant's claim that if  he  returns  to
    Pakistan that terrorists will kill him but  noted  that  the  appellant
    returned from Sudan to Pakistan and then flew to Karachi and that  took
    a domestic flight to Quetta airport and a taxi home. The Judge did  not
    find the appellant's explanation credible that he was travelling  alone
    and did not tell anyone. This finding was open  to  the  Judge  on  the
    evidence.

16. The judge found that the appellant's family has  lived  safely  at  the
    same house in Pakistan and did not accept the appellant's evidence that
    they do not come out of the house except in the neighbourhood, which is
    sealed, and which has several checkpoints. The appellant  claimed  that
    his children have stopped attending school for fear of kidnap  this  is
    not credible. Judge found that if a serious terrorist wished to  kidnap
    or harm the appellant's family, they would have found a way to  do  so.
    The Judge also did not believe that the appellant's children do not  go
    to school given that his brother is a  schoolteacher.  The  Judge  also
    noted that the  appellant  has  a  brother  was  a  deputy  inspector's
    general, which the appellant claimed was a high rank,  who  is  retired
    and still lives in Pakistan. The judge was entitled to  find  that  the
    appellant's family continues to live and work as Hazaras  in  Pakistan.
    The judge also concluded that if the appellant genuinely  believe  that
    his family were at risk, he would have taken  clear  steps  to  address
    that danger.

17. The Judge also did not find it credible that a man under  threat  would
    be able to travel internationally. He did not find it credible that his
    claim that simply by not telling his family and police  of  his  return
    would not protect him.

18. The Judge took into account the evidence of Mr Karim  Bakhsh  who  gave
    evidence at the hearing and claimed that he has been  recognised  as  a
    refugee in Sweden. The Judge was entitled to find that he had  provided
    no documentary  evidence  of  this.  The  Judge  was  not  looking  for
    corroboration but said that as a  police  officer  himself,  Mr  Bakhsh
    should have known that documentary evidence would be  required  of  his
    claim that he has been granted asylum in Sweden for the reasons that he
    said he has.  The  Judge  was  entitled  place  little  weight  on  his
    evidence. In any event judge was entitled to consider  the  appellant's
    case on its own merits.

19. The Judge took  into  account  that  the  appellant  is  a  Hazara  and
    considered the background evidence  including  the  expert  report.  He
    noted that there is much objective  evidence  of  the  generalised  and
    serious violence against the Hazara community Pakistan. He referred  to
    a report dated 27 November 2018 which identifies the improving  picture
    that is in accordance with other objective evidence. The many deaths in
    2013 and 2014 have reduced and the only one recent attack is  dated  30
    April 2018 and described as "apparently" because the  victims  belonged
    to the Hazara community. The picture is improving and fast moving,  and
    risks are diminished. The noted that the expert report was not balanced
    at it predicated on old figures and he cherry  picks  phrases  and  for
    example Human Rights Watch World Report in Pakistan is reduced to  2  �
    lines and fails to identify anything positive at all. This was open  to
    the Judge in his evaluation of the expert report.

20. The Judge further noted that the expert does not consider the fact that
    the appellant has worked for some 20 years with the  police  force  and
    came to no actual harm. The Judge noted that although the expert states
    that the facts are up to the Judge, paragraph 117  the  expert  assumed
    the accounts by the appellant are accepted and bases his opinion on his
    past experience as a high-profile officer. The  expert  speaks  of  the
    appellant risk of continued violence whereas the Judge found  that  the
    appellant has not experienced the risks he claims. The Judge found that
    the experts gloomy picture  at  paragraph  120  of  attacks  on  police
    officers and the police service seeing a State not caring for it, is at
    odds with the appellant's accounts of significant training,  successful
    raids, his acknowledgement and rewards as an efficient officer postings
    abroad to train others working with the United Nations and  the  United
    States government.

21. The Judge therefore was entitled to  find  on  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant can return to Pakistan and live with his  family  as  he  has
    done in the past. He  was  entitled  to  find  the  appellant  was  not
    targeted by groups he worked against or that they would be waiting  for
    him on return find him and target him on return.

22. In respect of Article 8 the Judge was aware that the appellant does not
    have family life in this country because all his family is in  Pakistan
    which is why he said that there are no  circumstances  in  this  matter
    that was him to consider the matter outside of the  immigration  rules.
    There is no material error of law the  Judge  not  to  have  considered
    Article 8 the circumstances of this appeal. The appellant is  a  failed
    asylum seeker, and, in the circumstances,  no  differently  constituted
    tribunal would find that there has been a breach of Article 8.

23. I find there has been no error of law  in  the  decision,  material  or
    otherwise, in respect of the findings made by the Judge on the evidence
    before him. I therefore uphold the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

    Notice of Decision

24.   I therefore uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  and
    I dismiss this appeal.
