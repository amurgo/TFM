For the appellant    : Mr D. Ekagha  Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent: Miss S. Sher, counsel, instructed by Mirza & Co.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The Secretary of State appeals by leave of the  Tribunal  against  the
      determination  of  an  Adjudicator,  Mr  I.M.  Scott,   allowing   the
      respondent's appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal to  grant
      leave to enter and asylum. The grounds of appeal  are  in  the  bundle
      before us.

2.    The respondent arrived  in  this  country  in  May  1999  on  his  own
      passport and immediately claimed asylum.  The basis of  his  claim  is
      set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the determination. An  uncle  of  the
      appellant's had, in about 1993, been considered by  FARC  as  being  a
      supplier of arms to a rival guerrilla  organisation.  This  uncle  had
      then disappeared and the appellant's other uncles had been driven  out
      of the area by FARC.  In 1988 they turned their attention to  him  and
      he was threatened.  He decided to leave the country.

3.    The Adjudicator has accepted the appellant as being credible  and  has
      allowed the appeal  following  the  Tribunal  determination  in  Gomez
      (00/TH/02257). The Secretary of State appeals on the basis that  Gomez
      has been misapplied.  Mr Ekagha  in  his  submissions  emphasised  the
      grounds of appeal and the claim that Gomez had been misapplied by  the
      Adjudicator.  In paragraph 14 of the determination   he  has  accepted
      that FARC would impute a political opinion to him  by  reason  of  his
      uncle's activities.  But, as Mr Ekagha points out, the uncle had  been
      killed three years previously and there was  no  evidence  before  the
      Adjudicator as to what the uncle's political  opinion  was.  They  had
      taken no interest in the respondent  until three years after the death
      of the uncle. The Adjudicator had failed to address  the  question  of
      the identity of the guerrilla  group  for  whom  the  uncle  had  been
      supplying arms, nor had he addressed the question of why it had  taken
      three years for FARC  to  catch  up  with  the  respondent.   We  were
      referred to the Tribunal determination in Gomez  and  in  Mr  Ekagha's
      submission there was no justification for the  Adjudicator's  findings
      that there was an imputed political opinion.

4.    Miss Sher in her submission maintained that Gomez  had  been  properly
      applied by the Adjudicator in paragraph 14 of the determination.   Not
      only had the uncle been killed but the other uncles  had  been  driven
      out of the area.  There was clearly a risk at the  hands  of  FARC  to
      this respondent.  The Adjudicator had accepted this and accepted  that
      FARC  was  persecuting  the  respondent.  He  had  been   accused   of
      trafficking in arms as his uncle had been.  He had been told to  leave
      the area.

5.    We raised with Miss Sher the question of internal flight and drew  her
      attention to the US State Department  Report.   We  asked  whether  it
      would be unduly harsh for the respondent to seek internal flight to an
      area not controlled by FARC and Miss Sher was not  in  a  position  to
      submit any arguments as to this. She pointed out that  the  respondent
      had gone to Bogota but had been followed there.

6.    Mr Ekagha in his submissions  drew  our  attention  to  the  interview
      notes which indicated that the respondent had  not  been  followed  to
      Bogota. The telephone calls made to the respondent  had been after  he
      had returned to his home area from Bogota. The respondent had come  to
      this country with a valid travel document and a ticket which had  been
      issued [ five days prior to his departure.

7.    In our view, the Adjudicator has not misapplied the case of  Gomez  to
      the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal in Gomez  emphasised  the
      broad interpretation that must be placed upon the term 'political' and
      in paragraph 40  states  'As  well  as  the  need  to  adopt  a  broad
      definition of the term "political" there is also a need  to  recognise
      that the term is a malleable one.' In the circumstances of  this  case
      the respondent's uncle had been supplying arms  to  another  guerrilla
      group, a rival group to FARC, and it was for that reason that  he  had
      been killed. For a similar reason, presumably,  the  uncle's  brothers
      had also been driven out of their area by FARC  which  is  clearly  an
      area controlled by FARC, as is apparent from the  respondent's   reply
      to questions at B5 at interview where he says 'All my uncles lived  in
      as village called Travesias.  Travesias is totally a guerrilla area.'

8.    Although the respondent was working at  a  domestic  electrical  goods
      company, he was perceived by the FARC  guerrillas  as  also  supplying
      arms to a rival group, as is apparent from the respondent's replies to
      questions at B4.  It seems to us, applying the principles laid out  in
      Gomez, that in the case of this respondent where his uncle had clearly
      been collaborating with a rival guerrilla  group  and  supplying  them
      with arms, the uncle would be perceived by FARC as holding a political
      opinion contrary to them in an area under their  control.   Similarly,
      they perceived the uncle's siblings as holding similar political views
      to those of the uncle who had been killed by them.  The respondent and
      his uncles were clearly  perceived  to  be  associated  with  a  rival
      guerrilla group holding political opinions different to FARC.  In  the
      circumstances of this case it is our view  that  the  Adjudicator  has
      correctly followed Gomez when he finds that FARC imputed  a  political
      opinion to him and the Adjudicator's finding in paragraph 14 is in our
      view perfectly  valid  so  far  as  they  relate  to  the  appellant's
      immediate area.  We also agree with  his findings that FARC are agents
      of persecution as the authorities in that particular area of  Colombia
      from which the respondent comes are clearly not in a position to offer
      sufficient protection.

9.    However, we do find ourselves in disagreement with  the  Adjudicator's
      findings in paragraph 13 that  this  fear  extends  to  the  whole  of
      Colombia.  We put this view to Miss Sher and asked whether  there  was
      any evidence to show that FARC would be in a position  to  pursue  the
      respondent anywhere in the country. She pointed out  to  us  that  the
      respondent had been followed to Bogota which in fact is not the  case.
      Page 10 of the interview states:

             'When I went to Bogot� I stayed with a  friend  and  tried  to
             look for work.  I went to an  agency  for  displaced  persons.
             They said I had to wait for the agency to call.  I was  trying
             to find work in Bogot�.  They never rang me back.   I  had  no
             work so I went back to my town.'

 10.  He then goes on to point out  the  instances  of  persecution  at  the
      hands of FARC that arose upon his return to  his home town.  He stated
      in his evidence (paragraph 8 of the determination) that  he  had  been
      telephoned in advance by his friend and told  not  to  go  to  Bogota.
      Persons claiming to be from FARC had  called  at  the  friend's  house
      looking for him. But this is not apparent from the interview which  we
      have quoted verbatim above.  He clearly went to Bogota, whether or not
      FARC had contacted the friend, and clearly went there for the purposes
      of finding employment and failed  in  that  endeavour.   He  does  not
      allege that whilst he was there FARC contacted him in anyway  or  that
      he was in any way harassed by them, notwithstanding the alleged  phone
      calls.  Also at interview (B5) he makes it clear that the influence of
      FARC does not extend to the townships. He states:

             'I live in Ansema.  All my other uncles  lived  in  a  village
             called Travesias. Travesias  is  totally  guerrilla  area.  it
             would be difficult to come and do the same in the town.   They
             are never in the town.'

11.   The US State Department Report would also indicate that the  influence
      of FARC does not permeate  throughout  the  state  of  Colombia.   The
      report would indicate that there  are  areas,  particularly  in  urban
      conurbations,  where  the  government  is  able  to   offer   adequate
      protection against non-state agents.  We can  see  no  reason  why  in
      these circumstances, the appellant himself not having engaged  in  the
      traffic of arms to a guerrilla group  rival  to  FARC,  and  it  being
      apparent from the evidence that the uncles who had been driven out  of
      their village had  been  able  to  find  security  elsewhere  and  not
      subsequently been pursued by FARC, that the respondent  himself  would
      equally find security and protection against persecution at the  hands
      of FARC elsewhere in the country.  We did ask Miss Sher if  there  was
      any evidence to show that it would be unduly harsh for the  respondent
      so to do. She did not make any submissions in relation  to  this.  The
      respondent is twenty-four years old had previously  been  employed  in
      the domestic  electrical  field  and  therefore  presumably  has  some
      experience in this field, and we can see no reason why he  should  not
      be able to obtain employment elsewhere  in  the  country.   He  has  a
      girlfriend and apart from this there  would  appear  to  be  no  other
      commitments to his own area and nothing which in our view  would  make
      it unduly harsh for the respondent to seek protection elsewhere in the
      country.

12.   The Secretary of State's appeal  is  therefore  allowed,  not  on  the
      basis of the grounds submitted, but on the basis that  the  respondent
      has established a well-founded fear of persecution in his own area but
      that internal flight  is  available  to  him  elsewhere  in  Colombia.
      Appeal allowed.
