For the Appellants:    Not Represented

                    Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Respondent with regard to a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Lester) promulgated on 15th July 2014. For the sake  of  clarity
    and continuity  however,  I  shall  continue  to  refer  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer as  the  Respondent  and  the  Algul  family  as  the
    Appellants.

 2. The Appellants are citizens of Turkey and are a mother  and  her  three
    children. They made an application to the Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    join their husband/father in the UK.

 3. The original  application  was  refused  because  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the marriage was genuine and subsisting,
    that  they  were  able  to  meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules  or  that  the  first  Appellant  was  proficient  in
    English.

 4. Before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  Appellants  were  represented  by
    counsel and the Judge heard oral evidence from the Sponsor.  The  Judge
    noted that before her the only issue was  the  financial  requirements.
    The Judge noted that the payslips  submitted  to  the  entry  clearance
    officer only went up to August 2013 and  therefore  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules. The Judge  noted  at  paragraph  40  of  the
    determination that Appendix FM-SE required payslips covering  a  period
    of six months prior to the date of application if  a  person  has  been
    employed by their current employer for more than six months as was  the
    case in this appeal. The Judge indicated that she  was  satisfied  that
    the required number of payslips were provided and allowed the appeal.

 5. The Entry Clearance Officer sought and was granted permission to appeal
    on the basis that the Judge, noting that the wage slips did  not  cover
    the period of six months and  that  there  were  two  or  three  months
    missing, did not indicate that they were produced and did not list them
    when she listed the documents before her in the determination.

 6. Thus the matter  came  before  me  to  decide  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had made an error of law and if so whether and  to  what
    extent her determination should be set aside.

 7. There was no appearance by either the Sponsor or  a  representative  on
    the Appellant's behalf. I caused my clerk to  contact  the  Appellants'
    representatives. They informed her that they had not  been  instructed.
    It is clear from the court file  that  both  the  representatives,  who
    remain on the court record, the Appellants in Turkey  and  the  Sponsor
    had been served with a notice of hearing at the correct  addresses.  In
    the absence of  any  explanation  for  the  Sponsor's  absence  or  any
    application for an adjournment I proceeded.

 8. No response to the  application  for  permission  to  appeal  has  been
    received. A careful examination of the  documents  on  the  court  file
    indicated that there were no payslips described as missing by the entry
    clearance officer. Accordingly on the basis that the Judge allowed  the
    appeal when the specified documents were not produced she made an error
    of law. As the Immigration Rules require the specified  documents,  the
    absence of documents  is  clearly  material  and  thus  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision is set aside. I remake  the  decision  and  in  the
    absence of the missing payslips or  any  evidence  on  the  Appellants'
    behalf the appeal is dismissed.

 9. I note that it is the Appellants' case that the Sponsor is employed  as
    a shop assistant earning over ï¿½33,000 per annum.   Notwithstanding  the
    documents produced this is a matter I  would  have  thought  worthy  of
    investigation on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer as it  seems  so
    improbable.
