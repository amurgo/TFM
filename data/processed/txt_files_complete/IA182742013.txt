Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision by the Secretary of State to  refuse  to  grant  the  claimant
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant,  and  against  her
    concomitant decision to make directions for the claimant's removal from
    the United Kingdom under Section 47 of the 2006  Act.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I do  not  consider  that
    such an order is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.



 2. The Appellant is a national of Iran.  She applied for leave  to  remain
    on the basis that she had access to  not  less  than  �50,000  and  had
    previously held leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  Migrant,  and  was
    registered as self-employed or  as  a  director,  and  was  engaged  in
    business activity in an occupation at degree level group d, as part  of
    an entrepreneurial team.  Her entrepreneurial team member was a  fellow
    Iranian, Mr Reza Shabgir.  As evidence of access to funds,  she  relied
    on a sum of �62,313 held in a bank account with HSBC.  A printout of  a
    current appointment report from Companies House showed her listed as  a
    company director, and her job title was teacher of English as a foreign
    language.  She had not yet invested any of the funds.  The date of  the
    application was 15 February 2013.

 3. On 7 May 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for  refusing  to
    grant the application.  As evidence of access to  funds,  the  claimant
    had provided bank statements from HSBC for two "North London School  of
    English Limited" business accounts.  This evidence  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix A, because there was no supporting evidence to
    suggest she personally had access to the funds.  Another deficiency  in
    the application was that  the  contract  with  students  that  she  had
    provided did not contain all the  mandatory  information  specified  in
    paragraph 41-SD(c)(iv).  The  contract  did  not  provide  the  contact
    details for the students, including their full  address,  postal  code,
    landline phone number and any email address.

 4. It had therefore been decided to refuse her application under paragraph
    245DD of the Rules as she did not meet  the  requirement  of  paragraph
    245DD(b).  In line with paragraph  245DD(l)  of  the  Rules,  the  Home
    Office had not carried out an assessment under  paragraph  245DD(h)  of
    the Rules as so her application had been refused.  But the Home  Office
    reserved the right to carry out this assessment in any challenge of the
    decision or in future applications for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) status.

The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The claimant's appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  S  Aziz
    sitting at Hatton Cross in the First-tier Tribunal on  25  March  2014.
    The claimant was presented by Mr Hodson,  and  Ms  Karbani  of  Counsel
    appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State.

 6. The judge received oral evidence  from  the  claimant,  and  took  into
    account an extensive bundle  of  documents  which  included  a  set  of
    accounts for the company for the financial year ending 31 August  2013.
    His findings of fact are  set  out  at  paragraph  40  onwards  in  his
    subsequent determination.  He was more than satisfied on  the  evidence
    that the claimant was a director in a genuine business called the North
    London School of English and that her family in  Iran  had  helped  her
    invest �50,000 into the business.  It was  also  very  clear  from  her
    testimony that  she  was  extremely  dedicated  and  committed  to  the
    business's success.  The sole reason that the Secretary  of  State  had
    refused her application was because she had not submitted documents  in
    a specified format under paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A.  The judge  was
    prepared to accept her evidence that her father had genuinely  provided
    her with �50,000 to invest in the business, and he was  also  satisfied
    that the money had now been invested in the business.   But  the  Rules
    were clear that such funds had to be held in a  personal  bank  account
    and not a business bank account.

 7. The judge went on to address a submission by Mr Hodson  that  the  bank
    account had been printed in the wrong format, and  that  therefore  the
    claimant ought to have been contacted to be  given  an  opportunity  to
    submit her bank statement in the correct format.  He held at  paragraph
    48 that the evidential deficiency was incapable  of  being  cured.   At
    best, she would have had  to  transfer  the  funds  from  the  business
    account into a personal account and then submit the new bank statements
    in order to meet the requirements.  This would result in submission  of
    evidence which only came into existence after the application was made.
     He also noted that the claimant had made clear in her evidence she had
    now exhausted much of the �50,000.   Therefore,  the  claimant  was  no
    longer even in a position to  transfer  the  funds  from  her  business
    account into a personal account.

 8. The judge also rejected a submission by Mr Hodson that the Secretary of
    State should have asked the claimant to submit contracts with  students
    which were in the correct format.  So he concluded  that  the  decision
    was in accordance with the Rules, and was also otherwise in  accordance
    with the law.  The decision not  to  request  further  documents  under
    paragraph 245AA was correct.

 9. The judge went on to address an alternative claim under Article 8 ECHR.
     He had much sympathy for the claimant.  The application of  the  Rules
    had had particularly harsh impact upon her.  She was a genuine  Tier  1
    claimant who had exhausted much of her family's earnings to help run  a
    legitimate business in the  United  Kingdom.   Her  circumstances  were
    aggravated by two further factors.

10. Firstly, as she pointed out in  her  evidence,  she  could  not  simply
    submit a fresh application, as over thirteen months had past since  she
    made her application and she had exhausted the funds provided to her by
    her family on her business.  She would no longer have any leave in  the
    United Kingdom if her application failed, and she would be expected  to
    return to Iran.  In such  circumstances,  she  had  therefore  invested
    large amount of money to  British  economy  without  reaping  any  real
    benefit.

11. Secondly, the claimant had made clear in her testimony that before  she
    made her application she sought out a good solicitor who  could  assist
    her in making sense of the increasingly complex Immigration Rules.  She
    consulted a number of firms before going with  her  current  solicitor.
    There was a letter in the claimant's  bundle  from  the  solicitor  who
    advised her on her current application.  In this letter, the  solicitor
    explained the reasons behind why she interpreted the Rules in  the  way
    she did.  Incorrect or poor legal advice could never be  a  ground  for
    allowing an appeal, but it was a factor that he took  into  account  in
    the balancing exercise under proportionality.

12. The judge held that were arguably good grounds for  granting  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules, and that there were  sufficiently  compelling
    circumstances for it  to  be  necessary  to  consider  the  application
    outside the Rules under Article 8.  The judge went on to find that  the
    appeal should be allowed under Article 8.  He directed the Home  Office
    to grant the claimant leave in line with an applicant who  had  made  a
    successful Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa application.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

13. The Specialist Appeals Team applied on behalf of the Secretary of State
    for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  They argued  that  the
    judge had made two material misdirections in law.  The first  was  that
    the judge should have considered the claimant's rights to  private  and
    family life under Appendix FM of the Rules.  The second was that  there
    were not good grounds for the judge to consider Article 8  outside  the
    Rules.   While  the  circumstances  of   the   claimant's   case   were
    unfortunate, she did not qualify under the points-based system and  her
    good immigration history and the money invested in the business did not
    amount to compelling circumstances to grant her leave  outside  of  the
    Rules.

The Grant of Permission

14. On 12 May 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Heynes granted  permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable that an error of law has disclosed the  approach  to
         Article 8, not least because the judge appears to be evaluating the
         appropriateness  of  the  Rules  rather  than  considering  whether
         exceptional factors not embraced by them.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

15. At the hearing before me, I drew the parties'  attention  to  the  fact
    that the accounts for the North London School of English for  the  year
    ended 31 August 2013 did not disclose the  investment  of  �50,000,  or
    indeed any lesser sum, in  the  company  by  the  entrepreneurial  team
    members.  Accordingly, it appeared to me that the  claimant  was  still
    within the time limit to make a fresh Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) application
    relying on the investment of �50,000 in  the  company  (as  opposed  to
    having access to �50,000 in order to invest in the company).  Mr Hodson
    agreed, and informed me that this was precisely what had been  done  by
    her fellow entrepreneurial team member.  His original application based
    on access to funds had been rejected, but he had successfully reapplied
    for leave to remain relying on specified documents to show the  sum  of
    �50,000 had been invested in the company within the past twelve months.
     Mr Shabgir, who was present in  court,  confirmed  that  he  had  been
    granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrant  on  17  May
    2014.  Mr Hodson  pointed  out  the  difference  between  Mr  Shabgir's
    position and that of the claimant was that  Mr  Shabgir  had  unexpired
    leave at the time of the original refusal, and was  therefore  able  to
    make a fresh application before his existing leave expired.

16. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Bramble relied on the following
    passage in  Patel  and  Others  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 72.   At paragraph 57, Lord Carnwarth said:

         It is important to  remember  that  article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power.  It is to be distinguished from the Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right.  The merits of
         a decision not to depart from  the  rules  are  not  reviewable  on
         appeal: section 86(6).  One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in
         Pankina for 'common sense' in  the  application  of  the  rules  to
         graduates who  have been studying in the UK  for  some  years  (see
         para 47 above).  However, such considerations do not by  themselves
         provide grounds of appeal under article 8, which is concerned  with
         private or family life, not education as such.  The opportunity for
         a promising student to complete his course in this country, however
         desirable in general terms, is not  in  itself  a  right  protected
         under article 8.

17. Mr Bramble submitted that the judge had fallen in the trap of  granting
    Article 8 relief to the claimant as a  consolation  prize,  she  having
    failed to bring herself within the Rules.  He confirmed that there  was
    a window for the claimant to make a fresh application under the  Rules,
    namely a period of 28 days from the date when her  appeal  rights  were
    deemed to be exhausted.

Reasons for finding an Error of Law

18. The judge arguably erred in law in not following a two  stage  approach
    in his Article 8 assessment: that is  to  say,  in  not  analysing  the
    claimant's private life claim under Rule 276ADE, before going on to ask
    himself if there might arguably be good grounds for granting  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules.  However, I do not consider that on the facts
    of this case there was a material error in the judge's approach in this
    regard.  This was not a case where applying the  requirements  of  Rule
    276ADE, which the claimant clearly did not meet, was  going  to  assist
    the decision maker  in  assessing  whether  there  were  arguably  good
    grounds for granting leave to remain on private  life  grounds  outside
    Rule 276ADE.

19. The judge reminded himself of the test set out in Gulshan (Article 8  -
    new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) at  paragraph  61
    of his determination. So the real issue is whether he erred in  law  in
    finding that the high threshold test for consideration of  her  private
    life claim outside the Rules was met; and/or whether he erred in law in
    finding  that  there  was  a  disproportionate  interference  with  the
    claimant's right to respect for her private life.

20. On the current state of the law, it is very difficult for a student  or
    economic migrant to mount a successful Article  8  private  life  claim
    outside the Rules as there is no human right per se to work or study in
    the country of one's  choice.   The  claimant  was  also,  on  her  own
    account, the author of her own misfortune in  choosing  to  invest  her
    family's money in the business  at  a  time  when  she  knew  that  her
    application for leave  to  remain  had  been  refused.   Moreover,  the
    claimant could recoup her  investment  by  selling  her  stake  in  the
    business, or the company could pay her an annual dividend:  in  neither
    case, did the claimant need to be in the UK. The judge did not take the
    above into account.

21. However, my main reason for finding that the decision on the Article  8
    claim was erroneous in law is that the judge fundamentally  misdirected
    himself at paragraph 69, where he said that the claimant did  not  have
    the option of submitting a  fresh  application  because  over  thirteen
    months had passed since she had made her original application  and  she
    had exhausted the funds provided to her by her family.

22. The claimant could not submit a fresh application relying on access  to
    funds in a personal account.  But Paragraph 45 of Appendix  A  provides
    an alternative route for a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).  Instead  of  relying
    on access to funds in a  personal  account  prior  to  investment,  the
    applicant can rely on the fact that he or she has already invested  the
    funds in a new or existing business.  The  requirements  for  proof  of
    such investment are set out in paragraph 46-SD of Appendix A.  The time
    constraint is that the investment should have been made not  more  than
    twelve months before the date of application:  paragraph  45.   So  the
    judge was wrong to proceed on the premise  that  at  the  time  of  the
    hearing before him it was too late for the  claimant  to  make  another
    application, and therefore the only route by which she could remain  in
    the United Kingdom in order to play an active role in the business  was
    through the grant to her of Article 8 relief.

23. In conclusion therefore the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    vitiated by a material error of law, such that it should be  set  aside
    and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

24. As I have indicated in my error of law ruling, I do not consider  there
    are compelling circumstances which justify the claimant  being  granted
    Article 8 relief outside the Rules, as it is open to her  to  submit  a
    fresh application relying on the  same  specified  documents  as  those
    successfully relied on  by  her  entrepreneurial  team  member.   Elder
    Rahimi Solicitors act for both entrepreneurial team members, and so the
    bundle of specified documents in compliance with paragraph 46-SD  which
    they have compiled for the other team member's  successful  application
    can easily be redeployed for the claimant's application.

25. Following Adamally and Jaferi, a Section 47 removal decision used to be
    unlawful.  This is no  longer  the  case,  following  an  amendment  to
    Section 47 made by Section 51 of the Crime and Courts  Act  2013  which
    received Royal Assent at the end of April 2013.  But the amendment  did
    not come into force until 8 May 2013, whereas the decision against  the
    claimant was made on 7 May 2013.  So I rule that the decision to remove
    the claimant was unlawful.  But even if I am wrong about that, I do not
    consider that the claimant being under  the  shadow  of  a  Section  47
    removal decision is a barrier to her  presenting  a  fresh  application
    within the window of opportunity acknowledged by Mr Bramble.




Decision

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
under Article 8 contained an error of law,  and  accordingly  the  following
decision is substituted: the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  to
refuse to vary her leave is dismissed under the Rules and  under  Article  8
ECHR; but the claimant's appeal against the concomitant decision  to  remove
her under Section 47 of the 2006 Act is allowed  on  the  ground  that  this
decision was not in accordance with the law.
