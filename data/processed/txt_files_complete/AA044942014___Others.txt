Anonymity
Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a
Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the appellants.
This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure to
comply with this direction could give rise to contempt of court
proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The first appellant (hereinafter "the appellant") is  a  citizen  of  Sri
   Lanka born on 20 November 1980. The other appellants  are  his  wife  and
   child. The appellants are appealing against the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal ("FtT") Judge Petherbridge,  promulgated  on  12  January  2016,
   whereby the FtT dismissed their appeal against the respondent's  decision
   to refuse to grant them asylum.

2. The basis of the appellant's claim is that  he  would  be  at  risk  upon
   return to Sri Lanka because of his (a) involvement with  the  LTTE  (both
   real and suspected) whilst in Sri Lanka which, inter  alia,  resulted  in
   him being arrested on several occasions; and  (b)  his  participation  in
   Tamil activism whilst in the UK.

3. The respondent did not accept the claim and  the  appellant  appealed  to
   the FtT, where his appeal  was  dismissed.  The  FtT  did  not  find  the
   appellant credible or accept his evidence and found that, in  any  event,
   taking his claim at its highest, he would not fall within any of the risk
   categories identified in the Country Guidance case GJ and  others  [2013]
   UKUT 00319 (IAC).

4. At the error of  law  hearing,  Mr  Wilding,  having  heard  Ms  Anzani's
   submissions, stated that he would not be defending  the  FtT's  decision.
   The parties were in agreement that the FtT had made a material  error  of
   law and that the proper course was for the appeal to  be  set  aside  and
   remade by the FtT. Given that there was agreement between the parties,  I
   will give only brief reasons for my decision.

5.  The  first  ground  of  appeal  concerned  the  FtT's  analysis  of  the
   appellant's visit to Sri Lanka in 2012, at a time when he was in  the  UK
   with Post Study Leave to Remain. The appellant claimed that whilst in Sri
   Lanka he was arrested. The FtT did not accept this. One  of  its  reasons
   for not believing the appellant, as set out  at  paragraph  [79]  of  the
   decision, was that the appellant had failed to explain  why  he  was  not
   questioned, when arrested, about his involvement in Tamil  activities  in
   the UK. It  is  apparent  from  paragraph  [79]  that  the  FtT  attached
   significance to this. However, in the appellant's  witness  statement  he
   stated that he was subjected to questioning about his activities  in  the
   UK when arrested. The FtT's finding at paragraph [79], which is  premised
   on the appellant not claiming he was questioned about  UK  activity  when
   arrested,  cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  evidence  in  the   witness
   statement, where he clearly does refer to such questioning. I agree  with
   the parties that this misdirection as to the evidence amounts to an error
   of law.  The  error  is  material  because  it  relates  to  whether  the
   appellant's claim to have been arrested in 2012  is  accepted,  which  is
   central to the issue of whether he  is  likely  to  risk  persecution  on
   return.


6. It was also accepted by Mr Wilding that the FtT failed to  make  findings
   in respect of the appellant's photographic evidence of  participation  in
   anti Sri Lankan government demonstrations.

7. Given the extent of further fact finding that will be required to  remake
   the decision I agree with the parties that the appeal should be  remitted
   to the FtT.

Decision

a. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of  law
   such that it should be set aside and the appeal heard afresh.


b. The appeal is remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  hearing  afresh
   before a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Petherbridge.
