For the Appellant:     no legal representative; sponsor present
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

No anonymity order requested or made


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge  Doyle,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  refusal  of   entry
       clearance.


    2. Mr Matthews fairly and correctly acknowledged  that  the  respondent
       and the judge had both gone wrong by  considering  this  case  under
       paragraph 301 of the Immigration Rules.   The  correctly  applicable
       provision  is  paragraph  297.   The  facts  of  the  case  met  the
       requirements of paragraph  297  (i)  (a).   (Alternatively,  if  the
       sponsor's wife was  not  treated  as  the  appellant's  parent,  the
       requirements of paragraph 297 (i) (d) were met.)


    3. The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
       appeal,  as  originally  brought  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  is
       allowed.

                                Judge of the Upper Tribunal



    In the light of the above decision, a whole fee  award  is  made  under
    rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
    Rules  2005  and  section  12(4)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.
