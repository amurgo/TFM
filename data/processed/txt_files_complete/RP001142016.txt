Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a  Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  appellant

family.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Somalia, born in July 1988.  He  entered
    the United Kingdom on 15 December  1995  and  on  7  January  1998  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain as a refugee (as a dependent on  his
    aunt who had previously been granted indefinite leave to  remain  as  a
    refugee in March 1995).

 2. On 3 December 2008, the  appellant  was  convicted  for  conspiracy  to
    inflict grievous bodily harm and sentenced to a total of  seven  years'
    imprisonment. He was sentenced to a further twelve months' imprisonment
    on 30 August 2013 for possession of an offensive weapon,  and  fourteen
    months imprisonment on 25 October 2013 for affray.

 3. Having informed the appellant of his intention to  revoke  his  refugee
    status by way of a letter dated 18 November  2015  (served  in  January
    2016), the respondent took such action on 5 July 2016. Thereafter, in a
    decision dated 18 August 2016 but served under cover of a letter of  22
    August, the respondent refused the  appellant's  protection  and  human
    rights claims, which triggered a right  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT").  On the following day a deportation order was  signed
    in the appellant's name.

Decision of the FtT

 4. The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Amin  on
    16 January 2017 and dismissed on all grounds in a decision sent to  the
    parties on 24 February 2017.

 5. Before the FtT the appellant relied upon personal characteristics which
    it was said, taken either cumulatively or in isolation, would  lead  to
    his removal breaching Article 3 and Article 8 ECHR. These included, the
    length of time since he was last in Somalia, his inability to speak the
    Somali language with any fluency or at all, his lack of family and clan
    connections in Somalia, and the unwillingness and inability of  his  UK
    based relatives to financially support him in Somalia.

 6. The FtT, inter alia, found as follows:

         "68. I accept that the appellant left Somalia when he was  7  or  8
             years old and he has not returned.  He has  been  absent  from
             Somalia for twenty years.  His entire family is in the UK  and
             he has no clan connections in Somalia.  The appellant  suffers
             from dyslexia but he has not provided  any  evidence  to  show
             what assistance he requires  with  this  disability.   On  the
             contrary, the expert report states that  he  is  above  normal
             intelligence (as an underestimate).  I do not  find  that  his
             dyslexia will  prevent  him  from  securing  a  livelihood  in
             Mogadishu.

         69.  I also reject the family's evidence today that they would  not
             be able to support him  financially  on  return  to  Mogadishu
             because they fear the money would go to terrorists.   This  is
             speculation on the part of  the  family.   The  appellant  has
             family members who are running businesses in the UK and  there
             is no reason put forward why they would not be able to support
             him on return.  The appellant initially spoke the language  of
             the country and it may take him time but he will  be  able  to
             learn the language despite his dyslexia.   The  appellant  has
             trained in prison to be a motor mechanic and he will  be  able
             to utilise such skills to obtain a job.

         70.  In  the  alternative,  the  appellant  can  also  relocate  to
             Somaliland  contrary  to  his  Counsel's   submissions.    The
             appellant's own expert has stated that it is feasible for  him
             to relocate  so  long  as  he  has  family  support.   I  have
             concluded that it is reasonable to expect his  large  extended
             family to support him on return in Mogadishu or Somaliland.

         71.   In  coming  to  my  conclusions  on  the  revocation  of  the
             appellant's refugee status  I  have  taken  into  account  the
             appellant's solicitor's submissions and the UNHCR letter dated
             8 April 2016.  However, having carried out a  full  assessment
             of the appellant's situation, I consider that the improvements
             in Somalia (relying on MOJ) since the appellant was recognised
             as a refugee are fundamental and durable within the meaning of
             Article 1C(5) of the 1951 Convention.

         72.   I  have  already  noted  above  that  in  the  light  of  the
             appellant's  convictions   his   deportation   order   stands.
             Criminality  does  not  amount  to  a   change   of   personal
             circumstances under paragraphs 339A(i)-(iv) or  a  review  may
             highlight  that  protection  is   no   longer   needed.    The
             appellant's own background  information  EASO  country  report
             notes that the number of incidents in Mogadishu  -  especially
             bomb attacks - is decreasing, albeit  still  high.   UNHCR  in
             Somalia also noted in May 2015 that Al-Shabab wants  headlines
             and therefore carries out  spectacular  attacks  against  high
             profile  targets.   Therefore  they  do  not  target  ordinary
             civilian citizens like the appellant.  MOJ noted the reduction
             in casualties amongst civilians since 2011.

         73.  MOJ also  recognised  that  there  are  no  clan  militias  in
             Mogadishu, no clan violence and no clan  based  discriminatory
             treatment, even for minority clan members.  It also recognised
             that there will  be  no  risk  of  harm  such  as  to  require
             protection under Article 8 of the ECHR or Article 15(c) of the
             Qualification Directive for an  ordinary  civilian,  like  the
             appellant, in Mogadishu.   These  are  clear  and  fundamental
             changes as to why the appellant  was  granted  refugee  status
             previously."

Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan granted permission to appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal in a decision of 11 September 2017, for the following reasons:

         "2.  The grounds of appeal are  not  well  focused  and  in  places
             concentrate on matters that are likely to be immaterial issues
             (such as the exceptions to deportation, which do  not  form  a
             significant aspect of the assessment in light of the  sentence
             of more than four years' imprisonment).  Although many of  the
             judge's findings were unarguably open  to  her  to  make,  and
             there is some question mark as to whether some of the  matters
             highlighted in  the  grounds  would  have  made  any  material
             difference to the outcome  of  the  appeal,  it  is  at  least
             arguable  that  the  judge  might  not  have  given   adequate
             consideration to some aspects of the evidence  that  supported
             the appellant's position,  including  aspects  of  the  expert
             report and the evidence given by some of the  witnesses.   The
             grounds  do  at  least  justify  further  consideration  at  a
             hearing."

Setting aside the FtT's decision

 8. At a hearing of 30 October 2017, I set  aside  the  FtT's  decision.  A
    written decision in the following terms was sent to the parties  on  14
    November 2017.

         "[9] It is first necessary to set the challenges to the  First-tier
         Tribunal's decision in the  context  of  the  most  recent  Country
         Guidance decision relating to Somalia i.e. MOJ & Others (Return  to
         Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT  00442  (IAC),  the  headnote  to
         which reads:

             "(i) ...

             (ii) Generally, a person who is "an ordinary  civilian"  (i.e.
             not  associated  with  the  security  forces;  any  aspect  of
             government  or  official  administration   or   any   NGO   or
             international organisation) on returning to Mogadishu after  a
             period of absence will face no real  risk  of  persecution  or
             risk of harm such as to require protection under Article 3  of
             the ECHR or Article 15(c) of the Qualification  Directive.  In
             particular, he will not be at real risk simply on  account  of
             having lived in a European location for a period  of  time  of
             being viewed with suspicion either by  the  authorities  as  a
             possible supporter of Al  Shabaab  or  by  Al  Shabaab  as  an
             apostate  or  someone  whose  Islamic   integrity   has   been
             compromised by living in a Western country.

             (iii)    There has been durable change in the sense  that  the
             Al Shabaab withdrawal from Mogadishu is complete and there  is
             no real prospect of a re-established presence within the city.
             That was not the case at the  time  of  the  country  guidance
             given by the Tribunal in AMM.

             (iv) The level of civilian casualties, excluding  non-military
             casualties that clearly fall within Al Shabaab  target  groups
             such as politicians, police officers, government officials and
             those associated with NGOs  and  international  organisations,
             cannot be precisely established by  the  statistical  evidence
             which is incomplete and unreliable. However, it is established
             by the evidence considered as a whole that there  has  been  a
             reduction in the level  of  civilian  casualties  since  2011,
             largely due to the cessation of confrontational warfare within
             the city and Al Shabaab's resort to  asymmetrical  warfare  on
             carefully selected targets.  The present level  of  casualties
             does not amount to a sufficient  risk  to  ordinary  civilians
             such as to represent an Article 15(c) risk.

             (v)  It is open to an ordinary citizen of Mogadishu to  reduce
             further still his personal exposure to the risk of "collateral
             damage" in being caught up in an Al Shabaab  attack  that  was
             not targeted at him by avoiding areas and establishments  that
             are clearly identifiable as likely Al Shabaab targets, and  it
             is not unreasonable for him to do so.

             (vi) There is no real risk of forced recruitment to Al Shabaab
             for civilian  citizens  of  Mogadishu,  including  for  recent
             returnees from the West.

             (vii)    A person returning to Mogadishu  after  a  period  of
             absence will look to his nuclear family, if he has one  living
             in the city, for assistance  in  re-establishing  himself  and
             securing a livelihood.  Although  a  returnee  may  also  seek
             assistance from his clan members who are not close  relatives,
             such help is only likely to be forthcoming for  majority  clan
             members, as minority clans may have little to offer.

             (viii)   The significance of clan membership in Mogadishu  has
             changed.  Clans  now  provide,  potentially,  social   support
             mechanisms and assist with access to  livelihoods,  performing
             less of a protection function than previously.  There  are  no
             clan militias in Mogadishu, no  clan  violence,  and  no  clan
             based  discriminatory  treatment,  even  for   minority   clan
             members.

             (ix) If it is accepted  that  a  person  facing  a  return  to
             Mogadishu after a period of absence has no nuclear  family  or
             close relatives in the city to assist him  in  re-establishing
             himself on return, there will need to be a careful  assessment
             of  all  of  the  circumstances.  These  considerations   will
             include, but are not limited to:

                . circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

                . length of absence from Mogadishu;

                . family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

                . access to financial resources;

                . prospects  of  securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
                  employment or self- employment;

                . availability of remittances from abroad;

                . means of support during  the  time  spent  in  the  United
                  Kingdom;

                . why his ability to fund the journey to the West no  longer
                  enables  an  appellant  to  secure  financial  support  on
                  return.

             (x)  Put another way, it will be for the person facing  return
             to explain why he would not be able  to  access  the  economic
             opportunities that have been produced by  the  economic  boom,
             especially as there is evidence to the effect  that  returnees
             are taking jobs at the expense of those who  have  never  been
             away.

             (xi) It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or  family
             support who will not be in receipt of remittances from  abroad
             and who  have  no  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
             livelihood on return who will face the prospect of  living  in
             circumstances  falling  below  that  which  is  acceptable  in
             humanitarian protection terms.

             (xii)    The evidence indicates clearly that it is not  simply
             those who originate from  Mogadishu  that  may  now  generally
             return to live in the  city  without  being  subjected  to  an
             Article 15(c) risk or facing a real risk  of  destitution.  On
             the other hand, relocation in Mogadishu  for  a  person  of  a
             minority clan  with no former links to the city, no access  to
             funds and no other form of clan, family or social  support  is
             unlikely to be realistic  as,  in  the  absence  of  means  to
             establish a home and some form of  ongoing  financial  support
             there will be a real risk of having no alternative but to live
             in makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a
             real possibility of having to live in  conditions   that  will
             fall below acceptable humanitarian standards."

         [10] Moving on, central to the first ground is  evidence  contained
         in an "Expert Case Report" authored by  Dr  Bekalo.  Such  evidence
         was, at the time of the first hearing before  the  Upper  Tribunal,
         uncontentious both in its reference to the appellant being a member
         of the Isaaq clan and in its assertion that whilst the  Isaaq  clan
         is one of the major clans of Somalia it  is  not  a  majority  clan
         within Mogadishu or within the wider mainland of southern  Somalia.
         The following aspect of Dr Bekalo's evidence has, however,  assumed
         significance for the instant purposes:

             "[2.2] ... [There is] Mistrust and animosity between the Isaaq
             clan and the majority of the rest of Somalia's  powerful  clan
             groups.   From  what  I  observe,  rightly  or  wrongly,   the
             southerners see Somaliland as the main cause for  the  breakup
             of Somalia and the chaos that followed. ... one can infer that
             it would be particularly difficult for Isaaq clan  members  to
             return and  settle  in  Mogadishu  or  elsewhere  in  southern
             Somalia.  In any case, I do not think that there would be  any
             significant number of Isaaq clan members living  in  Mogadishu
             or southern Somalia at the present time. ..."

         [11] The First-tier Tribunal summarises  Dr  Bekalo's  evidence  at
         [61] to [64], focusing on the evidence relating to the risks to the
         appellant from Al-Shabab.  No reference is made to the evidence set
         out above. Consideration by the First-tier Tribunal of Dr  Bekalo's
         evidence regarding Mogadishu and southern Somalia culminates in the
         following, at [64]:

             "Interestingly, his conclusions are that "... it also seems to
             me to be plausible that the Appellant could be  mistreated  or
             potentially exploited by the Al-Shabaab or by  other  powerful
             groups if  he  was  returned  to  Mogadishu  or  elsewhere  in
             Somalia..."  He  has   based   this   opinion   on   newspaper
             articles..."

         [12] Mr Lindsay submits that the absence of any  reference  by  the
         First-tier Tribunal to the mistrust and animosity by members of the
         majority clans in southern Somalia towards  members  of  the  Isaaq
         clan must be viewed in the context of the conclusions in MOJ -  and
         in particular those summarised at paragraphs (viii) and (xi) of the
         headnote thereto.

         [13] It is trite that Dr Bekalo's evidence must be  viewed  through
         the prism of the country  guidance  decision  but,  as  Mr  Lindsay
         accepts, that decision does not deal specifically  with  the  Isaaq
         clan.  The  reasons  and  conclusions  in  MOJ  are   clearly   not
         determinative and further analysis was required of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal.

         [14] The First-tier Tribunal concluded, at [69], that the appellant
         would be able to utilise his skills as a motor mechanic to  "obtain
         a job". Dr Bekalo's evidence (set out at [10]  above)  goes,  inter
         alia, directly to this issue. Insofar as there is any  analysis  by
         the First-tier Tribunal of the  role  that  clan  membership  would
         likely play in the ability of the appellant to obtain employment it
         is to be found in its reference to MOJ at [73], that there  is  "no
         clan violence and no clan based discriminatory treatment, even  for
         minority clan  members."  Clearly,  Dr  Bekalo's  evidence  of  the
         animosity towards, and mistrust of, the Isaaq clan  by  members  of
         the  majority  clans  in  southern  Somalia  is  relevant  to   the
         assessment of the issue of whether the Isaaq clan are an  exception
         to the general conclusions in  MOJ  that  there  is  no  clan-based
         discrimination. Whilst I appreciate that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         was not required to detail every aspect of the evidence before  it,
         it was in my conclusion required to engage with this aspect  of  Dr
         Bekalo's  evidence  and  its  failure  so  to  do  amounts,  in  my
         conclusion, to an error of law.

         [15] Mr Lindsay submits, for two reasons,  that  even  if  such  an
         error is established it is not an error capable  of  affecting  the
         outcome of the appeal. First, it is said,  the  Tribunal  concluded
         that the appellant would have the financial support of his UK based
         family members if returned to Mogadishu (at [70]) and  thus  it  is
         not reasonably  likely  that  he  would  be  required  to  live  in
         conditions which below those permitted by article 3 ECHR even if he
         did not obtain employment. Second, the First-tier concluded in  the
         alternative that the appellant could return and live in Somaliland.



         [16] A consideration of this submission requires an analysis of the
         second of the grounds of challenge, summarised at  paragraph  7(ii)
         above  i.e.  the  Tribunal  erred  in  its  conclusion   that   the
         appellant's UK based family would be able and  willing  to  support
         the appellant upon his  return  to  Somalia  (whether  this  be  to
         Mogadishu or to Somaliland)

         [17] The appellant and his witnesses gave  dual  fold  reasons  for
         asserting that there would be no provision of support from  the  UK
         for the appellant in such circumstances. There was said  to  be  an
         unwillingness to provide such support because of a  fear  that  the
         monies would end up in the hands of terrorist organisations, and an
         inability  to  provide  such  support  because  of  the  particular
         financial circumstances of the UK based family  members  (see,  for
         example, [31], [34], [38] of the First-tier Tribunal's decision).

         [18] The First-tier Tribunal rejected the evidence of unwillingness
         on the part of the appellant's family members as 'speculation'.  It
         is then concluded, at [69], that the appellant has  family  members
         in the UK who are "running businesses" and  that  "no  reason  [had
         been] put forward why they would not be  able  to  support  him  on
         return".

         [19] I can find nothing in the documentation before the  First-tier
         Tribunal, nor in the summary of the oral evidence set  out  in  the
         First-tier Tribunal's decision, to support the conclusion that  any
         of the appellant's family members "run businesses" in the  UK.  Two
         of the appellant's cousins gave evidence.  One  is  employed  as  a
         graphic designer and one is a taxi driver. Both  gave  evidence  of
         the fact that they have families of their own to support in the  UK
         and that they have no spare  money.  The  appellant's  mother  gave
         evidence of her  multiple  health  problems,  low  income  and  her
         inability to financially support her son.

         [20] Consequently, contrary to  what  is  said  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal at [69] of its decision,  the  appellant's  witnesses  did
         provide reasons in support of their assertion that they  would  not
         be able to financially assist the  appellant  upon  his  return  to
         Somalia.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  engage   with   the
         explanations provided and failed to give any reasons for  rejecting
         such evidence.  I do not accept that an engagement  by  the  First-
         tier Tribunal with the evidence would inevitably have  led  to  the
         same conclusion and I,  therefore,  conclude  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal's conclusion  that  the  appellant  would  have  financial
         support available to him upon return to Somalia is flawed by  legal
         error.

         [21] This conclusion not only impacts of the First-tier  Tribunal's
         findings in relation to Mogadishu, but also on its conclusion  that
         the appellant could return to, and live in, Somaliland, as is clear
         from the terms of its conclusion at [70]:

             "In the  alternative,  the  appellant  can  also  relocate  to
             Somaliland  contrary  to  his  Counsel's   submissions.    The
             appellant's own expert has stated that it is feasible for  him
             to relocate  so  long  as  he  has  family  support.   I  have
             concluded that it is reasonable to expect his  large  extended
             family  to  support  him  on  return  in   Mogadishu   or   in
             Somaliland." (emphasis added)

         [22] In any event, this finding is of itself also flawed  by  legal
         error for a further reason. At [64] of its decision the  First-tier
         Tribunal summarises the evidence given by Dr Bekalo's  in  relation
         to the appellant's return to Somaliland:

             "Dr Bekalo is more positive and supposes  that  the  appellant
             could or should relocate to Somaliland as there  were  no  Al-
             Shabab insurgents in Somaliland and the security situation can
             be described as far better  than  the  rest  of  Somalia.   He
             accepts that local family support or  clan  support  would  be
             essential for the appellant to survive in Somaliland."

         [23] Dr Bekalo in fact concluded that "in such  a  situation  [i.e.
         return of the appellant to Somaliland]  local  sociolinguistic  and
         cultural knowledge as well  as  clan  family  support  network  are
         critical".   Nowhere  thereafter  in  his  report  does  Dr  Bekalo
         conclude, absent all the  aforementioned  features  being  present,
         that  it  would  be  feasible  for  the  appellant  to  return   to
         Somaliland. On the face of its decision,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         has once again failed to engage with relevant evidence given by  Dr
         Bekalo."

 9. The aforementioned errors were sufficient to  lead  to  the  conclusion
    that the First-tier Tribunal's decision must be set aside.  I  directed
    that the decision would be re-made by the Upper Tribunal and  that  the
    scope of the re-making would be limited to a consideration  of  whether
    the appellant's deportation would breach Article 3  ECHR  (Ms  McCarthy
    having accepted that the appellant could not succeed on  an  Article  8
    ECHR ground absent also succeeding on Article 3 ECHR).

Re-making of the decision

Introduction

10. It is regrettable that there has been such a lengthy delay in  the  re-
    making of this decision. The case was initially timetabled to allow  an
    opportunity for Dr Bekalo to provide a further  report  -  the  further
    hearing being scheduled to take place on 19 March  2018.  This  hearing
    was adjourned upon the appellant's application, it being said  at  that
    time that the appellant's lawyers had good reason to believe  that  the
    appellant was not from the  Ishaaq  clan  as  originally  believed  but
    instead of  the  Ogaden  clan.  The  Tribunal  gave  the  appellant  an
    opportunity for this  issue  to  be  resolved.  At  a  subsequent  Case
    Management hearing the matter was listed to be heard on 25  July  2018,
    in order to accommodate the appellant's wish to obtain  further  expert
    evidence. This date was vacated upon the SSHD's request because of  the
    late service of evidence by the appellant, which  led  to  their  being
    insufficient time for the SSHD to undertake a proper  consideration  of
    the evidence prior to the date of hearing. The next available date  for
    hearing was the 3 October. On this date oral evidence was  provided  by
    the appellant and a number of  additional  witnesses;  however,  a  new
    issue arose  which  required  further  consideration  by  the  parties.
    Consequently, the appeal could not be brought to a resolution  on  that
    date and the matter  was  adjourned  part  heard  and  re-listed  on  3
    December. On that date no further oral evidence  was  heard,  and  both
    parties made submissions.

11. In coming to my conclusions below I have considered all the evidence in
    the round, including  the  evidence  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. In addition to the witness evidence  and  general  background
    documentation relating to  Somalia,  the  appellant  has  produced  two
    reports from Dr Bekelo, dated 7 December 2016  and  8  June  2018.  The
    former of these reports was before the First-tier Tribunal and is drawn
    on the basis of the appellant's membership  of  the  Ishaaq  clan.  The
    latter proceeds on the basis of the appellant's  membership  of  Ogaden
    clan. Dr Bekalo identifies his expertise in  matters  relating  to  the
    "Horn/East of Africa", including  Somalia.  He  has  authored  numerous
    academic publications on the region and discloses in  his  CV  that  he
    last visited Somalia in 2014. It is  not  specifically  stated  therein
    that he visited Mogadishu at this time, although it is stated  that  he
    has undertaken frequent  field  research  in  "Southern  Somalia".  The
    appellant also relies  upon  a  "Psychiatric  report"  authored  by  Dr
    Hajioff, a consultant psychiatrist. Dr Hajioff assessed  the  appellant
    on 7 December 2016 and authored the report the following day.

Matters not in dispute

12.  There  is  consensus  between  the  parties  as  to  the   appellant's
    nationality, age, his date of entry to the UK and his  immigration  and
    criminal history (as to which see paragraphs 1-3 above). The First-tier
    Tribunal accepted that the appellant suffers from  dyslexia,  and  this
    has not been further disputed before the Upper Tribunal.

13. Despite the case thus far proceeding on the basis  that  the  appellant
    would be considered to be from the Ishaaq clan in Somalia,  it  is  now
    agreed that this is not the case and  that  as  a  consequence  of  the
    appellant's father's being of the Ogaden clan the appellant is also  to
    be considered as belonging to this clan.

The threshold for the Article 3 ECHR consideration

14. Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention provides:

         "No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading
         treatment or punishment"

15. In Said v SSHD [2016[ Imm AR 1084, a case relating to a return to
    Somalia, Burnett LJ (as he then was), with whom the other members of
    the Court agreed, observed that Article 3 was intended to protect
    persons from their civil and political rights, not their social and
    economic rights. The court concluded that the return of a person who
    was not at risk of harm because of armed conflict or violence would not
    in the case of economic deprivation violate Article 3 unless the
    circumstances were such as those identified in N v UK [2005] 2 AC 296.
    At [18] it was said:

         "These cases demonstrate that to succeed in resisting removal on
         art 3 grounds on the basis of suggested poverty or deprivation upon
         return which are not the responsibility of the receiving country or
         others in the sense described in para 282 of Sufi and Elmi, whether
         or not the feared deprivation is contributed to by a medical
         condition, the person liable to deportation must show circumstances
         which bring him within the approach of the Strasbourg court in the
         D and N cases."

16. This approach was recently followed by the Court of Appeal in MA
    (Somalia) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 994, and it is the approach I take in
    the instant matter.  Article 3 principally applies to prevent expulsion
    where the risk of 'ill treatment' in the receiving country emanates
    from intentionally inflicted acts of the public authorities or from non-
    state bodies when the authorities are unable to afford the applicant
    the appropriate protection. It is only if "the source of the risk of
    the proscribed treatment in the receiving country stems from factors
    which cannot engage either directly or indirectly the responsibility of
    the public authorities of that country" (D at [49]), that consideration
    turns to whether there are "exceptional circumstances" of the type
    identified in D and N.

17. To further expand, the ECtHR in Sufi and Elmi v United Kingdom
    (Applications 8319/07 and 11449/07) (2012) 54 EHRR 9 identified that it
    was a relevant component of the decision in N v United Kingdom that it
    could not be said that the harm N was at risk of suffering emanated
    from an intentional act or omission of public authorities or a non-
    State body [281]. In Sufi and Elmi the Court were faced with a
    different situation, where the harm likely to be faced by the
    applicants upon return to Somalia was found to derive, predominantly,
    from the direct and indirect actions of the parties to the conflict in
    that country [282]; this being in the context of there being no
    functioning state in Somalia. It was on this basis that the Court
    distinguished the case from N v United Kingdom.

18. However, there is nothing in the evidence before me which leads me to
    conclude that the circumstances that presently pertain in the IDP camps
    or in the Mogadishu, and which it is said would lead the appellant to
    deprivation and destitution upon removal there, were brought about by
    conflict or, more generally, are the result of the actions or omissions
    of the Somali authorities. I conclude that the appropriate threshold is
    that identified in paragraph 18 of Said.

Discussion on Re-making

19. Turning then to the facts of the instant case. I accept that in  Somali
    culture the appellant is considered to be a member of the Ogaden  clan,
    which is one of the three major sub-clans of the Darod clan. The  Darod
    clan is an ethnic majority (noble) clan, with members spread throughout
    Somalia. The Ogaden sub-clan are primarily found in  southern  Somalia,
    including Mogadishu. The background evidence identifies that between 7%
    and 10% of the population of Mogadishu are from the Darod clan and that
    the President of Somalia is also from that clan.

20. In his most recent report of  8  June  2018  Dr  Bekelo  confirms  that
    "...the  appellant  would  not   face   socio-economic   prejudice   or
    discrimination on the basis of  being  from  the  Ogaden".  He  further
    states, consistently with the conclusions of the Tribunal in MOJ,  that
    Al-Shabaab insurgent groups no longer fully  control  major  towns  and
    cities such as Mogadishu, but so approach  high  ranking  military  and
    government officials as  well  as  journalists  in  cities  and  towns.
    According to Dr Bekalo, it is doubted that  Al-Shabaab  chase  ordinary
    people to forcibly join them from areas that they do not  control.  Al-
    Shabaab still carry out bombings and other  attacks  in  Mogadishu  and
    other towns and cities and some civilians have been killed. It  is  not
    asserted, however, that the level of violence in Mogadishu is of itself
    near sufficient to breach Article 3 ECHR and in any  event  looking  at
    the evidence for myself I conclude that it comes  nowhere  near  sowing
    that there is a real risk to the appellant from Al-Shabaab.

21. I now move on to consider what, in reality, was the  substance  of  the
    appellant's case before the Upper Tribunal; that in Mogadishu he  would
    be required to live in conditions of destitution such that the  Article
    3 threshold would be breached.

22. In considering this  issue  I  take  matters  in  chronologically.  The
    initial consideration must therefore be what circumstances  would  meet
    the appellant in the immediacy of his arrival in Mogadishu. In order to
    properly determine this matter, I need first  identify  what  financial
    resources the appellant would have at the point of, or  shortly  after,
    his arrival there.

23. For the reasons given below, I  conclude  that  at  the  point  of  his
    return, or shortly thereafter, the appellant would  have  available  to
    him monies provided to him by the UK authorities.

24. The Tribunal in MOJ did not consider the issue of the  availability  of
    funds from the UK authorities in any detail, merely observing at  [423]
    that:

         "Financial assistance from the Home  Office  may  be  available  to
         voluntary returnees, in the form of a grant of up to �1,500 and may
         of significant assistance to a returnee."

25. Such funds are potentially  available  through  the  operation  of  the
    Facilitated Returns Scheme ("FRS"), operated through the  Home  Office.
    The relevant guidance explaining the  Facilitated  Returns  Scheme  for
    foreign national offenders is found in a 35-page document headed:  "The
    Facilitated Returns Scheme (FRS), version 8: published for Home  Office
    staff on 3 October 2016". The introduction to this document  identifies
    that the FRS was established on 12  October  2006  to  make  the  early
    removal for foreign national offenders (FNOs) easier. The  primary  aim
    of the scheme is to encourage FNOs to leave  the  UK  at  the  earliest
    possible opportunity.

26. An application under the FRS can be made by telephone or  by  informing
    an immigration officer or member of prison  staff.  The  making  of  an
    application is not, however, treated as being compatible with  pursuing
    an appeal against deportation  and  if  the  appeal  process  is  still
    ongoing  an  applicant  is  required  to  sign  a   "disclaimer   form"
    withdrawing such appeal. This, in my view does not, of itself,  prevent
    an appeal being determined on the basis of monies being available  from
    the FRS upon return for any given applicant, and Ms  McCarthy  did  not
    seek to argue that such an approach should be taken.

27. An applicant will usually  receive  a  reply  within  72  hours  of  an
    application being made. Page 12 of the FRS guidance identifies a number
    of "categories of foreign national  offender"  that  fall  outwith  the
    scope of the FRS. In such circumstances the guidance provides  that  an
    application made by such person under the FRS "will be rejected". It is
    quite conceivable that the appellant would, in  ordinary  course,  fall
    within such categories.  To this end, between the hearings of 3 October
    and 3 December 2018 Mr Jarvis sought clarification of such matters from
    the relevant department, the consequence of which led to the  following
    undertaking being given to the Tribunal in writing:

         "In response to the UT's  questions  about  the  FRS  and  the  A's
         eligibility,  the  SSHD  is  able,  in  this  case,  to  give   the
         undertaking that on application the A will be fully  accepted  onto
         the scheme. The amount of  the  grant  is  described  both  in  the
         Reasons for Deportation Letter and  the  current  FRS  guidance  as
         �750...

         The A will therefore be given an  initial  �500  and  once  he  has
         returned to Mogadishu he can contact IOM who will then  inform  the
         Home Office which leads to the uploading of the further �250."

28. In these circumstances, I conclude that the appellant  will  have  �500
    (or the equivalent) available to him at the point of return and be able
    to access a further �250 (or equivalent)  shortly  thereafter  -  there
    being no issue taken by Ms McCarthy relating  to  the  ability  of  the
    appellant to contact the IOM after arrival.

29. Mr Jarvis asserts that in  addition  to  the  abovementioned  �750  the
    appellant will also have available to him in Mogadishu monies  obtained
    both from his UK based family members and from  non-family  members  of
    his clan living in the UK. I reject this submission.

30. The appellant's UK  based  family  was  described  before  the  FtT  as
    including his parents, five brothers, 14 cousins as well as nephews and
    nieces. I have written and oral evidence before  me  referring  to  the
    inability and/or unwillingness of the appellant's parents, two  of  his
    brothers and three of his cousins to assist the appellant if he were to
    be returned to Somalia. Having considered this evidence, I accept  that
    the appellant's parents do not have the  financial  wherewithal  to  be
    able to provide him with financial assistance. The  appellant's  father
    receives a state pension and his mother works just 16 hours per week as
    a carer. In  addition,  two  of  the  appellant's  cousins  have  large
    families of their own to support, a third has student loans to pay  off
    and two brothers referred to are both currently without  employment.  I
    accept none of these family members could assist the  appellant  if  he
    were to be returned to Mogadishu. It is further asserted by a number of
    relatives that they "do not trust the remittance services" in  Somalia,
    which was explained in oral evidence as a fear that some of the  monies
    sent through remittances services maybe diverted to assist Al  Shabaab.
    This,  is  said  amongst  other  things,  could  lead  to  the  British
    authorities taking  an  adverse  interest  in  them  -  something  they
    understandably want to avoid.

31. As to the possibility of financial support  from  other  relatives,  Mr
    Jarvis submits that the absence of evidence from these relatives should
    lead to the Tribunal to conclude that the appellant has not established
    that they would unable or unwilling to  assist  him  financially,  such
    evidence being reasonably available to the appellant but not  provided.
    I do not accept that such  a  leap  can  be  made  and,  to  the  lower
    standard, I am prepared to accept the evidence given by  the  appellant
    in this regard.

32. I turn next to Mr Jarvis' submission that the appellant could  approach
    members of his clan in the UK in order to secure financial support from
    them upon his return to Somalia.  This submission is supported,  it  is
    said, by a passage in an FSNAU report from  June  2013  titled  "Family
    Ties: Remittances and Livelihoods in Puntland  and  Somaliland",  which
    relays responses to survey about the "obligation to give".  However, in
    my view the leap from the results of  a  survey  in  2013  relating  to
    Puntland and Somaliland to the potential obligation of clan members  in
    the UK to provide financial support to the appellant (whom they do  not
    know) if he were to be returned to Mogadishu is simply too  great.   It
    is entirely speculative to  assume  that  the  appellant  could  obtain
    assistance from non-familial clan members  living  in  the  UK  in  the
    manner suggested by Mr Jarvis, and I proceeded on  the  basis  that  he
    could not.

33. Moving on, the appellant will be returned to Mogadishu airport. I  have
    not been directed to any evidence suggesting that he will,  thereafter,
    have any difficulty in travelling between the airport and  an  area  of
    Mogadishu which is largely inhabited by the Darod clan, or  indeed  any
    other area of the city.

34. As to the availability and cost of accommodation once he has made  this
    journey, this must be considered in stages. Consideration must first be
    given to whether the appellant can obtain accommodation (other than  in
    an IDP settlement) in the immediacy of his return. The analysis of this
    issue is not impinged upon by the assessment of the likelihood  of  him
    obtaining employment, given that he will return with  �500  immediately
    available to him.

35. The appellant left Mogadishu over 23 years ago, when  he  was  a  small
    child. I accept he has no ties to Mogadishu and in particular he has no
    familial connections there to support him in  his  attempts  to  obtain
    accommodation upon return. Nor is there evidence that he would be  able
    to draw upon any connections his UK based family members may have  with
    persons living in Mogadishu. Although it may be  that  clan  membership
    would be of some assistance to some returnees in finding  and  securing
    accommodation in a majority Darod area, I do not accept that this  will
    be so in the appellant's case. At present, he is effectively  estranged
    from his clan. Nevertheless, the evidence  does  not  demonstrate  that
    clan assistance is required in order to  secure  accommodation,  either
    within or outwith an area populated by Darod clan members.

36. Neither party has produced satisfactory evidence as to the current cost
    of rental accommodation in Mogadishu. The only evidence that was  drawn
    to my attention by the  appellant  in  this  regard  is  found  in  two
    documents drawn from a website named "Numbeo.com". I am not  told  what
    the purpose of this website is, nor how it collects  and  authenticates
    the data produced. The two documents from this website  are  both  from
    July 2018. The first refers to "July 2018, prices in Mogadishu" and the
    second provides  a  comparison  between  Mogadishu  prices  and  London
    prices. The former of these documents states that the price  range  for
    an apartment in the city centre ranges between $90 and $250 and for  an
    apartment outside the city centre  between  $30  and  $80.  The  latter
    document states that the rental price for a  one-bedroom  apartment  in
    the city centre is "�101.05 ($131.87)" with the cost outside  the  city
    centre said to be "�39.65 ($51.67)".  I proceed on the assumption  that
    this is said to be the monthly cost, although this is not  specifically
    stated to be the case in the documents before me.

37. Mr Jarvis also draws attention to two documents relating to the cost of
    accommodation in Mogadishu, the most recent being a Landinfo Country of
    Origin report dated 1 April 2016, in which the following is said:

         "With a three-bedroom apartment as a  starting  point,  sources  in
         Mogadishu said this costs between USD 100  and  250,  depending  on
         standard and location. The most expensive was assumed to be in  the
         district Wadajir in the area near the airport. It was  stated  that
         one has to pay USD 40 to 80 per month for simpler housing, such  as
         a dorm or a so called iron sheet house."

    It is further concluded, in the same report, that:

         "The most common way to acquire housing in Mogadishu is to enter  a
         rental  agreement.  ...The  sources  said   that   there   are   no
         difficulties finding housing in the various  districts  and  within
         the various segments of the housing market."

38. Whilst the evidence produced by the parties as to the cost of  a  small
    apartment or "simpler  housing"  (which  is  all  the  appellant  would
    require) is broadly consistent, neither party  has  produced  evidence,
    even historic, as to the cost of accommodation in the particular  areas
    populated in the majority by the Darod clan. I remind myself  that  the
    burden of proof is on the  appellant  and,  in  such  circumstances,  I
    proceed on the basis that  accommodation  would  be  available  to  the
    appellant in such areas and that its  cost  (for  simpler  housing)  is
    between $40 and $80 per month.

39. As to the costs of living in Mogadishu (other than accommodation costs)
    once  again  the  appellant  relies  upon  information  found  on   the
    Numbeo.com website and the SSHD on information reported in the Landinfo
    report. As to the latter, it is reported  that  an  IOM  representative
    "...believed that USD 400 a month would be  sufficient  to  maintain  a
    family of four in terms of food and rent..."  (my  emphasis)  and  that
    such persons would be viewed as "tolerably well off".  Turning  to  the
    first of the documents from the Numbeo.com  website,  this  provides  a
    cost range for various items, whereas the  second  document  (comparing
    London to Mogadishu), provides a single cost point in both sterling and
    US Dollars. By way of example, a litre of milk is said to cost  between
    $0.7 and $2 in the first document and "�1.13 ($1.47)"  in  the  second.
    1.5 litres of water is said to cost between  $0.2  and  $1  or  ("�0.54
    ($0.7)), 500g bread between $0.3 and $2 ("�0.77 ($1)") and  a  kilogram
    of rice between $0.8 and $1.4 ("�0.7 ($0.91)"). The cost  of  utilities
    ("Electricity,  Heating,  Cooling,  Water,  Garbage")  for  an  86  sqm
    apartment is said to range from $20 and $80  per  month  in  the  first
    document and in  the  second  document  is  identified  to  be  "�40.93
    ($56.39)". As previously indicated, there is  no  evidence  as  to  the
    source of such information, or why Numbeo.com obtained and published it
    or, indeed, why the figures in the second document do not correlate  to
    those in the first. This information does  however,  particularly  when
    taken with the information in the Landinfo report, provide a broad idea
    of the cost of living in Mogadishu and I proceed on the  basis  of  the
    information therein.

40. I further observe  that  the  appellant's  parents  each  give  written
    evidence that the cost of renting accommodation in  Mogadishu  is  �300
    per month and that the cost of living is at least �300  per  month,  in
    addition to  the  cost  of  accommodation.  During  oral  evidence  the
    appellant's mother confirmed that such information came  from  watching
    Somali TV in the UK. The appellant's father did not give oral  evidence
    or provide any explanation as to how he concluded that the  costs  were
    as he identified.  In all the circumstances I attach little  weight  to
    this evidence and, insofar as it is inconsistent  with  other  evidence
    before me, I reject it. No detail was given as to the type and location
    of accommodation it was  said  would  cost  �300  per  month,  and  the
    evidence regarding living costs is  too  broad  to  be  of  assistance,
    particularly given the other evidence put before me by the parties.

41. Drawing all this together, in  my  conclusion  the  appellant  has  not
    demonstrated that there is a real risk that he would not be  able  find
    simple accommodation in Mogadishu within the  scope  of  his  financial
    resources in the immediacy of his return, even taking into account that
    he would require sufficient funds left over to pay for  the  goods  and
    services he requires in order to ensure that his  living  circumstances
    do not fall below that which it  is  acceptable  in  Article  3  terms.
    Indeed, once he has acquired the full �750 that he is entitled to under
    the  FRS,  the  appellant  would  have  sufficient  funds  to  live  in
    conditions significantly above those that would lead  to  a  breach  of
    Article 3 for at least 4-5 months and, in all likelihood,  longer  than
    that, without access to additional financial resources.

42. Turning then to the possibility of the appellant  obtaining  employment
    upon return to Mogadishu in order to supplement the resources he  would
    already have at his disposal. In MOJ the Tribunal said as follows:

         "[345]  It  is  beyond  doubt  that  there  has  been  huge  inward
         investment, large-scale construction projects and vibrant  business
         activity.  Land   values   are   said   to   be   "rocketing"   and
         entrepreneurial members of the diaspora with access to funding  are
         returning in significant numbers in the  confident  expectation  of
         launching  successful  business  projects.  The  question   to   be
         addressed is what, if any, benefit does this deliver for so  called
         "ordinary returnees" who are not themselves wealthy businessmen  or
         highly skilled professionals employed by such people."

    The Tribunal went on to consider evidence given by  Dr  Hoenhe  to  the
    effect that a vast majority of people in Mogadishu  are  struggling  to
    survive, concluding:

         "[349] This is a view that is not altogether easy to understand and
         we are unable to agree with it.  The  evidence  is  of  substantial
         inward investment in construction  projects  and  of  entrepreneurs
         returning  to  Mogadishu  to  invest  in  business   activity.   In
         particular we heard evidence about hotels  and  restaurants  and  a
         resurgence of the hospitality industry as well as taxi  businesses,
         bus services,  drycleaners,  electronics  stores  and  so  on.  The
         evidence speaks of construction projects and  improvements  in  the
         city's infrastructure  such  as  the  installation  of  some  solar
         powered street lighting. It does not, perhaps, need much in the way
         of direct evidence  to  conclude  that  jobs  such  as  working  as
         building labourers, waiters or  drivers  or  assistants  in  retail
         outlets are unlikely  to  be  filled  by  the  tiny  minority  that
         represents "the elite"".

43.  The  Tribunal  summarised  its  conclusions  on  the  issue   of   the
    availability of employment opportunities in Mogadishu in the  following
    terms:

         "[351] ...there is evidence before the Tribunal, identified  by  Dr
         Mullen, to the effect that returnees from  the  West  may  have  an
         advantage in seeking employment in Mogadishu over citizens who have
         remained in the city throughout. This is said to  be  because  such
         returnees are likely to be  better  educated  and  considered  more
         resourceful and therefore more attractive as  potential  employees,
         especially where the employer himself or herself has returned  from
         the diaspora to invest in a new business.

         [352] For those reasons we do not accept Dr Hoehne's evidence  that
         it is only a tiny elite that derives any benefit from the "economic
         boom".  Inevitably,  jobs  have  been  created  and  the   evidence
         discloses no  reason  why  a  returnee  would  face  discriminatory
         obstacles to competing for such employment. It may  be  that,  like
         other residents of Mogadishu, he would be more likely to succeed in
         accessing a livelihood with  the  support  of  a  clan  or  nuclear
         family.

         [407(h)] ...it will be for a person facing return to  Mogadishu  to
         explain  why  he  should  not  be  able  to  access  the   economic
         opportunities that have  been  produced  by  the  "economic  boom",
         especially as there is evidence to the effect  that  returnees  are
         taking jobs at the expense of those who have never been way."

44. The evidence before me supports the continued vibrancy of  the  economy
    in Mogadishu with reconstruction and the service  industries  being  at
    the forefront of the  boom.  The  issue  though  is  how  this  instant
    appellant would fare if returned to Mogadishu.

45. In his most recent report, of  8  June  2018,  Dr  Bekalo  observes  as
    follows: (although he does so without setting the observations  in  the
    context of the conclusions in MOJ):

          i) Although one may suppose that the appellant would  likely  get
             support and protection from his fellow Ogaden members, this is
             not always the case;

         ii)  Without  established  in-country  family/clan  support,   the
             appellant is basically an outsider  and  is  unlikely  to  get
             automatic and meaningful support  and  protection  from  other
             Ogaden clan members, particularly  by  merely  mentioning  his
             name or through personal introduction;

        iii) The fact that the appellant barely knows the  Somali  language
             and culture or possesses any meaningful skills, given that  he
             has lived in the west for over two decades from a  young  age,
             further complicates his chance of integration and survival  in
             Somalia.

46. Looking at the other evidence before me, I note that in its 2016 report
    Landinfo identify that statistics about the labour market conditions in
    Somalia  are  mainly  compiled  by  UN  agencies  and  that  the   most
    comprehensive report in this field was published in  February  2016  by
    the IOM (a report that has unfortunately not been put before  me).  The
    issue of  labour  recruitment,  as  reported  by  the  IOM,  is  though
    summarised in paragraph 5.4 of the Landinfo report in which it is  said
    that for unskilled labour, potential  workers  wait  in  Bakara  market
    between 8am and 11am each morning and meet up  with  those  people  who
    need labour for various  tasks.   Agreements  for  short  or  long-term
    assignments are entered into  there  and  then.  The  report  does  not
    indicate that this recruitment process is clan based or clan biased.

47. This evidence is consistent with the conclusions both in  MOJ  and  the
    reported decision of AAW Somalia [2015] UKUT 00673, it  being  said  in
    the latter decision:

         "[64(e)]...As was made plain in MOJ & Ors, whilst it may  assist  a
         person  seeking  to  find  work  to  have  the  sponsorship  of  an
         established family  network  of  majority  clan,  absence  of  that
         support was not a disqualification to access to work."

48. Ms McCarthy submitted that given the appellant can only "speak the  odd
    Somali word and basic expressions" and is far from fluent that he would
    have difficulty in accessing the labour market in Mogadishu. Mr  Jarvis
    submits that: (i) it has not been established that the  appellant  does
    not speak Somali and, in any event; (ii) the inability to speak  Somali
    is not a disadvantage in the employment market.

49. Taking these submissions in turn. The appellant left Somalia at a young
    age and, I accept, was never schooled there. It is not  said,  however,
    that he was anything other than fluent in the Somali language upon  his
    arrival in the UK or that he spoke English prior to his arrival in  the
    UK. The appellant's claim is that upon his arrival here he  lived  with
    his aunt who "spoke English most of the time" and did not speak  Somali
    very well. The appellant also started schooling in the UK shortly after
    his arrival (aged 7). It is said that as a consequence he has lost  his
    ability to speak Somali. Indeed, in his statement of  9  November  2016
    the appellant asserts that his "first and only language in English...",
    an assertion reiterated  in  his  statement  of  3  October  2018.  The
    appellant's cousin, M, asserts that  the  appellant  "does  not  really
    speak Somali anymore".

50. On the evidence before me,  I  am  prepared  to  accept  to  the  lower
    standard that the appellant considers his first language to be  English
    and that his Somali language abilities are,  as  Ms  McCarthy  submits,
    currently limited to speaking the odd word of Somali and the ability to
    say basic Somali expressions. I remind myself however that this was not
    always the case and that it is  not  asserted  that  at  the  time  the
    appellant arrived in the UK that he spoke anything other than Somali.

51. In his report  of  8  December  2016,  Dr  Hajioff  observed  that  the
    appellant is above average intelligence, and it is also said that  this
    may even be an underestimate (para 43). It is further observed that the
    appellant was diagnosed with dyslexia in secondary  school  (para  30),
    which I accept. Despite Dr Hajioff confirming that he is not trained in
    the area (para 40) he offers the following opinion:

         "[6] He...suffers  from  marked  dyslexia  with  poor  reading  and
         writing abilities. He would, therefore, find it very  difficult  to
         learn any new language, with which he did not grow up. ...

         [41]  I  believe  that  his  dyslexia  will  make  it  particularly
         difficult for him to acquire the new language skills he  will  need
         in, what will be for him, a new country"

52. Dr Hajioff does not comment upon the appellant's  historic  ability  to
    learn the English language, and in particular how this fact sits in the
    context of the likely difficulties of the appellant now learning a  new
    language. In this regard, I note that it is said that by  the  time  of
    the appellant's mother's arrival  in  the  UK  in  1999  the  appellant
    primarily spoke the English language and that his Somali  was  so  poor
    that his aunt had to assist on occasion with communication between  the
    appellant and his mother.  In any event, Dr Hajioff does not opine that
    the appellant could not learn (or re-learn) the Somali language  merely
    that it would be difficult for him to do so  (if  it  assumed  that  Dr
    Hajioff was intending to include the Somali language in his  references
    in paragraphs 6 and 47). Nor is any detail provided in the report as to
    the likelihood of the appellant being  able  to  learn  at  least  some
    (important) aspects of a "new language", particularly in  circumstances
    in which he has previously spoken that language.  The  further  obvious
    vacuum in the report is the lack of evidence relating to the  timescale
    within which it might be possible for the  appellant  to  learn  a  new
    language. I remind myself that ultimately it is for  the  appellant  to
    make out his case, and whilst I have taken full account of the evidence
    provided by Dr Hajioff I do so bearing in mind those matters identified
    above in this paragraph.

53. As indicated Mr Jarvis submits in the alternative that an inability  to
    speak Somali would not be a disadvantage  in  the  labour  market.  The
    evidence, however, does not go as far as Mr Jarvis suggests. Whilst the
    Landinfo report identifies that English  is  viewed  as  a  'skill'  by
    employers and the evidence  also  discloses  that  there  have  been  a
    significant number of returnees from the 'West', there is  no  positive
    evidence on the issue of whether an absence of an ability to speak  the
    Somali language would be a disadvantage in  the  labour  market.  Given
    that Somali is the primary spoken language in Mogadishu, I not prepared
    to accept Mr Jarvis' submission absent  specific  evidence  in  support
    thereof.

54. Moving on, as summarised in paragraph 45 above Dr Bekalo also points to
    the fact that the appellant does not have any  "meaningful  skills"  as
    "complicating" his chances of survival in Somalia. However, given  that
    the appellant will, at least initially,  be  competing  for  employment
    against  uneducated  and  unskilled  workers  and  given  the  type  of
    employment that is on offer, the appellant's lack  of  work  experience
    and skills is not likely  to  count  against  him  to  any  significant
    degree, if at all. In any event, the appellant has level 1 and level  2
    qualifications in bricklaying, albeit he does not have the certificates
    (FtT's decision paras. 26 and 27), and he has undertaken  a  course  in
    carpentry (FtT's decision para. 24). He does, therefore, have at  least
    some skill base  relevant  to  the  booming  construction  industry  in
    Mogadishu. The appellant also has the benefit  of  two  other  positive
    characteristics that his competition is  unlikely  to  share  i.e.  his
    ability to speak English and the fact that he has been educated.

55. Drawing all the evidence together, including the substantial amount  of
    evidence before me  to  which  I  have  not  specifically  referred,  I
    conclude that there has been no material change in  the  level  of  the
    employment/economic opportunities  available  in  Mogadishu  from  that
    identified by the Tribunal in MOJ and the later  reported  decision  of
    AAW. The appellant would return to Mogadishu with sufficient  funds  to
    enable him to obtain simple accommodation and the  necessary  food  and
    hygiene products etc so as to ensure that at the point in time  of  his
    return, and for a number of months thereafter, he would not be anywhere
    close to living in conditions which fall below the Article 3 threshold.



56. The appellant is a fit and healthy  person,  able  to  compete  in  the
    market for  low  skilled  employment  in  Mogadishu.   Such  employment
    opportunities exist outwith  the  need  for  clan  assistance  and  the
    appellant has the advantage of being educated when  seeking  out  those
    opportunities. The prospects of obtaining such employment will increase
    over time, as the appellant begins to re-develop  his  Somali  language
    skills (the likelihood of which must be increased by the fact  that  he
    will be in  daily  contact  with  those  communicating  in  the  Somali
    language) and becomes integrated into Somali and clan culture.

57. The Landinfo report identifies that it is the  small  companies,  which
    are most numerous, that rely on family and clan members  to  fill  jobs
    that require  simple  skills,  this  being  as  a  consequence  of  the
    insecurity and general distrust of people from a different clan. Whilst
    I accept that the obtaining of such work will be beyond  the  appellant
    in the immediacy of his return, given his  lack  of  clan  integration,
    knowledge of Somali culture and Somali language,  no  reason  has  been
    offered as to why the appellant could not familiarise himself with  his
    clan culture and ultimately earn the  trust  of  the  clan  members  in
    Mogadishu, thus increasing his prospects of employment yet  further  as
    time goes by.

58. Nevertheless, irrespective  of  whether  the  appellant  progresses  as
    identified above I conclude that his return would not lead to a  breach
    of Article 3. I do not accept that  there  is  a  real  risk  that  the
    appellant will not obtain some form of employment in the  period  prior
    to the exhaustion of the monies he will have in the  immediacy  of  his
    return and for some months thereafter. Whilst the income levels are not
    high, with unskilled manual labourers said to earn  approximately  $200
    per month, this is sufficient to ensure the appellant would be able  to
    live in conditions which do not breach the Article 3 threshold.

59. For all these reasons, I  conclude  that  the  appellant's  deportation
    would not lead to a breach of Article 3 ECHR. As already indicated,  it
    was accepted by Ms McCarthy that there was no prospect of the appellant
    succeeding on Article 8 grounds absent succeeding on Article 3 grounds.
