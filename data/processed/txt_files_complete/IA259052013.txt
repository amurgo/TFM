                                     and


                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 10 July 2013.
    The  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal  in  a   determination
    promulgated on 22 January  2014.  Judge  Pooler  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of a letter  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  dated  11  July  2014  the
    appellant states that he wishes his appeal to be treated as withdrawn by
    the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing that the Secretary  of  State  was  the  successful  party
    before the First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent to the appellant  to
    withdraw his case.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the  appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision  shall  stand.  The  hearing  on  17  July  2014  is
    therefore vacated.




Signed                              Date:  14 July 2014
