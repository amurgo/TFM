Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent (the Applicant) is a Pakistani born on 19  August  1986.
    He is single and has no dependants.  On 15 May  2007  he  entered  with
    leave as a student.  He obtained further leave within the  Points-Based
    Scheme which expired on 10  September  2017.   On  17  August  2016  he
    applied for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant
    which  application  on  26  July  2017  he  renewed  or  varied  to  an
    application for indefinite leave on  the  basis  of  10  years'  lawful
    residence.

The SSHD's decision

 2. On 19 December 2017, the Appellant (the SSHD) refused  the  Applicant's
    application  by  reference  to  paragraphs  322(5)  and  276B  of   the
    Immigration Rules because the Respondent considered the  Appellant  had
    been deceitful or dishonest in his dealings with HM Revenue  &  Customs
    or UK Visas and Immigration or  both.   The  Respondent  came  to  this
    conclusion because on 13 September 2016  the  Applicant  had  submitted
    amended tax returns for the year ending 5 April 2011.

 3. In the original tax return  for  the  year  ending  5  April  2011  the
    Applicant had declared a self-employed income of  �12,362  and  in  his
    application for further leave under the Points-Based Scheme of 29 March
    2011 he had declared a self-employed income of �27,158.

 4. On 17 August 2016 the Applicant had applied for indefinite leave  which
    application he had withdrawn on 19 August 2016 after being requested to
    provide evidence of his tax affairs.   On  13  September  2016  he  had
    submitted an amended tax return for the year ending 5 April 2011 and on
    8 September 2017 HMRC issued a revised tax  calculation  showing  self-
    employed income of �27,158.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The Applicant appealed and by a decision promulgated on 22 October 2018
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Adio accepted the reasons given by the
    Applicant for the need to have amended his 2011 tax return and why  the
    amendments  had  not  been  submitted  until  13  September  2016.   He
    concluded the Applicant had not been deceitful or dishonest and allowed
    the appeal.

 6. The SSHD sought permission to appeal on the basis the Judge  had  erred
    in law.  It was not open to the Applicant to place  the  blame  on  his
    accountant for supplying incorrect information in his 2011  tax  return
    because he was responsible for filing a timely and correct tax  return.
    He had not explained why he had not made an appropriate  check  of  the
    information  given  in  the  original  2011  tax  return,  as  was  his
    obligation.  The SSHD relied on the judgment in R (Abbasi)  v  SSHD  JR
    [2016] UKUT 13807 and referred to the  timing  of  the  filing  of  the
    amended tax return.

 7. On 20 November 2018 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pickup  granted
    permission to appeal.

The Upper Tribunal Proceedings

Submissions for the SSHD

 8. Ms Cunha relied on the grounds and referred to the recent judgment in R
    (Shabaz Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5))  [2018]
    UKUT  384  (IAC),  in  particular  paragraphs  27(iv)  and  32-34.   At
    paragraph 16 of his decision the Judge had placed undue reliance on the
    fact that HMRC had not sought to levy any penalty on the Applicant.

 9. She referred to the test identified in R  (Shabaz  Khan)  at  paragraph
    37(iv) which states:

         "... The Secretary of State is entitled to take into account  that,
         even where an accountant has made an error, the accountant will  or
         should have asked the taxpayer  to  confirm  that  the  return  was
         accurate and to have signed the tax return,  and  furthermore  that
         Applicant will have known of his or  her  earnings  and  will  have
         expected to pay tax  thereon.   If,  realising  this  (or  wilfully
         shutting his eyes to the situation), the Applicant  has  not  taken
         steps within  a  reasonable  time  to  remedy  the  situation,  the
         Secretary of State may be entitled  to  conclude  either  that  the
         error was not simply the full of the accountant or,  alternatively,
         the Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself justifies  a
         conclusion that he has been deceitful or dishonest ..."

    The Judge had needed to look at the Applicant's  overall  knowledge  at
    the relevant time and not just the matter of the claimed error  on  the
    part of his accountant.  The Judge also  not  addressed  the  issue  of
    delay in submitting an amended return to HMRC shortly before making  an
    application to UKVI for indefinite leave to remain.  The Judge had  not
    questioned  the  character  of  the  Applicant  in  the  light  of  his
    substantial breach of HMRC's requirements.  Further, the Judge had  not
    made an assessment whether the explanation proffered by the Applicant's
    accountant was plausible.

10.  The error corrected in the amending return was substantial,  a  matter
    of some �12,300.  There was no evidence for  any  explanation  for  the
    delay in submitting the amended return but  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    comment on this.   The  references  from  several  of  the  Applicant's
    friends did not address the issues  which  were  or  should  have  been
    before the Judge.

11.  In this light the Judge's decision was not safe and so should be found
    to contain a material error of law.

Submissions for the Applicant

12.  Mr Jafar submitted the Judge had noted and set out the evidence  about
    the delay in submission of the amended return at paragraphs 6-9 of  his
    decision.  He had considered and accepted  the  explanations  from  the
    Applicant and his accountant and noted the lack of  any  HMRC  penalty.
    The SSHD had taken issue with only one tax return and the Applicant had
    address this when interviewed by the SSHD as mentioned at paragraph  10
    of his statement of 10 September 2018.

13.  He referred to the ministerial statement to the House  of  Commons  on
    the SSHD's approach to applications  for  Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain
    where there is an issue  about  an  applicant's  tax  returns  and  the
    deployment of paragraph 322(5) as a basis for refusal.  In  particular,
    he drew my  attention  to  the  comment  at  Hansard:  Commons/2018-06-
    13/debates/F984D928 at page 34 of 36:-

         "In  50  of  the  cases  we  have  considered,  there  has  been  a
         discrepancy in excess of �10,000 between the income claimed to HMRC
         and the income claimed to UKVI,  and  34  of  the  applicants  only
         sought to amend their tax returns within the  12  months  preceding
         the submission of an application."

14.  I note in the Applicant's case the discrepancy is in excess of  �10,000
    and he delayed amending the relevant tax return for several years.  The
    amendment was made shortly after the first application  for  indefinite
    leave and just within 12 months of the amended or  renewed  application
    leading to the decision under appeal.

15.  The SSHD had failed to identify what in the Judge's  decision  amounted
    to a material error of  law.   He  referred  to  paragraph  14  of  the
    Applicant's Response on the Procedure Rule 24 relying on  paragraph  21
    of the judgment of Collins J in R (Samant) v SSHD [2017] UKUT

         "... there is some force  in  submission  that  the  fact  that  no
         penalty has been imposed, which would be the case if HMRC  did  not
         take  the  view  that  there  was  any  carelessness,   let   alone
         dishonesty, then why should the Home Office, or  UKBA  as  it  then
         was, take a different view...... that it is only  if  there  was  a
         deliberate failure to produce proper  figures  that  322(5)  should
         properly be applied.  If he was indeed badly advised or if  it  was
         me carelessness,  that  would  not  on  its  own  sufficed  justify
         322(5)."

    Collins J had given weight to the  letter  from  the  accountant  in  R
    (Samant).  Mr Jafar referred to paragraph 34 in  R  (Shahbaz  Khan)  in
    which Spencer J had noted the SSHD was  obliged  to  consider  evidence
    pointing in  each  direction  and  should  justify  any  conclusion  by
    reference to that evidence.

16.  Judge Adio had set out the Applicant's immigration  history,  referred
    to the amendment of a single year's tax return and the explanation  for
    that amendment by his accountant.  The Judge had found that explanation
    innocent and given reasons for such finding.  The SSHD had  not  argued
    the case that the Judge failed to consider evidence or that  his  fact-
    finding exercise was perverse.  It was for the Judge to assess  whether
    the Applicant had been dishonest or deceitful.  While  HMRC's  criteria
    for the imposition of a penalty may not be the litmus test  for  deceit
    or dishonesty, the fact that no penalty had been imposed was a relevant
    consideration which the Judge was entitled to and did take into account
    at paragraph 16 of his decision.

17.  The 2011 return had been the Applicant's first return in which he  had
    been assisted by a student accountant who had made an "input" error and
    the Judge had been entitled to  reach  the  conclusion  that  this  was
    innocent.  There was no material error of law in the Judge's decision.

Response for the SSHD

18.  Ms Cunha emphasised that the Applicant had been under a duty to  check
    his tax return and had failed to give an explanation for this  omission
    in his witness statement and at the hearing before the Judge.

19.  She referred again to paragraph 37(4) of R (Shahbaz Khan)  and  argued
    that the Judge had not taken adequate account of this at paragraphs  14
    and 16 of his decision.  Mr Jafar interjected that this was a new point
    which had not previously been pleaded in the grounds or in the original
    submissions for the SSHD.

20.      Ms Cunha responded that the Judge had failed to  take  a  holistic
    approach to the consideration of the evidence and that the reasoning in
    paragraphs 3, 6, 7 and  12  of  his  decision  was  deficient  and  the
    decision should be set aside.  Mr  Jafar  interjected  again  that  the
    grounds for appeal argued that the Judge  had  given  undue  weight  to
    evidence but to succeed on the basis  of  the  grounds  for  appeal  as
    pleaded the SSHD had to show the Judge's findings were perverse.

Consideration

21.  The SSHD at page 3 of the reasons  for  refusal  of  indefinite  leave
    referred clearly to the possibility the Applicant had been deceitful or
    dishonest in his dealings with HMRC  or  UKVI.   The  evidence  at  the
    hearing before Judge Adio focused exclusively on the  dealings  of  the
    Applicant with HMRC.  The issue of  his  dealings  with  UKVI  was  not
    addressed in cross-examination or in submissions  and  this  is  fairly
    reflected in the Judge's decision.

22.  The SSHD's  grounds  for  appeal  do  not  raise  the  matter  of  the
    Applicant's dealings with UKVI.  Looked at in the context of the entire
    grounds for appeal, the reference to the earnings disclosed to UKVI  in
    the first ground for appeal is  based  on  UKVI  accepting  the  income
    declared to HMRC as the actual income for  purposes  of  assessing  the
    application for further leave.  On this basis and having regard to  the
    focus of the proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal, I  find  the  SSHD
    has not taken the point that the Applicant's original under-declaration
    of income to HMRC requires him positively to prove his  income  in  any
    way other than by showing what income has been declared to and accepted
    by HMRC.

23.  The "input" error referred to by Mr Jafar was  the  inputting  of  the
    Applicant's net profit as turnover  and  then  deducting  expenses;  in
    effect deducting expenses twice over.  The fact  remains  that  neither
    the SSHD nor the First-tier Tribunal has seen evidence to  support  the
    claimed net profit.  The SSHD has not pursued this latter issue at  any
    stage subsequent to the date of the decision under appeal.

24.  The Judge accepted the explanation  of  both  the  Applicant  and  his
    current accountants that the error  had  arisen  as  mentioned  in  the
    preceding paragraph and the accountants' professional view  that  since
    HMRC had not levied any penalties and the tax been paid in  full  there
    was no evidence of deceit or dishonesty on the part of  the  Applicant.
    It was not argued that the Judge had failed to  consider  any  relevant
    evidence or given inadequate reasoning for his conclusions.  There  was
    no submission of perversity on the part of the Judge.

25.  The authorities provide that the  decision  maker  must  look  at  the
    evidence in the round before reaching a  decision,  for  which  reasons
    must of course be given, to show that an individual has been  deceitful
    or dishonest in dealings with HMRC or UKVI.  The Judge did so  and  the
    grounds for appeal did not argue that  he  had  been  perverse  in  the
    conclusions which he reached.

26.  An application for permission to appeal is not the  appropriate  place
    for either party to seek to re-open  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    because of a desire to argue the case on a different  basis.   In  this
    appeal, it is evident the SSHD put his case on the basis  of  what  the
    Applicant had declared to  HMRC  and  had  not  sought  to  argue  that
    regardless of his dealings with HMRC, he had to  show  evidence  beyond
    that which was submitted with the original  application  for  leave  to
    remain to establish the genuineness of his claimed earnings declared to
    HMRC.

27.  For these reasons, the SSHD  has  failed  to  show  that  there  is  a
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and it
    shall therefore stand.

Anonymity

28.  There was no request for an anonymity direction and having  considered
    the appeal I find none is warranted.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law and shall stand.

    The effect is that SSHD's  appeal  is  dismissed  and  the  Applicant's
    appeal is successful.

    Anonymity direction not made.
