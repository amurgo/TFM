                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Grosvenor of Waldrons Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal  by  the  respondent,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    Sheffield, against a decision  of  the  First-tier  Judge  following  a
    hearing at Birmingham on 16 January 2014 who allowed the appeal  of  Mr
    Marx.   We  will  continue  to  refer  to  him  as  the  appellant  for
    simplicity's sake, and the Entry Clearance Officer  as  the  respondent
    hereafter.

2.   Without going into matters in great detail, the judge  had  before  him
    an appeal in relation to  the  refusal  of  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The
    relevant issue as it has crystallised before  us  is  the  question  of
    available savings and whether the savings that the  appellant  and  his
    wife had were sufficient to meet the requirements of the Rules.

3.   The judge in relation  to  this  noted  first  of  all  an  account  of
    slightly  over  �19,000  in  the  Yorkshire  Building  Society  in  the
    sponsor's name, �27,000 in  an  ISA  with  Aberdeen,  very  significant
    savings and investments with Hargreaves Lansdowne of a sum in excess of
    �450,000 and also referred to details of two accounts held with Charles
    Schwab and Co, and the judge concluded that  the  appellant  had  shown
    that he met the financial requirements.

4.   The Entry Clearance  Officer  sought  and  was  granted  permission  to
    appeal against this decision on the basis that the  judge  had  had  no
    regard  to  the  Rules  as  to  the  specified   evidence   which   are
    comprehensively set out in Appendix  FM-SE  to  the  Immigration  Rules
    which set out what types of evidence  are  required,  the  period  they
    cover and the format they should be in.

5.   It is common ground that the amount of savings required in a case  such
    as this where there is no employment income is �62,500 and the question
    is therefore whether the judge was entitled to find that the  level  of
    savings was met on the basis of the  evidence  that  he  assessed.   It
    seems to us that we can leave out of account, because we do not need to
    go into it, the Aberdeen ISA and the holdings with Hargreaves Lansdowne
    and concentrate on the Yorkshire Building Society Account and the first
    of the two Charles Schwab & Co accounts.  As  regards  these  accounts,
    Rule 11 and Rule 11A of Appendix FM-SE are applicable.

6.   Paragraph 11 provides a definition of what must be provided in  respect
    of cash savings, subparagraph

         "(a)  monthly personal bank statements  showing  the  cash  savings
             have been held in an account in the name of the person  or  of
             the person and their partner for at least six months prior  to
             the date of application."

     In relation to this the Yorkshire Building Society showed a minimum  of
    �19,000 during a period between 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013.  Also,
    under paragraph  11(b) there must  be  a  declaration  by  the  account
    holder of the source of the cash savings.  That  can  be  found  in  Mr
    Marx's statement at paragraph 5 where he refers to the way in which the
    savings had been accrued which is clearly satisfactory for the  purpose
    of subparagraph (b) of Rule 11 as to the  declaration  by  the  account
    holder of the source of the cash savings.

7.   Rule 11A goes on to say that the savings may be held  in  any  form  of
    bank or savings account provided that the account allows the savings to
    be accessed immediately with or without a penalty for withdrawing funds
    without notice, and the rest of that  subparagraph  and  the  following
    subparagraph are irrelevant.

8.   In relation to this we turn to the Charles  Schwab  account.   This  is
    what we might call the first account since it is the one set out  first
    in the bundle.  This covers the period 30 September  2012  to  30  June
    2013.  The lowest balance is slightly over  $107,000  and  it  is  made
    clear at the bottom of this page in the bundle that Charles Schwab does
    not restrict access to available funds  and  securities  in  the  above
    referenced account and  an  account  holder  or  authorised  agent  can
    request withdrawal from an account on demand.  In Mr  Marx's  statement
    at paragraph 17 he refers to the way in which the savings with  Charles
    Schwab & Co had been gained which again conforms to paragraph 11(b).

9.   So taking these  matters  together  we  have  a  sum  fairly  close  to
    �100,000 which is clearly therefore well above the �62,500 which in our
    view the judge properly took into account and which  conformed  to  the
    requirements of paragraphs 11 and 11A in particular of the  Immigration
    Rules.  Mr Bramble has very helpfully  assessed  these  matters  and  I
    think essentially agrees with our conclusion that no error  of  law  in
    the judge's decision has been shown and therefore the decision allowing
    Mr Marx's appeal stands.
