For the Appellants:    Mrs H Gore of Counsel, instructed by Waterdenes
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of four citizens of Nigeria.   The  first  appellant
    was born on 15  October  1983  and  is  the  mother  of  the  remaining
    appellants born on 14 June 2005, 19 June 2009 and 19 August 2007.

2.   The appellants applied on 24 April  2015  for  leave  to  remain  under
    paragraph 276ADE(iii) and Article 8 of the ECHR.  The applications were
    refused on 18 August 2015.

3.   The first two appellants entered the UK in December 2006  as  the  wife
    and child of Mr B R L who was a student in the UK.  They had leave from
    November 2006 until 28 February 2007.  An in  country  application  for
    leave  to  remain  was  refused  on  22  June  2010.   A  human  rights
    application was refused on 21 October 2013 and a further application on
    27 January 2014 based on family and private  life  was  refused  on  11
    April 2014.

4.   The third and fourth appellants were born  in  the  UK  and  have  made
    applications for leave to remain in line with those made by  the  first
    and second appellants.

5.   The respondent noted that the  first  appellant  was  no  longer  in  a
    relationship with Mr B R L although he had contact  with  the  children
    and maintained them.  While the children had resided in the UK for more
    than seven years the family could return as a unit.  Mr  B  RL  had  no
    immigration status in the UK.  The children  spoke  English  which  was
    spoken in Nigeria and they could continue their education  there.   The
    contact with Mr B R L was in the holidays and this  could  continue  by
    visits to the UK or Mr B R L could return to Nigeria.

6.   The appellants appealed and their appeal  came  before  the  First-tier
    Judge on 26 April 2017.   The  judge  heard  evidence  from  the  first
    appellant and set out her findings and conclusions as follows:

         "9.  The starting point is consideration of the best  interests  of
             the children and this must be to remain in their family  unit,
             and continue contact with their father, and to remain in their
             schools because this would  afford  as  little  disruption  to
             their lives.  None of the children has visited  Nigeria  since
             arriving or being born in the UK and only the second Appellant
             lived in Nigeria but that was up to the age of 1 �  years  and
             he cannot  remember  his  experience.   The  children  have  a
             limited familiarity with Yoruba but they could  speak  English
             in Nigeria.  The children are settled in their schools and the
             second Appellant has settled into Secondary School.


         10.  I find the first Appellant to be a credible witness.  She told
             me that now that her former husband is not working he  is  not
             able to give much maintenance for  the  children  but  she  is
             working in supermarket even though she is not permitted.


         11.  The children see their father at weekends at a friend's  house
             because he has no fixed abode.  His immigration status is  not
             settled.  He came to study accountancy but he did not complete
             the course.


         12.  The first witness used to live with her grandmother before she
             came to the UK and helped her sell food, but  the  grandmother
             is no longer able to do  this.   The  first  Appellant  has  a
             mother and siblings living in Nigeria but they  have  to  look
             after themselves and she is not really in contact with them.


         13.  The children are  healthy  but  the  first  Appellant  suffers
             sciatica and has seen a hospital consultant early this year.


         14.  It was submitted by Mr. Ume-Ezeoke that the second  and  third
             Appellants  fall  within   EX.1   because   they   had   lived
             continuously in the UK continuously for more than seven  years
             and it is not reasonable for the children  to  be  removed  to
             Nigeria.  However, the Appellants do not meet the  eligibility
             requirements and cannot fall within EX.  The  first  Appellant
             and  her  husband  did  not  have  settled  status  when   the
             application was made.  At the date of the application  it  was
             reasonable for the children to return to  Nigeria  with  their
             mother in the family unit  and  the  father  could  join  them
             voluntarily, and therefore, the first Appellant did not meet E-
             LTRPT 2.2 of Appendix FM and the children did not meet  E-LTRC
             1.6 of Appendix FM.


         15.  I find they could return as a whole family  unit,  the  father
             had no immigration status and  could  return  to  Nigeria  and
             resume contact with his children, he  would  be  in  a  better
             position to provide for them, and  there  is  a  home  of  the
             grandmother where the Appellants could reside, or  the  mother
             or other family members whilst the first Appellant  set  about
             obtaining work or starting  up  her  own  work  preparing  and
             selling food or other goods, which  is  where  her  experience
             lies both in Nigeria and in the UK.  There  is  no  suggestion
             that her sciatica interferes with her ability to work and  she
             is currently working.


         16.  The Court of Appeal in AM (Pakistan) confirmed that the  wider
             public interest is to be  included  in  the  consideration  of
             reasonableness under Paragraph 276 ADE (iv) as well as Section
             117B (6).  The Appellants  are  overstayers  and  whilst  some
             applications to regularise their immigration status have  been
             made, when refused the  family  did  not  return  to  Nigeria.
             Whilst the first Appellant's conduct is less then the  conduct
             of some of the applicants in MA (Pakistan), and  she  has  not
             committed fraud, the children also do  not  have  any  special
             needs or requirements such that it would not be reasonable for
             them to return to Nigeria with their mother, and their  father
             may or may voluntarily return with them.


         17.  I find the first Appellant has not shown that there  are  very
             significant obstacles to her integration  into  Nigeria  under
             Paragraph 276 ADE (vi) because she  still  has  family  living
             there, she lived there for many years, and she has  access  in
             the  short  term  at  least  to  accommodation  and   she   is
             resourceful, and could go and provide for the  family.   There
             is  nothing  preventing  the  father  of  the  children   from
             returning voluntarily either.  I have taken into account fully
             how  the  children  have  integrated  into  the  UK,  have  no
             experience of living in Nigeria and have not visited  Nigeria.




             I conclude the second and third Appellants have not shown that
             it would not be reasonable under Paragraph 276  ADE  (iv)  for
             them to be  returned  to  Nigeria.   I  conclude  that  it  is
             reasonable for the second and third Appellants to  be  removed
             from the UK even though they are settled into the UK, and they
             have not visited Nigeria, they have developed their own  lives
             and integrated into this country, and  their  father  may  not
             return voluntarily.  But I have found there are family members
             to ease re-settlement and the first Appellant  is  resourceful
             and can find accommodation and  maintain  her  children.   The
             children speak English and there are schools in Nigeria  where
             English is the language lessons are taught in.


         18.  Time has moved on and now all three  children  are  qualifying
             children for the purposes of Section 117B because by the  date
             of the hearing all of them have resided continuously in the UK
             for more than 7 years, and it is not disputed that  the  first
             Appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  the
             second to fourth Appellants.  The second Appellant has resided
             in the UK for twelve years, and the third Appellant ten years.
               The  children  have  settled  into  their  education,  their
             sporting interests  and  made  their  own  friends.   I  place
             significant weight upon the length of time the  children  have
             resided in the UK and the ages of the  children,  particularly
             the second Appellant who has now started Secondary School, but
             is not at a critical stage of his examination process.


         19.  I have taken into account fully the impact upon  the  children
             whose best interests lie in remaining in the UK  and  enjoying
             the continuity in their  lives.   However,  whilst  they  have
             spent a significant time in their lives in the UK, and for the
             second Appellant at significant years of  age  4  to  13,  and
             whilst I have placed significant weight upon this and his best
             interests, I  conclude  that  there  are  strong  reasons  for
             concluding that it is  proportionate  for  the  Appellants  to
             return to Nigeria as a family unit.  I have taken into account
             the wider public interest as well and when balancing the facts
             together, the family can return as a unit, the  children  will
             be able to continue their studies after a period of adjustment
             into their new life  in  a  different  country  and  different
             schooling system."

7.   The judge accordingly dismissed all the appeals.

8.   There was an application for permission to  appeal  and  permission  to
    appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on 2 November  2017.   It
    was said that at the heart of the grounds was the question whether  the
    First-tier Judge properly considered whether it would be reasonable  to
    expect the three child appellants to leave the UK.   The  children  had
    resided in the UK for more than seven years.  It was arguable  that  it
    had not been explained why the public interest in the  case  outweighed
    the best interests of the children, the policy  permitted  children  to
    remain where it would be unreasonable to expect them to leave  the  UK.
    It was argued in the grounds that the judge had  misunderstood  several
    facts relating to the children.

9.   Mrs Gore took as the first points the issue  of  mistakes  of  fact  as
    appeared in Ground 4 of the appeal grounds.  She focused  on  what  was
    said at paragraph 15 of the determination where  the  judge  had  found
    that the appellants  could  reside  in  the  grandmother's  home.   The
    appellant had said in paragraph 7 of her witness statement that she had
    no home to return to in Nigeria with three kids.  She had said that she
    was estranged from her family and had left Nigeria without the  consent
    of her parents to join a partner they had refused to have  anything  to
    do with.  The judge had found the appellant to be a  credible  witness.
    While the judge had rightly referred  to  the  best  interests  of  the
    children she had not mentioned the  witness  statement  of  the  second
    appellant who had said in paragraph 7 of his statement that the  little
    he knew about Nigeria scared him and all his friends were  in  the  UK.
    He was enjoying secondary school in England.  The third named appellant
    had been granted British citizenship on 15  January  2018.   The  issue
    raised in the grounds under Appendix FM was the one of  reasonableness.
    Further it was clear from paragraph 46 of MA (Pakistan) that  the  fact
    that the  children  had  been  here  for  seven  years  must  be  given
    "significant weight".  The issue in the case was reasonableness and the
    judge had erred in paragraph 14 in relation to EX.1.

10.  Ms Ahmad submitted in relation to the points taken on mistakes of  fact
    to the finding made in paragraph 15 about the home of  the  grandmother
    where the appellants could reside and had observed in paragraph 17 that
    the appellant was resourceful and that she had  "access  in  the  short
    term at least to accommodation".

11.   In  relation  to  the  apprehension  of  the  second  appellant  about
    returning to Nigeria it was not incumbent on  the  judge  to  refer  to
    every item of evidence and it was not shown that the judge had not  had
    in mind the  witness  statement  of  the  second  appellant.   She  had
    referred in paragraph 9 to the fact  that  none  of  the  children  had
    visited Nigeria since arriving and that only the second  appellant  had
    lived in Nigeria but that was up to the age of  1�  and  he  could  not
    remember his experience.  It was to be borne in mind that  judges  were
    encouraged to be brief in their reasoning by the Court of Appeal.

12.  In relation to the argument based on EX.1  the  ultimate  question  was
    whether the judge had erred in considering the issue of reasonableness.
      If there was an error of law it was not material  and  it  was  quite
    clear that the judge had dealt with  the  issue  of  reasonableness  in
    paragraph  17.   She  had  appreciated  that  the  test  was   one   of
    reasonableness and had taken into account all  relevant  considerations
    such as the length of time the  family  had  resided  in  the  UK.   In
    paragraph 18 the judge had taken into account Section 117B and she  had
    in effect taken the appellants' case at its  highest.   She  had  noted
    that  the  appellant  was  resourceful  and  had  been  working  in   a
    supermarket although she had not been permitted  to  do  so  and  would
    accordingly be able to maintain the children in Nigeria.

13.  In reply Mrs  Gore  submitted  that  in  paragraph  14  the  judge  had
    referred to reasonableness in the context of the date  of  application.
    She had failed to remind herself of paragraph 49 of MA (Pakistan) - the
    fact that a child had been in the UK for seven years would need  to  be
    given significant weight.  There had been no fraud in contrast with  MA
    (Pakistan).  The children would be faced with destitution on return.

14.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the determination of  the  First-
    tier Judge if it was materially flawed in law.

15.  The determination is succinct but none the worse for that  and  I  have
    set out the judge's reasoning above.  Firstly, I see no basis  for  the
    argument that the judge did not have proper regard to the case  law  to
    which she refers.  It is plain, for example, that she was aware of what
    had been said in MA (Pakistan) about  the  need  to  place  significant
    weight to the length of residence of the  children  in  the  UK  -  see
    paragraph 18 of the determination.

16.  Mrs Gore concentrated on the mistake of fact  argument.   She  referred
    to extracts from the witness statement of the first appellant whom  she
    had found to be a  credible  witness.   I  do  not  find  any  material
    inconsistency between the judge's analysis of the evidence before  her.
    The judge was exploring various options in paragraph 15 of her decision
    about what the family could do on return.  As Ms Ahmad pointed out  the
    judge  had  been  fully  entitled  to  find  that  the  appellant   was
    resourceful and it was open to her to conclude that she  could  provide
    for the family on return.  There would be access "in the short term  at
    least" to accommodation.  It was open to her to find  that  there  were
    family members to ease resettlement.  The appellant would  be  able  to
    find accommodation and maintain her children.

17.  I am not satisfied that the judge misdirected herself on the facts  and
    she bore in mind all salient  considerations  going  to  the  issue  of
    reasonableness and the best interests of the  children.  Other  factual
    points were put forward in the grounds - for example  that  the  second
    appellant arrived in the UK at the age of 1 � rather than 4 - but these
    were not developed at the hearing, rightly in my view, and  they  raise
    no material error of law.

18.   I am not satisfied that the judge's positive credibility  finding  was
    inconsistent with  her  analysis  of  the  evidence.   I  do  not  find
    furthermore that there was any material misdirection on  the  issue  of
    reasonableness in the context of EX.1. When the determination  is  read
    as a whole it is plain and apparent that the judge took full account of
    the reasonableness of returning the children, not merely at the date of
    application or the date of the decision but at the date of the hearing.
