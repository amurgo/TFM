For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Walker
    made on the papers on 4th February 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 10th September 1982.  He
    entered the UK on 21st January 2011 with entry clearance as  a  student
    valid to 20th April 2012.  On 19th April 2012 he applied for  leave  to
    remain in the UK as the spouse of a British citizen.   The  application
    was refused on  6th  November  2012  because  the  Respondent  was  not
    satisfied either that the Appellant was legally  married  to  a  person
    present and settled in the UK or that the marriage  was  subsisting  or
    that the couple intended to live together.

 3. The Appellant appealed against the decision but elected not to  request
    an oral hearing, and his appeal was  dismissed  on  the  basis  of  the
    papers before the judge.

 4. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had overlooked the Sponsor's evidence. Misleadingly the  grounds  refer
    to her oral evidence but also to the fact that she submitted a  written
    statement.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by  Designated  Judge  Peart  on  22nd
    February 2013 for the reasons stated in the grounds.

 6. The Respondent served a reply on 21st March 2013 without sight  of  the
    file, defending the determination.  However when Mrs Pettersen had  had
    an opportunity to look at the file it was  apparent  to  her  that  the
    statement had been overlooked, and she conceded that the decision would
    have to be remade.

 7. The determination is set aside because the judge failed  to  take  into
    account relevant evidence when deciding the appeal.

The Hearing

The oral evidence

 8. Mr Hussain adopted his statement to stand as his evidence-in-chief.  He
    said that the couple were married  Islamically  and  did  not  feel  it
    necessary to register the marriage until the Home Office asked them  to
    do so. He produced an English marriage certificate.

 9. The Appellant said that he knew his wife from Pakistan.  He came to the
    UK on 22nd January 2011 and the Sponsor Yasmin Kausar came to meet  him
    in Watford on the same day.  A few days  later  they  started  to  live
    together.  They had met a couple of times before in Pakistan, the first
    time for three or four weeks and the second time for a  month.  He  was
    asked whether the couple had lived together in Pakistan. He  said  that
    they had gone to a hotel and visited historical places  but  they  were
    not alone and did not live as husband and wife because they had a joint
    family system there. He and Yasmin came from the same background.

10. Mrs Pettersen took him through the documents which he had  produced  to
    support his application.  The Appellant claims to live at 559 Abbeydale
    Road Sheffield. He said that he was living at 75 Rupert Road  Sheffield
    until August 2011 but had been   at  Abbeydale  Road  ever  since.  The
    couple live in a tenanted property and most of the household bills  are
    addressed to the landlord,  Mr  S  Quader,  the  person  named  on  the
    shorthold tenancy agreement. It  was  put  to  him  that  he  had  also
    produced a council tax adjustment notice in the name of Sayeed Mohammed
    for the same address dated July  2010.   The  Appellant  said  that  he
    thought they lived there and that the council tax was registered in his
    name but he did not ask.  When asked how he got  a  document  for  2010
    when he did not move in until 2011  he  said  that  he  was  given  two
    documents and he did not know anything about the council  tax  he  just
    paid his rent.

11. The Sponsor has produced bank statements for the period September  2011
    to December 2011 when she gave an address in Leicester.  The  Appellant
    said that that was his wife's parent's address. She has also provided a
    bank statement covering the period from August 2011 to August 2012 when
    her address was given in Wakefield.  The Appellant said  that  she  had
    aunt there and he thought that she lived there for a few weeks, may  be
    three or for months, visiting him at weekends.  She was  looking  after
    her aunt who did not have any children of her own.   He  repeated  that
    his wife had started living with him in January/February 2011.

12. The Sponsor  has  also  produced  a  number  of  payslips  showing  her
    employment with Care Watch  Leicester  for  the  period  July  2011  to
    February 2012.  The Appellant said that she lost that job and had a new
    job with Network Taxis.  There is a letter in  the  file  from  Network
    Taxis dated 12th September 2012 giving the  Sponsor's  address  as  559
    Abbeydale Road, Sheffield.  The Appellant was unclear when she  started
    working there, but he thought it was a few months  after  she  came  to
    him, possibly in the middle of 2012.  He said that she was paid weekly,
    around �200 to �250 per week, but he had not asked.

13. The Appellant maintained that he had undergone a  Nikka  ceremony  with
    Yasmin Kausar on 17th July 2011.  He said that he called the Maulvi  to
    his house. Two of his friends  were  witnesses,  Mohamed  Shafaqat  and
    Ansir Khan.  Someone called Raqeeb was there for his wife.

14. The Appellant was asked whether Yasmin had any illnesses.  He said that
    she was pregnant and he thought that the baby was due in seven or eight
    months but he did not bring  a  doctor's  report  because  no  one  had
    required it.  He could get evidence if required.  She had lost  a  baby
    seven or eight months ago when she had fallen down stairs  because  she
    was depressed.

15. Yasmin Kausar also gave evidence.  She was asked when she first met the
    Appellant and she said that they had met in  Watford.   She  had  never
    been abroad and never been to Pakistan.  When it was put  to  her  that
    the Appellant had said that they had met in Pakistan she said that they
    used to speak on the phone.

16. She was asked about the Nikka ceremony. She said that her  brother  was
    present, Amar Star, and her husband had two friends there but she could
    not remember their names. There was also a family friend called  Raqeeb
    Alam.

17. The various addresses on the bank statements  were  put  to  her.   The
    Sponsor said that she had gone to Wakefield  because  she  had  had  an
    argument with her mother and changed to her aunt's address.  So far  as
    her work was concerned, she had moved to  working  with  Berrystead  in
    Sheffield two months ago and before that she was working for Home  Care
    in Leicester but that finished at the beginning of 2012.

18. Finally, she maintained that she was pregnant but the doctor would  not
    give her any report because of confidentiality issues.  She had had two
    miscarriages because of the stress of her husband's visa.

Submissions

19. Unsurprisingly Mrs Pettersen submitted that the evidence given  by  the
    witnesses was wholly discrepant and  unreliable  and  that  the  appeal
    ought to be dismissed.

20. Miss Mahmood maintained that both parties had lived  together  for  two
    years and it would  be  possible  to  get  evidence  of  the  Sponsor's
    pregnancy. They  had  provided  evidence  in  the  form  of  a  tenancy
    agreement to show that they were under one roof and she relied  on  the
    evidence which had been  produced in support of the appeal.

Findings and Conclusions

21. I make the following findings of fact.

      a) At the date of decision this couple had not entered  into  a  valid
         marriage recognised in the UK. The  registry  office  wedding  only
         took place on 17th December 2012.

      b) This is a marriage in form only with no  substance.   The  evidence
         between the witnesses was wholly contradictory.  The Appellant said
         that they met in Pakistan prior to his arrival in the UK  in  2011.
         The Sponsor said that she had never been to Pakistan.  The evidence
         from the bank statement  shows  that  the  Sponsor  was  living  in
         Leicester and for a time in Wakefield, but not Sheffield.

      c) The Sponsor said that she had worked as a care worker in  Leicester
         before taking up recent work in Sheffield with Berrystead. She  has
         produced payslips  showing that she worked in Leicester.  The  only
         evidence of her work in Sheffield is a letter  from  Network  Taxis
         but the Sponsor failed to  mention that employment at all.  I  find
         that she has never worked in Sheffield. Nor does she live there.

      d) The parties state that they underwent a Nikka ceremony in July 2011
         but have produced no evidence of that ceremony and  their  evidence
         about it was discrepant. The Appellant named two  individuals  whom
         he said were witnesses who were not named by the Sponsor.

      e) The witnesses claimed that the Sponsor was  pregnant  but  produced
         absolutely no evidence to confirm the  pregnancy.   It  would  have
         been open to the Sponsor to obtain that evidence had she wished  to
         do so.  I find that she is not pregnant as clamed.

22. I conclude that the Appellant has sought to put  forward  a  fraudulent
    claim to be in a genuine and subsisting relationship with the  Sponsor.
    I find that their marriage is not subsisting, that  they  do  not  live
    together and there is no intention to do so in the future.

23. With respect to Article 8 there is no family life between this  couple.
    Although they have undergone a registry office marriage,  the  marriage
    is in name only and has no substance. The Appellant has been in the  UK
    for a short period of time, originally for  a  temporary  purpose,  and
    sought  to  remain  here  by  attempting  to  deceive  the  immigration
    authorities. Article 8 is not engaged.

Decision

24. The decision of the judge has been set aside. It is remade as  follows.
    The Appellant's appeal is dismissed under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    with respect to Article 8.
