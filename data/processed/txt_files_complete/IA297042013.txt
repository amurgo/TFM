Representation:

For the Claimant: Mr Khan, Universal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent appeals with permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Powell  promulgated  on  30  January  2014
    allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision of  the  respondent
    made on 2 July 2013 to refuse him leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

 2. The claimant entered the United Kingdom on  7  March  2011  with  entry
    clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student, valid until 30  October  2012.
    On that date he made an application for leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant on the  basis  that  he  had
    ï¿½200,000 available to invest which was being provided by Mr Protap  Lal
    Beghi, the sums being held in Rupali Bank Limited in Bangladesh.   That
    application was supported by bank statements and a letter  from  Rupali
    Bank,  a  declaration  from  Mr  Beghi  and  a  letter  from  a   legal
    representative confirming the validity of the signatures of the  people
    included in that declaration.  The respondent refused  the  application
    on the basis that:-

      i) the letter  from  Rupali  Bank  Limited  did  not  have  a  contact
         telephone number or any email address of the third party;

     ii) that the third party declaration for Mr Beghi was not acceptable as
         it had been altered with correction fluid  and  thus  the  original
         declaration might not have contained the  information  relating  to
         the appellant; and

    iii) that the legal representative's letter did not include  within  it,
         as was required, the expiry date of the identity card of the  third
         party, Mr Beghi.

 3. The respondent considered that therefore the appellant was not entitled
    to the 75 points claimed under  Appendix  A  as  he  had  not  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules but she  did  not  carry  out  an
    assessment pursuant to paragraph 245DD(h) of the Immigration  Rules  as
    the application had been refused in any event.

 4. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, averring:-

      i) that  the  appellant  had  wrongly  failed  to  request  additional
         evidence pursuant to paragraph 245AA(e) of the Immigration Rules as
         required  by  paragraph  245AA(b),  that  did  not  apply  to   the
         application [15] and that the impugned documents could be rectified
         had further information been sought;

     ii) that the respondent had in any event failed to  apply  the  correct
         version of paragraph 245AA of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  took
         effect from 6 September 2012 [18];

    iii) that the respondent had failed to have regard to her own evidential
         flexibility policy [21] and had breached the  common  law  duty  of
         acting fairly [25];

     iv) that the respondent failed in her  assessment  of  the  appellant's
         rights pursuant to Article 8.

 5. The appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Powell  sitting  at
    Newport on 29 January 2014.  In his  determination  promulgated  on  30
    January 2014 Judge Powell found:-

      i) that it was  properly  conceded  that  the  evidential  flexibility
         policy should  have  led  the  respondent  to  request  information
         missing from the bank letter and that had the request been made  in
         accordance with the policy, missing  information  could  have  been
         supplied;

     ii) that although the third party declaration had been  altered,  there
         was no suggestion the documents were fraudulent and he accepted the
         document had been prepared in a rush hence the typographical errors
         which had subsequently been corrected  [17  to  21]  and  that  the
         document was reliable and thus valid;

    iii) that identification cards issued in Bangladesh do  not  contain  an
         expiry date and that the respondent was imposing a requirement that
         could not be met and thus in order to give effect to the purpose of
         this part of the Immigration Rules he read the words "where  expiry
         dates are given" into the Rule and  thus  was  satisfied  that  the
         application was sufficient.

 6. Judge Powell then allowed the appeal on the basis  that  the  appellant
    was entitled to the number of points sought under Appendix  A  and  the
    appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules.

 7. The respondent sought permission to appeal on the grounds that:-

      i) that there was no record in the Home Office file of the  concession
         referred to at  paragraph  15  and  in  any  event  the  evidential
         flexibility policy would not, in the  light  of  SSHD  v  Rodriguez
         [2014] EWCA Civ 2 have applied  and  that  in  any  event  had  the
         evidential flexibility policy applied all the judge could have done
         was to allow the appeal to the extent that it was  not  lawful  and
         remit the matter back to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  a  lawful
         decision to be made;

     ii) that in any event given the appellant had relied on a  bank  letter
         from Rupali Bank, he could not have met  the  requirements  of  the
         Regulations given that Appendix P of the Immigration Rules includes
         the Rupali Bank on the list of financial institutions in Bangladesh
         that do not satisfactorily verify financial statements;

    iii) that the  judge  should,  given  the  errors  in  the  third  party
         declaration, not have allowed  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of  the
         evidence which was presented.

 8. On 15 April 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade granted permission to
    appeal.

Did the Decision of the First-tier Tribunal Involve the Making of  an  Error
of Law?

 9. As both representatives  agreed,  it  is  difficult  to  discern  which
    version of the Immigration Rules is applicable to this case  given  the
    substantial number of changes in the rules which have occurred  between
    the application being lodged  and  it  being  determined.   There  were
    during this period, from 3 February 2012  to  July  2013  changes  with
    respect both to paragraph 245AA, of the Immigration Rules and paragraph
    41-SD of Appendix A.  In addition, as Mr Tufan  very  fairly  conceded,
    the reference to Appendix P in the grounds of appeal  is  not  relevant
    given that the inclusion of the  Rupali  Bank  within  Appendix  P  was
    introduced by the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules HC  760
    with effect from 13 December 2012 but  with  the  provision  that  with
    respect to applications made before 13 December 2012 would  be  decided
    in accordance with the Rules in force as at 12 December 2012.

10. The consideration of the Immigration Rules must start with paragraph 41-
    SD which sets out the requirements  for  the  relevant  documents.  The
    provisions of paragraph 41-SD  were  initially  introduced  by  Command
    paper 8423 on 10 July  2012  without  transitional  provisions.   These
    requirements were substantially amended by HC 628 with  effect  from  1
    October 2013 which deleted the existing paragraph 41-SD substituting it
    with a new version.   That  version  of  the  Rules  cannot  have  been
    applicable here as their introduction postdates the date of decision.

11. Absent any cogent submissions to the contrary, I am satisfied that  the
    version  of  paragraph  41-SD  which  was  in  force  at  the  date  of
    application and the date of decision was that set out in Command  paper
    8423 and I  am  not  satisfied  that  they  were  the  subject  of  any
    amendments relevant to this case  I am therefore satisfied so far as it
    is relevant the Immigration Rules provided as follows:-


    (a) The specified documents to show evidence of the money available to
    invest are one or
       more of the following specified documents:
       (i) A letter from each financial institution holding the funds, to
       confirm the amount of money available to the applicant (or the
       entrepreneurial team if applying under the provisions in paragraph
       52 of this Appendix). Each letter must:
          (1) be an original document and not a copy,
          (2) be on the institution's official headed paper,
          (3) have been issued by an authorised official of that
          institution,
          (4) have been produced within the three months immediately before
          the date of your application,
          (5) confirm that the institution is regulated by the appropriate
          body,
          (6) state the applicant's name, and his team partner's name if the
          applicant is applying under the provisions in paragraph 52 of this
          Appendix,
          (7) state the date of the document,
          (8) confirm the amount of money available from the applicant's own
          funds (if applicable) that are held in that institution,
          (9) confirm the amount of money provided to the applicant from any
          third party (if applicable) that is held in that institution,
          (10) confirm the name of each third party and their contact
          details, including their full address including postal code,
          landline phone number and any email address, and
          (11) confirm that if the money is not in an institution regulated
          by the FSA,


12. It is not disputed that the letter from the  Rupali  Bank  omitted  the
    third party (Mr Beghi's) email address and telephone number and thus it
    did not  comply  with  the  Immigration  Rules.   Thus,  even  had  any
    evidential flexibility policy been applicable, it was not open to Judge
    Powell to allow the appeal on the basis it was in accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules.

13. On that basis alone, the determination did involve  the  making  of  an
    error of law and requires to be set aside.

14. Whilst I note Mr Tufan's submissions with regards  to  the  second  and
    third grounds, I consider that Judge Powell has given  adequate  reason
    for concluding that despite the typographical errors in the third party
    declaration it was nonetheless a reliable document.   I  note  in  this
    respect that the respondent's case is  not  that  the  letter  did  not
    contain the relevant information simply that it could not be  discerned
    from it whether it was "original"  or  not.   That  is  I  consider  to
    misunderstand the nature of an original document; it is possible for  a
    document still to be original, that is not  a  copy,  if  it  has  been
    amended and initialled by the parties who executed it.  The  fact  that
    they amended it does not mean that the document is not an original;  it
    simply means that the original document  is  that  which  includes  the
    amendments.

15. Judge Powell's findings as to the letter from the legal  representative
    are not challenged by the  grounds  of  appeal  and  he  has  explained
    adequately  why  he  was  satisfied  that  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules were met with respect to this,  typographical  errors
    notwithstanding.

16. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the decision of Judge Powell did
    involve the making of an error of law in that  he  allowed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules, a decision which was not open to him. That
    error extends only to the letter from the Rupali Bank, and the omission
    from it of details of the third party's contact  details.  It  is  thus
    necessary to remake that  part  of  his  decision  which  concerns  the
    omissions contained within the letter from Rupali Bank.

Remaking the decision

17. Mr Khan submitted that the letter from  Rupali  Bank  fell  within  the
    terms of paragraph 245AA which were applicable at the time and  in  the
    alternative that they met  the  terms  of  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy then in place.

18. Mr Tufan submitted that the requirements of paragraph 245AA at the time
    were not met and that, in any event, following SSHD  v  Rodriguez,  the
    evidential flexibility policy was no assistance to the claimant.

19. As currently constituted paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration  Rules  it
    does appear to cover the situation  where,  as  here,  information  was
    omitted from a document.  The Rules currently provide as follows:-



      (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

        (i) Some of the documents in a sequence have been omitted (for
        example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);

        (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is
        not on letterhead paper as specified); or

        (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or


        (iv) A document does not contain all of the specified information;


20. The previous provisions provided as follows:-


       (b) The subparagraph applies if the applicant has submitted:
       (i) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in the
       sequence have been omitted (for example, if one bank statement from
       a series is missing);

       (ii) A document in the wrong format; or

       (iii) A document that is a copy and not an original document, the UK
       Border Agency will contact the applicant or his representative in
       writing, and request the correct documents. The requested documents
       must be received by the UK Border Agency at the address specified in
       the request within 7 working days of the date of the request.


21. The significant difference so far as it relates to this case is in  the
    introduction of paragraph 245AA(b)(iv).   That  provision  was  not  in
    force at the date  of  decision  or  application  and  thus  I  am  not
    satisfied that the appellant is assisted by it. I do not consider  that
    the omission of information from a document could fall within paragraph
    245 AA (b) as constituted at the date of decision.

22. As the  Court  of  Appeal  noted  in  Rodriguez,  [47]  the  evidential
    flexibility policy guidance which had underpinned the decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal had been incorporated into the Immigration Rules from  6
    September 2012 by amendment of paragraph 245AA.  It also  appears  that
    subsequent guidance has been given and  there  was  a  version  of  the
    evidential flexibility guidance  (version  5.0)  before  the  Court  of
    Appeal.  As it appears that  policies  have  continued  to  be  issued,
    albeit not in the same terms as the policy which was in place prior  to
    the introduction of paragraph 245 AA

23. The questions then arise with respect to this appeal

      1) Was there in place at the relevant time any evidential  flexibility
         instruction;

      2) If so, what were its contents; and,

      3) whether the policy could or should have been considered.

24. The refusal letter refers to  the  Rules  but  makes  no  reference  to
    paragraph 245AA or to guidance.  As I am satisfied that paragraph 245AA
    would not have benefitted the appellant, any failure by the  respondent
    to consider it is not material.

25. Mr Khan sought to rely on a policy entitled  "PBS  process  instruction
    evidential flexibility" produced by Mr Khan is undated.   It  gives  no
    version number and I cannot therefore tell whether it was in  place  at
    the  relevant  date  although  I  do  accept  that  as  it  refers   to
    applications under consideration as of 28 March 2011.  That  is  not  a
    sufficient basis for determining when the policy was put into force, or
    when or if it was superseded.







26. Accordingly, I cannot be satisfied that  this  undated  policy  was  in
    place at the relevant time and the claimant  had  therefore  failed  to
    satisfy me that the decision in this case was contrary  either  to  the
    Immigration Rules or to any relevant policy.  Accordingly, I find  that
    the decision was in accordance with the law and in accordance with  the
    Immigration Rules and I dismiss the appeal on those grounds.

27. Judge Powell did not address  whether  the  respondent's  decision  was
    unfair  in  the  "Thakur"  sense,  nor  did  he  consider  whether  the
    appellant's removal would be in breach of his article 8 rights.   There
    was no cross appeal in this case, nor did Mr Khan address me on  either
    issue.  I find that I am not satisfied on the material before  me  that
    the applicant's decision in this case which was in accordance with  the
    rules and policy involved any unfairness on the part of the respondent.
    Further, I am not satisfied that the claimant meets the requirements of
    paragraph 276 ADE or  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.     In
    addition, while I am satisfied that  the  claimant  has  established  a
    private life in this country, he has lived here for a short time. I  am
    not satisfied that he has established any good grounds why his  removal
    would,  despite  being  in  accordance  with  the  immigration   rules,
    nonetheless be disproportionate, nor did Mr Khan make such a submission
    to me.

28. I dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
