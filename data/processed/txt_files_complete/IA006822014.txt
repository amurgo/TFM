                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Unigwe, Counsel, instructed by Edward Marshall
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen  of  Ghana  said  to  have  entered  into  a
    relationship with one Glema Puzynuba, a Lithuanian national.  It is the
    contention of the appellant that on 16 November 2012, whilst both  were
    in the UK, the couple married under  the  Ghanaian  customary  marriage
    law.  On 7 May 2013 the appellant applied for a residence card  on  the
    basis of this marriage.

2.   A number of documents were supplied to the respondent  and  indeed  are
    relied upon in the course of the  appeal.   The  first  document  is  a
    statutory declaration dated 23  November  2012  made  before  a  notary
    public, Effiba Amiher.  The second  is  a  letter  from  second  deputy
    judicial secretary of the judicial service in Accra  attesting  to  the
    stamp and seal of  Effiba  Amihere,  which  appears  on  the  statutory
    declaration. The third document is from the Legal and Counsellor Bureau
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs And Regional Immigration dated 11  December
    2012 recognising the signature of the second deputy  judicial  sectary.
    The next document is indeed the full register of the customary marriage
    stating that that took place on 16 November 2012 at Accra.

3.   The final document being  a  confirmation  of  the  customary  marriage
    signed by the High Commissioner for Counsellor Affairs dated  13  March
    2013.

4.   In the reasons for refusal, the Secretary of State took  issue  with  a
    number of matters  arising  from  the  documentation  and  it  was  the
    understanding of the Secretary of State at the time of the refusal that
    it was not a valid customary marriage because the requirement  for  the
    same was that both parties to it were Ghanaian  citizens.  There  were,
    however, other matters raised of concern  in  terms  of  the  documents
    themselves.

5.   The appeal came for hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Gibbs  on
    9 June 2014.  The Judge heard from the appellant and indeed  from  Miss
    Puzynuea.  They first went out together in November 2008, the  proposal
    of marriage made in 2010.  They have cohabited since 2012.

6.   The first  issue  raised  was  that  highlighted  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal, namely that it was  not  a  customary  marriage  because  both
    parties were not  Ghanaian  citizens.   Reliance  was  placed  upon  NA
    (Customary marriage and divorce, evidence) Ghana  [2009]  UKAIT  00009.
    Seemingly, however, the expert who  prepared  a  report  in  that  case
    modified her opinion in a subsequent case of Amoako (IA/23315/2012), an
    unreported case.  Seemingly in the revised  opinion  only  one  of  the
    parties need to be a Ghanaian  citizen.   The  Judge  acted  upon  that
    unreported case and resolved that matter in favour of the appellants.

7.   The second substantial challenge was, however,  that  of  the  position
    set out in Kareem [2004]  UKUT  0024  (IAC).  That  case  purported  to
    indicate that it was fundamental to the issue of a residence card  that
    the marriage was recognised in the country of the EEA  citizen  namely,
    Lithuania.  There was no evidence on that matter. The  Judge,  however,
    did not find that Kareem said that in terms and did not find that  that
    was a requirement as set out in the case.

8.   The Judge considered  that  as  no  challenge  had  been  made  to  the
    marriage certificate regarding the issuing  authority  that  there  was
    indeed a valid marriage and accordingly allowed the appeal.

9.   The respondent raised a number of matters  challenging  that  decision.
    Permission was granted.  Thus it was that the matter  comes  before  me
    in pursuance of that grant.

10.  Having heard Mr Unigwe on behalf  of  the  claimant  and  Mr  Duffy  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, I have little
    doubt that this is a decision which must be set aside for error of law.



11.  It is clear, as I so  find  from  the  decision  of  Kareem  an  indeed
    reinforced by a decision of the  Tribunal  in  EA  and  Others  (Kareem
    explained) Ghana [2014] UKUT 00316 (IAC),  that  it  is  a  fundamental
    requirement that the marriage  be  recognised  by  the  EEA  national's
    state.  At the time of the hearing no such recognition was in  evidence
    and I find that the Judge was in error in failing to act upon Kareem.

12.  Mr Unigwe submits that the Judge's approach to Kareem, as  set  out  in
    that determination, was perfectly correct.  It was  not  a  very  clear
    decision and the Judge was therefore entitled  to  act  as  he  did  in
    respect of it.  I disagree that it was unclear but  in  any  event  the
    legal principle has now been clarified by the Tribunal  .Applying.  the
    long established principles of jurisprudence, I find that the Judge was
    incorrect in not applying that principle - a  principle  which  at  the
    very least has been clarified and is to be followed by  the  Judges  of
    the Upper Tribunal unless good reason for departing have been found.

13.  I  find  also  that  the  Judge's  approach  to  the  documentation  is
    fundamentally flawed. Contrary to the contention of the  Judge  ,it  is
    clear from the reasons for refusal that  a  substantive  challenge  has
    been made to those documents.

14.  What is surprising is the proposition, that  was  advanced  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and before me, to the  effect  that  the  statutory
    declaration was not required in order for the marriage to  be  a  valid
    one. That has some significance given the challenges which are made  by
    the Secretary  of  State  in  the  reasons  for  refusal  towards  that
    statutory declaration.  Mr Unigwe submits that  because  the  statutory
    declaration was not required as a matter of law it is  immaterial  that
    there be criticisms of it.

15.  That seems to me to be a rather naï¿½ve proposition  to  take.   If  that
    statutory declaration was not required it calls into question as to why
    it was submitted, not only by itself but in company with  a  number  of
    other  documents  attesting  to  the  witnesses   to   that   statutory
    declaration and beyond. If all that was required was  the  registration
    of their marriage, then it was surprising that so many other  documents
    were enclosed, particularly if they were not  strictly  required.   One
    possible interpretation that could reasonably flow from that  was  that
    they were there to create  the  appearance  of  legality  to  what  was
    otherwise a questionable marriage.

16.  It is clearly a  requirement  for  a  customary  marriage  that  it  be
    conducted in accordance with the customary procedures but  there  would
    seem to be little evidence as to what procedures were in fact conducted
    at the  time.   It  is  not  clear,  particularly  from  the  statutory
    declaration, as to who was present.

17.  The two declarants to the statutory declaration are  a  Paul  Badoonati
    and Osei Owusu. They claim to be the father and representative  of  the
    appellant and of the sponsor and her family.   Thereafter  follows  the
    form of register of customary  marriage  which  purportedly  bears  the
    signature of the appellant and of his spouse. It is not entirely  clear
    how they came to be affixed to the document if they were in the  United
    Kingdom.  The witnesses to the document are John  Mensah  and  a  Joyce
    (surname indecipherable).  It is not clear how that  document  came  to
    arise.

18.  I do not find that the Judge was correct in saying  that  no  challenge
    had been  made  to  the  marriage  certificate,  it  is  clear  that  a
    substantial challenge was made to the documentation as a whole.

19.  Mr Unigwe seeks to persuade me that  even  were  Kareem  to  have  been
    followed that error is no longer a material one in  the  light  of  new
    evidence that is presented before the Tribunal, namely  an  endorsement
    from the Embassy of Lithuania in the United  Kingdom  dated  29  August
    2014 confirming that the appellant's marriage certificate is recognised
    by the Lithuanian authorities.   It  is  stated  that  the  appellant's
    marriage certificate is endorsed by the Embassy of Lithuania in the UK.



20.  However the document that is enclosed purporting  to  be  the  same  is
    nothing of the kind.  No  official  stamp  has  been  placed  upon  the
    marriage certificate at all, rather  upon  the  statement  from  Samuel
    Boakye-Yiadom, the second deputy judicial  secretary,  certifying  that
    the signature of Effida Amihere on the statutory declaration is what it
    purports to be.

21.  Mr  Unigwe  submitted  that  the  marriage  certificate  could  not  be
    obtained because the original was with the Home Office.  For my part  I
    can see no difficulty why a duplicate  could  not  have  been  obtained
    and/or a certified copy of the same.   Given  the   contention  that  a
    statutory declaration was not strictly required for the purposes of the
    marriage, it makes very little sense for that document or one linked to
    it to have been  stamped.  It is said that  the  statutory  declaration
    was also bound up with the statement from the  second  deputy  judicial
    secretary but if  that  were  the  case  it  is  surprising  that  both
    documents were not so stamped.  I place very little  weight  upon  that
    document as evidencing any agreement by the Lithuanian government  that
    the marriage was to be recognised by them as valid.

22.  I indicated that,  given the  errors  of  law,  the  matter  should  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal as the primary finders of fact.   I
    bear in mind paragraph 7 of the Senior President's Practice  Direction.
    Mr Unigwe invited me to retain  all  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge except for that in relation to Kareem.


23.  I declined to do so.  It seems to me  that  the  interests  of  justice
    require this there be a de  novo hearing on all issues  so  that  clear
    findings can be made.

24.  As I  have  indicated,  I  do  not  agree  with  the  proposition  that
    irrelevant  documents  need  not  be  carefully   explained.    It   is
    fundamental to  the  process  as  set  out  in  Kareem  that  there  be
    consideration of the documentation that is presented and the   concerns
    that have been expressed in the reasons for refusal clearly do need  to
    be addressed.

24.  I would expect there to be some evidence  from  those  present  at  the
    marriage celebration setting out what  is  the  cultural  or  customary
    course that is taken.  It is far from clear as to whether or not either
    parent or the sponsor was present and, if not, on what basis Mr  Ocosei
    Owusu was appointed.  Given that  there  was  no  requirement  for  the
    statutory declaration there will need to be some explanation as to  why
    therefore so many unnecessary documents were submitted.   The  concerns
    of the Secretary of State in the refusal letter fall to be addressed.

25.   It  seems  to  me  also  that  clear  evidence  from  the   Lithuanian
    authorities is perfectly possible and reasonably to be expected, namely
    that having  regard  to  the  marriage  certificate  that  marriage  is
    recognised by Lithuania as being legal in all respects.

26.  Apart from noting the date of the hearing to be at Hatton Cross  on  11
    March 2015 no other directions are given.  It will be open to the First-
    tier Tribunal to give such directions and the progress of  this  matter
    as may be appropriate.
