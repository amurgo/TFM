For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


1.    British citizenship is a  relevant  factor  when  assessing  the  best
interests of the child.

2.    British citizenship includes the opportunities for  children  to  live
in the UK, receive free  education,  have  full  access  to  healthcare  and
welfare provision and participate in the life of their  local  community  as
they grow up.

3.    There is no equivalent to s.117B(6) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
and Asylum Act 2002 in any provision of law  or  policy  relating  to  entry
clearance applicants.

4.    In assessing whether refusal to grant  a  parent  entry  clearance  to
join a partner has   unjustifiably harsh consequences, the fact that such  a
parent has a child living with him or her who has British citizenship  is  a
relevant factor. However, the weight to be accorded to such  a  factor  will
depend heavily on the particular circumstances  and  is  not  necessarily  a
powerful factor.

5.    When assessing the significance to be attached  to  a  parent's  child
having British citizenship, it will also be  relevant  to  consider  whether
that child possesses dual nationality and what rights  and  benefits  attach
to that other nationality.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is a decision to whose writing each member of the panel has
contributed.

2. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka. In November 2011 she married  a
British citizen, LD (the sponsor). She is a qualified nurse.  They have  two
children, born in  January  2013  and  April  2015  respectively.  Both  are
British citizens. In June 2016 she applied for entry clearance as  a  spouse
under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. This was refused on  17  January
2017. She applied again on 12  June  2017.  She  was  refused  again  on  10
September 2017. A review was refused by an Entry  Clearance  Manager  on  15
June 2018. The appellant's appeal was dismissed by Judge Burns of the First-
tier Tribunal on 4 September 2018. On 30 July 2019 the  Upper  Tribunal  set
aside Judge Burn's decision for material  error  of  law,  finding  that  in
assessing the appellant's Article 8 circumstances the judge  had  failed  to
have regard to the (British) nationality of the two children. In this  case,
the two British citizen children reside with the appellant  abroad,  in  Sri
Lanka and so the issue of the significance or  otherwise  of  their  British
citizenship arises in the context of the refusal of the application made  by
their mother to join her husband and the children's father in the UK.

3. The basis of the respondent's refusal of entry clearance on 10  September
2017 (which is the subject of this appeal) was that she  did  not  meet  the
eligibility financial requirements under para E-ECP.3.1. to 3.4 of  Appendix
FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  "[N]umerous  discrepancies"  between   the
sponsor's payslips and the transactions in his bank statement  and  also  in
pay dates, led the  respondent  to  conclude  that  his  gross  income  from
employment had not been  shown  to  meet  the  financial  requirements.  His
application was therefore refused under paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of  Appendix
FM.  The  respondent   also   stated,   under   the   heading   "Exceptional
circumstances", that "based on the information you  have  provided  we  have
decided that there are no such  exceptional  circumstances  in  your  case."
Under a further heading, "Refusal under the Partner Rules",  the  respondent
noted that as well as not qualifying under the  5-year  partner  route,  the
appellant did not qualify "on the 10-year partner  route  on  the  basis  of
exceptional circumstances under Appendix FM."

4. The appellant's skeleton argument accepted that  the  appellant  did  not
meet the provisions of Appendix FM, but maintained  that  in  assessing  the
proportionality of the ECO refusal, that was not a determinative factor.  It
was  submitted  that  the  refusal  decision   effectively   prevented   the
appellant's two British citizen children from living  in  the  UK  and  thus
engaged Article 8 in and of itself, even if the children had never lived  in
the UK. Nationality or citizenship was an important  aspect  of  a  person's
social identity and can form  a  component  of  private  life  protected  by
Article 8(1). Whilst the children in this case were not  deprived  of  their
British citizenship, the decision robbed them, in practical  terms,  of  the
opportunity to exercise their rights as British citizens. If they could  not
come to the UK they could not exercise their right  of  abode  and  all  its
concomitant rights - "the right to grow up in their country with  their  own
culture and language; their right to  attend  UK  schools  and  receive  NHS
treatment; or their right to develop and maintain  social  relationships  in
the UK."

5.  The skeleton argument stated that "[i]t is no answer to say  they  could
come to the UK at a later date." It was argued that  although  the  domestic
law duty under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
2009 does not apply to them, it is clear from  Jeunesse  v  The  Netherlands
(2015) 60 EHRR 789, among other cases, that the Strasbourg jurisprudence  on
Article 8 applies the best interests of the child  test  and  in  this  case
their best interests weighed strongly  in  favour  of  them  being  able  to
reside in the UK and exercise their rights as British citizens  to  grow  up
in the UK where they will  enjoy  a  higher  standard  of  health  care  and
education to which they are entitled as of right. Accordingly, their  status
as British citizens  should  be  treated  as  a  "powerful  factor"  in  the
assessment of proportionality outside the Rules  and  accorded  "substantial
weight".

6. The appellant's skeleton argument  also  submitted  that  whilst  British
citizen children outside the  UK  are  not  in  all  respects  in  the  same
position as that of British citizen children in the UK,  whose  parents  had
the benefit of section 117B(6) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
Act 2002 (hereafter the 2002 Act), this provision was still pertinent  since
it  reflected  a  policy  of  Parliament  that,  save  in  cases   involving
criminality or poor immigration history,  British  citizen  children  should
not be forced to choose between living in  the  UK  and  living  with  their
parent(s). Further, it was submitted that it would  be  unjust  to  put  the
appellant in a worse position because she applied for entry  clearance  from
abroad, rather than (for example)  entering  illegally  or  overstaying  and
then making an in-country application under s.117B(6).

7. It was also contended that even though the  sponsor  had  ceased  working
since the last hearing, the appellant had been offered a job as carer  at  a
nursing home in the UK working 40  hours  a  week,  which  would  create  an
adequate income to maintain and accommodate herself and  the  children.  Her
potential earnings were a factor that could properly be taken  into  account
when assessing Article 8 outside the Rules (in support,  the  grounds  cited
the case of MM v Secretary of State [2014] EWCA Civ 985, but  we  note  that
the same point was advanced in MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10) at  [99]-[100]).


8. The respondent's skeleton argument contended that the appellant  did  not
meet the Immigration Rules at the time she applied, and she could  not  meet
the Rules now. There was no reason why she could not reapply once the  Rules
can be met.

9. It was submitted further that in order to qualify for a  grant  of  entry
clearance outside the Rules the appellant must demonstrate the existence  of
exceptional circumstances that would make it unjustifiably harsh  to  refuse
her  entry  to  the  UK.  The  refusal  decision  did  not  give   rise   to
"interference of such severity as to engage Article  8."  Alternatively,  it
was submitted that any  interference  was  limited  and  proportionate.  The
respondent accepted that the best interests of the child  were  "capable  in
principle  of  forming  a  factor  relevant  to  proportionality".  In   the
appellant's case, the question regarding the best  interests  of  the  child
yielded an "unemphatic" answer since the children had wider  family  in  Sri
Lanka and their continuous residence in Sri  Lanka  would  be  disrupted  by
relocation. Further, the ECO  refusal  would  only  delay,  not  permanently
deprive, the opportunity for the children to exercise their right to  reside
in the UK. Nor had it been shown that the children could not,  for  example,
attend school in the UK during term time,  continuing  to  live  with  their
mother in Sri Lanka the rest of the year.

10. The fact that there was no reason why the appellant  could  not  reapply
when she could meet the Rules was also relevant  to  proportionality,  since
the appellant and sponsor will have been aware at all  material  times  that
they may not be able to live together in the UK, unless and until they  meet
Immigration Rule requirements. The ECO refusal  only  maintains  the  status
quo ante and Article 8 does not protect a preference  for  domicile  and  it
has not been established that the family  could  not  reasonably  choose  to
live together in Sri Lanka.  Also  weighing  against  the  appellant's  case
based on family life was  that  she  had  stated  in  her  application  that
"[d]uring my stay in the  UK  our  children  will  be  looked  after  by  my
parents." There was no reason to consider that it  is  any  less  reasonable
now for the children to remain in Sri Lanka with  their  mother  pending  an
application that meets the Rules, than it would have been  at  the  date  of
application for the children to remain in Sri Lanka  without  their  mother.
It  was  argued  that  the  expressed  willingness  of  the   appellant   to
voluntarily leave the children in Sri  Lanka  for  an  indeterminate  period
significantly undermined  her  arguments  that  the  appealed  decision  was
incompatible with s.55 and Article 8.

11. It was also submitted, as regards the  appellant's  private  life,  that
the appealed decision does not interfere with the appellant's private  life;
private life is not engaged in respect of a person outside  the  Contracting
State: Secretary of State for the Home Department v Abbas  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
1393 at [18]. The children, it was submitted, are not prevented from  living
in the UK by the appealed decision or at all.

Submissions at the hearing

12. Mr Lewis asked us to find that the decision under challenge was both  an
interference  with  family  and  private   life   and   a   disproportionate
interference. Central to the appellant's case  was  the  fact  that  British
citizenship was not simply an economic right; its right of  abode  component
amounted to, in the words of Lord Mance in R (Bancoult) v Foreign  Secretary
(No 2) [2009] 1 AC 453 at [151], a constitutional or  foundational  right.
Nationality, Mr Lewis  said,  gives  choice  and  the  ability  to  exercise
choice. Its core was the right of abode and the  longer  the  children  were
away from the UK the harder it  would  be  for  them  to  integrate  and  to
contribute and add to the social fabric.

13. As regards the private life component  to  the  appellant's  claim,  her
case was to be distinguished from that considered by the Court of Appeal  in
Abbas, since in Abbas  there  was  no  British  national  children  and  the
application was for a visit visa whereas here  the  appellant  sought  entry
with a view to settlement. The respondent was required to undertake  a  best
interests of the child assessment and, in the appellant's case,  refusal  of
entry clearance to her entailed denial to her British  citizen  children  of
the opportunity to exercise the rights and  benefits  of  that  nationality.
The children had made known  their  wish  to  come  to  the  UK.  They  were
entitled as British citizen children to the higher  standards  of  education
and social welfare available  in  the  UK.  He  reiterated  the  appellant's
submission that the British citizenship of the children did  not  create  an
absolute entitlement for the appellant to be granted entry clearance but  it
provided powerful reasons which could only be outweighed by  criminality  or
a poor immigration history, neither of which pertained here. Ironically,  if
the appellant had entered illegally she  may  have  stood  to  benefit  from
117B(6). Both parents were of good character.

14. Mr Lewis pointed out that, as regards the  appellant's  situation  under
the Immigration Rules, the sponsor was no  longer  in  work  due  to  health
problems, including anxiety and depression, but the appellant, although  not
working in Sri Lanka presently, had an offer of employment as a nurse  carer
which meant the couple could now meet the financial requirements. The  Upper
Tribunal was in as good a position as  the  ECO  to  reach  a  view  on  the
current financial circumstances.  They had already paid the  fee  for  their
application. The sponsor  had  lived  for  periods  in  Sri  Lanka  and  had
attempted to find work, the longest being for 2 months on a salary of  �450-
500 per month. The costs of the children attending  an  English  school  was
�200 a month. On that salary he would not be able to pay  to  continue  that
schooling.  The state school was Tamil-speaking. The children had  been  put
into an English school to prepare them for life in  the  UK.  Their  parents
identified education in the UK as being  of  primary  importance  for  their
children.

15. Mr Lewis reiterated the point that even though s117B(6) of the 2002  Act
was not applicable to the appellant, it clearly reflected  a  public  policy
to accord particular weight to the nationality of children who were  British
citizens.

16. Mr Lewis submitted that there were  exceptional  circumstances  in  this
case: the father and the two children were British citizens; the father  was
suffering from mental health issues; one of the children had gone to the  UK
to visit the father but he could not cope on his own.  This  underlined  the
importance of the best interests of the children lying in  being  with  both
their parents.  It was unrealistic due to economic circumstances to  suggest
the children could move between the UK and Sri Lanka.

17.  Mr Lindsay submitted that it was incorrect to portray  the  refusal  of
entry clearance to the appellant as denying  the  children  their  right  of
abode or opportunity to live with their mother and family as a family  unit.
 As regards the financial circumstances of the appellant and  sponsor,  they
had clearly failed to meet the financial requirements. Even  accepting  that
for the purposes  of  assessing  the  appellant's  Article  8  circumstances
outside the Rules it  was  proper  to  consider  the  appellant's  potential
earnings from a job as a nurse in the UK, there were evidential gaps  -  for
example the job offer to the appellant had not been verified, there  was  no
medical evidence that the sponsor could not work and  there  were  childcare
issues if she worked. The Home Office guidance on exceptional  circumstances
made clear that it was only if there  were  exceptional  circumstances  that
consideration might be given to disregarding the financial requirements.

18. In relation to the children's best interests, Mr Lindsay  accepted  that
s.55 considerations were capable of being applied,  but  submitted  that  it
was not uncommon for children to come to the UK when  they  were  older  and
there was no reason why they could not make visits or indeed  attend  school
in the UK, whilst remaining based in Sri Lanka.  In  the  appellant's  case,
the best interests of the child assessment cut both ways and  it  could  not
simply be assumed that their integration into Sri Lankan  society  was  less
important than their potential integration into UK society.  It was easy  to
imagine a situation of a British citizen child in which there might be  very
exceptional circumstances justifying entry  clearance  being  granted  to  a
parent of a British citizen child, if for example a child  needed  an  organ
transplant in the UK and  the  parent  was  needed  to  be  with  the  child
throughout that process, but that was not this case.

19. Mr Lindsay asked us  to  reject  the  appellant's  contention  that  the
appellant's right to respect for private life was engaged. The  decision  of
Abbas was clear that in entry clearance cases there was no obligation  on  a
contracting state to protect private life.  There was  no  Strasbourg  Court
authority to support the view that there was.

20.  So far as concerned the appellant's family life claim, it had not  been
shown that the sponsor could not go and  live  in  Sri  Lanka  or  that  the
children could not exercise their rights as British  citizens  by  attending
school in the UK and returning to Sri Lanka on holidays. The appellant  said
in her application that it was planned to leave the children  in  Sri  Lanka
whilst she came to the UK to find work; it had not been shown there was  any
material change since  then.  Further,  there  was  a  proportionate  option
available to the family, namely, to resubmit a fresh application  when  they
could meet the requirements of the Rules.






OUR ASSESSMENT

General

21. Before setting out the legal framework and addressing  the  main  points
raised in submissions, it may assist to furnish some context,  by  noting  a
number of basic  propositions,  first  about  the  nationality  of  children
considered  from  the  international  law  perspective,  and  second   about
possession of British  citizenship,  in  particular  by  children.  For  the
avoidance of doubt, we are concerned throughout this decision  with  British
nationality in the form of British citizenship  only,  not  with  any  other
type of British nationality.[1]

Nationality and children

Nationality

22. In SSHD v Al-Jedda [2013] UKSC 62 at  [12],  Lord  Wilson  endorsed  the
well-known aphorism of Warren CJ in Perez v Brownell, 356 US 44,  64  (1958)
that the right to nationality was "nothing  less  than  the  right  to  have
rights".  In  international  law,  nationality  is  defined  as  the   legal
relationship or 'legal bond' between the national and his or her  state.  It
is 'the juridical expression of the fact that an individual upon whom it  is
conferred...is in fact more closely connected with  the  population  of  the
State conferring nationality than with that of any other State'.  (Nottebohm
Case (Liechtenstein v Guatemala): Second  Phase,  ICJ,  6  April  1955,  ICJ
Reports, p.4,23; General List, No.18). It gives rise to  rights  and  duties
on the part of both sides of this relationship.

23. As regards the substantive contents of these rights  and  duties,  there
is no definitive statement, although there is broad agreement (we draw  here
on the summary given by  Alice  Edwards  in  Nationality  and  Statelessness
under International Law, C.U.P 2014 (eds Alice Edwards and Laura van  Waas))
that from the perspective of the national, possessing the nationality  of  a
particular state is generally associated with being granted entitlements  to
a range of rights, in particular, rights to (re-) admission and to  take  up
residence,   consular  assistance  when  abroad,  to  run   for   elections,
participate in public life and to vote, and the right  to  economic,  social
and cultural advancement.  Correspondingly,  from  the  perspective  of  the
state, it is generally seen to owe  certain  duties  to  its  nationals,  in
particular the right of diplomatic protection and the duty of  (re)admission
and residence. Nationals may be required to perform specific  civic  duties,
including the obligation to  defend  the  state  against  enemies  (military
service) and to pay taxes.

24. The absence of any agreed  content  to  substantive  rights  and  duties
attaching to nationality undoubtedly reflects the  strong  recognition  that
it is largely for states to determine the precise  contents  of  the  rights
and  benefits  they  afford  to  their  nationals.  The  UNHCR  Handbook  on
Protection of Stateless Persons under the 1954 Convention  relating  to  the
Status of Stateless Persons (Geneva, 2014), which was  referred  to  by  the
Supreme Court in Pham (Appellant) v SSHD  (Respondent)  [2015]  UKSC  19  at
[24], notes at paragraph 53:
      "Where States grant a legal status to certain groups  of  people  over
      whom they consider to have jurisdiction on the basis of a  nationality
      link rather than a form of residence, then a person belonging to  this
      category will be a "national" for the purposes of the 1954 Convention.
      Generally, at a minimum, such status will be associated with the right
      of entry, re-entry and residence in the State's  territory  but  there
      may be  situations  where,  for  historical  reasons,  entry  is  only
      permitted to a non-metropolitan territory belonging to  a  State.  The
      fact that different categories of  nationality  within  a  State  have
      different rights associated with them does not prevent  their  holders
      from being treated as a "national" for the purposes of  Article  1(1).
      Nor does the fact that in some countries the  rights  associated  with
      nationality are fewer than those enjoyed by nationals of other  States
      or indeed fall short of those required in terms of international human
      rights obligations. Although the issue of diminished rights may  raise
      issues regarding the effectiveness of the nationality  and  violations
      of international human rights obligations, this is  not  pertinent  to
      the application  of  the  stateless  person  definition  in  the  1954
      Convention."
25. The footnote to this passage observes that: "[h]istorically, there  does
not appear  to  have  been  any  requirement  under  international  law  for
nationality to have a specific content in terms of  rights  of  individuals,
as opposed to it creating certain inter-State obligations."
26.  Consonant  with  this  learning,  we  know  from  case   law   on   the
'nationality'  element of the  definition of 'refugee' in Article  1A(2)  of
the 1951 Refugee Convention that just because a state  denies  basic  rights
and benefits to its nationals - and for example  fails  in  the  process  to
protect them against persecution - does  not  mean  they  cease  to  be  its
nationals; that underlines how contingent are the actual  contents  of  such
rights and duties on what is the situation in the particular  state  at  the
relevant time.

27. To summarise the general position in international law, the rights  that
nationals possess are not rights to a particular  quality  of  enjoyment  of
those rights.  As  noted  by  Edwards  (ibid),  "[e]ven  though  the  above-
mentioned substantive rights are usually  associated  with  the  holding  of
nationality, the lack of access to or enjoyment of  these  rights  does  not
change the nationality status of the  individual  under  international  law,
nor ordinarily under municipal law." Edwards notes further that:

    "The only possible exception may be the case where a  state  denies  an
    individual of the  right  to  re-enter  and  reside  in  its  territory
    (considered as the  essence  of  nationality  as  a  matter  of  public
    international law), which could be interpreted as a  state  effectively
    denying that the individual is its national. However, this  could  only
    be determined on the individual case at hand and  considering  all  the
    relevant facts."



Nationality and children


28. At the same time it is also clear that, by  virtue  of  their  minority,
children are not in a position to exercise some of the rights  and  benefits
ordinarily associated with nationality for so long  as  they  are  children.
This  is  a  feature  highlighted  by  a  leading  expert  on  children  and
nationality, Jacqueline Bhaba[2], in  her  article  on  "The  importance  of
nationality for children", Institute on Statelessness and Exclusion, 2017:




      "Many of these rights and obligations are not applicable to  nationals
      under 18 years of age: children cannot vote,  they  cannot  stand  for
      public office, they cannot serve  on  juries,  and,  as  a  matter  of
      international law, they cannot be compelled to participate  in  active
      combat."

29. However, she goes on to emphasise that "these exclusions do  not  negate
the importance of nationality for children." She then  notes  the  following
examples:

      "First, even a very young child, like an adult,  will  need  proof  of
      nationality to qualify for safe and  legal  border  crossing.  Second,
      more age specifically, though primary education is supposed to be free
      and universally available to all children irrespective of nationality,
      comparable international mandates  do  not  apply  to  other,  equally
      critical, educational  opportunities,  a  deficit  with  consequential
      implications. Compared to their non-national peers, children who  are
      citizens  generally  have  privileged  access   to   early   childhood
      development and preschool opportunities, as well as  to  post  primary
      education, college scholarships and other educational facilities.  The
      same enhanced access for citizen children also applies to health care,
      to social welfare protections  and  to  other  critical  economic  and
      social rights facilities."
British citizenship and British citizen children
30. The rights and benefits of British citizenship are in  large  measure  a
matter of statute. Whether or not a constitutional right (a point  on  which
Lord Hoffman (at [43]) and Lord Mance [at [151] differed in R  (Bancoult)  v
Foreign Secretary (No 2)), the right of abode is clearly  one  of  the  most
important components of British citizenship. However, as Lord Hope  observed
in ZH (Tanzania) at [41], "there is much more to  British  citizenship  than
the status it gives to the children in  immigration  law  ...  [i]t  carries
with it a host of other benefits and advantages ... [which] ought  never  to
be left out of account." In the same case,  Lady  Hale  emphasised  at  [32]
that "the fact of belonging to a country fundamentally  affects  the  manner
of exercise of a child's family and private life, during childhood and  well
beyond."
31. In R (on the application of Johnson)  (Appellant)  v  SSHD  (Respondent)
[2016] UKSC 56, Lady Hale observed at [2] that "[t]here  are  many  benefits
to being a British citizen, among them the right to vote, the right to  live
and to work here without needing permission to do so,  and  everything  that
comes along with those rights". In Rights and  Responsibilities:  developing
our constitutional framework, a  publication  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice
dated March 2009, it is stated that:
      "Living in the UK, we enjoy a range of entitlements  which  go  beyond
      the civil and political rights in the European Convention and sit - as
      part of our well-established welfare state - firmly in the  sphere  of
      social and economic rights. Including provisions which  point  to  key
      aspects of our welfare state, such as the National Health Service  and
      our rights and responsibilities as patients and staff, could  help  to
      paint a fuller picture of the rights and responsibilities we share  as
      members of UK society."
32. Insofar as the position of British citizen children  is  concerned,  the
Home Office publication of July 2019, MN1 Registration as a British  citizen
- A guide about the registration of children under 18, states at  p.5  that:

      "Becoming a British citizen is a significant life  event.  Apart  from
      allowing a child to apply for  a  British  citizen  passport,  British
      citizenship gives them the opportunity to participate  more  fully  in
      the life of their local community as they grow up."
33. Whilst UK law also accords a number of rights and  benefits  to  persons
who are not British citizens (e.g. those who have settled status), they  are
fewer than those enjoyed by British citizens, As  noted  by  Jay  J  in  The
Project for the Registration of Children As British Citizens &  Ors,  R  (On
the Application Of) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2019]
EWHC 3536 (Admin) at [16]:
      "The  advantages  of  British  citizenship  cannot  be  considered  in
      abstract. The position of British citizens falls to be contrasted with
      those who have limited or indefinite leave to remain (there  are  also
      important practical differences between these species of leave),  into
      which categories the majority but not all of the children entitled  to
      be registered will no doubt fall. A person with  leave  to  remain  as
      opposed to the right of abode cannot enter and/or  remain  in  the  UK
      without let or hindrance: by definition, she requires leave, and  this
      permission may require examination by immigration officers at  a  port
      of entry or at Lunar House. The status may lapse; it may be cancelled;
      and individuals holding such  leave  are  liable  to  be  deported  on
      conducive grounds under s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971."
British citizenship and Union citizenship

34. Although, at time of writing, we are aware  that  matters  look  set  to
change, presently one of the features of  British  citizenship  is  that  it
creates the additional status of citizenship of  the  European  Union  under
article 9 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU)  and  further  provision
is made by article 20 of the Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European
Union (TFEU):

      "1. Citizenship of the  Union  is  hereby  established.  Every  person
      holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a  citizen  of  the
      Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace
      national citizenship."

35. By article 20(2), citizens of the Union "shall enjoy the rights  and  be
subject to the duties provided for in the Treaties." The rights  identified,
non-exhaustively, include "(a) the right to move and  reside  freely  within
the territory of the  Member  States."  This  includes  the  right  to  move
freely around Europe to live, work, study and retire. Citizens of the Union
can also vote and stand as a candidate in European Parliament and municipal
elections, petition the European Parliament and  complain to  the  European
Ombudsman. If a citizen of the Union is  travelling outside the EU and  his
or her country has no diplomatic  representation  there,  they  can   go  to
the embassy or consulate of any other EU country and receive assistance and
protection. In Case C-165/16, Lounes,  14  Nov  2017,  the  CJEU  stated  at
paragraph  56  that:  "the  rights  conferred  on   a   Union   citizen   by
Article 21(1) TFEU, including the derived  rights  enjoyed  by  his  family
members,  are  intended,  amongst  other  things,  to  promote  the  gradual
integration of the Union citizen  concerned  in  the  society  of  the  host
Member State."

36.  The  EU  dimension  brings  into  train,  of   course,   the   Zambrano
jurisprudence. As was stated by the CJEU in Ruiz Zambrano v Office  national
de l'emploi (Case C-34/09) [2012] QB 265 at paragraph 45:

      "45.       Accordingly, the answer to the questions referred  is  that
      article 20 TFEU ... is to be interpreted as meaning that it  precludes
      a member state from refusing a third  country  national  on  whom  his
      minor children, who are European  Union  citizens,  are  dependent,  a
      right of residence in the member state of residence and nationality of
      those children, and from refusing to grant a work permit to that third
      country national, in so far as such decisions deprive  those  children
      of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights  attaching  to
      the status of European Union citizen."

Dual or multiple nationality

37. So far our brief summary relates to nationality and British  citizenship
considered in the singular. However, the position becomes  more  complicated
if the person concerned has more than one nationality, as it is accepted  do
the appellant's two children in  this  case.  Again,  in  broad  terms  (and
focusing for the moment on adults), leading studies identify that there  are
advantages and disadvantages of dual or multiple nationality.

38. Dual citizens can receive the benefits and privileges  offered  by  each
country. For example, in theory they  have  access  to  two  social  service
systems, can vote in either country and may be able to  run  for  office  in
either country, depending on the law. They are also  in  theory  allowed  to
work in either country without needing a work permit or visa and can  attend
school in either country on the same  footing  as  other  citizen  children.
They are allowed to carry passports from both countries and enjoy the  right
of entry to both countries. They will ordinarily have  the  ability  to  own
property in either country. Dual or multiple  nationality  also  offers  the
possibility of integration into the culture of two  or  more  countries  and
the benefit of dual heritage.

39.  But  there  can  also  be  disadvantages  of having  more  than   one
nationality.  As a dual citizen, a person is  bound  by  the  laws  of  both
countries. Dual  citizens  may  be  legally  obligated  to  fulfil  military
obligations in one  or  both  of  the  countries  of  nationality.  In  some
countries there are employment security clearance hurdles  for  persons  who
have another nationality. There is also the potential for  double  taxation.
Further, there is the potential difficulty for persons seeking  to  rely  on
the opportunity to exercise their rights and benefits as a national  of  one
country, that they have available a separate  set  of  rights  and  benefits
flowing from their other nationality. This last feature is one we will  have
to consider further in the context of this appeal.


40. Again, however, not  all  of  the  above  rights  and  obligations  have
application to children.

41.  Whilst  our  general  overview  of  basic  principles   pertaining   to
nationality helps provide  context,  it  also  underscores  the  hazards  of
seeking to enunciate any general propositions about the  advantages  of  any
particular nationality for a person. As we have  seen,  the  actual  content
and quality of the rights and benefits attaching to nationality will  depend
heavily on particular circumstances. As Mr Lindsay observed, it is  possible
to construct hypothetical  examples  in  which  an  applicant  basing  their
application for entry clearance on having a British citizen child  might  be
decisive. He suggested the example of the parent of a British citizen  child
living abroad needing an urgent transplant available  only  in  the  UK  and
where it was imperative for the safety and welfare of  the  child  that  the
applicant parent accompany the child to the UK.  Another  possible  scenario
would be if an applicant whose child only has British nationality is in  the
position of being unable  to  access  education  for  that  child  in  their
country of origin. At least if there are other obstacles facing the  child's
upbringing in that country, the  arguments  in  favour  of  a  finding  that
denial of entry clearance to  the  parent  would  have  unjustifiably  harsh
consequences. might be compelling.

42. But equally it is possible  to  construct  hypotheses  where  the  child
involved may in fact suffer no  adverse  consequences  whatsoever  in  their
country of origin, if for example it has a  first-class  health  system  and
educational system, both fully accessible to the  child  and  the  child  is
perfectly integrated and happy there - and  indeed  there  may  be  positive
advantages to being brought up in their country of origin. In  the  absence,
therefore, of any policy on the part of the respondent to treat  it  so,  we
consider it would go too far to say that at the general  level  "substantial
weight" should be attached to the child involved having British  citizenship
or that there are "powerful reasons" for granting entry clearance.  It  will
be no satisfaction to Mr Lewis, but our answer to his  question  about  this
can only be, we think, "[i]t all depends on the  particular  circumstances".
We shall return to this theme when analysing Article 8 jurisprudence.

Specific legal framework

43. It is  not  in  dispute  that  the  appellant's  application  for  entry
clearance as a partner fell to be determined  under  the  Immigration  Rules
set out in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE. Since there  was,  however,  some
dispute over  whether  the  refusal  of  the  application  would  result  in
unjustifiably harsh consequences, necessitating an examination of Article  8
factors, outside the rules, it is salient  to  set  out  in  full  GEN.3.1.-
GEN.3.3 of the Rules, which  were  amended  from  10  August  2017  for  all
decisions made on or after that date by HC290:
    "Exceptional circumstances
    GEN.3.1.(1) Where:
    (a) the financial requirement in paragraph E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1.  (in
    the context of  an  application  for  limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
    partner), E-ECC.2.1. or E-LTRC.2.1. applies, and is not  met  from  the
    specified sources referred to in the relevant paragraph; and
    (b) it is evident from the information provided by the  applicant  that
    there are exceptional circumstances which could render refusal of entry
    clearance or leave to remain a breach of  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human  Rights,  because  such  refusal  could  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner or  a
    relevant child; then
    the decision-maker must consider whether such financial requirement  is
    met through taking  into  account  the  sources  of  income,  financial
    support or funds set out in paragraph 21A(2) of Appendix FM-SE (subject
    to the considerations in sub-paragraphs (3) to (8) of that paragraph).
    (2)  Where  the  financial  requirement  in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1.,  E-
    LTRP.3.1. (in the context of an application for limited leave to remain
    as a partner), E-ECC.2.1. or E-LTRC.2.1. is met following consideration
    under  sub-paragraph  (1)  (and  provided  that  the   other   relevant
    requirements of the Immigration Rules are also met), the applicant will
    be granted entry clearance or leave to remain  under,  as  appropriate,
    paragraph  D-ECP.1.2.,  D-LTRP.1.2.,  D-ECC.1.1.  or   D-LTRC.1.1.   or
    paragraph 315 or 316B of the Immigration Rules.
    GEN.3.2.(1) Subject to sub-paragraph  (4),  where  an  application  for
    entry clearance or leave to enter or remain made under  this  Appendix,
    or an  application  for  leave  to  remain  which  has  otherwise  been
    considered  under  this  Appendix,  does   not   otherwise   meet   the
    requirements of this Appendix or Part 9 of  the  Rules,  the  decision-
    maker must consider whether  the  circumstances  in  sub-paragraph  (2)
    apply.
    (2) Where sub-paragraph (1)  above  applies,  the  decision-maker  must
    consider, on the basis of the information provided  by  the  applicant,
    whether there are exceptional circumstances which would render  refusal
    of entry clearance, or leave to enter or remain, a breach of Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights, because such refusal  would
    result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  the  applicant,  their
    partner, a relevant child or another  family  member  whose  Article  8
    rights it is evident from that  information  would  be  affected  by  a
    decision to refuse the application.
    (3) Where the exceptional circumstances referred  to  in  sub-paragraph
    (2) above apply, the applicant will be granted entry clearance or leave
    to enter or remain under,  as  appropriate,  paragraph  D-ECP.1.2.,  D-
    LTRP.1.2., D-ECC.1.1.,  D-LTRC.1.1.,  D-  ECPT.1.2.,  D-LTRPT.1.2.,  D-
    ECDR.1.1. or D-ECDR.1.2.
    (4) This paragraph does not apply in the context of  applications  made
    under section BPILR or DVILR.
    GEN.3.3.(1) In considering an application for entry clearance or  leave
    to enter or remain where paragraph GEN.3.1. or  GEN.3.2.  applies,  the
    decision-maker must take into account, as a primary consideration,  the
    best interests of any relevant child.
    (2) In paragraphs GEN.3.1. and GEN.3.2., and this paragraph,  "relevant
    child" means a person who:
    (a) is under the age of 18 years at the date of the application; and
    (b) it is evident from the information provided by the applicant  would
    be affected by a decision to refuse the application."
Section 55

44. Mr Lindsay accepts that s.55 considerations are  "capable  in  principle
of forming a factor relevant to proportionality." In point of fact,  it  can
be seen from GEN.3.1-GEN. 3.3 (cited above), that it is now[3] part  of  the
Immigration Rules that "[i]n considering an application for entry  clearance
or leave to enter or remain where paragraph GEN.3.3.1 or  GEN.3.2.  applies,
the decision-maker must take into account, as a primary  consideration,  the
best interests of any relevant child." (emphasis added).  GEN.3.3.2  defines
'relevant child'  to  mean  a  person  who  is  under  18  at  the  date  of
application and "(b) it is evident from  the  information  provided  by  the
applicant would be affected  by  a  decision  to  refuse  the  application."
Reflecting that these mandatory provisions have been put into  practice,  we
note that the ECO  refusal  decision  in  this  case  states  in  its  third
paragraph  that  "[t]his  decision  takes  into   account   as   a   primary
consideration the best interests of any relevant child in line with  section
55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009."

45.  GEN.  3.3  (1)(b)  and  GEN.  3.2(2)  clarify  that   the   exceptional
circumstances at issue relate to those which would render refusal  of  entry
clearance, or leave to enter or  remain,  a  breach  of  Article  8  of  the
European Convention on Human Rights.

46. Moreover, even before the change to the Rules made in  August  2017,  it
was well-settled that for the purposes of entry  clearance  decision-making,
the best interests of the children were still be taken  into  account:  see,
e.g. SM(Algeria)(Appellant) v  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  UK  Visa  Section
(Respondent) [2018] UKSC 9 at [19]; MM(Lebanon)  at  [109];  Mundeba  [2013]
UKUT 00088 (IAC); T (s.55 BCIA 2009 - entry clearance) Jamaica [2011]  UKUT
00483(IAC).

Statutory provisions and Section 117B(6)

47. Section 117A-D of the 2002 Act only apply where a court or  tribunal  is
considering  human  rights  claims  (s117A(1)).  Section  117B(6)   provides
protection for persons in a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
qualifying child who is defined in s. 117D(1)  to mean   a  British  citizen
child or a child who has lived in the UK for a continuous  period  of  seven
years or more. From this it is clear that for British citizen  children  who
fall within the geographical scope of s.117B(6) (see next  paragraph)  there
is no residential  requirement;  they  are  qualifying  children  merely  by
virtue of their nationality (however, even the person who has  a  subsisting
parental  relationship  with  a  qualifying  child  cannot   succeed   under
s.117B(6) unless also able to show that  "it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
expect  the  child  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom";  the  child's  British
citizenship is not enough on its own).

48. We consider  both  parties  correct  to  view  s.117B(6)  as  having  no
application in entry clearance cases, since geographical scope  is  integral
to its wording. That its sole concern is with persons in  the  UK  is  clear
from its reference to a "removal" from the  UK  of  persons  in  a  parental
relationship with a child and from its reference, as  regards  the  relevant
child, to whether "(b) it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
leave the UK (emphasis added). For that reason we think Mr  Lewis  goes  too
far in asking us to regard the underlying policy of Parliament expressed  in
this subparagraph as being to give substantial weight to the  possession  of
British citizenship irrespective  of  geographical  location.  There  is  no
equivalent to  s.117B(6)  in  any  provision  relating  to  entry  clearance
applicants. We cannot assume that is unintentional. That said, as  we  shall
come back to, we consider it consistent with Home Office policy to  treat  a
child's possession of British nationality as a relevant consideration.

The Immigration Rules

49. In relation to in-country  applications,  there  are  immigration  rules
that provide eligibility to  applicants  having  a  genuine  and  subsisting
relationship with a British citizen  child.  These  broadly  complement  the
protection  against  removal  afforded  by  s.117B(6)  in  the  context   of
decisions  by  courts  and  tribunals.  Paragraph   EX.1,   which   concerns
exceptions to certain eligibility requirements for  leave  to  remain  as  a
partner or parent, is predicated, in the same way as  is  s.117B(6),  on  it
"not being reasonable to expect the [qualifying] child   to  leave  the  UK"
(EX.1(a) (ii)).  Paragraph  R-LTRPT.1.1,  which  concerns  requirements  for
limited leave to remain as a parent,  includes  a  relationship  requirement
that covers a child who is "a British citizen or  settled  in  the  UK"  (E-
LTRPT.2.2(c), but by E-LTRPT.2.2(b) the child concerned must be  "living  in
the UK".
50. In relation to entry clearance applications, Section E-ECPT  includes  a
route for parents of a child who is either a British citizen or  settled  in
the UK (E-ECPT.2.2(c)), but (again) the child must be "living  in  the  UK".
The Rules do provide at GEN.1.3(c) that for  the  purposes  of  Appendix  FM
"references to a British citizen in the UK also include  a  British  citizen
who is coming to the UK with the  applicant  as  their  partner  or  parent"
(emphasis added) but in  the  case  of  a  British  citizen  child  with  an
applicant parent the only applicable rules currently are those  set  out  in
GEN. 3.1 - GEN. 3.3. under the heading "Exceptional  circumstances".  As  we
have seen, EX.1 does not apply when applicants apply from abroad  for  entry
clearance, even though they have British citizen children in the UK.
51. Although there is no path, therefore, for parents of a  British  citizen
child not living in the UK under the main routes to entry clearance set  out
in Appendix FM, GEN.3.3.2 does require the  decision-maker,  in  considering
whether there are exceptional circumstances  giving  rise  to  a  breach  of
Article 8 because such a refusal  (including  refusal  of  entry  clearance)
"would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  applicant,  their
partner, a relevant child or another family member whose  Article  8  rights
it is evident from that information would  be  affected  by  a  decision  to
refuse  the  application."  (emphasis  added).  That  clearly  requires  the
decision-maker to take into  account  the  impact  on  any  relevant  child,
although  the  definition  of  "relevant  child"  makes  no   reference   to
nationality. We shall come back to this aspect of the Rules later on.

Policy
52. We asked Mr Lindsay to clarify whether or not  the  respondent  had  any
existing policy  instructions  or  other  guidance  specifically  for  Entry
Clearance Officers. He stated that the existing guidance  was  contained  in
the Home Office Family  Policy:  Family  life  (as  a  partner  or  parent),
private life and exceptional circumstances.  He produced Version 3.0,  dated
23 September 2019 (we note in passing that since the hearing there is now  a
Version 4, with the same title, dated 1 November 2019,  but  in  respect  of
the parts relevant to this case, it is in identical terms). Although  stated
as being "published for  Home  Office  staff",  it  expressly  states  in  a
subsection headed "Purpose" that:
    "[t]his guidance must be used for all decisions (emphasis added):
         under paragraph 276ADE(1) of Part 7 (private life)
         under paragraphs  277-280,  289AA  and  295AA  of  Part  8  (family
         circumstances (family life cases
         under  Appendix  FM  including  on   the   basis   of   exceptional
         circumstances (family life) in accordance with  GEN.3.1  to  GEN.33
         [which as we have seen encompasses entry clearance applications]
         outside of the  Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  of  exceptional
         circumstances (private life)".
53. Correspondingly, this document includes sections  specifically  relating
to entry clearance applications: see e.g. page 31 dealing with "Decision  to
refuse entry clearance or leave to remain".
54. Mr Lindsay also produced the Immigration Directorate Instruction  Family
Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.7 Appendix Armed Forces, August 2017.  This
expressly states in the  Introduction  that  "[f]or  the  purposes  of  this
guidance "decision-makers" means Entry Clearance Officers and  caseworkers."

55. The Family Policy  guidance  deals,  inter  alia,  with  the  in-country
immigration rules relating to British citizen children and includes at  page
50, under the heading "Is it reasonable for the child  to  leave  the  UK?",
the statement that: "[t]he starting point is  that  we  would  not  normally
expect a qualifying child to leave the UK. It is normally in a child's  best
interests for the whole family to remain together, which means if the  child
is not expected to leave, then the parent or parents  or  primary  carer  of
the child will also not be expected to leave the UK."  But  it  contains  no
similar provisions relating to British citizen children who are  abroad.  It
does repeat the wording  of  GEN.3.3.  (page  46)  and  in  the  section  on
Exceptional Circumstances (which is  expressly  stated  to  apply  to  entry
clearance and leave to remain applications (page 66)), it is noted that  its
provisions "enable Entry  Clearance  Officers  to  conduct  full  Article  8
considerations under Appendix FM, removing the need  to  refer  those  entry
clearance cases that potentially raise exceptional circumstances  (requiring
leave to be granted on Article 8 grounds) to the  Referred  Casework  Unit'"
(page 67). In a subsection headed Overview it is stated that:
    "These changes in the Immigration Rules have  2  key  implications  for
    Entry Clearance Officers and caseworkers  deciding  applications  under
    Appendix FM.
    First, where an application for entry clearance  or  limited  leave  to
    remain as a partner or child under Appendix FM does not otherwise  meet
    the minimum income requirement applicable under paragraph E-ECP.3.1., E-
    ECC.2.1., E- LTRP.3.1. or E-LTRC.2.1.:
    Then, under paragraphs GEN.3.1. and GEN.3.3. of Appendix FM,  you  must
    consider whether refusal of the application could breach ECHR Article 8
    because it could result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  the
    applicant, their partner  or  a  relevant  child.  In  conducting  this
    assessment, you must have regard to all of the information and evidence
    provided by the applicant. You must take into  account,  as  a  primary
    consideration, the best interests of any relevant child.
    Where, under paragraph GEN.3.1.  of  Appendix  FM,  you  consider  that
    refusal could  breach  ECHR  Article  8  because  it  could  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner or  a
    relevant child, you must give the  applicant  an  opportunity  to  show
    whether the minimum income requirement can be  met  through  any  other
    credible and reliable source(s) of income, financial support  or  funds
    available to the couple.
    If the applicant  has  not  already  done  so,  you  must  contact  the
    applicant (or their legal representative) in  writing  giving  them  21
    days in which to provide information and evidence  in  writing  of  any
    other credible and reliable source(s) of income, financial  support  or
    funds  available  to  the  couple  which  enables  the  minimum  income
    requirement to be met. This can be in addition to, or in place of,  the
    income or funds on which the application relied.
    Appendix  FM  1.7:  financial  requirement  provides  guidance  on  the
    application  of  paragraph  21A  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  which  sets  out
    objective  criteria  by  which  you  will   assess   the   genuineness,
    credibility and reliability  of  other  sources  of  income,  financial
    support or funds.
    Second, where an application for entry clearance or  limited  leave  to
    remain under Appendix FM does not otherwise meet  the  requirements  of
    that Appendix or Part 9 of the rules:
    Then, under paragraphs GEN.3.2. and GEN.3.3. of Appendix FM,  you  must
    consider whether there are exceptional circumstances which would render
    refusal of the application a breach of ECHR Article 8 because it  would
    result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant  or  their
    family. In conducting this assessment, you must have regard to  all  of
    the information and evidence provided by the applicant. You  must  take
    into account, as a primary consideration, the  best  interests  of  any
    relevant child."
56. At page 69 a 'relevant child' is stated to mean the same as it  does  in
GEN.3.3.(2), namely, a person who:

    "is under the age of 18 years at the date of application


    it is evident from the information provided by the applicant  would  be
    affected by a decision to refuse the application."

Case law
57. The two key cases prayed in aid by Mr  Lewis  in  support  of  his  main
arguments were the Supreme Court decisions in ZH(Tanzania) [2011] 2  AC  166
and Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 34.
58. In ZH (Tanzania) Lady Hale, in  analysing  the  relevance  of  the  best
interests of the child as a primary  consideration,  observed  at  [30]  and
[32] that:

    "30. Although nationality is not a "trump card"  it  is  of  particular
    importance in assessing the best interests  of  any  child.  The  UNCRC
    recognises the right of every child to  be  registered  and  acquire  a
    nationality (Article 7) and to preserve  her  identity,  including  her
    nationality (Article 8).  In  Wan,  the  Federal  Court  of  Australia,
    pointed out at para 30 that, when considering the  possibility  of  the
    children accompanying their father  to  China,  the  tribunal  had  not
    considered any of  the  following  matters,  which  the  Court  clearly
    regarded as important:
    "(a) the fact that the children, as citizens  of  Australia,  would  be
    deprived of the country of their own and  their  mother's  citizenship,
    'and of its protection and support, socially, culturally and medically,
    and in many other ways evoked  by,  but  not  confined  to,  the  broad
    concept of lifestyle' (Vaitaiki v Minister for Immigration  and  Ethnic
    Affairs [1998] FCA 5, (1998) 150 ALR 608, 614);
    (b) the resultant social and linguistic disruption of  their  childhood
    as well as the loss of their homeland;
    (c) the loss of educational opportunities available to the children  in
    Australia; and
    (d) their resultant isolation from the normal contacts of children with
    their mother and their mother's family."
    ...
    32. Nor should the intrinsic importance of citizenship be played  down.
    As citizens these children have rights which they will not be  able  to
    exercise if they move to another country. They will lose the advantages
    of growing up and being  educated  in  their  own  country,  their  own
    culture and their own language. They will have lost all this when  they
    come back as adults. [Emphasis added]  As  Jacqueline  Bhaba  (in  'The
    "Mere Fortuity of Birth"? Children, Mothers, Borders and the Meaning of
    Citizenship', in Migrations and Mobilities:  Citizenship,  Borders  and
    Gender (2009), edited by Seyla Benhabib and Judith Resnik,  at  p  193)
    has put it:
         'In short, the fact of belonging to a country fundamentally affects
         the manner of exercise of a child's family and private life, during
         childhood  and  well  beyond.  Yet  children,  particularly   young
         children, are often considered  parcels  that  are  easily  movable
         across borders with their parents and without  particular  cost  to
         the children.'"
59. In Zoumbas,  Lord  Hodge,  having  identified  as  one  of  seven  legal
principles to govern best interests of the child assessment  in  immigration
cases that:
    "(3) Although the best interests of a child can be  outweighed  by  the
    cumulative effect of other considerations, no other  consideration  can
    be treated as inherently more significant; ..."
stated that:
    "12. Mr Lindsay [a different Mr Lindsay] for Mr Zoumbas also founded on
    a statement in the judgment of Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore in ZH (Tanzania)
    at para 46 in support of the proposition that what is determined to  be
    in a child's best interests should customarily dictate the  outcome  of
    cases and that it will require considerations of substantial moment  to
    permit a different result. In our view, it is important  to  note  that
    Lord Kerr's formulation spoke of dictating the outcome of  cases  "such
    as the present" and that in ZH (Tanzania) the court  was  dealing  with
    children who were British citizens. In that case the children by virtue
    of their nationality had significant benefits,  including  a  right  of
    abode and rights to future education and healthcare  in  this  country,
    which the children in this case, as citizens of the Republic of  Congo,
    do not. The benefits of British citizenship are an important factor  in
    assessing whether  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  a  child  with  such
    citizenship to live in another country.  Moreover  in  H(H)  Lord  Kerr
    explained (at para 145) that what he was seeking to  say  was  that  no
    factor should be given greater weight than the interests  of  a  child.
    See the third principle above." [Emphasis added]
60. The difficulty for us in seeking to apply  the  guidance  in  these  two
cases is that the Supreme Court was concerned in both  cases  with  children
who were in the UK and with issues relating to removal of their  parents  or
the children themselves. Neither dealt with the context of  entry  clearance
and British children living abroad.
61. That said, the unanimous decision of the Supreme  Court  in  MM(Lebanon)
observed at [80] that the Minimum Income Requirement (MIR):
     "has caused, and will continue to cause significant hardship  to  many
    thousands of couples who have good reasons for wanting  to  make  their
    lives together in this country and to  their  children.  Of  particular
    concern is the impact upon the children of these couples, many or  even
    most of whom will be British citizens themselves. These are illustrated
    in a Report commissioned by the Office of the  Children's  Commissioner
    for England, Family Friendly: The Impact  on  Children  of  the  Family
    Migration  Rules:  A  Review  of  the  Financial  Requirements   (2015,
    Middlesex  University  and  the  Joint  Council  for  the  Welfare   of
    Immigrants)."
62. This report, we observe, drew on empirical survey evidence  to  identify
that separation of families can cause significant behavioural  problems  for
the children involved and that  of  the  15,000  children  estimated  to  be
affected by the MIR the vast majority were British citizens (see 3.6,  3.8).
At 4.3 the report stated that among those affected  were  "[o]ther  children
[who] are prevented from returning to the UK, their country of  nationality,
and are effectively exiled abroad in countries with  far  lower  health  and
education standards."
63. Nevertheless, at [81] the Supreme Court said:
    "But the fact that a rule causes hardship to many, including  some  who
    are in no way to blame  for  the  situation  in  which  they  now  find
    themselves, does not mean that it is incompatible with  the  Convention
    rights or otherwise unlawful at common law."
64. It is, in our view, pertinent that  the  Supreme  Court,  despite  being
aware of the fact that a significant number of the children  concerned  will
be British citizens, did not identify that as a factor of profound  or  even
material significance in the determination of whether Article 8 compels  the
United Kingdom to admit  a  third  country  national  who  cannot  meet  the
requirements of the immigration rules. This is unsurprising,  in  the  light
of the  Court's  analysis  at  [40]  to  [44]  of  the  relevant  Strasbourg
jurisprudence, which conspicuously  has  not  identified  nationality  as  a
necessarily weighty matter in reunification cases. We  shall  have  more  to
say on this matter at paragraph 63 below.
65. It is clear that in Article 8 jurisprudence nationality  is  a  relevant
consideration both in the deportation/removal and the  immigration  context.
Thus,  in  ZH  (Tanzania)  Lady  Hale  at  [17]  made   reference   to   the
identification by the Strasbourg Court of relevant factors to be taken  into
consideration in cases concerned with the  expulsion  of  long-settled  non-
nationals who had committed criminal offences. She noted that  the  relevant
factors which had first been enunciated in Boultif v Switzerland  (2001)  33
EHRR 50 (numbers inserted) were:
    "[i] the nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offence  committed  by  the
    applicant;
    [ii] the length of the applicant's stay in the country from which he or
    she is to be expelled;
    [iii] the  time  elapsed  since  the  offence  was  committed  and  the
    applicant's conduct during that period;
    [iv]  the nationalities of the various persons concerned;
    [v]  the applicant's family  situation,  such  as  the  length  of  the
    marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness of a  couple's
    family life;
    [vi] whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when  he  or
    she entered into a family relationship;
    [vii] whether there are children of the marriage, and if so, their age;
    and
    [viii] the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse  is  likely
    to encounter in the country to which the appellant is to be  expelled."
    [Emphasis added]
66. She further noted that this list of factors was  approved  and  expanded
upon in Uner v The Netherlands (2007) 45 EHRR 421.
67.  At  [180]  Lady  Hale  noted  that  "[f]actors  (i),  (iii),  and  (vi)
identified in Boultif and U?ner are not relevant when it comes  to  ordinary
immigration cases, although the equivalent of (vi) for a spouse  is  whether
family  life  was  established  knowing  of  the   precariousness   of   the
immigration situation." Notably she did not exclude the  relevance  of  (iv)
"the nationalities of the various persons concerned".
68. Alongside the applicable principles set out  in  Boultif  and  Uner  and
other cases, the Strasbourg Court has identified a  number  of  propositions
particular to the context of entry clearance or  admission.  The  applicable
principles have been stated by the Court in its G�l judgment  [Case  of  G�l
Switzerland, app.no. 23218]  as follows (loc. cit.,�38):

    "(a) The extent of a State's  obligation  to  admit  to  its  territory
    relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to  the  particular
    circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest.
    (b) As a matter of well-established international law  and  subject  to
    its treaty obligations, a State has the right to control the  entry  of
    non-nationals into its territory.
    (c) Where immigration is concerned, Article 8 cannot be  considered  to
    impose on a State a general obligation to respect immigrants' choice of
    the country of their matrimonial  residence  and  to  authorise  family
    reunion in its territory."


69. These principles have been reiterated in a number  of  cases,  including
Ahmut  v  Netherlands  (73/1995/579/665)  26  October   1996   and   Sen   v
Netherlands,  Application  no.  31465/96,  21  December  2001.  In  Ahmut  v
Netherlands, directly after restating these principles, the Court stated  at
paragraph 68 that:


    "68. Accordingly, as in the G�l case, in order to establish  the  scope
    of the State's obligations, the facts of the case  must  be  considered
    [emphasis added]."


70. In Sen v Netherlands at paragraphs 31-40 the  Court  took  into  account
the age of the child concerned, her situation in her country of  origin  and
the level of dependence in relation to her parents. It  further  noted  that
the present case had  certain  common  points  with  the  situation  of  the
applicants in the case Ahmut where no violation of Article 8 had been  found
based on the facts of the case. It took note of  the  fact  that  the  third
applicant in the case in hand was supported by her aunt and uncle after  her
mother's departure to the Netherlands; she lived all  her  life  in  Turkey,
part of her family was still living  there  and  she  had  therefore  strong
links  with  the  linguistic  and  cultural  environment  of  her   country.
However, contrary to its judgement in the case of Ahmut, the Court  assessed
that in the present case there was a major obstacle  in  returning  the  Sen
family to Turkey. The parents were beneficiaries of permits to stay  in  the
Netherlands and had established their life as a couple in  the  Netherlands,
where they had lived legally since many years and where  two  more  children
were born. Those two children lived their whole lives  in  the  Netherlands,
in the cultural and educational  environment  of  this  country.  Therefore,
they have little or no connection with their country of origin. Under  these
conditions, the most appropriate way to develop family life was,  given  the
young age of the third applicant, by bringing her to the Netherlands.
71. Taking stock of the relevant Strasbourg jurisprudence on Article  8,  we
derive that (i) Article 8 cannot be  considered  to  impose  on  a  State  a
general obligation to respect immigrants' choice of  the  country  of  their
matrimonial residence and to authorise  family  reunion  in  its  territory;
(ii) a relevant factor that must be taken into account is the  nationalities
of the various persons concerned; and (iii) in order to establish the  scope
of the State's obligations, the facts of the case  must  be  considered.  In
relation to (ii), we cannot find  any  support  in  this  jurisprudence  for
extending this to include a principle that having a  British  citizen  child
furnishes "powerful reasons" for granting admission or  entry  clearance  or
that "substantial weight" must be  given  to  a  child's  nationality.  What
weight is to be given appears to be left as a matter  for  each  Contracting
State's "margin of appreciation". As regards (iii), we  would  observe  that
in this  regard  the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  reflects  our  own  initial
observations on the significance of nationality at  the  level  of  abstract
principle, in particular  that  the  rights  and  benefits  that  attach  to
nationality will depend heavily on the particular circumstances.
Private life

72. Mr Lewis sought to augment  his  submissions  by  arguing  that  in  the
context of entry clearance applications the Article  8(1)  rights  to  which
the appellant  is  entitled  are  not  confined  to  family  life  but  also
encompass private  life.  For  him  this  is  an  important  factor  because
Strasbourg jurisprudence has recognised  the  right  to  nationality  as  an
aspect of a person's private life: see e.g. R (Johnson) v SSHD [2016] 3  WLR
1267 and Genovese v Malta (2014) 58 EHRR 25. He acknowledged that  at  first
sight this limb of his argument was contrary to Court  of  Appeal  authority
(Abbas v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1393),  but  submitted  that  the  appellant's
case could be distinguished from Abbas in several respects.

73. Whilst we agree with Mr Lewis that Abbas case addresses a  significantly
different factual scenario (a proposed visit to an uncle) and that  it  does
not address the situation of a British citizen child or  indeed  any  child,
we are unable to accept that in this decision the Court of Appeal  envisaged
any  exceptions  to  its  broadly  expressed  statement  at  the  level   of
"principle" that the right to respect for private life was  not  engaged  in
entry clearance cases. At [18] the Lord Chief  Justice  stated  that:  "[t]o
accept  that  the  private  life  aspect  of  article  8  could  require   a
Contracting State to allow an alien to enter  its  territory  would  mark  a
step change in the reach of article 8  in  the  immigration  context.  As  a
matter of principle it would be wrong to do so."

74. We consider that this decision binds  us  not  to  have  regard  to  the
appellant's right to respect for private life in the  context  of  an  entry
clearance application.

75. At the same time, we do not view  this  as  precluding  us  from  having
regard to the relevance of nationality, since, as  we  have  seen,  that  is
clearly one of the factors that decision-makers must take into account  when
considering the proportionality  of  any  interference  with  the  right  to
respect for family life. Indeed, it would be wholly  artificial  and  simply
wrong to hollow out, from the material scope  of  a  person's  family  life,
considerations going  to  factors  such  as  their  nationality  and  social
identity.

The appellant's case

76. The sponsor did not give evidence before us.  He  gave  evidence  before
Judge Burns and the bundle of documents submitted for that hearing  included
witness statements from him  and  the  appellant  (both  undated  but  circa
second half of 2018). In her witness statement the appellant said  that  she
had met the sponsor in 2010 when was visiting a friend in  hospital  in  Sri
Lanka. In 2011 he came back to Sri Lanka. They married in November 2011  and
after their marriage lived together "in our house". She  had  two  children.
He went back to the UK in November  2017  to  work  as  an  Assistant  Sales
Manager in a betting company.  She was presently  living  with  her  parents
who were old and fragile. Both her children missed their father  very  much.
The sponsor's witness statement  averred,  inter  alia,  that  his  children
attend an International school (the bundle included a number of school  fees
receipts from the school in question) and he regularly sends money for  them
to live in Sri Lanka (in the bundle there were various remittance  receipts)
"but my children want to be with me. I came [back] to  live  in  the  UK  in
order to educate my children." He did not want to go back to  Sri  Lanka  as
his  interests  are  only  in  his  children's  education  and  their   best
interests. In addition to various  documents  relating  to  the  appellant's
qualifications and employment as a nurse, the sponsor's  employment  history
and financial details, the bundle  also  included  a  statutory  declaration
stating that he lived in  accommodation  which  had  one  double  room  with
sharing facilities of toilet, kitchen and bathroom.

77. In the appellant's bundle  produced  for  the  hearing  before  us,  the
sponsor (in an undated but clearly recent witness statement) states that  he
has always worked and always supported his family. In  2017  he  had  worked
for Betfred as an Assistant Sales Manager and had  then  found  another  job
(in December 2018) as a Slow Sand Filter technician with Thames Water on  an
annual salary of �22,500 but had unfortunately lost that  job  following  an
accident at work that had happened due to the daily pressure and  stress  he
was under. He was hopeful that he would get another job soon  but  he  could
not easily describe how stressful has been his separation from his wife  and
the legal proceedings that have followed.  He  had  gone  to  Sri  Lanka  in
2010. He is good with languages and picked up Tamil  very  quickly.  He  had
met his wife at a hospital where she was working.   He  had  had  wanted  to
bring her to the UK to really make "our home and family in the UK" and  they
had made their first application for her visa in December 2011,  soon  after
they had  married.  This  had  been  refused  because  "they  suggested  our
marriage was not genuine". He noted that their two children,  both  attended
an English-speaking school for which he paid the fees. Both children are bi-
lingual (Tamil and English).  The children  attend  English-speaking  events
like the British Lankan Festival.  He  keeps  in  touch  with  his  children
daily through FaceTime. It "breaks my  heart  every  time  to  see  them  on
FaceTime and let them go". They are excited about moving to the UK. He  also
describes what happened when his daughter came to the UK for a visit (on  an
unspecified date), when he found it difficult to cope.  He  states  that  to
bring his children to the UK without his wife "is not  doable.  I  tried.  I
need my wife and my children and we will all support one another." He  found
it very difficult without his family. He has a tenancy for a 2-bedroom  flat
in anticipation of his family's arrival in the UK.  His wife  has  to  bring
up the children by herself as she is unable to come to the UK.  If  they  do
not come soon they will find it difficult to adjust. He did not want  to  go
back to Sri Lanka as he did not really think it would be in  his  children's
best interests.  His wife is a qualified  nurse/phlebotomist  and  also  has
training as an assistant midwife. She is currently being  offered  a  senior
care assistant job at �10 an hour at a care home in Surrey. She had a  video
interview for this and impressed the prospective  employer;  but  they  will
only keep the job offer open so long.  "I really don't  understand  what  is
the point of my kids having British passports if we can't come to  the  UK".
He has been going back and forth to Sri Lanka  since  2012  which  has  cost
thousands of pounds.

78. In the same bundle there  is  an  undated  but  clearly  recent  witness
statement from the appellant. It largely reiterates what  she  said  in  her
earlier statement.  She states that her  children  are  always  asking  when
they will go to the UK and want to be with their  dad  all  the  time.   She
states that the sponsor had gone back to the UK "in order to prepare for  us
to come to the UK and to start our life afresh in London."  He  sends  money
for the children's schooling and everyday expenses. She states that she  has
a job offer to work as a senior care assistant in a nursing  home  close  to
their house in London. The past 8 years has been very difficult and  she  is
finding it difficult to manage with  her  children  without  their  father's
help.  She is presently living with her parents who are old and fragile  and
find it difficult with young children around all the time.  She feels  their
children needs a healthier environment. (The appellant's  witness  statement
also refers to her being in work but Mr Lewis clarified that at the date  of
hearing she was not working.)

79. The appellant's bundle for  this  hearing  also  contains  a  number  of
documents relating to the sponsor's history of  visits  to  Sri  Lanka,  air
ticket receipts, his recent work history and his  payments  of  school  fees
and remittances to his wife, the appellant's educational  and  work  history
and her English language qualifications. There is a letter to the  appellant
dated 16 October 2019 from [a care home in Surrey]  offering  her  permanent
employment as a Senior Care Assistant with them for a minimum of 39 hours  a
week at an hourly rate of �10 per hour. The manager states  that  the  offer
will only be kept open for 3 months. Also in the appellant's  bundle  was  a
letter from the sponsor's GP dated 7 October 2019 stating that  the  sponsor
suffered  from  depression  and  was  on  medication  to  help  manage   his
condition. The fact that his wife and two children live  in  Sri  Lanka  was
said  to  be  affecting  his  mental  health  condition  and  worsening  his
depression.  The doctor states that if the sponsor  is  unable  to  live  or
reunite with his family, his condition  could  further  deteriorate.   Among
other documents was an award certificate to  the  appellant's  daughter  for
being an "All Island  Finalist"  in  the  British  Lanka  Festival  for  the
Performing Arts in verse speaking.

80. We remind ourselves that in respect of  the  appellant's  and  sponsor's
current circumstances Mr Lewis told us on instructions that the sponsor  was
no longer in work due to health problems, including anxiety and  depression.
Nor is the appellant working in Sri Lanka presently,  although  she  has  an
offer of employment as a nurse carer in the UK.

The Immigration Rules: Appendices FM and FM-SE

81. Dealing firstly with the appellant's  situation  under  the  Immigration
Rules, we regard it as manifest that she did not  meet  the  Minimum  Income
Requirements  (MIR)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  either  at  the  date   of
application or decision. Indeed, so much was conceded by  the  appellant  in
the skeleton  argument.  She  had  failed  to  provide  requisite  documents
pursuant to Appendix FM-SE. The only point raised to suggest that  this  was
not so was to reiterate that the sponsor had  produced  correspondence  from
the HMRC confirming that he had been paid �19,612  for  the  financial  year
April 2016 to April 2017 (we  note  that  there  was  also  a  P60  provided
relating to that same year), but (as was  properly  noted  by  Judge  Burns)
HMRC correspondence is not included in the relevant evidential  requirements
in FM-SE. Furthermore, both at the date of application  and  decision  there
were discrepancies in the evidence the sponsor had submitted in the form  of
payslips and bank statements. Judge Burns had also  found  that  there  were
such discrepancies.  In the grounds of appeal before us in this case,  there
has been  no  real  attempt  to  explain  or  dispute  these  discrepancies.
Nevertheless, we do not doubt, and  we  do  not  understand  Mr  Lindsay  to
doubt, that the sponsor was in employment during the times claimed.  But  as
to the level of his income for the  requisite  periods,  the  appellant  has
clearly failed to discharge the onus of  proof  on  her  to  show  that  the
sponsor had met the evidential requirements necessary to establish that  his
gross income exceeded 18,600 either at the date of application  or  decision
or before the First-tier judge. Nor, as we will come to in a moment, can  he
meet the MIR now

The Immigration Rules: GEN.3.1-GEN.3.3(2)

82. That is not, however, the end of  the  examination  of  the  appellant's
position under the Rules. As  noted  earlier,  she  was  still  entitled  to
succeed under them if able  to  show,  pursuant  to  GEN.3.1-GEN.3.3.,  that
there are exceptional circumstances which would render the refusal of  entry
clearance a breach of Article  8  because  such  refusal  "would  result  in
unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  the  applicant,  their  partner,  a
relevant child or another  family  member  whose  Article  8  rights  it  is
evident from that information would be affected by a decision to refuse  the
application." Under this rubric,  we  are  satisfied  from  the  information
before us that the appellant,  the  sponsor,  their  two  children  and  the
sponsor's own family members in the UK would be affected. The only  question
is whether  the  effect  was  such  as  to  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
consequences.  In considering this question we have to bear in mind that  it
is relevant in this context to consider  actual  or  potential  income  from
sources other than the sponsor, in this case the appellant.

Article 8

83. We have already established that we are only concerned, in terms of  the
scope of Article 8, with the right to respect for family life. It is not  in
dispute that the appellant enjoys family life with her husband and with  her
two children. We are not concerned with her right or  the  children's  right
to respect for private life.

84. We unhesitatingly reject Mr Lindsay's contention that the appellant  has
not established an interference with her right to respect for  family  life.
It is well-established that the threshold to establish a  mere  interference
is a relatively low one and Mr Lindsay's  own  submissions  recognised  that
there  were  interferences  in  play,  although  not  ones   he   considered
disproportionate. Article 8 was clearly engaged. The  respondent's  position
on this issue in the  refusal  decision  and  before  us  is  untenable.  It
remains, however, to assess the proportionality  of  the  refusal  of  entry
clearance.

Public interest considerations

85. Turning first to consider the public interest considerations  applicable
in this  case,  it  is  clear  that  there  is  a  public  interest  in  the
maintenance of immigration  control  which  in  the  context  of  a  partner
application for entry clearance has the legitimate  aim  of  furthering  the
economic well-being of the UK.

86. It is an established part of Article 8  jurisprudence  that  (to  repeat
the words used by the Court in Ahmut v Netherlands):

    "(a) The extent of a State's  obligation  to  admit  to  its  territory
    relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to  the  particular
    circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest.
    (b) As a matter of well-established international law  and  subject  to
    its treaty obligations, a State has the right to control the  entry  of
    non-nationals into its territory.
    (c) Where immigration is concerned, Article 8 cannot be  considered  to
    impose on a State a general obligation to respect immigrants' choice of
    the country of their matrimonial  residence  and  to  authorise  family
    reunion in its territory."

87. In  the  appellant's  case,  one  specific  question  that  arises  with
potential impact on the weight we attach to the  public  interest,  concerns
Home Office policy. As noted earlier, neither the legislation nor the  Rules
nor any current Home Office policy expressly identifies  the  fact  that  an
entry clearance applicant has children with British citizenship as a  factor
of any particular weight. There is no entry clearance analogue  of  EX.1  or
s.117B(6). The statement in the Family Policy guidance cited earlier,  about
"not normally" expecting a qualifying child [one subcategory of which  is  a
British citizen] to leave the UK", is not mirrored at  all  in  their  entry
clearance context.

88. The most that can be said,  drawing  on  the  submissions  made  by  the
respondent in MM (Lebanon), is that there is an understanding at  the  level
of policy that the  MIR  can  cause  hardship  and  that  this  rule  has  a
particularly harsh effect on families with  British  citizen  children  (see
[81)]. By the same token, as we noted  above  at  paragraph  55,  Lady  Hale
spelt out in the next paragraph:
     "But the fact that a rule causes hardship to many, including some  who
    are in no way to blame  for  the  situation  in  which  they  now  find
    themselves, does not mean that it is incompatible with  the  Convention
    rights or otherwise unlawful at common law."
89. The defects the Supreme Court discerned in the  Rules  and  Home  Office
guidance at the time were subsequently addressed by the respondent,  notably
by way of the amendments made within GEN.3.3-3.1 in August 2017.

90.  Applicants who have a British citizen child will  be  able  to  require
the respondent to have regard to that fact, as one  of  the  matters  to  be
considered in undertaking her  Article  8  assessment  at  large.  As  noted
earlier, nationality is one of the  factors  recognised  by  the  Strasbourg
jurisprudence on Article 8 in family life cases as  a  relevant  factor.  An
entry clearance applicant with a British citizen child is entitled  to  have
that factor considered as relevant in a way that an applicant with a  purely
foreign national child is not. However, beyond this we are not permitted  to
go. It is abundantly clear from what we have stated  earlier  regarding  the
Article 8 case law, drawing on the principles  set  out  in  Boultif,  Uner,
Ahmut v Netherlands among other case - and our own analysis  of  nationality
and British citizenship - that the  degree  of  weight  to  be  attached  to
nationality will always depend  on  the  particular  circumstances  and  the
individual facts and that it  is  not  regarded  as  a  necessarily  weighty
matter. There is also the point  that  a  dual  national  child  enjoys  the
benefits  of  his  or  her  other  nationality.  There  is  nothing  in  the
Strasbourg or domestic jurisprudence  that  requires  the  respondent  or  a
tribunal, as a general  matter,  to  ascribe  greater  significance  to  the
child's European/British citizenship than to the citizenship  of  the  other
country. That is unsurprising, since any such requirement risks  being  seen
as a form of Eurocentric arrogance.


The position of the sponsor

91. Given that the appellant stated in  her  application  form  in  mid-2017
that "[d]uring my stay in the UK our children will be  looked  after  by  my
parents",  we  do  not  consider  this  a  case  where  there  has  been  an
unqualified wish expressed by their parents since their birth  for  them  to
live in the  UK.   However,  albeit  the  evidence  is  incomplete,  we  are
prepared to accept that as time has gone on, especially in view of the  fact
that it would appear that the appellant's parents are now old and frail  and
that the sponsor has psychological  problems,  both  parents  are  now  more
intent on the appellant and her children coming to join the sponsor. We  are
satisfied that one of the reasons behind the couple placing  their  children
in an English speaking school (and keeping them there) is  to  prepare  them
for life in the UK.

The option of the children joining the sponsor in the UK on their own

92. Mr Lindsay has asked us to regard it as a viable  option,  reducing  any
possible disproportionality in the decision, for the  children  to  come  to
the UK to attend school in term time and  return  to  their  mother  in  the
holidays. We do not rule out that  in  some  cases  that  may  be  a  viable
option, but on the evidence  before  us  in  this  case,  although  somewhat
sketchy, we consider such an option  to  be  unrealistic.  The  sponsor  had
found it difficult looking after one of the children on  his  own  during  a
short visit to the UK circa 2016. There are air tickets in  the  appellant's
bundle confirming this trip together with her father and the sponsor in  his
latest witness statement refers to him being found crying in the  middle  of
the road with his daughter (then 3) during that visit.  He  states  that  he
was taken to a police station and she  was  taken  into  care  for  3  weeks
whilst he was assessed as to his mental health (during this time he  was  in
Great Yarmouth and she was in London). At the end of that  period  she  came
back to live with him, but (he stated) "I still couldn't cope looking  after
her by myself" and he then took her back to Sri  Lanka,  selling  things  to
pay for the fares. Given that the letter from his GP states  that  he  still
has psychological problems, we do not consider  that  it  would  be  in  the
children's best interests for him to be put in the position of  being  their
sole carer, even assuming the appellant, who has always been  their  primary
carer, was happy to be separated from her children in this way.

The option of the sponsor returning to Sri Lanka

93.  Mr Lindsay has submitted that it was reasonable to expect  the  sponsor
to move to or go and live in Sri Lanka in order for  their  family  life  to
take place in that country. Mr Lewis  opposes  that,  submitting  that  that
there would be insurmountable obstacles in the way of the sponsor doing  so.
He highlights that the sponsor is categorical that he does not  want  to  go
back and live in Sri Lanka We find  the  evidence  relating  to  this  issue
somewhat mixed. The  sponsor  had  lived  there  before:  between  2011  and
November 2017 he appears to have spent a considerable amount of time  there.
He says he has learnt Tamil. Even though he expressed concerns  about  being
able to find properly remunerated employment there, he did have a job  there
for two months and he has not  raised  any  other  concerns  about  his  own
position if residing there. Although the  sponsor  suffers  from  depression
and psychological problems, both he and his GP describe  this  as  resulting
from his separation from his wife and children. Even if being reunited  with
his family did not relieve or reduce his depression, there  was  no  medical
evidence, and it was not suggested by Mr Lewis, that he would be  unable  to
access medical help for this condition in  Sri  Lanka.  Notwithstanding  his
depression, he had worked and even after his recent  accident,  he  said  he
was hopeful of finding work soon. On the other hand, it is clear  that  both
the sponsor and the appellant badly want to live together  as  a  family  in
the UK and that is also the keen wish of their children. If  he  returns  to
Sri Lanka to be with them, even though it is likely he will be able to  find
employment there,  as  he  did  before,  it  may  well  be  at  a  level  of
remuneration lower than that required to meet the MIR.
94. Weighing up the above considerations, we are satisfied that the  sponsor
returning to live in Sri Lanka would cause  difficulties.  But  we  are  not
satisfied that for him to go and live in Sri Lanka  with  his  family  would
pose   insurmountable   obstacles   or   result   in   unjustifiably   harsh
consequences. We remind ourselves what was said in relation to the  test  of
"insurmountable obstacles" in R (on the application of Agyarko)  (Appellant)
v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2017]  UKSC.  The
Supreme Court stated at [45] that:
    "By virtue of paragraph EX.1(b), "insurmountable obstacles" are treated
    as a requirement for the grant of leave under the  Rules  in  cases  to
    which that paragraph applies. Accordingly, interpreting the  expression
    in the same sense as in the Strasbourg case law, leave to remain  would
    not normally be granted in cases where an applicant for leave to remain
    under the partner route was in the UK in breach  of  immigration  laws,
    unless  the  applicant  or  their  partner  would  face  very   serious
    difficulties in continuing their family life together outside  the  UK,
    which could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship."
The options of status quo ante or the appellant and children being  able  to
live in the UK

95. However, even if we were to proceed on  the  basis  that  the  only  two
viable options open to the appellant and her family are the status quo  ante
(i.e. for them to continue to live as  they  are  presently,  the  wife  and
children in Sri Lanka and the husband living in the UK) or for  them  to  be
able to live together in the UK, we would still not allow this appeal.

The best interests of the children

96. It is well-established that the best interests of the  child  assessment
requires a balanced approach: see e.g. Zoumbas at [13].

97. We shall first  identify  factors  in  favour  of  the  children's  best
interests being considered  to  repose  in  living  in  the  UK  with  their
parents. As already indicated, we are prepared to accept  for  the  purposes
of this appeal that it is now the parents' strong intent that  the  children
should resettle in the UK so they can  enjoy  the  rights  and  benefits  of
British citizenship, in particular the access to schooling here, which  they
consider superior to that the children currently enjoy in Sri Lanka. So  far
as we know of the children's own wishes, they are of the same mind as  their
parents, which means that they are likely to view  the  resettlement  as  an
opportunity rather than as a mere disruption. They want  to  settle  in  the
UK, which, as children possessing British citizenship, they are entitled  to
do as a matter of right.

98. As children with British citizenship, it is relevant  to  assessment  of
their best interests to take into account that moving to the UK  would  also
enable them to enjoy access to the UK the educational system and if need  be
to have free access to other services such as the NHS. Although we have  not
had country of origin evidence that might enable a full  assessment  of  the
comparative advantages and disadvantages of the rights and benefits  enjoyed
by children with Sri Lankan nationality in Sri Lanka as compared with  those
enjoyed by children with British citizenship in the  UK,  we  note  that  Mr
Lindsay did not dispute that those enjoyed in the UK  would  potentially  be
at a superior level. Being able to live in the UK from a young age  will  be
also likely to enhance their integration into UK society.

99. Leaving to one side here the option of their father moving to Sri  Lanka
to live with them there, the most obvious  impact  on  the  children's  best
interests currently is that they do not have a father in  their  life.  That
is not in their best interests. We noted earlier the  report  to  which  the
Supreme Court made reference in MM (Lebanon) identifying the  problems  that
can be attendant on separated family including adverse  behavioural  effects
on children: see above paragraph 61. Whilst we lack full evidence, we  think
it highly likely that the children's welfare is  diminished  by  not  having
their father living with them and that prolonged separation  of  the  family
will have negative effects on them. Their best interests are  to  live  with
both their parents. We come back to the issue of  country  of  location  and
likely duration of their separation below.

100.  We  next  consider  factors  weighing  against  the  children's   best
interests being assessed as requiring them to live  in  the  UK  with  their
parents. We note first of all  that  because  of  their  young  age,  it  is
reasonable to infer (in the absence of specific evidence  as  to  their  own
familial and social involvements) that their level of integration  into  Sri
Lankan society  is  very  much  a  function  of  their  mother's  degree  of
integration in her social and family environment, since a very  young  child
necessarily shares the social  and  family  environment  of  the  circle  of
people on whom he or she is dependent (as was noted by the Supreme Court  in
In the Matter of A (Children) (AP) [2013] UKSC 60, by reference to  Mercredi
v Chaffe (Case C-497/10 PPU) [2012] Fam 22 at [55] in the context  of  the
Hague Child Abduction Convention).  On the available evidence, although  the
appellant speaks good English, she  is  fully  integrated  into  Sri  Lankan
society; she has been educated there and studied  there  and  worked  there,
she has never lived outside it and all her  family  (bar  her  husband)  are
there.  The only notable difference in this respect between  the  children's
situation and that of their mother is that they are  attending  an  English-
speaking school  which  means  they  are  receiving  an  English  education,
whereas hers was a Sri Lankan education.

101. Obviously the children are receiving primary care  from  their  mother;
that distinguishes them from children who, for example, might be orphans  or
in institutional care.

102. It is not submitted on behalf of the appellant that  her  children  are
currently in poor or compelling circumstances. With the help of  money  sent
by the sponsor, they are able to live in Sri Lanka and  attend  an  English-
speaking school to advance their education.  Separately from the  appellant,
they have grandparents in Sri Lanka and it was indeed  they  with  whom  the
appellant previously intended to leave the children so  she  could  come  to
the UK and work (it is said, however, that they are now  old  and  fragile).
Remaining in contact with their extended family in Sri Lanka, such as  their
grandparents would be in the best interests of the  children.   Clearly  the
children have links of language, culture and residence with Sri  Lanka.  The
sponsor described them as bilingual. At most  their  linguistic  links  with
Sri Lanka might be somewhat diminished (because they are being  schooled  in
English). Given their young age, we doubt that  they  have  any  close  ties
with friends of unusual significance; certainly none of this type have  been
put forward as part of the evidence. They have no known health issues.

103. Reverting to the issue of the relevance of the children's  nationality,
whilst they are British citizens, they are also nationals of Sri  Lanka.  As
noted earlier, dual nationals ordinarily  stand  to  enjoy  the  rights  and
benefits of both countries of nationality, even though for children not  all
such rights and benefits have application. Here (again) we  have  incomplete
evidence, but it has not been submitted that the children do not  enjoy  the
rights and benefits that go with Sri  Lankan  nationality;  the  appellant's
submissions have only argued that such rights  and  benefits  are  inferior.
Given however, that it has not been submitted that the children are in  poor
or compelling circumstances, we consider the evidence to  show  that  whilst
refusal to their mother of entry clearance does deny  them  the  opportunity
to  exercise  almost  all  the  rights  and  benefits   of   their   British
citizenship, it does not mean that  they  lack  the  ability  to  enjoy  the
rights and benefits of Sri Lankan nationality. They are thus in a  different
position (at least at  the  abstract  level)  from  a  child  living  in  an
overseas country who has no nationality other than British.

104. Whilst the effect of the refusal decision on the  appellant's  children
is to deprive them of the opportunity to enjoy the rights  and  benefits  of
British citizenship that flow  from  residence  in  the  UK,  we  take  into
account that such deprivation is time-bound, since once they  turn  18  they
will be entitled to move to and reside in the UK as they choose.

105.  Weighing  up  all  relevant  considerations,  we  consider  that   the
children's best interests are for them to live with both their  parents  and
it has not been shown that it would significantly impair their  welfare/best
interests if their father went to live with them in Sri Lanka


The appellant's position under the Rules

106. Considering first of all the position of the appellant  under  Appendix
FM  and  FM-SE,  it  is  clear  that she  cannot satisfy  the  financial
requirements of the Rules.


107.  As  already  noted,  by  virtue  of  GEN.3.1-GEN.3.3  there   may   be
exceptional circumstances which could render refusal of  entry  clearance  a
breach  of  Article  8  because  it  could  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
consequences. This is the broadly  the  same question  that  arises  under
assessment of Article 8 at large, to which we now turn.


The wider proportionality assessment


108. Turning to the wider proportionality assessment, we have already  noted
the basic principles to be applied in Article 8  jurisprudence  as  set  out
in Boultif, Uner and Ahmut v Netherlands: see above paragraphs 65-71.


109. We have already considered  the  best  interests  of  the  children  at
paragraphs 96-105. Whilst we concluded that  their  best  interests  lie  in
living  with  both  their  parents,  we  have  not   found   their   current
circumstances to be such that they lack the ability to enjoy the rights and
benefits of  Sri  Lankan  nationality  and  we  have  noted  that  they  are
receiving good education in an English-speaking  school.  It  may  well  be,
comparatively speaking, that such rights and benefits are inferior to  those
they would likely be able to enjoy in the UK but it is  not  the  case  they
are living in poor circumstances. The  principal  detriment  to  their  best
interests currently is that they have no father in their lives,  apart  from
contact via FaceTime.


110.   The  sponsor's  reluctance  to  go  to  live  in  Sri  Lanka,  whilst
understandable, is nevertheless problematic  in  terms  of  Article  8:  see
paragraphs 91-94.  On the facts, it amounts to  an  attempt  to  compel  the
United Kingdom  to  give  effect  to  his  and  the  appellant's  choice  of
residence, despite the fact they cannot meet the requirements of the  Rules.
The sponsor's employment prospects in Sri Lanka may not be  as  good  as  in
the United Kingdom; but we are not satisfied that he has shown he  would  be
permanently unable to secure employment there in any reasonable capacity.


111. We lack full information, but it would appear that  the  appellant  and
the sponsor have been seeking to obtain entry clearance  from  as  early  as
2011-2012. Whatever the earlier reasons for  them  being  refused,  we  know
from the decision under appeal that they have narrowed down  essentially  to
two: that she  does  not  meet  the  MIR  and  because  refusing  her  entry
clearance would not result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  contrary  to
Article 8.  On  the  other  hand  (as  noted  earlier),  on  the  available
evidence, although she speaks good English, she  is  fully  integrated  into
Sri Lankan society; she has  been  educated  there  and  studied  there  and
worked there, she has never lived outside it and all  her  family  (bar  her
husband) are there. Further, although it would appear the couple  have  been
trying to obtain entry clearance for some time, we also know  that  in  June
2017 it was the appellant's intention to leave the  children  in  Sri  Lanka
with her parents. In any event, the appellant  has  been  employed  in  Sri
Lanka as a nurse and is reasonably likely to find similar  employment  again
when she chooses and the evidence does not show that  the  overall  position
of the family, if reunited in Sri Lanka, would be such as  to  preclude  the
respondent from pointing to that as  a  legally  acceptable  option.  We  so
find, both as to whether there would  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
sponsor returning  and  more  generally,  in  assessing  proportionality  as
required by Agyarko.
112. We have taken account of Mr Lewis's submission that the  job  offer  to
the appellant from a care home in the United Kingdom means  that  we  should
adopt the course described by  Lady  Hale  at  [99]  of  MM  and  judge  for
ourselves the reliability of that alternative source of finance.
113. The starting point for doing so  is  articulated  in  GEN  3.1  (1)  of
Appendix FM. This describes the circumstances in  which  the  decision-maker
must consider whether the financial requirement  in  paragraph  E-ECP.  3.1-
that is not met from the specified sources in the relevant paragraph  -  may
be met "through  taking  into  account  the  sources  of  income,  financial
support or funds set out in paragraph 21A(2) of Appendix FM-SE  (subject  to
the considerations in sub-paragraphs (3) to (8)  of  that  paragraph)".  The
circumstances in question are where "it  is  evident  from  the  information
provided by the applicant that there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which
could render refusal of entry clearance  ...  a  breach  of  Article  8  ...
because such refusal could result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for
the applicant, their partner or a relevant child" (GEN 3.1 (1)(b)).
114. Paragraph 21A(2) of Appendix FM-SE specifies the following as a  source
of income:
      "(b) credible prospective earnings from the sustainable employment ...
      of the
      applicant or their partner".
115. For the reasons we have given, on the evidence before us we have  found
that  the  appellant  has  not  been  able  to  show  that  there  are  such
exceptional circumstances, which could render  refusal  of  entry  clearance
unjustifiably harsh for the appellant, the sponsor or the  children.  Whilst
the sponsor has had mental health difficulties, the evidence does  not  show
that they are such that he would be  unable  to  secure  employment  in  Sri
Lanka; or to look after the children there, if the appellant were  again  to
go out to work.
116. In any event, even if it were necessary to examine the evidence of  the
job  offer  to  the  appellant,  that  evidence  falls  short  of  what   is
contemplated by paragraph 21A(8)(b) of Appendix FM-SE. The written offer  of
employment has not been "witnessed  or  otherwise  independently  verified";
nor is there a "signed or draft contract of employment".
117. If the evidence were to change, so as to  bring  the  case  within  GEN
3.1(1), then the appellant may decide to make a fresh application  based  on
the job offer (or some other offer),  addressing  the  matters  set  out  in
paragraph  21A(8).  Alternatively,  the  sponsor  may,  of  course,   secure
employment that meets the substantive requirements of the rules.
118. In the context of arguing that s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act (and  EX.1  of
the Rules) should be seen as reflecting  a  broader  legislative  policy  to
attach substantial weight to the British citizenship of children,  Mr  Lewis
pointed to the seeming anomaly that if the appellant  had  sought  to  enter
the UK illegally or unlawfully she would have  then  been  able  to  benefit
from s.117B(6). That would  appear  to  overstate  the  case,  since  in  KO
(Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 the Supreme Court, whilst ruling that the issue  of
whether it would be reasonable for a child to leave the UK did  not  involve
an assessment of the  public  interest,  concluded  nevertheless  that  "the
record of the parents may become indirectly  material..."  ([18])  and  that
"reasonableness had to  be  considered  in  the  real  world  in  which  the
children find themselves" ([19]. It cannot be assumed, therefore,  that  had
the appellant come to the UK and acted outside the  law  that  in  light  of
that  record  she  would  automatically  have  been  able  to  benefit  from
s.117B(6). In any event, as explained earlier,  the  current  state  of  the
legislation is that no analogous provision is made in law or policy for  the
parent of a British citizen child where both live abroad.

Zambrano

119. Although we have identified above that  British  citizenship  presently
confers an additional right of Union citizenship and that  in  the  Zambrano
line of cases applicants have sought to derive a right of residence  from  a
child who is a national of the Member  State  concerned,  we  conclude  that
this is not an issue arising  in  this  case.  The  appellant  has  made  no
application under the  EEA  Regulations  and  no  Zambrano  point  has  been
advanced before us.

120. Even if we were wrong in considering there is no  live  Zambrano  issue
before us, we do not consider it  would  avail  the  appellant  for  several
reasons.

121. First, even though article 20 TFEU would appear to cover the  right  of
admission as one aspect of the right of residence, the  Court's  concern  in
Zambrano and related cases has been solely with the issue of deprivation  of
the genuine enjoyment of the  substance  of  the  rights  attaching  to  the
substance of European Union  citizens  of  children  residing  in  a  Member
State. The threshold set is a  high  one,  namely  whether,  (paragraph  44)
because of the denial of that right, such children "would have to leave  the
territory of the European Union in order to accompany their  parents."  The
Court did not address what equivalent threshold would apply in an  admission
case, nor so far as we are aware has it in  any  Zambrano-type  case  since.
What  if  any  would  be  the  threshold  regarded  as  appropriate  in   an
admission/entry clearance context is at this stage moot.

122. Second, if there was considered to be some equivalent threshold  to  be
applied in admission/entry clearance cases, it is  important  to  note  that
the threshold applied in-country does not protect  against  inferior  socio-
economic benefits. As  the  Supreme  Court  emphasised  in HC,  R  (on  the
application of) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  [2017]  UKSC  73
at [9], "[t]here was no issue as to the  nature  of  financial  support  (if
any) required, nor as to the extent  of  any  right  to  benefits  otherwise
available to nationals."  Lord  Carnwath  (Lords  Clarke,  Wilson,  Sumption
agreeing)  cited  the  CJEU  ruling  in  Dereci  v   Bundesministerium   f�r
Inneres (Case C-256/11) [2012] 1 CMLR 45 at paragraph 68:

    "68. Consequently, the mere fact that it might appear desirable  to  a
    national of a member state, for economic reasons or in  order  to  keep
    his family together in the territory of the Union, for the  members  of
    his family who do not have the nationality of a member state to be able
    to reside with him in the territory of the Union, is not sufficient  in
    itself to support the view that the Union citizen will  be  forced  to
    leave Union territory if such a right is not granted."


123. At [47] of HC, Lady  Hale  likewise  observed  that:  "[t]he  situation
of Zambrano carers and their children does not fall  within  the  European
Union legislation on access to social security and other  welfare  benefits.
All that Zambrano requires  is  that  the  children  are  not  effectively
deprived of their rights as European citizens  by  the  situation  in  which
they find themselves."

124. Third, we  do  not  read  the  Zambrano  jurisprudence  to  warrant  an
automatic approach. In Chavez-Vilchez and Others v Raad van Bestuur  van  de
Sociale Verbekeringsbank and Others (10 May 2017)  (Case  C-133/15)  (Grand
Chamber), [2017] 3 WLR 1326, [2017] 3 CMLR 35 the CJEU ruled at  paragraphs
70 and 71 that:


    "70. In this case, in order to assess the risk that a particular child,
    who is a Union citizen, might be compelled to leave  the  territory  of
    the European Union and thereby be deprived of the genuine enjoyment  of
    the substance of the rights conferred on him by Article 20 TFEU if the
    child's third-country national parent were to be  refused  a  right  of
    residence in the Member State concerned, it is important to  determine,
    in each case at issue in the main  proceedings,  which  parent  is  the
    primary carer of the child and whether there is in fact a  relationship
    of dependency between the child and the third-country national  parent.
    As part of that assessment, the competent authorities must take account
    of the right to respect for family life, as stated in Article 7 of the
    Charter of Fundamental Rights  of  the  European  Union,  that  article
    requiring to be read in conjunction with the obligation  to  take  into
    consideration  the  best  interests  of  the   child,   recognised   in
    Article 24(2) of that charter.


    71. For the purposes of such an assessment, the fact  that  the  other
    parent, a Union citizen, is actually able and willing  to  assume  sole
    responsibility for the primary  day-to-day  care  of  the  child  is  a
    relevant factor, but it is not in itself  a  sufficient  ground  for  a
    conclusion that there is not, between the third-country national parent
    and the child, such a relationship of dependency that the  child  would
    be compelled to leave the territory of the European Union if a right of
    residence were refused to that third-country national. In reaching such
    a conclusion, account must be taken, in the best interests of the child
    concerned, of all the specific circumstances, including the age of  the
    child, the child's physical and emotional development,  the  extent  of
    his emotional ties both to the Union citizen parent and to  the  third-
    country national parent, and the risks which separation from the latter
    might entail for that child's equilibrium."

125. The role of the Zambrano principle in relation  to  children  who  have
citizenship of the Union was  considered  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  Patel
(Appellant) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (Respondent)
Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) v  Shah  (Appellant)
[2019] UKSC 59. Their  decision  confirms  that  the  "compelled  to  leave"
threshold is  a  high  one.  In  the  appellant's  case,  even  assuming  an
equivalency of threshold in entry  clearance  cases,  that  threshold  would
plainly not be met given the situation of the two British  citizen  children
in the appellant's case. Her children have strong emotional ties to  her  as
their primary carer and it has not been shown that  it  would  significantly
impair their welfare/best interests if their father went to live  with  them
in Sri Lanka.
126. Nor in the wider proportionality  assessment  have  we  been  satisfied
that either the status quo ante or the option open to the sponsor of  living
in Sri Lanka gives rise to a breach of Article 8.
127. We are mindful when reaching the above conclusion that  in  MA  and  SM
(Zambrano: EU children outside EU) Iran [2013] UKUT 380 the  Upper  Tribunal
held that:

    "(1)   In  EU  law  terms  there  is  no  reason  why  the   decision
    in Zambrano could not in principle be relied upon by the  parent,  or
    other primary carer, of a minor EU national living outside  the  EU  as
    long as it is the  intention  of  the  parent,  or  primary  carer,  to
    accompany the EU national child to his/her country of  nationality,  in
    the  instant  appeals  that  being  the  United  Kingdom.  To  conclude
    otherwise would deny access, without justification, to a whole class of
    EU citizens  to  rights  they  are  entitled  to  by  virtue  of  their
    citizenship."

128. However, we do  not  understand  by  so  holding  that  the  panel  was
suggesting that there was an automatic basis  established  by  Zambrano  for
parents of British citizen children living abroad to be  admitted  under  EU
law. To the contrary, the first appellant in the above case was  an  Iranian
national living in Turkey with AP, her British citizen child.  Although  the
panel in this case considered her case did fall  within  the  ambit  of  the
Zambrano principle, it was allowed because  it  was  the  current  intention
that the child abroad would travel to  and  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom
"even if his mother is not granted leave to do  so."  (para  53)  and  also,
because of the "exceptional nature of  the  situation  in  which  the  child
would find himself if his parent was denied entry into the  UK"  (para  51).
The second appeal, which also featured one of two British  citizen  children
living abroad, was not allowed.

129. To conclude:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  judge  has  already  been  set
    aside for material error of law.


    The decision we re-make is to dismiss the appellant's appeal.
