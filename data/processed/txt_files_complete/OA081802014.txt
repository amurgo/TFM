Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Although anonymity was granted in my earlier decision, the  appeals  of  the
minor Appellants have been allowed and only the  Second  Appellant's  appeal
remains.  He is not a minor child  and  there  is  no  reason  therefore  to
continue the anonymity order.


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

Procedural Background

    1. This is the third time that this  appeal  comes  before  me.   By  a
       decision promulgated on 17 March 2017, I allowed the appeals of this
       Appellant's mother and siblings against  the  Respondent's  decision
       dated 16 December 2014 refusing them entry clearance to  join  their
       husband/father, Mr Shah, who is a British citizen. That decision  is
       annexed to this decision for  ease  of  reference.  The  Appellant's
       mother and siblings have since entered the UK.


    2. By that decision, I directed that the appeal should remain  in  this
       Tribunal for re-making.  However, I was unable to  proceed  directly
       with the re-making of the decision because a dispute arose as to the
       relevant date for my consideration of Article 8 ECHR ("Article  8").
       Ms Rahman for the Appellant submitted that it was as at the date  of
       the hearing before me.  Mr Mills for the Respondent submitted that I
       could only consider circumstances as they existed at the date of the
       Respondent's  decision  under  appeal.  I  therefore  directed  that
       written submissions be made on that issue which I would determine in
       writing.


    3. By her written submissions, Ms Rahman conceded that  I  should  deal
       with Article 8 as if the matter were before me at the  date  of  the
       decision of the Respondent rather than as at the date of hearing.  I
       emphasise that this is an appeal which  proceeds  under  the  regime
       prior to the  amendments  made  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014  and
       therefore, as I determined on 8 June 2017, sections 85  and  85A  of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("the  2002  Act")
       operate to prevent me dealing with circumstances which  arise  after
       the Respondent's decision.  I will say a little more about that when
       I turn to consider the legal background below. My decision  on  this
       issue dated 8 June 2017 is also annexed to this decision.


The Evidence


    4. In reaching my decision I have had regard to a volume of documentary
       evidence before me consisting of the following:-


               . A bundle of documents submitted by the  Appellants  to  the
                 First-tier Tribunal (pages 1-342 -  referred  to  as  "AB/"
                 below)
               . A  supplementary  bundle  of  documents  submitted  by  the
                 Appellants to the First-tier Tribunal (pages 1-49)
               . A supplementary  bundle  of  documents  submitted  to  this
                 Tribunal including witness statements of the Appellant, his
                 father, mother and the elder of his two sisters


    5. In addition to  the  usual  Home  Office  bundle,  I  received  some
       additional documents from the Home  Office  consisting  of  the  CID
       records relating to the Appellant's father's entry into the  UK  and
       documents relating to an earlier appeal in relation to the Appellant
       and his sisters in 2011.


    6. I also heard oral evidence from the Appellant's father,  his  mother
       and the elder of his two sisters.


    7. I confirm that I have read and taken account of  all  the  evidence,
       both documentary and oral.  However, I  refer  below  only  to  that
       evidence which is pertinent to the issues which I have to determine.




The Factual Background


    8. The underlying facts in this case as they emerge from  the  evidence
       are as follows.  The Appellant and his family are all  nationals  of
       Pakistan.  In addition to his two sisters who, as I have noted,  are
       now in the UK, he has an elder brother, Musarat,  who  continues  to
       live in Pakistan with his own family, albeit in  a  different  area.
       The Appellant's uncles also live in the same area as Musarat. I  was
       told that this  was  an  area  about  one  hundred  miles  from  the
       Appellant's family home which is in Rawalpindi.


    9. The date of the Respondent's initial decisions in this case  was  22
       May 2014 but there was, at  the  time,  a  right  of  administrative
       review which the Appellant and his family exercised and the decision
       was upheld on 16 December 2014.  Both parties accept  that  this  is
       the relevant date for  the  purposes  of  my  consideration  of  the
       relevant circumstances.  The Appellant was born  on  13  June  1992.
       Therefore, at the date of  the  decision,  he  was  aged  twenty-two
       years.  His two sisters, who I refer to as TZ and AB were born on  4
       September 1997 and 3 December 2002.  They were accordingly,  at  the
       date of decision, aged seventeen and twelve years respectively.


   10. It is necessary to go back to the very beginning to  understand  the
       immigration history of this family.  The father of  the  family  and
       the sponsor in this case ("the Sponsor"), came to the UK in  October
       2003.  I heard oral evidence from the Sponsor about this.   He  came
       as the spouse of his second wife who I understand  was  British  and
       who he married in Pakistan in 2002.  At the time that he  came,  his
       first wife, the Appellant's mother, was pregnant with AB. It  is  of
       course permissible in Pakistani culture for a man to have more  than
       one wife and I simply note this as part of the factual background.


   11. The Sponsor told me that in 2006/2007, his second wife left him.  By
       that time, he had indefinite leave to remain. He  has  two  children
       from that marriage but he does not know  the  whereabouts  of  those
       children or his second wife.  He has no contact with them.


   12. The Sponsor decided not to return to Pakistan at that time or to try
       to bring his first family here to join him.  His  reasons  were  not
       entirely clear.  He suggested that he did not need them  because  he
       had his other family but when pressed about this, since the question
       related to the period after that marriage breakdown, he said  simply
       that he was trying to settle his life in this country.  He  obtained
       British citizenship in 2009.


   13. In 2010, an earlier application for entry clearance for  his  family
       was refused.  Mr Mills  produced  the  documents  relating  to  that
       refusal and appeal in evidence and the Sponsor was  asked  questions
       about them.  I deal with his evidence in this regard  when  reaching
       my decision below.  I here record what the documents  show  was  the
       evidence at that time.


   14. The application was made for the Appellant and his two sisters.  The
       application did not include their mother.  They applied to  come  to
       the UK as dependent relatives.  It was said that  their  mother  was
       physically unable to look after them and that their father  was  the
       only relative capable of providing for  their  care.   The  relevant
       decision of the Respondent at that time was dated  7  December  2010
       and the appeal was determined on 5 September 2011 (wrongly dated  as
       5 August 2011) following a hearing on 22 August  2011.   It  is  not
       entirely clear whether the Judge hearing that appeal was determining
       the issue as at December 2010 or August 2011 but since that is  only
       a matter of months, little turns on it.


   15. The evidence at that time was that the Appellant was  aged  eighteen
       or over (he would have been eighteen or  nineteen  at  the  relevant
       dates).  It was said that Musarat, then aged  over  twenty-one,  was
       living independently but was making "all the decisions now  and  the
       Sponsor phones him every day to give advice."   It was  there  noted
       that Musarat had been caring for the Appellant and his siblings  for
       some months and had "assumed responsibility for their  welfare"  but
       had relocated for work (although that was somewhat  contradicted  by
       evidence that Musarat was in full-time education).  It was also said
       that Musarat was living with the Sponsor's brother "some  3-4  miles
       away from the Appellant's" and that the Sponsor's  brother  was  now
       working in Dubai.


   16. The Judge did not accept that the Appellant's mother was so ill that
       she could  not  care  for  the  children.   The  Sponsor  was  found
       therefore not to have sole responsibility on  the  basis  that  "the
       Sponsor shares responsibility for his children with his wife, eldest
       son and his uncle".  By "eldest son", it is clear that the Judge  is
       referring to Musarat.  It was also found that "the  Appellants  live
       together with their mother and in close  contact  with  their  elder
       brother and uncle".


   17. Turning then to the family's  living  conditions  in  Pakistan,  the
       family, prior to the Appellant's mother and  sisters  relocating  to
       the UK, lived in a house owned by the Appellant's  father  although,
       it appears, transferred into the name  of  the  Appellant's  mother.
       The Sponsor gave evidence that he continues to own  this  house  and
       that, whilst he would sell it if the  Appellant  were  permitted  to
       come to the UK, he would not sell it if  and  so  long  as  it  were
       needed by the Appellant.


   18. The Sponsor has also transferred to the Appellant a parcel of  land.
       There was a good deal of confusion in oral evidence about  the  land
       transfers. The property which the Sponsor  has  transferred  to  the
       Appellant is a plot of land and not a house.  The document  in  that
       regard appears at [AB/302].  Although the sale deed refers  to  that
       as "rural", the Sponsor told me in oral evidence that the land is in
       a city and that it is sufficient for the building of a  house.   The
       property comprised in the sale deed at  [AB/312]  is  the  house  in
       which the Appellant currently lives which, as appears from the deed,
       was transferred to  the  Appellant's  mother.   Again,  though,  the
       Sponsor confirmed, in relation to the plot of land that  whilst,  if
       the Appellant is permitted to come to the UK, they would  sell  that
       plot of land, the plot of land  remains  in  the  ownership  of  the
       Appellant and would not be sold if he was unable to come here.


   19. The Appellant is well-educated.  Although  not  dealt  with  in  the
       witness statements, I was told in oral evidence (and as is confirmed
       by the evidence in the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  which  I  set
       aside), the  Appellant  has  a  Master  of  Business  Administration
       degree.  I am told that he also has a Bachelors degree.  The Sponsor
       also confirmed that, since the date of  the  Respondent's  decision,
       the Appellant had managed to secure one job, as I understood it,  in
       the IT industry but gave it up because it meant  living  apart  from
       his family. For the sake of completeness on this issue, I note  that
       I was provided with evidence that, at the time of the appeal  before
       the First-tier Tribunal, the Appellant had the offer of a  part-time
       job dealing with administration and  accounting  for  a  company  in
       Birmingham for a salary of �12,500.


   20. Finally, I deal with one additional factual aspect  which  has  some
       bearing  on  the  Appellant's  situation,  namely  the  position  in
       relation to Musarat who, as I  have  noted,  continues  to  live  in
       Pakistan.  There is  no  mention  of  him  in  any  of  the  witness
       statements prepared  for  this  hearing  and  a  marked  reluctance,
       particularly on the part of the Appellant's mother, to discuss  him.
       However, from a piecing together of the evidence which I did receive
       and the benefit of Mr Mills' submissions which admittedly  contained
       a number of assumptions but which were not rebutted  by  Ms  Rahman,
       the position appears to be as follows.


   21. Musarat was born in 1989.  According to the Appellant's mother,  the
       family moved to Rawalpindi about twenty to  twenty-four  years  ago.
       The Appellant's sisters were born there.   However,  she  said  that
       Musarat did not like Rawalpindi and so returned to  his  home  area.
       As I have noted, there was a marked reluctance to put a date on when
       that occurred.  However, following protracted cross-examination, she
       settled on an answer that he had moved after he left college.   That
       coupled with her assertion that Musarat  was  not  educated  led  Mr
       Mills to suggest that Musarat left Rawalpindi when he was aged about
       eighteen ie in about 2007. That appeared  to  be  confirmed  by  the
       evidence of ZT. The Appellant's mother did however admit the Musarat
       continued to visit them thereafter about once or  twice  per  month.
       The Sponsor said that the Appellant and Musarat do not have a  close
       relationship although little detail was provided about that.


    Relevant legal provisions


   22. The only issue  before  me  is  whether  the  Respondent's  decision
       breaches Article 8.  In my decision promulgated on 17 March 2017,  I
       preserved the findings in [19] of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision
       which was  not  challenged  by  the  Appellant.   For  the  sake  of
       completeness, I set out that paragraph and adopt the findings  there
       made:


            "[19]      Turning  to  the  application  made  by  the  second
           appellant. His application for entry clearance as  a  child  was
           refused because he was 21 at the time the application  was  made
           and 22 when it was finally decided thereby failing to  meet  the
           requirement that  he  was  aged  under  18  at  the  time.   His
           application was then considered as an adult  dependent  relative
           since it was accepted that he was dependent  upon  the  sponsor.
           But that part  of  the  immigration  rules  only  permits  entry
           clearance under that category for those who need help with  long
           term personal care of the basis of age, illness  or  disability.
           The sponsor has confirmed that the second appellant is  in  good
           health,  having  just   finished   his   Masters   in   Business
           Administration and waiting to come to the UK with his mother and
           siblings where he has a job waiting for him.   He  clearly  then
           falls out-with the dependent relative rule and his  application,
           I find was correctly refused."


       The legal position is therefore that the Appellant does not meet the
       Immigration Rules ("the Rules")  for  entry  as  the  child  of  the
       Sponsor.  He is not under eighteen years and his  circumstances  are
       not such that he can qualify as a dependent relative.


   23. As I note at [3] above, it is now accepted by both parties that  the
       relevant date for assessment whether there is a breach of Article  8
       is based on  circumstances  as  at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
       decision in December 2014.  I raised an issue in my decision dated 8
       June 2017 whether that excluded consideration of the  separation  of
       the Appellant from the rest of his family.  As I noted at  [11]  and
       [12] of that decision, that is a slightly more nuanced question.  At
       the date of the Respondent's decision, the circumstances  were  that
       none of the family would be permitted to enter.  I have since  found
       that the decision was not in accordance with the law as regards  the
       Appellant's mother and  sisters.  I  envisaged  therefore  that  the
       Respondent's position might have  been,  as  it  is  in  some  entry
       clearance  cases  where  circumstances  have  moved  on,  that   the
       Appellant would need to make another application for entry clearance
       based on the changed circumstances.  As it was,  Mr  Mills  did  not
       submit that this was the position.  He agreed with Ms Rahman that  I
       must consider Article 8 on the hypothetical  assumption  that,  when
       the Respondent refused the Appellant's application, the rest of  the
       family's applications were granted and  therefore  that  the  family
       would be separated.
   24. This issue is touched upon in  PT (Sri Lanka  )  v  Entry  Clearance
       Officer, Chennai [2016] EWCA Civ 612 - "PT (Sri Lanka)") at [37]  as
       follows:-


            "[37]      I return to the question of the date as at which the
           proportionality of the refusal of  entry  clearance  had  to  be
           assessed.  Mr Waheed did not in fact seek  permission  to  amend
           his grounds of appeal to  rely  on  the  error  by  the  FTT  in
           assessing proportionality as at the date of his decision  rather
           than the ECO's, though he did in the course of  his  reply  make
           some reference to it.   I  should  be  reluctant  to  allow  the
           Appellant to rely on a point taken for the first time  in  reply
           in this Court.  But I do not in fact believe that  it  has  been
           established that the error was material on this  aspect  of  the
           case.  If the Judge had focused on the evidence relating to  the
           position as at the date of the ECO's decision he would have  had
           to consider the impact of the Appellant of having to live on his
           own on a prospective basis rather  than  on  the  basis  of  how
           things had turned out; but the difference between the two  dates
           was only some nine months, and there is  no  reason  to  suppose
           that his assessment would in fact have been different."


   25. PT (Sri Lanka) concerns a factually similar situation;  that  was  a
       case in which the Respondent had  granted  entry  clearance  to  the
       remainder of the family.  Although the point was not the subject  of
       full argument in that case, it is implicit in  what  is  there  said
       that the Court of Appeal considered it may well be  legally  correct
       to make the assumption that the other applications would succeed (as
       in fact they did in that case) when dealing with the refusal of  one
       of the family's applications.  Both parties in this case are  agreed
       that I must consider Article 8 on the basis of the family separation
       on the hypothesis of this being the position  at  the  date  of  the
       Respondent's  decision  and  I  have  therefore  heard  no  contrary
       argument about this.  I therefore proceed on the basis that this  is
       correct.  My own view, in any event, is that it probably is  legally
       correct because I found that the Respondent's decisions in  relation
       to the rest of the family were not in accordance with the law.  That
       was the position at the date of those decisions, albeit  shown  only
       by evidence which was not before the  Respondent  (but  relating  to
       circumstances which did exist at that time).  It follows that, as  a
       matter of law, the Respondent should have decided  the  applications
       of the rest of the family differently and should have granted  those
       applications.  If that had been the position at the time, it follows
       that the Respondent would be obliged to consider  Article  8  as  at
       that date on the factual basis that the Appellant would be separated
       from the rest of his family.


   26. I turn to one final issue on this aspect, namely whether I can  take
       into account developments  relating  to  the  Appellant's  situation
       since the date of the Respondent's decision.  To  an  extent,  I  am
       bound to do so since the rest of his family came to the UK  only  in
       May 2017.  Ms  Rahman  objected  however  to  Mr  Mills'  submission
       relating to, for example, the fact that the Appellant has been  able
       to find work in Pakistan albeit a job which he then gave up.  In  my
       view, I can take such evidence into account.  Indeed, the  Appellant
       has included in his evidence a job offer made to him for work in the
       UK which post-dates the Respondent's decision.
   27. There is bound to be a degree of speculation involved in any Article
       8 assessment about what the future might bring.  In this case,  that
       is accentuated by having  to  look  backwards  to  the  hypothetical
       position in December 2014.  That  means  that  I  must  assume,  for
       example, that both the  Appellant's  sisters  remain  children  even
       though one is now aged over eighteen.  It does  not  mean,  however,
       that I need exclude from consideration what the position might  have
       been, looking to the future, if, in December 2014,  the  Appellant's
       family were in the UK and he was not.  At that  date,  as  Mr  Mills
       pointed out, the Appellant was on the verge of  completing  his  MBA
       and it might therefore reasonably be assumed that he would  then  be
       looking for work.  All that the evidence since shows is  speculation
       that he would be likely to find work, whether in Pakistan or the UK,
       is not unfounded.


   28. With that somewhat lengthy preamble, I turn then to the legal  issue
       which it is for me  to  determine.   I  start  by  noting  that  the
       Respondent accepts that there is family life between  the  Appellant
       and his family in the UK.  In entry  clearance  cases,  as  relevant
       case law shows, that is not always the position where  an  appellant
       is a adult. As Mr Mills pointed out, however, the Appellant had  not
       at the  relevant  date  formed  an  independent  family  life.   The
       evidence is that he lived with his family,  even  when  studying  at
       university, and had not formed his own family.


   29. I do  not  therefore  need  to  deal  in  detail  with  Ms  Rahman's
       submissions on the case-law so far as those focussed on this aspect.
        Although she sought to persuade me that the factual position in  at
       least one of those cases (Rai v Entry Clearance Officer,  New  Delhi
       [2017] EWCA Civ 320) was so similar to this case that  I  needed  to
       have regard to it, I do not accept that submission.   It  is  rarely
       the position that the facts of one case can simply be transposed  to
       another as consideration of that case makes clear (it  involved  the
       additional facet of the historical background and subsequent  policy
       treatment of Gurkhas).


   30. Nor does the Respondent dispute that there is a sufficiently serious
       interference with family life brought about by the separation.  Both
       the first and second "Razgar" questions are therefore decided in the
       Appellant's favour.   Although  I  understood  one  of  Ms  Rahman's
       submissions to be that the only consideration thereafter is  whether
       the decision is in accordance with  the  law  because  there  is  no
       public interest in  play,  she  confirmed  that  this  was  not  her
       intention.  There is no suggestion  that  the  decision  is  not  in
       accordance  with  the  law  and  therefore  the  case  turns  on   a
       proportionality assessment.  The public interest in this case is the
       maintenance of immigration control.  It is accepted by the Appellant
       that he does not meet the Rules to enter as his  father's  dependent
       relative (or in any other category). The issue is therefore  whether
       the interference with his family life (and that of  his  family)  is
       outweighed by that public interest.


   31. The Respondent concedes as she must that the case does not just turn
       on the Appellant's family life but also that  of  his  other  family
       members.  Based on the relevant date of December 2014, two of  those
       family members - the Appellants' sisters - were children.    Section
       55 is therefore of relevance.  Ms Rahman referred me to what is said
       at [39(iv)] of Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v  SS
       (Congo) and others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 ("the fact that the interests
       of a child are in issue will be a countervailing factor which  tends
       to reduce to some degree the width of  the  margin  of  appreciation
       which the state authorities would otherwise enjoy..").


   32. In terms of the public interest, as the Supreme Court succinctly put
       the issue at [68] of MM (Lebanon) and others v  Secretary  of  State
       for the  Home  Department  [2017]  UKSC   10  ("MM  (Lebanon)"),  "a
       decision in accordance with the rules will not involve a  breach  of
       article 8 save in "exceptional circumstances"; which  expression  is
       equated  with  circumstances  where  a   refusal   would   lead   to
       "unjustifiably harsh"  consequences  for  the  individual  or  their
       family".  As that judgment also makes clear, significant  weight  is
       to be accorded to the best interests of any children  involved  and,
       as  is  now  trite  law,  those  best  interests   are   a   primary
       consideration although not necessarily paramount or decisive.


   33. One factor on which the parties were disagreed is the effect of  the
       element of choice by the family.  This  too  is  considered  by  the
       Court of Appeal in PT (Sri Lanka) at [36] as follows:-


            "[36]      Ms McGahey relied also on the point made by  the  UT
           that the immediate reason why the family life in Sri Lanka broke
           up was that the Appellant's mother and sisters chose  to  go  to
           the UK to join the father;  or,  to  look  at  it  another  way,
           because the father did not choose to come back to live with them
           all in Sri Lanka - it must be recalled that he was not a refugee
           and so did not face persecution if he  returned.   She  did  not
           suggest that that meant that the  difference  in  the  decisions
           taken in the Appellant's  case  and  those  of  his  mother  and
           sisters did not constitute an  interference  with  family  life.
           But  she  said  that  it  was  relevant  to  the  assessment  of
           proportionality.  Although this was not a point on which the FTT
           relied I  agree  that  it  is  a  material  consideration.   The
           Respondent's decision gave the family a hard choice; but it  was
           nevertheless a genuine choice."


       Mr Mills, unsurprisingly, relied on this passage.


   34. In response, Ms Rahman  referred  me  to  what  is  said  about  the
       importance of British citizenship in MM (Lebanon) at [104]:-


           "[104]. Taking the factors listed in Jeunesse: family life would
           effectively be seriously ruptured, because they could spend only
           short periods of time together; while  both  spouses  originated
           from the DRC, the sponsor has been here for many years  and  was
           naturalised as a citizen here as long ago as 2006; he  also  has
           two children who are both British citizens, so his ties to  this
           country are extensive; the First-tier Tribunal  has  found  what
           are insurmountable obstacles in the way of their living in  DRC;
           there are no factors of  immigration  control  or  public  order
           weighing in favour of exclusion. The only  factor  pointing  the
           other way is the fact that this is a "post-flight" relationship,
           formed when there was no guarantee that the applicant  would  be
           admitted, although it  began  in  2010  before  the  Rules  were
           changed, and the sponsor would easily have met the old "adequate
           maintenance" test."

   35. It is to be noted, however, that the case there under  consideration
       involved not simply a British sponsor but also two British children.
        As the Court in ZH (Tanzania) made clear, the  British  citizenship
       of a child is a particularly important factor  because,  of  course,
       the  child  has  no  independent  say  in  the  exercise   of   that
       citizenship; that is influenced by the decisions made by the child's
       parents.  Conversely, the Supreme  Court  in  Agyarko  and  Ikuga  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11, expressly
       accepted that, even in  the  case  of  a  relationship  involving  a
       British citizen spouse, the Respondent is not obliged to permit  the
       non-British national partner to remain (and by extension  to  enter)
       if the couple cannot meet the Immigration Rules.


   36. Bringing together the above principles, the legal position is  that,
       where the Rules are not met by the relationship under consideration,
       a refusal of leave to enter or remain is only disproportionate where
       there are compelling  circumstances  such  that  the  effect  on  an
       appellant or others affected by the decision would be unduly  harsh.




    Decision and reasons


   37. I start with the best interests of the two children involved in this
       case.  Before I turn to the evidence I  have  received  about  them,
       however, it is necessary for me to deal with the  position  of  this
       family in Pakistan before the Appellant's mother  and  sisters  came
       here.


   38. Although, as I have noted, there was a marked reluctance to  mention
       in evidence Musarat, the Appellant's elder brother, the evidence  as
       a whole shows that he was living with the family for at  least  some
       of the time since the Sponsor came to the UK.  I cannot  ignore  the
       evidence given in the 2011 appeal that he was the  one  then  caring
       for the family, albeit not living  with  them  at  that  time.   The
       Sponsor said that Musarat had lived separately from the family since
       2009/2010 which is slightly later than was  suggested  by  his  wife
       (insofar as  she  was  willing  to  answer  the  question  at  all).
       However, it is clear from the documents in the earlier  appeal  that
       Musarat was involved with care of the family at least until the date
       of  that  earlier  appeal  and  possibly  later.  That  is  probably
       unsurprising given that the Appellant was at that time still a child
       himself (he turned eighteen in June 2010).


   39. In his  answers  under  cross-examination,  the  Sponsor  sought  to
       downplay the role which Musarat played by stating that  it  was  not
       really Musarat who was looking after the family in 2010/11  but  his
       brother who thereafter left for Dubai.  That is however contradicted
       by the evidence which he gave in 2011 that it was Musarat  with  his
       (the Sponsor's) daily input who was looking after the family because
       his brother had by then left for Dubai.


   40. The impression which the Sponsor and his wife were keen to  give  in
       evidence however was that it was the  Appellant  who  paid  all  the
       bills, looked after his mother and sisters and made  the  decisions.
       That may have been the case between 2010  and  2014  but  I  do  not
       accept that it was the case before 2010.  The Sponsor left  Pakistan
       in 2003.  Musarat was then aged  about  fourteen.   The  Appellant's
       mother said that the family moved to  Rawalpindi  and  that  Musarat
       moved with them albeit reluctantly.  It appears from what  was  said
       in 2011 that the Sponsor's brother then lived in Rawalpindi,  a  few
       miles from the family house.  The evidence is that this brother  was
       looking after the family until he left for  Dubai.   Thereafter,  it
       appears, Musarat took up the reins until at least 2010.


   41. This is relevant to my assessment in this case because  Ms  Rahman's
       closing submission  is  that  the  younger  sisters  had  formed  an
       emotional dependency on the Appellant because they grew up  with  no
       father present.  The suggestion  is  that  the  Appellant  became  a
       father figure for the two younger girls. It will  be  observed  from
       the factual background above that ZT was aged about six  years  when
       her father left and AB was not even born.  The Appellant was himself
       aged only eleven years.  I cannot for that  reason  accept  what  is
       said in ZT's evidence that the Appellant has  "always  looked  after
       us".  He may well have done so for several years (and of  course  ZT
       will be looking at the period up to when they left Pakistan and  not
       on the basis of some  hypothetical  prior  date).   However,  it  is
       stretching the evidence  too  far  to  suggest  that  the  Appellant
       effectively became the "man of the house" in 2003 and became a  sort
       of father figure to the two girls from that date.


   42. I do accept ZT's evidence that she and AB had a closer  relationship
       with the Appellant than they did with Musarat.  Musarat is  quite  a
       lot older than them both and it is to  be  expected  therefore  that
       their relationship would be closer to the sibling who was closer  in
       age to them.  The Appellant is,  as  she  explained,  not  just  her
       brother but her friend.  They  went  everywhere  together.  Further,
       Musarat, at least at some point before 2010, appears to  have  taken
       over caring for the family and had therefore  taken  over  from  his
       father.  One might therefore expect that they might not view him  in
       the same way as a sibling.


   43. ZT is clearly very distressed about  separation  from  her  brother.
       She told me that she could not imagine  living  without  him.   That
       position would be worse for her sister, AB, who grew  up  without  a
       father in her daily life and treated the Appellant like a father  as
       well as a brother.  ZT's evidence was  heartfelt  and  her  emotions
       were (as Mr Mills described them) "raw".  That  is  to  be  expected
       since, at the date of the hearing before me,  the  family  had  only
       been separated for a couple of months.


   44. ZT was asked about her relationship with Musarat.  She said that she
       lived with him until he was about eighteen (i.e. at least four years
       after her father left).  She admitted that she missed  him  when  he
       left home and that she had got used to it.  She  emphasised  however
       that her relationship with Musarat was not as close and  was  of  an
       entirely different nature to that  with  the  Appellant.   She  also
       noted that because she was young (on her evidence about  ten  years)
       when he left, she had not felt it as much but she now understood and
       felt very bad for her brother (the Appellant) left behind on his own
       in Pakistan.


   45. Some of ZT's concerns though appeared to be focussed more on her and
       her sister's situation than on that of the Appellant. She was  asked
       by Ms Rahman to tell me how she felt about the Respondent's position
       that, as the Appellant is (or was at the relevant time) aged twenty-
       two, he could look after himself.  She replied:-


           "If he would have gone way then what would have happened  to  us
           and our mother?  Mum is ill.  He was the responsible one.  If he
           wasn't there how would we survive?"


       It  might  be  suggested  that  this  shows  a  higher  than  normal
       dependency of the sisters on their  brother  than  would  be  usual.
       However, that takes no account of the fact that the  two  girls  are
       now in the UK with their father who might be expected to resume  the
       role of carer for the two girls.


   46. Similarly, when asked about what difference it made to  their  daily
       lives that the Appellant is  not  here,  ZT  said  "He  used  to  do
       everything for us.  We don't know how to move around in society.  We
       have not been into practical life at all.  It  is  very  difficult".
       Again, that might suggest a stronger than usual family life based on
       the family dynamics at play here.  However, the Appellant  would  be
       in no better position than his sisters to integrate into UK society.
        He has never lived here.  It is their  father  who  has  lived  and
       settled in the UK.  It is to him that the Appellant's  sisters  will
       need to turn in order to find their way here.


   47. I accept that both ZT and AB (from whom I did not hear  due  to  her
       age) would very much prefer the Appellant to be in the UK with them.
        However, the question whether it is in their best  interests  is  a
       slightly  different  one.   Section   55   requires   me   to   give
       consideration to the promotion and safeguarding  of  their  welfare.
       True it is that their emotional welfare, certainly  at  the  current
       time, would be better served by having their brother in the UK  with
       them because they are upset by the separation.  However, I find that
       this is only marginally so and whilst they suffer the evident  sense
       of  loss  which  is  to  be  expected  from  such  a  recent  family
       separation.


   48. In the longer term, these  are  two  teenage  girls  who  have  been
       brought to a strange country when they have been used  only  to  the
       culture of Pakistan.  They will inevitably need support to integrate
       here and that is  the  more  important  point  for  their  emotional
       welfare.  That can only be provided by their father who is the  only
       person with sufficient experience of the culture.  They have not had
       that father in their life for many years (at least not on a  regular
       basis) and it is to be expected that a period will be  required  for
       them to adjust to having both parents in their  lives.   Ultimately,
       though, they are now living with both parents which is generally  in
       the best interests of a child of their age.  ZT is of course now  no
       longer under eighteen and therefore not strictly a child.   However,
       I have to proceed on the basis that she is and in any event,  it  is
       clear that she has not formed any independent life  of  her  own  to
       date.


   49. I start my assessment of Article 8 therefore on the basis  that  the
       best interests of the Appellant's two sisters  marginally  favour  a
       result in the Appellant's favour.


   50. I turn then to consider the situation of the Appellant's mother  and
       father.  I can deal with their position  shortly.   His  father  was
       willing to leave his family in Pakistan in 2003 to come to  the  UK.
       He has visited the family once or twice per year since.  That was  a
       matter of choice for him.  I do not criticise his  choices  but  the
       family life which he has formed with his son is inevitably deserving
       of less weight than would be the case if he had lived with him as he
       was  growing  up.   Similarly,  although  the   Appellant's   mother
       obviously misses the Appellant, her evidence was largely directed at
       his relationship with his sisters rather than with her.  She  talked
       of them crying as they left their brother at the airport.   Although
       she said that she was ill and could  not  look  after  the  children
       properly, I have received no medical evidence as to  her  conditions
       or why she could not look after them, particularly  since  they  are
       now of an age where they may be expected to form their own lives and
       look after themselves (save for AB). It was her  and  the  Sponsor's
       choice for the family to relocate to the UK, even  after  they  were
       aware that their departure would inevitably lead to separation  from
       the Appellant, even if she hoped that might be temporary.


   51. I turn then to consider the position of the person  who  is  at  the
       heart of this appeal - the Appellant.  He was aged twenty-two  years
       at the relevant date.  He is now  twenty-five.   Unfortunately,  the
       drafter of the statements prepared for this appeal has drafted  them
       in a largely common format  which  does  not  convey  the  emotional
       impact on the Appellant of separation from his family.   I  did  not
       hear from the Appellant in the same way as I  did  from  his  family
       members; I was not asked to.


   52. I did however, receive oral evidence from his mother and ZT which  I
       take into account.  I accept therefore that he is very upset by  the
       separation.  I accept that he  has  always  lived  with  his  family
       (apart, it seems, from a short period when he moved  away  for  work
       but quickly gave that up because he did not  wish  to  live  on  his
       own).  I accept that he misses them very much.  I also accept though
       Mr Mills' submission that the separation is very recent and that  is
       therefore to be  expected.   Although  ZT  said  that  she  (and  by
       implication the Appellant) would never get over being  apart,  I  do
       not accept that evidence any more than I accept  her  evidence  that
       she  cannot  live  without  him.   Those  are   the   understandably
       emotionally charged statements of a  young  teenager  faced  with  a
       separation which she did not want and which she did not choose.


   53. Turning then to the position in which the  Appellant  is  living  in
       Pakistan, the circumstances  cannot  be  described  as  particularly
       compelling.  He has a roof over his head.  The Sponsor has confirmed
       that he will not sell the house for as long as the Appellant  wishes
       to live there.  The Sponsor has supported the family financially  in
       the past and there is evidence that he will continue to do  so.   He
       has transferred a plot of land to the Appellant  which  he  says  is
       sufficient for the building of a house if the Appellant wishes to do
       that.  The Sponsor said that he transferred the land to his  son  as
       an investment for his future and therefore the  Appellant  could  no
       doubt use that if he needed to.  Further,  the  Appellant  is  well-
       educated  and  has  already  had   one   job   offer.    Given   his
       qualifications, it may reasonably be expected that he  could  obtain
       another.


   54. I accept the evidence  that  I  heard  that  the  Appellant  is  not
       particularly close to Musarat who also lives at some  distance  from
       the Appellant. Musarat is about four years older than the  Appellant
       and left home aged eighteen and has formed his own independent life.
        However, the fact remains that the Appellant does  have  family  in
       Pakistan in the form of his elder brother and two uncles who live in
       the same area as Musarat.


   55. There is also nothing to prevent the Appellant's family returning to
       Pakistan to visit him.  Indeed, as I note at [59] below, the  family
       could, if they chose to do so, return to Pakistan  to  live.   There
       are no very significant problems standing in their  way.   It  is  a
       matter of their choice.  Although Mr Mills accepted that there might
       be some obstacles in the way of the Appellant visiting his family in
       the UK (given the failed applications  for  settlement  which  might
       cause an entry clearance officer to question the motives behind  the
       visit), the Appellant's Article 8 rights would need to be considered
       in any such decision and it may well be therefore that he  would  be
       permitted to visit.  Further, as  I  noted  in  the  course  of  the
       hearing, his educational achievements may  be  such  that  he  could
       either come to the UK to study or work in his own right.  I  do  not
       speculate but there clearly are provisions in the Rules which  might
       be open to the Appellant.  The evidence before me is also  that  the
       family are maintaining almost daily contact by "Skype" and the like.
        I completely accept that such contact at distance is not  the  same
       as daily contact in person.  It does however mean that there  is  no
       "rupture" of family ties as is suggested in MM (Lebanon) might exist
       in some cases (see [34] above).


   56. Of course, ideally, the Appellant would like to come to the UK.  The
       fact remains though that he does not meet the Immigration Rules as a
       relative of the Sponsor.  I am mandated by Section 117B of the  2002
       Act to have regard to the fact that the maintenance  of  immigration
       control is in the public interest.  That means that if an  applicant
       cannot meet the Rules, the public interest in general will  outweigh
       that person's Article 8 rights because it is the Rules which set out
       the Respondent's view of where the boundaries of  migration  control
       should lie.  Although it might appear to the Appellants  that  there
       is no reason of wider public interest  why  they  should  be  denied
       having a member of their family join them here, if all families  who
       migrated to the UK were permitted to bring any  family  member  they
       chose to bring, there would undoubtedly be an impact  on  migration.
       The Rules are intended to control  migration  such  that,  whilst  a
       partner or minor children can be expected to be allowed to enter  to
       join a father settled in this country (if they can  meet  the  other
       requirements of the Rules), the same is not true of a child who  has
       become an adult or other adult family members.  The question whether
       the Rules are met is therefore a very  important  consideration.  As
       the Supreme Court succinctly put it in MM (Lebanon) if a person does
       not meet the Rules it is only in compelling circumstances  that  the
       public interest will be outweighed by a person's  Article  8  rights
       and that will be only where the result will be unduly harsh for  the
       applicant or those affected by the decision.


   57. In relation to the  other  provisions  in  Section  117B,  Mr  Mills
       confirmed that none are at issue.  I do not  have  evidence  whether
       the Appellant speaks English but ZT spoke English  well  and  I  was
       told that the siblings were educated in English.  No issue was taken
       about the Sponsor's ability to provide the additional  income  which
       would be needed to support the Appellant in addition to the rest  of
       the  family.   They  are  therefore  assumed   to   be   financially
       independent.


   58. In this case, I  have  found  that  the  Appellant's  sisters'  best
       interests are marginally favoured by the Appellant being in the  UK.
       That is though only marginal for  the  reasons  I  have  given.   In
       particular, I do not accept that the separation of  the  Appellant's
       sisters from him is unduly harsh for them for  the  reasons  I  have
       given.  They are understandably upset to  be  separated  from  their
       brother with whom they have a close relationship.   They  have  been
       brought to a strange country of which they have no prior  experience
       and have not yet had the chance to make friends.   They  are  though
       living with both their parents who can no doubt be expected to  care
       for their welfare and support them through this transition.


   59. I have already dealt with the situation of the Appellant's  parents.
       In addition, it is a relevant  factor  that  they  could  choose  to
       return to Pakistan to be with the Appellant if they wished to do so.
        The Sponsor said that this would be "very hard" for him because  he
       is settled in the UK, and is working.  He is also a British citizen.
        Those might be reasons why he does not wish to return but they  are
       not reasons why he could not do so.  He has property in Pakistan. It
       is not said that he could not find work there.   In addition to  the
       Appellant, he has other family members in Pakistan,  namely  another
       son and brothers.


   60. I appreciate that the separation will be  hardest  of  all  for  the
       Appellant.  As ZT herself put it, "at least we are together.  He  is
       alone".   However,  although  he  is  undoubtedly  very  emotionally
       attached to his mother and sisters and therefore very upset  by  the
       separation, I do not accept on the facts  here  that  separation  is
       unduly harsh for the reasons I have already given. He has a home  in
       Pakistan.  The Sponsor confirms that he will  continue  to  maintain
       that home for as long as the Appellant needs  it  and  continues  to
       provide financial support to his  son  from  the  UK.  There  is  no
       suggestion that this will cease. He can  continue  to  maintain  his
       family ties at a distance and by visits.

   61. Weighing the impact of the separation of the Appellant from the rest
       of his family against the public interest in migration control,  for
       those reasons, I am satisfied that the refusal of entry clearance is
       not a breach of Article 8 ECHR and I dismiss the appeal.

Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Although anonymity was not granted by the First-tier Tribunal,  one  of  the
Appellants remains a minor child.   It  is  therefore  appropriate  that  an
anonymity order be made.  Unless and  until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs
otherwise,  the  Appellants  are  granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify  them  or  any  member  of
their family. This direction applies both  to  the  Appellants  and  to  the
Respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt  of
court proceedings.


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

Background

   62. The Appellants appeal against  a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
       Judge  Hawden-Beal  promulgated  on  6  May  2016  ("the  Decision")
       dismissing their  appeals  against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
       decisions dated 16 December 2014 refusing them  entry  clearance  as
       the spouse and children of the Sponsor, Mr Shah, who  is  a  British
       citizen.  The First Appellant is  Mr  Shah's  spouse.   The  Second,
       Third and Fourth Appellants are their children born on 13 June 1992,
       4 September 1997 and 3 December 2002.  Only two of the children  are
       therefore still  under  the  age  of  eighteen  although  the  Third
       Appellant was also a minor at the date of application  on  10  April
       2014.  That is relevant when I turn to disposal of their  individual
       appeals.


   63. The Respondent refused the applications on the basis  that  Mr  Shah
       could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration
       Rules ("the Rules") to show that he had the requisite income to meet
       the threshold requirements in the Rules.  An  additional  point  was
       taken in relation to the validity of the First  Appellant's  English
       language certificate.  The Second Appellant who  could  not  qualify
       for entry under Appendix FM as Mr Shah's child due to  his  age  was
       refused because he could not meet the Rules  in  relation  to  adult
       dependent relatives.


   64. The refusal based on the evidence of income depended in part  on  Mr
       Shah's failure to provide two payslips for part of the period during
       the six months prior to the application. By the date of hearing,  Mr
       Shah had provided  those  payslips.  The  Judge  accepted  that  the
       evidence showed that he could therefore meet the requirement to earn
       more than �24,800 which was the requisite figure for maintenance  of
       the First, Third and Fourth Appellants.  She  also  found  that  the
       Respondent  had  not  proved  that  the  First  Appellant's  English
       language certificate was valid.  However, the Judge found  that  she
       was not entitled to take into account the payslips  which  pre-dated
       the application but were not provided with it.  She therefore  found
       that the First, Third and Fourth Appellants could not succeed  under
       the Rules. The Judge also found  against  the  Appellants  in  their
       claim that the Respondent's decisions breached Article 8 ECHR  ([22]
       and [23] of the Decision).  She found against the  Second  Appellant
       also on the basis that he could not meet the Rules  in  relation  to
       adult dependent relatives ([19]).


   65. The first to third of the Appellants' grounds focus on  the  Judge's
       refusal to take into account the additional  payslips.   The  fourth
       ground concerns Article 8 ECHR. Permission was granted by First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Shimmin on both aspects of the grounds.   The  matter
       comes before me to decide whether the Decision contains  a  material
       error of law and, if so,  to  re-make  the  Decision  or  remit  the
       appeals for rehearing to the First-Tier Tribunal.

    Appeals of the First, Third and Fourth Appellants


   66. The main issue  in  relation  to  these  Appellants  is  the  income
       threshold requirement as if the Judge were wrong not  to  take  into
       account the payslips,  then  they  could  succeed  under  the  Rules
       (subject to the  English  language  certificate  finding  not  being
       challenged by the Respondent).


   67. In her Rule 24 response, the Respondent stated as follows:-
            "[2].      The  respondent  does  not  oppose  the  appellant's
           application for permission to appeal and invites the Tribunal to
           determine the appeal with a fresh  oral  (continuance)  hearing.
           It is quite clear the evidence would  have  been  admissible  as
           long as it appertained  to  the  relevant  date  of  application
           pursuant to Section 85 and S85A of the 2002 Act."
       No challenge was  made  to  the  finding  on  the  English  language
           certificate.


   68. These appeals pre-date the coming  into  force  of  the  changes  to
       appeal  provisions  brought  about  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014.
       Section 85 and 85A Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
       ("the 2002 Act") therefore read as follows (so far as relevant):-
            "Section 85
            ...
            (4) On an appeal under section 82(1)...against a  decision  the
           Tribunal may consider evidence about any matter which it  thinks
           relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  evidence
           which concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision.
            (5) But subsection (4) is subject to the exceptions in  section
       85A"


            "Section 85A
           1) This section sets out the  exceptions  mentioned  in  section
              85(5)
           2) Exception 1 is that in relation to an  appeal  under  section
              82(1) against an immigration decision of a kind specified  in
              section 82(2)(b) or (c) the Tribunal may  consider  only  the
              circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision."


   69. The Respondent concedes (rightly) that this restriction relates only
       to  the  "circumstances"  and  not  to   the   evidence   of   those
       circumstances.  The Judge accordingly made an error in finding  that
       she could not take into account the payslips which Mr Shah submitted
       showing his income in January  2014  and,  most  importantly,  March
       2014. The  Appellants'  ground  two  is  therefore  made  out.   The
       Appellants' ground one is also legally correct but I do not need  to
       deal with that or ground three which  relates  to  the  Respondent's
       discretion to seek out documents not provided with the application.


   70. Based on the Respondent's concession, Mr Mills agreed that,  if  the
       evidence contained in the March 2014 pay slip showed  that  Mr  Shah
       was in receipt of more than �24,800 per annum, the  appeals  of  the
       First, Third and Fourth Appellants should be allowed  on  the  basis
       that the Respondent's decisions were  not  in  accordance  with  the
       Rules.  The payslip dated March 2014 as well as Mr  Shah's  P60  for
       that year show that his income for  the  year  was  �26,070.21.  The
       application  for  entry  clearance  was  made  on  10  April   2014.
       Accordingly, I allow the appeals of  the  First,  Third  and  Fourth
       Appellants on that basis.


    Appeal of the Second Appellant


   71. The position of the Second Appellant is however different because he
       was not a minor child at the date of the application.   Accordingly,
       he cannot succeed under Appendix FM in the same way.   There  is  no
       challenge in the Appellants' grounds to the Judge's finding that  he
       could not meet the Rules relating to adult dependent relatives.  His
       challenge to the Decision  is  therefore  confined  to  ground  four
       relating to the assessment of Article 8 ECHR.


   72. I pointed out to Ms Rahman at the hearing that, read  strictly,  her
       ground  four  ([50]  of  the  grounds)  refers  only  to  the  First
       Appellant.  She submitted however that it should not be read in that
       way.  The reference to the  First  Appellant  only  relates  to  the
       Judge's assessment at [22] of the Decision.  She confirmed that  all
       four  appeals  were  argued  on  the  basis  that  the  Respondent's
       decisions were disproportionate.  As such, she asked me to read that
       ground as  relating  to  all  four  Appellants  (although  only  now
       relevant to the Second  Appellant  because  the  other  appeals  are
       allowed under the Rules).


   73. Mr Mills did not disagree with  Ms  Rahman's  submission.   He  also
       conceded  that  the  Judge's  assessment  of  Article  8  ECHR   was
       necessarily  infected  by  the  error  made  in  relation   to   her
       consideration of the Rules as the Judge assumed  that  none  of  the
       Appellants could satisfy the Rules whereas I  have  found  that  the
       majority of the family can.


   74. Submissions therefore proceeded on the basis that I  should  re-make
       the Decision in relation to the Second Appellant's appeal  on  human
       rights grounds.  Ms  Rahman  submitted  that,  although  the  Second
       Appellant is now aged twenty-four, he has always formed part of  the
       family unit and has  not  formed  his  own  independent  life.   She
       submitted therefore that, since  the  other  Appellants  are  to  be
       permitted entry, his  appeal  should  be  allowed  on  human  rights
       grounds.  She directed my attention to evidence before the Judge  as
       to the Second Appellant's position as follows:-
               . Mr Shah's statement ([AB/5-8] at [21] and [23])
               . Mr Shah's oral evidence as set out at [9] of the Decision
               .  The  decision  of   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge   Thomas
                 promulgated on 5 August 2011 in an  earlier  appeal  which,
                 whilst dismissing the  appeals  of  the  Second  to  Fourth
                 Appellants in these cases, found  that  the  family  has  a
                 close relationship
               . Mr Shah's letter in support of the Appellants' applications
                 dated 19 February 2014 ([RB/56-57])
       She also made submissions as to the  relevant  law  particularly  in
       relation to the recent Supreme Court judgment in  MM  (Lebanon)  and
       others v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]  UKSC10
       ([39] to [44] of the judgment).


   75. I do not deal at this stage with the substance of those  submissions
       because in the course of our discussions about  what  directions  if
       any were required for the Appellants to adduce further  evidence,  a
       dispute arose as to  the  relevant  date  for  my  consideration  of
       Article 8 - whether should  be  at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
       decision or at the date of the hearing before me.


   76. Mr Mills referred me again to the terms of Section 85A of  the  2002
       Act and submitted that this restriction applies just as much to  the
       consideration of human rights as to the application  of  the  Rules.
       Ms Rahman indicated that she had not foreseen this dispute  arising.
       It was not prefaced in the Rule 24 statement although, in  fairness,
       as I have already  indicated,  the  Appellants'  fourth  ground  was
       itself shortly stated and far from clear.


   77. I therefore decided that the appropriate course was to  adjourn  the
       resumed hearing with directions  for  written  submissions  on  this
       question.  Once those are received,  I  will  then  make  a  further
       decision in writing on the papers on that issue and give  directions
       as to further evidence (if that appears necessary) before  re-making
       the Decision in relation to the Second Appellant.

      DECISION


    Appeals of First, Third and Fourth Appellants
    I am satisfied that the Decision contains a material error  of  law  in
    relation to these Appellants. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Hawden-Beal promulgated on 6 May 2016 is  set  aside.  I  substitute  a
    decision allowing the appeals of the First, Third and Fourth Appellants
    on the basis that the Respondent's decisions are not in accordance with
    the Rules.


    Appeal of Second Appellant: S Q A - OA/08180/2014
    I am satisfied that the Decision contains a material error  of  law  in
    relation to the Second Appellant's appeal on human rights  grounds.   I
    therefore set aside the Decision so far as concerns his  appeal  but  I
    preserve the findings at paragraph [19] of the Decision which  are  not
    challenged.


    The resumed hearing of his appeal to re-make the Decision is  adjourned
    with the following directions:-


    1) The Second Appellant shall file with the Tribunal and serve upon the
       Respondent within fourteen days from the date when this decision  is
       sent his submissions in relation to the point in time at  which  his
       Article 8 rights fall to be considered  by  this  Tribunal  and  the
       legal  basis  on  which  those  submissions   are   founded.   Those
       submissions should also set out the Second Appellant's  position  as
       to the evidence which the Tribunal may take into account in relation
       to this issue and what directions are sought in relation to the  re-
       making of the decision in his appeal.


    2) The Respondent shall file with  the  Tribunal  and  serve  upon  the
       Second Appellant within fourteen days from the date when the  Second
       Appellant's submissions as set out in  (1)  above  are  served,  her
       submissions on the same issues also setting out the legal  basis  on
       which those submissions are founded and  any  directions  sought  in
       relation to the re-making of the decision.


    3) Thereafter, the file shall be returned to me for a  decision  to  be
       made on the  papers  on  the  timing  issue  together  with  further
       directions as necessary for the re-making of the  decision  and  any
       resumed hearing.

Background

   78. By a decision promulgated on  17  March  2017  ("the  Decision"),  I
       allowed the appeals of this Appellant's mother and siblings  against
       the Respondent's decision dated 16 December 2014 refusing them entry
       clearance to join their husband/father, Mr Shah, who  is  a  British
       citizen.


   79. By the Decision, I also found an error of law  in  the  decision  of
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Hawden-Beal  promulgated  on  6  May  2016
       dismissing this Appellant's appeal.   I  directed  that  the  appeal
       should remain in this Tribunal for re-making. However, I was  unable
       to proceed directly with the re-making of the decision  because,  as
       appears from [14] and [15] of the Decision, a dispute  arose  as  to
       the relevant date for my consideration of Article 8 ECHR.  Ms Rahman
       for the Appellant appeared to submit that it was as at the  date  of
       the hearing before me.  Mr Mills for the Respondent submitted that I
       could only consider circumstances as they existed at the date of the
       Respondent's decision under appeal.


   80. I therefore gave directions for written submissions on this issue to
       be filed and served and I adjourned the appeal for re-making on  the
       basis that  I  would  provide  a  further  decision  on  this  issue
       following  consideration  on  the  papers  and  would  give  further
       directions thereafter for the re-making  of  the  decision  and  any
       resumed hearing.


   81. I have received submissions from Ms Rahman dated 27 March 2017  with
       relevant legal provisions  and  authorities.  I  have  not  received
       submissions from the Respondent and  the  deadline  for  filing  and
       serving those submissions has now passed.  It may be though that, in
       light of  Ms  Rahman's  submissions,  it  was  not  thought  by  the
       Respondent to be  necessary  to  make  submissions  since  the  core
       submission made by Mr Mills appears now to be accepted.


    The Appellant's Submissions


   82.  The Appellant accepts that his appeal  pre-dates  the  coming  into
       force of the Immigration Act 2014.  The appeal is therefore  brought
       pursuant to section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       2002 ("the 2002 Act") read with section 82(2)(b).


   83. By reason of sections 85 and 85A of the 2002 Act as those provisions
       stood prior to amendment, "in relation to an  appeal  under  section
       82(1) against an immigration decision of a kind specified in section
       82(2)(b)  ...the  Tribunal  may  consider  only  the   circumstances
       appertaining at the time of the decision.."


   84. It is therefore accepted by the Appellant that I can  consider  only
       those  circumstances  which  existed  when  the   Respondent   entry
       clearance officer made his or her decision.   The  Appellant  refers
       also to the House of  Lords'  judgment  in  AS  (Somalia)  (FC)  and
       another v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UKHL  32
       and SA (ambit of s.85(5) of 2002 Act) Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT  00018
       ("SA") which are to the effect  that,  even  in  relation  to  human
       rights, the Tribunal is not required to and indeed  cannot  (because
       of section 85A of the 2002 Act) consider events which post-date  the
       Respondent's decision.  That is not contrary to the duty  placed  on
       the Tribunal by the Human Rights Act  1998  because  Parliament  has
       specifically   circumscribed   the   limits   of   the    Tribunal's
       consideration.
   85. That is though not the end of the matter.  The Appellant  refers  to
       the decision of this Tribunal in DR  (ECO:  post-decision  evidence)
       Morocco [2005] UKIAT 00038 and submits based on the guidance in that
       case that the Tribunal  is  entitled  to  take  into  account  post-
       decision evidence which relates to circumstances as they existed  at
       the time of the Respondent's decision.  That  is  confirmed  by  the
       decision in SA.


   86. The submissions also refer at [18] and [19] of  the  submissions  to
       the best interests of the child.  This Appellant of  course  is  not
       and has not been at any relevant date a child.  I need not deal with
       those submissions at this stage  in  any  event;  whether  they  are
       relevant is a matter for me to consider when re-making the decision.
        Nor do I need to say anything about the lengthy  list  of  evidence
       which it is said I can take into  account.   I  will  consider  that
       evidence when coming to re-make the decision.


    Conclusions
   87. The Appellant now accepts that the relevant date  for  consideration
       of the Appellant's Article 8 case is the date  of  the  Respondent's
       decision.  He accepts that I cannot take into account  events  post-
       dating that decision.  I can though take into account evidence which
       relates to circumstances which were in existenace at that  date.   I
       can therefore take  into  account  the  extent  and  nature  of  the
       Appellant's family and private life as it existed at that date.


   88. There is a slightly more nuanced point about the extent to  which  I
       can take into account the separation of the  Second  Appellant  from
       the rest of his family when assessing the level of interference with
       the Appellant's family and private life and the  proportionality  of
       the  Respondent's  refusal  to  grant  him  entry  clearance.    The
       circumstances at the date of the Respondent's decision were that his
       mother and siblings were in Pakistan  and  their  applications  also
       were refused.  However, I have since  found  that  the  Respondent's
       decision in that latter regard was not in accordance with the Rules.




   89. This is not a point which is addressed in  the  Appellant's  written
       submissions.   I  have  not  received  any  submissions   from   the
       Respondent and so I do not  know  what  stance  she  takes  in  this
       regard. It is though a point which I do not  need  to  determine  at
       this juncture  as  the  Appellant  seeks  a  direction  that  he  be
       permitted to adduce further evidence prior to the re-making  of  the
       decision.  In those circumstances, I have made that direction and  I
       have also directed a further oral hearing prior to the re-making  of
       the decision.  This will enable the Appellant's sponsor  and  father
       to give oral evidence if he chooses to do  so  and  will  give  both
       parties the opportunity  to  make  oral  submissions  on  the  issue
       identified at [12] above (if necessary) and on the evidence which  I
       should take into account.





      DIRECTIONS


    1. The Appellant is  to  file  with  the  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
       Respondent within 28 days from the date when this decision  is  sent
       any further evidence on which he relies (which evidence  may  relate
       only to circumstances as they were at the date of  the  Respondent's
       decision).


    2. The appeal will be relisted before UTJ Smith in  Birmingham  on  the
       first available date thereafter for a resumed hearing  with  a  time
       estimate of three hours.
