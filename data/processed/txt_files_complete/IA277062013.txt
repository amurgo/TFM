Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr J Middleton, instructed by Magne & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, M A, date of birth 22.8.77, is a citizen of Zimbabwe.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Oliver promulgated 14.2.14, dismissing her appeal against the  decision
    of the Secretary of State, dated 19.6.13,  to  refuse  her  application
    made on 12.12.12 for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under the 10-year
    long-residence Rules. The Judge heard the appeal on 20.1.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pirotta  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.3.14. Similarly, Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein  refused  permission
    in the Upper Tribunal on 11.4.14. However, the matter went to the Court
    of Appeal and was remitted to the Upper Tribunal, whereupon  the  Vice-
    President granted  permission  to  appeal  on  21.4.15,  stating,  "The
    parties are reminded that the Upper Tribunal's task is that set out  in
    s.12 of the 2007 Act."

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 7.12.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Oliver should be  set  aside.  For
    the reasons set out below, I find that there is no  material  error  of
    law and that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  should  stand  as
    made.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant first came to the UK in 2001 as a visitor, with leave limited
    to 6 months. She was later granted  further  LTR  as  a  student  until
    30.8.02. An out of time application for further leave made on  27.12.03
    resulted in a grant of leave on 19.1.04, valid to 30.9.05.

 7. Thereafter, she was refused further leave to remain as  a  student  but
    her in time application was not refused until 8.12.05 and she  made  an
    in time appeal against that decision.  That  appeal  was  dismissed  on
    11.4.06 and from that date the appellant  as  Appeal  Rights  Exhausted
    (ARE). However, whilst her appeal was still  pending,  on  27.3.06  she
    made an application for an EEA Residence Card, granted on  12.7.07,  on
    the basis of a relationship  with  a  Norwegian  partner,  valid  until
    12.7.12. On that same date, she lodged an application for ILR under the
    10-year continuous  lawful  residence  provisions  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. This was refused on 19.6.13, on the basis that  there  were  two
    breaks in leave. The first between 31.8.03 and 18.1.04, and the  second
    between 1.10.05 and  11.7.07.  The  application  was  also  refused  on
    failure to submit evidence of family life  with  a  partner  or  child.
    Neither did she meet the requirements of paragraph 276 ADE  in  respect
    of private life. The Secretary of State considered that there  were  no
    exceptional (compelling) circumstances to  justify  granting  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR, and decided to
    remove the appellant pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.

 8. The grounds of appeal included the argument that at the time  she  made
    her application on 27.3.06 for an EEA Residence Card she had continuing
    leave by virtue of section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971, awaiting the
    outcome of her appeal against the decision made on 8.12.05 to refuse to
    grant further LTR as a student.

 9. �12 of Judge Oliver's decision purports to record a concession  by  the
    Home Office Presenting Officer that the second gap "was cited in  error
    in the refusal because the appellant had section 3C leave at the time."
    The Judge also concluded that the time the appellant spent in Zimbabwe,
    between July and December 2004, should be disregarded because  she  had
    leave both at the date of leaving and return and was for a period under
    6 months.

10. Judge Oliver concluded, however, that there remained two breaks in  the
    continuity of lawful residence. The  first  was  a  clear  gap  between
    1.9.03 and 18.1.04, when her student leave had expired and her  out  of
    time application was not granted until 19.1.04, a period in  excess  of
    28 days. The second was that commencing 12.7.07, when she  was  granted
    an EEA Residence Card as an extended family member.  Her  argument  was
    that in order to meet the 10-year continuity period she could aggregate
    her leave under the Immigration Rules from 2002, extended under section
    3C pending her appeal against the refusal decision of 8.12.05, together
    with the grant of the Residence Card on 12.7.07, in order to  meet  the
    long residence requirement.

11. Judge Oliver rejected this argument, noting that  her  application  was
    made under the Immigration Rules and not under the EEA Regulations, and
    concluded that she could not combine leave under one regime with  leave
    under another and thus her claim under the Rules fell to be dismissed.

12. For separate reasons, set out  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision,
    Judge Oliver noted that the appellant could not meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules in respect of private or family life and that removal  was
    proportionate to the appellant's human  rights.  Thus  the  appeal  was
    dismissed on all grounds.

13. The appellant sought to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, as set out in the
    chronology above. It appears that eventually the matter was remitted by
    the Court of Appeal, because the Upper Tribunal failed to grapple  with
    the point of principle isolated in �18(iv) of the  statement  of  facts
    before the Administrative Court,  namely,  the  submission  that,  "The
    legal issue on amalgamation of time for extended family  members  is  a
    novel and important question of law  that  the  UT  (IAC)  should  have
    considered. It raises an important  legal  issue  about  the  interplay
    between EU law and the UK's domestic rules. The  number  of  people  in
    similar circumstances, who might seek to combine time as a holder of an
    EEA residence document with time holding leave under the  Rules  in  an
    application for ILR under para. 276B is probably very large.  For  this
    reason too the claim should be permitted to proceed."

14. In submissions before me, Mr Middleton confined his  arguments  to  the
    novel point in relation to the interplay between the Rules and  section
    3C leave on the one hand and the grant of an EEA Residence Card on  the
    other. He made his submissions consistent with and following  his  very
    helpful skeleton argument, dated 8.6.15.

15. I accept Mr Middleton's submission that  the  first  gap,  between  the
    expiry of the appellant's leave on 30.8.03 and the grant  of  leave  on
    18.1.04 was not essential to the appellant's case at the  date  of  the
    hearing before the First  Tier  Tribunal.  Following  the  section  120
    notice  incorporated  into  the  refusal  decision,  the  Tribunal  was
    required to consider whether the appellant met  the  10  years'  lawful
    residence requirement at the date of the  appeal  hearing  of  20.1.14.
    Thus the necessary period the appellant had  to  demonstrate  was  from
    21.1.04 to 20.1.14. The  first  gap  identified  by  Judge  Oliver  was
    therefore not relevant.

16. However, for the  reasons  set  out  below,  I  reject  Mr  Middleton's
    submissions that the appellant can combine her  section  3C  leave  and
    what he insisted was the equivalent of 'leave'  under  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations.

17. Eligibility for ILR on the basis of the ten-year long  residence  route
    is set out at paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules,  which  requires
    the appellant to demonstrate  that  she  has  had  at  least  10  years
    "continuous lawful residence" in the UK,  disregarding  any  period  of
    overstaying of 28 days or less.

18. Paragraph 276A(a) provides that "continuous residence" means  residence
    in the UK for an unbroken period, and excludes absence for a period  of
    6 months or less, provided the applicant has existing limited leave  to
    enter or remain on both departure and return. Paragraph 276A(b) defines
    'lawful residence' as residence which is continuous residence  pursuant
    to: (i) existing leave to enter or remain; or (ii) temporary  admission
    (not relevant to this case); or (iii) and  exemption  from  immigration
    control, including  where  an  exemption  ceases  to  apply  if  it  is
    immediately followed by a grant  of  leave  to  enter  or  remain.  The
    appellant did not have any leave to remain in the UK after  the  expiry
    of leave.

19. Under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, as  amended,  on  12.7.07
    the appellant was granted  a  Residence  Card  as  an  extended  family
    member, as defined by regulation 8, which is at the discretion  of  the
    Secretary of State. This is not  the  grant  of  leave  and  cannot  be
    residence pursuant to paragraph 276A.

20. As part of his argument as set out in �28 of his skeleton  argument  Mr
    Middleton has referenced the IDI applicable at the date of issue of the
    Residence Card. This relates to long residence  applications  by  third
    country nationals who have spent part of their time in the  UK  as  the
    family member of an EEA  national  exercising  Treaty  rights.  "During
    their time here under  the  provisions  of  the  EEA  regulations,  the
    individuals would not have been  subject  to  immigration  control  and
    would not have required leave to enter or remain. Therefore, they would
    not fall within the definition of 'lawful residence' given at paragraph
    276A (my emphasis)." However IDI continues that as  family  members  of
    EEA nationals exercising their treaty rights to reside in  the  UK  are
    here in a lawful capacity then, "Provided they meet all  of  the  other
    requirements, discretion may be exercised to count this time as  if  it
    were lawful residence."

21. There was no evidence placed before  me  to  demonstrate  whether  this
    policy was still in force at the date of the refusal decision in 2014.

22. In any event, is quite clear,  and  Mr  Middleton  accepts,  that  this
    discretion is not provided for extended family members. I do not accept
    his  argument  that,  because  the  appellant's  application  was   not
    specifically rejected on the basis of a period of  residence  under  an
    EEA Residence Card, it was not open to the First-tier Tribunal Judge to
    dismiss the appeal on the basis that  the  period  of  time  relied  on
    included that under  a  Residence  Card.  As  Mr  Middleton  maintains,
    arising from the section 120 notice, the judge was required  to  assess
    whether the appellant met the long residence requirement as at the date
    of appeal hearing. It follows that the Tribunal is required to consider
    whether the appellant has had 10 years continuous lawful  residence  as
    at that date, by whatever means.

23. The remainder of Mr Middleton's submissions, from �31 onwards,  depends
    entirely on an interpretation of 'lawful residence' so  as  to  include
    time spent under an EEA Residence Card. He submits that the issue of  a
    Residence Card to an extended family member "is in substance a grant of
    leave to remain." I reject that submission noting,  as  the  IDI  cited
    above suggests, such time  is  not  'lawful  residence,'  otherwise  no
    discretion would be required for family members (as defined in the  EEA
    Regulations). The grant of an EEA Residence Card is not  the  grant  of
    leave to remain. It is no more than  the  recognition  of  an  existing
    status, the right to reside, with the Regulations giving effect to  the
    Citizens Directive. The issue of the  Residence  Card  does  not  grant
    anything at all that did  not  already  exist.  I  do  not  accept  the
    argument at �34 of the skeleton argument that because  the  regime  for
    issuing residence cards to extended family members is discretionary, or
    permissive, on  the  part  of  the  Secretary  of  State  following  an
    extensive examination of the personal circumstances of  the  applicant,
    it amounts to a grant of leave.

24. Mr Millington's secondary or alternative submission,  set  out  at  �35
    onwards of the skeleton argument, is that as  extended  family  members
    require the Secretary of State's permission to enter or reside  in  the
    UK that amounts to, is in substance, or is equivalent to the  grant  of
    leave to remain. I do not accept this argument, and do not accept  that
    "in substance" the issue of an EEA Residence Card is a grant  of  leave
    to remain. In R (Kungwengwe) v SSHD [2005] EWHC 1427 (Admin)  Wilkie  J
    held that residence of a spouse of an EEA  national  exercising  Treaty
    rights could not count as lawful residence for the purpose  of  the  10
    year long residence requirement under the Immigration Rules. It matters
    not that the refusal decision mistakenly referred to the grant of leave
    to remain on the issue of the EEA  Residence  Card  on  12.7.07.  I  am
    satisfied that in law the issue of an EEA Residence  Card  is  no  more
    than recognition of an existing right based on the relationship between
    the applicant and the EEA citizen exercising Treaty rights  in  the  UK
    and the regulations in that regard are intended to reflect the Citizens
    Directive.

25. I also note that if Mr  Millington's  argument  is  correct  it  would,
    ironically,  place  'extended  family  members'  in  a  stronger  legal
    position than 'family members' under the Regulations. The  IDI  directs
    attention to the exercise of a discretion in their case, but, as  cited
    above, makes clear that even family members  do  not  fall  within  the
    definition of 'lawful residence,' and  would  have  to  depend  on  the
    exercise of discretion.

26. I further note that the relationship on which the  Residence  Card  was
    issued to the appellant ended in 2010  and  thus  from  that  date  the
    appellant was no longer entitled to  Residence  under  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations,  regardless  as  to  when  the  Residence  Card  was
    expressed to expire. From 2010 she had no entitlement or  leave  remain
    or to reside in the UK, either on the basis of the Citizens  Directive,
    or the Immigration Rules. Further, the  EEA  Residence  Card  was  only
    issued in July 2007 and thus the appellant had not  completed  5  years
    residence and could not acquire any right to remain in the UK  on  that
    basis. It follows for this reason,  additionally,  that  the  appellant
    could not meet the 10-year lawful residence requirement, even if  I  am
    wrong in finding that the issue of an EEA Residence Card to an extended
    family member cannot count as lawful residence in calculation of the 10-
    year period required under the Immigration Rules.

27. The appellant became Appeal Rights Exhausted in  April  2006  when  her
    appeal against the decision of December 2005 in respect of her  student
    leave. She has had no lawful leave  to  remain  under  the  Immigration
    Rules since that date.

28. In the circumstances and for the several reasons set out above, I  find
    that the appellant does not meet the requirements of the 10  year  long
    residence grant of leave sought and thus Judge Oliver  was  correct  to
    dismiss the appeal on that basis.

29. For completion, I find no identifiable or material error of law in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds. I am satisfied that the judge properly  considered  the
    evidence  relating  to  private  and  family  life  and   reached   the
    conclusion, for which cogent reasons are set out in the decision,  that
    there  are  no  exceptional,  by  which  I  take  to  mean  compelling,
    circumstances justifying allowing the appeal outside the Rules  on  the
    basis of family or private life under article 8 ECHR, and that  in  any
    event the removal decision is entirely proportionate when balancing  on
    the one hand  the  rights  of  the  appellant  and  on  the  other  the
    legitimate and necessary aim and  public  interest  in  protecting  the
    economic well-being of the UK through  immigration  control.   If  that
    assessment were to be conducted today the Tribunal would have  to  have
    regard to the significant public  interest  considerations  of  section
    117B of the 2002, including that immigration control is in  the  public
    interest and that little weight should  be  given  to  a  private  life
    developed whilst the appellant's immigration status was  precarious  or
    unlawful, which I find it was for considerable periods, including after
    2005 and again after the termination in 2010  of  the  relationship  in
    respect of which she was granted an EEA Residence Card in 2007. In  all
    the circumstances of this case is abundantly clear that the appellant's
    private and family life claim was so weak that there was no prospect of
    success on this ground.

Conclusions:

30. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First Tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed both in the First-tier  Tribunal  and
in the Upper Tribunal.
