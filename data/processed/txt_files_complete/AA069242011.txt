                                   Before
                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE JORDAN

                                   Between

                               Folashade Taiwo
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               The Secretary Of State For The Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                      RULING AND NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT
                          pursuant to Rule 17A (2)
            of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008


   1. By letter dated 27 February 2014, Kesar & Co, solicitors, on behalf of
      the appellant, informed the Tribunal that the Secretary of  State  has
      recognised the appellant as a refugee and has  granted  her  leave  to
      remain in line with her refugee status.
   2. By operation of section 104 (4A) of the 2002 Act as substituted by the
      Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, an appeal under  section
      82 (1) brought by a person while he is in the United Kingdom shall  be
      treated as abandoned if the appellant is granted leave  to  remain  in
      the United Kingdom unless subsections (4B) or (4C) applies.
   3. Sub-section (4C), dealing with the Race Relations Act, does not apply.


   4. Having been recognised as a refugee,  sub-section  (4B)  cannot  apply
      because there can be no 'up-grade appeal' on asylum  grounds  and  the
      appellant will not be removed, thereby preventing a violation  of  his
      human rights.
   5. Section 104 operates as a statutory disposal of the appeal  which  the
      Tribunal has no power to prevent.
   6. Rule 17A (inserted from 15 February 2010) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  echoes  the  mandatory  effect  of  the
      statute:


           "(1) A party to an asylum  appeal...before  the  Upper  Tribunal
           must notify the Tribunal if they are aware that -
                 (b) the appellant has been granted leave...to remain in the
                 United Kingdom...
           (2) Where an appeal is treated as abandoned pursuant to  section
           104(4)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration   and   Asylum   Act,
           2002...the  Upper  Tribunal  must  send  the  parties  a  notice
           informing them that the appeal has been treated as abandoned  or
           finally determined."


   7. The hearing of the CMR on 18 March 2014 is vacated.
   8. The hearing of this appeal on 18, 20 and 21 March 2014 is vacated.


RULING

      The appellant's appeal is treated as abandoned.
