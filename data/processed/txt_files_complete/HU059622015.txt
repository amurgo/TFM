Representation:

For the appellant:           Mr Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the respondent:          Mr Z. Nasim, Counsel instructed by Legal
Rights Partnership


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity I will refer to the parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically the Entry Clearance
    Officer (ECO) is the appellant in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

2.    The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision to  refuse  a
    human rights claim within the  context  of  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse  made  on  14  May  2015.  The  ECO  refused  the
    application in a decision dated 12  August  2015  because  insufficient
    evidence was produced to meet the financial requirements.

3.     A  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  allowed  the  appeal  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 06 December 2016. She made the following findings:

       "8.  Mr Nazim's position was that the  Sponsor  was  not  a  salaried
                 employee and it was therefore  necessary  to  look  at  six
                 months' employment from November 2014  to  April  2015  and
                 that showed an income of �9490 for a six-month period.  The
                 situation is somewhat complicated as the  Sponsor  has  two
                 jobs and in respect of one of them there  as  a  change  of
                 accountant  so  that  there  are  wage  slips  from   three
                 different companies.
       9.   I am  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  produced  employers'
                 letters for a six-month period prior to  the  date  of  the
                 application in accordance with the rules because the letter
                 from  Carlton  Villages  Services  Ltd  does  not   provide
                 information about the sponsor's pay and her length of  time
                 with the company. That information was not provided until 7
                 September 2015. That information is however now  before  me
                 and it does show that the sponsor has been working for  the
                 same company, who used their accountants to deal  with  the
                 payroll, from October 2013 and that her  salary  from  that
                 business as of 7 September 2015 was �8566.68. in  the  year
                 to April 2015 she  earned  �13,362.39  from  Compass  Group
                 according to the P60 from that organisation.
       10.  The appellant's bundle includes a  letter  from  Medirest  of  4
                 October 2016 showing that she is working full-time  earning
                 �17,010.67 per annum excluding overtime and it confirms she
                 has been employed  by  Medirest  since  November  2013.  It
                 appears that she is paid  through  the  Compass  Group  and
                 there are payslips from them for 2016 all of which  confirm
                 her gross income to be �17,010. Even without her second job
                 she  therefore  is  earning  sufficient  to  maintain   the
                 appellant.
       11.  Whilst the appellant did not meet the strict requirements of the
                 rules at the date of decision I am satisfied that his  wife
                 is currently earning �17,010 per annum and would  therefore
                 meet the  requirements  of  appendix  FM  with  regards  to
                 salary. As it  is  only  the  financial  position  and  the
                 specified documents which were put in issue I can  find  no
                 public interest reason to require the appellant to reapply.
                 If he were to reapply today he  would  meet  the  financial
                 requirements and there is therefore no public  interest  in
                 excluding him."


4.    The ECO appeals on the ground that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  applied
    the wrong income threshold. The First-tier Tribunal allowed the  appeal
    despite finding that the appellant did not meet the strict requirements
    of the immigration rules without considering  whether  there  were  any
    compelling circumstances that might justify a grant of entry  clearance
    outside the rules: SSHD v SS (Congo) and  Others  [2015]  Imm  AR  1036
    referred.

Decision and reasons

Error of law

5.    After having  considered  the  submissions  made  by  both  parties  I
    concluded that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making  of
    an error of law and set aside the First-tier decision.

6.    The judge referred to the correct income  threshold  when  summarising
    the respondent's reasons for refusal [2], but  in  the  course  of  her
    findings she concluded that the sponsor's  earnings  of  �17,010  would
    meet the salary requirements of Appendix FM [11]. On  the  face  of  it
    this finding indicates that the wrong income threshold might have  been
    applied. Although the judge referred to two sources of  income  earlier
    in the decision [9], it is not sufficiently clear from  her  conclusion
    in [11] whether more than one source of income formed the basis of  the
    decision. The judge's comment at the end of [10] that, even without her
    second job, the sponsor was earning sufficient income to  maintain  the
    appellant, reinforces the suggestion that she considered an  income  of
    �17,010 to be sufficient. The application of the wrong income threshold
    and/or the lack of clarity in the reasoning amounts to an error of law.



Re-making the decision

7.    The  entry  clearance  application  was  made  on  12  May  2015.  The
    respondent refused the application in a decision dated 12 August  2016.
    This  is  a  'new  style'  appeal  following  amendments  made  to  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  ("NIAA  2002")  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014. The appellant  has  a  right  of  appeal  to  the
    Tribunal because the respondent decided to refuse a human rights claim.

8.    Paragraph GEN.1.1 of Appendix FM of the immigration rules makes  clear
    that the route is for those seeking to enter or remain in the UK on the
    basis of their family life. Appendix FM sets out the requirements to be
    met and, in considering applications under that route it reflects  how,
    under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, the balance
    will be struck between the right to respect for private and family life
    and public interest considerations relating  public  security  and  the
    maintenance of immigration control. An application for entry  clearance
    as a spouse under Appendix FM  is  therefore  a  'human  rights  claim'
    giving rise to a right of appeal. The respondent's policy on "Rights of
    Appeal" also confirms that an application for leave to enter or  remain
    as a family member under Appendix FM will be treated as a 'human rights
    claim' giving rise to a right of appeal.

9.    The previous long standing position under section 85A(2) was that  the
    Tribunal could only consider "the  circumstances  appertaining  at  the
    time of the decision" in an appeal against a decision to  refuse  entry
    clearance. Section 85A of the NIAA 2002 was repealed by the Immigration
    Act 2014 ("IA 2014") subject to  transitional  and  savings  provisions
    (SI: 2015/371). The remaining provision relating to the  assessment  of
    evidence in 'new style' appeals is section 85(4), which states:

            "(4) On an appeal under section 82(1)  against  a  decision  the
           Tribunal may consider any matter which it thinks relevant to the
           substance of the decision, including a matter arising after  the
           date of the decision."

10.   The consequence of these changes is that the  Tribunal  is  no  longer
    required to consider the circumstances appertaining at the time of  the
    decision in an appeal involving an entry clearance decision. The  right
    of appeal arises against a decision to refuse  a  human  rights  claim.
    Whether an appeal relates to the refusal of a human rights claim in the
    context of refusal of entry clearance or leave to remain  the  Tribunal
    may consider any matter which it thinks relevant to  the  substance  of
    the decision,  including  a  matter  arising  after  the  date  of  the
    decision. The only  restriction  is  the  new  provision  contained  in
    section 85(5)-(6) relating to consideration of 'new matters'.

11.   The repeal of section 85A of the NIAA 2002  harmonises  the  treatment
    of evidence in statutory appeals. The Tribunal must  now  consider  all
    appeals on the evidence as it stands at the date of the hearing.

12.   In so far as the requirements of the immigration rules might form  one
    part of a private and family life assessment made by the Tribunal under
    Article 8, any requirements for evidence covering a certain  period  of
    time prior to the application  might  need  to  be  considered.  If  an
    appellant met the requirements of the immigration rules it is likely to
    provide a strong indication of where the balance should  be  struck  in
    light of the policy expressed in  paragraph  GEN.1.1  of  Appendix  FM.
    However, the Tribunal may consider any matter which it thinks  relevant
    to the substance of the decision, including any  matter  arising  after
    the decision, as part of a holistic  assessment  of  the  human  rights
    claim. Whether  the  appellant  met  the  strict  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules might form one part of that overall assessment.

13.   It is not disputed that the appellant is in a genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a British citizen. They have a four-year-old daughter
    (DOB: 06/08/13) who is also a  British  citizen.  She  lives  with  her
    mother in the UK. The sponsor says that she  visits  the  appellant  in
    Pakistan every year and they are in daily contact by telephone. I  find
    that the evidence shows that the appellant  has  established  a  family
    life with his wife and daughter.

14.   The respondent recognises that it would normally not be reasonable  to
    expect a British child to leave the UK, or to expect the  child  to  be
    separated  from  a  parent,  unless  there  are  strong  public  policy
    considerations  such  as  criminality  or  a  "very  poor   immigration
    history":  see  Immigration  Directorate  Instructions:  "Appendix   FM
    Section 1.0b Family Life (as a partner or parent) and Private Life:  10
    Year Routes" (August 2015) referred to in MA  (Pakistan)  &  Ors  v  UT
    (IAC)  &  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705.   No   strong   public   policy
    considerations would appear to apply on the facts  of  this  case.  The
    effect of the decision is to prolong the separation  of  the  appellant
    from his wife and daughter in  circumstances  where  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK. For  these  reasons,  I
    concluded that the decision to refuse entry clearance shows a  lack  of
    respect for the appellant's family life that is sufficiently  grave  to
    engage the operation of Article 8 (points (i) & (ii) of Lord  Bingham's
    five stage approach in Razgar v SSHD [2004] INLR 349).

15.   The state can lawfully interfere with an applicant's  family  life  if
    it is pursuing a legitimate aim and it is necessary  and  proportionate
    in all the circumstances of the case. In cases involving  human  rights
    issues under Article 8, the heart of  the  assessment  is  whether  the
    decision strikes a fair balance between the due weight to be  given  to
    the public interest in maintaining an effective system  of  immigration
    control and the impact of the decision on the individual's  private  or
    family life. In assessing whether the decision strikes a fair balance a
    court or tribunal should give appropriate weight  to  Parliament's  and
    the Secretary of State's assessment of  the  strength  of  the  general
    public interest as expressed in the relevant rules  and  statutes:  see
    Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60.

16.   The application was refused  on  the  sole  ground  that  insufficient
    evidence was produced to show that  the  appellant  met  the  financial
    requirements contained in Appendix FM. At the date of  the  application
    on 14 May 2015 the appellant was required to produce specified evidence
    outlined in Appendix FM-SE to show that his wife earned a gross  annual
    income of at least �18,600. The requirements set out in Appendix  FM-SE
    are complex and are  likely  to  be  difficult  for  a  lay  person  to
    understand. The appellants' wife was in  non-salaried  employment.  The
    specified evidence he was required to produce included payslips for six
    months prior to the date of the application, a letter from the employer
    who issued the payslips and personal bank statements  corresponding  to
    the same period as the payslips showing that the salary had  been  paid
    into the account (paragraph 2(a)-(c) Appendix FM-SE).

17.   The appellant's wife worked for the same employer  for  at  least  six
    months. The appellant was required to  show  that  she  had  been  paid
    throughout  the  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application at a  level  of  gross  annual  salary  which  equalled  or
    exceeded the required level of income relied upon  in  the  application
    (paragraph 13(a) Appendix FM-SE). Further provisions are set out in the
    immigration rules as to how  to  calculate  gross  annual  income  from
    salaried and non-salaried employment (paragraph 18 Appendix FM-SE).  In
    this case the required level of income was �18,600.

18.   The appellant's wife says that she had two sources of  income  at  the
    date of application. First, she worked as a catering  assistant  for  a
    company called Medirest (part of the Compass group). Second, she worked
    for a Pizza Hut franchise, which traded under the name Charlton Village
    Services Ltd. The company was taken over by Oasis West Solutions Ltd in
    April 2015.

19.   Mr Nasim argued that the sponsor's income  from  her  employment  with
    Medirest,  taken  alone,  was  sufficient   to   meet   the   financial
    requirements of the immigration rules. He set out various  calculations
    with reference to the payslips in his written arguments. The  appellant
    produced copies  of  his  wife's  payslips  covering  the  period  from
    November 2014 to May 2015. The payslips indicate that she was paid  for
    'non-salaried employment', which  is  defined  in  paragraph  18(d)  of
    Appendix FM-SE as paid on an hourly  rate  or  according  to  the  work
    undertaken. The gross annual income covering the six  months'  payslips
    was �9,490.31. For the purpose of calculating the gross  annual  income
    of non-salaried  employment  at  the  date  of  the  application  under
    paragraph 13(a)(i) of Appendix FM-SE the level of gross  annual  salary
    relied upon "shall be no greater than  the  annual  equivalent  of  the
    person's average gross monthly income from non-salaried  employment  in
    the six months prior  to  the  date  of  the  application,  where  that
    employment was held throughout that period" (paragraph  18(e)  Appendix
    FM-SE). Therefore, the sponsor's average monthly income in the relevant
    six-month period preceding the application was �1,581.72, which for the
    purpose of calculating the gross annual income amounts to �18,980.64.

20.   The appellant produced three letters from Medirest dated 02  September
    2015, 04 October 2016 and 05 October 2016. Although this  evidence  was
    not sent with the  original  application  nothing  in  the  wording  of
    paragraph 2(b) of Appendix FM-SE  would  appear  to  preclude  me  from
    considering it. The only  requirement  is  that  the  letter  sets  out
    various pieces of information relating  to  the  sponsor's  employment.
    Although it is not clear why the information could not be  included  in
    one letter, the set of correspondence appears to contain the  specified
    information regarding her employment history and salary rates.

21.   The appellant also produced the sponsor's  personal  bank  statements,
    which show the relevant net salary  payments  from  the  Compass  Group
    entering  her  account.  The  statements  are   consistent   with   the
    information contained in the payslips.

22.   For the reasons given above I  am  satisfied  that  the  evidence  now
    before the Tribunal shows on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    appellant met the financial requirements of the  immigration  rules  at
    the date of the decision. For the sake of completeness, at the date  of
    the hearing, the evidence shows that the appellant's wife continues  to
    work for Medirest and now works  for  a  second  company  called  Sound
    Sorba. Her combined gross annual income from both sources of employment
    continues to be over the �18,600 threshold.

23.   A holistic assessment of Article 8 might also take into account  other
    family life factors such as the appellant's relationship with his wife,
    the best interests of their child (which is to be brought  up  by  both
    parents)  and  the  adverse  effect  of  continued  separation.  If  an
    appellant did not meet the requirements of  the  immigration  rules  it
    might also  be  necessary  to  consider  the  public  interest  factors
    outlined in section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 ("NIAA 2002") insofar as they might have any  relevance  to  entry
    clearance applications.

24.   However, is not necessary to consider those matters in detail in  this
    decision. The immigration rules are said to strike a fair  balance  for
    the  purpose  of  assessing  an  application  under   Article   8.   In
    circumstances where the evidence  shows  that  the  appellant  met  the
    relevant requirements the decision to refuse entry clearance  showed  a
    lack  of  respect  for   the   appellant's   family   life   that   was
    disproportionate in the circumstances of this case (points (iv)  &  (v)
    of Lord Bingham's five stage approach in Razgar).

25.   I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved  the  making
    of an error of law. The decision is set aside and  remade.  I  conclude
    that the respondent's decision to refuse  the  human  rights  claim  is
    unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
