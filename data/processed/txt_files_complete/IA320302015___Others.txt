               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms L Irvine, Advocate; Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are husband, wife and two young children,  all  citizens
    of Nigeria.  The cases all turn on the outcome in respect of the  first
    appellant.

 2. The first appellant entered the UK as a student on 1  January  2010.  A
    further application to remain as such  was  refused  on  19  May  2015.
    Following an administrative review, that decision was maintained  on  2
    June 2015.

 3. An application was then submitted to remain on  human  rights  grounds,
    that is to say, outwith  the  terms  of  the  immigration  rules.   The
    respondent  refused  that  application  on  15  September   2015.   The
    respondent considered the  circumstances  by  reference  to  the  rules
    regarding the partner route, the parent route, and  private  life,  and
    found no basis on which leave might be granted. Turning to "exceptional
    circumstances", outside the rules, the respondent said:

      ... you have requested that you be granted leave outside the rules  to
      enable you to continue your studies in the UK...

      Article 2 of protocol 1 - the right to education - of  the  ECHR  does
      not obligate the state to provide education to foreign nationals  with
      no legal basis to remain here. There is nothing to  prevent  you  from
      availing yourself of the educational services in your own  country  or
      elsewhere.

      It would  also  undermine  the  purposes  of  the  immigration  system
      relating to tier 4 general students should you  be  granted  leave  to
      remain outside the rules ... Exercising discretion in  your  favour...
      would be to treat you in a more favourable manner  compared  to  other
      persons who are either in a similar position  and  have  been  refused
      leave to remain or who can meet the requirements for leave  under  the
      Tier 4 general student rules.

      ... This decision is... Reasonable and in accordance with  the  United
      Kingdom's obligations ['s with respect to] the best interests  of  the
      child...

      [Various considerations are narrated to explain that the  decision  is
      consistent with proper regard for the best interests of the children].

 4. The appellant appealed to the first-tier tribunal against the  decision
    of 15 September 2015, stating the following grounds:

      The decision is unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
      The decision is a disproportionate breach of the  appellant's  private
      life as protected by article 8 ECHR.  The  appellant  relies  upon  OA
      (Nigeria) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 982 ... He should be granted  a  form
      of leave under article 8 in order to allow him  to  complete  his  PhD
      studies in the UK due to the exceptional nature of his research -  see
      letter of support from Dr Alan Cuthbertson, 14th June 25.

 5. The ground of appeal on which permission  was  sought  and  granted  to
    appeal to the upper tribunal is exactly  the  same.  It  relies  on  an
    article 8 private life interest in respect  of  the  first  appellant's
    studies only. No application was made to amend or widen those  grounds.
    Although some further features of the case were mentioned, there is  no
    conceivable basis on which the case  might  succeed  in  terms  of  the
    appellants' private and family life in the UK,  other  than  the  first
    appellant's interest in completing his studies.  I emphasise that point
    again at the end of this decision.

 6. First-tier tribunal judge  Fox  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by
    decision promulgated on 22 December 2015. In  the  preparation  of  his
    decision, something went badly wrong.  There  is  a  narration  of  the
    family details at paragraph 1 but the rest of the decision  is  garbled
    and irrelevant. Perhaps some error resulted in  the  issue  of  a  very
    preliminary draft as if it were final.  The  respondent  conceded  that
    there was error  of  law  and  that  an  entirely  fresh  decision  was
    required.

 7. I raised the question whether this may be one of those instances  where
    appellants have the option of withdrawing the appeal  and  using  a  28
    days period of grace to make a further application in  compliance  with
    the immigration rules. However, representatives concurred that  such  a
    procedural option would not be open to the  appellants  and  that  they
    could not make any other application for the respondent's consideration
    without leaving the UK.

 8. The first appellant's good academic and immigration history to  20  May
    2015 is undisputed. His explanation for the failure of the  application
    under the rules is that the necessary  funds  were  held  in  the  bank
    account of his wife (the second appellant) and not in his. He  says  at
    paragraph 5 of his paragraph 9 of his statement dated 20 November  2015
    that on the failure of  his  application,  he  was  unable  to  proceed
    further with his studies in Heriot Watt University.  It  was  suggested
    that he might complete his course  at  the  Dubai  campus  or  Malaysia
    campus but this was impractical because he had a custom-made laboratory
    in Edinburgh and facilities could not be duplicated elsewhere. Nor  was
    it possible for him to arrange to finish his programme from Nigeria. He
    did discuss  with  the  University  legal  department  making  a  fresh
    application within the 28 day period, but  he  was  advised  that  this
    would not succeed, although the University did not tell him  the  exact
    reason (and none is apparent from his  evidence)  (paragraph  12).  His
    research would be valuable to the university and to the UK in  general,
    letters to which effect have been provided by supervisors. He states at
    paragraph 15 that would not be possible to leave  the  UK  to  make  an
    entry clearance application, because they would no longer  be  able  to
    meet the financial requirements, and  it  would  "not  be  possible  to
    uproot my three young children from the UK at such short  notice".  The
    statement also refers to longer term academic and employment  prospects
    in the UK.

 9. Ms Irvine said that the preference of the appellants was for their case
    to be decided in the upper tribunal without further delay. There was no
    change in the essential underlying circumstances (which are not in  any
    significant dispute). The appellant had been able in  the  meantime  to
    work on his thesis, but he was unable  to  have  it  examined,  and  to
    complete it he needed access  to  laboratory.  That  was  not  possible
    unless he had a grant of leave. The predicted period for completion was
    six months.

10. The argument for the appellants  as  set  out  in  a  written  note  of
    argument and as amplified in oral submissions by Ms Irvine is along the
    following lines. The issue was "whether  or  not  the  refusal  of  the
    appellant's application for leave to remain in the UK solely  in  order
    to complete his PhD studies is a proportionate  interference  with  his
    right to respect for private and family life under  article  8  of  the
    ECHR". The appellant has a  scholarship  from  Heriot  Watt  University
    which over the period of its grant covers both tuition fees and  course
    -related expenses; the amount of tuition fees paid by University  would
    total just over �42,000. The University would also build  a  customised
    laboratory  for  the  appellant.  The  only  reason  for  refusing  the
    application in 2015 related to funds  which  were  shown  in  the  bank
    statements but were those  of  the  appellant's  spouse.  When  seeking
    further leave  outside  the  rules,  the  appellant  pointed  out  that
    "evidential flexibility" might have been exercised by the respondent in
    relation to  the  earlier  application,  but  no  request  for  further
    evidence had been made. The covering letter also noted that the  effect
    of the refusal would be for the  appellant  to  have  lost  his  entire
    investment of close to �80,000 over the course of his PhD studies,  and
    that there would be "irreparable consequences for his life and the life
    lives of his family members".

11. It was accepted that it would be a rare case in which an application by
    a student for leave to remain on article 8 grounds would be successful.
    It was also accepted that there is no  sliding  scale  related  to  how
    closely the application came to the  requirements  of  the  immigration
    rules. The factors in favour of the appellant were (1) the value  which
    may attach to his studies in Scotland for the wider community, as shown
    by the letter from his supervisor  (  improved  prediction  of  coastal
    erosion); (2) the substantial cost of  the  appellant  studies  to  the
    publicly funded Heriot Watt University, the figure of �42,000 cited not
    taking into account the cost of customising  the  laboratory;  (3)  the
    refusal of the earlier application due only to  genuine  error  on  the
    part of the appellants, but repeated "because of an  earlier  error  on
    the part of the respondent herself" (it is  said  that  in  an  earlier
    successful application the funds had also been the  wife's  name);  (4)
    the appellant's investment of intellect, time and money over and  above
    that University; (5) finally  and  most  significantly,  the  appellant
    could not complete his  PhD  unless  given  access  to  the  customised
    laboratory at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh which  could  not  be
    replicated elsewhere. The only factors on the  respondent's  side  were
    the maintenance of the integrity of the rules, and being  seen  not  to
    treat the  appellant  more  favourably  than  other  applicants.  Those
    requirements might  have  been  relaxed  if  respondent  had  exercised
    evidential flexibility which she was required in certain  circumstances
    to do.

12. Ms Irvine said that if the  appeals  failed  and  the  appellants  left
    voluntarily, they would be subject to a 12 month  ban  on  return.  The
    academic opportunity was understood to be still  available,  but  after
    such further lapse of  time  it  might  not  be.  At  best,  the  first
    appellant might be able to resume his studies after a delay which would
    run over 12 months. This was one of  those  rare  student  cases  which
    ought to succeed.

13. Mr Matthews in reply said that it was correct that there would be a  12
    month re-entry ban. He submitted that was not a factor which should  be
    given significant weight in the appellant's favour. The  appellant  had
    the option of making a fresh application in 2015  after  adjusting  the
    finances in the bank accounts. There was no explanation why he did  not
    do so. He also had the option then of returning to Nigeria and making a
    fresh application from  there,  without  restriction  on  re-entry.  By
    either route, he might by now have completed his studies.  It  was  his
    decision  to  take  the  matter  further  by  way  of  a  human  rights
    application, outside the rules, from within the  UK.  The  consequences
    were of his own making. It was nothing to the point that an application
    made in 2012 might have been granted "in error" in the basis  of  funds
    in his wife's account. It was his obligation to comply with  the  terms
    of the immigration rules in all applications.  There was nothing  which
    might have triggered an obligation in terms of evidential  flexibility.
    The system of immigration control should not be set to one side  simply
    because the appellant made a mistake in his application.  There  was  a
    route for leave to remain in the UK as a student, prescribed by tier  4
    of the points-based system. The tenor  of  some  of  the  evidence  and
    submissions for the appellants was that they had  a  general  right  in
    terms of private and family life to remain in the longer  term  in  the
    UK, not simply for purposes of the  appellant's  studies.  Mr  Matthews
    argued that there was no foundation for any such expectation, and  that
    if any leave were to be granted outside the  rules,  it  would  be  for
    purposes of completing studies only, and not such as to  give  rise  to
    any long-term expectations. Turning from the rules for students to  the
    rules for private life, Mr Matthews did not exclude that  there   might
    be a student case which did qualify under article 8 of the ECHR, but he
    emphasised that article 8 is not a general dispensing power, that there
    was another route that the appellant could have taken, and the  private
    rules were also to be  applied,  which  generally  strike  the  correct
    balance. The appellant made unlikely assertions that he would  have  no
    job and no future in Nigeria. Even if the appellant would not  be  able
    to complete his PhD, there was no disproportionate  result.  There  was
    very nothing in terms of the  children's  best  interests  which  might
    affect the outcome. In terms of part 5A of the 2002 Act and the broader
    article 8  consideration,  it  was  of  little  significance  that  the
    appellants might be financially self-supporting.  In Forman [2015] UKUT
    412 a panel of the UT including the president confirmed that the public
    interest  in  firm  immigration  control  was  not   diluted   by   the
    consideration that the article  8  claimant  had  at  no  time  been  a
    financial burden on the state, was self-sufficient and  was  likely  to
    remain so indefinitely (paragraph 15).  It  is  well  established  that
    there is no right to remain in the UK to study, and that article  8  is
    not a general dispensing power.  The  appellant  could  point  to  some
    factors in his favour, but the law in general was entirely against him.
    It might arguably be a hard case, but things sometimes  go  wrong,  and
    the reasons for that were the responsibility of the appellant  and  not
    of the respondent. The appeal should be dismissed.

14. In reply Ms Irving  said  the  case  did  include  an  element  of  the
    children's best interests, and that there were  long-term  consequences
    which might be adverse for them. However, the  crucial  features  which
    she  emphasised  were  the  inability  to  replicate   facilities   for
    completion of the appellant's PhD elsewhere,  and  the  fact  that  for
    practical purposes his PhD could only be obtained through  a  grant  of
    leave in these proceedings.

15. I reserved my decision.

16. There is no significant dispute about the  facts,  and  little  dispute
    about the law, apart from the matters in the next two paragraphs.

17. It has not been shown that there was in prior procedure any failure  by
    the respondent on the basis  of  evidential  flexibility  to  give  the
    appellant an opportunity to put matters right.

18. Forman was concerned with a long term claim to  leave  to  remain,  not
    with completion of studies.  That is an important distinction.

19. Mr Matthews made a reasonable  argument  that  the  deficiency  in  the
    failed application under the rules was the appellant's  responsibility,
    and that he had options other than reliance on human rights.  He has no
    comprehensible reason for not applying again within the 28 day  period.
    He might alternatively have put matters right from outside the UK.

20. The foregoing are I think the best points on the respondent's side.

21. The appellant's case has at times strayed into contentions that he  and
    his family may have some claim to stay remain here,  based  on  private
    and family life, beyond  the  requirements  of  the  rules  and  beyond
    completion of  his  studies.   I  regard  any  such  case  as  entirely
    hopeless.  There is no reason at all why the appellants  might  not  be
    subject to the rules, apart from that one issue.

22. On that one issue, this is a finely balanced case.  The  other  options
    available to the appellant may not have been apparent at the time.  The
    advice given to him (by previous advisers, and now with the benefit  of
    hindsight) may not have represented  the  best  option.   However,  the
    human rights issue has  to  be  decided  as  matters  presently  stand.
    Subject to my observations above, I find the factors argued  in  favour
    of his completing his studies quite strong.  Those  studies  are  at  a
    high and useful level, are near to completion,  and  realistically  are
    not likely to be completed  otherwise.     There  is  always  a  public
    interest in maintaining immigration control through the rules,  but  in
    this case I think it should give way, and that the  decisions  appealed
    against represent a disproportionate interference.

23. This decision should give rise to no expectation  that  the  appellants
    are entitled to remain here, without  complying  with  the  immigration
    rules, for any purpose apart from completion of the  first  appellant's
    PhD.

24. The determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
    appeals, as originally brought to the FtT, are allowed.

25. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
