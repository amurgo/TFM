Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr L Lourdes, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State and the respondent is Mr Karki.
     However for the purposes of this decision, I refer to the  parties  as
    they were before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  where  Mr  Karki  was  the
    appellant.

 2. Mr Karki is a citizen of Nepal born on 11 February 1988 who appealed to
    the First-tier Tribunal against the decision of the  respondent,  dated
    26 October 2016, to refuse the appellant's  application  for  leave  to
    remain outside of the Immigration Rules (to  enable  the  appellant  to
    continue his studies in the UK).  In a decision promulgated on 26 March
    2018, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Moore  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal.

 3. The Secretary of State  appeals,  with  permission,  on  the  following
    grounds:

         Ground one: Making a material misdirection of law  -  the  Tribunal
         directed that the Secretary of State grant leave for which there is
         no power to remit a decision as per Greenwood No 2;

         Ground two: Failing to give reasons for  findings  on  an  adequate
         matter. Shehzad & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 615  -  it  was  argued  the
         Tribunal failed to give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
         appellant had not practised deception;

         Ground three - it was argued that the Tribunal  erred  in  allowing
         the appeal to enable the appellant  to  continue  his  studies  and
         failing to take into consideration the current case  law  including
         Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72.

Error of Law Hearing

 4. Mr Jarvis submitted that the judge had misunderstood the impact of  the
    Secretary of State's evidence and had misapplied Shehzad.    Mr  Jarvis
    submitted that the starting point  was  wrong  and  the  Tribunal  only
    looked  at  the  appellant's  and  had  materially  misunderstood   the
    evidence.  The First-tier Tribunal had failed to consider the  evidence
    of Professor French.  Mr Jarvis relied on paragraph 56  of  MA  Nigeria
    [2016] UKUT 450:

         "Second, we acknowledge the suggestion that the  appellant  had  no
         reason to engage in deception which we have found proven.   However
         this has not deflected  us  in  any  way  from  reaching  our  main
         findings and conclusions.  In the abstract, of course, there  is  a
         range of reasons why persons proficient in English  may  engage  in
         TOEIC fraud.  These include, inexhaustively,  lack  of  confidence,
         fear of failure, lack of time and commitment and contempt  for  the
         immigration system.  These reasons  could  conceivably  overlap  in
         individual cases and there is  scope  for  other  explanations  for
         deceitful conduct in this sphere.  We are not required to make  the
         further finding of why the appellant engaged in  deception  and  to
         this we add that this issue was not explored  during  the  hearing.
         We resist any temptation to speculate about this discrete matter."

 5. In relation to Article 8 Mr Jarvis submitted that even if the  Tribunal
    was not with him in relation to the deception point  the  jurisprudence
    on Article 8 and private life pointed to an error of law by the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 6. Patel & Others [2013] UKSC 72 reminds that:

         "The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course  in
         this country however desirable in general terms is not in itself  a
         right protected under Article 8."

 7. Mr Jarvis further relied on the Court of  Appeal  in  Rhuppiah  v  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 803: although the appellant had finance for his studies
    he was not financially independent from his family.

 8. Mr Lourdes submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  did  apply  the  law
    correctly and was entitled to  reach  the  findings  that  he  did;  he
    submitted reminded that the evidence of Peter  Millington  and  Rebecca
    Collings did not have any personal  knowledge  of  the  appellant.   Mr
    Lourdes relied on the appellant's witness statements and  the  evidence
    he had given to the First-tier Tribunal about how he stated he  got  to
    the test centre and  how  long  it  took  him  and  other  accompanying
    evidence.  Mr Lourdes accepted however that the Article 8 case law  was
    against him in relation to private life.

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  problematic.   This  was  a
    case where the appellant's application failed,  in  part,  due  to  the
    respondent concluding that he had cheated in an English language  test.
    Although the judge acknowledged the evidence before him, including  the
    respondent's supplementary bundles and cited  Shehzad,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal materially erred in its  approach,  including  in  failing  to
    acknowledge, or make adequate findings on,  the  respective  legal  and
    evidential burdens of proof on the respondent and the appellant and the
    shifting evidential burden.  The First-tier Tribunal failed to  examine
    the case in the correct context of the relevant case law  and  to  take
    the correct legal  steps  in  determining  whether  the  appellant  was
    correctly refused under the general grounds of refusal.

10. The Tribunal also erred in concluding at  [25]  that  the  respondent's
    evidence was 'generic' without any analysis  or  adequate  findings  in
    relation to the case specific evidence in this case, relating  to  Eden
    College International Test Centre.

11.  In  addition,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  misdirected  itself  in  its
    consideration of Article 8 including it its  consideration  of  Section
    117B where little weight must be afforded to  the  appellant's  private
    life, as it was established when his presence in the UK was precarious.
      The judge also erred in his consideration of financial  independence,
    given that  the  appellant  relies  on  his  family  for  funding.   In
    addition, there was nothing compelling or exceptional identified in the
    appellant's case which might warrant  a  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

12. The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  errors  of  law
    therefore, such that it should be set aside.   It  was  agreed  by  the
    parties that I could remake the decision.

Remaking the Decision

13. I heard oral evidence from the appellant who gave evidence  in  English
    and adopted his amended witness statement of 9 November  2017  together
    with a "statement of purpose" which he had prepared for the purposes of
    his studies.  There was also additional evidence including in the  form
    of the appellant's application for admission to the University of  West
    Scotland  and  email  IELTS  correspondence.   I  had  before  me   the
    appellant's bundle before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  respondent's
    bundle and supplementary evidence (as set out in the decision of First-
    tier Tribunal at [5]).  The appellant's evidence is set out in full  in
    the Record of Proceedings.  I also heard submissions from both  parties
    which are also recorded in the Record of Proceedings.

14.  In  summary,  Mr  Jarvis  relied  on  the  Home  Office  evidence  and
    supplementary bundles.  This included document 7 of  the  supplementary
    bundle, the Home Office 'Project Fa�ade'  criminal  enquiry  into  Eden
    College, where the appellant states he took the  ETS  test  on  5  June
    2013.  Paragraph 11 of that report indicates  that  during  the  period
    from 20 March 2012 to 5 February  2014,  there  was  a  colossal  fraud
    underway and 77% of the tests were found to be invalid.

15. Mr Jarvis further submitted that the evidence establishes that there is
    less than 1% chance of a false positive.  Paragraph 14 of  the  Project
    Fa�ade document indicated that approximately 1,131 students availed  of
    "pilots" who took the  test  for  them  at  Eden  College.   Mr  Jarvis
    submitted that the appellant's oral  evidence  indicated  that  he  had
    attended a centre quite a significant journey from his  home,  an  hour
    and fifteen minutes.  The appellant claimed that he  did  not  see  any
    evidence of proxies and did not  see  any  evidence  of  questions  and
    answers being read out, which was also an element of the ETS fraud.  Mr
    Jarvis asked me to find the appellant's evidence  unreliable  and  that
    either he did not attend the test and a proxy was used or he was  party
    to the fraud at the test centre.

16. Mr Jarvis submitted that the fact that the appellant may  have  English
    qualifications, which is relied on by  the  appellant,  is  beside  the
    point and there are a number of reasons why an individual  might  agree
    to participate in a fraud.  It was submitted that the appellant had not
    provided an innocent explanation, the evidential burden  having  passed
    to him.  There was  nothing  from  the  college  in  Aldgate  that  the
    appellant had referred to, to indicate that he had tried to book a test
    initially with them.  The appellant in oral evidence confirmed that  he
    did not request a recording from ETS and as such there was no  separate
    assessment of the recording.  The Tribunal  was  asked  to  reject  his
    explanation.  Mr Jarvis also pointed out that the  appellant  only  did
    two of the four possible tests, a further possible indication that  the
    appellant had obtained a fraudulent test.

17. In relation to Article 8, Mr  Jarvis  submitted  that  the  appellant's
    application was outside the Rules, he  was  not  applying  for  Tier  4
    leave.  There was no evidence the appellant met the Immigration  Rules.
    Even if  the  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that  the  respondent  had
    demonstrated that deception had taken place, little  weight  should  be
    attached to the appellant's private life.

18. Mr Lourdes submitted that the appellant did  not  use  the  certificate
    obtained from Eden College and the appellant did not sit the other  two
    modules.  Mr Lourdes pointed to the appellant's evidence of how he went
    to the test centre and why he took the test there.  He  submitted  that
    the appellant's evidence that when he found out about  the  college  on
    the BBC, his evidence that circumstances had overtaken and he therefore
    did not need the test and made  no  further  enquiries,  was  credible.
    However there was evidence before the Tribunal that the  appellant  had
    contacted ETS.

19. Mr Lourdes further submitted that the appellant was not  a  person  who
    does not speak English; he has been assessed  by  a  college  in  Nepal
    before coming to the UK.  He has been assessed by Sunderland University
    where he had taken a diploma  in  business  management.   He  had  also
    completed an MBA.  It was submitted he had no motivation to cheat.   Mr
    Lourdes submitted that whilst MA  Nigeria  indicated  that  there  were
    reasons why an individual may  cheat  Mr  Lourdes  submitted  that  the
    appellant in MA Nigeria  had  had  a  number  of  negative  credibility
    factors.  It was submitted that the appellant  has  given  an  innocent
    explanation and that  the  legal  burden  of  proof  remains  with  the
    Secretary of State which it was submitted was not discharged.   It  was
    submitted that the Secretary of State had  discretion  to  grant  leave
    outside of the Rules and the appellant wanted to continue studying.

Findings

20. It is not disputed that the  appellant's  appeal  is  on  human  rights
    grounds alone.  I have considered the appeal through the prism  of  the
    Immigration Rules  including  the  respondent's  refusal  on  conducive
    grounds.

21. The application was refused under paragraph 322(1) of  the  Immigration
    Rules as the appellant applied for leave for a purpose not  covered  by
    the Immigration Rules.  Although the appellant did not seek to rely  on
    the particular certificate for  the  purposes  of  an  application  for
    leave, the respondent refused the appellant's application including  as
    the respondent was satisfied that  the  appellant's  presence  was  not
    conducive to the public  good  as  the  appellant's  conduct  makes  it
    undesirable to allow him to remain in the UK.

22. I have  considered  whether  the  generic  evidence  and  the  evidence
    relating to the appellant  discharges  the  evidential  burden  on  the
    Secretary of State, that the appellant  procured  his  TOEIC  tests  by
    dishonesty (see SM & Qadir V SSHD (ETS - Evidence -  Burden  of  Proof)
    [2016] UKUT 229).  In making this assessment, I  have  also  considered
    what was said in Shehzad.  The  Court  of  Appeal  concluded  that  the
    'generic evidence' together with the evidence that the individual  test
    was 'invalid' was sufficient to shift the evidential  burden  onto  the
    test taker to raise an innocent explanation.

23. In addition to the generic  evidence  of  Rebecca  Collings  and  Peter
    Millington I also had sight of the  additional  bundle,  including  the
    expert report of Professor French together with the  witness  statement
    of Jagdev Singh dated 22  February  2018.   Annex  A  of  that  witness
    statement confirms both the appellant's test certificate results,  from
    5 June 2013 at Eden College, to be 'invalid.'

24. I have considered the totality of the respondent's evidence,  including
    in relation to the process of the invalidation of the  ETS  tests,  the
    fact that the appellant's test was considered invalid (rather than just
    questionable), the likelihood of a false positive to be  'substantially
    less than 1% (Professor French) and the evidence  in  relation  to  the
    significant fraud perpetrated in the vast majority of  tests  taken  in
    Eden College during the time  period  covering  the  appellant's  tests
    there.

25. Considering the evidence in the round, although  the  legal  burden  of
    proof remains with  the  respondent,  I  am  satisfied  that  there  is
    adequate evidence to shift the evidential burden to  the  appellant  to
    provide an innocent application.

26. Having considered all the  evidence,  including  the  appellant's  oral
    evidence, I am  not  satisfied  that  he  provided  any  such  innocent
    explanation.  I did not find the appellant to  be  a  credible  witness
    including in his evidence in relation to allegedly taking the tests.

27. I have also considered that although he has more recently, in  February
    2018, made  an  email  enquiry  of  ETS  (which  resulted  in  a  reply
    reiterating that the appellant's Certificate was no  longer  valid  and
    that the appellant should raise any queries with the Home  Office)  the
    appellant could provide no adequate explanation as to why, when he  was
    made aware of the problems with ETS tests and fraud (and  he  confirmed
    in oral evidence that he saw this reported on television) he did not at
    the time approach the Home Office for example, or ETS or Eden  College.
    If as the appellant claims, he had no involvement  in  either  a  proxy
    taking his case or the fraud more generally his  failure  to  take  any
    action at the time in respect of his ETS  test,  particularly  when  he
    stated he had only at that stage completed two modules, is  lacking  in
    credibility when considered in the round.

28. Instead, the appellant stated he relied on an IELTS test  he  completed
    around the same time, as well as on separate assessments by  subsequent
    education providers.  I am not satisfied that this adequately  explains
    the appellant's failure to follow up at the time, in any way, his tests
    at Eden College, whether he  required  the  test  for  his  immigration
    status or not.  He was aware, on his own evidence that he heard  it  on
    the news, of problems with the ETS tests, yet made no attempts  at  the
    time to ensure, for example, that he was not tainted by  the  fraud.  I
    consider the appellant's credibility to be reduced.

29. In reaching this finding I  have  taken  into  consideration  that  the
    appellant did provide information as to how he claimed he travelled  to
    the test centre.  The fact that the appellant can  describe  a  journey
    does not in itself mean that I have to accept that he  is  telling  the
    truth.  Even if the appellant did travel to  the  hearing  centre  that
    does not mean that a proxy did not take his test.  He was also,  in  my
    findings, unable to provide any adequate explanation as to why he would
    take a test an hour and fifteen minute journey from his home.

30. Although the appellant stated  that  he  had  approached  another  test
    centre, at Aldgate, there was for example no other confirmation of  any
    such enquiry, or any  other  adequate  explanation,  where  such  ought
    reasonably to be available, as to why he did not approach another  test
    centre  closer  to  his  home.   Although  the   appellant   may   have
    subsequently demonstrated an acceptable level of English (and there was
    reference to him also taking an English test  prior  to  leaving  Nepal
    although no  other  adequate  information  in  relation  to  that  test
    although I accept he entered the UK as  a  Tier  4  student))  and  has
    subsequently taken a number of third level  qualifications,  that  does
    not amount to an innocent  explanation,  particular  in  light  of  his
    actions (and inactions) in 2013.

31. The fact that the appellant may have had a certain  level  of  English,
    even in 2013, does not mean that an individual would not use  a  proxy.
    I take into consideration what was said in MA Nigeria.  The credibility
    of the appellant in that case is irrelevant to the general  principles,
    espoused at paragraph 57, including  that  issues  including,  but  not
    limited to, lack of confidence, fear  of  failure,  lack  of  time  and
    commitment and  contempt  for  the  immigration  system,  may  lead  an
    individual  to  engage  in   TOEIC   fraud,   notwithstanding   English
    proficiency.

32. Having weighed all the material, although the burden  to  establish  an
    innocent explanation is a low one (the appellant  need  only  show  the
    minimal  level  of  plausibility)  I  am  not  satisfied  that  he  has
    discharged that burden.  I find that the  respondent  has  demonstrated
    that the appellant did obtain an ETS test  by  deception.   Although  I
    accept that the appellant did not use this test in any  application  to
    the respondent, there is no error in the respondent's  conclusion  that
    the appellant's presence in the UK is not conducive to the public  good
    due  to  the  appellant's  conduct  in  partaking  in  this   deception
    (paragraph 320(19) of the Immigration Rules).

Article 8

33. In addition (and in the alternative if I am wrong in relation to what I
    find to be the appellant's participation in deception) I not satisfied,
    in any event, that the appellant's appeal can succeed on  human  rights
    grounds.

34. It was not suggested that the  appellant  could  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules and indeed the appellant had applied for leave to remain, outside
    the Immigration Rules, to allow him to allow  him  to  make  a  further
    application as a student.  I take into account what was said  in  Patel
    and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 where it was reminded that  Article  8
    is not a general dispensing power:

         "It is to be distinguished from the Secretary of State's discretion
         to allow leave to remain outside the Rules, which may be  unrelated
         to any protected human right.  The merits  of  a  decision  not  to
         depart from the Rules are not reviewable on appeal: Section  86(6).
         One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call  in  Pankina  for  'common
         sense' in the application of the Rules to graduates who  have  been
         studying in the  UK  for  some  years  (see  paragraph  47  above).
         However such considerations do not by themselves provide grounds of
         appeal under Article 8, which is concerned with private  or  family
         life, not education as  such.   The  opportunity  for  a  promising
         student to complete his course in this country,  however  desirable
         in general terms, is not in itself a right protected under  Article
         8."

35. Although I accept the appellant has been in the UK for some time, since
    April 2011, I do not find that the appellant has shown that he has  any
    private or family life such that the respondent's decision to refuse to
    grant  further  leave  outside  the  Immigration   Rules   would   have
    sufficiently grave consequences to engage Article 8.

36. In the alternative that Article 8 is engaged, any interference with the
    right to respect for the appellant's private life is in accordance with
    the law and for the legitimate aim  of  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control.

37. I must give significant weight to the public interest.   The  appellant
    does not satisfy the requirements of any  Immigration  Rules.   I  have
    applied Section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002.  I have reminded myself that maintenance of  immigration  control
    is in the public interest.  Although the appellant states that he is in
    receipt of funding from his family it has not been established that  he
    is financially independent in the terms  considered  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Rhuppiah.  That is a factor in favour of the public interest.
     Although I accept the appellant now speaks English that is, at best, a
    neutral factor.

38. I take into account Section 117B(5) of the 2002  Act  and  that  little
    weight should be attached to private life developed in the UK  when  an
    individual's leave to remain is precarious.  There was no  evidence  to
    suggest the appellant's leave to remain in the  UK  has  been  anything
    other than precarious.  Although 'little weight' has been found to be a
    spectrum, there is nothing in the appellant's case that  would  suggest
    that anything other than little weight should be applied in  his  case.
    There was no other adequate evidence in relation to any  other  element
    of the appellant's private life in the UK, over and above his  studies,
    or any adequate evidence to suggest that there is anything  exceptional
    or compelling about the appellant's case which would require a grant of
    leave to remain in the UK.

39. Applying the balance sheet approach  (Hesham  Ali  [2016]  UKSC  60)  I
    accept that the appellant has pursued  a  significant  academic  career
    (and provided  an  application  to  the  University  of  West  Scotland
    (although his oral evidence suggested that he was unable to start  this
    course due to his immigration status)).  Nevertheless, even if  it  had
    not been established  that  the  appellant  obtained  an  ETS  test  by
    deception (which for the reasons above I  am  satisfied  he  did),  the
    factors in favour of  the  public  interest  outweigh  the  appellant's
    private life in the UK such as it is.

40. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  I substitute  my
    decision dismissing the appellant's appeal on Human Rights grounds

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
