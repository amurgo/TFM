                           (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)

                                     and




                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant and her daughter, K A, previously had appeals  before  the
    First-tier   Tribunal   bearing   appeal   numbers   AA/10063/2014   and
    AA/10065/2014 respectively. Those appeals were  allowed  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 15 January 2015 allowing them on the limited ground  that
    the decisions were not in accordance  with  the  law.   There  does  not
    appear to have been any timely application  by  the  respondent  against
    those decisions.

 2. Subsequent to the decisions of 15 January 2015, the  respondent  made  a
    fresh decision in respect of the appellant and her daughter,  which  was
    given the appeal number AA/05832/2015. That appeal was allowed on 18 May
    2016

 3. It appears that the respondent sought permission to appeal against  that
    decision, within time, but using the old reference  numbers.  That  has,
    understandably, caused a significant degree of confusion. In any  event,
    permission was refused by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Page  on  15  June
    2016.

 4. On 1 June 2017, the appellant's solicitors wrote a  pre-action  protocol
    letter regarding  the  ongoing  failure  to  issue  biometric  residence
    permits to them. The respondent replied on 7 June 2017, stating that she
    was awaiting a decision from the Upper Tribunal on a renewed application
    for permission to appeal but that, importantly, they would  not  now  be
    seeking to pursue it, and would implement the decision of 18 May 2016.

 5. This  information  was  not,  however,  conveyed  to  the  Tribunal  and
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on 19 June 2017.

 6. The appellant and her daughter have now been recognised as refugees  and
    granted leave to remain.

 7. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing that the appellants were the successful party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, and have now been granted leave as refugees, I give
    such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 8. Accordingly, with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 9. The effect of the respondent's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision, allowing the appellants' appeals, shall stand.

10. In all the circumstances of this case, it is  not  appropriate  to  make
    any costs order.




Signed                              Date:  25 July 2017
