                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr C Harding, Counsel.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use the titles by
    which the parties were known before the First-tier Tribunal,  with  the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the Respondent" and Mr Dandjinou  as
    "the Appellant".

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of the Cï¿½te d'Ivoire.  He  appealed  against
    the Respondent's decision of 22 September 2016 refusing his application
    for International Protection. That appeal was heard  by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Carroll who in a decision promulgated on 5 December
    2016 dismissed it on asylum and  humanitarian  protection  grounds  but
    allowed it on human rights grounds.

 3. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted  by  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Grant-Hutchison on  22  December  2016.  Her
    reasons for that decision are:-

         "The Respondent seeks  permission  in  time  to  appeal  against  a
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Carroll) promulgated  on
         5 December, 2016 whereby it allowed the Appellant's appeal  against
         the Secretary of State's decision to refuse the Appellant's  appeal
         on protection and human rights grounds.

         It is arguable that the Judge erred in law by misdirecting  herself
         in allowing the appeal on the basis of  Article  8  ECHR  when  the
         Appellant  has  been  granted  leave   due   to   the   exceptional
         circumstances which exist in relation to his case  until  2019  and
         therefore there can be no breach of his Article 8 rights caused  by
         the decision to refuse his application."

 4. Hence the appeal came before me today.

 5. At the outset both representatives were asked  by  me  to  confirm  the
    chronology.  It  was  agreed  that  the  Appellant's  application   for
    international protection was on 25 February 1993, that the decision  of
    the Respondent refusing it was  on  22  September  2016  and  that  the
    hearing of this appeal took place at Taylor House on 18 November  2016.
    Ms Ahmad relied on the only ground put forward  seeking  permission  to
    appeal which is that the Judge made a material misdirection of law. The
    ground states:-

         "It is respectfully  submitted  that  FTTJ  Carroll  has  erred  in
         allowing the instant appeal on the basis of article 8 ECHR.  It  is
         asserted that given the appellant has been granted leave due to the
         exceptional circumstances which exist in relation to his case,  the
         FTJ  is  misdirected  in  concluding  that  the  SSHD  decision  is
         disproportionate. The appellant has been granted  leave  to  remain
         until 2019 and therefore there can be no breach of  his  article  8
         rights caused by the decision to refuse his application for  asylum
         and any family and private life under the Immigration Rules."

 6. She emphasised that there could be no interference with the Appellant's
    private or  family  life  by  reason  of  the  decision  to  grant  him
    discretionary leave to remain until 2019.

 7. Mr Harding urged me to accept that there was an inevitable interference
    with the Appellant's private and family life and  highlighted  that  in
    carrying out her balancing exercise the Judge had properly  taken  into
    account the grant of  discretionary  leave  which  is  until  2019.  He
    referred me in  particular  to  paragraph  21  onward  of  the  Judge's
    decision and highlighted paragraph 23 where it states:-

         "...although the Respondent has been granted discretionary leave to
         remain until 2019 the refusal of the  claim  by  reference  to  his
         family and private life in the  Respondent's  Reasons  for  Refusal
         Letter gives rise to an interference with  the  Appellant's  family
         and private life...."

 8. I have deliberately set out the ground relied on by the  Respondent  in
    seeking permission to appeal. It does not assert  any  failure  by  the
    Judge to carry out a balancing exercise as required  or  that  she  has
    failed to balance the other factors in this appeal including the agreed
    facts that the Appellant has been in the United Kingdom now for some 24
    years during which time he has not left since his arrival. Also that he
    has formed relationships and has three children all of whom are British
    nationals and that he has lived and worked in the  United  Kingdom  for
    more than half of his life. Further that this is  an  exceptional  case
    where there has been considerable delay.

 9. The Judge has taken into account the discretionary leave and come to  a
    conclusion that was open to her  taking  into  account  all  the  other
    factors too and that the decision itself  is  disproportionate  in  the
    context of the unique circumstances that prevail  in  this  Appellant's
    case and the individual factual matrix that the Judge had to deal with.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

No anonymity direction is made. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  such
an order pursuant to its own procedural Rules and there  is  no  reason  put
forward why an order should now be made within the Upper Tribunal.
