Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Ali, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 3 November 1993.   On
    30  June  2016  she  made  an  application  for  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right of residence as the spouse of a British citizen
    exercising Treaty rights in another EEA State, in this case Ireland.

 2. That application was refused in a decision dated 21 February 2017, with
    reference to regulations 9 and 18 of the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").  The appellant's appeal
    against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal Judge S C  Clarke
    ("the FtJ") at a hearing on 26 February 2018 following which the appeal
    was dismissed.

 3. Permission to appeal the FtJ's decision was granted on the  basis  that
    the FtJ erred in her assessment of  the  evidence  in  support  of  the
    appeal and had not taken certain evidence into account.

 4. The following is a summary of the FtJ's decision.

    The FtJ's decision

 5. The FtJ summarised the evidence that she had before her,  referring  to
    the  respondent's  decision  and  the  indexed  and  paginated  bundles
    provided on behalf of the  appellant.   The  sponsor,  the  appellant's
    husband, Fahim Ullah Saadat, a British citizen, said in  evidence  that
    he and the appellant married on 6 November 2014  in  Afghanistan.   The
    sponsor then returned alone to the UK.  He visited Ireland  on  several
    occasions after his marriage and the appellant made a visa  application
    to enter  Ireland  which  was  granted  in  March  2015.   The  sponsor
    subsequently travelled to Afghanistan and he and the appellant  entered
    Ireland on 13 April 2015.

 6. The appellant's account continued that he and the appellant lived  with
    friends until August 2015 when they moved to a  rented  apartment.   In
    August 2015 the sponsor began working for Farham Anwar Tasty  Spice  in
    Roscrea in County Tipperary. The FtJ  noted  at  this  point  that  the
    respondent  did  not  accept  that  that  employment  was  genuine   or
    effective.

 7. The appellant became pregnant and because  of  complications  with  the
    pregnancy they decided to return to the UK  to  live  with  friends  in
    Derby so that she could  access  support  from  other  members  of  the
    sponsor's family.  They had a child born on 31 October  2015  and  they
    all remained in the  UK  until  January  2016  when  they  returned  to
    Ireland.  The appellant found it difficult to settle in Ireland and  so
    they returned to the UK in March 2016.

 8. In her "Conclusions and Findings" the FtJ said at [19] that  she  found
    the evidence given by the sponsor to be inconsistent with some  of  the
    documentation in the appellant's bundle.  Further, she  said  that  she
    did not find the reasons given by the sponsor as to why he relocated to
    Ireland to be credible.  At [20] the FtJ noted that the  appellant  had
    said in her application that her husband had worked 20 hours a week for
    Tasty Spice in Roscrea from 15 August 2015 to 15 March 2016  but  other
    documents showed that the appellant and sponsor returned to the  UK  on
    10 March 2016.  In addition, the sponsor returned  to  the  UK  between
    October 2015 and January 2016.

 9. The FtJ concluded that there was no "cogent  evidence"  before  her  to
    confirm that the sponsor was employed as claimed.   She  said  at  [21]
    that there was no letter from the sponsor's  employer  to  confirm  the
    hours worked or pay received, or  any  documents  from  the  Irish  tax
    authorities.  The FtJ thus concluded that she was  not  satisfied  that
    the sponsor was  exercising  Treaty  rights  as  a  worker  in  Ireland
    immediately before returning to the UK.

10. At [23] she said that documents in the  appellant's  bundle,  including
    medical letters and a tenancy  agreement  for  an  address  in  Roscrea
    (apartment 8), confirmed that  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  lived
    together at two addresses in Ireland from 13 April "2013"  until  March
    2016 except for between October 2015 and January 2016 when  they  lived
    in Derby.  She thus concluded that the appellant and the sponsor  lived
    together in Ireland during "this period".

11. She next turned to consider whether the  appellant  and  the  sponsor's
    residence in Ireland was genuine.  The FtJ  noted  the  sponsor's  oral
    evidence that he visited Ireland on  several  occasions  prior  to  the
    appellant applying for a visa, in order to  find  out  where  the  best
    place would be to set up a business.  However, she concluded that there
    was no cogent evidence before her that the sponsor made  any  enquiries
    as to setting up a business in Ireland, either before or whilst he  was
    living in Ireland.

12. Next, she referred at [26] to the sponsor's main  residence  as  having
    been in Derby when he went to Afghanistan  to  take  the  appellant  to
    Ireland in April 2015.  Although the sponsor said that he  had  visited
    Ireland on several occasions before going there in April 2015,  he  had
    not secured employment or a property in  which  he  and  the  appellant
    could live.

13. In her application the appellant had said that she and the sponsor  had
    lived together at apartment 8 from 13 April 2015 to 10 March  2016  but
    that information was inconsistent with the sponsor's oral evidence  and
    with the documents in the appellant's bundle.  At [28] she referred  to
    documents, including a doctor's registration  letter,  which  confirmed
    that from April 2015 to August 2015 the appellant and the sponsor lived
    at [ ~ ] in County Cavan.  The sponsor had confirmed in  evidence  that
    this was a friend's address where he and the appellant lived when  they
    first arrived in Ireland.  She further noted that  in  the  appellant's
    bundle there was a tenancy agreement  for  apartment  8  which  clearly
    stated that that tenancy commenced on 20 August 2015.

14. At [30] the FtJ noted that their child was born on 31 October  2015  in
    Derby but the appellant and the sponsor did not return to Ireland until
    January 2016.  During that time they lived at [ ~ Street] in Derby  and
    on returning to the UK in March 2016 they moved into [ ~ Street].

15. At [31] the FtJ concluded that having considered all the  evidence  she
    found that the centre  of  the  sponsor's  life  never  transferred  to
    Ireland.  The accommodations in which the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    lived in Ireland were both of a temporary nature.  She said that within
    a few weeks of taking the  tenancy  of  apartment  8  in  Roscrea,  the
    sponsor and the appellant were living in Derby where they continued  to
    live for a period of over three months and to an address to which  they
    returned in March 2016.

16. She went on to conclude that there was no cogent  evidence  before  her
    that the sponsor and the appellant made any steps to integrate with the
    local community in Ireland.  They had lived together in Ireland  for  a
    period of some eight months but she found that  the  evidence  did  not
    persuade her that there  was  any  intention  to  live  permanently  in
    Ireland.

    The Grounds and Submissions

17. The grounds challenging the FtJ's decision  assert  that  the  FtJ  had
    failed  to  refer  to  any  documentation  that  was  alleged   to   be
    inconsistent with the  sponsor's  oral  evidence,  asserting  that  the
    sponsor gave clear and truthful evidence in line with  the  documentary
    evidence.  It is argued that the FtJ had provided "no justification" as
    to what part of the sponsor's reasons for relocating  to  Ireland  were
    not credible.

18. The grounds refer to the sponsor's witness statements at [5]-[7] to the
    effect that in his opinion there were too many Afghani food  places  in
    the UK in comparison to  Ireland  and  that  as  he  had  had  lots  of
    experience  in  the  food  business  he  believed  there  was  a   good
    possibility of him setting up his own business in Ireland.

19. Furthermore, the sponsor had given very clear reasons for his  move  to
    Ireland, including that he had some ï¿½44,000 in savings, long experience
    in the catering business and he had visited Ireland prior to moving.

20. Although the FtJ had said that there was no letter from  the  sponsor's
    employer, there was in fact such a letter before the FtJ.  In addition,
    the "appellant" had a residence card issued by  the  Irish  immigration
    authorities which would only have been issued  in  circumstances  where
    the appellant could provide proof of employment and  exercising  Treaty
    rights.

21. The grounds further argue that the motive for exercising free  movement
    rights was irrelevant so long as the substance of the "Rules" had  been
    complied with.  Merely because the couple had found it hard  to  settle
    in Ireland was not a reason to doubt that the move  was  genuine.   The
    decision in Akrich [2003] EUECJ C-109/01 is  cited.   Furthermore,  the
    grounds argue that a period of residence of at least three  months  was
    sufficient, relying on the decision in O  v  Minister  voor  Immigratie
    [2014] EUECJ C-456/12.

22. In his submissions Mr Ali relied on the grounds.  He pointed  out  that
    the FtJ had made a mistake at [23] where she said  that  the  appellant
    and the sponsor had lived together at two addresses in Ireland from  13
    April 2013, whereas it should be 13 April 2015.

23. In relation to the employer's letter (from Tasty  Spice)  and  the  FtJ
    having said at [21]  that  there  was  no  employer's  letter,  Mr  Ali
    referred to a document at page  14  of  a  bundle,  although  Mr  Mills
    suggested that that was not in the documents before the FtJ because  it
    was in a bundle of documents submitted with the notice of appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal.

24. Mr Ali further submitted that in any event the decision  letter  refers
    to the evidence of tax that was provided in support of the application.
     That was further basis for concluding that the FtJ  was  in  error  at
    [21] in relation to the sponsor's employment with Tasty  Spice  because
    there  was  evidence  before  the  respondent  from   the   Irish   tax
    authorities.

25. The appellant's witness statement at [5]-[7] gave reasons as to why the
    sponsor decided to settle in  Ireland  in  terms  of  opening  his  own
    business.  The FtJ  had  not  indicated  why  those  reasons  were  not
    credible.  The application form refers to the appellant having returned
    to the UK on 10 March 2016. He was paid until 12 March and his employer
    allowed him to leave five days early.  The sponsor had said at [11]  of
    his witness statement that he was lucky enough to  start  making  money
    immediately.  At [9] he refers to having secured a tenancy and an offer
    of employment and that the employment would give  him  valuable  first-
    hand experience of working in a food place in Ireland.

26. Mr Mills submitted that the FtJ was entitled to take into  account  the
    discrepancy in the evidence at [20] in terms of there being five  days'
    difference between what was said in  the  application  form  about  the
    duration of the sponsor's employment with  Tasty  Spice  (to  15  March
    2016) yet other documents stating that they returned to the  UK  on  10
    March 2016.  Furthermore, between October 2015 and  January  2016  they
    lived in Derby.

27. Mr Mills acknowledged that it was accepted in the decision letter  that
    Irish tax documents had been provided.  However, the point was that the
    FtJ had concluded that their residence was not  genuine.   The  sponsor
    had married a woman from Afghanistan but he was not earning  enough  to
    meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.    The
    residence needed to be genuine.

28. In addition, when the baby was due they returned to the  UK.   If  they
    had genuinely transferred the centre of their  lives  to  Ireland  they
    would have had the baby there.  They returned to a  property  that  the
    sponsor had in the UK and in March 2016 returned to  the  UK  never  to
    return to Ireland.

29. The issue was not just whether the sponsor was working.  His employment
    was not the most significant factor.  Although he  referred  to  having
    some savings there  is  no  evidence  of  any  enquiries  made  by  the
    appellant in relation to setting up a business in Ireland, as  the  FtJ
    had said.

30. In relation to the employer's letter from Tasty Spice, that  refers  to
    the sponsor being an employee and not a franchisee.  Even if there  was
    a factual error in the FtJ's decision in  relation  to  the  employer's
    letter, it was not significant.

31. In his reply, Mr Ali submitted that the savings that the sponsor had of
    ï¿½44,000 was more than enough to meet the requirements of the Rules.  In
    addition, the sponsor had clearly stated that when he moved to  Ireland
    he lived with a friend for the first few months.

32. The appellant explained in his witness statement why they moved back to
    England for the birth of the child (needing female friends  and  family
    around her, and so forth).

    Assessment and Conclusions

33. Mr Ali was not clear in his  submissions  as  to  what  documents  were
    before the FtJ.  On the Tribunal's file there is a 25-page faxed bundle
    with a fax date of 22 February  2018.   It  is  paginated  and  indexed
    although the witness statements from the appellant and the sponsor  are
    copied in such a way that parts of one  statement  are  mixed  up  with
    parts of the  other.   Nevertheless,  the  Tribunal's  file  does  have
    separate complete copies of  those  witness  statements  which  I  have
    considered.

34. Although Mr Ali sought to rely on a letter from Tasty  Spice  dated  10
    February 2016 in relation to employment that was referred to by the FtJ
    as Farhan Anwar, it seems to me that Mr Mills was correct to point  out
    that that letter was contained in a bundle of  documents  submitted  in
    support of the appeal against the FtJ's decision.  It is  not  apparent
    that it was amongst the documents that was put before the FtJ and  thus
    she was right to state at [21] that there was  no  letter  from  Farhan
    Anwar to support the sponsor's claim that he was  employed  by  him  at
    Tasty Spice.  Thus, in that respect the FtJ was correct to  state  that
    there was no employer's letter to  confirm  the  hours  worked  or  pay
    received.  It cannot have been an error of law  for  the  FtJ  to  have
    failed to have regard to a document that was not put before her.

35. The FtJ also said that there were  no  documents  from  the  Irish  tax
    authorities.   At  [22]  she  concluded  that  the  appellant  had  not
    established that her husband was exercising Treaty rights as  a  worker
    in Ireland immediately before returning to the United Kingdom.

36. However, it does seem to me that Mr Ali was  correct  in  pointing  out
    that the decision letter  dated  21  February  2017  accepts  that  the
    sponsor was in employment in Ireland.  Page 2 of  the  decision  letter
    states as follows:

         "It is accepted that your British citizen sponsor is  a  'qualified
         person' in the UK in accordance with regulations 6 and 9(7).   This
         is because tax evidence of your  employment  in  Ireland  has  been
         supplied to suggest you worked between 29 May  2015  and  15  March
         2016."

    The FtJ did not refer to that part of the decision letter although that
    may be because the decision letter was also incomplete, at least in the
    copy of the respondent's bundle that was before  the  FtJ.   There  was
    however, a complete faxed copy on the Tribunal's file.

37. Nevertheless, although Mr Ali quite rightly points to the  respondent's
    decision letter as accepting that there was evidence of  employment  in
    Ireland, the dates given in the decision letter (29 May  2015-15  March
    2016) are inconsistent  with  the  sponsor's  evidence  which  the  FtJ
    recorded at [13] as being that he started working for Tasty Spice  from
    August 2015.  The appellant did not suggest before the FtJ  that  there
    was other employment in Ireland and  the  sponsor's  witness  statement
    does not mention other employment than that to  which  he  referred  in
    oral evidence as starting in August 2015.  His witness  statement  does
    say that when he and the appellant went to Ireland  in  April  2015  he
    started making money immediately but there is no indication of  how  he
    was able to do so or what his employment was.

38. Whilst therefore, the FtJ was wrong not to take into  account  what  is
    said in the decision letter about tax evidence  showing  the  sponsor's
    employment between 29 May 2015 and 15 March 2016, I  do  not  see  that
    that error  was  significant  in  the  context  of  the  FtJ's  overall
    findings, in particular in terms of the genuineness of the residence in
    Ireland apart from as regards employment.   Furthermore,  even  if  the
    Tasty Spice letter of 10 February 2016 was before the FtJ, which  I  do
    not accept, the FtJ's failure to have taken it into  account  is  again
    not significant in circumstances where that letter also states that the
    sponsor was employed on a full-time and permanent basis from 15  August
    2015, not 29 May 2015, as accepted by the respondent  in  the  decision
    letter.

39. The error in [23] whereby the FtJ  said  that  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor lived together at two addresses in Ireland from 13 April  2013,
    whereas it should be 13 April 2015, is not material.  That is plainly a
    slip of the pen because there are repeated references  to  the  correct
    date in the FtJ's decision.

40. Otherwise, I do not accept that the FtJ  failed  to  give  reasons  for
    finding  that  the  evidence  of  the  sponsor  was  inconsistent  with
    documentation in the appellant's bundle.  I have summarised  the  FtJ's
    decision and it is clear from that summary that she did explain how the
    sponsor's evidence was inconsistent.  Thus, at [20] the FtJ  said  that
    in her application the appellant had said that the  sponsor  worked  20
    hours a week for Tasty Spice from 15 August  2015  to  15  March  2016.
    However, she pointed out that other documents state that the  appellant
    and sponsor returned to the UK on  10  March  2016.   Furthermore,  the
    sponsor returned to the UK between October 2015 and January 2016.  That
    was the sponsor's evidence recorded at [16], namely  that  their  child
    was born on 31 October 2015 and that they  remained  in  the  UK  until
    January 2016.  In those circumstances the sponsor could not  have  been
    working in Ireland throughout the period 15 August  2015  to  15  March
    2016.  For two or three months of that period he and the appellant were
    in the UK.

41. In addition, the FtJ was entitled to find that  there  was  no  "cogent
    evidence" before her to show that the sponsor made any enquiries as  to
    setting up a business in Ireland either before or whilst he was  living
    there.  He said as much in his witness statement but there was  nothing
    to support that assertion.

42. The FtJ was further entitled to  point  out  that  the  sponsor's  main
    residence was still in Derby when he went to Afghanistan  to  take  the
    appellant to Ireland in April 2015.   She  pointed  out  at  [30]  that
    between 31 October 2015 (the birth of their  child)  and  January  2016
    when they returned to Ireland, they lived at [ ~ Street] in Derby,  the
    address they returned to when they again came  back  to  the  UK  three
    months later, in March 2016.

43. At [27] the FtJ referred to the application stating that the  appellant
    and the sponsor lived together at apartment 8 from 13 April 2015 to  10
    March 2016.  She said that that information was inconsistent  with  the
    sponsor's oral evidence and with documents in the  appellant's  bundle.
    Thus, at [29] she referred to the tenancy  agreement  for  apartment  8
    which clearly stated that the tenancy commenced on 20 August 2015,  not
    13 April 2015 as the application form had stated.  In addition, at [28]
    the FtJ  referred  to  documents,  including  a  doctor's  registration
    letter, which stated that from April 2015 to August 2015 they lived  at
    [ ~ ], an address that the sponsor said in oral evidence was a friend's
    address that they stayed in when they first arrived in Ireland.   Again
    however, that was inconsistent with what was on the application form as
    pointed out by the FtJ.

44. The FtJ was entitled to state at [32] that the accommodation  in  which
    they lived in Ireland (and she did accept that they  lived  together  -
    see [23]) was temporary in nature.  It was significant  that  within  a
    few weeks of taking the tenancy of apartment 8 on 20 August 2015  they
    were  living  in  Derby  (from  October  2015).   Likewise,  that  they
    continued to live there for over three months  and  returned  there  in
    March 2016.

45. It cannot be said that the FtJ ignored what  was  advanced  as  to  the
    reasons for their moving back to England, namely complications with the
    pregnancy and the appellant needing support from friends and members of
    the sponsor's family in Derby.  She referred to this at [15].

46. There was a lack of evidence before the FtJ that the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant made any steps to  integrate  with  the  local  community  in
    Ireland, a matter that the FtJ referred to at [33].  Similarly,  whilst
    length of residence is not determinative,  it  is  a  factor  that  may
    plainly be relevant.  The FtJ was entitled to point out  at  [34]  that
    the appellant and the sponsor lived together in Ireland for a period of
    some eight months, and in the light of her findings was  not  persuaded
    that they had intended to live permanently in Ireland.

47. Under reg 9(2)(c) in order for  the  appellant  to  be  entitled  to  a
    residence card as though the sponsor  were  a  British  citizen,  their
    residence in the EEA  State,  (in  this  case  Ireland)  needed  to  be
    "genuine".

48. Reg 9(3) has a non-exhaustive list of factors that are relevant in that
    context.  It reads as follows:

         "9.- (3) Factors relevant to whether residence in the EEA State  is
                  or was genuine include-

                  (a)  whether the centre of BC's life  transferred  to  the
                      EEA State;

                  (b)  the length of F and BC's joint residence in  the  EEA
                      State;

                  (c)   the  nature  and  quality  of   the   F   and   BC's
                      accommodation in the EEA State, and whether it is  or
                      was BC's principal residence;

                  (d)  the degree of F  and  BC's  integration  in  the  EEA
                      State;

                  (e)  whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with  BC
                      was in the EEA State."

49. It is evident from the FtJ's decision that she was not  satisfied  that
    it  was  established  that  the  centre  of  the  sponsor's  life   had
    transferred to Ireland.  She took into account, as she was entitled  to
    do, the length of their joint residence in Ireland and  the  degree  of
    their integration.

50. Although Mr Mills implied that reg 9(4) was in play here (residence  in
    Ireland as a means of circumventing immigration laws) in terms  of  his
    stating that the sponsor was not earning enough to meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, the FtJ did not express any such
    conclusion and it is not a matter which I need to decide  in  terms  of
    whether the FtJ made any error of law requiring her decision to be  set
    aside.

51. To summarise, whilst the FtJ ought to have taken into account what  was
    said in the decision letter about evidence of the sponsor's  employment
    in Ireland, I am not satisfied that her failure to have done so amounts
    to an error of law, or an error of law which requires her  decision  to
    be set aside.  For the reasons I have explained, any such  error  could
    not have affected the outcome of the appeal.  Accordingly, the decision
    of the FtJ is to stand.

    Decision

52. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.   Its  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    therefore stands.
