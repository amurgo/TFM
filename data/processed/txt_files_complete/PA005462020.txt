For the Appellants:    Mr Karnik, Halliday Reeves Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is an Iraqi Kurd born in 1991. His protection appeal  was
    dismissed on the 8th April  2020  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Alis). The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by Upper Tribunal
    Judge Rintoul on the 22nd July 2020.

 2. Before me the parties are in agreement that the decision of Judge  Alis
    is flawed for material error of law and that it must be set aside,  the
    Respondent's consent being expressed in a 'Rule 24  response'  prepared
    by Senior Presenting Officer Mr D Clarke on the 29th October 2020.

 3. The errors of law agreed by Mr Clarke are:

      i)    Mistake of fact.  At its �42 the First-tier Tribunal rejects the
         Appellant's claim to have been shot at and attacked because he  was
         "left with no  scarring".  In  fact  the  Appellant  has  extensive
         scarring.

     ii) Failure to apply the Surendran guidelines. There was no PO  present
         at the First-tier Tribunal hearing. As such it was incumbent on the
         Tribunal to put matters of concern to the Appellant to give him  an
         opportunity to address the issue raised.  The  Secretary  of  State
         accepts, particularly with reference to the reasoning  at  �35  and
         �42, that this was not done, and accordingly that the Appellant did
         not have a fair hearing.

 4. In light of her concession at (ii) above the Secretary of State invites
    the Tribunal to remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal so that the
    appeal may be heard de novo.  For the Appellant Mr Karnik  agreed  that
    this was the appropriate course.

    Anonymity Order

 5. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

      Decision

 6. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    it is set aside.

 7. The decision in the appeal will be remade following a de  novo  hearing
    in the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. There is an order for anonymity.
