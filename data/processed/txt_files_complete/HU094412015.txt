                                             Appellant in the Upper Tribunal

Representation:
For the Claimant:      Miss G. Patel (Counsel)
For the Secretary of State:   Mr  McVeety  (Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Lloyd promulgated on the 16th May  2017  in  which
      she allowed the Claimant's appeal against  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision to refuse him Entry Clearance as a spouse , in order to  join
      his Sponsor and wife [PB], on Human Rights grounds  under  Article  8.
      For the purposes of clarity, given  that  this  is  the  Secretary  of
      State's appeal, I will refer to the Secretary of State  as  being  the
      Secretary of State and to Mr M. A. as being the Claimant.

   2. Within the Grounds of Appeal it is  argued  firstly,  that  the  Judge
      materially erred in law in finding that  a  discrepancy  in  the  wage
      slips of 86 pence was so  small  that  she  considered  it  to  be  de
      minimis.  It is argued that following the Upper Tribunal case of  Chau
      Le (Immigration Rules - de minimis principle) [2016]  UKUT  186,  that
      the  principle  has  no  application  in  the  construction   of   the
      Immigration Rules and  that  the  Judge  erred  in  finding  that  the
      provisions of Appendix FM-SE were satisfied, as the wage slips did not
      correspondence to the entries in the  bank  statements  and  that  the
      explanation for which is immaterial.

   3. It is argued in the second ground that the Judge  erred  in  accepting
      the so-called explanations for the fact that the wage slips  and  bank
      statements did not correspond and that the  Judge  has  speculated  in
      making such a finding unsupported by evidence and that it was not open
      to the Judge to second-guess the reason for the discrepancy.

   4. Permission to appeal has been granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Grimmett on the 29th November 2017 who found that it was arguable that
      the  Judge  made  an  error  when  concluding   that   the   financial
      requirements were  met  when  there  were  discrepancies  between  the
      Sponsor's wage slips  and  the  actual  receipts  shown  in  the  bank
      statements and where there had been no  explanation  provided  by  the
      employer and that it was also arguable that the de  minimis  principle
      did not apply to such an appeal.

   5. In his submissions to the Upper Tribunal,  Mr  McVeety,  in  complying
      with his duty to the court, argued that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      had erred in finding that the provisions of the Immigration Rules were
      met in circumstances where the wage slips did not correspond with  the
      payments in to the bank account, but quite properly conceded  that  as
      this was an appeal on Human Rights grounds  under  Article  8,  rather
      than an appeal under the Immigration Rules, in circumstances where the
      Judge did accept that the payments into  the  bank  account  were  the
      Sponsor's wage , that the judge would have reached the same conclusion
      in any event on the Human Rights issue. Despite the  discrepancies  in
      the payments, the Judge found that there was simply a  discrepancy  of
      86 pence in the payment in December 2014 the most  likely  explanation
      which was it had been rounded up by the employer to the nearest pound.
      In respect of the wage slips  for  April  and  May  showing  that  the
      Sponsor was paid a net monthly pay of �1,335.58, and the  Sponsor  had
      paid into the account �1,324.14 for both months had been a discrepancy
      of �11.44 for both months, which the Judge considered was likely to be
      a mistake on the part of the employer in a failure to realise that her
      tax position had changed and the employer had  continued  to  pay  her
      salary based upon the calculation of the previous  year's  tax.  Given
      those findings, Mr McVeety conceded that in reality, the  Judge  would
      have reached the same conclusion in respect of the Article 8 claim  in
      any event.  Mr McVeety quite properly conceded that as the appeal  was
      an appeal on Article 8 grounds, given that the Judge had accepted that
      the payments were payments into the Sponsor's account  in  respect  of
      her salary, that although the Judge had erred, he  conceded  that  the
      result would have been the same in any event and  that  therefore  the
      error was not material.  In making such a concession, Mr McVeety quite
      properly complied with his duty to the court.

   6. Miss Patel stated that as the Secretary of State had now conceded that
      there was no material error, she did not need to reply  on  behalf  of
      the Claimant.

   7. I do find for the purposes of Appendix FM-SE, that there does have  to
      be evidence of the  payment  of  the  Sponsor's  salary  into  a  bank
      account, for the months corresponding to the wage slips that have been
      provided.  Indeed, as Mr  McVeety  quite  properly  stated,  the  Rule
      itself provides that there has to  be  evidence  of  payment  of  "the
      salary" into the account, and not simply  a  part  of  it,  or  a  sum
      different from the salary.  However, Judge Lloyd had  the  benefit  of
      hearing evidence from the Sponsor and accepted that  the  Sponsor  was
      illiterate and uneducated and had not therefore checked to ensure that
      her wages matched her payslip, but that she simply paid the amount she
      was given by her employer straightaway into the bank and had not taken
      any money out before she had done so.  She was entitled  therefore  to
      find, having heard from the Sponsor that she had paid her salary  into
      the bank account, even though the amount paid  into  the  account  for
      December 2014 was 86 pence more than on the wage slip.

   8. She was also entitled to find the  most  likely  explanation  for  the
      difference between the wage slips and the payment for  April  and  May
      2015 had been the fact that the  employer  had  continued  paying  her
      salary on the calculation of the previous tax year,  even  though  she
      had not heard specifically from the employer in  that  regard.   Judge
      Lloyd clearly had to do the best that she could on the evidence before
      her, and accepted that this was in fact  the  Sponsor's  salary  being
      paid into her account.  It is not a material error of law for a  Judge
      to find a Sponsor credible.

   9. However, I do agree with Mr  McVeety  that  as  far  as  the  specific
      wording of Appendix FM-SE is concerned, that it does require that  the
      salary is paid into the bank account, rather than simply part of it or
      a different sum, and that  therefore  technically  the  provisions  of
      Appendix FM-SE are not met,  but  in  circumstances  where  the  Judge
      clearly did accept that this was the payment of her  salary  into  the
      bank account, that the  Judge  would  have  found  that  this  was  an
      exceptional or compelling circumstance such as to justify Leave  being
      granted outside of the Immigration Rules under Article 8 in any event,
      and would have reached exactly the same conclusion, in respect of  the
      decision being a disproportionate  interference  with  the  Claimant's
      Human Rights under Article 8 and that she would have still allowed the
      appeal on Human Rights grounds.  I therefore agree with  Mr  McVeety's
      concession that in fact there is no material  error  of  law  in  this
      case, as the  result  would  have  been  the  same  irrespective,  and
      therefore I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lloyd does not contain a  material
error of law and is maintained.

First-tier Tribunal Judge Lloyd thought it was appropriate for an  anonymity
decision to be made in this case, given that the Claimant did have  2  young
children who are British citizens.  In such circumstances, I similarly  make
an  Anonymity  Order.   Unless  and  until  a  Tribunal  or  court   directs
otherwise,  the  Claimant  is  granted  anonymity.   No  report   of   these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
family.  This direction applies both to the Claimant and  to  the  Secretary
of State.  Failure to comply with this direction could lead to  contempt  of
court proceedings.

Signed
