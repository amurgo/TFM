                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Saini, Counsel instructed by Universal
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's  appeal  against  a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin, who had  allowed  Mr  Haque's  appeal
    against her  decision  refusing  him  leave  to  enter.   For  ease  of
    reference, throughout this determination I shall  refer  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, who was  the  original  respondent,  as  "the  Entry
    Clearance Officer" and to Mr Haque, who was the original appellant,  as
    "the claimant".

 2. The claimant married the sponsor, Ms Chowdhury, in April 2008 and  they
    have a child who is now aged 6.  Ms Chowdhury is a British citizen  and
    has been so since birth.  The claimant is  a  national  of  Bangladesh.
    They married in Bangladesh and it is not clear from the papers  why  it
    was that when the sponsor returned to this country she  did  not  bring
    her son with her but as a result the present situation  is  that  while
    the sponsor, who as I have said is a British  citizen,  is  living  and
    working in this country, her husband and her  son,  who  is  a  British
    citizen, remain in Bangladesh.  There is insufficient  evidence  before
    the Tribunal on which any finding  could  be  made  at  this  stage  on
    Article 8 grounds although it may be that at a future date an Article 8
    claim could be made.

 3. The sponsor has had a number of jobs and one of them  is  with  a  firm
    called Panache Outerwear where she has been employed since  April  2013
    and from which she receives an income of around �15,000 per year.   She
    also has worked for the Tilbury Post Office from May to September  2013
    and since October 2013 she has worked for McDonald's.  It appears  from
    the evidence before me quite clear that as  at  the  present  time  her
    income is certainly above the threshold necessary to allow the claimant
    entry clearance because the threshold is and has been at  all  material
    times �18,600 and her combined  earnings  from  Panache  Outerwear  and
    McDonald's is a little over �20,000.

 4. On 15 October 2013 the claimant  submitted  an  application  for  entry
    clearance relying on the evidence that the sponsor was  working  as  an
    assistant quality controller with Panache Outerwear in support of which
    various payslips were submitted.  The claimant also  relied  on  income
    which the sponsor was said to be earning from the Tilbury  Post  Office
    amounting to a little under �3,600  per  year.   It  appears  that  the
    income which it was said in that application the  sponsor  was  earning
    totalled  �18,588  which  itself  is  slightly  below   the   necessary
    threshold.

 5. The application was refused by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  for  two
    reasons.   The  first  reason  given  was  that  apparently  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer had received information suggesting that the  sponsor
    was no longer employed by Panache Outerwear and if this was correct  as
    the Entry Clearance Officer believed  it  followed  that  the  payslips
    showing  that  she  was  still  employed  must  have  been  false;  the
    application was accordingly refused because  it  was  said  that  false
    documents had been submitted for the purpose  of  the  application.   I
    deal with this briefly below.

 6. The other reason why the application was refused was because  not  only
    was the income claimed to be that of the sponsor  below  the  necessary
    threshold but also the evidential requirements under Appendix FM-SE had
    not been satisfied.  The relevant requirements are that the sponsor  in
    this case would have been required to demonstrate  that  prior  to  the
    date of application she could show six months of payslips in respect of
    each employment relied upon.   Not  only  did  the  evidence  from  the
    Tilbury Post Office not satisfy this requirement but it  did  not  even
    set out what her income actually was.  It is  not  suggested  that  the
    evidential requirements under Appendix FM-SE were actually satisfied.

 7. In the course of  the  refusal  letter,  however,  although  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer did state that the evidential  requirements  had  not
    been satisfied the following was also contained:

         "However, no final determination has been made at this stage as  to
         whether you meet the income  threshold  and/or  related  evidential
         requirements.  This is because the courts have not yet decided  the
         outcome of the Secretary of State's appeal in a legal challenge  to
         the income threshold requirement.  More information about  this  is
         set out on the Home Office website".

    This is a reference to a challenge by the  Secretary  of  State,  which
    ultimately succeeded, to a decision of the  former  President  of  this
    Tribunal, Mr Justice Blake, in MM (Lebanon).  The letter then continues
    as follows:

         "If you appeal against this refusal decision, a final determination
         as  to  whether  you  meet  the  income  threshold  and/or  related
         evidential requirements under the Rules may  be  made  at  a  later
         stage.  In making any such determination account would be taken  of
         any  further  information  or  document(s)  regarding  the   income
         threshold and/or related evidential requirements which you enclosed
         with your appeal".

 8. No further determination was in fact  made  and  it  appears  from  the
    papers within the file that although there was what is described as  "a
    cursory review" by an  Entry  Clearance  Manager  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not prepared to concede the  appeal  and  the  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance was maintained.

 9. The claimant appealed against the decision refusing him entry clearance
    and his appeal  was  heard  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Colvin
    sitting at Taylor House on 11 March 2015.  In a decision dated 1  April
    2015 and promulgated  shortly  thereafter,  Judge  Colvin  allowed  the
    appeal.  Her reasons for allowing the appeal included  relying  on  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's statements within the refusal letter set  out
    above, to the effect that a  final  determination  as  to  whether  the
    claimant met the income threshold and/or evidential requirements  under
    the Rules may be made at a later stage and  that  in  making  any  such
    determination further account would be taken of any further information
    or documents enclosed with his appeal.

10.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  now  appeals  against  this  decision,
    permission to do so having been granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Brunnen on 3 June 2015.

11. Before me  on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Mr  Wilding
    submitted that the judge was not entitled to disregard  the  evidential
    requirements  under  Appendix  FM-SE.   Although  Section  85  of   the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 allowed a  court  to  take  account  of
    evidence submitted  after  the  decision  which  related  back  to  the
    decision in question this had no bearing on the evidential requirements
    under Appendix FM-SE which were mandatory.  Before an application could
    be granted there was a requirement to provide the evidence in the  form
    specified and in this case what was  required  was  evidence  that  the
    sponsor had had income from the particular employments for a period  of
    six months prior to the date of the application.

12. I should state at this point that Judge Colvin had found as a fact (and
    the evidence in support of this finding is very  clear  indeed  on  the
    papers) that the suggestion  that  the  sponsor  may  have  ceased  her
    employment with Panache Outerwear was unfounded.   There  was  evidence
    before the judge which is before this  Tribunal  also  which  makes  it
    quite clear that the employment of the sponsor with  this  company  has
    been a continuous one since 2013 and on behalf of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer Mr Wilding did not seek to suggest otherwise.  It would  appear
    from the evidence contained within the file  that  on  this  point  the
    Entry Clearance Officer simply made a mistake.

13. However, even though the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  not  in  fact
    reconsider the decision that had been made, as Mr Wilding  pointed  out
    the basis on which the paragraphs had been added to the refusal  letter
    was that this would bite if and to the extent that  the  Higher  Courts
    upheld the decision which had  been  made  in  MM  (Lebanon)  which  if
    correct would mean that in certain circumstances an income  lower  than
    that specified in Appendix FM-SE might be sufficient.  In the event the
    Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of State's  appeal  and  so  this
    point did not arise.

14. On behalf of the claimant Mr Saini's primary submission was that as the
    Entry Clearance Officer had indicated that he may reconsider he  should
    have done so and that this indication effectively  meant  that  he  has
    agreed  to  waive  the  specific  requirements   of   Appendix   FM-SE.
    Regrettably I am unable to accept this submission.  While it  is  right
    that the Entry Clearance Officer certainly has a discretion in  certain
    circumstances to grant entry clearance outside the Rules  it  is  clear
    from the refusal letter that the Entry Clearance Officer was not saying
    that he would dispense with the requirements under the  Rules.   Indeed
    it is stated specifically within the letter that the  point  was  being
    taken that "you have failed to provide the specified documents of  your
    sponsor's  employment  ...  [which]  documents  are  specified  ...  in
    Appendix FM-SE and must be provided".

15. Accordingly in my judgment and as I say regrettably  on  the  facts  of
    this case, there was no proper basis upon which Judge Colvin could have
    allowed the claimant's appeal.  The fact is that the claimant  did  not
    satisfy  the  requirements  under  the  Rules  on  any   basis,   these
    requirements are mandatory, and they had not been specifically  waived.
    As I have already said, there was no evidential  basis  upon  which  an
    Article 8 claim could have succeeded, although I do not doubt that  had
    Mr Saini, who appeared before me, been instructed  at  a  much  earlier
    stage an Article 8 claim may very well have been pursued  and  evidence
    might have been obtainable for this purpose.

16. It follows that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  must  be  set
    aside and this Tribunal must remake the decision dismissing the appeal.
     Before formally making this decision, however, I should  add  that  on
    the evidence which has been considered by this Tribunal it does  appear
    that a further application if made now ought to succeed.  It  is  clear
    from the evidence that the sponsor has now  been  working  for  Panache
    Outerwear for considerably longer than six months  (around  two  years)
    and that she has also now been working for McDonald's for  considerably
    longer than the six month period required under the Rules.  As  I  have
    already noted, her combined income from these employments is  now  over
    �20,000 and indeed from the evidence which is before me it appears that
    her income in the period before the application was made  (even  though
    not evidenced in a way  which  satisfied  the  evidential  requirements
    under the Rules) was even then above  the  level  required.   In  these
    circumstances, especially bearing in mind that the couple have a  young
    son, who is a British citizen, and who ideally ought to be  brought  up
    in a family where both his parents are present, I would hope that if  a
    further application is now made in which  the  evidential  requirements
    are satisfied, this application will be considered very speedily indeed
    as any further delay should be kept to a minimum.

Notice of Decision

I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin  as  containing
a material error of law.

I remake the decision, dismissing the claimant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
