For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. We shall refer to the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Thus, the Secretary of State is once more the Respondent, and
    Miss Ozkaya is the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge R G Walters (the judge), promulgated on 31 October 2016,
    in which he  purported  to  allow  the  Appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 3. The Appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal had been against  the
    Respondent's decision of 8 July  2015,  refusing  her  application  for
    leave to remain with reference to paragraph  298  of  the  Rules.   The
    Appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 17 February 2013 with leave
    to enter until 29 April 2015.  She sought an extension of that leave by
    an in-time  application  made  on  28  April  2015.   The  Respondent's
    decision referred to the fact that whilst the  Appellant's  father  was
    settled in the United Kingdom, her mother only  had  limited  leave  to
    remain  here:  thus,  paragraph  298(i)  was  not  satisfied  and   the
    application fell to be refused.  Article 8 was considered  outside  the
    context of the Rules. In light of the fact that the  Appellant  was  by
    that time an adult, it was deemed that removal  would  not  breach  any
    protected rights.

The judge's decision

 4. The judge commented that in his view it was unclear on what  basis  the
    Appellant had entered the United Kingdom in 2013.  He concluded that it
    was likely that the relevant provision upon which she had been  granted
    entry clearance was paragraph 302 of the Rules, not paragraph 297.  The
    judge then makes reference to the  provisions  of  paragraph  301,  and
    finds that the Appellant's father was indeed present and settled in the
    United Kingdom, and that the Appellant's mother had  limited  leave  to
    enter with a view to settlement (see paragraph 23).  In light  of  this
    and the fact that there was no dispute as to the  satisfaction  of  the
    other provisions of the relevant Rule, the  judge  concluded  that  the
    Appellant met the relevant provisions of paragraph  298(ii).   On  this
    basis he allowed the appeal, as he put it, under the Immigration Rules.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 5. The Respondent's grounds of appeal assert that  the  judge  misdirected
    himself by failing to have any regard to paragraph 298(i) of the Rules.
     It is said that the judge simply failed to  consider  this  particular
    provision.

 6. Permission on this basis was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-
    Hutchinson on 11 April 2017.

The hearing before us

 7. Mr Whitwell relied on the grounds and  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    erred in consideration of the issues as they were put before him,  both
    in respect of the application made by  the  Appellant  and  submissions
    made at the hearing.  It was speculative as to whether or not the judge
    could have arrived  at  the  same  conclusion  if  he  had  pursued  an
    alternative route in respect of the applicable Rule.  Mr Whitwell  also
    pointed out that it was a human rights only appeal  and  therefore  the
    judge was wrong to have purportedly allowed it under the Rules.

 8. Mr Hawkins helpfully clarified a couple of factual matters  for  us  in
    respect of when the entry  clearance  application  was  made.  He  then
    submitted that the judge was  correct  to  have  concluded  that  entry
    clearance was issued on the basis of paragraph 302 of the  Rules  given
    her parents' immigration status at the relevant time.

Decision on error of law

 9. We conclude that there is a  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.

10. The judge may have been entitled to conclude that entry  clearance  was
    indeed issued under paragraph 302 of the Rules, and he clearly  had  in
    mind the relevant status of the Appellant's parents  at  the  time  the
    application was made in 2015.  However,  the  problem  arises  when  he
    concludes at paragraph 26 that all  of  the  relevant  requirements  of
    paragraph 298(ii) were satisfied, and that this effectively led to  the
    outcome of the appeal being allowed.  Unfortunately, the  judge  failed
    to have any regard to the requirements of paragraph 298(i), which is  a
    substantive and conjunctive provision of that particular Rule.  However
    the Appellant's case may or may  not  have  been  put  to  him  at  the
    hearing, in respect of this element of the Rules the judge simply fails
    to engage with it in any way.   In  our  view  this  omission  must  be
    material.

11. We would also note that the judge was wrong to have purportedly allowed
    the appeal under the Rules given that this appeal was governed  by  the
    amended provisions of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
    Act, and that therefore the only ground  of  appeal  available  to  the
    Appellant was in relation to Article 8.

12. In light of the above we set aside the judge's decision.

Remaking the decision

13. In remaking the decision we have had regard to the  evidence  contained
    in  the  Respondent's  bundle,  the  Appellant's  bundle,  indexed  and
    paginated 1-68, and the submissions made to us at the hearing.

14. Mr Hawkins submitted that the Appellant's case fell within the ambit of
    paragraph 298(i)(d) of the Rules, namely that there were  "serious  and
    compelling  family  circumstances"  pertaining   to   the   Appellant's
    situation in the United Kingdom.  These circumstances were, in  effect,
    that whilst her father was settled here and that her mother and  sister
    had limited leave to remain with a view to  settlement,  the  Appellant
    was faced with the prospect of being removed from her family  unit  and
    sent back to Turkey.  It was submitted that the mother and sister would
    in all likelihood be making applications for  settlement  in  the  near
    future.  In respect of the situation in  Turkey,  Mr  Hawkins  accepted
    that the grandmother and her older sister still resided there but  this
    was not fatal to his argument.   He  accepted  that  paragraph  301(ii)
    could not apply to the Appellant because of her age.  It was  submitted
    that if we were not satisfied that the Appellant's case fell within the
    provisions of the Rules we should nonetheless consider  the  Article  8
    claim at large.

15. Mr Whitwell submitted there  were  no  serious  and  compelling  family
    circumstances in this case.   The  Appellant  was  an  adult,  she  was
    working in this country, and could return to  live  with  other  family
    members in Turkey.  There  was  nothing  stopping  any  of  her  family
    members in the United Kingdom from visiting her.

Our findings

16. There has never been any credibility challenge to any of  the  evidence
    in this case.  We have no reason to doubt the reliability of any of the
    evidence before us.  We therefore  find  that  the  Appellant  and  her
    father are credible  and  that  all  of  the  documentary  evidence  is
    reliable.

17. We find that the Appellant applied to enter the United Kingdom when she
    was still a minor and had to wait a considerable period of time  before
    a decision was made  on  that  application.   She  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 17 February 2013 along with her mother and  younger  sister.
    At all material times the  Appellant's  father  has  been  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom.  We find that prior to  the  arrival  in
    the United Kingdom the Appellant was living with her mother and younger
    sister in Turkey.  She was clearly part and parcel of the  family  unit
    at that time.  We find that the Appellant came to  this  country  along
    with her other family members with the express  intention  of  settling
    here in a reunified family unit (her father  of  course  already  being
    resident in this country).

18. We agree with the finding of the judge as regards  the  specific  basis
    upon which the Appellant was granted entry clearance, namely  paragraph
    302, with reference to paragraph 301. In our view,  that  is  the  only
    logical conclusion.

19. The evidence satisfies us that the Appellant has  been  living  in  the
    family home in the United Kingdom from the point of her  arrival  here,
    to date.  We accept that the Appellant has been  working,  although  we
    find that she is  not  wholly  financially  independent.   She  clearly
    relies at least on accommodation provided to her by  her  parents.   We
    find that the  Appellant's  mother  and  younger  sister  were  granted
    limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom at the same time  as  the
    Appellant was refused indefinite leave  to  remain.   For  some  reason
    which remains unclear, the  Appellant's  application  was  made  on  an
    erroneous basis, namely for indefinite leave to  remain,  when  it  was
    quite apparent that her mother only had limited  leave  to  remain  and
    therefore paragraph 298(i) of the Rules could not be satisfied.  If  at
    that time the Appellant had applied for limited  leave  to  remain  she
    would very probably not be in the situation she how finds herself.

20. Whilst we acknowledge that the Appellant's mother and sister  have  not
    yet made applications for settlement, it is clear that they will do  so
    in the near future. The reality is  that  such  applications  would  be
    likely to succeed.

21. We find that the Appellant has  a  grandmother  and  an  older  married
    sister living in Turkey.  There is very  little  evidence  about  their
    particular circumstances.  There is no indication  that  the  Appellant
    had lived with either of these family members by herself at any time in
    the past.

Our conclusions

22. This is a human rights only appeal, and therefore our consideration  of
    the issues must involve an overall assessment under Article 8.

23. We conclude that there is in fact family life as between the  Appellant
    and the rest of her immediate family residing in  the  United  Kingdom.
    In so concluding we have regard to a series of  cases  considering  the
    effect of the well-known principles  relating  to  adult  children  and
    family life set out in Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31.  In  particular  we
    direct ourselves to the cases of Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320,  Butt  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 184, and Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) [2012]
    UKUT 00160 (IAC), the overall effect of which is that where family life
    is enjoyed prior to the attainment of  majority,  such  life  will  not
    automatically cease when a child becomes an adult. Every case is highly
    fact-sensitive.

24. In this case we have found that the Appellant  lived  with  her  family
    members whilst in Turkey and that her and her  mother  and  her  sister
    came to the United Kingdom  together  with  the  express  intention  of
    continuing to reside together after arrival.  This they have done.  The
    Appellant has not, in our view, formed an independent life. She may  be
    working  but  she  is  not  financially  independent   and   is   still
    significantly emotionally attached to her parents.  She remains a young
    adult and, in the context of the cases already  referred  to,  we  find
    that on balance sufficient connections continue  so  as  to  justify  a
    finding that family life is engaged.

25. The Appellant's removal would clearly constitute a sufficiently serious
    interference with that family life.

26. The Respondent's decision is in accordance with the law and  pursues  a
    legitimate aim, namely  the  need  to  maintain  effective  immigration
    control.

27. We turn to the issue  of  proportionality.   In  so  doing  we  address
    initially the provisions of paragraph 298(i)(d).  In  our  view  (by  a
    narrow margin) it cannot be said  there  are  "serious  and  compelling
    family circumstances" (underlining added) in this case.   We  interpret
    the phrase as including two elements, both of which must be present  in
    order for the sub-paragraph to be met. If it were otherwise, either the
    term "serious" or "compelling" would be superfluous.

28. Here, whilst we are clear that compelling circumstances exist (as  will
    be set out below), there is not the added element  of  serious  factors
    such as ill-health, a particularly difficult or traumatic  history,  or
    the prospect of dire living conditions should the Appellant  return  to
    Turkey. In light of this, the  Appellant  does  not  satisfy  paragraph
    298(i)(d) of the Rules.

29. The satisfaction or otherwise of the Rules represents an important, but
    not of course determinative,  aspect  of  the  overall  proportionality
    assessment.

30. Our conclusion that there are compelling family circumstances  in  this
    case is based upon the following matters. The Appellant  was  always  a
    part of the family unit whilst they resided in  Turkey.   There  was  a
    perfectly legitimate attempt at migration  to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    order to join the father who was already here on a settled  basis.   At
    the time the application for entry clearance was made the Appellant was
    of course still a child.  The significant delay by  the  Respondent  in
    making the decision on the application did nothing to help matters.

31. Eventually, the Appellant arrived in this  country  together  with  her
    other family members and family life continued as before.  Applications
    for leave to be extended were made by the  Appellant,  her  mother  and
    younger sister.  In  respect  of  the  Appellant  the  application  was
    refused, whereas in respect of the other two family  members  leave  to
    remain was granted, as we have stated already.   It  seems  unfortunate
    that the Appellant's own application was put on what seems to have been
    an erroneous basis given her mother's status  at  all  material  times.
    However, that is in our view no fault of the Appellant.

32. It is highly unlikely in our view that she would be able to  live  with
    the older sister who is herself married and has no doubt her own family
    unit to consider.  In theory it might be possible for the Appellant  to
    return to Turkey and live with the grandmother. That possibility in our
    view  does  not  undermine   the   existence   of   compelling   family
    circumstances.

33. In essence, these circumstances consist of  the  following  matters:  a
    strong pre-existing family unit that has pursued lawful means of  entry
    to the United Kingdom with a view to settle here, will be split by  the
    Appellant (and only the Appellant)  having  to  leave.  The  underlying
    basis for that  state  of  affairs  is  the  fact  that  her  extension
    application was made on an incorrect basis (namely for indefinite leave
    under paragraph 298 rather than for further limited leave).  Given that
    no other issues in relation to accommodation, maintenance and such like
    have ever been raised, it is in our view  highly  likely  that  if  the
    application in 2015 had been put on  a  correct  basis,  the  Appellant
    would have been granted further leave to remain in line with her mother
    and sister and she would not be in the position in which she now  finds
    herself.  Rather, the Appellant would have been in the same position as
    her mother and sister, namely close to the  end  of  the  path  towards
    settlement.

34. We have full regard to all the mandatory factors under section 117B  of
    the 2002 Act.  The public interest is clearly an important  factor  and
    we place significant weight  upon  it,  including  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant could  not  satisfy  paragraph  298  in  its  entirety.   The
    Appellant is, on the face of  it,  partially  financially  independent.
    She is working and earning money.  At  most  this  factor  would  count
    against her only to a limited extent.  As to her level of  English,  we
    note the letter from her employers (TFC).  It appears  from  this  that
    she has a role dealing  with  customers  and,  taking  everything  into
    account we are satisfied that her standard of English is sufficient  as
    to render the relevant  factor  of  neutral  effect.   The  Appellant's
    status is, and always has been  precarious,  and  to  that  extent  the
    weight placed upon both her family life must be reduced.   However,  we
    place that in the context of the history of that family life as set out
    previously.  We take into account the fact  that  the  Appellant  could
    potentially  return  to  Turkey  without   facing   particularly   dire
    consequences.

35. On the Appellant's side of the scales is the very  significant  context
    of  her  migration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  family   situation
    thereafter, as described previously.  As we have already stated,  those
    circumstances in this particular case, are  compelling.   Weighing  all
    relevant matters up we would conclude that the balance falls in  favour
    of the Appellant and thus the appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law.

We set aside that decision.

We remake the decision on the Appellant's appeal, allowing it on  the  basis
that the Respondent's decision breaches the  Appellant's  Article  8  rights
and is therefore unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  a
whole fee award of �140.00. The  Appellant  has  succeeded  in  her  appeal,
based upon factors that were known,  or  should  have  been  known,  to  the
Respondent prior to our decision on this appeal.
