                          Determination and Reasons

Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms Antonia Nwabiakam, the sponsor
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Background

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission to
      the Entry Clearance  Officer  (Nigerian  post  not  specified)  on  12
      September 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cheales in respect of  the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Callender Smith who allowed
      the appeal by way of a determination dated 19 August 2014  2014.   For
      convenience I continue to refer to the Entry Clearance Officer as  the
      respondent and to Mrs Nwabiakam as the appellant.

   2.       The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 14 April 1948. She
      sought entry clearance to join her daughter, the  sponsor,  under  the
      provisions of paragraph EC-DR 1.1(d) of Appendix FM.  Her  application
      was refused on 8 November 2013 because the ECO was not satisfied  that
      the appellant and sponsor were related as claimed, or  that  the  care
      the appellant required could not be provided in Nigeria with financial
      support from her sponsor.

   3.       The appeal came before Judge  Callender  Smith  who  heard  oral
      evidence from  the  sponsor,  considered  the  substantial  bundle  of
      documentary evidence provided and concluded that the  requirements  of
      the rules had been met.

   4.       The respondent sought and obtained permission to appeal  on  the
      grounds that it was arguable that  the  judge  had  taken  account  of
      evidence that post dated the decision. There is no  challenge  to  the
      judge's positive finding on the relationship.

   5.       The appellant's representative was unable to attend the  hearing
      due to illness but the sponsor  indicated  that  she  was  content  to
      proceed. Having explained the issue to her, I then invited  Ms  Holmes
      to make submissions. She did so and relied on the  grounds  with  some
      expansion and reference to sections of the determination. The  sponsor
      then responded.  She  summarised  her  mother's  condition  since  her
      accident in 2009 to the present time. Ms Holmes made a brief response.
      At the conclusion of the hearing I indicated that I would be upholding
      the judge's decision to allow the appeal and I now give my reasons for
      so doing.

Findings and Conclusions

   6.       The judge was satisfied on the basis of DNA  evidence  that  the
      appellant and sponsor were related as claimed. There is  no  challenge
      to that finding.

   7.       With  regard  to  the  respondent's  criticism  of  the  judge's
      decision, it is important  to  place  his  findings  in  context.  The
      appellant's health problems began in 2009 after a serious road traffic
      accident when she was badly  injured.  Prior  to  that  she  had  been
      reasonably well and indeed had made  visits  to  the  UK  to  see  the
      sponsor and her  family.  The  appellant  suffered  head  injuries,  a
      fractured  rib,  fractured  clavicle  and  fractured  femur  and   was
      hospitalised for over a month. She developed mental health issues  and
      suffered depression and memory loss. She  has  been  wheelchair  bound
      since the operation, cannot sit up on her own and requires  help  with
      getting out of bed, toileting, washing,  dressing,  cooking,  shopping
      and keeping hospital appointments. Due to  her  immobility  since  the
      accident she has become  morbidly  obese.  She  has  required  further
      surgery for bone grafting and to insert plates but due to the lack  of
      satisfactory post operative care, she has had  falls  and  the  plates
      have been displaced requiring yet more surgery. The sponsor  has  been
      to visit her in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Confirmation  of  her
      travel is provided by the copies of her passport  which  show  several
      visits each year. Details of the appellant's  health  issues  and  the
      steps the sponsor has taken since 2009 to attempt to address them  are
      set out  fully  in  the  substantial  documentary  evidence  that  was
      submitted to the First-tier Tribunal. There is ample medical  evidence
      to support the sponsor's account and documentary evidence of the costs
      that she has incurred since 2009. These facts  are  relevant  as  they
      clearly show that the appellant's problems are ongoing and whilst they
      may have  become  even  more  serious  as  the  judge  noted  and  was
      criticised for doing so, he was not so much making a decision on  post
      decision evidence as looking at it as an ongoing issue which had begun
      in 2009. To single out phrases he has used here and there is unhelpful
      and  disregards  the  context  in  which  they  were  made   and   the
      inevitability of a deteriorating condition the longer she is  deprived
      of the care she so badly requires and as she ages.  Whilst  the  judge
      does indeed refer to the situation after the date of decision, he does
      so only after having accepted the situation  as  it  was  between  the
      accident in 2009 and the date of the decision. The observations on how
      matters have developed since then complete the picture in the sense of
      these problems being an ongoing concern.  That  is  confirmed  by  his
      finding that the  appellant  "continues  to  be  very  seriously  ill"
      (paragraph 41). Rather than demonstrating an error  of  the  kind  the
      respondent suggests in her grounds, this confirms that the appellant's
      situation now is as it was previously. It is  therefore  a  fact  that
      appertains to the situation as at the date of the decision.

   8.       It would be wholly misconceived to argue that  the  judge  based
      his  decision  on  post  decision  evidence.  Much  of  that  evidence
      appertains to facts in existence prior to the date of the decision  in
      November 2013. Additionally it is plain from  his  determination  that
      the judge made several findings on the pre  November  2013  facts.  He
      notes  the  absence  of  care  homes  and  care  agencies  in  Nigeria
      (paragraph 15), the care arrangements the sponsor had made (paragraphs
      16-17), the inadequacy of the arrangements (18) and  the  difficulties
      in finding a carer (19-20). The criticism of the judge's reference  in
      paragraph  21  to  an  abscess  which  developed  in  March  2014   is
      unjustified as it is a summary of the sponsor's oral evidence and  not
      a finding on which the decision was based.

   9.       The judge found the sponsor's oral testimony and the documentary
      evidence provided to be cogent, credible and compelling (paragraph 31)
      and I am bound to say that I, too, was very impressed with the case as
      put by the sponsor on behalf of her mother. She is clearly  a  devoted
      daughter and has done everything possible to obtain for the mother the
      care that she so  badly  requires  since  her  very  unfortunate  road
      accident in 2009. The judge plainly made his decision after great care
      and a thorough examination of the evidence (paragraphs 33-34). He  was
      satisfied that there was no professional caring option in Nigeria  for
      the appellant (paragraphs 36-38 and  43).  He  found  that  since  the
      accident, the sponsor had spent over ï¿½100,000 on trying to  solve  the
      problem for her mother and  had  run  herself  ragged  physically  and
      financially (paragraph 39) and that her  children  had  also  suffered
      (paragraph 44). Contrary to what the respondent argues in the grounds,
      the sponsor cannot afford to pay for the care which in  any  event  is
      wholly inadequate. His finding that "the idea that she  (the  sponsor)
      would not find a way of having her mother's needs met in Nigeria -  if
      there was such a way for that to be achieved - flies in  the  face  of
      what I have listened to in the sponsor's  evidence  and  read  in  the
      appellant's appeal  file"  (paragraph  45)  is  one  that  was  wholly
      supported by the evidence.

  10.       Whilst it is right to say that the sponsor  has  been  providing
      the funds for her mother, the respondent does not take account of  the
      fact that those funds have partially  come  from  loans,  from  credit
      cards and from  friends  and  church  goers.  The  argument  that  the
      sponsor, a single mother, albeit employed  as  a  senior  nurse,  with
      three  dependent  children,  was  able  to  meet  the  costs  of   the
      appellant's health care is just not supported by the evidence. She has
      certainly done well to raise the money, to  go  without  so  that  the
      funds can be channelled to the appellant, but that certainly cannot be
      described as affordable health care. When the costs  involved  in  her
      regular visits and the loss of income whilst she is away  (as  she  is
      self employed) are factored into the equation, it may be seen that the
      care is not affordable.

  11.       The rules require the appellant to show, inter alia, that:
    . as a result of age, illness or  disability,  she  requires  long  term
      personal care to perform everyday tasks,
    . she must be unable, even with the practical and financial help of  the
      sponsor, be unable to obtain the required level of care in the country
      where she is living because
         o it is not available and
         o there is no person who can reasonably provide it or
         o it is not affordable.

  12.       It is  not  disputed  that  the  appellant  requires  long  term
      personal care. With regard to the second requirement,  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge was satisfied having considered all the evidence,  that
      there was no infrastructure in Nigeria for the  kind  of  professional
      carers required for the elderly in Nigeria, let  alone  the  aged  ill
      like the appellant (paragraph 40).  He  sets  out  extracts  from  the
      documents to support his finding. Ms Holmes did not seek to argue that
      adequate care would be available or that there was  someone  else  who
      would be able to provide it. The judge was therefore entitled to find,
      on the basis of evidence appertaining to the facts as at the  date  of
      the decision, that the required level of care was  not  available  and
      that there was no person who could provide it (at paragraph 46).  Once
      those requirements are met, the issue of affordability does  not  even
      arise and so the respondent's arguments in Ground 2 are irrelevant  in
      this appeal.

  13.       For all these reasons, I conclude that the judge  did  not  make
      any errors of law, that his determination is  carefully  prepared  and
      thorough and  that  all  his  findings  are  fully  supported  by  the
      evidence. There is no  misdirection  of  the  nature  alleged  by  the
      respondent. I uphold the determination. Given the seriousness  of  the
      appellant's condition, I would hope that  this  decision  is  speedily
      implemented.

Decision

  14.       The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not make errors of law and his
      decision to allow the appeal stands.

Anonymity

  15.       The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no order for anonymity and no
      request for one was made to me.
