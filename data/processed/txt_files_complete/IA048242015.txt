                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. Following a grant of permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  the
   First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  against   the
   respondent's decision of 16 January 2015 to refuse  his  application  for
   indefinite leave to remain on the basis of long residence, it was  found,
   at an error of law hearing on 2 March 2016, that the First-tier  Tribunal
   had made errors of law in its decision. The decision was accordingly  set
   aside and directions made for it to be re-made.



Immigration History


2. The appellant's immigration history  is  of  particular  significance  to
   this appeal and is as follows.


3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on  18  April  2005  with  entry
   clearance as a student valid until 30 June  2007.  On  21  June  2007  he
   applied for leave to remain as a student and he was granted  leave  on  8
   March 2008, following a successful appeal against an initial  refusal  of
   leave, until 3 July 2008. On 30 June 2008 he applied for further leave to
   remain as a student and leave was granted until 30 April 2009.


4. On 22 April 2009 the appellant lodged an application for leave to  remain
   as a Tier 4 general student. On 19 July 2009 the application was rejected
   as invalid. On 4 August 2009 the appellant lodged another application for
   leave to remain as a Tier 4 student; that application was refused  on  11
   September 2009 without a right  of  appeal.  On  30  September  2009  the
   appellant lodged another application for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
   student, as a result of which leave to remain was granted on 25  November
   2009 until 25 July 2010. Thereafter the appellant was granted  successive
   periods of leave as a Tier 4 student until 16 June 2012  and  then  as  a
   Tier 1 post study migrant until 23 August  2014,  with  each  application
   being submitted during the period of extant leave.


5. On 21 August 2014 the appellant applied for indefinite  leave  to  remain
   on the basis of ten years' continuous lawful residence.  His  application
   was refused on 16 January 2015 and a decision was also made to remove him
   from the UK under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality
   Act 2006.


Respondent's Decision

6. The respondent, in refusing the appellant's application, considered  that
   he had failed to show ten years of continuous lawful residence in the UK.
   The respondent considered that the continuous period of lawful  residence
   was broken between 19 July 2009, when the appellant's application at that
   time was rejected as invalid, and 25 November 2009 when  he  was  granted
   leave to remain. It was considered  that  the  application  made  by  the
   appellant on 30 September 2009, which was  successful,  had  nevertheless
   been submitted out of time and the period of time awaiting the outcome of
   that out of time application was not, therefore, considered to be  lawful
   leave. Accordingly the respondent did not accept that the  appellant  was
   able to meet the requirements of paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the  immigration
   rules and refused his application under paragraph  276D.  The  respondent
   went on to  consider  whether  the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of
   Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE on the basis of family and private  life,
   but concluded that he  did  not,  and  that  there  were  no  exceptional
   circumstances justifying a grant of leave outside the immigration rules.




Appeal before the First-tier Tribunal

7. The appellant appealed that decision  and  his  appeal  was  heard  on  6
   August 2015 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Real.  The  respondent  was  not
   represented at that hearing. The appellant was represented by his current
   representative, Mr Nasim.

8. The basis of the appellant's appeal was that the respondent was wrong  to
   say that he had not had ten years' continuous lawful residence in the UK,
   when he had. He disputed the period of 19 July 2009 to 25  November  2009
   during which the respondent claimed his lawful residence had been broken.
   He claimed that the application made on 22 April 2009  had  been  wrongly
   rejected by the respondent as invalid. The application had been  rejected
   on the basis that he had used the wrong application form, but he  claimed
   that he had used the correct form. He claimed, in the  alternative,  that
   there were transitional provisions under immigration  rule  34A  allowing
   for an older version of the form to be accepted for up to 21 days after a
   change of form, and that it appeared from the respondent's archives  that
   a new version of the form "03/09" was in use  from  31  March  2009.  His
   application had been made one day  outside  that  period  and  discretion
   ought therefore to have been  exercised  in  his  favour.  The  appellant
   submitted that his further application made on 4  August  2009  had  been
   refused on the basis that the bank statements were not  up  to  date  and
   that, in his subsequent application made on 30  September  2009,  he  had
   pointed out to the respondent that the rejection of the application of 22
   April 2009 was erroneous.

9. Judge Real considered that she did not have jurisdiction to consider  the
   lawfulness of the decision of 19 July 2009 which was  not  an  appealable
   decision and had not been challenged by way of  judicial  review  at  the
   time. She did not accept the submissions made on behalf of the  appellant
   that his circumstances were similar  to  those  in  Basnet  (validity  of
   application - respondent) Nepal [2012] UKUT 113. She therefore considered
   that she had to treat the decision of 19 July 2009 as a  lawful  one  and
   consequently the appellant could not establish ten  years  of  continuous
   lawful  residence.  Accordingly  she  dismissed  the  appeal  under   the
   immigration  rules,  and  having  considered  paragraph  245ADE  of   the
   immigration rules and Article 8 outside the rules, she also dismissed the
   appeal on human rights grounds.

10. Permission to appeal was sought by the appellant on various grounds  and
   was initially refused. However permission was subsequently granted in the
   Upper Tribunal on 10 January 2016,  on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal had arguably erred in its approach to the validity of  the  2009
   application.

Error of Law

11. At a hearing on 2 March  2016,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Coker  found  as
   follows:


      "I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law  in  failing
      to analyse and establish whether  the  rejection  of  the  April  2009
      application was unlawful. Such error of law is  material  because  the
      consequences  of  an  unlawful  rejection  are  matters  that  require
      analysis in terms of the consequent lawfulness or unlawfulness of  the
      appellant's residence in the UK and the proportionality of the Article
      8 decision - although it was accepted that if the appellant  met  276B
      in its totality then any decision under Article 8 was academic."


12.  I have appended Judge Coker's full decision to the end of my  decision,
   as "Appendix I".

13. Having found an error of law in Judge Real's  decision,  Upper  Tribunal
   Judge Coker then set aside the decision and adjourned the  appeal  for  a
   resumed hearing on a later date, with the following directions:


     "Consequential Directions


       1. Leave to both parties to file and serve such further  documentary
          evidence as they wish to rely upon, such documents  to  be  filed
          and served no later than 10 days before the resumed hearing.
       2. The parties to file and serve a skeleton argument no later than 3
          days before the resumed hearing with specific  reference  to  the
          following:
          i) What is the consequence of a finding that the application of 22
             April 2009 was incorrectly rejected and in particular does such
             a finding result in the  appellant  being  deemed  to  have  3C
             leave?
         ii) Does the refusal of the 4th August  2009  application  on  11th
             September 2009 have any impact on those consequences and if  so
             what?
       3. No oral evidence, submissions only.
       4. The respondent is encouraged to  undertake  such  checks  as  are
          necessary to establish whether there are  any  matters  that  she
          would wish to bring to the attention of the Tribunal with  regard
          to Paragraph 276B(ii)(iii)(iv) or (v).
       5. Liberty to apply."


Resumed Hearing

14. The appeal then came before me following a Transfer Order. I  sought  to
   clarify the issues with the parties. Mr Nasim, who was  the  only  person
   present at the hearing before Upper Tribunal Judge Coker, advised me that
   it had been accepted by the judge at the  hearing  that  the  appellant's
   application of 22 April 2009 was a valid one. Mr Melvin agreed that  that
   may have been the case, but nevertheless maintained his position that the
   wrong form had been used. He submitted that the appellant ought  to  have
   challenged the invalidity decision at the time it was  made  and  it  was
   relevant that the appellant had had his fee refunded.

15. Mr Nasim submitted that the invalidity decision was  challenged  at  the
   time, in the appellant's solicitor's letter  of  30  September  2009,  at
   pages 62 and  63  of  the  appeal  bundle,  which  enclosed  the  renewed
   application for leave to remain, and that the respondent's  response  was
   to grant the  appellant  further  leave  to  remain.  He  relied  on  the
   reference  in  that  letter  to  the  fees  not  having  been   refunded.
   Accordingly the respondent was wrong to treat the application of 22 April
   2009 as invalid. Since the application made on 22 April 2009  was  valid,
   the appellant's 3C leave continued  until  the  refusal  decision  on  11
   September 2009. The subsequent application was made within 28 days, on 30
   September 2009, and therefore the period of overstaying between 11 and 30
   September 2009 would be disregarded pursuant  to  paragraph  276B(v).  Mr
   Nasim advised me that Judge Coker had adjourned the appeal  in  order  to
   give the respondent an opportunity to address  any  issues  in  paragraph
   276B(ii) to (v).

Consideration and findings

16. Pages 144 to 161 of the appellant's bundle contain  the  FLR(S)  version
   11/2008 for applications for an extension of stay as a student made on or
   after 25 November 2008. That is clearly not the application form that was
   used by the appellant when he made his application on 22 April 2009.  The
   application form he completed and submitted on 22 April 2009  appears  at
   pages 12 to 59 of the appeal bundle and is identical to the  Tier  4  (G)
   version 03/09 application form appearing at pages 64 to  199,  save  that
   some of the pages of the appellant's form have version 11/08  written  at
   the bottom, as detailed at [11(c)] of Judge Coker's decision.

17. The respondent has been unable to offer any explanation as to how  there
   could have been a version 11/08 for a Tier 4 application form,  when  the
   Tier 4 scheme was introduced only on 31 March 2009 and why the form  used
   indicated on some pages that it was version 11/08 but yet on other  pages
   that it was version 03/09. Neither was there any explanation  as  to  how
   the correct version of the form could have been  the  06/09  version,  as
   written in manuscript on page 9 of the appellant's application form (page
   12 of the appeal bundle), when the application was made in April 2009.

18. The only conclusion that I am able to reach is that the  appellant  used
   the correct form and that any errors at the bottom  of  the  form  citing
   version 11/08 were errors made by the respondent on  their  website  from
   which the form was downloaded. There can be no doubt that the application
   form the appellant used was a Tier  4  (general)  application  form  and,
   since the Tier 4 scheme was introduced on 31 March 2009,  the  only  form
   that could have been used in April 2009 was version 03/09.


19. The respondent submits that it is too late now to  treat  the  22  April
   2009  application  as  being  valid,  as  the  appellant  ought  to  have
   challenged the validity decision previously, and relies on  the  decision
   in Mitchell (Basnet revisited) [2015] UKUT 562 in that  regard.  However,
   the circumstances in the appellant's  case  are  different  to  those  in
   Mitchell as it does not concern fee payments and evidence which  had  not
   been retained by the respondent. Further,  and  more  significantly,  the
   appellant clearly did challenge the validity decision in his  application
   of 30 September 2009, and whilst there was no direct or specific response
   to the challenge itself, further leave was granted and, as stated  in  Mr
   Nasim's skeleton argument at [10], on the basis of the  appellant  having
   an established presence in the UK. Accordingly, it seems to me  that  the
   appellant's application of 22 April 2009 was wrongly rejected as  invalid
   and was a valid application and that it should be treated as such for the
   purposes of his long residence application.


20. The result of this is that the appellant's period  of  leave  to  remain
   which was valid until 30 April 2009 was extended, by virtue  of  the  in-
   time valid application made on 22 April 2009, under  section  3C  of  the
   Immigration Act 1971. When he made the subsequent application on 4 August
   2009, which was accepted by the respondent as a valid application, albeit
   an unsuccessful application, that in fact fell  to  be  considered  as  a
   variation of his previous application, so that  his  3C  leave  continued
   until the application was refused on 11 September 2009.  The  application
   of 30 September 2009, having been made within 28 days of  the  expiry  of
   the appellant's 3C leave, then extended his leave,  with  the  period  of
   overstaying between 11 and 30 September 2009  being  discounted  for  the
   purposes  of  establishing  continuous  lawful  residence   pursuant   to
   paragraph 276B(v).


21. Accordingly, the appellant had, by 18 April 2015,  completed  ten  years
   of continuous lawful residence. Whilst  those  ten  years  had  not  been
   completed at the time  he  made  his  application  or  by  the  time  the
   respondent made the decision of 16 January 2015, it was completed by  the
   time of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, his leave having  been
   extended until that time, and continues to be extended, under section  3C
   of the Immigration Act 1971. The appellant is, therefore,  able  to  meet
   the requirements of paragraph 276B(i).


22. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to the extent  that  the  appellant's
   application for indefinite leave to remain remains to be  considered  and
   determined by the respondent on the basis that the  appellant  meets  the
   requirements of paragraph 276B(i)(a). In light of  the  fourth  direction
   made by Upper Tribunal Coker in relation to paragraph 276B(ii) to (v) and
   the lack of response by the respondent, it is envisaged  that  indefinite
   leave to remain will now be granted. However that is  a  matter  for  the
   Secretary of State.


DECISION

23. The original Tribunal was found to have made an error of law. I  re-make
   the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal to the extent  stated  at
   [22] above.

                         ERROR OR LAW AND DIRECTIONS

        Appellant's immigration history


     1. The appellant arrived in the UK on 18th April 2005  as  a  student.
        His leave to remain was  periodically  extended  until  30th  April
        2009.


     2. On 22nd April 2009 he submitted an application for leave to  remain
        as a Tier 4  student.  On  19th  July  2009  that  application  was
        rejected. On 4th August 2009 he made an application  for  leave  to
        remain as a Tier 4 student; that application was  refused  on  11th
        September 2009 with no right of appeal. On 30th September  2009  he
        lodged an application for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  general
        student and on 25th November he was granted leave to  remain  until
        25th June 2010.


     3. On 24th June 2010 he lodged an application  for  further  leave  to
        remain as a Tier 4 student and was granted  leave  until  18th  May
        2011. On 20th April 2011 he applied for further leave to remain  as
        a Tier 4 student and on 21st April 2011 he  was  granted  leave  to
        remain until 16th June 2012.

     4. On 29th March 2012 he submitted an application for leave to  remain
        as a Tier 1 post study migrant and  on  23rd  August  2012  he  was
        granted leave to remain until 23rd August 2014.

     5. On 21st August 2014 the appellant applied for indefinite  leave  to
        remain on  the  grounds  of  10  years  lawful  residence[1].  That
        application was refused by the respondent in a decision dated  16th
        January 2015 and a removal  decision  made  under  s47  Immigration
        Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006  for  reasons  set  out  in  the
        accompanying letter of the same date. The respondent contended that
        the appellant had been present in the UK without  leave  to  remain
        between 19th July 2009 (when his application for Tier 4  leave  was
        rejected) and 25th November 2009 (when he  was  granted  a  further
        period  of  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK).   This   amounted   to
        approximately four months  and  during  that  period  of  time  the
        applicant was present without lawful leave to remain.

     6.  The  appellant  appealed  the  decision.  He  submitted  that  his
        application for further leave to remain made on 22nd April 2009 had
        been unlawfully rejected - he had used the correct application form
        as set out on the respondent's website. He  argued  that  had  that
        application form not been unlawfully rejected, his leave to  remain
        would have continued as 3C leave until the further grant  of  leave
        to remain granted on 25th November 2009. His appeal  was  dismissed
        by First-tier Tribunal Judge Real under the Immigration  Rules  and
        on Article 8 grounds in a decision promulgated on 17th August 2015.
        The  judge  found  that  the  rejection  of  the  22nd  April  2009
        application was not unlawful on its face  and  that  it  should  be
        treated as lawful  unless  and  until  overturned  by  a  court  of
        competent jurisdiction. Judge Real found that it would be an  error
        of law for her to consider the lawfulness of the decision  of  19th
        July 2009 within the appeal against the decision the subject of the
        appeal.

     7. The appellant sought and was granted permission to  appeal  on  the
        grounds that it was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal judge had
        erred in failing to establish as  a  matter  of  fact  whether  the
        appellant had continuous lawful residence since his arrival in  the
        UK and that an integral part of that assessment was the  lawfulness
        of the rejection of the April 2009 application; the  appellant  was
        not, as found by the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  in  [28]  of  the
        decision, appealing against the July 2009 decision. It was asserted
        that the judge had erred in finding that she could not consider the
        'lawfulness' of the July 2009 decision [31]. Although other grounds
        were set out in the application for permission in reality they  are
        substantially subsumed within this ground.

     8. The appellant was also granted permission to appeal the decision on
        Article 8 grounds. Although reliance on this was not  withdrawn  it
        was not pursued with any vigour - the main argument being that,  if
        the appellant had been unlawfully present in the UK it  was  for  a
        very short period and the judge had failed to have adequate  regard
        to this, placing undue weight upon his unlawful presence.

     9. Although the decision to reject the April 2009 application had  not
        been judicially reviewed, Mr Nasim  submitted  that  this  did  not
        impact upon the requirement for the First-tier Tribunal to consider
        the lawfulness of the decision. The  issue  before  the  First-tier
        Tribunal was the lawfulness of the appellant's residence in the  UK
        and that could not be considered without  considering  the  factual
        accuracy of the rejection of the April 2009 application.

    10. Mr Kandola, relying upon Mitchell (Basnet  revisited)  [2015]  UKUT
        00562 (IAC) submitted that where there was an  allegation  that  an
        application had been unlawfully rejected   that  matter  should  be
        taken up immediately; if the matter  was  not  pursued  vigorously,
        nothing had been done after 30th September 2009, there had been  no
        express acknowledgement by the respondent that the rejection was in
        error and the appellant had not pursued the matter, it was not open
        to the appellant seven years later to put the respondent to proof.

    11. Mr Nasim referred me to a number of documents in the bundle  before
        the First-tier Tribunal:

        a)  Extract  from  the  respondent's  archive  snapshot  taken   on
           21/01/2009 headed "Students applying before  the  end  of  March
           2009" which reads, inter alia,


             Applications made on or after the 25  November  2008  must  be
           made on version 11/2008.
             If you are a student who  already  has  leave  (permission  to
           stay) to study here, you can apply to extend your stay if:
             *    you will not  spend  more  than  a  total  of  two  years
           studying short courses....
             *    You should ensure that you meet.....
           To apply for an extension of stay in the United Kingdom to study
           you will need to apply using the FLR(S)  application  form.  You
           can download this form.....

        b) Extract from respondent's archive taken on 14/04/2009


             "Student appointments made at  public  enquiry  office  on  or
             after 31st March


             04 March 2009


             On 31 March 2009, the UK Border Agency will introduce  Tier  4

             accurate mobile telephone number).


             UPDATE - 09 March 2009


             We have now replaced the draft Tier 4 guidance with  the  full
             version: ....

        c) Tier 4 (General) Application form dated  22/04/09  submitted  by
           the appellant consisting of 55 pages of which  the  footnote  of
           all the pages save 26, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55  reads
           Tier 4 (G) Application Form (Version 11/08) page  XX;  on  these
           pages the footnote reads Tier 4 (G)  Application  Form  (Version
           03/09) page XX. The original of this form was provided  both  to
           the First-tier Tribunal and to me; the respondent  accepted  the
           copy in the bundle was a copy of the original. Endorsed  on  the
           bottom of page 9 in handwriting (it was accepted by a caseworker
           of the respondent) was "(06/09) Version". At the top right  hand
           corner is a date stamp of "23 APR 2009" and just to the left  of
           that is handwritten written "invalid ICC4 19-07-09".


        d) Copy letter from the respondent's solicitors dated 30  September
           2009 stating, inter alia,

                  Our client is a Bangladeshi national and  applied  for  an
                  extension of his leave to remain in the UK on  22nd  April
                  2009. His leave was due to expire on 30th April.  However,
                  his application was erroneously rejected as being  invalid
                  and returned on 19th July 2009. The sole reason given  for
                  rejection of the application as being invalid was that our
                  client had used the incorrect version of  the  application
                  form. Our client had used  version  11/08.  That  was  the
                  correct version in force at the date that our client  made
                  the application on 22nd April 2009. Following rejection of
                  that application on 19th July our client then submitted  a
                  further application for lease(sic) to remain in the UK  on
                  4th August. That application was  refused  on  substantive
                  grounds namely that our client had  not  provided  a  bank
                  statement which was less than a month  old.  We  have  now
                  enclosed a new application  form  together  with  all  the
                  documents that  were  sent  in  support  of  the  previous
                  application.
                  ......
                  ....Our client has combined savings of �2,102.93. This  is
                  clearly in excess of the relevant threshold. Therefore  we
                  trust you will be satisfied  that  our  client  meets  all
                  relevant requirements and we  look  forward  to  receiving
                  confirmation of grant of his application for extension  of
                  leave.


                  For the reasons given above out client's  application  was
                  incorrectly  rejected  as  being  invalid  in  the   first
                  instance. But for rejection of that application our client
                  would have been lawfully resident in the UK and given your
                  error in this regard our client ought to be placed in  the
                  same position as if that error had not been made. He ought
                  therefore to be treated as being lawfully resident in  the
                  UK.....



    12. Mr Nasim submitted that the fee to be paid by an  existing  student
        resident in the UK for an extension of leave to remain for a course
        studied in London at the relevant time was �800 for  each  calendar
        month of the course up to a maximum of two months  ie  �1600.  This
        was the sum set out in box K10 of the initial application form.  He
        submitted that the application  was  not  rejected  on  any  ground
        despite the respondent having rejected an earlier application  thus
        on the face of it rendering the applicant  an  overstayer  of  more
        than 28 days.  The application was granted.


    13. Mr Nasim submitted that according to archive searches done  by  the
        instructing solicitor there is no form marked 11/08 and the form in
        use on the date the applicant submitted his form is 03/09. There is
        no allegation that the applicant submitted a fraudulent  form.  The
        instructing solicitors have compared  Form  03/09  taken  from  the
        archive with the form completed  by  the  appellant  and  the  only
        differences are the footnotes on most of the pages as  referred  to
        above ie showing 11/08 instead of 03/09.


    14. Mr Nasim also expressed  a  difficulty  in  understanding  how  the
        applicant could, in April 2009, have completed a form that was  not
        issued until 06/09 and yet it appears that the respondent  rejected
        the form because the form issued in 06/09 had not been completed.

    15. He disputed that  Mitchell  applied:  firstly,  the  appellant  had
        raised the incorrect rejection within a couple of months  of  being
        so informed; secondly the application was, on its  face,  correctly
        completed; thirdly the applicant was on the same  (albeit  updated)
        material granted an extension of leave to remain and  fourthly  the
        respondent did not dispute which  form  and  what  information  the
        appellant had submitted and she was not in any  way  disadvantaged.
        Mr Nasim submitted that this was a very different situation than in
        Mitchell where the matter was not raised by the appellant for  many
        years, the form was not complete on its face and the respondent was
        put to proof of matters on documents which  they  had  legitimately
        destroyed because of the time that had passed.  He  submitted  that
        there had been no need for this  appellant  to  pursue  the  matter
        further at that time because he had been granted the leave  he  had
        sought in  accordance  with  provisions  that  treated  him  as  an
        appellant applying within an existing period of leave  and  he  had
        brought the incorrect rejection of his earlier application  to  the
        attention of the respondent when he made his application.


    16. Although the appellant  had  not  sought  judicial  review  of  the
        rejection of the April 2009 application in July 2009, he  had  made
        another application  which  not  only  asserted  that  the  earlier
        rejection was incorrect but also led  to  the  grant  of  leave  to
        remain to the applicant. Although not formally expressed as such it
        is plain that the respondent considered  that  application  and  in
        considering that application she  would  have  been  aware  of  the
        appellant's  immigration  history  -   particularly   because   the
        rejection was  specifically  brought  to  her  attention.  Had  the
        appellant successfully judicially reviewed that rejection, the most
        he could have expected would have been a quashing of that rejection
        and reconsideration with the subsequent grant of leave - the latter
        of which he obtained. I do not agree with the  First-tier  Tribunal
        that consideration of the 2009 rejection is, in effect,  an  appeal
        against that rejection.  Consideration is no more and no less  than
        an assessment of the lawfulness  of  the  rejection.  This  is  not
        usurping the  judicial  review  process  but  an  analysis  of  the
        lawfulness of the period of time that the applicant has been in the
        UK - a process which has to be undertaken  in  order  to  establish
        whether the appellant meets 276B(i)(a).


    17. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in failing
        to analyse and establish whether the rejection of  the  April  2009
        application was unlawful. Such error of law is material because the
        consequences of an unlawful  rejection  are  matters  that  require
        analysis in terms of the consequent lawfulness or  unlawfulness  of
        the appellant's residence in the UK and the proportionality of  the
        Article 8 decision - although it was accepted that if the appellant
        met 276B in its totality then any  decision  under  Article  8  was
        academic.


    18. In these circumstances I set aside the decision  to  be  remade.  I
        adjourn the remaking of the decision to a date to be fixed.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision to be remade.

         Consequential Directions


       6. Leave to both parties to file and serve such further  documentary
          evidence as they wish to rely upon, such documents  to  be  filed
          and served no later than 10 days before the resumed hearing.
       7. The parties to file and serve a skeleton argument no later than 3
          days before the resumed hearing with specific  reference  to  the
          following:
        iii) What is the consequence of a finding that the application of 22
             April 2009 was incorrectly rejected and in particular does such
             a finding result in the  appellant  being  deemed  to  have  3C
             leave?
         iv) Does the refusal of the 4th August  2009  application  on  11th
             September 2009 have any impact on those consequences and if  so
             what?
       8. No oral evidence, submissions only.
       9. The respondent is encouraged to  undertake  such  checks  as  are
          necessary to establish whether there are  any  matters  that  she
          would wish to bring to the attention of the Tribunal with  regard
          to Paragraph 276B(ii)(iii)(iv) or (v).
      10. Liberty to apply.

    (i) (a) he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in the
    United Kingdom.
    (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons why it
    would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave to remain on
    the ground of long residence, taking into account his:
       (a) age; and
       (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and
       (c) personal history, including character, conduct, associations and
       employment record; and
       (d) domestic circumstances; and
       (e) compassionate circumstances; and

    (v) the applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration laws
    except that any period of overstaying for a period of 28 days or less
    will be disregarded, as will any period of overstaying between periods
    of entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain of up to 28 days
    and any period of overstaying pending the determination of an
    application made within that 28 day period.
