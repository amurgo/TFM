                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr G Dewar, Advocate, instructed by Bespoke
Solicitors, Harrow
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's  claim  on  protection  and  all
    other grounds for reasons set out in her decision dated 29 August 2016.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Pears dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 6 February 2017.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal, insisting on his  claim,  on
    rather vague and generalised grounds.

 4. FtT Judge J Grant-Hutchison refused permission on 19 May 2017,  on  the
    view that the grounds disclosed no arguable error of law.

 5. The application was renewed to the UT on the same grounds.   On 10 July
    2017 UT Judge Chalkley granted permission "on the basis that it appears
    from the record of proceedings that the judge was addressed on  article
    8 ... but has not dealt with it ... although the appellant  appears  to
    have been in the UK for some 12 years.  There  is  simply  no  arguable
    error of law identified elsewhere in the application".

 6. Mr Dewar (who had been instructed at quite short notice, and is not the
    author of the grounds) submitted thus:

   i. Failure to engage with submissions on article 8 was a material  error.
      The decision at �3 recorded that the case  was  advanced  in  part  on
      private life, but the "observations, findings of credibility and  fact
      and conclusions" at �88 - 105 made no mention of it.  The case  should
      therefore be remitted to the FtT.

  ii. It was anticipated that the presenting officer's position was that  if
      error was found, the UT should proceed today to make a fresh decision.
       The appellant had advised Mr Dewar this morning that he had with  him
      a large amount of further written evidence.  That  had  not  yet  been
      considered or prepared for presentation by his advisers.  It would  be
      undesirable to proceed immediately to a fresh  decision.   There  were
      likely to be motions for admission of further  evidence.   Whether  in
      the FtT or in the UT, that should preferably take place at  a  further
      hearing.

 iii. I noted that the decision says at �109  that  the  appellant  had  not
      shown very significant obstacles to his integration into Pakistan  and
      did not meet the requirements of �276ADE of the rules  in  respect  of
      his private life.  Mr Dewar said that did not go far enough  and  that
      there was no resolution of article 8, private life, outside the rules,
      an obvious omission, given the 12 years the appellant has spent in the
      UK, as observed in the grant.

  iv. The decision at �3 - 4 was not explicit as to  whether  private  life,
      outside the rules, had been relied upon.   If  necessary,  instructing
      agents could be asked to clarify.

 7. Mr Matthews submitted thus:

   i. The grounds of appeal to the  UT  made  no  complaint  of  failure  to
      consider any particular submission on article 8.  They included only a
      vague reliance on "a strong relationship with family, friends and  the
      local community ... family, social and cultural ties in the UK".

  ii. Notwithstanding the terms of his appeal grounds, the appellant had not
      claimed to have any immediate or even extended family members  in  the
      UK.

 iii. In terms of identifying error of law in the decision, the grounds were
      meaningless.

  iv. The appellant's counsel in the FtT had provided a  skeleton  argument,
      which made no mention of private life as a head of claim.

   v. The claim made in the FtT, as recorded in outline at �3  -  4  of  the
      decision, in terms of private life was  that  the  same  factors  were
      relied upon as for the protection claim.  They were inextricable.   It
      followed from that claim being  decided  against  the  appellant  that
      there were no obstacles to integration, so it  automatically  fell  at
      the same time.

  vi. The decision at �110 is not well worded, but it  concludes  that  "...
      relevant factors have already been assessed and a repeat evaluation is
      unnecessary ... there can be no grant of  leave  based  on  article  8
      outside the rules".  That was all that was needed.

 vii. If error was found, the tribunal should apply the  directions  it  had
      issued with the grant of permission. There was a presumption that  re-
      making of the  decision  would  proceed  at  the  same  hearing.   The
      appellant had been reminded of the requirements of any application for
      admission of fresh evidence, and had not complied.

viii. If remade on such evidence as was before the FtT, the case on  private
      life outside the rules was bound to fail.

 8. In course of submissions, I checked the file  and  advised  parties  as
    follows.  The usual pre-printed form headed "record of proceedings" was
    within the tagged part of the file, but the handwritten record on  that
    form said simply, "appellant gave evidence ....  submissions,  decision
    reserved ... ". Presumably a fuller note had been kept (as is required)
    and might have been seen by the permission judge, but I was  unable  to
    locate it.

 9. Mr Dewar in reply to the presenting officer's submissions said that the
    grant of permission suggested that the record showed there had  been  a
    submission, even if not in the skeleton argument  or  recorded  in  the
    decision, based on the appellant's 12 years in the UK and on article  8
    outside the rules, and that �109 - 110 of the decision did not  resolve
    it.

10. I reserved my decision.

11. Mr Dewar's submission made the best of  the  unpromising  materials  on
    which he had to base it. However, I am not persuaded that the making of
    the decision by Judge Pears involved the making of an error on a  point
    of law, and certainly not on any issue which might justify the decision
    being set aside.

12. Even if there had been some nominal reliance on article 8  and  private
    life outside the rules, which was far from  clear,  the  appellant  had
    advanced nothing in the FtT which had the remotest prospect of success.

13. Given failure to meet the private life rules and the precarious  nature
    of the appellant's immigration status, and applying part 5A of the 2002
    Act to the facts, the appellant's private life had to be  given  little
    weight.  There was nothing before the FtT by which it might  rationally
    have allowed the appeal on that basis.

14. If an error had been found, there would have been  much  force  in  the
    respondent's submission that a fresh decision  should  be  substituted,
    based on the evidence before the  FtT.  However,  that  matter  becomes
    academic.

15. I had reached the above decision in course  of  drafting,  prior  to  a
    final check of the contents of the file.

16. Separately from the  form  headed  "record  of  proceedings"  mentioned
    above, mixed among the parties' bundles and other papers loosely  kept,
    there is the handwritten record. It is on pages not attached  together,
    but it was capable of being reassembled in  order.   There  is  a  page
    headed "A", apparently of preparatory notes, pages numbered 1 - 19, and
    3 further pages, not numbered but obviously following on.

17. The record confirms that the case focused on protection issues.

18. The record of the submissions for the  appellant  begins  at  p.19  and
    opens:

      "Asylum ... + article 2 & 3

      No separate article 3 or 8 re illness

      Article 276 ADE (i) (vi)

      Article 8 family life no

      Outside rules - no".

19. The reference to "article 276ADE" is obviously a slip and  should  read
    "paragraph 276 ADE" [of the immigration rules].

20. Counsel in the FtT  had  correctly  perceived  and  conceded  that  any
    article 8 private life argument outside the rules was hopeless.

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

22. The FtT made an anonymity direction, although it is not said  that  one
    was sought, and  the  reason  was  not  stated.   The  matter  was  not
    addressed in the  UT.   In  those  circumstances,  anonymity  has  been
    preserved in this decision.
