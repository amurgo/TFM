                                                                   Appellant

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

    1. In a decision of 23 August 2013  granting  permission  to  appeal  I
       stated that unless the respondent was able to persuade me  otherwise
       within the next 14 days I would proceed to find that the First  tier
       Tribunal judge materially erred in law and that his decision was  to
       be set aside and the case remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


    2. The respondent made no response.

    3.  Accordingly  (and  pursuant  to  the  Senior   President   Practice
       Statement) I find that the First-tier Tribunal judge's  decision  is
       to be set aside for error of law (consisting of a flawed  assessment
       of credibility) and that the case is to be remitted  to  the  First-
       tier Tribunal to be heard de novo.



                               Signed
                                   Date




                                Judge of the Upper Tribunal
