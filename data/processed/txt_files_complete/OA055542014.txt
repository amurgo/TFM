                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with permission granted by  Deputy  Upper
           Tribunal Judge Saini on 6 May 2015 against the determination  of
           First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chamberlain  who  had  dismissed  the
           Appellant's appeal against the refusal on 21 January 2014 of his
           entry clearance application made under  paragraph  319H  of  the
           Immigration Rules as a dependant relative and  on  human  rights
           grounds (Article 8 ECHR family life) in a decision  and  reasons
           promulgated on 25 November 2014.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of China, born on 20 February  2004.
           The Appellant was in the United Kingdom  without  leave  at  the
           time of the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,  a  situation  which
           continues.   The judge found as  a  fact  that  the  Appellant's
           mother, in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
           Migrant, did not have sole responsibility for the Appellant  and
           that there were  no  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
           circumstances which  made  his  exclusion  undesirable.   As  to
           Article 8 ECHR, the judge found that the  Appellant's  exclusion
           was proportionate.


      3.    Permission to  appeal,  refused  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Grimmett, was granted  by  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Saini
           because he was considered that it was arguable  that  the  judge
           had failed to consider adequately the issues  of  the  allegedly
           absentee father, sole responsibility and  proportionality  under
           Article 8 ECHR.


      4.    Standard directions were made by the tribunal,  indicating  that
           the appeal would be re-decided immediately if a  material  error
           of law were found.  A rule 24  notice  had  been  filed  on  the
           Respondent's behalf, opposing the onwards appeal.




      Submissions


      5.    Mr Lewis for the Appellant relied on his skeleton argument,  the
           grounds of onwards appeal and  the  Upper  Tribunal's  grant  of
           permission to appeal.  In summary he contended  that  the  judge
           had failed to take into account the fundamental  nature  of  the
           Appellant's mother's  position  in  the  United  Kingdom,  as  a
           substantial investor and employer of five  people.   The  mother
           could  not  remain  here  without  her  son.   This  aspect   of
           immigration control and its relation to the public interest  had
           been considered by the Court of Appeal in  UE  (Nigeria)  [2010]
           EWCA Civ 975.  The public interest was not a fixed entity.  This
           could also be seen as a serious and compelling factor which  the
           judge had not addressed.


      6.    Counsel further submitted that the judge's findings in  relation
           to the rï¿½le of the  Appellant's  father  were  inadequate.   The
           judge had not taken into account the  objective  evidence  about
           employment conditions of the police in  China  and  had  ignored
           evidence about the problems which the father faced as the result
           of   his   employment.    TD   (Paragraph    297(i)(e):    "sole
           responsibility") Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049 had not been correctly
           interpreted, given that this  was   in  effect  a  family  split
           situation.   The determination  should  be  set  aside  and  the
           decision remade in the Appellant's favour.


      7.    Mr Avery for the Respondent relied on the rule 24  notice.   The
           judge had taken a proper approach, as could  be  seen  from  the
           Entry Clearance Manager's Review which had been  the  First-tier
           Tribunal's starting point.  The Appellant's mother  was  seeking
           to attack the judge's findings of fact which had  been  open  to
           her on the  evidence.   There  was  no  error  of  fact.     The
           Appellant's mother simply disagreed with the decision.   It  was
           relevant that she had acted without regard to the law  and  that
           had correctly informed the judge's credibility assessment of her
           evidence. There was no error of law.  The  determination  should
           stand.


      8.    In reply, Mr Lewis contended that all relevant factors  had  not
           been taken into account.


      9.    The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that  it
           reserved its determination, which now follows.




      No material error of law finding


      10.   In the tribunal's view the grant of permission to appeal in  the
           Upper Tribunal was best described as generous.  The  grounds  of
           onwards appeal were little more than an  attempt,  as  so  often
           seen in the Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber,  to  dress  up  a
           difference of  opinion  or  a  disagreement  with  a  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge's proper findings as an error of law.


      11.   Mr Lewis's assertion that the First-tier Tribunal  determination
           failed to take into account all relevant factors was extravagant
           and unjustified.  He identified no misapprehension of  any  fact
           by the judge, nor any error in the case  law  accurately  cited.
           The Appellant's  mother's  business  activities  in  the  United
           Kingdom were all a matter of choice on her part and  created  no
           obligation on the state to meet her personal wishes with  regard
           to her family.  UE (Nigeria) (above) is of no relevance  to  the
           requirements set out in paragraph 319H  and  was  in  any  event
           decided before the changes to the Immigration  Rules  introduced
           on 9 July 2012, which substantially changed the scope of Article
           8 ECHR: see, e.g., Gulshan (Article 8  -  new  rules  -  correct
           approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC), MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ
           1192 and SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387. The judge's conclusions
           about the relevance of the mother's business set out at [18] and
           [19] were fully open to her.   The  judge  was  similarly  fully
           entitled to reach her conclusions as to sole responsibility  and
           the  absence  of  serious  and  compelling   family   or   other
           circumstances: see [11] to [17] of the determination.  Given the
           Appellant's mother's unlawful behaviour,  it  was  open  to  the
           judge to treat her evidence with reserve.  There was no reliable
           evidence that the Appellant's father could not care for him with
           assistance of appropriate child  care,  no  different  it  might
           reasonably be thought from  the  situation  of  the  Appellants'
           working mother,  who  has  to  travel  in  connection  with  her
           business.


      12.   The judge gave full, careful and separate consideration  to  the
           Article 8  ECHR  family  life  issues  which  had  been  raised,
           including the best interests of the Appellant.  The judge  again
           considered the "public interest" questions argued to be relevant
           on the Appellant's mother's behalf and the  judge's  conclusions
           as set out at [38] of the determination are  unimpeachable.   If
           the Appellant's mother wishes to  make  representations  to  the
           Secretary of State outside the Immigration Rules  based  on  the
           value to the United Kingdom of her business activities that is a
           matter for her, but it is  not  a  compelling  or  compassionate
           circumstance which required the consideration of the exercise of
           discretion outside the Immigration Rules.


      13.   The tribunal finds that there was no error of law  in  the  full
           and careful determination and  there  is  no  proper  basis  for
           interfering with the experienced judge's decision.




      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision did not involve the making  of  an
error on a point of law and stands unchanged
