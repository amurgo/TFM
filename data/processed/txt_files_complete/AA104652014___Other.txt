Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms M Benitez, Counsel
For the respondent:    Ms M Tanner,, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. However for the sake of convenience  I  shall  continue  to
    refer to the Secretary of State as the respondent and  the  Mr  Morteza
    and his family as the appellants which are the designations  that  they
    had in the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal.   I  shall  also
    consider the appeal of the first appellant who I shall referred  to  as
    "the appellant"  because  of  the  appeals  of  the  second  and  third
    appellant, who are his wife and son, rests or falls with the appeal  of
    the first appellant.

 2. The appellant is a national of Iran born  on  21  September  1975.   He
    appeals to the Upper Tribunal against the decision  of  the  respondent
    dated 17 November 2014 to refuse to grant him asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection in the United Kingdom. In a determination dated 9  Februarys
    2015, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  V.A.  Lowe  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal on asylum grounds.  Permission to appeal was granted by Judge JM
    Holmes of the First-tier Tribunal on 2 March 2015.

 3. The Judge in his determination made  the  following  findings  which  I
    summarise. The appellant had a blog on the Internet in which  the  last
    entry is on 19 May 2014. The blog accuses the Revolutionary  Guards  at
    the Iranians Embassy of being involved in drug  dealing,  a  matter  of
    obvious interest to the Iranian Security forces. The previous entry  of
    15  May  2014  refers  to  Amnesty  International  and  criticises  the
    conditions at Evin prisons. On 10 April 2014 the  blog  quotes  the  US
    Foreign  Secretary  as  calling  the  Revolutionary  guards   and   the
    intelligence services terrorists. The site was  definitely  blocked  by
    the  Iranians  cyber  police  as  set  out  at  paragraph  26  of   the
    respondent's reason for refusal letter. The  respondent  suggests  that
    whilst the blog site had existed, the pages were a  concoction  with  a
    rogue log address.  The  respondent  also  contends  that  it  was  not
    possible from the documents to verify the identity of  the  creator  of
    the blog, or whether it was the appellant.  In  fact  as  indicated  at
    paragraph 15 of the determination, every post bears his  name  and  the
    margin of the pages dated 20 February and 19 May 2014 and 8 August 2013
    have the Farsi page with the appellant and his son's  photo  ending  in
    "view my complete profile". This evidence was produced at the hearing.

 4. I accept that the blog existed and has  been  blocked  by  the  Iranian
    cyber police, unless the first appellant  has  created  a  very  clever
    forgery of a website which is beyond my technical ability  to  discern,
    it is clear that the  appellant  had  no  problems  with  the  Iranians
    authorities whilst he was in Iran, which he confirmed at  question  101
    of his asylum interview. The appellant started in his blog on  27  July
    2013. After President Rohani was elected, he posted on his  blog  on  8
    August 2013 and attached a photograph of himself and  his  son  as  his
    profile. The appellant  explained  at  his  asylum  interview  that  he
    deliberately posted his photograph and that  of  his  son,  because  he
    wanted people to know who he was. He took no security precautions which
    is somewhat at odds  with  his  answer  that  the  authorities  checked
    websites randomly. Many bloggers would presumably  use  pseudonyms  not
    their own name and photograph and it is surprising that  the  appellant
    chose to do so openly particularly as he already knew of the  sad  fate
    of Sattr, the blogger who died in prison in 2012 in Iran. The appellant
    explained the reason that he posted his name on the blog  was  that  he
    was relying on the promise of president Rohani to be open to criticism.
    That may suggest a high level of naivetï¿½ but nevertheless, he  did  not
    attract the attention of the authorities whilst in Iran. Indeed he  had
    travelled in Europe in what appears to  have  been  in  2013,  went  to
    Istanbul to apply for his Tier-4 application in November 2013  and  was
    able to leave Iran with no problems. His blog must therefore have  been
    seen as relatively anodyne during 2013, and not falling  within  the  5
    million sites which are blocked by the Iranian cyber police.

 5. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on  15  February  2014  and
    only three of the translated extracts from the website predate 8 August
    2013. He wrote  blogs  about  former  political  prisoners  writing  to
    President Obama that sanctions hurt the Iranian people not the  regime.
    On 11 December 2013 he posted a  blog  about  the  son  of  a  moderate
    reformist politician publishing sex crimes by the Iranians  authorities
    and 8 January 2014 he wrote about Amnesty International's concern about
    Kurdish prisoners on hunger strike. Some of the blogs  are  accompanied
    by photographs and although the copies are very poor they do not appear
    to be as contentious as the stream of photos and  cartoons,  which  the
    blog features after the appellant arrived in the  United  Kingdom.  For
    example, on 20 February 2014 he posted  a  photograph  and  a  critical
    article on a man condemned to death  for  blasphemy  and  intentionally
    "insulting the Profit" in a private film.  On  25  February  2014,  the
    appellant posted a close-up photo  of  a  man's  face  after  a  severe
    beating by members of the Iranians intelligence services. On  12  March
    2014 he posted  14  cartoons,  mostly  of  men  in  clerical  dress  as
    potentially the supreme leader,  the  president  or  other  influential
    clerics as a puppeteer playing chess with people, having  a  long  nose
    like a liar. On 15 March 2015 he posted photograph of two ropes from  a
    gallows with the post that there were the highest number of  executions
    in Iran in 2013. On 16 March 2014, he posted that  the  supreme  Leader
    Khamenei was a dictator using Islam as  a  tool  with  an  unflattering
    cartoon of him as two-faced or using the current president as a puppet,
    another showing him cutting of the shoots of democracy with the Iranian
    president or other influential  clerics  in  unflattering  or  menacing
    poses. Six more cartoons followed on 31 March  2014  about  hanging  of
    people including, children. Six more cartoons apparently were on prison
    conditions which followed on 24 April 2014. The final post  was  on  19
    May 2014, as already mentioned, was about  the  Iranians  Revolutionary
    guards being drug dealers.

 6. The reality is that these highly  contentious  articles,  cartoons  and
    photographs were being posted once the first appellant arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom. The appellant says he was  excited  by  the  access  to
    previously  forbidden  unavailable  material   but   as   an   educated
    professional man, he must have known that he was posting material which
    showed him as hostile to the regime. He would have known that the  post
    on 20 February 2014 that blasphemy and  insulting  the  State  religion
    carry severe penalties. Calling the supreme  leader  a  dictator  using
    Islam as a tool appears to be his most risky move.  The  appellant  had
    already apparently signed an undertaking in 2011 not to indulge in anti-
    regime activities.

 7. However, the appellant also claimed that he intended to return to  Iran
    for two or three months in July 2014, and then come back to the  United
    Kingdom. Not only was he content to return to Iran but it seems blindly
    naive to do so if he had posted  this  material  on  his  blog  in  the
    knowledge that his name and  photograph  was  on  it,  the  authorities
    monitored the blogs, and there are also informers who may be among  his
    friends and contacts there. The alternative is that he was not  telling
    the truth about intending to visit Iran.

 8. As a graduate accountant who had been a finance director or manager for
    10 years, one would expect him to be able to calculate  the  effect  of
    his actions, including on his wife and son and used to doing  so.  That
    implies that he deliberately  created  an  inflammatory  blog  for  the
    purpose of an asylum application, did not intend to return to  Iran  in
    July 2014, and did not panic on 20 May 2014 as he has claimed. He  also
    conveniently mislaid the family's passports a few days before  then.  I
    have already noted that he handily backed up his blog on the day before
    he claimed that Milad called him from Iran to say  that  the  site  had
    been blocked by the Iranian cyber police and a raid had taken place. On
    the other hand, an educated professional family man can behave stupidly
    and naï¿½vely. It appears to be a dramatic move  to  claim  asylum  on  a
    false premise when he and his family had lawfully leave until  31  July
    2015 with at least the possibility of his wife applying for  a  further
    leave pursuant to Tier 1 or 2 if they wished  to  stay  longer  in  the
    United Kingdom. The only other consideration is whether  something  had
    gone wrong with his marriage at  that  stage  which  is  why  his  wife
    surprisingly did not provide any evidence for the appeals. She  is  not
    in the  position  of  an  uneducated  person  dependent  of  the  first
    appellant for leave to be in the United Kingdom with little evidence to
    offer. Her future also depends upon these  appeals,  and  she  has  her
    son's welfare to consider. However this was not explored.

 9. In my opinion, the first appellant deliberately created an inflammatory
    blog for asylum purposes, or at the very least,  got  so  carried  away
    with the freedom of information that he recklessly  added  knowing  the
    risks he would be running.

10. The site is certainly blocked, and I accept it was his blog. Whether or
    not Milad called him on 20 May 2014, nothing can detract from the  fact
    that  the  site  is  blocked.  According  to  the  translation  of  the
    screenshot, a prosecution is planned or underway,  although  Milad  has
    not called the first appellant to say that an arrest warrant or summons
    has been served. It appears reasonable that  he  would  do  so  from  a
    public phone if he made the earlier to calls for the first appellant. I
    do not regard the issue of whether there was a second raid as more than
    a minor discrepancy as the  first  appellant  explained  it,  that  the
    existence of a second raid adds nothing to the fact that  the  site  is
    blocked in the stated terms. Whether or not Milad actually  phoned,  or
    that is an invention by the first appellant, it again adds  nothing  to
    the actual block of the blog by the cyber police. The fact  that  there
    is no further official documentation  may  simply  be  that  the  cyber
    police are very busy with keeping control  of  social  media  including
    Facebook and Twitter.

11. Background evidence states that the Iranian authorities scrutinise  and
    sensor published material and it states that 5 million  sites  in  Iran
    are blocked. At paragraph 1.3.4 it is stated "the  Iranian  authorities
    to harass, detain, abuse,  torture  and  use  vaguely  worded  criminal
    provisions such as to prosecute and severely punish those  involved  in
    the Internet based media, such as bloggers and users  of  social  media
    where their reporting  is  perceived  to  be  to  be  critical  of  the
    government. Perceived critics... Are likely to  be  held  in  detention
    conditions, some of which are capable of breaching the article  3  ECHR
    threshold".

12. The guidance in the COIS on how wide is the publication, in this appeal
    that becomes less important than the blocking of the site by the  cyber
    police. The fact that they have seen it renders nugatory the number  of
    others which have actually seen it or have been influenced by  it.  The
    guidance also accepts that  a  credible  applicant  in  this  situation
    cannot  obtain  effective  protection  in  Iran,  and  cannot  relocate
    internally.

13. Paragraph 1.3. 6 and 137 also refers to  those  who  indulge  in  anti-
    government activities in the United Kingdom and the assessment  of  sur
    place risk. It notes that the Iranian  authorities  in  the  UK  cannot
    physically monitor the large number of demonstrators so  the  level  of
    actual involvement must be considered. The appellant is in a  different
    situation in that he has been monitored by the cyber  police  in  Iran.
    The country guidance case of BA [2011] UKUT 00036 (IAC) gives  guidance
    on demonstrators and surplus activity. It  states  that  returnees  are
    screened on arrival and  someone  who  fits  the  profile  of  a  known
    activist is likely to be detained,  questioned  and  transferred  to  a
    special court near the airport. However, the success  or  otherwise  of
    the surveillance by the Iranian authorities does not appertain here  as
    the appellant's would be returning under his own name  and  having  had
    travel documents arranged for him and his family. It is not a  question
    of how thorough surveillance is as the cyber surveillance  has  already
    taken place, in the appellant's case.

14. The appellant has  brought  this  on  himself  either  deliberately  or
    recklessly, and in so doing has jeopardised  his  wife  who  has  given
    lawful leave to study in the UK, and the best interests of the  welfare
    of his five-year-old son. The appellant and his family may be let  free
    at their home airport but that is not a  foregone  conclusion  for  the
    second appellant and not quite the point when the  first  appellant  is
    likely to be detained, questioned and subject to prosecution. I am also
    concerned that it is relatively easy for a blogger to post inflammatory
    material once in the United Kingdom and become the cyber equivalent  of
    the demonstrator who stands up in front of a crowd  with  a  loudhailer
    and wearing a brightly coloured clothing  for  a  U-tube  photo  shoot.
    There must be markedly more than 1 million individual  people  in  Iran
    with blocked accounts, and they cannot all come to the United  Kingdom,
    hence my comment about a country guidance case being needed to  reflect
    how the means of publishing  criticism  of  regime  has  changed,  with
    particular relevance to Iran with its repression even  under  President
    Rohani of social media and what might in other societies be regarded as
    fair comment.

15. The Judge allowed the appeals and stated that he accepts that the first
    appellant is at risk of persecution in Iran for his  political  opinion
    and breach of his rights under Article 2 and  3  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention. He stated that the  other  two  appellants,  his  wife  and
    dependent  may  also  face  persecution  for  the  appellant's  imputed
    political opinion and treatment in breach of her Article  3  rights  by
    her intimate association with the first  appellant.  The  appeals  were
    then allowed on "asylum grounds".

16. The grounds of appeal stated as follows which I summarise.  The  appeal
    concerns an Iranian blogger in the United Kingdom as a Tier  4  student
    dependent who the Judge found has either created in  inflammatory  blog
    for asylum purposes or has recklessly added to it knowing the risks  he
    would run. The appeal relates to  the  main  appellant,  his  wife  and
    child, all of whom have been served with  refusal  to  vary  leave  and
    removal directions under section 47.

17. The  Judge  erred  in  her  consideration  of  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant's website had been blocked by the Iranian  cyber  police.  It
    appears to have been accepted by the Judge throughout the determination
    that the website had indeed been blocked by the Iranian  cyber  police.
    This appears to have  emanated  from  the  appellant's  representatives
    contention that the refusal also admitted that its own  enquiry  showed
    that the block had been blocked by the cyber police"  this  is  further
    referenced at paragraph 29 when it was stated that "the decision  maker
    also did not place sufficient weight on the fact that she  had  herself
    verified that the blog address was blocked by the cyber police".

18. The respondent did not make a concession that the Iranian cyber  police
    have blocked the appellant cyber account. It  only  accepted  that  the
    site displayed that it was  blocked.  The  evidence  should  have  been
    considered within the guidance set out in Tanveer Ahmed principles  and
    this should have been  looked  in  the  round  with  the  rest  of  the
    evidence. By treating the comments of the respondent at paragraph 6  of
    the refusal letter  as  a  concession  has  prevented  the  Judge  from
    assessing the evidence that the blog has been blocked  by  the  Iranian
    cyber police in the round. If the Judge had done  that,  she  may  well
    have considered that the appellant had indeed "created  a  very  clever
    forgery of  a  website  that  is  beyond  [her]  technical  ability  to
    discern".  Given  that  the  Judge  found  that   the   appellant   has
    deliberately created the blog for  asylum  purposes  or  has  otherwise
    acted recklessly her credibility findings  at  paragraph  29  are  also
    contingent upon her  acceptance  that  the  Iranian  cyber  police  had
    blocked the website when the Judge stated  at  paragraph  32  that  the
    blocking of the site renders nugatory the question  of  the  degree  of
    publication.

19. The Rule 24 response  stated  the  following  which  I  summarise.  The
    respondent has not identified any distinct legal error from  among  the
    recognised categories of legal error: perversity, poverty of reasoning,
    failing to take account of a material matter, taking immaterial  matter
    into account, failing to resolve a dispute or fact or  opinion,  making
    material misdirection in law, procedural  irregularity,  or  making  an
    inconvertible mistake of fact: in the case of R (Iran)  v  SSHD  [2005]
    EWCA Civ  982  at  paragraph  9,  the  Judge  found  as  a  fact  after
    considering  all  of  the  evidence  in  the  round  that  the  Iranian
    authorities had blocked the appellant's blog. In particular  the  Judge
    considered whether the appellant was incredible at paragraph 26 and  28
    but found  at  paragraph  35  that  he  was  at  risk  of  persecution.
    Alternatively, the appellant stated that the uncontested translation of
    the  screenshot  provided  dated  9  June  2014  confirming  that   the
    appellant's blog was blocked by the Iranian authorities is decisive  of
    his asylum claim and it precludes the respondent by rule  of  law  from
    further seeking to conduct an assessment of the appellant's credibility
    under 339L or article 4 (5) (e) of directive  2004/83  as  a  means  of
    confirming the truth of his asylum claim. The appellant say that it  is
    for the respondent to disprove the case that the blog  was  blocked  by
    the Iranian authorities in order to dispel all doubt that the appellant
    would not be persecuted for political opinion on return.  RC  v  Sweden
    41827/07 [2010] ECHR 307 at paragraph 50 and 53.

20. At the hearing I heard submissions from the parties as to whether there
    is a material error of law in the determination. Mr Tenner stated  that
    the Judge misunderstood the respondent's position as to the issue as to
    whether the appellant's blog was blocked by the Iranian  cyber  police.
    The respondent only accepted that the  appellant  had  a  blog  on  the
    Internet but did not accept that the Iranian cyber police blocked it.

21. Ms Ahmed stated that  there  was  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination which is clear  and  has  taken  all  the  evidence  into
    account. He said that the Judge has given careful consideration to  the
    evidence and made sustainable findings of fact.  The  Judge  took  into
    account the evidence of the photo  shoot  of  the  computer  which  was
    provided which demonstrates that the appellant's website was blocked by
    the Iranian cyber police as stated on the photograph of the website.

22. I have given  anxious  scrutiny  to  the  determination  of  first-tier
    Tribunal Judge to see whether there has been an error of law  which  is
    material. The main ground of appeal is that the  Judge  was  under  the
    false impression that the respondent had accepted  that  these  Iranian
    cyber police had blocked the appellant's website account. This  is  the
    website where the appellant claims that he had posted material critical
    of the Iranian authorities and their supreme leaders.

23. From the reading of the determination,  it  is  clear  that  the  Judge
    accepted, without any analysis that the appellant's  website  had  been
    shut down by the Iranian cyber police. This could  possibly  have  been
    because he was misled by the previous counsel's during his  submissions
    that the respondent had accepted that the appellant had an  account  on
    the Internet which was blocked by the Iranians cyber police.

24. It is  clear  from  the  respondent's  reason  for  refusal  letter  at
    paragraph 26 that the respondent took issue with this fact. The refusal
    letter states the following.  "When a  separate  search  was  done  the
    bloggafa.com it was  displayed  as  a  www.blogafa.com.  This  is  very
    different to the  web  address  that  the  appellant  provided  as  his
    supporting documentary evidence. It is clear from the  reading  of  the
    reasons for refusal letter that the respondent did not accept that  the
    Iranians cyber police had blocked the appellant web  site  and  thereby
    come to the attention of the Iranian authorities for a  successful  sur
    place asylum claim.

25. The Judge found that the evidence suggests that the  appellant  created
    an inflammatory blog on the Internet  for  the  purpose  of  an  asylum
    application as he did not have a profile of an activist while in  Iran.
    It was only  when  he  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  that  he  posted
    inflammatory information about the Iranian  regime  including  cartoons
    depicting the president and Iranian clerics in a very negative  manner.
    The Judge having accepted that the appellant's blog had been shut  down
    by the Iranian cyber police, all analysis and the guidance in BA as  to
    the realistic chances of the appellant blog  being  discovered  by  the
    Iranians cyber police,  he  said  was  rendered  nugatory  because  the
    appellant has provided proof that his website was seen by  the  Iranian
    cyber police who intend to prosecute him. I agree with  the  respondent
    that had the Judge not made this mistake of fact, that  the  respondent
    had accepted that the appellant's blog was shut down, she may well have
    considered that the appellant had indeed "created a very clever forgery
    of a website that is beyond [her] technical ability to  discern".   The
    Judge's failure to make her own findings  as  to  whether  the  Iranian
    cyber police had blocked the appellant's website, led her into material
    error.

26. The Judge did not find the appellant's evidence credible  or  plausible
    on many issues, nevertheless found that the appellant would be at  risk
    on his return to Iran on the sole basis that  the  Iranian  authorities
    had shut down the appellant's blog and  therefore  were  aware  of  the
    appellant's activism while in the United Kingdom.

27. I find there is unreasonableness  and  or  perversity  in  the  Judge's
    analysis of the evidence and the conclusions that he came to  upon  it.
    I find that a material  error  of  law  has  been  established  in  the
    determination.

28. I therefore set aside the determination in its  entirety  and  preserve
    none of the findings. I direct that the appeal  be  placed  before  any
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal for redetermination other than  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge V.A. Lowe.

DECISION
