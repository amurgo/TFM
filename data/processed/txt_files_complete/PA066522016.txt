For the Appellant:     Ms Patel, Counsel, instructed by Amjad Malik
Solicitors
For the Respondent:  Mr Bates (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. She claimed asylum  on  June
       7, 2016 but her application was  refused  on  June  15,  2016  under
       paragraphs 336 and 339F HC 395. On June 28, 2016  she  appealed  the
       removal decision under section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration
       and Asylum Act 2002.

    2. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McCall (hereinafter referred to  as
       the Judge) dismissed her appeal on all grounds on December  7,  2016
       in a decision promulgated on December 21, 2016.

    3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on January 4, 2017 submitting
       the Judge had erred. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  of
       the First-tier Tribunal Page on March 27, 2017 and the  matter  came
       before me on June 30, 2017.

    4. The Judge accepted that the appellant had suffered at the  hands  of
       her father and her former husband and faced a risk, as a  woman,  of
       further harm if she returned to her family home.  Whilst  the  Judge
       considered whether the appellant could return to a place other  than
       the family home his finding that the appellant could live  with  her
       sister was flawed in light of the fact she lived in the same area as
       their father.

    5. I found there was an error of law on this  issue  on  the  issue  of
       internal relocation.


    6. I have preserved the Judge's findings contained in [18] to  [21]  of
       his decision. In summary these are:


      a. The appellant suffered domestic abuse from both her father and  her
         first husband.
      b. The appellant was not  educated  beyond  the  age  of  12,  has  no
         occupational trade and has never worked either in Pakistan  or  the
         United Kingdom.
      c. The appellant is of small build  and  stature  and  is  of  nervous
         disposition.


    7. I adjourned the issue of whether internal relocation  was  available
       and for further consideration of any private/family  life  claim  to
       today and directed that further evidence be adduced to address these
       issues.  It  transpired  that  my  directions,  referred  to  in  my
       decision, were never served on the parties. However,  this  has  not
       prevented me from concluding this appeal today.

    8. I extend the anonymity direction  previously  made  in  this  matter
       pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008.


FRESH EVIDENCE


    9. The appellant adopted her statement made on October  27,  2017.  She
       confirmed her sister and brother-in-law lived in London  with  their
       three children and whilst her brother-in-law worked she  was  unsure
       of his occupation. They maintained  telephone  contact  speaking  at
       least once a week.

   10. Her other sister lived across the road to where her father lived  in
       Pakistan. Whilst her sister was married with five  children  it  was
       not possible for her to return and live  with  her  because  firstly
       they had no room; secondly, they were not rich enough to look  after
       her and thirdly, she lived across the road to  their  father  making
       any return impossible.


   11. She stated her current husband has two brothers in Pakistan and they
       share accommodation with the one of  the  brother's  wife  and  five
       children. The other brother is disabled. They live around 4-5  hours
       away from her own family but she would be unable to live  with  them
       because she neither knew them nor did they have any  room  for  her.
       Whilst her husband has three sisters in Pakistan she had also  never
       met them and they were married with children.


   12. Her husband had lived in the United Kingdom for around 22 years  and
       he supported her. He is 65 years of age  and  they  have  only  gone
       through an Islamic marriage because the respondent would not release
       her passport for a civil ceremony.


   13. Her husband has three children from his first marriage who  are  all
       British. He still sees them once a month albeit they are now adults.
       He also has grandchildren.


   14. Both the appellant and her  husband  stated  that  her  husband  was
       unwilling to return to Pakistan because he had lived and  worked  in
       the United Kingdom for over 22 years  and  now  received  his  State
       Pension. His rent continued to be paid by  the  DWP/Council  as  his
       monthly income was only.


   15. The appellant's husband stated he was not prepared to  accompany  or
       support his wife in Pakistan as he had married  her  here  with  the
       intention of them living together here.


   16. He confirmed that he knew she was here unlawfully  when  they  began
       their relationship but he thought that if they married he would  try
       his best to ensure she would  be  allowed  to  remain.  Whilst  they
       discussed the possibility she would have her application refused  he
       stated that he would keep trying to ensure she could remain although
       he accepted that if she was returned to Pakistan he would  then  try
       to secure her re-entry to the United Kingdom.

SUBMISSIONS

   17. Mr Bates submitted that there was no reason why the appellant  could
       not relocate to her husband's village which was  between  4-5  hours
       away from where she used to live. There was no evidence  her  father
       or former husband's family had the means to seek  her  out.  It  was
       open to the appellant to return to Pakistan with her husband who was
       a Pakistani national albeit with a right of residence in the  United
       Kingdom. There was nothing actually preventing them returning  apart
       from choice. This did  not  amount  to  an  insurmountable  obstacle
       especially as he had acknowledged in his oral evidence that he  knew
       his wife  had  no  right  to  remain  here  when  they  began  their
       relationship. Her status had been both unlawful and  precarious  and
       she had demonstrated no ability to speak English  and  a  Judge  had
       previously found she had never worked and was uneducated  since  the
       age of twelve. She could return either with her husband or  continue
       to be supported by him  in  Pakistan,  as  she  was  in  the  United
       Kingdom. Mr Bates invited me to  dismiss  both  the  protection  and
       family/private life claims.


   18. Ms Patel adopted the skeleton argument  lodged  by  her  instructing
       solicitors. Looking at her characteristics she submitted it would be
       unsafe for the appellant to be returned as she had nowhere  to  live
       and no means of support and as a  lone  female  she  would  face  an
       increased risk of  persecution.  The  oral  evidence  was  that  her
       husband's family would not welcome her and  in  those  circumstances
       her appeal must succeed. Alternatively, she submitted the  appellant
       and her husband lived together in a relationship akin to a marriage.
       Whilst  his  income  did  not  satisfy  the  ï¿½18,600  threshold  she
       submitted that there were exceptional and  compelling  circumstances
       to allow the appeal under article 8 ECHR. She argued the husband was
       financially independent and had lived here for over 22 years and  to
       refuse her permission to remain would be disproportionate.


FINDINGS


   19. This is a resumed hearing the purpose of which to  was  to  consider
       firstly whether the appellant can reasonably be expected to stay  in
       a different part of Pakistan and if  it  is  whether  removal  would
       breach her rights to family and/or private life in this country.

   20. I have considered the appellant's claim from the starting point that
       she cannot return to her home village and this would therefore  rule
       out a return to  her  sister's  house  because  she  lived  a  short
       distance away from their father.


   21. Applying paragraph 339O HC 395 I have  to  ask  myself  whether  she
       would be safe in another part of Pakistan and secondly  whether  she
       could reasonably be expected to live there.


   22. Ms Patel's argument is that she would not be safe and  my  attention
       was drawn to the country evidence contained at pages 213 to  221  of
       the recent bundle.


   23. It is accepted that women in Pakistan can form part of a  particular
       social group but in this appeal there  are  two  additional  factual
       matters I have to take into account namely (a) the appellant is  now
       married under Islamic law and (b) her husband has family who live  a
       considerable distance asway from the appellant's father.


   24. Ms Patel's submission is that I should ignore these factors  because
       (a) her husband has made it clear he would not accompany her back to
       Pakistan and (b) her husband's family neither want her nor have  the
       room for her


   25. It is wrong to suggest the appellant is a single  woman  because  on
       her own admission she is married to a Pakistani national who  could,
       is he wished, accompany her to Pakistan and live there with  her  as
       husband  and  wife.  Whilst  her  husband   has   acquired   British
       citizenship the fact remains he is a Pakistani national and he still
       has siblings living in  Pakistan  with  whom  he  maintains  regular
       contact.


   26. The country evidence relied on by Ms Patel assumes the appellant  is
       a single female and has no male person to turn to in Pakistan.  That
       is not the case. She  has  her  husband  and  her  husband's  family
       contains male members.


   27. I am satisfied there are areas in Pakistan where the appellant could
       go to. She does not have to return alone. Both the appellant and her
       husband  made  it  clear  they  are  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
       relationship so clearly return with her husband remains  an  option.
       There is also the option she could go and stay  with  her  husband's
       family in Pakistan.


   28. I set today's hearing up to consider whether she  could  return  and
       whilst I have the oral/written evidence from the appellant  and  her
       husband I note the appellant's bundle lacks any  evidence  from  the
       sisters or brothers. There was no suggestion their relationship  has
       not  been  accepted  by  them  and  I  am  satisfied  it  suits  the
       appellant's case to say they will not accept her at their home.


   29. In  considering  whether  internal  relocation  is  available  I  am
       satisfied there is another part of Pakistan she can return to and it
       would be reasonable to expect her to do so. I accordingly find  that
       the appellant's protection claims should be dismissed.


   30. I turn now to the private and family life claim. Ms Patel's argument
       before the First-tier Tribunal was that the appellant could  succeed
       under Section EX.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  on  the
       basis there were "insurmountable obstacles" to her living  with  her
       husband in Pakistan.


   31. With respect to the appellant  these  arguments  do  not  amount  to
       insurmountable obstacles. They are reasons and excuses why she  does
       not want to live in Pakistan but there  is  nothing  preventing  the
       appellant  and  her  husband  living  together  in   Pakistan.   The
       Immigration Rules require me  to  consider  whether  there  are  any
       insurmountable obstacles to them living in Pakistan.  Based  on  the
       fact the appellant and her husband are of Pakistani origin  and  her
       husband has siblings still living there I am  satisfied  that  there
       are no insurmountable obstacles to her return.


   32. Similarly, when considering private life under paragraph  276ADE  HC
       395 I am satisfied there are no "very significant obstacles" to  her
       return. The appellant has not identified any particular private life
       and her husband is now retired. Allowing her  to  stay  because  her
       husband would not be able to see his friends as often  as  he  would
       wish does not amount to a "very significant obstacle".


   33. Her appeal falls to be considered under article 8 ECHR and I  accept
       the appeal can be considered under this heading because her  husband
       has lived here for over 22 years. He is now 65  and  whilst  he  has
       lived one third of his life in this country he has spent two  thirds
       of his life with his family in Pakistan.


   34. Paragraph 117B of the 2002 Act applies in this  appeal  and  most  I
       must have regard to the following factors when considering the issue
       of proportionality:


      a. The importance of immigration control.
      b. The parties  commenced  their  relationship  at  a  time  when  the
         appellant had been here  both  unlawfully  and  precariously.  They
         entered into their relationship in full knowledge of  her  unlawful
         and precarious immigration status.
      c. The appellant does not speak English and has no financial resources
         of her own. The appellant is wholly reliant on her husband's  state
         pension which amounts to around ï¿½8,000 per annum which is far below
         the ï¿½18,600 threshold set by  the  Government  in  the  Immigration
         Rules. Her husband relies on state support for his rent.
      d. She cannot meet the Immigration Rules or Section EX.1  of  Appendix
         FM of the Immigration Rules.
      e. There is family to turn to in Pakistan.


   35. Ms Patel invited me to place weight  on  the  fact  the  appellant's
       husband has said he would not accompany her. The fact  remains  they
       married in full knowledge the appellant would be refused  permission
       to remain here and when questioned by me the husband stated that  he
       effectively hoped her application would succeed but if  she  had  to
       return he would continue to try and bring her back to this country.

   36. The Government when introducing Section 117B into  statute  made  it
       clear that these are statutory factors I must have regard to. Whilst
       an ability to speak English and to be  financially  independent  are
       neutral factors great weight must be placed on a family and  private
       life formed whilst here unlawfully. This is exactly what I  have  in
       this case.


   37. Given my other  findings  I  am  satisfied  that  it  would  not  be
       disproportionate to remove the appellant given the above factors.


DECISION

   38. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I previously set aside the
       decision and now remake it by dismissing the appellant's appeals for
       protection and under article 8 ECHR.
