                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  This  is  the  appeal  of  Masouda  Shahrwand  Ahmadi,  a  citizen  of
    Afghanistan born 30 June 1993, against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Geraint Jones QC) of 23 November 2018  to  dismiss  her
    appeal, itself brought against the Respondent's decision of 27 November
    2017 to refuse her application to join her partner in  the  UK  as  his
    spouse.




  Introduction

 2. The Appellant married her husband, Ahmad Ahmadi, on 14  November  2014.
    She applied for entry clearance as a partner under Appendix  FM  on  21
    August 2017.

 3. The application was refused, because  whilst  the  genuineness  of  the
    relationship was accepted, it was not established  that  the  financial
    requirements were met, because Mrs Ahmadi had stated that  her  husband
    was employed as a sales assistant by  Sun  Foods  Ltd  with  an  annual
    salary of �17,687.64, below the �18,600 threshold; that  assertion  was
    inconsistent with the supporting letter from his employers  stating  he
    earned �19,000 annually. It was unclear who had signed that letter. The
    payslips recorded that he was paid in cash, but some deposits had  been
    made in the name of Sunroads Ltd.

  The First-tier Tribunal decision

 4. Relevant supporting evidence  placed  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    included

      a) A letter from the Halifax stating that a deposit of  10  July  2017
         was wrongly typed in as Sunroads Ltd rather than Sun Foods Ltd;

      b) P60s from Sun Foods stating Mr Ahmadi  earned  �18,999.96  for  the
         year ended 5 April 2018 and �7,557.99 for the year  ended  5  April
         2017;

      c) A letter from the Appellant's employer confirming monthly  earnings
         amounting  to  �9,499.98  over  the  six  months  leading  to   the
         application date.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the witness statement  from  the
    Sponsor did not adequately  explain  how  it  was  that  the  financial
    requirements  were  met  at  the  relevant  date,  being  the  date  of
    application. It noted that Mrs Ahmadi had stated her husband's  claimed
    earnings with  extreme  precision,  giving  a  figure  that  could  not
    reasonably considered to be an estimate, contrary to his suggestion  in
    evidence that she had not known  his  exact  earnings.  It  was  highly
    probable that he did not earn more  than  the  relevant  threshold  via
    earnings  in  the  six  months  preceding  the  application  given  the
    discrepancies in the evidence. The  Respondent  had  been  entitled  to
    conclude that the  earnings  threshold  was  not  met  given  that  the
    payslips from January to July 2017 showed gross earnings of �11,083.11.
    P60s could never demonstrate the actual earnings throughout a given tax
    year, as opposed to simply stating the annual earnings total.

  Onwards appeal

 6. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  materially
    erred in law because the Judge

      a) Wrongly stated that the letter  from  the  Sponsor's  employer  was
         dated 15 August 2070, when it was in fact dated 15 August 2017, and
         had stated that the letter described the company as  Sun  Food  Ltd
         (rather than Foods);

      b) Failed to appreciate that the bank statements in fact  showed  that
         the P60 for the year ended 5 April 2017 was wholly consistent  with
         representing three months of an annual  salary  exceeding  �18,600,
         whereas that  for  the  year  ending  5  April  2018  demonstrating
         earnings that expressly exceeded �18,600;

      c) Erred in the consideration of the case  outside  the  Rules,  given
         that, taking  the  appropriate  approach  outside  the  Immigration
         Rules, the evidence clearly did show that  the  earnings  threshold
         was met at the date of hearing, via the  Sponsor's  earnings  as  a
         taxi driver, bearing in mind the public interest represented by the
         contribution he made to  the  community,  and  the  fact  that  the
         section 117B factors were in the Appellant's favour.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on 8 January 2018  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the basis that arguably inconsistent findings had been made
    on the evidence, and the Judge might be read as having thought  Article
    8  was  to  be  considered  only  if  there  were  special  or  unusual
    circumstances in play.

 8. Before me, Ms Walker for the Appellant submitted that the matter  which
    had most concerned  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  being  the  discrepancy
    between the rather precise earnings  stated  for  the  Sponsor  by  the
    Appellant in her application form,  had  in  fact  arisen  because  the
    Appellant had made her own calculation of those earnings by taking  the
    net monthly earnings shown by the pay slips and simply multiplying that
    figure by twelve. Inevitably that gave a figure  which  was  incorrect,
    albeit one that was very precisely stated.  In  reality  the  specified
    documents required by the Rules were before the First-tier Tribunal and
    it failed to appreciate this. Mr Melvin  for  the  Secretary  of  State
    stated he felt unable to seriously resist the appeal given the contents
    of the documents upon which the Appellant relied.

  Decision and reasons

 9. It seems to me that there was material error of  law  in  the  decision
    below. The  crux  of  the  Appellant's  case  was  that  the  financial
    requirements were here met. When one reads the relevant  components  of
    Appendix FM-SE, it is apparent that they are indeed met. There are  six
    months of bank statements which record the  receipt  of  cash  payments
    that accord with the six months of payslips, all of which is consistent
    with the employer's letter.

10. Unfortunately the First-tier Tribunal appears to have  been  distracted
    by matters others than those shown  by  the  documents.  There  was  no
    challenge to the authenticity of the earnings that was  sustainable  on
    the material before it; the bank had themselves written to  confirm  an
    error in transcribing the origin of the payment  which  had  originally
    concerned the Entry Clearance Officer.

11. I accordingly consider that there was a material error of  law  in  the
    decision appealed, by way of the making of a significant error of  fact
    as to the contents of the evidence  before  the  Judge  for  which  the
    Appellant was not responsible. The error  goes  to  the  heart  of  the
    appeal, which must accordingly be  re-determined.  The  parties  agreed
    that it was appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to finally determine the
    issue here and now.

12. The various sources confirming the earnings unite in confirming monthly
    earnings which over six months equal �9,499.98, a sum  of  money  which
    would equate to annualised earnings of virtually �19,000, plainly  more
    than �18,600. Accordingly the Immigration Rules were satisfied  on  the
    sole  matter  as  to  which  the  Respondent   refused   the   original
    application.

13. Of course, this is an appeal on human rights grounds  rather  than  one
    that  focusses  on   the   Immigration   Rules   alone.   Nevertheless,
    satisfaction of the Rules takes one a  long  way  towards  establishing
    that a refusal is disproportionate. Sir Ernest Ryder in  TZ  (Pakistan)
    and PG (India) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 �35 stated:

         "The policy of the Secretary of State as expressed in the Rules  is
         not to be ignored when a decision about article 8  is  to  be  made
         outside the Rules. An evaluation of the question whether there  are
         insurmountable obstacles is a relevant factor because  considerable
         weight is to be placed  on  the  Secretary  of  State's  policy  as
         reflected in the Rules of the  circumstances  in  which  a  foreign
         national partner should be granted leave to  remain.  ...  where  a
         person satisfies the Rules, whether  or  not  by  reference  to  an
         article 8  informed  requirement,  then  this  will  be  positively
         determinative of that person's article  8  appeal,  provided  their
         case engages article 8(1), for the very reason that it  would  then
         be disproportionate for that person to be removed."

14. Having regard to that authority,  and  noting  that  the  section  117B
    factors do not militate against the grant of leave, given the Appellant
    satisfied  the  English  language  criteria  on  her  application,  has
    demonstrated financial independence to the standard set by  the  Rules,
    and made an appropriate application for entry clearance from abroad,  I
    find that  the  decision  against  which  the  appeal  was  brought  is
    disproportionate to the family life with which it interfered.  I  allow
    the appeal.

    Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law.

    The appeal is allowed on Human Rights Convention grounds.
