                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Kelly made
    following a hearing at Bradford on 21st June 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq born  on  21st  January  1986.   She
    applied for entry clearance to come to the  UK  as  a  spouse  but  was
    refused under paragraphs 281 and 320(7A) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The initial decision was made in June 2012 but never served.   A  fresh
    decision, and the subject of this appeal, was made on 7th October 2012.
     The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the  Appellant  was
    married to a person present and settled in the  UK  nor  that  she  had
    passed an English language test in speaking  and  listening  from  ESOL
    approved by the Secretary of  State  for  this  purpose  nor  that  she
    intended to live permanently with her partner and that the marriage was
    subsisting and finally that she would not be maintained  adequately  in
    the UK without recourse to public funds.

 4. Judge Kelly found in favour of all aspects of the Appellant's case save
    for maintenance.  He  was  satisfied  that  the  couple  were  lawfully
    married and that, since a child had been conceived,  the  marriage  was
    subsisting as at the date of decision and the couple intended permanent
    cohabitation as spouses.  He was also satisfied, in view of  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager's concession that the  Appellant's  English  language
    certificate was valid as at the date  she  sat  the  test,  that  those
    requirements of the Rules were met.

 5. The judge recorded that the Sponsor's original plan had  been  to  wait
    with his new bride in Jordan pending the grant of her  application  for
    entry clearance.  He had been working for Kam Jeans and City Valets and
    sought and was granted leave of absence from work by his employers  for
    a total of four weeks, three weeks of which  were  paid.   However  the
    processing of the application took much longer  than  the  Sponsor  had
    anticipated.

 6. He wrote:

         "Having informed  his  respective  employers  of  the  position  by
         telephone he understood that, whilst neither  employment  would  be
         held open for him pending the uncertain date of his return, each of
         his employers would nevertheless be happy to re-engage him if there
         happened to be a vacancy at that time."

 7. He recorded that the Sponsor returned to the UK on 4th October 2012 and
    did in fact take up employment again with his previous employers.

 8. The judge wrote as follows:

         "At paragraphs 10 and 11 of a witness statement  that  he  prepared
         for the purpose of these  proceedings  the  Appellant  purports  to
         confirm that he had resumed his employment with Kam Jeans and  City
         Valets by the date of the decision.  This does not  however  accord
         with his oral testimony at the hearing and neither does  it  accord
         with the documentary evidence that is before me.  Both of these are
         to the effect that the Appellant was only re-engaged by his  former
         employers after the decision (see for example the letter  from  the
         proprietor of City Valets dated 13th June 2013 which clearly states
         that the Sponsor resumed his employment with them on  13th  October
         2012).  I therefore find that the Appellant was without  employment
         or income at the date of the decision and that re-engagement by his
         former employers (as in fact subsequently  occurred)  was  at  that
         time far from assured."

The Grounds of Application

 9. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    made a mistake of fact in using the word 're-engage' because that  word
    had not been mentioned by  either  of  the  two  employers.  The  judge
    misunderstood the  clear  documentary  and  oral  evidence.   The  word
    'resume' correctly identifies what the Sponsor was doing  by  taking  a
    break from employment whilst abroad and resuming upon return to the UK.
     The basis of  the  finding  that  the  Sponsor's  ability  to  provide
    adequate financial support for himself and the Appellant was  far  from
    assured and was not supported by the evidence.  No end date for each of
    the respective employments was ever provided and no P45 was ever issued
    by either of the employers.  Moreover, within  the  letter  dated  13th
    June 2013, City Valets state, "the period of absence  was  due  to  his
    travel to Jordan to meet his wife".  This confirms the  assertion  that
    the time abroad  was  absence  from  employment  and  not  the  end  of
    employment or re-employment.  The other letter,  dated  11th  May  2012
    confirmed that the job was secure and permanent.  No challenge was made
    either in the grounds or in submissions to the decision in  respect  of
    Article 8.

10. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Designated  Judge  Murray
    on 16th July 2013 but  upon  application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy on 14th August 2013.

11. The Respondent was not able to serve a reply because the  determination
    was not attached to the grant of permission.

Submissions

12. At the hearing Mr Diwnycz initially maintained that  the  determination
    was sustainable, referring to the reference at paragraph 6 to enquiries
    having been made at the Department for Work and Pensions to the  effect
    that the Sponsor was in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance from 23rd April
    2012 to 2nd May 2012.

13. Mr Ahmed had never seen the  report  from  the  DWP  and  briefly  took
    instructions from the Sponsor who strenuously denied that he  had  ever
    claimed Jobseekers Allowance.  I offered Mr Ahmed the opportunity of an
    adjournment so that the  Sponsor  could  obtain  his  own  evidence  in
    relation to benefits which he had claimed in the past.

14. That proved unnecessary because Mr Diwnycz told  me  that  he  was  not
    relying on the document because the decision letter of October made  no
    reference to it although the one in June had done.

15. On that basis he accepted that the judge had erred in law both  because
    he had made reference to the document from the DWP which was not relied
    upon by the Respondent  and  because  of  the  reasons  stated  in  the
    grounds.

16. The decision is set  aside  because  the  judge  relied  on  irrelevant
    material namely a document submitted in relation to  a  decision  which
    was never served and superseded by a decision which made  no  reference
    to it.

Findings and Conclusions

17. Mr Diwnycz indicated that he had no wish to cross-examine the  Sponsor.
    He relied on the Entry Clearance Officer's decision which  stated  that
    the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the Sponsor  was  in
    receipt of the income stated or in the employment claimed.

18. The Sponsor's evidence is that he had  been  employed  as  a  warehouse
    assistant with Kam Jeanswear Limited since September  2009  earning  on
    average �752.19 per month.  He has provided a number of  payslips  from
    Kam Jeanswear, including for the period after he went to  Jordan  which
    are marked  "holiday  pay".   He  was  also  employed  part-time  as  a
    warehouse assistant with City Valets  earning  approximately  �115  per
    week, making a total weekly income from both jobs of �304.38 per  week.



19. No issue was taken by the  judge  who  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    Sponsor in relation to whether he was working as claimed and Mr Diwnycz
    stated that he did not wish to cross-examine the Sponsor about  whether
    he had been genuinely working.

20. Neither was  any  issue  taken  with  the  adequacy  of  the  Sponsor's
    earnings. His total  weekly  outgoings  as  set  out  in  the  schedule
    produced after the hearing were �131.48  including  rent,  Council  tax
    food and utility bills. His disposable weekly income was �172.90,  well
    above the income support level for a couple.

21. The sole issue was whether he had in fact given up  employment  in  May
    2012 and then was fortunate enough to be re-engaged or whether  he  had
    an agreement that he could take paid and unpaid leave  before  resuming
    his employment with the two companies.

22. The letter from City Valets, in referring  to  a  "period  of  absence"
    clearly indicates that it was the intention of both  parties  that  the
    Sponsor would be resuming his  employment  upon  return.   The  Sponsor
    strenuously denied that he had given evidence to  the  effect  that  he
    understood that neither employment would be held open for  him,  and  I
    can see nothing in the judge's Record of Proceedings which  casts  that
    into doubt.

23. The letter from Kam Jeanswear is more ambivalent and is written in  the
    past tense.  However the clear evidence  from  the  Sponsor,  which  Mr
    Diwnycz decided not to challenge by way of cross-examination  was  that
    he simply resumed his previous employment when he returned from  Jordan
    which was always his and his employer's intention.

24. As at the date of decision he could  properly  be  described  as  being
    employed by them.

25. That being the sole issue in the appeal, it should be allowed.  However
    the Sponsor would be wise to obtain confirmation from the DWP  that  he
    did not claim  Jobseekers  Allowance  at  any  relevant  period  since,
    although this was not an issue in the appeal before me  it  may  be  of
    concern when an Entry Clearance Officer is considering whether to issue
    entry clearance.

Decision

26. The decision of the judge is set aside.  It is re-made as follows.  The
    Appellant's appeal is allowed.
