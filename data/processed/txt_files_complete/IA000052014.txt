For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss J Smeaton, Counsel instructed by Healys LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but I shall refer to the parties as they  were  described  before
    the First-tier Tribunal that is Miss Dapilaga, the appellant,  and  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2.  The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born on 11 September1979
    and she appealed against the decision to refuse to vary  her  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom and to remove her  by  way  of  directions
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 3. The appellant was initially  granted  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student but her leave was curtailed to expire  on  20  August
    2013 and on that date she applied for leave to remain as a partner.

 4. In a Reasons for Refusal Letter the Secretary of State noted  that  the
    appellant had applied as a partner as defined in  paragraph  GEN1.2  of
    Appendix FM but it appeared that she had  only  been  living  with  her
    partner at Atiszamir since January 2013 and therefore  did  not  fulfil
    the definition of a partner and could  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Section R-LTRP.

 5.  The  application  was  refused  under  paragraph  D-LTRP.1.1  of   the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. The Secretary of State was not satisfied EX.1 applied as  she  did  not
    have children.

 7. Further it was maintained that she had not lived in the UK  for  twenty
    years under Rule 276ADE and she had spent 28 years of her life  in  the
    Philippines and  in  the  absence  of  evidence  to  the  contrary  the
    Secretary of State did not accept that she had lost her ties  with  her
    home country.

 8.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Martins  allowed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds on 30th May 2014.

 9. An application for permission to appeal was made by  the  Secretary  of
    State on the basis that the appellant did not satisfy the  requirements
    of the partner as set out in GEN1.2 of Appendix FM.  This  stated  that
    "partner" means

    (i)  the applicant's spouse;

    (ii) the applicant's civil partner;

    (iii)    the applicant's fianc� or proposed civil partner, or

    (iv) a person who has been living together  with  the  applicant  in  a
         relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for  at  least
         two years prior to the date of the application.

10. The Secretary of State submitted that the individual  circumstances  of
    the  appellant  and  her  sponsor  did  not  fall  within  any  of  the
    definitions outlined above and as such the appellant could not  satisfy
    GEN1.2 and could not benefit from paragraph EX.1 which is not  a  stand
    alone provision.

11. Further there was a material misdirection of law under Article 8.   The
    judge found that it was of note that the appellant had always abided by
    the Immigration Rules, having arrived as a student.  The  Secretary  of
    State submitted that this should not enhance her human rights claim  as
    per Nasim & Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025.  The appellant  as  a
    student was aware that her stay  in  the  UK  was  only  temporary  and
    therefore could have no legitimate expectation she would remain  beyond
    her studies.

12. The judge concluded there were insurmountable obstacles to family  life
    continuing in Pakistan or in the  Philippines  and  cited  difficulties
    with  language  culture  as  the  predominant  reason  along  with  the
    appellant's concerns over the husband's death threats.   The  Secretary
    of State submitted that in either case the partners  could  assist  one
    another with integrating in the respective societies.  The  judge  made
    no findings on the practicalities of relocation or why the appellant or
    partner could not avail themselves of protection of the state.

13. The difficulties raised by  the  appellant  and  her  sponsor  did  not
    disclose insurmountable obstacles rather they  disclosed  the  ordinary
    difficulties that people may face in establishing a new life in another
    country and there was nothing to suggest that  the  fundamental  rights
    would  be  breached  by  a  decision  to  relocate  nor  that  it   was
    unjustifiably harsh.

14. Therefore the judge took a divergent view to the authority  established
    in Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT  640
    and Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC  720
    by not applying the correct assessment of the compelling  factors  that
    she made a material error.

15. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Lambert who  noted  that  the
    permission to appeal was made out of time.

16. The reason given for the late filing of the  appeal  was  a  "temporary
    lack of resources" which would not  normally  be  adequate  reason  for
    failing to comply with time limits

17. The judge continued "time is however extended because the grounds  have
    merit".

The Hearing

18. At the hearing it was submitted by Miss Smeaton that there had  been  a
    further application for judicial review proceedings of the decision  of
    Judge Lambert to grant permission to appeal out of time.   The  grounds
    argue that the  Tribunal  acted  unreasonably  in  extending  time  and
    referred the Tribunal to the determination in BO & Others (extension of
    time for appealing) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00035.

19. Miss Smeaton requested that the proceedings before me be stayed on  the
    basis that this application had been submitted.

20. I note this is the second time that an application for judicial  review
    proceedings have been submitted and Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Latter  not
    only considered the previous application for  judicial  review  against
    the wrong party (the Secretary of State was named rather than the First-
    tier Tribunal) but he also stated that he was not satisfied that it was
    arguable that the decision to extend time was not a  decision  properly
    open to the judge.

21. Judge Latter stated that Judge Lambert's decision was "consistent  with
    the guidance given in BO & Others.  He stated there was  no  reason  to
    believe that the judge did not take into account all relevant  material
    before reaching his decision.

22. I concluded that there was merely a renewed application for  permission
    to appeal and I was not persuaded to stay the proceedings before me.

23. At the hearing I pointed out that it was  an  obvious  point  that  the
    appellant could not succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules  further  to
    ELTRP1.12 as a fianc�e as she had been in the UK on a Tier 4  (General)
    Student visa and had not entered the  UK  as  a  fianc�e.   During  the
    course of the proceedings Mr Avery made an  application  to  amend  the
    grounds for application for permission to appeal which I grant.

24. The judge notes at paragraph 49 of her determination  that  the  couple
    did not actually start living together to any  extent  until  2013  and
    therefore they cannot  comply  with  GEN1.2  as  they  have  not  lived
    together akin to a marriage for at least two years prior to the date of
    the application.

25. I therefore find there was an error of law in the judge's determination
    in relation to the Immigration Rules.

26. I turn to a consideration of the human rights grounds  and  acknowledge
    that the determination may have been set out more clearly but  do  note
    that the judge considered  the  Immigration  Rules  and  cited  Gulshan
    (article 8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640.

27. As was pointed out the case of Nasim & Others (Article 8)  [2014]  UKUT
    apply to education cases and in this case  the  judge  had  found  that
    there was a genuine and subsisting relationship between the parties not
    least that they live together now and she had suffered a miscarriage of
    a baby in 2011.  To this extent I am not persuaded that  Nasim  assists
    the respondent's case.

28. Clearly it is open to the judge to take into  account  the  immigration
    history of the appellant and indeed this is particularly  important  in
    relation to decisions following Nagre where the concept  of  precarious
    immigration history and developing a relationship within the context of
    a precarious immigration status was highly relevant.  The appellant may
    not be able to fulfil  the  Immigration  Rules  as  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing but the fact that she has remained in the country  and
    regularised her status as the judge identified at paragraph 52 is  very
    relevant.

29. The question of insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  in
    Pakistan or the Philippines,  as  the  judge  identified  do  not  mean
    obstacles which were impossible to surmount but  go  to  the  practical
    difficulties of relocation.

30. Nonetheless, at paragraph 55 the judge stated "it  was  argued  in  the
    alternative that there  are  compelling  circumstances  which  make  an
    arguable case  for  considering  the  application's  Article  8  rights
    outside the Immigration Rules."  At this point the judge states, "given
    the features outlined above, I believe there are".  Here the judge  had
    identified the difficulties of being a Christian in  Pakistan  and  the
    requirement for her to convert and secondly  the  difficulties  of  the
    language barrier.

31. The judge also identified that the appellant's husband was  settled  in
    the UK and that he had close family in the UK and worked here.   Indeed
    the judge recorded that he owned his own business and in the  light  of
    his very strong connections with the UK and the number of years he  had
    lived here (although I note the judge erred in  stating  he  had  lived
    here for twenty years) I find that the judge did set out  reasoning  as
    to why she found there were compelling reasons for allowing the  appeal
    under Article 8.

32. The judge did err in concluding that in fact  the  appellant  fulfilled
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules but I do not find  that  this
    affected her decision in relation to Article  8  which  she  considered
    separately.  The judge also took into account the  appellant's  private
    life but it was in relation to her family life  that  she  granted  the
    appeal. In MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985 the Court upheld the approach in MF  (Nigeria)  and
    at  paragraph  130  stated  that  it   was   necessary   to   apply   a
    proportionality test in order to be compatible with the  ECHR  and  the
    judge found that interference would  not  be  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim.

33. I find that  the  objections  by  the  Secretary  of  State  were  mere
    disagreements with the judge's finding and although those  findings  by
    the judge might have been set out more clearly, I find that there is no
    error of law which is material.  The case of MM Miss Smeaton  submitted
    indicated that Gulshan was wrongly decided.  I do not accept this but I
    do not find that there was an error allowing the appeal on human rights
    grounds.

34. In respect of the Immigration Rules only  and  for  the  reasons  given
    above I set the decision aside and dismiss the appeal  in  relation  to
    the Immigration Rules. However, I found that there is no material error
    of law in the determination regarding the human rights  claim  and  the
    decision shall stand in respect of human rights only.
