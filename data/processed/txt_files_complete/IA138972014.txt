                                              Decision & Reasons Promulgated
                                                          On 13 January 2014

                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KOPIECZEK


                                   Between

                             ERIK ROBERT MILLER
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

 1. The appellant has an appeal outstanding before the Upper  Tribunal.  By
    letter dated 12 January 2015 the appellant states  that  he  wishes  to
    withdraw the appeal.

 2. Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  provides
    that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case or any  part
    of it, subject to the consent  of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  There  is  no
    provision for a party to withdraw the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.
    Therefore, the letter from the appellant can serve only as a notice  of
    withdrawal of his case before the Upper Tribunal, to  which  the  Upper
    Tribunal now consents.

 3. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

 4. The applicant also requests that his documents be returned as  soon  as
    possible, but he does not identify those documents or suggest  that  it
    is the Upper Tribunal that is in possession of them.
