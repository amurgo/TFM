                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  brought  with
    permission granted by a Judge of the Upper Tribunal, against a decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Saffer  hereinafter  "the  judge"),
    promulgated  on  1st  May  2015,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision of 4th December 2014 refusing to  vary  leave  to
    enter and deciding to remove her from the UK by way of directions under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.



The Factual Background

 2. The Appellant was born on [ ] 1965.  She is a national of Eritrea.  She
    is married to one [ZT], who is a naturalised British citizen but who is
    also from Eritrea.  I am not sure precisely when it was  that  the  two
    married but it was many years ago and at a time when both were residing
    in Eritrea.  However, the Appellant's  husband  left  that  country  in
    2002.  It is said that he had  been  detained  by  the  authorities  in
    Eritrea for political reasons  but  that  he  managed  to  escape.   He
    entered the UK in 2002 and claimed asylum.  In due course, in fact on a
    date in 2007, he was granted indefinite leave to remain.

 3. The Appellant and her husband have two children.  The eldest, [S], came
    to the UK with his father (the Appellant's husband) in 2002 when he was
    aged 12.  He has subsequently become a naturalised British citizen  and
    has employment in the UK as a doctor.  They have  another  child,  [T],
    who is also now an adult and who lives  in  the  UK,  and  there  is  a
    further child [Y], who is not the natural child of the couple but  who,
    it is said, has been treated as a child of the family.  He was born  on
    3rd May 2000 and is said to be the  Appellant's  nephew.   It  is  also
    indicated that he became an orphan in 2004 and that, thereafter, he has
    been looked after  by  the  Appellant  in  Eritrea  and,  now,  by  the
    Appellant and her husband in the UK.

 4. As I understand it, applications for entry clearance were made  by  the
    Appellant for herself and for [T]  and  [Y]  at  the  same  time.   The
    applications  of  the  Appellant  and  [T]  were  successful  and  they
    subsequently received a grant of limited  leave  until  November  2014.
    The application for [Y] was initially refused but that  was  overturned
    on appeal, his having successfully relied in that appeal upon Article 8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  The intention  was,
    of course, that all of them would eventually settle in the UK and would
    receive a grant of leave entitling them to do so.

 5. The Appellant, in coming to the UK then, was reunited with her  husband
    and [S].  In turn, [T] and [Y] were reunited with [S]  and  with  their
    father (though of course [ZT] is not the natural father of  [Y]).   The
    application for entry clearance which had been made  by  the  Appellant
    whilst in Eritrea, and which was successful, was considered  under  the
    Immigration Rules in the form they were in  prior  to  the  substantial
    changes which were made in July 2012 and which impacted  significantly,
    amongst other things, with respect to the maintenance and accommodation
    requirements.  Ms Anderson indicated to me that that was  the  position
    and Mr Diwnycz did not disagree.

 6. Having been successful  in  her  initial  applications,  the  Appellant
    applied for further leave to remain but this led to the decision of 4th
    December 2014 refusing to vary leave and deciding to  remove  her  from
    the UK.  The basis of the decision was that the Appellant had failed to
    meet the English language requirements and the maintenance requirements
    as  contained  within  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Respondent  also
    considered the application under Article 8 of the ECHR  but  said  that
    the requirements of the Rules with respect to family life as  contained
    in Appendix FM were not met and nor were the requirements for Article 8
    under  the  Immigration  Rules  with  respect  to  private  life.   The
    Respondent considered whether there were any exceptional  circumstances
    which might warrant consideration of a grant of leave to remain outside
    the Immigration Rules but concluded that there were not.

 7. The Appellant, disappointed with that outcome, appealed to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.



The First-tier Tribunal's Consideration of the Appeal

 8. There was an oral hearing which took place on 30th April 2015 at  which
    both parties were represented.  Oral evidence was given.  Some  of  the
    arguments before the judge  focused  upon  what  was  said  to  be  the
    Appellant's husband's inability  to  "ever  earn  �18,600  due  to  his
    health" and some related to the particular situation of  [Y],  still  a
    minor, who had his own outstanding application for leave to remain.  As
    to the English language issue there was evidence that the Appellant was
    "unofficially attending ESOL classes on an entry 1 level non accredited
    course".

 9. The judge dismissed the appeal and explained why in this way;

         "18. The Appellant has not passed an English language test with  an
             approved provider.  There is no cogent evidence, such as  from
             an education psychologist, that she lacks the  ability  to  do
             so.

         19.  The Appellant fails to meet the income requirement.  I do  not
             accept that it has been established that [ZT] is not going  to
             be able to earn sufficient to enable her to meet the  relevant
             income threshold in the absence of evidence stating that  from
             an eye surgeon.  There is no cogent evidence that once he  has
             had his operation to remove the  cataract  that  he  would  be
             unable to find sufficiently remunerative employment.

         20.  For both  of  these  reasons  the  application  was  correctly
             refused and could not have succeeded at this hearing.  This is
             not a case where evidential flexibility should be  applied  as
             the relevant documents simply do not exist.

         21.  Therefore the Respondent's decision is in accordance with  the
             law and the applicable Immigration Rules and  I  dismiss  that
             part of the appeal.

         22.   I  accept  that  the  decision  to  refuse  leave  to  remain
             interferes with the family's right to respect for their family
             life.  It is a decision that can cause consequences of gravity
             given  the  low  threshold   involved   and   their   enforced
             separation.  It would also be lawful given the failure to meet
             the Immigration Rules and for the legitimate aim of  requiring
             people to comply with those  Rules  and  not  be  an  economic
             burden on the state and  be  able  to  integrate  through  the
             ability to communicate.

         23.  The real issue is  whether  denying  the  Appellant  leave  to
             remain is a proportionate response  to  the  need  to  require
             people to comply with those Rules and policy considerations.

         24.  My primary consideration is what is in  [Y]'s  best  interest.
             It is not the only consideration  and  does  not  trump  other
             considerations.

         25.  It is in his best interest to be brought up by and  live  with
             the adults who have provided him with parental care since  his
             parents died in 2004 namely the  Appellant  and  her  husband.
             The family  has  only  comparatively  recently  been  reunited
             following  an  enforced  separation  of  many  years.   He  is
             entitled  to  be  here  as  his  application  is  outstanding.
             Removal of the Appellant, who has been his primary  carer  for
             eleven years, will inevitably be very upsetting.  He has  only
             been here for three years.  There is  no  cogent  evidence  he
             left Eritrea illegally or does not have family to  return  to.
             There is no cogent evidence he does  not  speak  the  language
             used in Eritrea or not understand the culture.   He  would  be
             with his mother figure if he  left  with  the  Appellant.   As
             things stand it would be his choice to do  so  as  he  has  an
             application outstanding.  [ZT] and [S] were able to travel  to
             Eritrea recently and had no  problems.   The  fact  that  they
             travelled on British passports does not  mean  that  he  would
             have any problems by not having one.  They could visit him  if
             he chose to go back with the Appellant  while  she  makes  her
             application.  In my judgment given these factors it  would  be
             reasonable to expect him to follow the Appellant to Eritrea.

         26.  It has not been  established  that  the  Appellant  lacks  the
             ability to pass the relevant English  language  test  for  the
             reasons I have already given.  I do not  accept  that  it  has
             been established that [ZT] is not going to  be  able  to  earn
             sufficient  to  enable  them  to  meet  the  relevant   income
             threshold for the reasons I have already given.

         27.  I accept that all the family here would be distressed  by  the
             separation.  They are entitled to support  from  the  NHS.   I
             accept  that  the  Appellant  would  be  distressed   by   the
             separation.  The length of the separation is entirely  in  the
             hands of the family.

         28.  There is no cogent evidence she would  have  any  problems  in
             Eritrea as there is no evidence she left illegally or  has  no
             family there.  [ZT] and [S] were able to travel there recently
             and had no problems.  The fact that they travelled on  British
             passports does not mean that she would have  any  problems  by
             not having one.  They could visit  her  while  she  makes  her
             application.

         29.  There is nothing unusual about this case let alone compelling.
              There will no (sic) 'unjustifiable hardship'.  There  are  no
             insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed  outside
             the United Kingdom as [ZT] has been  there  recently  and  can
             visit her during the process.  [S] is an  adult  who  did  not
             live with the Appellant for ten years and does not  live  with
             her now as she is in Leeds and he is in Sutton  Colefield  and
             he can also visit her while she applies.

         30.  Even if she had to return to Eritrea to apply and the rest  of
             the family stayed here, I am satisfied that she has failed  to
             establish that she does not have  family  with  whom  she  can
             stay.  She speaks the language and understands the culture and
             has lived there for far longer than she has lived here.

         31.  Given how she fails under  the  Rules  to  meet  the  relevant
             financial threshold and failed to  establish  her  ability  in
             English, and the  ease  with  which  that  can  be  addressed,
             requiring her to leave the United Kingdom is in my judgment  a
             proportionate response to the need to  maintain  the  economic
             wellbeing of the country to require her to establish that  she
             meets the Rules and re-apply when she can establish  that  she
             can do so".

10. Hence, the appeal failed.



The Permission Stage

11. The above was not the end of the matter because the Appellant, assisted
    by new representatives (her current ones)  applied  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  In the grounds it was pointed  out  that
    entry clearance had been granted under the "old Rules", that is to  say
    the Rules prior to the July 2012 amendments referred to above.  It  was
    pointed out that, on  the  judge's  findings,  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband had been parted for a period of ten years and that this was not
    by choice.  It was suggested, in effect, that the judge  had  erred  in
    his consideration as to what was in the best interests of [Y], that  he
    had erred in basing his conclusion "entirely on the  premise  that  the
    Appellant  can  return  to  Eritrea  and  make   an   entry   clearance
    application", and that he had failed to take account of the  fact  that
    she would not succeed under the Rules such that the separation would be
    for an open-ended period.  It was suggested that  he  should,  instead,
    have asked himself whether there were insurmountable obstacles  to  the
    whole family relocating to Eritrea.  As to that, it was  suggested,  in
    effect, there would be.

12. Permission was initially refused by a Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    but was eventually granted by a Judge of the  Upper  Tribunal  on  14th
    October 2015.  The grant reads as follows;

         "It is arguable  that,  in  Judge  Saffer's  consideration  of  the
         question whether it is reasonable to expect the Appellant to return
         to Eritrea and make an application for entry clearance, he may have
         overlooked the fact that, as explained in R (Chen)  v  SSHD  [2015]
         UKUT 00189 (IAC), the guidance in Chikwamba is of  relevance  where
         minor children are involved.  Given that the judge accepts that the
         Appellant and her husband have provided [Y] (who was 15  years  old
         at the date of the hearing before the  judge)  with  parental  care
         since the death of  his  own  parents,  it  is  arguable  that  the
         reasoning at  paragraphs  25-31  shows  that  the  judge  may  have
         misapprehended  Chen,  in  that,  he  makes  no  reference  to  the
         proportionality of separating a minor child from at  least  one  of
         two adults who is providing him with  parental  care,  although  he
         appears to acknowledge the likelihood of [Y] being  separated  from
         the Appellant given that he said that [Y] is entitled to remain  in
         the UK whilst his application is outstanding.

         The key issue in this case revolves around consideration of whether
         it is reasonable  to  expect  [Y]  to  forego  his  opportunity  of
         awaiting the outcome of his application for leave  and  follow  the
         Appellant to Eritrea as opposed to him  being  separated  from  the
         Appellant while she makes her  entry  clearance  application.   The
         other children are adults.

         The  judge's  finding  in  relation  to  the  income  threshold  at
         paragraph 19 does not make sense; there  may  be  an  unintentional
         double negative in the second sentence.  Nevertheless, it is  clear
         that the Appellant does not  satisfy  the  requirements  for  leave
         under the Immigration Rules on the judge's findings.   Accordingly,
         in order to succeed outside the Immigration  Rules,  the  Appellant
         will have to show compelling circumstances, if [Y]  is  treated  as
         her child, or exceptional circumstances if he is not: paragraphs 31-
         33 of Singh and Khalid v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74, judgment in which
         was delivered on 23rd April 2015  (after  the  hearing  before  the
         judge but before his determination was promulgated)".

13. It is clear that the Upper Tribunal Judge was  granting  permission  on
    the basis of the situation  surrounding  [Y]  but  the  grant  was  not
    specifically expressed to be limited, nobody argued that I should treat
    it as being limited and I have not, in those circumstances, done so.



The Hearing Before the Upper Tribunal

14. There was a hearing before the Upper Tribunal  (before  me)  to  decide
    whether the decision of the judge did involve the making of an error of
    law and, if so, what should follow from that.  It was  anticipated,  in
    directions, that if I did set the  decision  aside  in  consequence  of
    legal error, I would go on (if appropriate or necessary) to re-make the
    decision at the  same  hearing.   Attendance  at  the  hearing  was  as
    indicated above.

15. Ms Anderson said that she would maintain all the arguments relied  upon
    in the grounds of application for permission to appeal.  She  submitted
    that,  in  particular,  the  judge  had  erred  in  failing  to  attach
    sufficient importance to the best interests of the child ([Y]) and that
    such  was  a  "paramount"  consideration.   The  judge  had  failed  to
    adequately explain why it was thought appropriate to separate [Y]  from
    the Appellant.  It would appear that, contrary to what  the  judge  had
    found, the maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules were  met.
    The particular  Rules  applicable  to  this  Appellant,  as  the  judge
    appeared not to have appreciated, only required it to be shown that the
    family would have more by way of income available to it than  a  family
    in receipt of income support.  The  Respondent  had  appreciated  which
    Rules applied but had undertaken an  incorrect  calculation.   So,  had
    matters been properly considered, the judge would have appreciated that
    the Appellant only failed to meet the Rules in relation to the  English
    language test and, in any event, she  had  attempted  to  retrieve  her
    passport from the Home Office in order to take such a test but had  not
    been able to do so.

16. Mr Diwnycz, for the Respondent, said that he  did  not  object  to  the
    decision being set aside and that he would not oppose my so doing.   He
    also said that he agreed with Ms Anderson that the Rules applicable  to
    this Appellant, with respect to maintenance, did not exclude the taking
    into account of third party support.

17. In light of the arguments and Mr Diwnycz's  very  conciliatory  stance,
    bearing in mind his position as the representative of the Secretary  of
    State before me, I decided, for reasons which are set out below, to set
    aside the judge's decision on the grounds of legal error.  I then heard
    some limited oral  evidence  with  respect  to  the  re-making  of  the
    decision.

18. I heard evidence from  [S].   He  confirmed  his  relationship  to  the
    Appellant and told me that he earns �21,000 per annum after deductions.
     He provided some information regarding his income and  outgoings.   He
    said that he provides the rest  of  his  UK-based  family  with  money.
    Amounts vary but he is prepared to do that for as long as he  can.   He
    is single.

19. I then heard submissions as to how the decision should be re-made.   Mr
    Diwnycz, in addressing me, simply said that he would concede that there
    is family life between all of the UK-based family members.  He said  he
    did not intend to take matters any further than that.

20. Ms Anderson, for the Appellant, submitted that the evidence now  showed
    that the Appellant had only failed  to  meet  one  requirement  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  It would be disproportionate to  cause  any  family
    separation.  It was said that she would not be able to take an  English
    language test in Eritrea because of the lack of a suitable centre.  The
    parties had been apart for ten years.  The best interests of the  minor
    child had to be considered.  It was in [Y]'s best interest to  live  in
    the UK with both of his  parents  (though  they  are  not  his  natural
    parents).  If the Appellant returns  to  Eritrea  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance she will be separated from the rest  of  her  family  for  an
    indefinite period.  Further, any application for entry  clearance  will
    have to satisfy the current Immigration Rules which  are  significantly
    more demanding than they were when she made her initial application for
    entry clearance.



Did the First-tier Tribunal Err in Law?

21. It will be apparent from the above that Mr Diwnycz accepted or, at  the
    very least, came very close indeed to accepting that it did.   Further,
    and in any event, it does seem to me that, although the judge correctly
    indicated  that  the  best  interests  of  [Y]  would  be   a   primary
    consideration (not a paramount consideration as Ms Anderson submits) he
    did not, in his analysis of  the  various  possible  scenarios  if  the
    Appellant were to  return  to  Eritrea,  consider  the  impact  that  a
    separation from at least one parent would have upon him.  That  had  to
    be considered, it seems to me, even in circumstances where it might  be
    thought the Appellant would, in due course, be likely to succeed  in  a
    future entry clearance application.  Further, and in any event,  it  is
    apparent from what the Respondent said  in  the  "reasons  for  refusal
    letter" that Ms Anderson  is  correct  in  stating  that  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules in the  Appellant's  particular  circumstances,  that
    being paragraph 284(viii) of those Rules, only impose a requirement  to
    the effect that;

         "The parties will be able to maintain themselves and any dependants
         adequately without recourse to public funds".

22. Thus, the judge was wrong in thinking that the test was one of  whether
    it could be shown that the Appellant and her husband would be  able  to
    show earnings of �18,600 per annum plus additions for other dependants.
     The  judge  did  appear  to  think  that  those  were  the  applicable
    requirements because he appeared to accept uncritically (see  paragraph
    14 of the determination) an indication on the  part  of  the  Appellant
    that that was the test to be applied.  So, the judge concluded that the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements were  not  met  on  a  false
    premise.  He did not, as a consequence of his  erroneous  understanding
    that the Rules regarding a starting threshold of �18,600 with additions
    for dependants were not applicable on the facts of this  case,  enquire
    into the position or reach a finding, based on a proper  understanding,
    as to whether the maintenance requirements were met or not.  Of course,
    it would nevertheless have been the case that the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules were not met because of the  English  language  issue
    but the extent to which the Immigration Rules were  not  complied  with
    might have been a consideration in  an  assessment  of  the  Article  8
    arguments outside the Rules.

23. In light of all of the above, when taken  together,  I  set  aside  the
    judge's decision.



Re-making the Decision

24. Nobody suggested that I should remit to the  First-tier  Tribunal  and,
    indeed, Ms Anderson positively urged me to re-make the decision myself.
     Mr Diwnycz was content with that course of action.   That  is  what  I
    have done.

25. As to the position with respect to the Immigration Rules, there  is  no
    dispute  about  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  was  required  by  the
    applicable Rules to demonstrate that  she  had  passed  an  appropriate
    English language test and that she had,  in  fact,  not  done  so.   Ms
    Anderson makes the point that, since  the  decision  under  appeal  was
    made, efforts have been made, albeit unsuccessful ones, to retrieve the
    Appellant's passport from the Home Office (the  Home  Office  seemingly
    having taken the passport as a result of her application being refused)
    so that she  can  take  a  test.   To  my  mind,  though,  she  had  an
    opportunity to successfully pass a test prior to  her  application  for
    further leave being made.  She  failed  to  do  so.   It  is  right  to
    conclude, that the Immigration Rules, in this  regard  at  least,  have
    been shown not to be met.  Accordingly, she simply cannot succeed under
    the Rules and, if she is to succeed at all, that will have to be on the
    basis of Article 8 of the ECHR outside the Rules.

26. There is, of course, the maintenance issue to consider although even if
    I am to decide that the maintenance requirements are met that does  not
    avail her under the Rules because of the English  language  difficulty.
    Nevertheless, though, unlike Judge Saffer, I did have  the  opportunity
    of hearing some oral evidence regarding the maintenance issue  as  well
    as specific argument on the point.  I have highlighted  the  applicable
    Immigration Rule above and it was Ms Anderson's submission that because
    the applicable Rule was to be  found  at  paragraph  284(viii)  of  the
    Rules, third party support could, in principle,  be  relied  upon.   Mr
    Diwnycz indicated that that was accepted by him as  being  the  correct
    legal position so  it  was  not  necessary,  in  the  face  of  such  a
    concession, for me to enquire into the  matter  further.   Ms  Anderson
    also submitted that, on the facts of this case, and  on  the  basis  of
    reliance upon the third party support of  [S],  the  maintenance  Rules
    were, indeed, met.  [S]'s evidence was not the subject of any challenge
    before Mr Diwnycz and I accept, on that  evidence,  that  as  a  junior
    doctor he is in stable employment and that he is both willing and  able
    to contribute  to  maintenance  of  the  Appellant.   However,  as  was
    explained in AK and Others (Long-term third party  support)  Bangladesh
    [2006] UKAIT  00069,  whilst  the  evidence  needed  to  establish  the
    availability  of  short-term  third  party  support  may  be  satisfied
    comparatively readily, a long-term commitment to  third  party  funding
    requires more detailed and broader evidence and enquiry and it needs to
    be established that, in the long-term, whatever the third  party's  own
    future family and other commitments might be, he would be  willing  and
    able to give funding priority to supporting  an  Appellant.   Whilst  I
    accept the current willingness of [S] to  support  the  Appellant  and,
    indeed, other family members, he is currently single but, looking at  a
    long-term perspective, it  is  entirely  possible  that  matters  might
    change substantially if, for example, he were to commit  to  a  partner
    and have children.  On the material before me, therefore, whilst  I  am
    satisfied as to the short-term, I am not  sufficiently  satisfied  with
    respect  to  the  long-term  to  safely  conclude,  to  a  balance   of
    probabilities, that he will be both willing and able, in the future, to
    provide ongoing support.

27. Having considered and decided what the position is under  the  Rules  I
    have asked myself whether it is necessary to  go  on  to  consider  the
    applicability of Article 8 of the  ECHR  outside  the  Rules.   I  have
    considered that it is entirely appropriate to do  so  bearing  in  mind
    what I find to  be  unusual  circumstances  and  bearing  in  mind,  in
    particular, the previous history of enforced separation of husband  and
    wife and the particular position of  [Y].   In  considering  Article  8
    outside of the Rules I have reminded myself of the five stage test  set
    out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I have also reminded myself that  it  is
    necessary to look at Article 8 issues through the prism of the  current
    Immigration Rules, that it is necessary to consider the matters set out
    in Section 117A to 117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002 insofar  as  they  are  applicable  (certain  of  them  not  being
    applicable because this is not a  deportation  case)  and  that  if  an
    appeal is to succeed under Article 8 outside the Rules that  will  only
    be where there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised
    under the new Rules to require the grant of leave or the allowing of an
    appeal.

28. There is no dispute, here, that Article 8 is engaged.  Mr  Diwnycz  did
    not say very much at all in his closing submissions to me  but  he  did
    say that he accepted that there was family life,  effectively,  between
    each and every UK-based family member who has featured in the arguments
    concerned with this appeal.   Mr  Diwnycz  did  not  contend  that  the
    interference with Article 8 rights consequent upon the Appellant having
    to leave the UK would fall short of  the  necessary  gravity  which  is
    required to engage the Article.  Ms Anderson, for  her  part,  did  not
    contend that the interference would not be lawful or would  not  be  in
    pursuance of a  legitimate  aim.   The  question  then  comes  down  to
    proportionality bearing in mind the particular factors I have  set  out
    above.  My consideration, therefore, is not simply  a  freewheeling  or
    unfettered one but it is informed by the  content  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and the degree of specificity of the requirements  now  contained
    in the Rules.

29. The Appellant, I have already decided, does not  meet  certain  of  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Her  failure  to  do  so  is  a
    matter of considerable significance. The public interest question is  a
    most  important  consideration.   Having  regard  to   the   applicable
    provisions contained within Section 117A to D, I remind myself that the
    maintenance  of  effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the   public
    interest.  I remind myself that it  is  in  the  public  interest  that
    persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  UK  are  able  to  speak
    English.  I remind myself that it is similarly in the  public  interest
    that such  persons  are  financially  independent.   Those  are,  then,
    considerations which weigh against this Appellant because  she  is  not
    financially independent, being reliant upon family members and has  not
    demonstrated that she speaks English to the requisite standard.  Having
    said that, though, I also attach some importance to my finding that, as
    matters stand, financial support  is  available  from  [S].   I  attach
    weight to the fact that [ZT] receives benefits in his own  right  as  a
    British citizen such that the family as a whole is not receiving public
    funds simply on the basis of the Appellant's presence here.  As to  the
    English language position I note that evidence was previously given  to
    the effect that she is at least making some attempt  to  learn  English
    and such was not placed in issue before me.  So,  those  considerations
    ameliorate, to some extent, the  damaging  nature  of  the  Appellant's
    failure to show she is financially independent and an adequate  English
    speaker.

30. In looking at matters which might be thought to favour  the  Appellant,
    she has what I find to be and what  was  in  fact  accepted  to  be,  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with her husband who is  a  British
    citizen.  There is a particularly unusual aspect of this case  in  that
    the Appellant and her husband have already been separated for a  period
    of ten years in consequence of his fleeing Eritrea.  I accept that that
    is to be regarded as an enforced separation rather than  one  borne  of
    choice. Thus, in view of that  history,  further  separation  would  be
    particularly difficult to bear.  There is also  the  question  of  [Y].
    Whilst he is not a "qualifying child" for the purpose of the Rules,  he
    is a child and it would, I accept, be in his best interests  to  remain
    in the UK rather than to forego his own pending application for further
    leave and that it would be, similarly, in his best interests not to  be
    separated  from  either  parent.   I  accept  that  his   position   is
    effectively that of a child of the family.  His best interests are not,
    of themselves, decisive but are a factor  of  some  significance.   The
    Appellant has a number of family members in the UK, as outlined  above,
    and the cumulative impact of separation from all of  them  or  most  of
    them  if,  for  example,  [Y]  were  to  return  with  her,  would   be
    significant.  I accept that the Appellant would be able to  seek  entry
    clearance upon return but, even if in due course  such  an  application
    was successful which on the facts cannot  be  guaranteed,  there  would
    still be a difficult period of  uncertainty  and  separation  from  her
    husband and, quite possibly, from [Y]  whom  I  have  already  said  is
    effectively to be regarded as a child of the family.

31. In light of all of the above I have concluded, in my judgment, that the
    Appellant  has   established   that   there   are,   here,   compelling
    circumstances, as outlined above, (I accept compelling circumstances is
    the correct test) as to why her appeal  should  succeed  on  Article  8
    grounds outside the Immigration Rules.  Insofar as it  is  relevant  Mr
    Diwnycz did not seek to persuade me to the contrary but, in any  event,
    I would have reached the same conclusion.  Accordingly, therefore, this
    appeal succeeds on Article 8 grounds.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law.  Its decision is set aside.  I go onto re-make  the  decision.   In  so
doing I allow the appeal of the Appellant on Article 8 grounds.



Anonymity

I make no anonymity direction.  None was sought.
