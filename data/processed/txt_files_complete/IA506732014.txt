                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION Not Made)


                                                                 Respondent:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss I Hussain, Counsel instructed by Ravi Dilan &
Hayer    Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In this determination the Appellant is referred to as the Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.
2.   The Claimant, a national of Albania ,date of birth 10  September  1986,
    appealed against  the   Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  refuse  a
    residence card with reference to Regulation  8(5)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations)  on  4
    December 2014
3.   The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Thomas (the judge) who on 28 April 2015 found  that  the  Claimant  had
    discharged the burden of proof upon a balance of probabilities that  he
    and his partner  were  in  a  durable  relationship  and  therefore  an
    extended  family  member  for  the  purposes  of  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 8(5) of the 2006 Regulations.  The judge went  on  to  allow
    the appeal under the EEA Regulations.
4.   The Secretary of State appealed against that decision.
5.   The Secretary of State's principal ground was that the judge had  erred
    in law because, having found the Claimant and the EEA Sponsor were in a
    durable relationship, under Regulation 17 of the 2006 Regulations .This
    was a matter which had not been considered by the Secretary  of  State.
    In the light of the case law of Ihemedu (OFMs - meaning) Nigeria [2011]
    UKUT 00340, Ukus [2012] UKUT 307 and Boodhoo [2013] UKUT 346 the matter
    should have been returned to the Secretary of State to make a  decision
    in accordance with the law.
6.   On 23 June 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge I Murray gave  permission  to
    appeal.
7.   At the hearing today it was conceded on behalf  of  the  Claimant  that
    the appropriate course, in the light of the judge's  finding,  was  for
    the matter to be returned to the Secretary of State to  await  decision
    in accordance with the law.
         NOTICE OF DECISION The Original Tribunal's  decision  cannot  stand
    and the matter will be sent back to the Secretary of State to  consider
    this matter,  on  the  basis  of  the  judge's  findings  of  fact,  in
    accordance with the law.
         No anonymity direction is made.

Signed                                  Date 26 February 2016


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey
