                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Miller of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 6th February 2018.

 2. The Appellant is a female Sri Lankan citizen born in  July  1986.   The
    Appellant claimed asylum on 2nd  January  2015.   The  application  was
    refused on 22nd November 2017 and the Appellant appealed to the FTT.

 3. The FTT refused an application for an adjournment  at  the  hearing  on
    17th  January  2018.   Counsel  for  the  Appellant  had  requested  an
    adjournment to obtain a psychologist's report.   Following  refusal  of
    the adjournment request the FTT heard evidence from the Appellant and a
    witness.  The FTT agreed that the Appellant  should  be  treated  as  a
    vulnerable witness.  The FTT did not find that the Appellant had  given
    a credible account.  Reasons for this finding were given by the FTT  at
    paragraph 37(i)-(ix).

 4. The Appellant was found not to be credible, the FTT did not  find  that
    she would be at risk if returned to Sri Lanka, and therefore  concluded
    that she was not entitled to asylum or humanitarian protection, and her
    removal from the UK would not breach  Articles  2  or  3  of  the  1950
    European Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 5. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    relying upon six grounds which are summarised below;

    Ground 1

    The FTT failed to apply country guidance and failed to make any or  any
    sufficient  findings  in  relation  to  country  guidance  and  country
    information.  It was submitted that the FTT had  made  no  findings  in
    relation to GJ Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319, MM  (Sri  Lanka)  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 36, and PP (Sri Lanka) [2017] UKUT 117.

    The Respondent had accepted that the Appellant had been an  active  LTT
    member, and the FTT did not make a finding as to  whether  or  not  the
    Appellant would as a result be perceived by the Sri Lankan  authorities
    as posing a threat to the unity of Sri Lanka.  No finding was  made  as
    to whether and to what extent that risk  would  be  compounded  by  her
    diaspora activities which included giving evidence to the ICPPG and her
    involvement with the TGTE.

    The FTT made no findings as to whether or not the Appellant would be at
    risk as a single Tamil female returning to a  previous  conflict  area,
    and the impact of her significant mental vulnerability  which  elevates
    risks significantly according to PP (Sri Lanka).

    Ground 2

    The FTT erred by making no findings in relation to Article  3  and  the
    risk of suicide.

    The FTT was referred to J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ  629  and  invited  to
    find there was a real risk the Appellant  would  commit  suicide  as  a
    result of return to Sri Lanka but no findings were made.

    Ground 3

    The FTT failed to have regard to relevant factors  and  had  regard  to
    irrelevant factors.  The FTT did not consider MM Sri Lanka when finding
    it incredible that the Appellant had been able to pass through security
    at Colombo Airport and made no attempt to conceal her identity.

    The FTT erred in expecting evidence to be produced from the people with
    whom the Appellant was living in relation to her  suicide  attempt,  if
    this was as a result of her treatment in Sri  Lanka.   The  Appellant's
    evidence was that she did not want to tell those she  was  living  with
    about being raped.

    It was submitted that the FTT had erred  by  finding  there  was  "very
    little" in the way of medical evidence in relation  to  the  Appellant.
    It  was  contended  that  there  were  documents  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's discharge from hospital  following  a  suicide  attempt,  a
    scarring report, a letter confirming a diagnosis of depressive disorder
    with PTSD symptoms, a letter from the Appellant's psychotherapist,  and
    a letter from  the  Appellant's  GP  dated  28th  November  2016  which
    referred to the Appellant expressing definite plans to end her life  if
    sent back to Sri Lanka.  The FTT did not refer to the report  in  which
    the Appellant's scars were found to be consistent with  her  claims  to
    have been tortured, and made no reference to  the  Appellant's  suicide
    risk.

    The FTT found at  paragraph  37(viii)  that  the  Appellant  had  first
    studied and then applied for an EEA residence card "without  mentioning
    asylum to anybody".  It was contended that this was incorrect,  as  the
    Appellant had given evidence in her asylum interview that she had asked
    a solicitor about claiming asylum but was told  that  this  would  cost
    ï¿½5,000 which she could not afford.  It was contended that the FTT erred
    in considering the letter from the ICPPG at page 1 of  the  Appellant's
    bundle, in  that  the  Appellant  had  not  merely  consented  to  give
    evidence, but had provided written evidence.

    Ground 4

    It was submitted that the FTT erred by misapplying  section  8  of  the
    Asylum and Immigration (Treatment  of  Claimants,  etc.)  Act  2004  by
    failing to assess the impact of the Appellant's vulnerability upon  the
    promptness or otherwise of her asylum claim.  The  FTT  had  failed  to
    recognise  that  claiming  asylum  was  a  last  resort  in  that   the
    Appellant's evidence was that she had  other  routes  open  to  her  to
    remain in the UK which she attempted to use, albeit unsuccessfully.

    Ground 5

    The FTT erred by accepting that the Appellant was a vulnerable  witness
    but failed  to  treat  her  as  a  vulnerable  witness  when  assessing
    credibility.  It was contended that the FTT had failed  to  follow  the
    principles in AM (Afghanistan) [2017] EWCA Civ 1123.  It was  contended
    that the FTT had erred by failing to give consideration as to  how  the
    Appellant's vulnerability might have affected her account.







    Ground 6

    The FTT erred by failing to grant an adjournment which meant  that  the
    Appellant did not have a fair  hearing.   It  was  submitted  that  the
    evidence indicated that the Appellant had clear mental  health  issues,
    but there was no up-to-date expert report and this was  required.   The
    FTT commented at paragraph 37(vi) that little had been submitted by way
    of medical evidence, but had refused an  adjournment  to  acquire  this
    evidence.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Parkes and I set out below in
    part the grant of permission;

         2.   The judge refused to adjourn the case on an  application  made
             at the hearing.  It was  found  that  the  Appellant  was  not
             credible with regards to her claim about events in  Sri  Lanka
             for the reasons given in paragraph 37 of the decision.

         3.   The grounds  argue  that  the  judge  did  not  apply  country
             guidance and did not make relevant findings.   The  judge  did
             not make findings on Article 3  and  the  Appellant's  suicide
             risk.  With regard to the Appellant's departure from Sri Lanka
             the judge had not had regard to the evidence of corruption  at
             the airport.  There  was  medical  evidence  relating  to  the
             Appellant's condition and suicide attempts and  there  was  no
             reference to the scarring report.  The Appellant had not  been
             treated as vulnerable and should have  adjourned  the  hearing
             for a psychiatric report.

         4.   The final point has no merit, with the history of the case set
             out by the judge there had  been  ample  opportunity  for  the
             report to be obtained or for an application to be  made  ahead
             of  the  hearing.   Fairness  is  obtained  by  providing  the
             opportunity to take the required action, if an Appellant  does
             not take the  opportunity  that  does  not  make  the  hearing
             unfair.  That said the point is not important in  the  context
             of this appeal as there is merit in the failure of  the  judge
             to deal adequately or at all with the  medical  evidence  that
             was available and to assess the future risk to the  Appellant.



         5.   The grounds are arguable and permission to appeal is  granted.



 7. Following the grant of permission, the Respondent submitted a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008.  It is a  brief  response  contending  that  the  judge  directed
    himself appropriately and made findings open to him on the basis of the
    evidence before him and gave adequate reasons.

 8. Directions were issued making provision  for  there  to  be  a  hearing
    before the  Upper  Tribunal  to  ascertain  whether  the  FTT  decision
    contained an error of law such that it should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 9. Ms Jaquiss relied upon the grounds contained within the application for
    permission to appeal and expanded upon them.

10. Mr Kotas conceded that the grounds disclosed a material error  of  law,
    and conceded that the FTT decision should be set aside with no findings
    preserved.

11. Both  representatives  submitted  that  in  the  circumstances  it  was
    appropriate to remit the appeal back to the FTT to be heard afresh.

My Conclusions and Reasons

12. I find the FTT materially erred in law for the  reasons  given  in  the
    grounds contained within the application for permission to appeal, read
    together with the grant of permission.  In my view the concession  made
    by Mr Kotas is rightly made.

13. The decision needs to be re-made.  No findings of fact  are  preserved.
    I have taken into account  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statements, and find it is appropriate to  remit  this  appeal
    back to the  FTT  because  there  is  substantial  fact-finding  to  be
    undertaken.  It is more appropriate for such  substantial  fact-finding
    to be undertaken by the FTT rather than the Upper Tribunal.

14. The appeal will therefore need to be decided afresh by  the  FTT.   The
    parties will be advised of the time and date  of  the  hearing  in  due
    course.  The appeal is to be heard by an FTT  judge  other  than  Judge
    Miller.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT involved the making of an error of law such that  it
is set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that it  is  remitted  to
the FTT with no findings of fact preserved.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

No fee award is made by the Upper Tribunal.  The  issue  of  any  fee  award
will need to be considered by the FTT.
