For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Seehra, instructed by Bhogal Partners,
Solicitors,       Hounslow, Middlesex.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Singh is a citizen of India whose date of birth is  recorded  as  20
    May 1939.  On or about 6 July 2012 he made application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of  long  residence.
    On 29 August 2013 a decision was made to refuse the application. On  30
    September 2013 he  lodged  a  Notice  of  Appeal  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. His appeal was heard on 6 August 2014 by Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Rothwell sitting at Hatton  Cross.   In  a  determination
    promulgated on 27 August 2014 Judge Rothwell dismissed the appeal under
    the Immigration Rules having regard to Paragraph 276B but  allowed  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.

 2. Not content with that determination by notice dated  1  September  2014
    the Secretary of State made application for permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal.

 3. In allowing the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal, Judge  Rothwell  had
    regard to Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of HC395  (as  amended)  but
    found that Mr Singh did not meet the requirements.   It  was  also  the
    case that Mr Singh could not benefit from the 14  year  long  residence
    rule because as at the date of decision he had only been in the  United
    Kingdom for 13ï¿½ years. Judge Rothwell did not find that Mr Singh had  a
    protected family life but found the private life so significant that it
    would be disproportionate in his judgment for Mr Singh to  be  removed.
    By the date of appeal Mr Singh had been in the United Kingdom for  over
    14 years.  He had always lived at the  Gurdwara  providing  daily  help
    there.  Additionally  Mr  Singh  had  formed  friendships  amongst  the
    community.  Judge Rothwell, contrary to what was later to  be  asserted
    in the grounds, had regard to the provisions of  Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  That Mr  Singh  did  not
    speak English was a matter which Judge Rothwell did  not  feel  weighed
    heavy in the circumstances in which he was living at the  Gurdwara  and
    although there was some access to the NHS for tablets for his diabetes,
    again weighing that against the public interest and recognising that Mr
    Singh had devoted his life to his faith,  teaching  and  being  a  full
    participant within the local Sikh community, with no recourse to public
    funds and accommodation met by the community, Judge Rothwell  found  in
    Mr Singh's favour.

 4. The grounds were as follows:-

         "The First-tier Tribunal Judge had made a material error of law  in
         allowing the Appellant's appeal.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         finds that the Appellant cannot satisfy the Immigration Rules,  but
         allows it owing to the Appellant's private life.

         Making a Material Misdirection of Law -  Proportionality  -  Public
Interest

          a) The First-tier Tribunal Judge concludes  that  the  Appellant's
             age,  charitable works and length of residence means  that  his
             removal from the United Kingdom is a disproportionate breach of
             his rights under Article 8 with reference to his  private  life
             ties (paragraphs 32 and 33).

          b) The Secretary of State respectively submits that the First-tier
             Tribunal Judge, in  assessing  the  individual  rights  of  the
             Appellant, has failed to consider the wider public interest and
             all of the factors detailed in Section 117B and with regard  to
             relevant juris prudence.

          c) Section 117B sets of several factors that  are  in  the  public
             interest.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge engages  with  117B(2)
             and 177B(3), namely English language and maintenance but not on
             those factors outlined at 117(1) and 117(5), namely;  that  the
             maintenance of an  effective  immigration  control  is  in  the
             public interest and that little weight should be afforded to  a
             private life that is formed by a person who is  unlawfully,  or
             precariously, present in the United Kingdom.   In  the  instant
             appeal the Appellant arrived in 2000 as a visitor, i.e.:  in  a
             temporary capacity and he  overstayed  (thereby  rendering  his
             presence unlawful).

          d) The First-tier Tribunal Judge fails to indicate what weight has
             been given to the Appellant's circumstances,  however;  on  the
             fair reading of the determination  it  would  seem  significant
             weight (i.e.: enough to outweigh  the  strong  public  interest
             factors) has been afforded to it.  This is incorrect in law  as
             Section 117B(5) plainly states.  This is material to the First-
             tier Tribunal Judge's decision to  allow  the  appeal  and  the
             conclusion that the public interest is outweighed by a  private
             life that could, in all essential  elements,  be  continued  in
             India.

          e) In Nasim and Others  (Article  8)  [2014]  UK  UT25  the  Upper
             Tribunal were of the view that, in  keeping  with  the  Supreme
             Court judgment in Patel and others v Secretary of State for the
             Home Department [2013] UK SC72, those rights  under  Article  8
             which do not seek to protect an individuals moral and  physical
             integrity  would  be  of  limited  utility  in  the  overriding
             proportionality assessment.   Furthermore,  the  Tribunal  held
             that a person's human rights  would  not  be  enhanced  by  not
             relying on public funds.

          f)  In  the  instant  appeal   the   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge
             acknowledges that the Appellant has, and continues, to rely  on
             public funds in the form of NHS support (albeit the  extent  of
             the Appellant's reliance on the NHS is down played)  [Paragraph
             31/33].  The Secretary of State for the Home Department submits
             that, plainly, such reliance on public funds is material to the
             proportionality assessment and enhances the basic importance of
             maintaining a firm and  coherent  (i.e.  effective)  system  of
             immigration control that is realised by removal.

          g) The Secretary of State for the Home Department submits, for the
             reasons set out above, that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
             Tribunal to allow the instant appeal is materially  misdirected
             in law.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge has failed  to  consider
             the   weight   to    be    afforded    to    the    Appellant's
             precarious/unlawfully accrued private life and,  as  a  result,
             the proportionality assessment is fundamentally flawed."

 5. On or about 21 October 2014 Judge Brunnen granted permission to  appeal
    thus the matter came before me.

 6. I reminded Mr Walker, at the outset of the guidance given in  the  case
    of Budhathoki (Reasons for Decisions) [2014] UK UT 00341 (IAC) in which
    Haddon-Cave J had said:

         "It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-Tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case.  This
         leads to judgments becoming overly long and confused and is  not  a
         proportionate  approach  to  deciding  cases.   It   is,   however,
         necessary for judges to identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the
         evidence and explain in clear and brief terms their reasons so that
         the parties can understand why they have won or lost."

 7. Mr Walker very helpfully and quite properly in my  judgment  opened  by
    conceding that grounds a-e were misconceived.  In  those  circumstances
    whilst he was not abandoning the appeal, they were not pursued.  As  to
    the NHS support, Mr Walker pointed out that there was a letter on  file
    showing that the National Health Service had taken over  care  for  the
    Appellant as long ago as 2001.  Mr Walker told me that he had  reviewed
    the entirety of  the  file  and  that  it  was  clear  that  there  was
    considerable evidence before the judge which entitled him  to  come  to
    the view that he did whereas whomsoever drafted the grounds  would  not
    have had that  advantage.   In  the  circumstances  Mr  Walker  without
    abandoning the appeal made no submissions.

 8. It was not necessary for me to call on Ms Seehra.  I had from  her  the
    skeleton argument which had been relied upon in the First-tier Tribunal
    which  in  large  measure  is  rehearsed  from  paragraph  27  of   the
    determination of Judge Rothwell.

 9. I come to the view that the  grant  of  permission  in  this  case  was
    generous.  There is in my judgment nothing perverse  or  irrational  in
    the findings that were made by Judge Rothwell.  They were findings that
    were in my judgment open to him.  He was entitled, as he did,  to  take
    as his starting point the Immigration Rules and then have regard to the
    wider application  of  Article  8  ECHR  if  appropriate.   There  were
    sufficient reasons for a consideration of this appeal  outside  of  the
    Immigration Rules given the age of Mr Singh and the works which he  was
    doing in the community in which he resides.  Though Mr  Singh  had  not
    been in the United Kingdom for 14 years as then required or 20 years as
    would now be the case, still the number of years in the United Kingdom,
    coupled with the private life which Mr Singh in the  circumstances  was
    enjoying it, entitled the judge to come to the view which he  did.   In
    other words the findings were open  to  the  judge.   It  may  be  that
    another judge would have determined the case differently but that it is
    not the issue.  The question is whether it was open to  this  judge  on
    the evidence that was before him to come to the view that he  did.   In
    the absence of any persuasive argument from Mr Walker who  clearly  and
    quite properly was unable to advance any argument, I have no hesitation
    whatsoever in dismissing the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.  For the avoidance of doubt  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
