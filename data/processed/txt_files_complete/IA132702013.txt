                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge  Sarsfield
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 15th August 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 19th January  1991.   He
    came to the UK on 20th April 2011 on  a  student  visa  valid  to  10th
    August 2012.  On 4th August 2012 he applied for leave to  remain  as  a
    spouse, having married his wife on 21st May 2012.

 3. It was accepted that the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules.  His wife is employed  earning  �15,480  per
    annum and has �20,000 in savings.  The Appellant, as a student, is only
    able to work for ten hours a week and he earns �2,575 per annum.   Even
    if his earnings were able to be taken into account, they fall short  of
    the financial threshold by �545.

 4. The Judge stated that he could not  be  satisfied  that  the  Appellant
    would not be able  to  meet  any  financial  criteria  should  a  fresh
    application have to be made; there was insufficient  evidence  to  show
    that a fresh application would  not  succeed.   If  the  Appellant  had
    return, any separation would be for a limited period.

 5. He wrote as follows:

         "Under Article 8 the Appellant's wife must have been aware that the
         Appellant might have to leave  the  UK.   She  admits  knowing  his
         status before  marriage  so  she  entered  a  relationship  knowing
         exactly what the situation was.  She must have been aware that  she
         might have to make changes in her life in order to  continue  their
         relationship even temporarily.  Konstantinov v  Netherlands  [2007]
         said that where  family  life  was  created  at  a  time  when  the
         immigration status of one party was precarious from the outset then
         it is likely to be only in the most exceptional circumstances  that
         removal will violate Article 8.   I  do  not  consider  that  these
         circumstances are exceptional.

         I conclude that a fair balance between the interests of the  public
         and those of the Appellant and his wife would be  met  by  removing
         the Appellant from the UK and it is proportionate to do so.  He can
         return and apply to re-enter and has a home to  stay  in  Pakistan.
         Applications there are  dealt  with  expeditiously  and  separation
         would be for a limited period only.  The evidence does not  suggest
         it would be unsuccessful.   I  conclude  that  there  would  be  no
         prejudice that would amount to a breach of Article 8 if the  appeal
         was refused."

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that  at  the
    time that the couple married in May 2012, they only had  to  show  that
    they could be accommodated and maintained in the UK without  additional
    recourse to public funds.  The Judge's statement that the  Sponsor  was
    aware that she might have to move to another country is  not  based  on
    the facts and the evidence available.  The Judge failed  to  take  into
    account the fact that the Sponsor has lived in the UK since her  birth,
    all her family are here and she has never been to Pakistan  other  than
    as a visitor.  The Appellant is of good character, has fully integrated
    into the host community, and no reasons have been  given  for  ignoring
    the impact of his removal on his wife, a British citizen.

 7. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge  Robinson  on  10th
    September 2013.

 8. Upon renewal permission was granted by Judge Latter who  said  that  in
    the light of the judgment in MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) that a  number
    of relevant matters might not have been taken into account in assessing
    proportionality.

 9. On 5th November 2013 the Respondent served  a  reply.   The  Respondent
    submitted that she considers that the income threshold must remain at a
    level of �18,600  which  reflects  her  legitimate  aim  of  preventing
    burdens on the taxpayer in the long term and promoting good integration
    outcomes.  The  current  level  was  informed  by  the  advice  of  the
    Independent Migratory Advisory Committee as to the  level  at  which  a
    couple once settled, and taking  account  of  any  dependent  children,
    cannot generally access income related benefits.  This is a  matter  of
    public policy for the  government  and  Parliament  to  determine.  The
    Respondent invites the Tribunal to consider the application  as  a  two
    stage process, firstly  under  the  Rules  and  then  separately  under
    Article 8 case law.  She accepts that  the  factors  identified  in  MM
    should form part of the  proportionality  balancing  exercise  and  the
    impact of those other factors should also be weighed in the balance.

Submissions

10. Mr Diwnycz relied on his grounds and submitted that since the Appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules the appeal had to fail.

11. Mr Janjua submitted that MM remained good law and it would  be  unfair,
    harsh and unreasonable to expect the Appellant to  have  to  return  to
    Pakistan.

Findings and Conclusions

12. Mr Justice Blake declined to  grant  the  applicant  in  MM  relief  by
    quashing the Rules and concluded that it was not appropriate to  strike
    down the requirements of the Rules under challenge.

13. However in his summary of conclusions he wrote as follows:

         "In summary I accept that  there  is  a  legitimate  aim  that  the
         families of migrants should be encouraged by the terms of admission
         to integrate, not live at or near the subsistence level and not  be
         perceived to be a long term drain on the public purse in  the  form
         of increased access to state benefits.   A  subordinate  aspect  of
         such an aim is transparency  and  clarity  although  administrative
         convenience cannot be an end in itself or justify the separation of
         spouses.  However the  combination  of  features  identified  above
         amount together to a disproportionate interference with the  rights
         of British citizen Sponsors  and  refugees  to  enjoy  respect  for
         family life.  In terms of  the  Strasbourg  approach  they  do  not
         represent a fair balance between the competing interests  and  fall
         outside  the  margin  of  appreciation  or  discretionary  area  of
         judgment  available   in   policy   making   in   the   sphere   of
         administration.  I accept that a wider margin  of  appreciation  is
         likely to  be  relevant  to  foreign  Sponsors  who  are  voluntary
         migrants but not British citizens or refugees...

         Nevertheless the rights are of such fundamental importance and  the
         effect of the five aspects on which I have focused attention are so
         intrusive that I conclude that taken together they are more than is
         necessary to promote the legitimate aim.   The  substance  of  this
         claim is both the human rights of the  Sponsor  claimant  to  enjoy
         respectful family life and the constitutional right of the  British
         citizen to reside in the country  of  nationality  without  let  or
         hindrance.   From  this  perspective   the   application   of   the
         combination of the five factors to people in the position of  these
         claimants is not merely  disproportionate  as  a  matter  of  human
         rights law but also an irrational and  unjustified  restriction  on
         rights under the  law  relating  to  recognised  refugees  and  the
         constitutional rights of British citizens.

         I do not accept the claimant's case that the Secretary of State was
         required to adhere to the Rule 281(v) formula in all cases of entry
         clearance application by spouses of British citizens and recognised
         refugees.  She was justified in concluding that  greater  resources
         than �5,500 per annum for a couple without  children  and  adequate
         accommodation  were  needed  in  pursuit  of  the  aims   she   has
         identified.  It may be that  the  �18,600  minimum  income  without
         recourse to other sources of funding would be within the limits  of
         the Secretary of State's margin  of  appreciation  in  setting  the
         terms in which foreign Sponsors can  bring  in  their  spouses  and
         partners, even though this represents a radical departure from  the
         norm in the European Union based on the family reunion directive.

         However I conclude  that  this  measure  is  disproportionate  when
         applied to British citizens and recognised refugees.  In particular
         it is more intrusive in its restrictions on family life  to  ensure
         that couples are self-sufficient at the times of the spouse's first
         admission and are above the level of recourse to  public  funds  at
         the end of the five year period when the  party's  application  for
         settlement is being considered.

         There are a variety of less intrusive  responses  available.   They
         include:

         (i)  reducing the minimum income required of the Sponsor  alone  to
             �13,500; or thereabouts;

         (ii) permitting any savings over the �1,000 that may  be  spent  on
             processing the application itself to be used to supplement the
             income figure;

         (iii)    permitting account to be taken of the earning capacity  of
             the  spouse  after  entry  or  the  satisfactorily   supported
             maintenance undertakings of third parties;

         (iv) reducing to twelve  months  the  period  for  which  the  pre-
             estimate of financial viability is assessed.

         It is neither necessary nor desirable in these applications  to  go
         further than this judgment does in  identifying  what  might  be  a
         proportionate financial requirement.  It will be for the  Secretary
         of State if she sees fit to make such adjustments to the  rules  as
         will meet the observations in this judgment.   My  conclusions,  if
         they prove durable, are equally designed to assist  people  in  the
         position of the claimants and their families as to whether there is
         a reasonable prospect of  success  in  making  an  entry  clearance
         application, and judges of the First-tier and Upper  Tribunals  who
         will have the  difficult  task  of  determining  on  the  basis  of
         particular facts as found  or  are  undisputed  whether  Article  8
         requires the admission of the particular person.  By contrast  with
         decisions on deportation or decisions affecting children where  the
         principles are now  established  and  clear,  the  problems  facing
         Judges on appeal to decide on  human  rights  in  individual  cases
         without some  assessment  by  the  higher  courts  of  whether  the
         essential  package  is  a  legitimate  starting  point   would   be
         formidable."

14. The Sponsor earns �15,480  per  annum,  above  the  figure  of  �13,500
    suggested by Blake J, is British, has never lived in Pakistan  and  has
    �20,000 in savings.  The Appellant himself has shown that  he  has  the
    capacity to earn by working  for  his  permitted  hours  whilst  he  is
    studying. Furthermore there is no evidence of any abuse so far  as  the
    Immigration Rules are concerned.

15. However, the refusal was not just on the basis of an inability to  meet
    the financial requirements of the Rules. According to the  reasons  for
    refusal letter the Sponsor had not provided evidence  of  her  earnings
    from  her  employment  with  the  Cooperative  Group  other  than  bank
    statements showing payments made on a monthly basis.  So far as his own
    income was concerned, the Appellant had not provided any evidence other
    than a letter to show that he received wages or salary as an employee.

16. Furthermore, the Respondent stated that, in reliance  on  paragraph  E-
    LTRP.4.1, the Appellant had not provided any evidence to show  that  he
    had an academic qualification which met the relevant  requirements  and
    had not provided evidence to show that  he  had  passed  an  acceptable
    English language test approved by UKBA for this purpose.   He  was  not
    exempt from the test because he is not a national of a majority English
    speaking country.

17. There is a letter in the Appellant's bundle from Trinity College London
    recording that he has a Grade 2 in spoken  English  but  no  indication
    that Trinity College is a recognised provider and no reference  to  his
    passing other relevant examinations.  In any event, it is eleven months
    postdecision.

18. Since MM only offers the Appellant potential relief in relation to  the
    level of earnings required to satisfy the maintenance  requirements  of
    the Rules, and is silent in respect of the evidential requirements  and
    the  English  language  requirements,  it  is  not  authority  for  the
    proposition   that   the   removal   of   this   Appellant   would   be
    disproportionate.

19.  No  arguments  have  been  put  forward  to  show  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable for the couple to live in Pakistan  other  than  the  fact
    that the Sponsor's family are here. No practical issues relating to the
    possibilities of relocation raised, and no non standard features relied
    on to show that removal would be unjustifiably harsh - Gulshan (Article
    8 - new Rules - correct approach)[2013] UKUT 00640. The  Appellant  can
    make his application for entry clearance from there, ensuring  that  he
    meets the relevant requirements of the Rules.

20. There is no indication in this determination  that  the  Judge  engaged
    with MM, to which he did not refer.  However, had he done so  it  would
    have made no material difference to his decision.

Decision

21. The original Judge did not err  in  law.   The  Appellant's  appeal  is
    dismissed.
