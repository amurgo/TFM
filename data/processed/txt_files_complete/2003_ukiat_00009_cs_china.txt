                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr C Buckley for the Secretary of State
Mr A Yuen (working under the supervision of 'Phoenix Nova', solicitors)  for
the claimant

   This is an appeal from a decision of an  adjudicator  (Miss  DA  Thomas),
   sitting at Nottingham on 8 February 2002, allowing an  asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a citizen of China. Leave was given on  the  basis  that
   the adjudicator might have misunderstood the decision of the Tribunal  in
   Bin & Bang [01/BH/0059], which had been before her. The hearing was  held
   over, first to await the further decision of the Tribunal in  Liu  [2002]
   UKIAT 03683 (as Mr Yuen, who appeared in that case,  told  us  it  should
   properly be called; then by some administrative oversight, for  which  we
   are sorry.

2. It seemed to us that Liu had resolved the adjudicator's  misunderstanding
   of Bin & Bang, and much else besides, so we shall start with the  history
   of this litigation, in each case involving Mr Yuen,  under  the  �gis  of
   various firms, on behalf of Chinese illegal entrants who resisted removal
   on the basis of the risk on return from "snakeheads" who  arranged  their
   travel here, and from "loansharks"  who  financed  it.  In  Bin  &  Bang,
   written by Allen VP, the Tribunal allowed  Home  Office  appeals  against
   decisions of adjudicators, allowing on human rights  grounds  appeals  by
   two such persons. Their conclusion, at � 43, was this:

   ... we do not consider that either [claimant] has made out his  case  ...
   that he is at risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 on return to China.
   ... the weight of  the  objective  evidence  is  very  much  against  the
   argument that they raised, and we do not consider that that  evidence  is
   in any sense outweighed by the wealth of evidence concerning the practice
   of loansharks and snakeheads towards people  whose  contracts  with  them
   have succeeded and who have failed to repay them.

3. The reference to contracts succeeding was to  what  on  "country  expert"
   evidence the Tribunal found the manifest object of the whole  enterprise,
   which was to get the persons trafficked into Western countries where they
   would earn enough to pay off  the  debts  they  or  their  relations  had
   incurred to send them there. That is the economic motor behind  cases  of
   this kind.

4. Mr Yuen persuaded the adjudicator in the  present  case  to  a  different
   conclusion from that in Bin & Bang on the basis that the  Tribunal  there
   had drawn  a  distinction  between  "safe"  and  "unsafe"  arrivals.  She
   explained those at � 22: an unsafe arrival, she said, is where someone is
   apprehended on entry, and returned without ever getting to work  here  at
   all. This claimant, on the other hand, had arrived undetected (he says on
   18 May 1999), claimed asylum on  the  20th,  and  been  "granted  a  work
   permit" [she meant permission to work as an  asylum-seeker]  in  November
   that year, since when he had been in work here for some two years.

5. The adjudicator did not cite  the  actual  decision  in  Bin  &  Bang  in
   drawing that distinction; nor have we been able to find any  sign  of  it
   for ourselves. The point was raised in Liu (in which one of us took part,
   but which was written by Moulden VP), and dealt with (at  �  17)  on  the
   basis that there had been no concession by the Home Office in Bin &  Bang
   (referred to in Liu as 'Hou and Wu') that there was any  risk  on  return
   for safe arrivals here; nor, clearly, was there  anything  else  in  that
   decision to support the contention. What it appears to refer  to  is  the
   distinction drawn by counsel for the Home Office (see � 30) "...  between
   the behaviour of the snakeheads towards those  whose  emigration  to  the
   United Kingdom they have secured, and who have failed to repay them  ..."
   and others. What is meant, as should have been clear from  Liu,  is  that
   those who get to stay here, but fail to pay, may well  be  at  risk;  but
   others not. People currently working in this country obviously have means
   to pay, which is most unlikely to be the  case  with  those  returned  to
   China.

6. The ratio in Liu was as follows:

   15. The principal reason for our conclusion that the Appellant would  not
   be at risk on return is the lack of any country information  to  indicate
   that she would  be  at  risk.  Nevertheless,  logic  also  supports  this
   conclusion. The snakeheads and loan sharks are violent and  unscrupulous,
   but they are running what is likely to be a  highly  profitable  business
   and would prefer to avoid  actions  which  might  damage  that  business.
   Violent or other persecutory action against those  who  are  returned  to
   China would be unlikely to result in the  recovery  of  much  money,  but
   would be likely to discourage future customers. Amongst the press reports
   submitted by Mr Yuen are reports of snakeheads going to great lengths  to
   build spectacular houses to show to potential customers, as an indication
   of the sort of accommodation and lifestyle they can expect if they travel
   to a western country. If the  snakeheads  or  loan  sharks  go  to  these
   lengths it is  not  likely  that  they  would  risk  deterring  potential
   customers by taking  hostile  action  against  those  who  are  returned,
   usually through no fault of their own. Clearly it is a  different  matter
   to ensure that those who remain abroad and are able to  pay  continue  to
   pay for fear of what might happen to them or their relatives at home.


   In Mr Yuen's 5� page skeleton argument in the present case, he had  quite
   unaccountably not mentioned Liu, even though, as will be  remembered,  he
   had appeared in it himself. We had better repeat  that  unqualified,  but
   paid advocates of any  kind  have  just  the  same  duty  as  counsel  or
   solicitors to draw the attention of tribunals before whom they appear  to
   any relevant citable decisions, whether or not those go against them.  If
   they do not, they will expose themselves to the justifiable suspicion  of
   hoping to mislead the tribunal (whose identity they will be unaware of in
   advance) as to the  state  of  the  law,  or  factual  guidelines.  Their
   professional supervisors, if any, will be at risk of  complaints  leading
   to possible disciplinary action if they fail to draw this duty  to  their
   attention.


   As there seemed to be no meaningful distinction to be drawn on the  facts
   of this case between it and Liu (who by the date of  the  hearing  before
   the Tribunal - see � 5 - was working in this country), we asked  Mr  Yuen
   what, if anything, had emerged since that decision to cast any  different
   light on this kind of situation. He spent some time  expatiating  on  the
   suggestion that here  there  had  been  defects  in  the  decision-making
   process, leading to a justifiable complaint under  �  7.1  of  the  Human
   Rights Act 1998; but he did not say what those defects might have been.


   Nor did Mr Yuen make any attempt to deal with the point we  put  to  him,
   which was that our main r�le under � 65 of the 1999 Act  is  to  consider
   whether carrying out the decision taken  would  infringe  the  claimant's
   human rights. In our view most, if not all defects in the decision-making
   process are intended by Parliament to be remedied by the right to a  full
   hearing before an adjudicator  on  the  merits  of  the  case,  with  the
   possibility of another before  the  Tribunal.  Only  if  defects  in  the
   decision-making process are such as to make a fair hearing on the  merits
   impossible are they likely to result in an appeal being allowed.

6. Mr Yuen referred us  to  no  evidence  which  had  not  been  before  the
   Tribunal in Liu (and in some cases Bin & Bang too). So far as he referred
   to particular items of evidence at all, it was  to  the  country  experts
   relied on by the Home Office in Bin & Bang. Mr  Yuen  suggested  that  Dr
   Fisher's comments about pursuing those who did not get to  stay  in  this
   country being bad for  the  "snakeheads"'  business  were  no  more  than
   expressions of his opinion;  but,  for  the  reasons  given  in  Liu,  we
   consider them eminently logical. Mr Yuen went on to rely on what is  said
   by Dr Chin (at p 203 of his bundle); but that in our view clearly relates
   to risks for those who remain in the destination country.

7. Mr Yuen attempted to rely on a number of decisions by adjudicators,  whom
   he  had  persuaded  to  accept  his  submissions;  but  that  is   wholly
   impermissible, either before us  or  before  adjudicators,  without  some
   particular nexus  between  the  cases  as  individual  cases,  as  recent
   practice directions by both Collins P and the Chief Adjudicator have made
   clear.


8. Mr Yuen's final argument was that the Home  Office  had  failed  to  show
   that there was no risk on return from "loansharks" (or "snakeheads")  for
   persons in this claimant's position. He referred  to  the  report  of  Dr
   Pieke, summarized in the CIPU report  at  �  6A  227,  saying,  no  doubt
   rightly, that there is no evidence of exactly what does happen  in  these
   cases. However, it is enough to express this argument as we have done  to
   show that it puts the burden of proof on the wrong side. It is for  those
   resisting removal to show that it would expose them to treatment contrary
   to the Human Rights Convention, not the other way round.

9. The adjudicator decided this case on the basis  that  the  "abundance  of
   objective evidence" (which she did not particularize) showed that it  was
   inevitable that this claimant and  his  family  would  be  at  risk  from
   "snakeheads" on return to China. As we have seen, that  was  based  on  a
   misunderstanding, promoted by Mr Yuen, of the effect of Bin & Bang, which
   was later cleared up by the Tribunal in Liu. Of  course  the  adjudicator
   could not be expected to anticipate the reasoning in Liu; but we have  no
   doubt that it effectively removes the basis for her decision.
