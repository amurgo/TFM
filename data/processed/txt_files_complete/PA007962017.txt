                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the appellant:     Mr Winter, instructed by Maguire Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr M Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


           DECISION MADE PURSUANT TO RULES 34, 39 & 40 (3) OF THE
               TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

   1. The appellant appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Handley promulgated on 6  October  2019.  Although
      permission to appeal was refused by the Upper Tribunal on 13  February
      2018, that decision  was  reduced  by  the  Court  of  Session  on  an
      application by the appellant.  That  decision  is  supplemented  by  a
      Joint Minute agreed by the parties.

   3. The parties are agreed that, for the reasons  set  out  in  the  joint
      minute and in the grounds, the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      involved the making of an error of law and must be set aside.

   4. Given that the errors went to the issue of credibility,  none  of  the
      findings of fact are to be preserved; the appeal  will  be  remade  on
      that basis. Given also that none of the findings of fact are preserved
      it is appropriate to remit this case to the First-tier Tribunal.


   5. Rule 40 (1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provides that the Upper Tribunal may  give  a  decision  orally  at  a
      hearing which I did. Rule 40 (3) provides that the Upper Tribunal must
      provide written reasons for its decision with a decision notice unless
      the parties have consented to the Upper Tribunal  not  giving  written
      reasons. I am satisfied that the parties have given  such  consent  at
      the hearing.


      Notice of Decision

   1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and is set aside.


   2. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision
      on all issues.
