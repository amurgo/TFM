                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge David C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 28 March 2017.

 2. The appellant's first ground, read shortly (�3 - 4 of the  application)
    is that at �53 the judge gave  manifestly  inadequate  weight  to  some
    considerations and manifestly excessive  weight  to  others;  and  that
    having accepted  certain  evidence  to  the  extent  he  did,  did  not
    apparently have regard to the inherent improbability of a  heterosexual
    woman engaging in sexual  relationships  with  multiple  lesbian  women
    simply to bolster her asylum claim.

 3.  Mr Matthews said that although the respondent would have been prepared
    to argue  against  the  other  grounds  of  appeal,  the  first  ground
    disclosed deficiencies in the judge's consideration of the evidence  of
    the witnesses for the appellant, such as to require  rehearing  in  the
    FtT.

 4. Mr MacKay agreed with that outcome.

 5. On 22 May, the appellant forwarded materials  to  the  UT  directly  by
    email (not through her solicitors).  These are a mixture of submissions
    and evidence, some of it conveyed indirectly in the form  of  a  letter
    from a "caseworker" at "Unity Centre, Glasgow".  The  UT  copied  these
    materials to Mr MacKay and to Mr Matthews in advance  of  the  hearing.
    The supply of materials in this form  was  inappropriate,  particularly
    when the appellant has representation.   The  materials  include  quite
    serious allegations against the respondent and against  the  judge  not
    merely of incompetence but  of  unfairness  or  bias.  These  are  made
    without any proper foundation, and do not correspond with  the  grounds
    of appeal. They were not accompanied by any application  for  admission
    of further evidence, or for amendment of the  grounds.    As  the  case
    developed in the UT,  these  materials  have  played  no  part  in  the
    outcome, so I simply place the matter on record.

 6. The decision of the FtT errs in law, as  conceded  by  the  respondent.
    The decision is set aside. None of its findings  are  to  stand,  other
    than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 7. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge David C Clapham SSC.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
