Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Coleman, instructed by Zahra & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on  26  December  1981.  He
   has been given permission to appeal against the  determination  of  Judge
   Brenells dismissing his  appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision  to
   refuse his application for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  a
   spouse.

2. The appellant applied for settlement in  an  application  form  dated  17
   June 2012. He gave details of his previous  illegal  stay  and  departure
   from the United Kingdom and his previous unsuccessful  applications  made
   in the UK and in Bangladesh. He stated that  he  married  his  wife,  his
   current sponsor, in Bangladesh on 11 August 2009 and had lived  with  her
   for a few weeks after their marriage. They had a son together, born on 28
   December 2011.

3. The appellant's application  was  refused  on  3  October  2012.  In  the
   refusal decision, the respondent referred to the appellant's  failure  to
   advise  the  immigration  and  appeal  authorities  of  his   change   of
   circumstances, following a previous application and appeal as the  fiancï¿½
   of a woman who was not the sponsor, but which took place around the  same
   time as his marriage to the sponsor. The respondent also referred to  the
   refusal of a previous application made on the same  basis  in  which  the
   respondent had been satisfied, in light of  the  appellant's  immigration
   history, that paragraph 320(11) of the immigration rules applied  to  him
   on the  grounds  that  he  had  sought  to  frustrate  significantly  the
   intentions of the immigration rules. Reference was made in  that  refusal
   decision to the fact that he had remained as an overstayer after entering
   as a visitor  in  1996;  that  after  being  served  with  papers  as  an
   overstayer on 10 May 2008 he had failed to comply with the conditions  of
   his temporary release and was listed as an absconder  on  7  April  2008;
   that he had produced a British passport which  was  found  to  contain  a
   counterfeit bio data page; and that he had  made  a  voluntary  departure
   from the United Kingdom and returned to Bangladesh on 15 August 2008.

4. In refusing the  current  application,  the  respondent  noted  that  the
   appellant had only elected to make  a  voluntary  departure  after  being
   encountered by the police on 14  July  2008  with  a  forged  UK  driving
   licence identifying him as a British national and  after  being  detained
   and released on the condition  that  he  left  the  United  Kingdom.  The
   respondent was also aware that the  appellant  had  been  encountered  at
   Dhaka Airport on 12 May 2009 with a UK passport in a  different  identity
   which contained a counterfeit bio-data page and which he had  been  using
   for identity purposes in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in  Bangladesh.  The
   respondent was accordingly satisfied that the appellant had significantly
   contrived to frustrate the intentions of the immigration rules  and  that
   there were aggravating factors and accordingly  refused  the  application
   under paragraph 320(11). The respondent went on to raise  concerns  about
   the validity of the appellant's marriage and his ability  to  accommodate
   and maintain himself in the UK and found that he was also unable to  meet
   the requirements of paragraph 281 of HC 395.

5. Following a review by the Entry Clearance Manager, it was  conceded  that
   the appellant's marriage was valid, although the refusal under  paragraph
   281 (iv)  and  (v)  on  grounds  of  maintenance  and  accommodation  was
   maintained. The respondent maintained the refusal under paragraph 320(11)
   and concluded that the decision did not breach the appellant's Article  8
   human rights.

6. The appellant's appeal was heard in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  Judge
   Brenells on 1 November 2013. Judge Brenells noted that the respondent had
   conceded  the  issue  of  maintenance  and  he  found  himself  that  the
   accommodation provisions of the rules had been satisfied. The only  issue
   before him, therefore, was the application of paragraph 320(11). In  that
   respect, the judge referred to the fact that the appellant  had  had  two
   previous immigration appeals dismissed by the Tribunal in  determinations
   promulgated on 11 March 2009 and 8 March 2011. He rejected the submission
   that the appellant's earlier history should be ignored since it  occurred
   before his earlier appeals and found that  paragraph  320(11)  was  still
   applicable to him. He dismissed the appeal on  that  basis  and  also  on
   Article 8 human rights grounds.

7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought on the ground  that
   the judge had erred by failing to conclude that the respondent's decision
   was unlawful for two reasons. Firstly, there had been a  failure  by  the
   Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) to  obtain  authorisation  from  the  Entry
   Clearance Manager (ECM) for refusing the  application,  contrary  to  the
   UKBA guidance. Secondly, there had been a failure to follow the  guidance
   to the effect that it was only aggravating circumstances occurring  after
   any previous appeal determinations that should be considered.

8. Permission to appeal was granted  on  13  January  2014  on  the  grounds
   raised.

Appeal hearing and submissions

9. At the hearing Mr Bramble acknowledged that the judge had  erred  in  law
   in his consideration of the UKBA guidance with respect  to  both  matters
   raised in the grounds. He submitted that the appeal ought therefore to be
   allowed to the limited extent that the decision was unlawful and that the
   matter had to be remitted to the ECO for reconsideration.

10. Mr Coleman, however, considered that the  appeal  ought  to  be  allowed
   outright on the grounds that  there  were  no  aggravating  circumstances
   since the most recent appeal determination and  that  the  refusal  under
   paragraph 320(11) therefore fell away. The appellant had a two  year  old
   British child who was being separated from his father.

Consideration and findings

11. The relevant UKBA guidance is to be found in the internal  guidance  for
   entry clearance staff, entitled "RFL07 - Frustrating  the  intentions  of
   the Immigration Rules - paragraph 320(11)".

12. The sections of that guidance that  are  particularly  relevant  to  the
   appellant's case are as follows:

    jl"RFL7.4 Aggravating circumstances and appeal determinations

    Full consideration must be given to an applicant's UK immigration
    history, including any appeal determinations, since it is aggravating
    circumstances which have occurred after the appeal determination which
    should be considered.

    RFL7.5 Will I need to refer the case to an ECM?

    Yes. ECOs will need to obtain ECM authorisation for all refusals under
Paragraph 320(11)."
13. It was conceded by Mr Bramble that the ECO's decision did  not  indicate
   that such authorisation was obtained prior to refusal and on  that  basis
   the decision was plainly unlawful. Had  that  been  the  only  issue,  Mr
   Coleman agreed that the correct course would be  for  the  appeal  to  be
   allowed only on that limited basis.

14. However, it was also conceded  by  Mr  Bramble  that  the  decision  was
   unlawful on the basis that  the  respondent  had  failed  to  follow  the
   guidance in  RFL7.4.  It  was  Mr  Coleman's  submission  that  that  was
   sufficient in itself for the appeal to be allowed outright.  Accordingly,
   the issue before me is whether that failure ought to result in the matter
   going back to the ECO or in the appeal being allowed outright.

15. It seems to me that the appeal has  to  be  allowed  outright,  for  the
   following reasons.

16. Paragraph 320(11) provides  that  entry  clearance  or  leave  to  enter
   should normally be refused:

    "(11) where the applicant has previously contrived in a significant way
    to frustrate the intentions of the Rules by:
    (i) overstaying; or
    (ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or
    (iii) being an illegal entrant; or
    (iv) using deception in an application for entry clearance, leave to
    enter or remain or in order to obtain documents from the Secretary of
    State or a third party required in support of the application (whether
    successful or not); and
    there are other aggravating circumstances, such as absconding, not
    meeting temporary admission/reporting restrictions or bail conditions,
    using an assumed identity or multiple identities, switching
    nationality, making frivolous applications or not complying with the re-
    documentation process."

17. The relevant guidance states at section RFL7.1:

    "RFL7.1 When can I refuse under 320 (11)?

    This is a discretionary refusal where an applicant has:
     . been an immigration offender or in breach of UK immigration or other
       law; and / or
     . received services or support to which they were not entitled;
    and where there are aggravating circumstances.
    It is not sufficient to have been in breach of immigration law or to be
    an immigration offender. There must be aggravating circumstances as
    well."
18. It is thus clear from the guidance that there  have  to  be  aggravating
   circumstances in order for the discretion under paragraph 320(11)  to  be
   exercised. That is a mandatory requirement under  the  guidance.  Section
   RFL7.4, as set above, also  includes  what  appears  to  be  a  mandatory
   requirement,  namely  that  it  is  only  the  aggravating  circumstances
   occurring  after  previous  appeal   determinations   which   should   be
   considered. In the appellant's case, it was accepted by  Judge  Brenells,
   at paragraph 20 of his determination,  that  there  had  been  no  recent
   attempts by the appellant to circumvent the immigration  rules.  Clearly,
   the aggravating circumstances upon which he relied in refusing the appeal
   were those that had occurred prior to the determination promulgated on  8
   March 2011. It is relevant to note that that determination related to  an
   application made on the same basis as that  currently  made,  namely  for
   entry clearance as the spouse of the current sponsor. Not only has  there
   been no question of any  further  aggravating  circumstances  since  that
   time, but it is also relevant to note that circumstances  have  moved  on
   since then as the appellant and his spouse have  had  a  child,  born  in
   December 2011.

19. Accordingly, it seems to me that the respondent has failed to  discharge
   the burden of proving  that  paragraph  320(11)  was  applicable  to  the
   appellant and that that part of the reasons for refusal has therefore  to
   fall away.  Significantly,  that  was  the  only  basis  upon  which  the
   appellant's appeal failed before Judge Brenells since  it  was  otherwise
   accepted that he met all the requirements of paragraph 281 of HC 395.  In
   the circumstances the appellant's appeal falls to be  allowed  under  the
   immigration rules.

DECISION

20. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The decision has been set aside.  I
   re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it under  the  immigration
   rules.
