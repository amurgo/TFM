For the Respondent:


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appeal in this case against the decision of  the  First-tier  Judge
    who dismissed the appellant's appeal was due to be heard in  Birmingham
    on 6 February 2019.  It is common ground  between  the  representatives
    that the judge's  decision  is  flawed  by  errors  of  law  and  as  a
    consequence it is also common ground that the  matter  requires  to  be
    considered  de  novo  by  a  different  First-tier   Judge.    In   the
    circumstances the appeal against the decision is allowed to the  extent
    that it is remitted for re-hearing at Birmingham before a  judge  other
    than Judge Hussain.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
