                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  a  Decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Callow promulgated on 12th March  2015.   Permission  to
    appeal was granted to the Appellant on the basis of arguable inadequacy
    of consideration of the best interests of the child in the case.

 2. In this appeal the Appellant is a Jamaican national  who  had  appealed
    against a Decision to deport her following  conviction  for  a  serious
    fraud offence and a sixteen month prison sentence.  It is of note  that
    she had a previous eleven month sentence  for  related  offences.   The
    First-tier Tribunal judge quoted the sentencing remarks at paragraph  6
    of the determination indicating that the judge had said:

         "You pleaded guilty to a sequence of very serious  offences  indeed
         involving a total loss to the taxpayer of in  excess  of  ï¿½195,000.
         In effect, from the facts that we have heard about  this  afternoon
         you have essentially lived a lie in this  country  since  the  mid-
         1990s since when you have dishonestly claimed this colossal sum  of
         money, none of which you were entitled to, regardless of what might
         have been the position had you been legally  and  appropriately  in
         this country under the proper name, the fact of the matter  remains
         is that you were not entitled to any of this.

         It follows that only an immediate prison sentence can  possibly  be
         justified for dishonesty on this scale.  Because your offending  is
         connected with the false identity  it  is  clear  to  me  that  you
         carefully planned all this and continued to execute your plan  over
         an extended period of time; that, in my judgment, is an aggravating
         feature underlying already significantly dishonest behaviour.

         I also bear in mind that you have served  an  eleven  month  prison
         sentence for using the  false  passport  to  gain  entry  into  the
         country, and I recognise that there is an important link, albeit  a
         dishonest one, between that offence and these  offences  for  which
         you fall to be sentenced today."

 3. It is clear from the Decision and Reasons  that  the  judge  found  the
    Appellant to be a thoroughly unreliable and dishonest witness  in  that
    she had lied for years about her  identity;  she  had  claimed  British
    nationality to which she was not entitled; she had married  a  Jamaican
    national and gave evidence  at  his  appeal,  all  of  which  based  on
    untruths.  She was not honest about her ties  to  Jamaica,  seeking  to
    hide the fact that she has a married sister and a mother there and that
    she visited there in July 2008, twice in 2009 and again in  2011.   She
    has an adult daughter in the UK who is 38 and  married  with  children.
    She also has a son in the UK and the two daughters that she lives with.
    Those younger children were born in October 1996  and  September  1998.
    Only the youngest is a minor and it is  her  best  interests  that  are
    relied upon in the grounds seeking  permission  to  appeal.  Those  two
    younger children had British citizenship by virtue of being born  to  a
    "British" mother.  When mother's fraud  became  known  their  passports
    were revoked.  However, subsequently they  have  been  granted  British
    citizenship and were treated as  British  citizens  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge.

 4. The judge considered the best interests of the minor child at paragraph
    30 although it is fair to say that most of his consideration  consisted
    of setting out case law.  Notwithstanding that the conclusion the Judge
    came to was that it was in the child's best interests to live with  her
    mother. Whether the Judge's consideration of the child's best  interest
    was lacking or not, any error was in her favour. The question then that
    the judge asked was whether her best interests were outweighed by other
    matters.

 5. It is true that the judge misdirected himself as to the appropriate law
    and the relevant Immigration Rules because he set out the Rules as they
    were prior to 28th July 2014 and the requirements since then  are  more
    stringent.   Again,  any  error  was  in  the  appellant's  favour.  By
    referring to the previous version of the Immigration  Rules  the  Judge
    has not specifically addressed whether it would be unduly harsh for the
    child to live in Jamaica with mother or  whether  it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for her to remain in the UK without  mother.   The  mother  being
    sentenced to a period in excess of twelve months  but  less  than  four
    years, the exceptions contained in paragraph 399 may  apply.   She  has
    shown a genuine and subsisting relationship with a child under the  age
    of 18 years  who  is  in  the  UK  and  a  British  citizen  (paragraph
    399(a)(i)).  She must also show that it would be unduly harsh  for  the
    child to live in Jamaica and unduly harsh for the child  to  remain  in
    the UK without her mother (Rule 399(a)(ii)).

 6. Those were not addressed by the Judge. Mr Sharma relies on the Court of
    Appeal's Decision in SSHD v AQ (Nigeria), TH (Bangladesh), CD (Jamaica)
    [2015] EWCA Civ 250 as indicating the appropriate way to consider  such
    cases and where the law currently stands.  He relied on  paragraphs  62
    and 77.  However paragraph 62 contains submissions, not  the  Court  of
    Appeal's findings. It seems to me that the law is set out in  paragraph
    77 where Lord Justice Pitchford said:

         "I agree with Mr Drabble QC that the question to be examined by the
         Tribunal was a  practical  and  not  a  hypothetical  one.   In  my
         judgment this is the effect  of  the  Decisions  of  the  Court  of
         Justice in Dereci and  the  Decision  of  this  court  in  Harrison
         (Jamaica).  I cannot accept the Secretary of State's position  that
         the Tribunal was only required to consider the ability of others to
         care for the child in the UK and was bound to ignore questions such
         as whether a family member would be willing to provide care or  was
         under any familial or other responsibility to do so."

 7. The question to be considered when considering "unduly  harsh"  is  the
    practical effect. The Home Office Presenting Officer before me did  not
    argue otherwise. Thus what has to be considered is the practical effect
    of the removal of the mother and whether that would mean that the child
    would be obliged to leave the UK.

 8. The fact that the child is a British citizen is an important factor but
    that is recognised in the Rules because it is one of  the  factors  for
    the exception to apply in paragraph 399.  The unduly  harsh  provisions
    would not apply at all if the child was  neither  British  nor  settled
    here for a period of seven years or more.  MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ
    1192 tells us that the Rules are a complete code so far as deportations
    are concerned and it is only if the exceptions do not  apply  that  you
    then look at paragraph 398 to see whether  there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those referred to in paragraph  399  which
    could lead to the appeal being  allowed  and  the  public  interest  in
    deportation being outweighed.

    We are also given guidance in KMO (section 117 - unduly harsh)  Nigeria
    [2015] UKUT 00543 (IAC)  that  the  word  "unduly"  in  "unduly  harsh"
    requires consideration of whether, in the light of the  seriousness  of
    the offences committed by the foreign criminal and the public  interest
    considerations that come into play, the impact on the  child,  children
    or partner of the foreign criminal being deported  is  inordinately  or
    excessively harsh.

 9. So the question in this case, the judge having made an error  in  terms
    of looking at the wrong version of the Rules, is  would  it  be  unduly
    harsh because, if it would not, then any error is immaterial and if  it
    would, the error is material.

10. It is clear from the judge's sentencing remarks that the offences  were
    serious.  Mother has lied about her identity for years to gain  support
    and advantages to which she was not entitled.  Her behaviour  drives  a
    coach and horses through immigration control.  Bearing  that  in  mind,
    the facts as found by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  were  that  mother
    has family and connections in Jamaica and there are both education  and
    medical facilities there. Unduly harsh  means  more  than  just  harsh,
    uncomfortable or difficult, and the answer to the question in this case
    I find is that it would not be unduly harsh for the child  to  live  in
    Jamaica with her mother.

11. However, as a British citizen she  cannot  be  forced  to  go  and  the
    question alternatively and in that event is whether it would be  unduly
    harsh  for  her  to  remain  without  her  mother.  Again  I  take  the
    seriousness of the offences into account and note that mother has twice
    through her own actions separated herself from her  minor  child,  when
    she was even younger than she is now, by committing  criminal  offences
    and spending time in prison.  It is of note  that  during  that  period
    there was no requirement for Social Services  to  be  involved  because
    with the involvement and care of her two older sisters  the  child  was
    able to remain in her own home.  In other words, she has lived  without
    her mother before with her older sister, now 19, and  overseen  by  her
    sister who is 38. She is not an infant. On  that  basis  I  find  that,
    looking at it in practical terms, mother's absence  would  not  require
    this child to leave the country and she could remain  with  her  family
    members if she chose to do so.

12. So far as very  compelling  circumstances  are  concerned,  these  were
    considered by the judge and he found that there were none, and  on  the
    facts as found, the public interest in deportation and the fact that it
    would not be unduly harsh either for the child  to  go  to  Jamaica  or
    remain in the UK with her sisters I do not find the errors by the judge
    to be material.  The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is thus dismissed.
