Miss A Jones (counsel instructed by Bhogal Lal) for the appellant
Mr A Sheikh for the respondent

                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Professor A Grubb),
   sitting at Cardiff on 18 December 2003, dismissing an asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a Sikh citizen of Afghanistan. Permission to appeal was
   given on the basis that the Tribunal needed to give general guidance  to
   adjudicators on the situation facing such persons on return. For reasons
   which will become all too clear, it has not been possible  to  do  this:
   the present decision is not a 'country guidance'  case,  and,  while  it
   will be reported as a contribution to  the  continuing  debate,  neither
   adjudicators nor other panels of the Tribunal will be expected to follow
   it as such. The main reason it is being  reported,  as  the  "key-words"
   make clear, is on what we have to say about the filing of evidence.  The
   potential error of law on the part of the adjudicator relates to whether
   his general approach to the risks faced by Sikhs as such in  Afghanistan
   was correct or not: for the reasons which appear at 2-3,  his  decision,
   and ours, turn entirely on that approach.

2. There was an issue taken  in  the  refusal  letter  as  to  whether  the
   appellant was from Afghanistan at all. Given the remarkable ignorance of
   that country she displayed at interview (see the  adjudicator's  ��  36-
   40), she might be considered extremely lucky to have  secured  even  the
   limited credibility finding in her favour she did on that point. All the
   adjudicator was prepared to say at � 42 was that there was no reason  to
   doubt she was a Sikh,  and  she  might  at  some  point  have  lived  in
   Afghanistan. Contrary to Miss Jones's energetic submissions, there is no
   finding of fact that she came from Jalalabad as  she  claimed;  nor  can
   there be any place for the contentions advanced by Mr  Sheikh  based  on
   the individual case comprehensively rejected by the adjudicator.

3. This in fact is the irreducible minimum case  of  a  Sikh  woman  facing
   return to Afghanistan,  without  any  other  individual  factors  to  be
   considered at all. It should have been an ideal vehicle for dealing with
   the general risk for such persons there, and particularly in  Kabul,  as
   the point of return. This has already been comprehensively, and recently
   treated by the Tribunal (Barnes and Perkins VPP) in IB & TK [2004] UKIAT
   000150, to which  we  shall  refer  as  IB  150.  IB  150  featured  two
   appellants, B from Jalalabad and K from Kabul.

4. The Tribunal there found no well-founded fear of persecution  for  Sikhs
   in Kabul generally (see � 40); and consequently (� 41) none there for  B
   on his individual history, which  did  not  relate  to  that  city.  K's
   individual history in Kabul was considered at � 46;  but  not  found  to
   raise any real risk on return there for him either; so  his  appeal  was
   dismissed. The only basis on which B's succeeded was that, since it  had
   been conceded by the Home Office before the Tribunal (see � 41) that  he
   did have a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in  Jalalabad,  he  was
   entitled to, and did show that it would be 'unduly  harsh'  for  him  to
   return to Kabul. Apart from - or it might as easily be said because of -
   his not  having  any  personal  connexions  there,  the  basis  for  the
   Tribunal's decision in his favour on that point (at ��  43-45)  was  the
   general situation facing Sikhs in Kabul.

5. How far a general finding of  that  kind  (as  opposed  to  one  on  the
   claimant's individual circumstances) on  the  'unduly  harsh'  (Robinson
   [1997] Imm AR 568) point as to  return  to  a  particular  location  may
   accord with a general finding that persons of the class in question  are
   not at any real risk there, in terms of AE & FE [2003] EWCA Civ 1032, is
   something the Tribunal might have had to consider in this case; but,  as
   will shortly become clear, that must be for  another  day,  and  perhaps
   another place.

6. We had better start by saying that we  heard  no  argument  or  evidence
   which in any way led us to differ from the very thorough analysis of the
   background evidence in IB 150 as it stood then;  nor  was  anything  put
   before us that has since emerged from the public domain that could  have
   led us to do so. That made it all the more important that proper  notice
   should have been given of the one  piece  of  evidence  bearing  on  the
   general situation for Sikhs (and Hindus) in Kabul on which this decision
   turns.

7. The general directions on filing evidence in cases before  the  Tribunal
   are given in the notice of hearing, which in this case went out  to  the
   appellant and his solicitors on 7 April, for 16 July. That required them
   to file with the Tribunal and serve on the Home Office all the documents
   on which they proposed to  rely,  no  later  than  14  days  before  the
   hearing. The evidence with which we are  dealing  consists  in  a  typed
   English statement by Mr Ravinder Singh, dated, and apparently  faxed  to
   the solicitors on or about 14 June. (Mr Ravinder Singh had made previous
   statements, one of which was considered by the Tribunal in  IB  150:  we
   shall return to the details of that, and this one in due course).

8. What the solicitors did with the 14 June statement when they got it  was
   to confirm its contents, with one significant addition, in  a  telephone
   conversation between their Mr HK Caleechurn (see  his  statement  of  12
   July) and Mr Ravinder Singh, through an interpreter, on 18 June. Why  it
   should have required the use of an interpreter to  confirm  a  statement
   made in perfect English was something  that  concerned  us.  Miss  Jones
   explained, on instructions, that the English statement was something  Mr
   Ravinder Singh had produced through another person in Kabul who knew the
   language.

9. We should make it clear that  it  is  not  acceptable  practice  to  put
   forward statements as the original work of the maker, when a third party
   has been involved in that way: there should be at least some endorsement
   by that person. However, as a solicitor has confirmed  the  contents  of
   this one, we were not prepared to reject it on that ground. It  is  what
   was then done with it that concerns us. There can  clearly  be  no  good
   reason, in the face of the directions in the notice of hearing requiring
   all evidence at latest by 2 July, for why a telephone  conversation  had
   by a solicitor on 18 June should  have  to  wait  till  12  July  to  be
   confirmed in a statement from him, or till that same day to be filed  or
   served on the Home Office.

10. This was a point of serious concern to us when it emerged: it  had  been
   compounded by the solicitors' failure to list the 14 June  statement  by
   Mr Ravinder Singh in the index to the bundle served on the  Home  Office
   on 12 July (though it did appear as an index item in  the  supplementary
   bundle in which it came to us). That meant that the existence of the  14
   June statement did not become apparent to Mr Sheikh till Miss Jones took
   us through it, in some detail: we should make it clear that this was not
   the result simply of his not taking the trouble to read his papers,  but
   of an unfortunate misunderstanding by him  as  to  the  terms  on  which
   permission to appeal had  been  granted,  and  in  consequence  of  what
   material could be relevant to the issues. It is a pity he did  not  take
   that point when Miss Jones began to go through the  statement,  when  we
   could immediately have disillusioned  him,  and  considered,  very  much
   earlier, what should be done about it.

11. In our view that lack of any description in the bundle provided  to  the
   Home Office is, on the most charitable view, a most inadequate practice.
   Not only should all evidence filed be properly  indexed  and  paginated;
   but when, as here, it is a question not  of  evidence  from  the  public
   domain, but of that of a single private witness,  it  ought  to  be  the
   subject of an immediate application to a  vice-president  for  leave  to
   adduce it, which should ensure that the Home Office are properly put  on
   notice,  not  only  as  to  its  existence,  but  as  to  its  potential
   significance.

12. In view of our concern about this, we gave  Miss  Jones  the  chance  to
   take instructions over the lunch adjournment  as  to  why  the  14  June
   statement was not filed or served till 12 July. The best that she  could
   do to excuse the solicitors was by saying that their file on this  case,
   with others, had been with the Legal Services Commission  for  audit  at
   the time in question: the solicitors were said to have made a number  of
   urgent requests to have it back before they got it. We are aware of  the
   dependence of a number of organizations in  the  legal  field  on  paper
   files; but we still cannot understand why a potentially crucial piece of
   evidence, in an imminent case before the highest body with  jurisdiction
   to consider its factual merits, should have been  left  to  languish  on
   some pending tray while its mother file was called for.

13. Miss Jones's explanation for this, on behalf of those  instructing  her,
   was that this was not the only pending case they had about the safety of
   Sikhs in Kabul. While that may well be so, it was  certainly  the  first
   one to be listed before the Tribunal, and they ought  to  have  realized
   that it was likely to be treated as the leading decision on  the  point.
   (The Tribunal now has a system for identifying such points, and  listing
   cases in which they arise, so as to ensure consistency of decisions). If
   we thought the solicitors had been deliberately holding back the 14 June
   statement  in order to spring it on the Home Office at the last  moment,
   then their conduct would have been, in lay terms, a  professional  foul;
   and, in ours, the subject of an immediate, and very serious complaint to
   the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors.

14. We are however prepared to accept in  the  solicitors'  favour,  on  the
   strength of the assurances we were given about their dealings  with  the
   Legal Services Commission, that their  failure  to  serve  the  14  June
   statement within the time given in the notice of hearing, or within  any
   reasonable  time,  was  not  deliberate,  but  the  product   of   sheer
   incompetence and inefficiency on the part  of  those  dealing  with  the
   case, and, on the part of the firm as a whole, the lack  of  any  proper
   system for dealing with cases when a file is called for by that body. We
   find it a little hard to understand why the  Legal  Services  Commission
   should have to conduct a physical audit  of  a  file  during  the  month
   before a second appeal is pending; but we realize that  the  funding  of
   asylum and human rights litigation is a matter of grave public  concern,
   and that must be a matter for them.

15. Especially given that grave concern, a mere  expression  of  disapproval
   from us cannot be the end of this: what we are going to do is to send  a
   copy of this  decision  to  the  Legal  Services  Commission,  with  the
   suggestion that they should take what we have  said  into  account  when
   assessing the solicitors' remuneration for the case.  No  doubt  if  the
   Legal Services Commission accept the blame for keeping their  file  when
   asked to send it back,  then  they  will  refrain  from  penalizing  the
   solicitors to that extent. If so, it will  be  for  the  Legal  Services
   Commission to make their own peace with the National  Audit  Commission,
   and we are not concerned with that. It is always  important  for  proper
   notice to be given of any fresh evidence; but the reason why it  was  of
   such importance in the present case is that it was to be the first,  and
   leading one in a series for which it was to provide general guidance.

16. We now turn to the 14 June statement  itself. It has  to  be  considered
   against the background of what was said about Mr Ravinder  Singh  in  IB
   150. The Tribunal reviewed his previous statement (3 December  2003)  at
   �� 29-30, and evidence from an Afghanistan  �migr�  organization  called
   APAMR at �� 31-32. At � 33 they said this:

   We have taken into account that the testimony of  members  of  the  Sikh
   community here and the statement of Mr Ravinder Singh cannot be regarded
   as disinterested sources of evidence but  the  detailed  evidence  which
   they, like APAMR, provide, is not generally inconsistent with the thrust
   of the international reports which we have considered.


17. That is very far from the general acceptance which Miss Jones  suggested
   Mr Ravinder Singh's previous evidence had received;  but  it  does  show
   that his existence, as (see IB 150 � 29) "... a member of the  emergency
   Loya  Jirga  in  2002  and  a  representative  of  the  Hindu  and  Sikh
   communities based in Kabul ..." had emerged into the  public  domain  in
   this country, in rather a prominent context, in which the  Tribunal  had
   certainly not rejected his evidence out of hand. It had not  of  course,
   as it then stood, led them to  regard  Kabul  as  generally  unsafe  for
   Sikhs; and as we have already said, we see no reason whatever to  differ
   from them on that score, as the evidence stood before them.

18. The crucial difference between that situation, and the  one  before  us,
   comes in the 14 June statement. The significant part of this  relates  a
   series  of  incidents  involving  Sikhs  or  Hindus  in  Kabul,  and  Mr
   Caleechurn's note of  the  telephone  conversation  adds  the  important
   detail that they had all  happened  within  the  six  weeks  before  the
   statement was made. Mr Ravinder Singh says the  information  is  "within
   his own personal knowledge": it is obvious enough from the context  that
   he must mean that he has heard about the incidents first-hand from those
   involved for us not to suspect him of claiming  to  have  been  an  eye-
   witness. He says those  persons  "...  wish  to  have  their  identities
   concealed for sake of their safety", and refers to them by letters A-H.

19. Each of these cases involves casual street violence  by  Muslim  Afghans
   on a Sikh or Hindu. In each case, except for E, there is some indication
   in the conduct of the aggressors that they have  either  selected  their
   victim on that basis, or that the victim's traditional dress (wearing  a
   turban in the case of a man, or not wearing a veil  in  the  case  of  a
   woman) has formed the basis for some particular humiliation.  Mr  Sheikh
   suggested that they amounted to no more than discrimination: we  do  not
   agree. While only D, a Hindu, was knocked out, and none of  the  victims
   suffered any serious physical injury, these were very nasty incidents of
   street hooliganism with a religious or racial pretext, which would  have
   been regarded as of grave concern if they had happened in this country.

20. While we accept from Mr Sheikh that  such  incidents  are  by  no  means
   unknown here, that does not mean they are tolerated,  and  that  is  the
   crucial point. Mr Ravinder Singh says

   ... the families of these victims are very frightened  to  report  these
   practices to the authorities and although  I  have  tried  to  encourage
   them, they have refused because they have lost trust and  confidence  in
   the new administration and also because of the important factor that the
   police force consists of former members of the Mujahideen.  Additionally
   they fear reprisals from their assailants.

   This is of course an easy explanation for members  of  any  minority  in
   difficulties to give for not  enlisting  the  protection  of  the  state
   authorities; and lack  of  protection  is  an  essential  ingredient  of
   persecution: see Horvath [1999] INLR 7.

21. There is evidence in the CIPU report as to the numbers of  police  under
   recruitment, and we do not accept Miss  Jones's  suggestion  that  those
   numbers were in themselves inadequate, because we think  she  failed  to
   realize the  distinction  being  drawn  between  commissioned  and  non-
   commissioned officers: clearly the Afghan police has been set up on what
   we should consider a military, rather than  a  police  model.  The  real
   point, however, concerns the  attitude,  and  not  the  numbers  of  the
   police, and on this there is no background evidence. We  think  what  Mr
   Ravinder Singh says, although inevitably it relates to their attitude as
   seen by the Sikhs, and not as it really is, does give cause for concern,
   which has not so far been dealt with.

22. So far as ISAF [International Security Assistance Force]  is  concerned,
   the Tribunal in IB 150 at � 38 make clear that  they  do  not  intervene
   unless asked to do so by the interim administration,  and  there  is  no
   evidence of any such requests. While so far the street violence suffered
   by Sikhs and Hindus is not too serious, the fact that it occurs  at  all
   in the form related by Mr Ravinder Singh suggests at least a  perception
   on the part of Muslim hooligans that their victims will not receive  any
   effective protection  from  the  State  authorities;  and  without  that
   perception, such incidents might not happen. It certainly does not  show
   any deliberate systematic persecution on the part of those  authorities;
   but it does show a real risk of lack of effective  protection  from  the
   system in place. To use a perhaps rather superficial  analogy,  this  is
   not by any means Germany 1941; but it may be Germany 1936.

23. If Mr Ravinder Singh's evidence had been capable of direct  verification
   or the reverse by either British or Afghan authorities in Kabul, then we
   should at least have adjourned our hearing so Mr  Sheikh  could  arrange
   for that to be done. We could not however see how it could be  achieved.
   There may be some answer to what he says, and we gave leave for  further
   evidence or submissions to be filed, with which we shall now deal.

24. Mr Sheikh's answer to Mr Ravinder Singh is in four parts:

   a) the evidence is unsourced, undated, unlocated and uncorroborated;
   b) even if it is accepted, the examples given do not amount to Convention
      persecution or ill-treatment;
   c) the report of the Danish fact-finding mission of 20 March  -  2  April
      2004 (attached) suggests that Sikhs who are not  converts  from  Islam
      have no problems in living in Afghanistan; and
   d) they are indeed going about their daily lives,  as  appears  from  the
      background of Mr Ravinder Singh's letters.


25. Miss Jones's reply to that (also  served  on  the  Presenting  Officers'
   Unit) is at much greater  length.  In  view  of  the  quite  inexcusable
   conduct (see above) of her solicitors in not serving Mr Ravinder Singh's
   evidence till three  days  before  the  hearing,  we  find  it  hard  to
   understand how she can complain of the Danish report being served at the
   present stage, when she has had full opportunity to  deal  with  it.  We
   were quite ready to entertain any material with a bearing on Mr Ravinder
   Singh's evidence, and shall discuss the Danish  report  on  its  merits,
   together with the other issues in the case.

26. The first, at a) in Mr Sheikh's submissions, is on  the  credibility  of
   Mr Ravinder Singh's evidence. While we note what Mr  Sheikh  says  about
   the lack of supporting detail, we accept, as we have already made  clear
   at 18, that a non-lawyer might quite reasonably use "within my  personal
   knowledge" as meaning "told to me direct". The incidents are all  placed
   in Kabul, which is Mr Ravinder Singh's home area, and, according  to  Mr
   Caleechurn's statement, happened within the last six  weeks  before  the
   letter of 14 June. That is perhaps the  least  satisfactory  feature  of
   this evidence; but this on the other hand is a point where only a lawyer
   might have realized the importance of precise dates.

27. The Tribunal in IB 150 did  not  exactly  make  a  positive  finding  of
   credibility in Mr Ravinder  Singh's  favour;  but  they  did  treat  his
   evidence as acceptable. It is presented in an attractively moderate way;
   until more is known about him, we think it would be wrong to dismiss  it
   as not even doubtfully true (see Karanakaran [2000] Imm AR 271).

28. So far as b), the persecution or "inhuman or degrading treatment"  issue
   is concerned, we do not regard it  as  so  self-evident  as  Miss  Jones
   suggests. Some at least of incidents A - H may  be  on  the  borderline,
   viewed in isolation in terms of the victim's  individual  case.  However
   that is not how we have to look at them. The question for us is whether,
   taken together, they show a real risk of  serious violence  directed  at
   Sikhs generally, with no effective protection from the authorities.  For
   the reasons we have given at 22, we take the view that they do.

29. The next question, on c), is whether the Danish report  is  sufficiently
   authoritative to  negate  the  picture  shown  in  Mr  Ravinder  Singh's
   evidence. (Dr Lau's report was not referred to in any detail before  us,
   and, before serious reliance is placed on it,  we  think  it  should  be
   tested by cross-examination, as is  to  happen  in  another  forthcoming
   'country guidance' case). While we do not think the charge  of  repeated
   unwarranted optimism levelled against the  Danish  Foreign  Ministry  by
   Miss Jones is made out, she might have  been  on  stronger  ground  with
   their reliance on the 'Co-operation Centre for  Afghanistan'  (CCA),  if
   they had said no more about that body than appears in  Mr  Sheikh's  own
   submissions.

30. However, if Miss Jones had looked  as  far  as  the  list  of  'Persons,
   organizations and authorities who were consulted' at p 75 of the  Danish
   report, she would have seen the following entry for  the  CCA,  under  a
   list of names and qualifications of its officers:

   The  CCA  is  an  Afghan  NGO,  which  is  supported  by  a  number   of
   international aid organizations including Netherlands  Organisation  for
   International Development, Norwegian Church Aid, Church  World  Service,
   USAID and various UN organizations.  The  organization  was  founded  in
   1990. Since 1994 the CCA has managed the human rights program [sic]. The
   organization is involved in activities concerning women,  education  and
   human  rights.  The  organization  has  offices  in   Afghanistan,   and
   specifically in Kabul ...

31. We do not think the CCA can by any means be written off as a  body  with
   no substance: there is no reason why its views  should  not  be  treated
   with respect, so far as they relate to its particular areas of  concern.
   However, there is nothing to show that these  include  the  position  of
   Sikhs or other minorities; and, bearing in mind at  the  same  time  the
   danger of partiality on the part of those (such as  Mr  Ravinder  Singh)
   who do concern themselves with the affairs of a particular minority, our
   view is that more attention needs to be paid to detailed accounts  of  a
   particular kind of problem, such as he gives, than to general assurances
   that all is well with the minority  in  question,  such  as  the  Danish
   report provides.

32. Turning finally to d), it clearly is true that the  incidents  described
   in Mr Ravinder Singh's evidence take place against a background evidence
   of Sikhs going about the  ordinary  business  of  life.  That  might  be
   incompatible with serious current persecution  of  the  community  as  a
   whole; but is it necessarily so with the existence of a real risk of  it
   in any individual case? That is the question we have to decide.

33. Again we return to the analogy, we hope not too facile a one,  which  we
   drew at 22. In real life, we suspect people do go about  their  ordinary
   business for as long as they possibly can. Only at times of  crisis  do,
   or can they withdraw to a state of siege. No doubt the Jews  in  pre-war
   Germany, subject to the various restrictions on employment, commerce and
   the professions, were going on with their ordinary lives  as  best  they
   could. The situation facing Sikhs in Afghanistan is clearly, even  on  a
   basis of potential risk, nothing anywhere near as bad as  what  happened
   to that most unfortunate minority.

34. However, Mr Ravinder Singh's evidence, which  for  present  purposes  we
   have decided we ought to accept as passing the  Karanakaran  threshhold,
   does  appear  to  show  three  things.  First,  there  is  a  reasonable
   likelihood of at least moderately serious violence against Sikhs because
   they are Sikhs; second, that is encouraged, and not guarded  against  by
   the perpetrators' perception of the authorities' attitude to it;  third,
   there  is  nothing  to  show  any  specific  commitment  by  either  the
   international forces, or the Afghan authorities, to  the  protection  of
   minorities generally, or the Sikhs in particular. In our view those  add
   up to a real risk of persecution at the present time: that is  certainly
   not to say that all Sikhs are being persecuted;  but,  on  the  evidence
   available to us (which was not in its present form before  the  Tribunal
   in IB 150), any of them who are identifiable as such run a real risk  of
   it.

35. We did canvass the question,  not  raised  by  the  adjudicator,  as  to
   whether this claimant in particular would be so identifiable.  While  it
   is not the custom for Sikh, as for Muslim women in Afghanistan  to  wear
   the veil, there is no religious prohibition (any more than there is  for
   Christian women) against their doing so. However we  saw  this  claimant
   present in court, and have no doubt (from many years'  joint  experience
   of hearing both Afghan and Punjabi cases) that, without  the  veil,  she
   could be identified as either a Sikh or Hindu,  and  not  an  indigenous
   Muslim lady. The question of whether she could reasonably be expected to
   take the veil for her own safety (if that is the right  way  of  putting
   it) raises complicated and far-reaching issues, with  which  we  do  not
   think it right to deal in this appeal, since they were not taken  before
   the adjudicator.

36. Until Mr Ravinder Singh's evidence has  been  authoritatively  confirmed
   or disproved from some official source, it would be wrong  to  give  our
   decision (which, so far as it differs from that in IB 150, relies on  it

   best we can with the individual  case before us, and, for the reasons we
   have given at � 34, we do think there was  a  real  risk  of  Convention
   persecution or ill-treatment in this case, even on the minimal  findings
   of fact made by the adjudicator in the appellant's favour.
