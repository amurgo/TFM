For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Davison, Douglass Simon Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cohen promulgated on  28  September  2015,  in  which  he  allowed  the
    respondent's appeal against a decision to remove him  from  the  United
    Kingdom.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Pooler on
    12 February 2016.

Anonymity

 3. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 4. The respondent is a national of Bangladesh, born on 23 August 1988.  He
    was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 migrant  from
    25 August  2009  until  31  October  2013.  On  30  December  2013  his
    application for further leave to remain under Tier 4  was  refused  and
    his appeal against that decision was dismissed on 12  May  2014.  On  7
    August 2014, the appellant applied for  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules, in order to continue his studies in  the  United  Kingdom.  That
    application was refused on 9 January 2015 under paragraph 322(1) of the
    Rules. The decision was said to attract no right of appeal because  the
    appellant had no leave to remain at the time of the application.

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In his  grounds  of
    appeal, it was asserted that  the  appellant  had  a  right  of  appeal
    because he had previously made a human rights  claim  as  part  of  his
    application dated 6 August 2014. He  also  made  reference  to  an  EEA
    national fianc�e. A paper consideration of  the  appeal  was  initially
    requested.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The issue of jurisdiction was conceded at the hearing before the  FTTJ.
    The FTTJ also heard the  appeal  of  the  appellant's  claimed  fianc�e
    (IA/06790/2015) and allowed the fianc�e's appeal under the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and the  respondent's  appeal
    on human rights grounds, outside the Rules. He found that  the  fianc�e
    had not attempted to enter into a marriage of  convenience  and  in  he
    concluded that the respondent and his fianc�e were  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting "durable" relationship.

The grounds of appeal

 7. The application for permission related only to the respondent  and  not
    his claimed fianc�e. In essence, the grounds argue that the FTTJ failed
    to have regard to the considerations required under sections 117A and B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in  performing  his
    proportionality assessment; there had been no consideration of the fact
    that the respondent entered the United Kingdom as a student;  that  the
    respondent's work was incidental to his studies; that the  relationship
    was formed after the respondent's previous appeal was  dismissed;  that
    he had treated Article 8 as a  general  dispensing  power  and  he  had
    failed "to consider why the (respondent) had made an application to the
    Secretary of State under 8(5) of the EEA regulations as a partner."



 8. Permission to appeal was granted as  it  was  considered  that  it  was
    arguable   that   the   FTTJ   misdirected   himself   by   considering
    proportionality without first considering whether there were compelling
    circumstances which might give rise to the grant of leave  outside  the
    Rules and that he failed to consider the matters encompassed by section
    117B of the 2002 Act. Permission to appeal was not expressly refused.

 9. The respondent's Rule 24 response was received on  7  March  2016.  The
    Secretary of State's appeal was opposed. It was argued that FTTJ  Cohen
    properly  directed  himself  as  to  whether  there   were   compelling
    circumstances which might give rise to the grant of leave  outside  the
    Rules; that the FTTJ had  regard  to  the  relevant  facts  which  were
    encompassed within Section 117B including the respondent's  immigration
    status and the legitimate aim of immigration control. In  finding  that
    the respondent and  his  fianc�e  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship, the FTTJ had  found  as  fact  that  the  respondent  was
    entitled to live and work in the United Kingdom on the  basis  of  that
    relationship and that the public interest would not be  served  by  the
    removal of the respondent.

The hearing

10. The arguments before me were brief. Essentially, Mr  Bramble  stood  by
    the grounds of appeal and argued that the  decision  and  reasons  were
    muddled, but covered both Article 8 outside the  Rules  and  Regulation
    8(5).  He  argued  that  the  FTTJ  had  erred  in   his   freestanding
    consideration of Article 8, which made no allusion to section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act.

11. Mr Bramble also argued that the FTTJ had also  erred  in  treating  the
    respondent's ability to speak English and earning capacity as  positive
    factors to be considered in the  balancing  exercise  and  he  had  not
    addressed   the    respondent's    precarious    immigration    status.
    Notwithstanding, the foregoing points, Mr  Bramble  conceded  that  the
    FTTJ's decision would have been the same  even  if  he  had  regard  to
    section 117B and that he had reached the right result. He  stated  that
    the Secretary of  State  did  not  dispute  that  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 8(5) were met.

12. In response to my query, Mr Bramble stated that the FTTJ's errors  were
    not material, however the  Secretary  of  State  required  clarity.  He
    suggested that the decision to allow be  upheld,  following  which  the
    respondent could be granted a short period of  Discretionary  Leave  to
    enable him to obtain his documents, marry his fianc�e and apply  for  a
    residence card as an EEA family member, as he wished to do.

13. Mr Davison relied on his, somewhat extensive,  skeleton  argument.   He
    accepted that the decision in question  was  not  the  best  Article  8
    decision he had seen. Unsurprisingly,  he  was  in  agreement  with  Mr
    Bramble. On the basis that FTTJ's factual findings as  to  the  durable
    relationship, were not challenged, he invited me to uphold the decision
    so that an  appropriate  period  of  leave  could  be  granted  to  the
    respondent.



Decision on error of law


14. In view of the fact that it was, rightly, conceded by Mr  Bramble  that
    the errors made by the FTTJ in his Article 8 proportionality assessment
    were immaterial, on account  of  the  unchallenged  findings  that  the
    respondent and his EEA national fianc�e were in a durable relationship,
    I uphold the decision of the FTTJ in its entirety.

15. As agreed by the representatives, I would urge the Secretary  of  State
    to grant the respondent a short period of Discretionary Leave in  order
    to  enable  him  to  marry  his  fianc�e  and  submit  the  appropriate
    application for a Residence Card.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.
