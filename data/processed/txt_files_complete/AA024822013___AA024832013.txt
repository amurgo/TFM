               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                             DECISION AND REASONS


   1. The appellants, citizens of Sri Lanka born on 17 June 1986 and 11  May
      1986 respectively and are husband and  wife.  They  appeal  against  a
      decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Baldwin  who,  in  a
      determination dated 7 November 2013 dismissed the appellants'  appeals
      against a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to grant asylum
      to the first appellant and to refuse to grant leave to remain  as  the
      first appellant's dependant to the second appellant.


   2. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008, the appellants have  been  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
      proceedings and after  their  conclusion,  absent  any  order  to  the
      contrary by the Upper Tribunal or any other Court seised  of  relevant
      proceedings. No report of these proceedings, in whatever form,  either
      during the proceedings or thereafter,  shall  directly  or  indirectly
      identify the appellant. Failure to comply with this order  could  lead
      to a contempt of court.


   3. On the 2nd December 2010, the first appellant applied  for  a  student
      visa in Chennai to study at Greenwich University for an MSc, which was
      issued on the 17th December 2010 valid until 31st May  2012.  He  left
      Sri Lanka with his wife on the 9th January 2011 on his  own  passport,
      arriving in the UK the next day. He did not  complete  the  course  at
      Greenwich University but applied through an agent for  a  post  -study
      work visa which was refused because he says, he was  deceived  by  the
      agent to whom  he  paid  ï¿½3000  who  submitted  a  fraudulent  results
      certificate, transcript and letter.

   4. On the 28th May 2012 he made a claim  for  asylum.  The  Secretary  of
      State refused the claim for asylum and the appellants exercised  their
      right to appeal that decision and the matter came  before  the  First-
      tier Tribunal (Judge Jones  QC)  on  the  3rd  April  2103  and  in  a
      determination promulgated on  the  25th  April  2014  dismissed  their
      appeals. An  application  was  made  for  permission  to  appeal  that
      decision was made which culminated in permission being granted. On the
      24th September2013, the  Upper  Tribunal  found  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal's  refusal  to  admit  the   psychiatric   evidence   to   be
      procedurally unfair and therefore remitted the appeals to  the  First-
      tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing. The appeals duly  came  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal again (Judge  Baldwin)  who.  In  a  determination
      promulgated on the 12th November 2013  dismissed  the  appeals  for  a
      second time. An application was made for permission  to  appeal  which
      was refused by the First-tier Tribunal but permission was  granted  by
      the Upper Tribunal. The matter came before Upper Tribunal McGeachy  on
      the 21st March 2014 who found an error of law in the determination  of
      the First-tier Tribunal and set aside  the  decision  and  listed  the
      hearing as resumed hearing before the Upper Tribunal for  all  matters
      to be considered afresh.


   5. The case came before me on the 11th December 2014  but  could  not  be
      completed and was therefore adjourned part heard.  In  the  interim  a
      letter dated 5th March 2015 has been received notifying  the  Tribunal
      under Rule 17A that the appeals be withdrawn as the Secretary of State
      has granted the appellants refugee status.

   6. Therefore in relation to those appeals they  fall  to  be  treated  as
      abandoned in accordance  with  Section  104(4A)  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
