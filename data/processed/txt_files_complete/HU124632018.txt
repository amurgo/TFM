For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal comes back before me after a hearing on  25  November  2019
    when, after a hearing when I sat with Upper Tribunal Judge  Pickup,  we
    decided that the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Talbot  (the
    "FtJ") contained errors of law such as to require his  decision  to  be
    set aside, and for the decision to be re-made in  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    The further background to the  appeal  is  set  out  in  the  following
    paragraphs of that error of law decision:

         "1.  The appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan,  born  in  1960.   He
             appealed to the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") against a decision
             of the respondent dated 23 May 2018 to refuse leave to  remain
             on Article 8 grounds.  The application was made on  the  basis
             of the appellant's family life as a partner, a parent, and  on
             the basis of his private life.

         2.   His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Talbot  ("the
             FtJ") at a hearing on  7  January  2019  following  which  the
             appeal was dismissed.

         3.   The further background to the appeal is that  the  appellant's
             wife, who is a British citizen, was granted  asylum  after  an
             appeal against a refusal of  asylum  in  2004.  She  became  a
             British citizen in August 2015.  The basis of her asylum claim
             was domestic abuse by her husband  (this  appellant)  and  her
             husband's family.  Her parents also disowned her because  they
             disapproved  of  her  marriage  to  the  appellant.   She  was
             subjected to physical and emotional  abuse  by  the  appellant
             (her husband) and his family.

         4.   The appellant arrived in the UK illegally  in  2003.   He  re-
             established his relationship with his  wife  and  their  three
             children in 2016, as accepted by the FtJ.

         5.   The appellant has three children, born in 1993, 1994 and 1999.
              The youngest child, H, was born on 1 July 1999.  At the  date
             of the application for leave to remain he was  aged  17  years
             and 10 months.  He suffers from moderate learning difficulties
             and speech and language difficulties."

 2. The following are  the  material  paragraphs  from  the  error  of  law
    decision which explain why it was decided that the FtJ erred in law:

         "34. This is  a  case  where,  once  the  FtJ  concluded  that  the
             appellant did not otherwise meet the requirements of the Rules
             under Appendix FM, he  ought  to  have  gone  on  to  consider
             whether under GEN.3.2(2) there were exceptional  circumstances
             rendering the refusal of leave to remain a breach of Article 8
             because such refusal  "would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
             consequences" for the appellant, his  wife  or  H.   It  would
             appear that the FtJ did  not  have  the  assistance  from  the
             parties that he could have expected in terms of paragraph  GEN
             since, as far as can be discerned, neither party referred  him
             to it, either in submissions  or  in  any  skeleton  argument.
             Having said that, GEN 3.2  is  in  fact  referred  to  in  the
             respondent's decision  refusing  leave  to  remain  under  the
             heading   of   "Exceptional    Circumstances".    Furthermore,
             regardless of whether or not the  FtJ  was  referred  to  this
             aspect of the Rules, it is a matter that  he  needed  to  have
             considered.

         35.  Although the FtJ did consider H's circumstances, in particular
             his learning disability, he considered it within  the  context
             of whether there would be insurmountable obstacles  to  family
             life  between  the  appellant  and  his  wife  continuing   in
             Pakistan, and outside the Article 8 Rules. However, he did not
             consider it in terms of the 'unjustifiably harsh consequences'
             test. Before undertaking a consideration of Article 8  outside
             the Rules the FtJ ought to have completed his analysis of  the
             appeal within the Rules, in respect of which paragraph GEN  is
             a part.

         36.  In the circumstances, we are satisfied that the FtJ  erred  in
             law in failing to consider paragraph GEN.  We do not  consider
             that the FtJ's  assessment  of  H's  circumstances  otherwise,
             either within his consideration of the Rules or outside  them,
             is a sufficient basis from which to conclude that  that  error
             of  law  is  not  material,  even  accepting  that  the  FtJ's
             assessment included consideration of H's best interests.

         37.   In  terms  of  the  FtJ's  assessment   of   the   issue   of
             insurmountable obstacles in relation to the appellant and  his
             wife  continuing  their  family  life  in  Pakistan,  it   was
             incumbent on the FtJ to  assess  the  issue  of  unjustifiably
             harsh consequences not only in  relation  to  H  but  also  in
             relation to the appellant and his wife.  Thus, his decision is
             vitiated by error of law for that reason also.

         38.  The assessment of whether,  on  a  self-contained  basis,  the
             FtJ's assessment of the issue of insurmountable  obstacles  is
             flawed in its reasoning in relation to the  difficulties  that
             may arise for the appellant and his wife from their respective
             families on return,  is  more  finely  balanced.  However,  we
             consider that the errors of law which we have identified are a
             sufficient basis from which to conclude that the decision must
             be set aside in terms of its conclusion dismissing the  appeal
             on Article 8 grounds.

         39.  In addition, although we  note  that  the  witness  statements
             before the FtJ do not say much  about  any  difficulties  that
             they might encounter from their families on return,  from  the
             appellant's wife's family in particular, and  the  submissions
             made to the FtJ as recorded in his decision do not raise  this
             as an issue, the FtJ nevertheless made an assessment  of  that
             issue, making observations that do not appear to have been put
             to the appellant.  Thus, he said that  there  was  nothing  to
             suggest that the wider family would take positive measures  to
             cause harm to them now that the marriage  had  been  repaired.
             However, it seems to us that that is an issue  that  ought  to
             have been canvassed at the hearing.

         40.  Similarly, it is evident from the determination of Immigration
             Judge Corke,  who  heard  the  appellant's  wife's  appeal  in
             December 2005, that he accepted her account that she moved  to
             Karachi but was traced there and assaulted by her  brother-in-
             law and others in January  2004.   That  is  some  indication,
             albeit from many years ago, that there was a  persistence  and
             determination in  their  persecution  of  her,  and  that  her
             attempts at relocation failed.

         41.  We also consider that the FtJ's decision fails to analyse  the
             question of where the appellant and his wife, even without  H,
             would live.  If in their home area, there would need  to  have
             been more of an analysis of potential risk, with issues  being
             put to the appellant and his wife in that respect.  If it  was
             to be suggested that  they  could  relocate  with  H,  obvious
             questions arise in the light of his  learning  disability  and
             generally in terms  of  family  support  in  circumstances  of
             hostility from family members."

 3. At the hearing before me for the re-making of the decision, there was a
    further bundle of documents amounting to 41 pages, in addition to those
    that were before the First-tier Tribunal.  The appellant and  his  wife
    gave oral evidence, which I now summarise.

    The oral evidence

 4. The appellant adopted his witness statements  in  examination-in-chief,
    including the updated statement dated 12 February 2020.

 5. In cross-examination he said that he has had no contact with anyone  in
    Pakistan since he came to the UK in 2003.  He has his  mother,  brother
    and sisters there.  He lost contact with them about 17 years  ago.   He
    had not tried to make contact with them  because  he  knows  them  very
    well.  When they say "no" it means "no".  They are quite  strict.   His
    children have not tried to  make  contact  with  them  either.  To  his
    knowledge his wife has not had contact with her family since coming  to
    the UK.

 6. His and his wife's home area is Lahore.  He does not think  that  there
    would be the right to schools or medical facilities for their  son,  H,
    who has learning difficulties.  He had looked on the internet  and  did
    not find any such facilities.   He  had  not  lived  anywhere  else  in
    Pakistan apart from Lahore.

 7. In the UK he had done a few odd jobs.  His son, A, is an  engineer  and
    supports the family.  His wife and children are all  British  citizens.
    A lives with them and H in  the  family  home.   A  could  not  provide
    support for H because he earns between �25,000 and  �30,000  per  annum
    after tax and he does not think he could manage to support H if he, the
    appellant, and his wife went to Pakistan.

 8. He and his wife have to look after  H  because  he  has  real  learning
    difficulties.  His wife is H's carer.  They do hope that H will be able
    to work in the future to support himself although he could not  give  a
    timeframe; maybe in a couple of years.  He is good at computers and  he
    is learning ICT.  However, he cannot support  himself  at  this  stage.
    His wife helps him with food, clothing and everything.  She looks after
    him.

 9. FS, the appellant's wife, adopted her witness statements in examination-
    in-chief.

10. In cross-examination she said that since she arrived in  2004  she  has
    not had any contact with her family.  She has no idea what  family  she
    has in Pakistan.  When she left, she had her parents and  her  siblings
    there.  There are eight brothers and sisters including  her.   She  has
    not met them since 1992 when she got married.

11. She has not tried to make up with them since  she  arrived  in  the  UK
    because her parents had disowned her when  she  married  without  their
    permission.

12. Before she came to the UK she was living in Karachi which is where  she
    left from.  She lived in two different places there.   Her  brother-in-
    law traced her to Karachi in 2004.  He was  very  angry  and  tried  to
    snatch the children away.  He was verbally abusing her.

13. As to whether, if she returned now, she could live somewhere other than
    Karachi where she would not be able to be traced,  she  said  that  her
    parents are very strict.  She married without their permission which is
    a very big sin in their eyes.  She  does  not  think  that  they  would
    forget her.  She has no idea how they would know that she had  returned
    to Pakistan but she knows that they are very, very angry with her.  She
    fears them.

14. She does not think that there  are  schools  for  those  with  learning
    difficulties in Pakistan.  They are not the same as here in the UK.  If
    they are there, they are very expensive.  H has a health and care  plan
    in place but she does not think that that would be available there.

15. She has not worked in the UK because she is H's carer although  she  is
    not recognised as a carer by social services.

16. H could not remain in the UK with her other son A.  H is  too  attached
    to her and her husband.  He  needs  their  help  with  everything,  for
    example cooking and chores.  Her daughter has a child so that makes her
    very busy.  A has a job.   She  has  not  looked  into  whether  social
    services could provide more help with H.

17. They had tried to apply for jobs for H to build his confidence but they
    have not been successful.

18. Her husband is not in contact with his family in Pakistan.

    Submissions

19. Ms Fijiwala accepted that, notwithstanding H's age, his best  interests
    needed to be assessed as it would in the case of the best interests  of
    a child.

20.  I  was  referred  to  paragraph  GEN.3.2.(2)  and  the   question   of
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences" as discussed in Agyarko v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11.

21. The burden of proof was on the appellants in terms  of  establishing  a
    lack of suitable facilities for H and they had not looked into  whether
    such facilities would be available in terms of treatment or  schooling.



22. On return, the appellant would be able to do odd jobs in Pakistan as he
    has done in the UK.  Similarly, there was no reason why his wife  could
    not work.  They could also find work for H in  Pakistan,  as  they  had
    been trying to do here.  H  does  not  need  full-time  care  from  the
    appellant's wife.  The FtJ found that H speaks Urdu.  There would be no
    unjustifiably harsh consequences involved in the  appellant's  removal.
    Although the appellant's wife may have a subjective  fear,  it  is  not
    objectively well-founded.  There had been no contact  between  her  and
    her family for a number of years.  In any event, she would be  able  to
    move to another area.

23. The alternative is for H to remain in the UK  with  their  son  A.   If
    there are financial difficulties they could turn  to  social  services.
    Both the appellant and his wife could work in Pakistan.

24. It is not said that H needs  help  with  his  personal  hygiene.   Even
    though H's sister has a child, she could still provide some support.

25. So far as the public interest is concerned, the appellant had  employed
    deception in relation to the application and appeal in 2009/10  on  the
    basis of claimed long residency.  He had used false documents  and  had
    overstayed by 15 years.  His private life attracts little weight.

26. Similarly, given that the appellant and his wife  re-established  their
    relationship in 2015 when he was unlawfully in the  UK,  little  weight
    should be given to that relationship.  There was no relationship before
    2015, before he arrived in the UK, even though they married in 1992.

27.  Mr  Janjua  submitted  that  there  would   be   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences involved in the appellant's removal,  for  the  appellant,
    his partner, and their son H.  H has a support package until the age of
    25, according to the appellant's wife's evidence.  I  was  referred  to
    the letter from the College (in London) at page 15 of  the  appellant's
    additional  bundle  in  which  it  is  said  that  were  H's  Statutory
    Education, Health and Care Plan ("EHCP") to  be  interrupted  it  would
    have a severe and detrimental impact on his life chances.  The  opinion
    of the author of that letter was that it would be best for H if he were
    allowed to continue on his current programme of study.

28. Mr Janjua further submitted that  the  FtJ's  conclusion  that  if  H's
    parents moved to Pakistan without him it would be a "significant blow",
    amounted to a finding of unjustifiably harsh consequences.   There  was
    no bright-line in terms of dependency and the situation for H outweighs
    the other public interest factors.

29. In terms of the situation for the appellant's wife, Mr Janjua relied on
    his skeleton argument and the various authorities cited there in  terms
    of the risks posed for women in Pakistan in terms of domestic violence.
     I was also referred to an extract, quoted in the appellant's  skeleton
    argument, from the Home  Office  Country  Information  and  Guidance  -
    Pakistan: Women fearing gender-based harm/violence, dated February 2016
    at paragraph 2.3.1.

30. It was submitted that although the appellant's wife  left  Pakistan  in
    2004, given the prevalence of domestic violence  and  that  her  family
    have the means to find her, the fact that a number of years had  passed
    would make no difference.  Aside from Karachi and Lahore, the remaining
    cities in Pakistan are relatively small.

31. In relation to H, I was referred to the Journal of Research in  Special
    Educational Needs at page 37 of the additional bundle, in terms of  the
    provision in that respect that there would be for H  in  Pakistan.   In
    addition, it was submitted that given that H was a British citizen, the
    withdrawal of  the  educational  package  that  he  has  would  have  a
    detrimental impact on him and that would amount to unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences  because  if  he  returns  to  Pakistan  it  would  be   a
    "significant blow".

32. If he was to remain in the UK without his parents, his brother A  would
    need to sacrifice his job to look after H who needs care every day,  in
    terms of  dressing  and  so  forth.   That  care  is  provided  by  the
    appellant's wife.

    Assessment and Conclusions

33. What is said in the appellant's skeleton argument about  the  appellant
    and his wife wishing to spread the Christian faith is not supported  by
    the evidence and no submissions were made  to  me  about  that  matter.
    Accordingly, there is no need for that to be considered further.

34. The parties agreed that the following findings of fact made by the  FtJ
    can be preserved:

       . The appellant is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with  his
         wife who is a British citizen.

       . H was aged 17 years and 10 months at the date  of  the  application
         for leave to remain and as at the date  of  the  decision.  He  was
         almost 19 years and 8 months at the date of the hearing before  the
         FtJ.

       . The appellant and  his  wife  are  familiar  with  the  culture  of
         Pakistan. Urdu is still spoken in their home.  Both of  them  still
         have family members there.

       . It is possible that relations with some  or  all  of  those  family
         members in Pakistan may continue to be strained and that  they  may
         be unwilling to offer them much in the  way  of  support  on  their
         return.

       . There are links with Pakistan through their daughter's  parents-in-
         law who remain living in Pakistan.

       . The appellant's wife suffers from some medical conditions but there
         was no evidence that those  could  not  reasonably  be  managed  in
         Pakistan.

       . The paediatric review dated 4 February  2015  from  Dr  Tsampanaki,
         undertaken a year before the appellant returned to the family home,
         painted a largely positive picture of H's life.  He was said to  be
         happy with no signs of depression or anxiety, has lots of  friends,
         good social skills and is independent in all  self-care  activities
         despite his moderate learning difficulties and speech and  language
         difficulties.  He was said at that time to be slowly becoming  more
         independent.

       . The more recent evidence from the family and school showed that  he
         had further improved in his  confidence,  independence  and  living
         skills since then.

       . If his parents moved to  Pakistan  without  him  this  would  be  a
         "significant blow to him".  However, he would still have his  elder
         brother in the family home who could provide him with at least some
         emotional and practical support.

       . H also has other family members in the  UK  including  his  married
         sister and cousins with whom he met regularly.

       . If the choice was made for H to live with his parents in  Pakistan,
         he would miss some of the services and opportunities that he has in
         the UK and his prospects of fulfilling his potential  may  well  be
         limited.  However, he would be able to maintain the support he gets
         from his parents and (possibly) build up links  with  his  extended
         family in Pakistan.

       . H speaks both Urdu and English, although he cannot  read  or  write
         Urdu and prefers to communicate in English.

       . The appellant has established a private and family life in  the  UK
         and his removal would amount to an inference with that private  and
         family life.

       . There is an element of dependency on the part  of  H  on  both  his
         parents which goes beyond the  normal  emotional  ties  that  exist
         between young people and their  parents.   H's  best  interests  in
         terms of his private and family life are for him to  remain  living
         in the UK with both his parents.

       . The appellant arrived in the UK unlawfully.  He  exercised  serious
         deception in relation to his subsequent efforts to  regularise  his
         stay  (as  he  admitted  in  evidence  before  the  FtJ).   In  the
         application for leave to remain on the grounds of long residence in
         2009, he claimed to have arrived in the UK in 1995, repeating  that
         in the appeal.  He supported  that  (false)  claim  with  extensive
         documentary evidence to show his  continuous  presence  in  the  UK
         since that date.

       . The appellant admitted that all the evidence of his presence in the
         UK between 1995 and 2003/4 was false.

       . The appellant was fully aware that he was  trying  to  mislead  the
         immigration and the judicial authorities.

       . Nevertheless, the core of his evidence in relation  to  the  family
         life that he has re-established with his wife  and  children  since
         2016 was true.

35. In the decision which followed the hearing  on  25  November  2019  the
    relevant paragraphs of the Immigration Rules  ("the  Rules")  were  set
    out.  It was explained at [32] why paragraph EX.1 has no application to
    H.  To repeat, [32] states as follows:

         "Thus, amongst other things, the appellant would have to show  that
         he meets the 'sole parental  responsibility/living  only  with  the
         appellant as parent' requirement in E-LTRPT.2.3(a), or that  he  is
         not the partner of the person who normally lives  with  the  child,
         namely his wife.  It is for those reasons that paragraph  EX.1  has
         no application to H."

36. So far as EX.1.(b) is concerned,  the  appellant  must  establish  that
    there are insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  with  his
    partner outside the UK.  EX.2 explains what the phrase  "insurmountable
    obstacles" means, again as set out in the earlier decision.

37. It is true that the appellant's wife's account of the  abuse  that  she
    suffered from her husband's family was accepted  by  Immigration  Judge
    Corke when he decided the earlier appeal in December 2005.  That  abuse
    amounted to persecution and included an attempt  to  stage  a  domestic
    accident by electrocution by tampering with her iron, and an attempt to
    harm her by leaving a gas cylinder open.  Further, when  she  moved  to
    Karachi she was assaulted by her brother-in-law and others  in  January
    2004.  However, the evidence both from the appellant and  his  wife  is
    that there has been no contact with any of  their  relatives  for  many
    years.

38. If there was a continuing risk to the appellant's partner  that  would,
    in ordinary circumstances, amount to insurmountable obstacles to  their
    continuing family life.  However, there is no evidence of  any  threats
    made towards her  since  2004  and  there  is  no  contact  with  their
    respective families.  Quite apart from the issue of the ability of  the
    appellant and his wife to live in another part of Pakistan, there is no
    evidence at all that her husband's family, or indeed  her  own  family,
    would even know that they had returned to Pakistan.  This was a  matter
    that was put  to  the  appellant's  wife  during  cross-examination  in
    relation to her own family.

39. Although I  accept  the  background  evidence  that  domestic  violence
    against women in Pakistan continues, and  that  honour  killings  still
    take place, the evidence before me does not reveal a  continuing  risk,
    for the reasons explained above.

40. In terms of their ability to obtain employment, there is no  reason  to
    think that either of them could not find some employment.

41. Although there is evidence  in  earlier  witness  statements  that  the
    appellant's wife suffers  from  hypertension  and  heart  palpitations,
    there is nothing in the most recent witness statements to suggest  that
    she would be unable to return to Pakistan because of difficulties  with
    her  health.   No  medical  evidence  has  been  put  before  me.   The
    conditions which were previously referred  to  are  ones  that  she  is
    likely to be able to receive medical treatment for in Pakistan.

42. Whilst I accept the appellant's wife's evidence that  subjectively  she
    still fears return, for the reasons I have given the evidence does  not
    establish that she would, in fact, be at risk, particularly bearing  in
    mind that she would be returning with her husband.

43. On a self-contained  basis,  therefore,  without  taking  into  account
    separation from H, I am not satisfied  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to the appellant and his wife continuing their family life in
    Pakistan.

44. Even taking into account the issue of separation from H,  as  a  couple
    they would be able to continue their family life notwithstanding that I
    accept that it would plainly affect them very deeply emotionally to  be
    separated from family members in the UK, in particular H in  the  light
    of his condition.  Accordingly,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  paragraph
    EX.1.(b) is met.

45. Next, I consider GEN.3.2 which, materially, provides as follows:

         "GEN.3.2.

          1) Subject to sub-paragraph (4), where an application for entry
             clearance or leave to enter or remain made under this
             Appendix, or an application for leave to remain which has
             otherwise been considered under this Appendix, does not
             otherwise meet the requirements of this Appendix or Part 9 of
             the Rules, the decision-maker must consider whether the
             circumstances in sub-paragraph (2) apply.

          2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above applies, the decision-maker must
             consider, on the basis of the information provided by the
             applicant, whether there are exceptional circumstances which
             would render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or
             remain, a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on
             Human Rights, because such refusal would result in
             unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their
             partner, a relevant child or another family member whose
             Article 8 rights it is evident from that information would be
             affected by a decision to refuse the application."

46. The question, then, is whether refusal of leave to remain would  result
    in a breach of Article 8 because there  are  exceptional  circumstances
    meaning that refusal would result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
    for the appellant, his partner, a  relevant  child  or  another  family
    member whose Article 8 rights would be effective.  Plainly, this is  an
    issue that concerns H rather than any of the  other  children  who  are
    adults.

47. There is obviously H's  learning  disability  to  consider.   It  is  a
    preserved finding of the FtJ that  if  H's  parents  move  to  Pakistan
    without him, this would be a "significant  blow"  to  him.   I  do  not
    accept the submission on behalf of the appellant  to  the  effect  that
    that finding  is  tantamount  to  a  conclusion  that  there  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh consequences. A 'significant blow' is not,  without
    more, synonymous with 'unjustifiably harsh consequences'.

48. I have proceeded on the footing that H would not go  to  Pakistan  with
    his parents and that it would not be reasonable to expect him to do so.
     That conclusion takes into account the very significant factor of  his
    British citizenship, as well as the educational (and  other)  provision
    that he is receiving in the UK which, I accept, is unlikely to be  able
    to  be  precisely  replicated  in  Pakistan,  at  least   not   without
    significant cost which the family would not be  able  to  meet.   Quite
    apart from that, it is likely to be the case that H's socialisation and
    confidence would be affected by a move to an environment which  is  now
    unfamiliar to him, given that he came to the UK at a very young age.

49. I do not consider that the word "unjustifiably" in GEN.3.2.(2) excludes
    consideration  of  matters  beyond  those  affecting   the   individual
    concerned, unlike the "reasonableness" or "unduly harsh" provisions  in
    ss.117B and C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  as
    explained in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2018] UKSC 53.  Accordingly, the fact of the  appellant's  significant
    acts of deception as already outlined, are significant relevant factors
    to take into account in terms of the public interest.

50. However, I do accept, as found by the FtJ, that H's best interests  are
    for him to remain living in the UK with both  his  parents.   That,  of
    course, is not determinative.  Nevertheless, he  plainly  has  a  close
    relationship with both his parents that he depends  on  his  mother  in
    particular, for practical day-to-day support.  He also has a very close
    relationship with the appellant.

51. Whilst H could continue living with his brother, A, in the UK and would
    be likely to receive emotional and practical  support  from  him,  that
    would not in my view replicate the close day-to-day support he receives
    from his mother, and, to a lesser extent, from the appellant.  That  is
    quite apart from the fact that H needs a level of support that A  would
    be unlikely to provide given that he has full-time employment.

52. In those circumstances, I  am  satisfied  that  there  are  exceptional
    circumstances meaning that refusing leave to remain would amount  to  a
    breach of Article 8 because it  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for H.

53. Accordingly, it is not necessary to go on to consider Article 8 outside
    the Rules.

    Decision

54. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision is set aside and the decision  is  re-
    made, allowing the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
