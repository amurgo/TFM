                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms F Aslam, Duncan Moghal Solicitors.
For the Respondent:  Mr C Howells, Home Office Presenting Officer

1. Whilst respect for 'private life' in Art 8 does not include  a  right  to
work or study per se, social ties and relationships  (depending  upon  their
duration and richness) formed during periods of study or work   are  capable
of constituting 'private life' for the purposes of Art 8.

2. In determining a Tier 1 (post-study) worker case where Art  8  is  relied
upon, the 5-stage approach in Razgar should be followed.

3. When determining the issue of proportionality  in  such  cases,  it  will
always be important to evaluate the extent of the individual's  social  ties
and relationships in the UK.  However, a student here on a  temporary  basis
has no expectation of a right to remain in order to further these  ties  and
relationships if the criteria  of  the  points-based  system  are  not  met.
Also, the character  of  an  individual's  'private  life'  relied  upon  is
ordinarily by its very nature of a  type  which  can  be  formed  elsewhere,
albeit through different social ties, after the individual is  removed  from
the UK.  In that respect, 'private life' claims of this kind are  likely  to
advance a less cogent basis for outweighing the public  interest  in  proper
and effective immigration control than are claims based upon  'family  life'
(or  quasi-family  life  such   as   same-sex   relationships)   where   the
relationships are more likely to be unique and  cannot  be  replicated  once
the individual leaves the UK.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe who was born 17 April 1970.   On
    16 February  2009,  the  Respondent  refused  her  application  for  an
    extension of leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant
    under paragraph 245Z of Statement of Changes in Immigration  Rules  (HC
    395).  On 16 April 2009, a panel of the Tribunal (DIJ D N Bowen and  IJ
    Y J Jones) dismissed her appeal.  On 11  May  2009  SIJ  McKee  ordered
    reconsideration.  Thus, the matter came before us.

 2. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom on 24 April 2002 as a student.
     On 1 April 2004, the Appellant's husband and daughter, who was born on
    17 September 1995, joined the Appellant in the UK  as  her  dependents.
    The Appellant's daughter has been in school in the UK since 2003,  when
    she was aged 8.  She is now aged 13 and in secondary school.  In August
    2005, the Appellant's husband died.

 3. Since arriving in 2002, the Appellant has been a student undertaking  a
    number of courses with leave culminating in a BA (Hons) degree in Youth
    and Community Studies at  the  University  of  Wales,  Newport  between
    September 2005 and June 2008.  She was awarded a 2.2 degree in December
    2008.

 4. During her time as  a  student  and  subsequently,  the  Appellant  has
    undertaken both paid and voluntary work.  Since 2006, the Appellant has
    been employed  through  the  charitable  organisation  'Rethink'  as  a
    Community Health Worker (CHW)  for  the  Severnside  Service  in  South
    Gloucestershire for 18.75 hours per week.   She carries  out  voluntary
    work for the Bristol Youth Offending team and has been involved in  the
    activities of her local church, St Matthews in Bristol.   The Appellant
    wishes to continue her work as a CHW on a full-time  basis  if  granted
    leave under the Tier 1 scheme.

      Paragraph 245Z, HC 395

 5. Prior to her leave expiring on 31 January 2009, the  Appellant  applied
    for further leave as a Tier  1  (Post-Study)  Worker.   The  Respondent
    refused her application.  That refusal was on the basis that  a  number
    of the requirements of para 245Z were not met but,  before  the  Panel,
    the Respondent relied only upon para 245Z(e) namely that:

           "The applicant must have a minimum of 10 points  under  Appendix
           C."

 6. Those 10 points were necessary for her  to  succeed  under  the  Points
    Based System (PBS).  Appendix C deals with the  'maintenance'  element.
    Appendix C provides so far as relevant:

           "3. The applicant must have the funds specified in  paragraph  2
           above at the date of the application  and  must  also  have  had
           those funds for a  period  of  time  set  out  in  the  guidance
           specifying the specified documents for the purposes of paragraph
           2 above."

 7. Paragraph 2 of Appendix C, in turn, specifies the amount as �800.   The
    UK Border Agency's Guidance, Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)  of  the  Points
    Based System - Policy Guidance  (in  the  version  applicable  to  this
    appeal) specifies that the �800 of personal (cash) savings must be held
    by the individual for a  three  month  period  prior  to  the  date  of
    application.  The Guidance further specifies (at para 96) the documents
    which are required to  establish  this;  including  a  letter  or  bank
    statements from a UK bank or a  letter  from  a  financial  institution
    regulated by the FSA or, in the case of an overseas account,  a  letter
    from the official regulator of that country confirming the  funds  held
    in the applicant's account.  All documents must be  originals  and  not
    copies (para 93).  The documents (or in the case of UK bank  statements
    the most recent) must be dated no more than one calendar  month  before
    the application.

 8. Before the Panel, the Appellant relied upon sums of money held in three
    UK bank accounts over the relevant  period  of  2  October  2008  to  2
    January 2009 (when the application was made) showing a combined balance
    of �454.32.  That obviously was not sufficient to meet  the  Rules  and
    Guidance.  In addition, she relied upon a letter dated  16  March  2009
    from the FBC Bank Ltd in Zimbabwe which stated that as at that date the
    balance of an account in the Appellant's name was  US  $300.   Finally,
    she relied upon a letter dated 19 March 2009 from  the  Great  Zimbabwe
    Realtors that they were in possession of US $750 between  30  September
    2008 and 31 January 2009 which they held for the Appellant  being  rent
    collected by them in respect of a  property  owned  by  the  Appellant.
    Taken together the Appellant claimed she had at least �800 available to
    her as required.

 9. The Panel concluded that the Appellant's documentation did  not  comply
    with the Guidance.  At para 21, the Panel said this:

           "...we cannot accept the letters from the FBC Bank  Limited  and
           GZR as acceptable evidence of the amount held by  the  appellant
           in Zimbabwe as they were submitted after the  application.   The
           evidence from GZR did not come from a personal bank or  building
           society statement and the evidence from FBC Bank Limited  showed
           a balance on a particular day after the requisite period and did
           not show that the appellant held enough funds for the  requisite
           period.  We therefore find that the appellant  did  not  satisfy
           the maintenance requirement to allow her to remain in the UK  as
           a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant."

10. Before us, Mr Howells on behalf of the Respondent  submitted  that  the
    Panel's approach to the documentary evidence was entirely in line  with
    the Tribunal recent decision of NA & Others (Tier  1  Post-Study  work-
    funds) [2009] UKAIT 00025.  There was no material error of law  in  the
    Panel's decision.  Ms Aslam, for the Appellant, informed  us  that  she
    was instructed to pursue the reconsideration on  this  issue  but  then
    made no specific submissions to us.

11. In our judgment, the Panel's decision was inevitable and  correct.   In
    relation to the letter from FBC Bank Limited we entirely agree with the
    Panel that this document did not in any way assist the  Appellant.   It
    merely states that the Appellant's account at that bank had US $300  in
    it on 16 March 2009.  It says nothing about  what,  if  any,  of  these
    funds were available to her over the relevant three month period  prior
    to her application in  January  2009  as  required  by  the  UK  Border
    Agency's Guidance.

12. By contrast, as the Panel accepted,  the  letter  from  Great  Zimbabwe
    Realtors dated 19 March 2009 did show that she had  US  $750  available
    over the relevant period.  However, they placed no  reliance  upon  it,
    inter alia, because it post-dated the application.  With  respect  that
    is not correct.  As the Tribunal pointed out in NA (at [66]-[67]),  the
    effect of s.85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
    is that the Tribunal may take into account evidence on appeal that  was
    not submitted with the application  (or  indeed  which  post-dates  it)
    providing that the evidence relates to the funds available  during  the
    three month period prior to the application.  That  is  precisely  what
    this letter did.  The Panel was, nevertheless, correct not to take  the
    document into account because it does not fall within the documentation
    required by the Guidance. It relates to an "overseas  account"  (albeit
    not a personal bank account) and there is  no  letter  from  the  "home
    regulator" in Zimbabwe confirming the funds as required by para  96(iv)
    of the Guidance.  The Guidance is  mandatory  and  only  the  specified
    documents will suffice to prove the requisite funds were  held  by  the
    Appellant (NA at [47] and [51]).

13. Consequently, for reasons which differ only slightly from those of  the
    Panel, we agree that the two documents relied upon by the Appellant did
    not fall within the Guidance and thus the Panel were right to  conclude
    that the Appellant had failed to show that she had  �800  available  to
    her in the three months prior to her application.  For  these  reasons,
    the Panel's decision to dismiss the appeal  in  respect  of  para  245Z
    discloses no material error of law and must stand.

14. At the conclusion of the case Mr Howells pointed out  that  the  appeal
    before the Panel  had  proceeded  on  a  false  premise.   Because  the
    Appellant had a dependent child, the amount of cash funds which she had
    to have available was not �800 (as had been the common  ground  between
    the parties) but, in fact, �1333 to reflect an  additional  element  of
    �533 for each dependant).  He referred us to the  UK  Border  Agency's,
    Points Based System (Dependants) - Policy  Guidance  at  para  30.   Ms
    Aslam did not challenge this.   We  are  grateful  to  Mr  Howells  for
    drawing this to our attention.  It is unfortunate that  the  Panel  was
    not referred to the relevant Guidance.  Had  this  been  drawn  to  the
    Panel's attention, it is  clear  that  the  Appellant  could  not  have
    established she had that amount in funds available to her even  if  the
    two documents she relied upon should have been taken into account.  The
    main point at issue in the appeal simply did not arise.

      Article 8

15. In addition to dealing with the Appellant's claim under the Immigration
    Rules, the Panel considered whether the Respondent's decision  breached
    the Article 8 rights of the Appellant and her daughter  (aged  13)  who
    lives with her in the UK.  The latter's rights are  to  be  taken  into
    account following the House of Lords' decision in  Beoku-Betts  v  SSHD
    [2008] UKHL 39.

16. At para 22 of their determination, the Panel concluded that there would
    be no interference with their family life as that could be  resumed  in
    Zimbabwe and, in any event, it was not disproportionate to require  the
    Appellant and her daughter to return to Zimbabwe to resume their family
    life.

17. The Panel's conclusion in respect of the Appellant and  her  daughter's
    family life is, perhaps, not surprising.   Ms Aslam submitted, however,
    that the Panel erred in law in focussing exclusively upon family  life.
    They wholly failed to consider the effect of removal upon the Appellant
    and her daughter's private life in the UK.  That right was both engaged
    and breached in the circumstances of this  case.   In  particular,  she
    submitted that the Appellant's  opportunity  to  gain  post-study  work
    experience and the effect upon her daughter of ending her schooling  in
    the UK if she had to return to Zimbabwe engaged the  right  to  respect
    for the private life of both the Appellant and her daughter.

18. Mr Howells accepted that Article 8 had been raised in  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal  before  the  Panel.   He  also  accepted  that  the  order  for
    reconsideration did not preclude the Appellant from raising this issue.
     He submitted, however, that the  circumstances  did  not  engaged  the
    'private  life'  aspect  of  Article  8  because  there  was,  in   the
    circumstances, insufficient interference with  it  and,  alternatively,
    that any breach was proportionate.

      1. 'Private Life'

19. Article 8 of the ECHR is in the following terms:

           "1.  Everyone  has  the  right  to  respect  for  his  private
           and family life, his home and his correspondence.
           2.  There shall be no interference by a public  authority  with
           the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance  with
           the law  and  is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
           interests of national security, public safety  or  the  economic
           well-being of the country, for the  prevention  of  disorder  or
           crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
           protection of the rights and freedoms of others."

20. The correct approach to applying Art 8 was articulated by Lord  Bingham
    of Cornhill in R(Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 at [17] in the now well-
    known 5-stage test:

           "(1)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a  public
           authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to  respect
           for his private or (as the case may be) family life?
           (2)  If so, will such interference have  consequences  of  such
           gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?
           (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
           (4)  If so, is such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
           society in the interests of national security, public safety  or
           the economic well-being of the country, for  the  prevention  of
           disorder or crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or
           for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
           (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate
           public end sought to be achieved?"

21. In this appeal, there is no issue in  respect  of  (3)  and  (4).   The
    battleground is in relation to whether the decision interferes with the
    Appellant's (and her daughter's) protected right  under  Art  8  (issue
    (1));  whether  that  interference,  if  established,  is  sufficiently
    serious to engage Art 8.1 (issue (2)); and  finally  whether  any  such
    interference  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim   of   proper
    immigration control (issue (5)).

22. The scope of 'private life' and its content has not proved  susceptible
    of precise and comprehensive definition.  In Pretty v  UK  (Application
    no. 2346/02) (2002) 35 EHRR 1,  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights
    offered the following 'broad' description (at [61]):

           " 61. As the Court has had previous  occasion  to  remark,  the
           concept of "private life" is a broad  term  not  susceptible  to
           exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and  psychological
           integrity of a person (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment
           of 26 March 1985, Series  A  no.  91,  p.  11,  � 22).  It  can
           sometimes embrace aspects of an individual's physical and social
           identity (see Mikulic v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, � 53, ECHR 2002-
           I). Elements such as, for example, gender  identification,  name
           and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the  personal
           sphere protected by Article 8 (see, for example, B.  v.  France,
           judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 232-C, pp. 53-54, � 63;
           Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A
           no. 280-B, p. 28, � 24; Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom,  judgment
           of 22 October 1981, Series A  no.  45,  pp.  18-19,  �  41;  and
           Laskey, Jaggard and Brown, cited above, p. 131, � 36). Article 8
           also protects a right to personal development, and the right  to
           establish and develop relationships with other human beings  and
           the outside world (see, for  example,  Burghartz,  cited  above,
           opinion of the Commission, p. 37, � 47, and Friedl v.  Austria,
           judgment of 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of  the
           Commission,  p.  20,  �  45).  Although  no  previous  case  has
           established as such any right  to  self-determination  as  being
           contained in Article 8 of the Convention,  the  Court  considers
           that the notion of personal autonomy is an  important  principle
           underlying the interpretation of its guarantees."

23. In  R(on the application  of  the  Countryside  Alliance)  v  Attorney-
    General and others [2007] UKHL 52, Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill,  having
    described the content of the right as "elusive" and one which "does not
    lend itself to exhaustive definition" characterised the essence of what
    is protected by Art 8 as follows (at [10]):

           "...the purpose of the article is in my view  clear.  It  is  to
           protect the individual against intrusion by agents of the state,
           unless for good reason, into the  private  sphere  within  which
           individuals expect to be left alone to  conduct  their  personal
           affairs and live their personal lives as they choose."

24. The two spheres of impact of the right to respect for private life are,
    therefore, in a sense, on the one hand, the right to keep the world out
    of one's own affairs (right to exclude) and, on  the  other  hand,  the
    right to be let into the world of others (the right  to  be  included).
    Often appeals before the AIT are concerned with the former  right,  for
    example where an individual claims his  physical  and  moral  integrity
    will be affected by the decision as in health or  suicide  cases  (see,
    e.g. Bensaid v UK (Application No 44599/98)  (2001)  33  EHRR  205  and
    R(Razgar) v SSHD).   This appeal is not concerned with that  aspect  of
    an individual's private life but rather with  the  "right  to  personal
    development, and the right to establish and develop relationships  with
    other human beings and the outside world" (Pretty at [61]).

25. Clearly, it  cannot  be  gainsaid  that  individuals  normally  develop
    relationships with others by living and  engaging  in  society  in  the
    country where they live.  It would be a rare and unusual case of social
    isolation for this not to be so.  In Maslov v Austria  (Application  No
    1638/03) [2009] INLR 47 the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR pointed out  (at
    [63]) this potentially  important  aspect  of   'private  life'  within
    Article 8:

           "63. ... as Article 8 also protects the right to  establish  and
           develop relationships with other human beings  and  the  outside
           world and can  sometimes  embrace  aspects  of  an  individual's
           social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social
           ties between settled migrants and the community  in  which  they
           are living constitutes part of the  concept  of  "private  life"
           within the meaning of Article 8. Regardless of the existence  or
           otherwise of a "family life", the expulsion of a settled migrant
           therefore constitutes an interference with his or her  right  to
           respect for private life. It will depend on the circumstances of
           the particular case whether it is appropriate for the  Court  to
           focus on the  "family  life"  rather  than  the  "private  life"
           aspect...."

26. Whilst, of course, the Court had in mind  a  "settled"  immigrant,  the
    point made there is a good one (albeit likely  to  be  that  much  less
    powerful) in the circumstances of an individual with limited leave such
    as the Appellant.

27. In this appeal, however, the  Appellant  puts  her  Art  8  case  in  a
    narrower way.  She argues that Art 8  is  engaged  because  she  has  a
    'right' to gain work experience and her daughter has a 'right'  not  to
    have her education (it is assumed) deleteriously affected by having  to
    return to Zimbabwe  with  her  mother.   As  regards  the  latter,  the
    argument was not put on the basis of a 'right to education' within  Art
    2  of  the  First  Protocol  to  the  Convention.   If  it  had   been,
    establishing a breach of such a right would, in any event, not  survive
    objective  justification   for   a   legitimate   aim   -   in   effect
    'proportionality' - where the legitimate aim of immigration control was
    in play and education in her home country is  available  to  the  child
    (see R(Holub) v SSHD [2001] 1 WLR 1359, CA).

28. There is no doubt that  the  social  ties  and  relationships  actually
    formed in the work place and at school fall within the protected  right
    to personal development accepted in the case  law.   But  what  of  any
    wider right to work (or gain work experience) or study?

29. The ECtHR's case law gives some support to the view that aspects of  an
    individual's working life can fall within Art 8.  In Niemietz v Germany
    (Application No 13710/88) (1993) 16 EHRR 97 the  Court  said  this  (at
    [29]):

           "There appears, furthermore, to be no reason  of  principle  why
           this understanding of the notion of  "private  life"  should  be
           taken to exclude activities of a professional or business nature
           since it is, after all, in the course  of  their  working  lives
           that the majority of people  have  a  significant,  if  not  the
           greatest,  opportunity  of  developing  relationships  with  the
           outside world. This view is supported by the fact that,  as  was
           rightly pointed out by the Commission, it is not always possible
           to distinguish clearly which of an individual's activities  form
           part of his professional or business  life  and  which  do  not.
           Thus, especially in the case of a person  exercising  a  liberal
           profession, his work in that context may form part and parcel of
           his life to such a degree that it becomes impossible to know  in
           what capacity he is acting at a given moment of time."

30. The focus of the Court appears, however, to  be  on  the  relationships
    which are formed during a professional life and the connection  between
    those and any others formed in the day-to-day life  of  an  individual.
    In this sense, it is far from clear that the Court saw professional  or
    working activity itself as falling within the substantive content of an
    individual's 'private life'.

31. The Court came closer to the view which  would  bring  professional  or
    working  activity  per  se  within  Art  8  in  Sidabras  v   Lithuania
    (Application No 55480/00) (2006) 42 EHRR 6.  The  applicants  had  both
    worked for the Lithuanian branch of the KGB.  After  independence,  the
    applicants  worked  for  the  Government  as  a  tax  inspector  and  a
    Government prosecutor.  In 1999, as "former KGB officers"  they  became
    subject to employment restrictions imposed by  Lithuanian  legislation.
    They were both dismissed from their Government  jobs  and  banned  from
    working in the private sector until 2009.  They  claimed,  inter  alia,
    that their ban from finding jobs in the private sector breached  Art  8
    taken in conjunction with Art 14.  By a majority (5-2) the  Court  held
    that the facts fell within the ambit of Art 8 and that there had been a
    violation of Art 14 taken in conjunction with Art 8.  In respect of the
    ambit of Art 8, the majority, having cited Niemietz, said this (at [47]-
    [48]):

           "47...having regard  in  particular  to  the  notions  currently
           prevailing in democratic states, the Court considers that a far-
           reaching ban on taking up private-sector employment does  affect
           "private life"....

           48....Admittedly, the ban has not affected the  possibility  for
           the  applicants  to  pursue  certain   types   of   professional
           activities. The  ban  has,  however,  affected  the  applicants'
           ability to develop relationships with the  outside  world  to  a
           very significant degree, and has  created  serious  difficulties
           for them as regards the possibility to earn their  living,  with
           obvious repercussions on their enjoyment of their private life."

32. At [49]-[50] the Court continued:

           "49 The Court also notes the  applicants'  argument  that  as  a
           result of the publicity caused by the adoption of the "KGB  Act"
           and its application to them, they have been subjected  to  daily
           embarrassment as a result of their past activities.  It  accepts
           that the applicants continue  to  labour  under  the  status  of
           "former KGB officers" and that fact may of itself be  considered
           an impediment to the establishment of contacts with the  outside
           world - be they employment-related or  other  -  and  that  this
           situation undoubtedly affects more than just  their  reputation;
           it also affects the enjoyment of their "private life". The Court
           accepts that Article 8 cannot be invoked in  order  to  complain
           about  a  loss  of  reputation  which  is  the  result  of   the
           foreseeable consequences of  one's  own  actions  such  as,  for
           example, the commission  of  a  criminal  offence.  Furthermore,
           during the considerable period which elapsed between the fall of
           the former Soviet Union (and the ensuing  political  changes  in
           Lithuania) and the entry into force of the impugned  legislation
           in 1999, it can reasonably be supposed that the applicants could
           not have envisaged  the  consequences  which  their  former  KGB
           employment would entail for them. In any event, in  the  instant
           case there is more at stake for the applicants than the  defence
           of their good name. They are marked in the eyes  of  society  on
           account of their past association  with  an  oppressive  regime.
           Hence, and in view of the wide-ranging scope of  the  employment
           restrictions which the applicants  have  to  endure,  the  Court
           considers that the possible damage to  their  leading  a  normal
           personal  life  must  be  taken  to  be  a  relevant  factor  in
           determining whether the facts  complained  of  fall  within  the
           ambit of Article 8 of the Convention.
           50.  Against the above background, the Court considers that the
           impugned ban affected, to a significant degree, the  possibility
           for the applicants to pursue various professional activities and
           that there were consequential effects on the enjoyment of  their
           right to respect for their "private life" within the meaning  of
           Article 8."

33. It is important to  note  that  the  Court  did  not  conclude  that  a
    violation of Art 8 had been established (see [63]).  It did not need to
    consider that as it found a breach of Art 14 read in  conjunction  with
    Art 8.  The Court was only concerned with whether the facts fell within
    the 'ambit' of Art 8.  No issue of interference or, very significantly,
    the  proportionality  of  any  breach  was  considered  by  the  Court.
    Further, the Court was concerned, as it emphasised,  with  an  outright
    ban on employment.  They were not denied the opportunity to engage in a
    particular job or for a particular employer.  They simply had no  place
    to work.  Obviously influential was the 'stigma' and impact  upon  them
    of such a public ban.  The nature  of  the  ban  and  its  considerable
    effect upon the applicants beyond preventing them  working  contributed
    to  the  Court's  decision.   Having  said  that,  at  least  in  these
    circumstances, the Court considered that the ban impacted upon  aspects
    of the applicants' 'private life' under Art 8.

34. It would be premature and unwarranted to read Sidabras as  establishing
    that a right to work (or enjoy work activity) is  entailed  in  Art  8.
    Caution  was  certainly  expressed  by  the  House  of  Lords  in   the
    Countryside  Alliance  case.   There,  the  House  was  considering   a
    challenge to the ban on hunting imposed by the Hunting Act  2004.   One
    of the challenges was based upon Art 8 and one strand of that challenge
    was that the ban interfered with huntsmen's 'private life' in  that  it
    effected a loss of their livelihood.  The House  of  Lords  unanimously
    rejected  this  together  with  the  other  human  rights  and  EU  law
    challenges to the 2004 Act.  Referring to  the  decision  in  Sidabras,
    Lord Bingham of Cornhill took a very particular view of  the  facts  of
    that case.  He said (at [15(4)]):

           "Sidabras was a very  extreme  case  on  its  facts,  since  the
           statutory consequence of employment as KGB officers  some  years
           before was disbarment from employment in very  many  public  and
           private employments, and the applicants complained  of  constant
           embarrassment. Effectively deprived of the ability to work,  the
           applicants' ability to function as social beings  was  blighted.
           Such is not the lot of the [human  rights]  claimants,  to  whom
           every employment is open save that of hunting wild mammals  with
           dogs. But even on the extreme facts of Sidabras  the  court  did
           not, as already noted, find a breach of article 8 but  contented
           itself with finding a breach of  article  14  in  the  ambit  of
           article 8."

35. Given Lord Bingham's exacting  view  of  the  facts  of  Sidabras,  any
    broader generalisation of the ambit of Art 8 would, in our judgment, be
    unjustifiable.  Lord Hope of Craighead also expressed caution about the
    scope of 'private life' protected by Art 8 (at [54]):

           "[This case] is about the  claimants'  right  to  establish  and
           develop relationships with other human beings  and  the  outside
           world. But this right is protected only "to a  certain  degree":
           Niemietz v Germany (1992) 16 EHRR 97, para 29."

36.  The  reference  to  Niemietz  and  its  relevance  to  aspects  of  an
    individual's work falling within Art 8 is perhaps  particularly  worthy
    of note.

37. How then should the threads of the jurisprudence and arguments be drawn
    together?

38. First, in Slivenko v Latvia  (Application No 48321/99) (2004)  39  EHRR
    156, the ECtHR acknowledged (at [95]) that:

           " ...the case-law has consistently treated the expulsion of long-
           term residents under the head of "private life" as well as  that
           of "family life", some importance being attached in this context
           to the degree of social integration  of  the  persons  concerned
           (see, for example, Dalia v.  France,  judgment  of  19  February
           1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 88-89, �� 42-45)."

39. Whilst the ECtHR in Slivenko referred  to  "long-term  residents",  its
    judgment cannot be so restricted.  Those ties may arise -  albeit  with
    less cohesive force -  for  temporary  visitors  such  as  students  or
    workers.  They are an aspect of that  individual's  right  to  personal
    development and the right to establish and develop  relationships  with
    other human beings and the outside world  (Pretty;  Niemietz,  Slivenko
    and Maslov).  As the Tribunal observed in NA (at [105]):

           "....it is possible for a student in the course of  his  or  her
           studies (and part-time working, if applicable) to have developed
           over time ties with the community  that  amount  to  significant
           elements of a private life within the meaning of  Article  8  (a
           student may also have maintained or developed incidental  family
           life ties here)..."

40. Thus, social ties formed whilst living in  a  community,  working  with
    others or studying at  school  or  other  educational  institution  are
    aspects of an individual's 'private life' within Art 8.

41. Secondly, however, that does not lead to the conclusion that a right to
    work or, as it is put in this case on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,  the
    right to gain work experience in itself is embraced by the  concept  of
    'private life' in Art 8.  The  caution  expressed  in  the  Countryside
    Alliance case regarding  the  ECtHR's  decision  in  Sidabras  strongly
    suggests that the Human Rights Court was concerned with  a  case  which
    was "extreme...on its own  facts".   The  impact  of  the  ban  on  the
    applicants involved not only an inability to work in any occupation but
    also resulted in constant public embarrassment.  It may  well  be  that
    the decision more appropriately resides within the category  of  Art  8
    cases dealing with an individual's 'physical and moral integrity'.   In
    our judgment, Sidabras should not, therefore, be taken to establish any
    general proposition that such a right is an aspect  of  'private  life'
    within Art 8.  It would be wrong in cases of this nature to approach an
    appeal on the basis that the denial of leave to  carry  out  post-study
    work engages Art 8 because the right to work or engage in that work  in
    itself falls within the individual's 'private life' protected by Art 8.

42. Thirdly, the same caution should, in  our  judgment,  apply  if  it  is
    suggested that a right to study is itself part of the 'private life' of
    an individual.  We have already noted the specific provision in  Art  2
    of the First Protocol to the ECHR specifically dealing with a 'right to
    education', itself subject to qualification on  objective  grounds  and
    subject to a wide margin of appreciation.

43. We are not aware of any clear authority either European or domestic  on
    this issue.  What case law exists is equivocal.  In OA (Nigeria) v SSHD
    [2008] EWCA Civ 82, the Court of Appeal held that the Tribunal had been
    correct  to  conclude  that  the  claimant  (a  college  student)   had
    established a breach of her Art 8 right to respect for her private life
    if she were removed from the UK in the middle of an academic year.  The
    Court of Appeal does not spell  out  clearly  what  precisely  was  her
    "private life" other than to refer to it as "her studies".  It  may  be
    that the Court had in contemplation the  social  ties  she  had  formed
    whilst studying.  In our judgment the decision should not be  over-read
    in setting the legitimate content of the phrase "private life"  in  Art
    8.  Likewise the Court's decision in favour of  the  claimant  must  be
    seen in the light of the Court of Appeal's subsequent view that it  was
    "on any view an unusual case" as it involved a student who had done her
    best to comply with the Rules but had been misled and  cheated  by  her
    advisors (SSHD v QY (China) [2009] EWCA Civ 680 per Sedley LJ at [25]).

44. More recently in SZ (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 590 the Court  of
    Appeal accepted that the claimant (a student) had established a private
    life in the UK.  That view was based not upon  any  claimed  'right  to
    study' but rather flowed from the claimant's "time and  links"  in  the
    UK.  The claimant had lived here for 6 years during which time she  had
    become part of a church community and had been a student for 4 of those
    years.   Having completed two computer courses, she applied  for  leave
    to undertake a 3 year diploma in  health  studies.   By  the  time  her
    appeal was heard she had instead been enrolled on a diploma  course  in
    psychology.   Despite the claimant's argument that  her  removal  would
    disrupt her education which she said she would be unable to  pursue  in
    Zimbabwe, the Court of Appeal concluded that  on  the  facts  the  only
    conclusion properly open to the  Tribunal  was  that  her  removal  was
    proportionate and no breach of Art 8 had been shown.

45. We should also refer to LL (China) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 617 - a  case
    relied upon by the Respondent  and  said  to  be  antithetical  to  the
    application of Art 8 in a student case.  It was argued that the  effect
    of the AIT dismissing the claimant's appeal against a refusal to  grant
    him leave under the 'long residence' provisions meant that he would  be
    unable to complete his accountancy qualification.  This, it was said on
    his behalf, engaged his Art 8 right to respect for private life.   Laws
    LJ (at [16]) dismissed the argument as lacking any merit.  He said:

           "I would not accede to this ground of appeal. The appellant  has
           on the facts effectively no Article 8 case unless her desire to
           complete the ACCA course of itself provides her with one, but  I
           do not see that Article 8 can fulfil that function, at least on
           the facts of this case."

46. Laws LJ went on to say that the proper course for the claimant in  that
    case was to see further leave as a student.   The  upshot  is,  in  our
    judgment, that the prospects for  bringing  a  'right  to  study'  case
    within Art 8 are bleak.

47. Finally, the effect in appeals such as the present may not turn on  the
    niceties of the ambit of Art 8.  A Tier 1  migrant  applicant  such  as
    this Appellant may not be able to argue that  a  decision  refusing  to
    extend her leave impacts upon her right to work or  gain  further  work
    experience for the 2 years contemplated in such cases by para 245ZA  if
    successful.  Nevertheless she can argue that the decision impacts  upon
    the positive obligation in Art 8 to respect her right to  private  life
    in the sense of maintaining or allowing to flourish her work and  other
    social relationships during that period.  In the case of a Tier 1 post-
    study work applicant that work may well have already begun on  a  part-
    time basis during her period of study.  And, of course, there may  well
    be aspects of her 'family life' which must also be considered.

48. In applying Art 8 in cases of this sort, the approach  to  be  followed
    remains that set out in Razgar.  The starting  point  is  to  determine
    whether and to what extent the individual has established  'family  and
    private life' in the UK in order to engage Art 8 including any 'private
    life' through the social ties and relationships formed  during  periods
    of study and, if it is the case, during any periods of  part-time  work
    whilst a student (Razgar issue (1)).   The duration and richness of the
    social ties will be important factors in  determining  the  extent  (if
    any) of an individual's 'private life' (note Pill LJ's reference in  SZ
    (Zimbabwe) at [22] to the significance of "closer  personal  or  social
    ties" and "close relationships" developed over time).  Thereafter,  the
    questions will  be:  whether  the  Appellant  can  establish  that  the
    decision affects her 'family and private life'  sufficiently  seriously
    to  engage  Art  8  (Razgar  issue  (2));  and,  if  so,  whether  that
    interference is justified (Razgar issues (3)-(5)), but  in  particular,
    we anticipate,  usually  the  principal  issue  will  be  whether  that
    interference  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim   of   proper
    immigration control taking into account, for example, any delay (Razgar
    issue (5)).

49. In this case, we accept that  the  Appellant's  private  life  will  be
    affected by the Respondent's decision in that it will  have  an  impact
    upon the professional and social ties she has established  in  the  UK,
    including those at the work she has already undertaken as  a  Community
    Health Worker and as a volunteer  with  the  Youth  Offending  Team  in
    Bristol.  We do not omit consideration of her broader social ties  with
    the  community  but  apart  from  those  with  her  church  none   were
    specifically drawn to our attention.   There will  be  an  impact  upon
    those professional and social ties if she has to  return  to  Zimbabwe.
    They will cease.   She  will  be  denied  further  enjoyment  of  those
    relationships that she would otherwise continue, or  form,  during  the
    period of leave she would have had for post-study work under the Tier 1
    scheme.  Likewise, we accept that the decision will have an impact upon
    the private life of the Appellant's daughter.  She will cease to  enjoy
    her social ties, in particular (as the case is presented  to  us)  with
    others at her school.

50. To those aspects of the Appellant's Art 8 claim we add, of course,  the
    family life that she maintains with her daughter in the UK.

      2. Interference

51. Turning to the second issue in  Razgar:  will  the  interference  "have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    article 8"?

52. In AG (Eritrea) v SSHD  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  801,  Sedley  LJ  (at  [28])
    reminded us of the correct approach to this issue:

           "...while an interference with private or family  life  must  be
           real if it is to engage art. 8(1), the threshold  of  engagement
           (the "minimum level") is not a specially high one."

53. As we have already made clear, we accept that the social aspects of the
    private life of the Appellant and her daughter  in  the  UK  which  are
    relied upon  in  this  appeal  will  cease  as  a  consequence  of  the
    Respondent's decision.   That  is  the  effect  of  removal.   It  will
    ordinarily be replaced by alternative private life enjoyed in Zimbabwe.
     However, that in our judgment is primarily relevant to  the  issue  of
    the proportionality of removal.  It cannot contradict the effect on the
    extent of interference with the  private  life  of  the  Appellant  and
    daughter in the UK which they currently enjoy and wish to enjoy in  the
    future.   In relation to the family  life  of  the  Appellant  and  her
    daughter, we entirely agree with the conclusion that the Panel  reached
    namely that "they can resume their family life  together  in  Zimbabwe"
    (at para [22]).  It has never been suggested otherwise.  Indeed, it has
    always been the Appellant's case that she will return to Zimbabwe  with
    her daughter after her post-work study.  Thus, the principal  focus  of
    this appeal must be the 'private life' aspect of the individuals' Art 8
    rights.

54.  In  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  we  are  satisfied  that  the
    interference with the private life of the Appellant  and  her  daughter
    crosses the minimum level of severity to engage Art 8.1.  As Sedley  LJ
    commented in AG (Eritrea) (at [28]):

           "Once the article is engaged, the focus moves...to  the  process
           of justification under art. 8(2). It is this which, in all cases
           which engage article 8(1), will determine whether there has been
           a breach of the article."

55. It is not suggested that the Respondent's decision does not  further  a
    legitimate aim, namely proper and effective  immigration  control.   In
    our judgment, the proportionality of that decision is the key issue  in
    this appeal.

      3. Proportionality

56. The facts in this appeal are not in dispute.  They may be gleaned  from
    the bundle of documents submitted on the Appellant's behalf.   We  have
    the Appellant's statement dated 24 March  2009  which  was  before  the
    Panel.  The Appellant also gave oral evidence at the  hearing.   Though
    we cannot strictly take this into account unless we conclude  that  the
    Panel materially erred in law, in fact that evidence together with  the
    Appellant's later statement of 15 July 2009 does not in any significant
    respect go beyond the evidence which was before the Panel.

57. The Appellant came to the UK in 2004 to study.  She has  done  so  ever
    since graduating from University of Wales, Newport at the end  of  2008
    with a degree in Youth and Community Studies.  She has always had leave
    during her time in the UK.  Her daughter (then aged 8) came to  the  UK
    with the Appellant's husband on 1 April 2004.  Her daughter has been in
    school  in  the  UK  since  around  that  time.    Unfortunately,   the
    Appellant's husband  died  in  August  2005.   The  Appellant  and  her
    daughter, who is dependent upon her mother, have lived  together  since
    his death.  The documentation in the bundle attests to  the  fact  that
    the  Appellant's  daughter  is  settled  and  flourishing  at   school.
    Currently she is in year 8 at a secondary school in Bristol.

58. During her studies in the UK, the Appellant  has  undertaken  paid  and
    voluntary work, in particular in respect of the former as  a  Community
    Health Worker in Bristol for whom she works 18.75 hours a week  and  in
    respect of the latter for the Youth Offending Team in Bristol.   It  is
    full-time work as a CHW with her current employer that  she  wishes  to
    pursue under the Tier 1 scheme.  There is no offer of employment before
    the Tribunal but the Appellant said that they  wished  to  employ  her.
    That is supported, albeit in general terms, by the letter from  Rethink
    in the bundle.  We have no difficulty in accepting the sincerity of the
    Appellant and that the employment that she wishes would be forthcoming.

59. As regards the circumstances in Zimbabwe, the  Appellant's  mother  and
    four sisters live there.  She lived close to them before coming to  the
    UK and maintains contact with them.  The Appellant owns a  property  in
    Zimbabwe.  That is the property which is rented out and the income from
    which is collected and managed by Great Zimbabwe Realtors to  which  we
    have already referred earlier in this determination.

60. We have already referred to the Appellant's financial situation and  it
    has never been suggested that she has at any time  sought  to  rely  on
    public funds in the UK.  She told us that she supports herself from her
    work in the UK, rental income from Zimbabwe and some additional support
    from a cousin in the UK.

61. The correct approach to proportionality is set out by Lord  Bingham  in
    Razgar (at [20]):

           "[it] involve the striking of a fair balance between the  rights
           of the individual and the interests of the  community  which  is
           inherent in the whole of the Convention."

62. The "individual" of course includes both the Appellant and her daughter
    (Beoku-Betts v SSHD).  The assessment is necessarily  a  fact-rich  and
    fact-specific exercise.

63. In NA (at [105]) the  Tribunal  identified  the  position  of  students
    seeking to become Tier 1 post-study workers:

           "...[students] are persons who have come to the UK for a limited
           purpose and with no expectation of being able to stay except  by
           meeting the requirements of the Immigration Rules. They  do  not
           thereby acquire  a  right  to  remain  in  the  UK  despite  the
           Immigration Rules. A  refusal  under  the  Tier  1  (Post-Study)
           scheme may mean they fail to make  their  immigration  prospects
           better; it does not mean they have been made worse."

64. We agree with that pertinent observation.   The Tribunal's  observation
    in NA highlights the real difficulty faced by an unsuccessful applicant
    under the Tier 1 Scheme who seeks to establish  that  the  decision  to
    refuse further leave under that Scheme which, in depriving him  of  his
    existing ties and perhaps also the opportunity to  continue  or  obtain
    future work in the UK, amounts to a disproportionate interference  with
    his right to private life under Art 8.

65. The ECtHR has on numerous occasions emphasised the right of a signatory
    country to regulate and control the entry  to  and  residence  of  non-
    nationals in its territory (e.g. Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v UK
    (1985) 7 EHRR 471 at [42]; �ner v The Netherlands [2007] INLR 273  (GC)
    at [54]).  A Tier 1 post-study applicant's presence in the  UK  remains
    "contingent" on complying with the Immigration Rules and Guidance under
    the points based scheme and there can be no expectation of a  right  to
    remain if these are not met.  They lay down rigorous criteria and there
    will always be, as the Tribunal noted in  NA,  "hard  cases  or  'near-
    misses' that fall through the net" (at [103]).   Also, the character of
    an individual's 'private life' relied upon in cases  of  this  sort  is
    ordinarily by its very nature of a type which can be formed  elsewhere,
    albeit through different social ties, after the individual  is  removed
    from the UK.  In that respect, 'private  life'  claims  are  likely  to
    advance a less cogent basis for  outweighing  the  public  interest  in
    proper and effective immigration control than  are  claims  based  upon
    'family life' (or quasi-family life  such  as  same-sex  relationships)
    where the relationships are more likely to  be  unique  and  cannot  be
    replicated once the individual leaves the UK.

66. That said, each case must necessarily depend upon  its  specific  facts
    and it is essential that a judicial decision  is  reached  applying  an
    "even-handed application of the proportionality tests" (WB (Pakistan) v
    SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 215 at [16] per Sedley LJ).  There  can  be  no  a
    priori conclusion or presumption about the outcome based, for  example,
    upon the premise that successful cases will be rare or exceptional  (WB
    (Pakistan) at [16] per Sedley LJ).  What  has  been  described  as  the
    "difficult evaluative exercise" entailed in  the  proportionality  test
    must always be undertaken (EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL  41  at  [12]
    per Lord Bingham of Cornhill).

67. We repeat that the Appellant and her daughter's private  life  in  this
    country (as relied upon before us) will cease if removed.  Their family
    life will of course continue in Zimbabwe and the Appellant's  immediate
    family is there.  So, it is fair to assume, will an alternative private
    life including school for the Appellant's daughter. Ms  Aslam  did  not
    rely upon any adverse  conditions  or  absence  of  schooling  for  the
    Appellant's daughter in Zimbabwe and did not put before us any material
    relating to the situation in Zimbabwe.  We do not understand  that  the
    Panel was in any different position.  As we have said, the  Appellant's
    case was put on the sole basis of what she  (and  her  daughter)  would
    lose, or more perhaps accurately, not gain in the UK if removed.  It is
    the Appellant's position that she  will  return  to  Zimbabwe  but  she
    wishes to postpone that until she has worked under the Tier  1  scheme,
    presumably for the 2 years allowed.  Rather, the  loss  of  the  future
    enjoyment of their private life in the UK was the basis  for  Ms  Aslam
    submitting that the Tribunal should find a breach of Article 8.

68. The Appellant has always been in the UK  on  a  temporary  basis  as  a
    student.  During that time she, and since her  arrival,  her  daughter,
    have developed a private life  through  their  work,  social  ties  and
    school.  At no point has  the  Appellant  (or  her  daughter)  had  any
    expectation of remaining in the UK unless she was able to  comply  with
    the Immigration Rules.  For the reasons we have already seen  she  does
    not. She fails to meet the maintenance element of the Tier 1 scheme  by
    some margin (as it now appears) when her dependent  child  is  factored
    in.  In truth, both can reasonably be expected to  return  to  Zimbabwe
    and continue the lives that they led prior to coming to  the  UK  on  a
    temporary basis as a student (in the case of the  Appellant)  or  as  a
    dependent of a student (in the case of the Appellant's daughter).

69. Taking all these circumstances into account,  and  adopting  an  "even-
    handed application" of the proportionality test, in  our  judgment  the
    legitimate aim of proper immigration control outweighs  the  rights  of
    the Appellant and her daughter to respect for their private life in the
    UK on the basis claimed.

      Conclusion

70. The Panel erred in law by failing  to  consider  both  the  family  and
    private life aspects of the  Appellant's  (and  her  daughter's)  case.
    That error was, in our judgment, material  to  their  decision.   Their
    decision in respect of Art 8 cannot stand.

71. However, for the reasons  we  have  given,  we  substitute  a  decision
    dismissing the appeal under Art 8 as the Appellant has failed to  prove
    on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent's  decision  breaches
    Art 8.

      Decision

72. Thus, for the reasons we have given, the appeal is dismissed in respect
    of the Immigration Rules (namely para 245Z) and Article 8.
