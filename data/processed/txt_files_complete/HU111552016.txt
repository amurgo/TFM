                                     and

                                                                  Respondent


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of the Philippines. She appeals against  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Telford  dated  16  March  2017
    dismissing her appeal against the refusal of leave to remain on Article
    8 grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pooler
    on 17 October 2017 on the grounds that the judge misdirected himself in
    law and failed to take into account material matters.

3.   In the Rule 24 response the Respondent  accepted  that  the  judge  had
    erred in law and that the decision should be set aside and remitted for
    hearing de novo. The Appellant agreed  to  this  course  of  action  by
    letter dated 4 December 2017

4.   I have decided  in  accordance  with  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Practice
    Statements of 25th September 2012 that the decision dated 16 March 2017
    should be set aside and the appeal remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.
    None of the judge's findings are preserved.


                                 DIRECTIONS

(i)  The Tribunal is directed pursuant to section 12(3)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 to reconsider the appeal at  a  hearing
    before a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Telford.

(ii) I direct that the Appellant serve on the Respondent  and  the  Tribunal
    any further evidence and  submissions  at  least  14  days  before  the
    hearing.

(iii)    The matter is listed before a First-tier Tribunal judge at the
    first available date.

(iv) The Applicant to notify the Tribunal by 5 January 2018 if an
    interpreter is required.
