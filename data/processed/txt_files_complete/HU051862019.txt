                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction


      1.  The  appellant  is  a  national  of  Pakistan.  She  appealed  the
         respondent's decision  dated  17th  February  2019  to  refuse  her
         application for entry clearance as a partner.  The  appeal  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") was dismissed by FtT Judge  Parkes  for
         reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 4th November 2019.


      2. The hearing before me on 25th August 2020 took the form of a remote
         hearing using skype for business. The applicant was represented  at
         the  hearing  by  counsel.   Neither  party  objected,  and  I  was
         satisfied that it was in the interests of justice and in accordance
         with the overriding objective to  proceed  with  a  remote  hearing
         because of the present need to take precautions against the  spread
         of Covid-19, and to avoid delay.  I was  satisfied  that  a  remote
         hearing would ensure the matter is dealt with fairly and justly  in
         a way that is proportionate to the  importance  of  the  case,  the
         complexity of the issues that arise, and the anticipated costs  and
         resources of the  parties.   At  the  end  of  the  hearing  I  was
         satisfied that both parties had been able to participate  fully  in
         the proceedings.


Background


      3. The appellant is married Mr Mohammed Shafiq Dad, a British citizen.
           There is a child of the marriage, [A], born on 27th January 2015,
         who is also a British citizen, but who has lived in  Pakistan  with
         his mother, the appellant, since birth.  On 24th January  2019  the
         appellant applied for entry clearance as a partner and it  was  the
         refusal of that application that was  the  subject  of  the  appeal
         before the First-tier Tribunal.


      4. The respondent was satisfied that the application did not fall  for
         refusal on grounds of suitability.  The  respondent  also  accepted
         that the applicant meets the eligibility  relationship  requirement
         set out in paragraphs E-ECP.2.1 to  2.10  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
         immigration rules  and  that  she  meets  the  eligibility  English
         language requirement. The respondent was not however satisfied that
         the appellant has provided evidence which  establishes  that  there
         will be adequate maintenance for the  appellant,  her  partner  and
         their son without recourse to public  funds.  The  respondent  said
         that in order to meet the requirement  of  'adequate  maintenance',
         the appellant would have  to  demonstrate  that  the  family  would
         receive an income  equivalent to that which would be received by  a
         family of equivalent size, in  the  form  of  income  support.  The
         respondent claimed that  the  appellant  would  therefore  need  to
         demonstrate a weekly income of at least �199.20, whereas the income
         received  by  the  appellant's  partner  in  the  form  of   carers
         allowance, universal credit and  from  his  father,  amounts  to  a
         weekly income of �166.00.


    The decision of FtT Judge Parkes


      5. At the hearing of  the  appeal,  the  appellant  claimed  that  the
         correct basis for the calculation was to look at what the appellant
         and her partner would be entitled to by way of income support, as a
         couple.  Their son, who is a British citizen, would be entitled  to
         benefits upon his arrival in the UK as a matter of  right.  If  the
         child were living in the  UK,  the  appellant's  partner  would  be
         entitled to receive both child benefit and child  tax  credit.  The
         entry clearance officer had calculated that the appellant  and  her
         partner as  a  couple,  would  receive  weekly  income  support  of
         �114.85, whereas the appellant's partner has  a  weekly  income  of
         �164.05 and thus they could adequately maintain themselves  in  the
         UK without recourse to public funds.


      6. Judge Parkes rejected the claim  made  by  the  appellant  that  in
         calculating whether the appellant, her partner and their child  are
         able to maintain themselves adequately in the UK  without  recourse
         to public funds, the decision maker incorrectly included the child,
         in the 'income support' calculation.  At paragraphs [12] to [14] of
         his decision, Judge Parkes said:


             "12. From the skeleton argument at paragraph 6 it is submitted
             that the correct basis of the calculation is to look  at  what
             the appellant and sponsor would be entitled to  as  a  couple.
             There is a fallacy in the argument in that the uplift  that  a
             family would gain in benefits would only  be  payable  if  the
             appellant is in the (sic) lawfully. In other words it  becomes
             circular and is to the effect that  the  appellant  should  be
             permitted  to   enter   thereby   increasing   the   sponsor's
             entitlement to benefits. I am not persuaded that  that  is  an
             argument that applies.


             13.  The appellant is not in the same position as their child.
             Also as child benefit would be payable if the  couple's  child
             was in the UK and is not a listed benefit it cannot  be  taken
             into account. As their child is a dependent the  cost  of  his
             maintenance is a matter that the evidence has to show  can  be
             met from the sponsor's allowable benefits.


             14.  Having regard to the wording of paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  and
             3.3 I find that the approach of the ECO to  the  finances  was
             correct. It follows that as matters stand the appellant cannot
             show that the sponsor earns  sufficient  to  support  her  and
             their dependent child adequately without additional records to
             public funds."


      7. Having found that the requirements of the immigration rules  cannot
         be met, Judge Parkes acknowledged that ordinarily it  would  be  in
         the best interests of the child to live with both parents, but that
         often does not happen for many reasons.   At  paragraphs  [16]  and
         [17], Judge Parkes concluded:


             "16. The sponsor's circumstances are  clearly  demanding  with
             his caring responsibilities and lack of support and  from  his
             evidence these  are  issues  that  are  causing  him  distress
             exacerbated by the absence of his wife and child in  Pakistan.
             However the  fact remains that finances are inadequate to meet
             what Parliament has decreed is the minimum level required  and
             it cannot be in the best interests of his child  to  come  and
             live in the UK  in  circumstances  that  would  be  below  the
             minimum  acceptable.  That  would  be  contrary  to  his  best
             interests. There is no evidence that the circumstances of  the
             appellant and child in India (sic) are inadequate."


             17.   Although  the  sponsor's   circumstances   are   clearly
             difficult   and   demand   considerable   sympathy   as    the
             circumstances that the family would be  living  in  would  not
             meet the minimum level required the appellant cannot meet  the
             immigration rules. It also follows that although the sponsor's
             circumstances are difficult they would not permit the entry of
             the appellant and their child as that would be  in  breach  of
             the same minimum requirements and that would  be  contrary  to
             public policy."


    The appeal before me


      8. The appellant claims Judge Parkes failed to engage with  the  claim
         made by the appellant that the status of the appellant's son  as  a
         British citizen is relevant.  It is said the fact that the  sponsor
         would be entitled to receive child benefit and  child  tax  credits
         upon his son's arrival in the UK, is relevant to the calculation of
         income that would be  available  to  the  family.   The  additional
         income that would be available by way of child  benefit  and  child
         tax credits arises from the child's status  as  a  British  citizen
         rather than recourse to public funds.  The  appellant  claims  that
         where the dependent child is a  British  citizen,  the  appropriate
         course is to consider what the  appellant  and  her  partner  would
         receive by way of income support as a couple, and to disregard from
         that calculation, the additional elements  of  the  income  support
         that make provision for dependents and the family premium.  On that
         analysis, the appellant claims Judge Parkes erred in his conclusion
         that the eligibility  financial  requirement  is  not  met  by  the
         appellant.


      9. Alternatively, the appellant claims Judge  Parkes  failed  to  have
         proper regard to the best interests of  the  child  and  has  given
         inadequate reasons for concluding that it is in the best  interests
         of the child to remain in Pakistan separated from his  father.  The
         appellant claims Judge Parkes failed to have adequate regard to the
         child's status as a British citizen who  is  being  prevented  from
         enjoying the benefits associated with that status.   The  appellant
         claims the judge failed to adequately address the Article  8  claim
         outside the immigration rules, and appears  to  conclude  that  the
         decision to refuse entry clearance is proportionate simply  on  the
         basis that the eligibility financial requirement is not met.


     10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by FtT Judge
         O'Keeffe on 16th  April  2020.   The  matter  comes  before  me  to
         determine whether the decision of Judge Parkes  is  vitiated  by  a
         material error of law, and if so, to remake the decision.


     11. Before me, Ms Rutherford submits the dependent child is  a  British
         citizen who is living in Pakistan with his mother.   As  a  British
         citizen, the child is entitled to live in the UK and if he lived in
         the UK with his father, there would be no issue as to  whether  the
         eligibility financial requirement is  met.  The  sponsor  would  be
         entitled to child benefit and child  tax  credit  and  that  income
         would be taken into account in the  calculation  of  the  sponsor's
         income.  The combined income that the sponsor would receive,  would
         be greater than that received by a similar family in  the  form  of
         income support.  Ms Rutherford also submits Judge Parkes has failed
         to properly consider the best interests of the child as  a  primary
         consideration and having found that the financial  requirements  in
         paragraph E-ECP.3.1 are not met, failed to consider  whether  there
         are exceptional circumstances which could render refusal  of  entry
         clearance disproportionate in all the circumstances,  and  thus  in
         breach of Article 8.


     12.  In  reply,  Mrs  Aboni  submits  Judge  Parkes  directed   himself
         appropriately and it was open to him to dismiss the appeal for  the
         reasons  set  out.   Mrs  Aboni  submits  Judge   Parkes   properly
         considered whether the sponsor is able to maintain and  accommodate
         himself, the appellant, and their dependent child adequately in the
         UK without recourse to public funds. She refers to the decision  of
         the Tribunal in KA (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006]  UKAIT
         00065 in which  income  support  was  held  to  be  an  appropriate
         yardstick to assess whether the income available to the sponsor and
         his or her family would be adequate.  Mrs  Aboni  submits  that  in
         calculating what a family would receive by way of  income  support,
         it would be artificial to discount the additional income support to
         which the family would be entitled because  there  is  a  dependent
         child and the entitlement to a 'family premium'. The calculation of
         the income support that the family would receive as set out in  the
         respondent's decision is the basic income that a  family  of  three
         (i.e. two adults and a child) would require, to adequately  support
         themselves.


     13. Mrs Aboni submits Judge Parkes did, albeit  briefly,  consider  the
         best  interests  of  the  child,  and  properly  acknowledged  that
         families cannot always live  together.   Judge  Parkes  effectively
         found that there would be insufficient income to support the family
         adequately without recourse to public funds, and, it cannot  be  in
         the best interests of the child to live with his  parents  together
         in the UK, without sufficient income to support  the  family.   Mrs
         Aboni accepts that  there  is  no  holistic  consideration  of  the
         Article 8 claim outside the  immigration  rules,  and  she  accepts
         Judge Parkes dismissed the appeal because he was not satisfied that
         the eligibility financial requirement is met.


    Discussion


     14. The sponsor is in receipt of carers  allowance  and  the  appellant
         must therefore  provide  evidence  that  her  partner  is  able  to
         maintain and accommodate himself, the appellant and any  dependents
         adequately in the UK, without recourse to public funds.   Paragraph
         6  of  the  Immigration  Rules   provides   that   'adequate'   and
         'adequately';


             "...  in  relation  to   a   maintenance   and   accommodation
             requirement  shall  mean  that,  after  income  tax,  national
             insurance contributions and housing costs have been  deducted,
             there must be available to the family the level of income that
             would be available to them if the family  was  in  receipt  of
             income support."


     15. I reject the claim made by the appellant that the correct  approach
         is to look at what a couple would receive by way of income  support
         by removing from the calculation, the dependent  child,  who  is  a
         British citizen.  A minimum income threshold has been introduced in
         respect of sponsorship under the family migration route set out  in
         Appendix FM of the immigration rules.  A minimum  income  threshold
         of �18,600 currently  applies,  with  additional  amounts  for  any
         dependent children, including a child that is not a British Citizen
         or settled in the UK.  There are some categories within Appendix FM
         where the minimum income threshold does not apply, and instead, the
         applicant needs to demonstrate  that  they  are  able  to  maintain
         themselves and any  dependents  'adequately'  without  recourse  to
         public funds.  Entry clearance as a partner  whose  partner  is  in
         receipt of a 'specified benefit' is one such category.


     16. In  Ahmed  (benefits:  proof  of  receipt;  evidence)  [2013]  UKUT
         84(IAC), the Upper Tribunal  held  inter  alia,  that  it  will  in
         general assist the First-tier Tribunal or,  on  appeal,  the  Upper
         Tribunal if, as part of the submission, a calculation  is  supplied
         which reflects the comparison between the applicant's and sponsor's
         combined projected income if the applicant for entry clearance were
         in the United Kingdom on the one hand and, on the other, the amount
         required to provide the maintenance at a level that can properly be
         called adequate.  The Tribunal held that the  income  received  and
         the projection for the figures which the applicant and sponsor have
         to be able to  find,  should  be  expressed  on  a  consistent  and
         arithmetically accurate basis.


     17. On the authorities,  the  proper  approach  is  for  the  Judge  to
         consider whether the income available for maintenance of the family
         unit is equivalent to the amount  that  would  be  available  to  a
         similar family unit on income support, once they have  dealt  with
         the costs  of  their  accommodation.   To  entirely  disregard  the
         presence of a dependent child, whether  that  child  is  a  British
         citizen or not, would be to disregard a member of the  family  unit
         and give an entirely artificial figure regarding the  yardstick  by
         which the income required for the family to support itself  without
         recourse to public funds, is measured.  If a  family  comprises  of
         two adults and a child, the income they require is not in  any  way
         connected to their immigration status.  In the real-world  context,
         the income the family needs to support itself is quite simply  what
         a family of two adults and a child require, to maintain themselves.
         To calculate  the  income  required  in  the  way  claimed  by  the
         appellant would be to calculate the income needed by the family  to
         establish they can maintain themselves adequately in the UK without
         recourse to public funds entirely artificially, and without  having
         proper regard to all those that form part of the family  unit,  and
         the income that the family unit would need to support itself.   For
         example, if there were three or four dependent children all of whom
         are British citizens, it could not  rationally  be  said  that  the
         presence of those three or four children should be disregarded when
         calculating the income that the family  would  require  to  support
         itself, and the assessment should be undertaken by reference to the
         income required applicant and sponsor themselves.


     18. However, there must be a fact specific assessment of the income and
         in my judgement, Judge Parkes erred  in  his  conclusion  that  the
         child benefit and child  tax  credit  that  the  sponsor  would  be
         entitled to as a result of the presence of the  child  in  the  UK,
         could not be taken into account.


     19. The definition  of  'adequate'  in  this  context  as  set  out  in
         paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules provides that  there  must  be
         available to the family the level of income that would be available
         to them if the family were in receipt of income support.  The  only
         way of assessing the level of income that  would  be  available  to
         them if the family "was  in  receipt  of  income  support",  is  to
         consider the actual financial position on arrival.


     20. Although neither party drew my attention to paragraphs 6A to 6C  of
         the immigration rules I have considered how they apply  to  a  case
         such as this.  According to paragraph 6A, for the purposes  of  the
         rules the appellant is not to be regarded as having (or potentially
         having) recourse to public funds merely because she is (or will be)
         reliant in whole or  in  part  on  public  funds  provided  to  her
         sponsor.  In Ahmed (benefits: proof of receipt; evidence), at  [13]
         and [14], the Upper Tribunal considered paragraphs 6A and 6B of the
         immigration rules and said:


             "13. ... As we read para 6A, it is saying that all that counts
             as recourse to public funds is increased benefit as  a  result
             of P's presence and even that does not count if it  arises  as
             the result of the  matters  referred  to  in  para  6B  (which
             includes joint applications for tax credit of  the  type  with
             which we are concerned, the relevant  regulations  being  made
             under section 42 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 ("TCA"))....


             14.  Para 6B then exempts claims  by  P  (as  opposed  to  P's
             sponsor) to  the  specified  benefits  where  there  is  joint
             entitlement...   In  principle,  where  para  6B  applies,  it
             appears to allow not only the joint claim at the  same  amount
             but, as regards P, a joint claim resulting in a higher  amount
             than would previously have been paid to the sponsor alone..."


     21. Paragraph 6C is concerned with applications from  outside  the  UK.
         The applicant will be regarded as having recourse to  public  funds
         where he/she relies upon the future entitlement to any public funds
         that would be payable to the applicant or their sponsor as a result
         of the applicant's presence in the United Kingdom, including  those
         benefits to which the applicant or sponsor would be entitled  as  a
         result of the applicant's presence in the UK under the  regulations
         referred to in paragraph 6B.


     22. Here, the appellant did not rely upon  any  future  entitlement  to
         public funds that would have been payable to her or her sponsor  as
         a result of the appellant's presence in the United  Kingdom.   What
         the appellant relied upon was the additional income that they would
         receive because of the presence of their son, a British citizen, in
         the UK. In the skeleton  argument  that  was  relied  upon  by  the
         appellant at the hearing of the appeal before the FtT, it was  said
         on behalf of the appellant that:


             "5.  .... If the couple's son was in the UK Mr  Dad  would  be
             entitled to receive both child benefit and child  tax  credit.
             He would receive child benefit of �20.70 per  week  and  child
             tax credit including the family element of �62.94 per week. He
             would  also  be  entitled  to  the  child  element  of  income
             support..."


     23. The sponsor's additional entitlement to the  child  benefit,  child
         tax credit and the child element of income support set out  in  the
         appellant's skeleton argument, would not arise from the appellant's
         presence in the UK, but the presence of the child, who is a British
         citizen and is not in any way subject to immigration  control.  The
         appellant could not therefore be regarded  as  having  recourse  to
         public funds for the purposes of paragraph 6C in  respect  of  that
         income.


     24. In my judgement, the failure to have regard to the actual financial
         position that the family would find itself in upon the  appellant's
         arrival in the UK is sufficient to demonstrate a material error  of
         law in the decision of FtT Judge Parkes such that the decision must
         be set aside.  Although I do not  need  to  address  the  remaining
         ground concerning the assessment of the Article 8 claim outside  of
         the immigration rules, I simply record that it is in  my  judgement
         clear that Judge Parkes failed to have any  proper  regard  to  the
         best interests of the child and to properly address the  Article  8
         claim.


     25. The only ground of appeal available to the appellant was  that  the
         respondent's decision is unlawful under s6 of the Human Rights  Act
         1998. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Agyarko -v- SSHD [2017]
         UKSC 11 confirms that the fact that the immigration rules cannot be
         met, does not absolve decision makers  from  carrying  out  a  full
         merits-based assessment outside the rules under  Article  8,  where
         the ultimate issue is  whether  a  fair  balance  has  been  struck
         between the individual and public interest, giving  due  weight  to
         the provisions of the rules.  That was  plainly  not  the  approach
         adopted by Judge Parkes at paragraphs [15] to [17] of his decision.


     26. In the circumstances I am satisfied the decision of Judge Parkes is
         vitiated by a material error of law and the decision is set aside.


    Re-making


     27. It was common ground between the parties that  if  the  requirement
         that the sponsor is able to maintain and accommodate  himself,  the
         appellant and their dependent child adequately in  the  UK  without
         recourse to public funds  is  met,  the  appeal  would  succeed  on
         Article 8 grounds.


     28. The respondent calculated the sponsor's current income to  be  �166
         per week.  On the figures set  out  in  the  respondent's  decision
         letter, the sponsor's income is in  fact  �164.05  per  week.   The
         appellant claimed before the FtT that in addition to  that  income,
         once the appellant's child is in  the  UK,  the  sponsor  would  be
         entitled to receive child benefit of �20.70 per week, and child tax
         credit including the  family  element  of  �62.94  per  week.    It
         appears that those figures were not challenged before the  FtT  and
         Mrs Aboni did not challenge those figures  before  me.   Once  that
         additional income is included  in  the  "income  calculation",  the
         sponsor would have a total weekly income of �247.00 per week.  That
         must  be  considered  against  the   "income   support   equivalent
         calculation" of  �199.20  set  out  in  the  respondent's  decision
         letter.  Even disregarding any entitlement to child benefit, it  is
         clear that the net weekly income derived by the  sponsor  from  his
         income as it is now, together with what he would receive  once  his
         son is in the UK, following deduction of housing costs, is  greater
         than the level of income support  that  a  UK  resident  family  of
         equivalent size would  be  entitled  to.  It  follows  that  in  my
         judgement  the  appellant  has  established,  on   a   balance   of
         probabilities, that the eligibility financial requirement  set  out
         in paragraph E-ECP.3.1 is met.


     29. Mrs Aboni quite properly accepts that although the  appeal  was  on
         'human rights' grounds, the appellant's ability to demonstrate that
         she met the requirement of the Immigration Rules was very likely to
         be determinative. Although there may be cases where a refusal under
         the rules is found to be wrong, but a human  rights  appeal  should
         nevertheless be dismissed, this in my judgment, is not such a case.




     30. Article 8 is plainly engaged.  I find that the decision  to  refuse
         the appellant leave to remain may have consequences of such gravity
         as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.  I accept that
         the interference is in  accordance  with  the  law,  and  that  the
         interference  is  necessary  to  protect  the  legitimate  aim   of
         immigration control and the economic  well-being  of  the  country.
         The issue in this appeal, as is often  the  case,  is  whether  the
         interference is proportionate to the legitimate public  end  sought
         to be achieved.


     31. I have found that the appellant  meets  the  eligibility  financial
         requirements for entry clearance as a partner.  I have  had  regard
         to the public interest considerations  set  out  in  s117B  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  As set  out  by  the
         Court of Appeal in TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ  1109,  compliance
         with the immigrations rule would usually mean that there is nothing
         on the Secretary of State's side of the scales  to  show  that  the
         refusal of entry clearance could be justified. At  paragraphs  [32]
         to [34], the Senior President of Tribunals confirmed that  where  a
         person meets the  rules,  the  human  rights  appeal  must  succeed
         because 'considerable weight' must be  given  to  the  respondent's
         policy as set out in the rules.


     32. Having regard to the policy of the respondent as expressed  in  the
         immigration rules, and in the absence of any countervailing factors
         in the public interest that  weigh  against  the  appellant,  I  am
         satisfied that on the facts here, the decision to refuse  leave  to
         enter is disproportionate to  the  legitimate  aim  of  immigration
         control.  In the circumstances I allow  the  appeal  on  Article  8
         grounds.





Notice of Decision


33. The appeal is allowed and the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Parkes is set aside.


34. I remake the decision and allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.


       V. Mandalia                                 Date   28th August 2020
             Upper Tribunal Judge Mandalia




FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal on the basis of the facts as they are  as  at  the
date  of  my  decision.   Whether  an  appellant  is  able  to  satisfy  the
respondent and on appeal, the  Tribunal,  that  they  meet  the  eligibility
financial requirement is a fact sensitive task.   Although  I  have  allowed
the appeal, I have rejected  the  appellant's  claim  that  the  calculation
should have been undertaken in the way advanced by  the  appellant.  In  all
the circumstances,  I  decline  to  make  a  fee  award  in  favour  of  the
appellant.
