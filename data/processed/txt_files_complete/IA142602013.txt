                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Bangladesh born 29th April 1988  who
    appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Lloyd-Smith promulgated on 25th November 2013.

 2. The Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 8th October 2009 with leave
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student valid between 1st September 2009 and 29th
    February 2012.

 3. The Appellant applied for further leave to remain.  He had to vary  his
    application because the college to which he applied was suspended  from
    the Respondent's list of approved Sponsors and eventually removed.

 4. The Appellant varied his  application  on  28th  March  2013,  and  his
    application was refused on 18th April 2013. The decision to  refuse  to
    vary leave was  made  with  reference  to  paragraph  245ZX(d)  of  the
    Immigration Rules on maintenance grounds. The Respondent contended that
    the Appellant needed to show that he had available funds of �1,600  for
    a consecutive 28 day period ending no earlier than 31 days  before  the
    date of application.  The Respondent found  that  the  bank  statements
    submitted with the application were not from a  bank  on  the  list  of
    acceptable  financial  institutions  listed  at  Appendix  P   of   the
    Immigration Rules, and  in  addition  the  closing  date  of  the  bank
    statements was 17th September 2012, which was more than 31  days  prior
    to the varied application.

 5. The appeal was heard by Judge Lloyd-Smith (the judge) on 19th  November
    2013.  The judge found that the Appellant had not discharged the burden
    of proof essentially for the reasons given by  the  Respondent  in  the
    decision dated 18th  April  2013.   The  judge  did  not  consider  the
    Appellant's appeal under Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  on
    Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 6. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which  was  granted  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  P  J   M
    Hollingworth in the following terms;

         "The judge did not consider Article 8.  Plainly  the  education  of
         the Appellant forms a significant aspect of his private life.   The
         evidential flexibility policy has not been considered fully in  the
         light of the sequence of  material  adduced  by  the  Appellant  in
         relation to the criteria of the policy.  There are arguable  errors
         of law."

 7. Following the grant of permission to appeal there was a hearing  before
    me on 19th June 2014.  I decided that the judge had not erred in law in
    relation to paragraph 245ZX, the judge had correctly  found  that  bank
    statements submitted with the application for leave to remain were  not
    from an acceptable institution, and did not satisfy paragraph 1A(h)  of
    Appendix C because the closing date on the  bank  statements  was  more
    than 31 days before the  date  of  application.   The  judge  had  been
    correct to find that further bank statements submitted after  the  date
    of refusal, should not be taken into account by the  Tribunal  pursuant
    to section 85A(3) and (4) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002.

 8. I did however find that the judge had erred in not considering  Article
    8 which had been raised as a ground of  appeal  and  should  have  been
    determined.  Full reasons  for  my  conclusions  are  contained  in  my
    decision dated 20th June 2014 and promulgated on 26th June 2014.

 9. At the hearing on 19th June 2014 I preserved the findings of the  judge
    in relation to paragraph 245ZX but decided that the decision needed  to
    be remade in relation to Article 8.  It was my intention to go  on  and
    remake the decision, but the Appellant's representative applied for  an
    adjournment on the grounds that he was not ready to  proceed,  although
    he acknowledged that directions had been issued, that if  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside the Upper Tribunal may wish to
    remake the decision at the initial hearing.

10. In the  interests  of  fairness  I  granted  an  adjournment.   It  was
    indicated that the Appellant wished to call witnesses  to  support  his
    Article 8 claim.  Directions were made that any person who intended  to
    give evidence must prepare and sign  a  witness  statement,  and  those
    statements and any other documentary evidence to be relied  upon  which
    had not already been served, must be served upon the Respondent and the
    Tribunal no later than 4pm on 3rd July 2014.

Remaking the Decision - The Upper Tribunal Hearing 17th September 2014

Preliminary Issues

11. Mr Timson who had not previously represented the  Appellant,  indicated
    that he wished to argue that the First-tier Tribunal had made an  error
    of law in refusing the application under  paragraph  245ZX  and  stated
    that it had been conceded by his instructing solicitor at the  previous
    hearing that the judge  had  not  erred  in  law  in  relation  to  the
    Immigration Rules, but that concession had been made in error.

12. I observed that witness statements and further documentary evidence had
    been sent by fax by the Appellant's solicitors at 13.53 hours  on  16th
    September  2014,  despite  directions  having  been  made  that   those
    statements and any documentary evidence should have been  sent  by  3rd
    July 2014.  I observed that of the 28 pages  submitted,  the  first  16
    pages were taken up with witness statements and evidence of the persons
    making those statements together with photographs.  Also  contained  in
    the bundle, without adequate  explanation,  was  a  copy  of  a  letter
    written by the Appellant's solicitors to a First-tier Judge on  another
    case, some undated and unsourced notes on the points-based  system,  an
    article dated 23rd June 2010  referring  to  the  decision  in  Pankina
    [2010] EWCA Civ 719,  and  a  First-tier  Tribunal  determination  that
    related to another appeal, that apparently had been  submitted  without
    any consideration of Practice Direction 11 which deals with citation of
    unreported determinations.

13. Mr Timson could  not  explain  without  taking  instructions,  why  the
    statements and documents had been submitted so late and it was apparent
    that some of the documents had been submitted to reargue the  issue  as
    to whether the judge had erred in law in dismissing  the  appeal  under
    paragraph 245ZX.

14. Ms Johnson objected to submission of all documents,  even  the  witness
    statements, on the basis that they had not been  served  in  accordance
    with  directions.    She   specifically   objected   to   any   further
    consideration of paragraph 245ZX as no notice of this had been given.

15. I decided that the question of whether the judge had erred  in  law  in
    dismissing the appeal under paragraph 245ZX had been considered in  the
    hearing before me on 19th November 2013 and a decision  had  been  made
    that there was no error of law.   If  the  Appellant's  representatives
    believe this is wrong, then they can apply  for  permission  to  appeal
    once this determination has been promulgated.  I decided  that  it  was
    not appropriate to consider paragraph 245ZX, but that the hearing would
    proceed, as indicated in my written decision, on the basis that Article
    8 needed to be considered.

16. I  saw  no  reason  to  refuse  to  admit  into  evidence  the  witness
    statements, nor the photographs, and therefore  of  the  bundle  of  28
    pages that had been  submitted  on  16th  September,  I  admitted  into
    evidence pages 1-16.

Evidence

17. The Appellant gave evidence adopting his witness statement  dated  19th
    November 2013.  I also heard  evidence  from  Cheryl  Finney,  Mohammed
    Moshin and Md Imranul Islam who all adopted  their  witness  statements
    dated 17th September 2014.

18. I have recorded all questions and answers asked of  the  Appellant  and
    witnesses in my Record of Proceedings and it is not necessary to repeat
    them in full here.  The evidence may be summarised as follows.

19. The Appellant initially paid Mancunia College �3,000  but  the  college
    was suspended and eventually  removed  from  the  Respondent's  Sponsor
    list.  He looked for  an  alternative  college  and  approached  Darwin
    College and paid �3,500 and completed a course  but  was  not  provided
    with any certificates as the college claimed that  the  Appellant  owed
    them money which he disputed.

20. The Appellant wishes to complete his education in the  United  Kingdom.
    He has been the victim of  a  crime  in  this  country  for  which  his
    attacker received a prison sentence of 43 months.  The Appellant  feels
    that he cannot return to Bangladesh without a degree.

21. He is not at a college at present but is managing a pizza shop although
    he only works on a  part-time  basis.   In  addition  to  his  wage  he
    receives financial support from his father.

The Respondent's Submissions

22. Reliance was placed upon the refusal decision dated  18th  April  2013.
    Ms Johnson submitted that the Immigration Rules are a complete code and
    the Appellant accepted that he could not meet those  requirements,  and
    there were no compelling circumstances to justify considering Article 8
    outside the Rules and the appeal should therefore be dismissed.

23. If Article 8 was considered outside the Rules then section 117  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the  2002  Act)  must  be
    taken into account.  The Appellant does not rely on family  life.   The
    removal  of  the  Appellant  from   the   United   Kingdom   would   be
    proportionate.  He is being supported by his family, and gave  evidence
    that his siblings in Bangladesh are being educated  at  university  and
    supported by his family and the Appellant could return to his family in
    Bangladesh and either  find  employment,  or  if  he  wished,  make  an
    application to return to the United  Kingdom  to  study,  if  he  could
    satisfy the Immigration Rules.

24. Ms Johnson stated that she relied upon CDS  Brazil  [2010]  UKUT  00305
    (IAC), and Nasim and Others [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) although I was  not
    directed to any particular paragraph of those decisions.

The Appellant's Submissions

25. Mr Timson contended  that  the  Appellant's  application  did  in  fact
    satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  stated  that  his   instructing
    solicitor should not have made a concession that the  Rules  could  not
    have been met.

26. I was asked to extend sympathy to the Appellant who had been the victim
    of violent crime in this country, and has spent a considerable  sum  of
    money on his education without anything to  show  for  it.   Mr  Timson
    submitted that the Appellant's evidence was that he would be seen as  a
    failure if he returned to Bangladesh without completing his education.

27. Mr  Timson  contended  that  there  were  compelling  circumstances  to
    consider Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules,  which  he  accepted
    could not be satisfied.

28. I was asked to take into account that the Appellant  had  been  in  the
    United Kingdom for some years, and that three witnesses had  taken  the
    trouble to attend the hearing and give evidence  in  his  support.   Mr
    Timson contended that the Appellant had fallen foul  of  an  incredibly
    complicated immigration system, and I was asked to note that he did not
    wish to settle in the United Kingdom.  His evidence was that he  wished
    to complete his education and return to Bangladesh.   I  was  asked  to
    find it appropriate for limited leave to be granted to the Appellant so
    that he could complete his studies, and I was asked to allow the appeal
    with reference to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

29. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

30. The Appellant has been resident in the United Kingdom since 8th October
    2009, a period of almost five years.  His initial leave was valid until
    29th February 2012, and it is not disputed that he applied for leave to
    remain before his leave expired.

31. I accept that the Appellant has encountered difficulties with  colleges
    to  which  he  had  applied,  being  removed  from   the   Respondent's
    sponsorship register.  The Appellant has completed a  course  while  in
    the United Kingdom, that being  at  Darwin's  College,  Manchester  who
    confirmed in the letter dated 15th February 2012 that the Appellant had
    completed an Advanced Diploma in  Business  Studies  on  11th  February
    2012, and his attendance was described as satisfactory.  The  Appellant
    was described as a keen and diligent student who strives to achieve the
    best he can in his studies.

32. The Appellant could not satisfy paragraph 245ZX(d) on  the  grounds  of
    maintenance.  He does not rely upon family life, and therefore Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules is not relevant.

33. The Appellant seeks to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of his
    private life.  He accepts, and I find as a fact that he cannot  satisfy
    the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules,  which
    paragraph sets out the requirements to be met by an applicant for leave
    to remain on the grounds of private life.  The  Appellant  cannot  meet
    this paragraph because he had not  lived  continuously  in  the  United
    Kingdom for at least twenty years, and he still has ties to Bangladesh,
    which he accepts.  Having decided that  the  Appellant  cannot  succeed
    under paragraph 276ADE, I have to consider whether it is appropriate to
    consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

34. The Court of Appeal in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA  Civ  558  indicated  in
    paragraph 44 that "at  least  in  this  court,  in  the  light  of  the
    authorities, it is necessary to find compelling circumstances for going
    outside the Rules."  In my view the case law indicates that  where  the
    provisions in the Immigration Rules permit consideration of exceptional
    circumstances and other factors, then those Rules can  be  regarded  as
    being a complete code and there will usually be  no  need  to  consider
    Article 8 directly.  This is because the same outcome would derive from
    the application of the Immigration Rules as under Article 8.  Where the
    Immigration Rules contain no such  provisions,  then  they  are  not  a
    complete code and Article 8 will need to be considered directly.

35. I set out below paragraph 135 of MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 which
    in my view confirms this position;

    135. Where the relevant group of IRs (Immigration  Rules),  upon  their
         proper construction, provide a complete code  for  dealing  with  a
         person's Convention rights in the context of  a  particular  IR  or
         statutory provision, such as in the case of foreign criminals, then
         the balancing exercise and the way the various factors  are  to  be
         taken into account in an individual case must be done in accordance
         with that code, although references to exceptional circumstances in
         the code will nonetheless entail a proportionality  exercise.   But
         if the relevant group of IRs is not such a complete code  then  the
         proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by  the
         Huang tests and the UK and Strasbourg case law.

    As this is not a case where a proportionality test is carried out under
    the Immigration Rules, I find that it is appropriate to conduct such  a
    test outside the Rules.  This  involves  following  the  step  by  step
    approach advocated by the House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 which
    involves answering the following questions;


    (i)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority
         with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
         private or (as the case may be) family life?


    (ii) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?


    (iii)    If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


    (iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society  in
         the interests of national security, public safety or  the  economic
         well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
         for the protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of
         the rights and freedoms of others?


     (v) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate public
         end sought to be achieved?

36. I conclude that the Appellant has established a private life since  his
    arrival in the United Kingdom.  The threshold for engagement of Article
    8 is not especially high, and I therefore conclude that  Article  8  is
    engaged on the basis of the Appellant's private life.

37. The proposed interference with that private life,  by  the  Appellant's
    removal from the United Kingdom, would be in accordance with  the  law,
    because the Appellant cannot satisfy the Immigration Rules in  relation
    to remaining in the United Kingdom.

38.  I  then  have  to  consider  whether  interference  is  necessary  and
    proportionate.

39. I take into account section 117B of the 2002  Act,  which  in  summary,
    states that the maintenance of effective immigration control is in  the
    public interest.  It is also in the public interest that a  person  who
    seeks to remain in the United Kingdom is able to speak English  and  is
    financially independent.  Little weight should be given  to  a  private
    life established when a person is in the United Kingdom  unlawfully  or
    when his immigration status is precarious.

40. In considering the case law referred to by Ms Johnson, CDS  Brazil,  in
    summary, indicates that a judge does not have a freestanding liberty to
    depart from the Immigration Rules, and it is  unlikely  that  a  person
    would be able to show an Article  8  right  by  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom for temporary purposes.  However if admitted as a student,  and
    the course is not finished, that individual may have built up a private
    life deserving of respect, and the public interest  in  removal  before
    the end of the course may be reduced where  ample  financial  resources
    are available.

41. In this case it was not demonstrated  that  ample  financial  resources
    were available.  That is why the  application  was  refused  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Appellant accepts that he had  a  dispute  with
    the college over unpaid fees.  In CDS Brazil, the Appellant had  almost
    completed a course, whereas in this case the Appellant had not  started
    the course for which he was applying for leave to remain.

42. The decision in Nasim at paragraph 15  refers  to  MM  Zimbabwe  [2009]
    UKAIT 00037.  In summary, the head note  to  MM  indicates  that  while
    respect for private life under Article 8 does not include  a  right  to
    work or study per se,  social  ties  and  relationships  formed  during
    periods of study or work are capable of constituting private life,  but
    a student in this county on a temporary basis has no expectation  of  a
    right to remain in order to further these ties and relationships if the
    criteria of the points-based system are not met.

43. The Supreme Court in Patel and Others  [2013]  UKSC  72  gives  further
    guidance on this issue in paragraph 57 which I set out below;

    57.  It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power.  It is to be distinguished from the Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right.  The merits of
         a decision not to depart from  the  rules  are  not  reviewable  on
         appeal: section 86(6).  One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in
         Pankina for common  sense  in  the  application  of  the  Rules  to
         graduates who have been studying in the  UK  for  some  years  (see
         paragraph 47  above).   However,  such  considerations  do  not  by
         themselves provide Grounds of Appeal  under  Article  8,  which  is
         concerned with private or family life, not education as such.   The
         opportunity for a promising student to complete his course in  this
         country, however desirable in general terms, is  not  in  itself  a
         right protected under Article 8.

44. I appreciate that the Appellant wishes to remain in the United  Kingdom
    to further his education.  I accept that he  has  been  unfortunate  in
    relation to colleges losing their sponsorship licences.  I also  accept
    that he is working part-time and I have taken into account the evidence
    of the three witnesses who gave evidence before me.  However I have  to
    attach great weight to the fact that the Appellant cannot  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules.  I attach greater weight to the need to  maintain  a
    firm, fair  and  effective  immigration  control,  than  I  do  to  the
    Appellant's wish to remain in the United Kingdom.  This is not  a  case
    where the Immigration Rules should be disregarded.

45. Because the Immigration Rules cannot be satisfied, I conclude that  the
    decision of the Respondent to refuse to vary the Appellant's  leave  to
    remain is not disproportionate, and does not breach Article  8  of  the
    1950 Convention.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration  Rules  and  on  human  rights
grounds.











Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier  Tribunal  and  there  has
been no request for  anonymity.   The  Upper  Tribunal  makes  no  anonymity
order.
