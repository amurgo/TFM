Representation:

For the appellant:     Miss C Record, counsel  instructed  by  David  A
                       Grand (non-practising barrister, with authority)
For the respondent:          Mr A Hutton

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by a citizen of Vietnam against  the  decision  of  an
   adjudicator, Mr J G Peart, sitting at Taylor House on 12  December  2003
   dismissing his appeal on asylum  and  human  rights  grounds.  The  only
   ground on which permission to appeal was given refers to the appellant's
   suffering from AIDS.  The vice-president who did so said:

   It is arguable that the humanitarian appeal of the case is  so  powerful
   that it cannot be resisted by authorities of a civilised state.


   That is a reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in  N  [2003]
   EWCA Civ 1369, paragraph 40.  This  principle  was  recently  upheld  in
   specific terms by the House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27:  see  the
   speech of Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe at paragraph 31.

2. We are concerned with the principles involved in decided  cases,  rather
   than the minute comparison of facts between them; but each of  them  has
   to be looked at against its own factual background.  We  recognise  that
   there is an extreme case principle, represented by the decision  of  the
   European Court of Human Rights in D v. United  Kingdom  [1997]  24  EHRR
   423, related by the Court of Appeal in N  at  paragraph  18.   D  was  a
   sufferer in the terminal stages of AIDS,  whose  life  was  said  to  be
   drawing to its close.  He faced return to the small island of St  Kitts,
   where there was nothing to show that  he  would  receive  any  moral  or
   social support.

3. Turning to the facts of N; from the medical report reviewed at paragraph
   3, it appears that  she  was  suffering  from  full-blown  AIDS,  in  an
   extremely advanced state, and her life expectancy was under  12  months.
   The figure given by Dyson LJ at paragraph 48 is one of two years; it  is
   not clear where that came from, but we accept that may have been so.  As
   Dyson LJ pointed out, there are many  cases  of  this  kind,  where  the
   subject's life expectancy would be substantially reduced  on  return  to
   their home country.  The facts relating to N's situation on  return  are
   set out by Laws LJ at paragraph 10.    It does not appear that she would
   have any relations on whom she could depend.  She came  from  the  small
   town of Masaka, where the hospital could not treat AIDS at all.

4. This appellant, said to have been a street child, is now 19 and  has  no
   one in Vietnam on whom he could depend.  So  far  as  his  prognosis  is
   concerned, it is set out in a report by an HIV consultant,  Dr  Schwenk,
   of 6 July 2004:

   In conclusion we have achieved quite a good control of his  HIV  disease
   although he presented  with  end  stage  AIDS.   Without  treatment  his
   prognosis would be counted in  a  few  months.   More  specifically  the
   probability to survive for three years  without  further  AIDS  defining
   illness would be in  the  order  of  5%.   By  contrast  anti-retroviral
   treatment has  brought  his  three  year  probability  of  disease  free
   survival to greater than 95%.   This success would be lost  within  some
   weeks if he were forced to stop anti-retroviral treatment.


   There is some question as to what Dr Schwenk could  have  meant  by  his
   references to "family" in the second page of his report.  Clearly on the
   appellant's case he had none in Vietnam, although he does have a  friend
   in this country who is said to be the "family" referred to in  the  last
   paragraph.


5. So far as the medical situation on return is concerned we have in  front
   of us a press release from the BBC Vietnamese Service of 18 April  2003,
   referring to the Binh Trieu centre in Ho Chi Minh City.   This  is  said
   to be the only care centre for AIDS patients in Vietnam.   Ho  Chi  Minh
   City, better known under is former name of Saigon, is the second city in
   Vietnam; and Mr Hutton has  assured  us  that  the  appellant  could  be
   returned directly there, if it came to that.   The nature  of  the  care
   provided at Binh Trieu is well described by the Director  Mr  Nguyen  in
   the following terms:

   What we do here is to give a patient some moral  support  so  that  they
   could become a little calmer,  more  optimistic  and  therefore  prolong
   their lives.


   There is no actual treatment of AIDS, except for members  of  staff  who
   have become accidentally infected; but the hospital  does  provide  some
   treatment for accompanying  illnesses  such  as  tuberculosis  and  skin
   diseases.

6. The question for us is this: is this a case where removal could  not  in
   reason be insisted on by the authorities of a civilised state?  Like all
   such cases, of which as we are reminded by Dyson LJ there are many, this
   is a hard one; but so was that of N.   Contrary to the position in  that
   case, there is at least one dedicated centre  available  on  return  for
   this appellant, where palliative treatment can be had, if no  more.   He
   does have some chance of survival in the medium  term,  as  D  did  not.
   In our view there is no substantial  basis  on  which  we  are  able  to
   distinguish the decision in N, and we have to answer the question before
   us in the negative.  It follows that this appeal is dismissed.
                                                                       [pic]
