For the Appellant:     Mr Pipe, Counsel instructed by Duhra Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Cameroon born in 1970.   He appeals with
    permission against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  A
    Siddiqi) to dismiss his appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse him protection.
    Anonymity Order

 2. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. For the purpose of this appeal the facts can be shortly stated.


 4. The Appellant has been in the United Kingdom since November  2002  when
    he was given leave to enter as a student.   He has been  an  overstayer
    since 2007. He claimed asylum in February 2019. The basis of the  claim
    is that the  Appellant  has  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in
    Cameroon for reasons of his political opinion. He claims that he is  an
    Anglophone  who  has  been  accused  by  the  Francophone   Cameroonian
    government of being a member of the Ambazonia Defence Forces (ADF), and
    that a warrant was issued for his arrest in 2013.

 5. The Respondent rejected this  account  for  want  of  credibility,  and
    although its reasoning was slightly different, the First-tier  Tribunal
    did too.   In broad summary the Tribunal drew  adverse  inference  from
    the very late claim for protection; the Appellant's assertion  that  he
    is Anglophone was contradicted by the  background  material  indicating
    that his home state in Cameroon is in fact French-speaking, and he  was
    himself unable to participate in the hearing  without  an  interpreter;
    the chronology given was internally inconsistent; his  account  of  his
    father's political  activities  was  vague;  the  claim  to  have  been
    convicted  in  absentia  was  unsupported  not  only  by  a   lack   of
    corroborative documentation but by an  absence  of  country  background
    material  showing  such  prosecutions  to  be  pursued;   the   claimed
    conviction had occurred 11 years after the Appellant had left Cameroon.
      Although certain elements of the  account  had  remained  consistent,
    this was not enough to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  given  these
    difficulties.

 6. A second limb of the Appellant's  account  was  that  in  recent  years
    (since approximately  2018)  he  has  become  involved  in  Cameroonian
    politics in the United Kingdom. He claims to have attended a number  of
    events organised by 'West Cameroon Movement for  Change  UK'  and  'BAS
    UK'. He asserts that this sur place  activity  in  the  United  Kingdom
    would place him at risk were he to return to  Cameroon.   The  Tribunal
    appeared to accept that the Appellant had  attended  some  events,  but
    found his commitment to be in bad faith.  The Tribunal did  not  accept
    that the Appellant was genuinely committed to Anglophone separatism  so
    there was no risk of him carrying  on  such  activity  upon  return  to
    Cameroon.  Nor was there any evidence capable of demonstrating that the
    Cameroonian authorities carry out surveillance of the  diaspora:  there
    was therefore no risk resulting from the activities here.  The Tribunal
    went on to consider, in the alternative, whether a risk would arise  if
    there was such monitoring, but given that the  Appellant  was  involved
    with a small group and his claimed activity appeared to be confined  to
    "mobilising Cameroonians in Wigan", the Tribunal was not satisfied that
    the Cameroonian authorities would be interested in him.  The appeal was
    accordingly dismissed.


    The Appeal


 7. The first ground concerns the Tribunal's recording, at  its  �13,  that
    the  Appellant  gave  evidence  using  a  French  interpreter.      The
    relevance of this was that his claim is based on his alleged  political
    support for Anglophone separatism.  The Appellant disputes that he gave
    evidence in French: he states that in fact he gave evidence in English.
     That the Tribunal had plainly drawn adverse inference from its finding
    to the contrary was an error of fact amounting to an error of law.  For
    the Secretary of State McVeety accepted this ground was made  out.  The
    HOPO's note, and the Record  of  Proceedings,  both  confirm  as  much.
    Whether this error of fact is material to the extent that  I  must  set
    the decision aside is a matter I must consider in the  round  with  the
    remaining issues before me:  ML (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 844.


 8. The central  ground  concerns  the  Tribunal's  treatment  of  evidence
    relating to the Appellant's mental health.  At  its  �14  the  Tribunal
    recorded  evidence  before  it  which  indicated  that  it   would   be
    appropriate  to  treat  the  Appellant  as  a  vulnerable  witness   in
    accordance with the First-tier and Upper  Tribunal  Practice  Direction
    Child Vulnerable Adult and Sensitive Witnesses and the decision of  the
    Court of Appeal in AM (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department & Lord Chancellor [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1123.   It  is  perhaps
    evident from  this  that  the  Tribunal  certainly  accepted  that  the
    Appellant does have mental health problems: see further its  �48.   The
    Appellant takes no issue with any of that.   Where he does submit  that
    the Tribunal erred is in the following respects: first in its  decision
    to place only a "little weight" on the medical evidence  provided,  and
    second to fail to factor in the Appellant's mental health problems when
    assessing his evidence.

 9. The medical evidence itself consisted of the following material:

              i) A letter dated 30th October 2019 from the Appellant's GP in
                 Wigan. Dr K Finn writes that  the  Appellant  is  suffering
                 from "low mood and anxiety following trauma he  experienced
                 in Cameroon. He has features suggestive  of  Post-Traumatic
                 Stress Disorder";


             ii) A letter dated the 7th February 2020 from the  same  doctor
                 which appears to have been written for the attention of  an
                 immigration officer at  Dallas  Court  enforcement  office,
                 since it relates to the Appellant having to  report  to  an
                 office in Salford. Dr Finn writes that  the  Appellant  has
                 "significant mental  health  issues",  is  "suffering  with
                 anxiety and depression" and "may even have a more pervasive
                 mental disorder". Dr Finn also writes that the Appellant is
                 being "assessed by psychiatry" and asks that the  frequency
                 of his reporting trips be reduced;

            iii) GP records showing the Appellant has been prescribed  anti-
                 depressants;

             iv) A letter dated 11th February 2020 from Wigan Mental  Health
                 Urgent  Response  Team  to  Dr  Finn.   The  writer,  Jenny
                 Simpson,  does  not  identify  her   qualifications.    She
                 explains that the Appellant has reported feeling  depressed
                 for the past two years, but in the last 12 months says that
                 he has started to hear voices  -  a  negative  voice  which
                 instructs him to harm himself and a  positive  voice  which
                 stops him. The voices argue with each other. The  Appellant
                 reported to Ms Simpson that he is  unable  to  concentrate,
                 has poor sleep and feels exhausted and hopeless. Ms Simpson
                 records that the  Appellant  is  a  Christian  who  attends
                 church twice per month but that he feels  he  has  isolated
                 himself from his friends because he  is  embarrassed  about
                 his mental health problems;

              v) A second assessment conducted by  the  same  service,  this
                 time dated  13th  February  2020  and  signed  by  Dr  Indu
                 Surendran. The letter is again addressed to Dr Finn.  Under
                 the sub-heading "impression" Dr  Surendran  writes  "severe
                 depression  with  psychotic  symptoms  (with  component  of
                 complicated grief). Cognitive deficits due  to  depression.
                 Significant trauma".   Dr  Surendran  states  that  he  was
                 unable to obtain clear details from the  Appellant  because
                 of his condition: "suffers from lack of  concentration  and
                 cognitive difficulties arising from psychomotor retardation
                 due to depression".   Dr Surendran gives the example of the
                 Appellant being unable to recall his own telephone  number.
                 The letter also records the Appellant's disclosure that  he
                 has distanced himself from friends at church  and  that  he
                 was unable to socialise or do routine things;

             vi) A final letter from the Wigan Mental Health Urgent Response
                 Team dated 19th February  2020  discharging  the  Appellant
                 from their service; it appears that his care was  continued
                 by The Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team.


10. As I have said, the First-tier Tribunal did not appear  to  doubt  that
    the Appellant does suffer from some mental health issues.  It was  not,
    however, prepared to attach more than "limited weight" to the  evidence
    produced. Neither Dr  Surendran  nor  Ms  Simpson  had  explained  what
    qualifications they had in the diagnosis or treatment of mental  health
    disorders; nor  did  either  refer  to  any  diagnostic  criteria.   Dr
    Surendran had not even  purported  to  offer  a  formal  diagnosis:  he
    instead records his "impression" of what the Appellant is experiencing.
      Further there was a contradiction between Dr  Surendran's  record  of
    the 13th February that the Appellant was so ill he had lost interest in
    socialising and what Ms Simpson recorded on two  days  earlier  on  the
    11th February: the Appellant told her  that  she  is  attending  church
    every two weeks and that his friend from Church contacts him if he  has
    not seen him for a while.  The Tribunal also regarded  the  Appellant's
    claimed social isolation as being inconsistent with his claim to  be  a
    political activist, regularly attending demonstrations etc.  It was not
    satisfied that Dr Surendran would have recorded those  matters  in  his
    letters, and formed the impression that he did, had he  been  aware  of
    the true picture.


11. The written grounds take issue generally  with  this  analysis  by  the
    Tribunal, submitting in essence that the decision  reflects  a  partial
    reading of the material, with the Tribunal  failing  to  weigh  in  the
    balance key elements of it, including the Appellant's reported auditory
    hallucinations, and Dr Finn's assessment that he "may even have a  more
    pervasive mental disorder". In further  written  submissions,  prepared
    following Covid-19 Directions on the 27th July 2020 Mr Pipe expands  on
    that to point out that the letters  from  Wigan  Mental  Health  Urgent
    Response Team were written following a  "comprehensive  assessment"  of
    the Appellant. Mr Pipe highlights the aspects of the  medical  evidence
    which offers commentary on the Appellant's ability  to  recall  certain
    events and contrasts these with the Tribunal's reference  [at  its  �28
    and 29] to the Appellant being an intelligent man and to its conclusion
    [at its �24] that none of his medical  conditions  would  significantly
    impact on his ability to recall events in Cameroon. I have taken all of
    the submissions made on the Appellant's behalf into account.


12. I deal first with the submission that there was some  contradiction  in
    the Tribunal deciding to treat the Appellant as a vulnerable witness on
    the one hand, and on placing little weight on the medical  evidence  on
    the other.  I find no contradiction arises. It was perfectly proper for
    the Tribunal to have recognised that the Appellant may  be  vulnerable,
    and so to enact procedures aimed at ensuring his fair participation  in
    the hearing. That  did  not  mean  that  the  Tribunal  was  under  any
    obligation to uncritically accept the evidence  produced,  or  to  take
    that evidence at its highest.    The  deficiencies  identified  by  the
    Tribunal were perfectly reasonable observations. None  of  the  medical
    evidence contained a formal  diagnosis,  made  with  reference  to  the
    diagnostic criteria in DMS V. It amounted to  a  series  of  healthcare
    professionals recording what they had been told by the  Appellant,  and
    in the case of Dr Surendran, what his  initial  "impression"  was.  The
    weight to be attached  to  that  'impression'  was  a  matter  for  the
    Tribunal.

13. Mr Pipe further submits that the Tribunal erred in failing to refer  to
    specific elements of the medical evidence, including the GPs assessment
    that the Appellant may be suffering  from  a  "more  pervasive"  mental
    disorder.   I do  not  accept  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal reveals there to have been a partial reading  of  the  medical
    evidence, or to suggest that the Tribunal has not  read  that  evidence
    with care. It is evident from the decision overall  that  the  Tribunal
    read all of the evidence before it, and was  well  aware  of  what  the
    Appellant had told the doctors and  the  mental  health  team.  In  the
    absence of any formally expressed diagnosis it is difficult to see what
    a paragraph dealing with Dr Finn's speculation might have added to  the
    Tribunal's analysis.

14. The crux of this ground is however that the Tribunal should have  given
    more weight to the medical evidence when it  assessed  the  Appellant's
    historical account. Mr Pipe drew particular attention, for instance, to
    the Tribunal's assessment  of  the  narrative  as  being  "vague",  and
    submitted that this was an unfair criticism given the medical  evidence
    showing the Appellant to have difficulties with his memory.  I find  no
    error in the Tribunal's approach for the following reasons.

15. First, I return to the fact that  none  of  the  documents  before  the
    Tribunal contained a formal diagnosis of the Appellant, nor explored in
    any detail the nature of his memory problems.  In  those  circumstances
    the Tribunal was not bound to accept that the Appellant  had  any  such
    difficulties.

16. Second, even if the Appellant had the worst memory in  the  world  that
    did not place any obligation on the Tribunal to somehow place weight on
    evidence that did not exist. The  part  of  the  account  described  as
    "vague" was the Appellant's claim that 20 years  ago  in  Cameroon  his
    father was an "influential member" of the SCNC.  That was  all  he  was
    able to say about the matter, leading  the  Tribunal  to  observe:  "it
    basically amounts to an assertion that he  was  involved  in  political
    activities without any details as to that involvement".    An  explicit
    recognition of the Appellant's  poor  recall  would  not  change  that.
    Medical evidence of  the  sort  alleged  to  exist  in  this  case  can
    legitimately preclude decision makers from reaching adverse findings  -
    for instance where a chronology has become confused -  but  it  is  not
    logically capable of compelling a Tribunal to "fill in the gaps"  in  a
    claimant's case.

17. Third, and perhaps more fundamentally, it is very difficult to see  how
    the political beliefs of the Appellant's father two decades  ago  might
    establish a real risk of harm for the Appellant today.

18. This was an account rejected for a number of very cogent  reasons.  The
    'section 8' factors loomed unusually large. It is  generally  the  case
    that that statutory injunction to diminish the weight to be attached to
    late claims will be of minimal  importance  in  the  overall  balancing
    exercise. Where however, as here, the claim is made some 16 years after
    the Appellant's arrival in the United Kingdom, it is plainly  a  matter
    that the Tribunal was entitled to place  considerable  weight  on.  The
    Appellant failed to seek protection  when  by  his  own  account  close
    family members were being tortured in Cameroon (in 2008),  he  and  his
    father were accused of arms trafficking (2010) his father was  executed
    in prison (2012), his  uncle  and  other  associates  were  given  life
    sentences (2013) and then the Appellant himself was handed down a  life
    sentence (2013). Even if one were to  accept  that  the  Appellant  was
    relying on his student visa  for  some  protection  against  return  to
    Cameroon there was still a five year gap before those efforts  becoming
    'appeal rights exhausted' and the claim being made.  It is against that
    background that the Tribunal made its analysis.


19. The Secretary of State has accepted that the  Tribunal  erred  in  fact
    when it directed itself that the Appellant  had  used  an  interpreter,
    giving evidence  in  French.  That  was  obviously  an  error  of  some
    significance,  given  the  Appellant's  claim  be  a  fighter  for  the
    independence of English-speaking Cameroon. I am not  however  satisfied
    that it is an error of such magnitude that the decision falls to be set
    aside. As Mr McVeety observes, it sat alongside the  Tribunal's  other,
    unchallenged observations that the Appellant was  himself  resident  in
    French speaking Cameroon, and in fact needed to attend English language
    classes when he first arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  student.
    Absent that one mistake of  fact  the  remaining  credibility  findings
    would stand. There was no support in the  country  background  evidence
    for the notion that the Cameroonian authorities would pursue, in  2013,
    a prosecution against a man who had left the country in 2002.  Nor  was
    there any credible explanation as  to  why  the  Appellant  left  it  a
    further five years before he made his claim.

20. That leaves  the  matter  of  the  Appellant's  sur  place  activities.
    Having apparently undertaken no political activity in  the  years  that
    his family were allegedly facing brutal persecution  in  Cameroon,  the
    Appellant claims that he embarked on a new phase of political  activism
    in 2016 after he attended a protest in London.  Although the  Secretary
    of State challenges this, by my reading of the  decision  the  Tribunal
    appears to accept  that  the  Appellant  has  indeed  attended  various
    meetings and protests in the United  Kingdom,  becoming  "significantly
    involved" in 2018-19.  What it was  not  prepared  to  accept  was  his
    claimed motivation for doing so.  The delay was one point. Another  was
    the Appellant's inability to provide a consistent explanation  for  why
    he felt moved to start his activism. The grounds do not  challenge  the
    Tribunal's conclusion that the Appellant is acting in bad  faith.  What
    they do challenge is the conclusion drawn, that the Appellant faces  no
    Danian risk as a result.

21. At its paragraph 35-37 the Tribunal considers  the  country  background
    material, including the CPIN Cameroon:  Anglophones  (March  2020).  It
    concludes that whilst there  is  extensive  evidence  of  human  rights
    abuses being perpetrated against Anglophone separatists,  there  is  no
    significant evidence of such abuses being targeted  at  people  in  the
    diaspora, nor  upon  return  to  Cameroon.  Specifically  there  is  no
    evidence that the Cameroonian authorities are  conducting  surveillance
    of diaspora communities abroad.   The grounds challenge those  findings
    on the basis that they are contrary to a passage in the CPIN at  2.4.6:
    "Sources note that Anglophones living in the diaspora who criticize  or
    are perceived to oppose the government and advocate secession may  face
    arrest and detention on return  depending  on  their  profile  and  the
    nature of their views".

22. I am satisfied that there is no arguable error in the  failure  of  the
    Tribunal to refer specifically to that passage.   In fact the  Tribunal
    gives very careful attention to the  possible  Danian  risk,  directing
    itself to the principle in YB (Eritrea) [2008] EWCA Civ 360 that a risk
    may be found even in the absence of hard  evidence  if  the  regime  in
    question is particularly malign. It accepts that there is good evidence
    of the Cameroonian authorities persecuting Anglophones. But  crucially,
    it does not accept that the Appellant is  an  Anglophone.  Nor  did  it
    accept that he is a person with a particularly high profile,  nor  that
    his purported political views are genuine. In those  circumstances  the
    passage cited from the CPIN offers no assistance to the Appellant.  The
    Tribunal was rationally entitled to reach the conclusion that  it  did:
    the opportunistic involvement of this Francophone was not of the  level
    that he would be reasonably likely to have come to the attention of the
    Cameroonian government.

23. The appeal is therefore dismissed.


      Decisions


24. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material error
    of law and it is upheld.


25. There is an order for anonymity.
