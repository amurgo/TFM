Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Tampuri, Chancery CS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 5 May 1978. He appeals
      with permission against the  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Turnock dismissing his appeal against the refusal by the respondent to
      issue him with a document confirming his right to residence under  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. The  appeal  was  decided  on  the
      papers.

   2. On 13 October 2015 his earlier application  for  confirmation  of  his
      right to permanent residence was refused with a right of  appeal.  His
      subsequent appeal was dismissed by First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Bradshaw
      in a decision promulgated  on  23  March  2016.  His  application  for
      permission to appeal that decision was refused in August 2016.

   3. His claim was made on the basis  that  he  has  retained  a  right  of
      residence under Regulation 10(5)(a-c) and Regulation 15(1)(f)  of  the
      2006 Regulations. He contends in particular that his former spouse was
      exercising Treaty rights in the UK from 2009 up until "her  last  date
      of divorce" [10].

   4. It was not disputed that the  appellant  married  his  ex-wife  on  20
      February 2010 and that the marriage had  subsisted  for  a  period  in
      excess of three years. The Judge also found that the couple resided in
      the UK for at least one year during the duration of the marriage.

   5. Judge Turnock noted that the appellant needed to  establish  that  his
      former spouse was a qualified person  and  that  he  was  residing  in
      accordance with the regulations at the point of divorce. Evidence  was
      thus required that his former spouse was exercising Treaty rights when
      the decree was issued. The parties were divorced on  3  December  2013
      [25].

   6. The Judge noted that the current application and the subsequent appeal
      are to be determined on the basis of the  evidence  presented  by  the
      appellant on this occasion. The previous determination of  the  First-
      Tier Tribunal Bradshaw was not provided. The Judge stated at [19] that
      '... the absence of previous documentation, for example  the  previous
      Determination  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal   are   not,   therefore
      essential'.

   7. Judge Turnock noted that P60 certificates were  produced  relating  to
      his former spouse for 2011, 2012 and 2013. He also produced wage slips
      relating to his former spouse for 25 November 2013; 23 December  2013;
      30 September 2013 and 28 October 2013.

   8. He stated at [26] that, as noted by the respondent, the only  evidence
      of the appellant's former spouse for the tax year  2013-2014  is  that
      she received UK pensions and state benefits in the sum of �142  in  UK
      Pensions and State benefits only.

   9. He then had regard to the decision in Begum (EEA:  Worker:  Jobseeker)
      [2011] UKUT 275. He was not  satisfied  that  the  former  spouse  was
      exercising Treaty rights in December 2013 at the date of divorce.  The
      evidence did not establish that she was either a worker  (employed  or
      self employed) or a jobseeker at the relevant time.

  10. On 4 November 2017, First-Tier Tribunal Hodgkinson granted  permission
      to appeal. There was no indication as to  why  the  relevant  payslips
      relating to his ex- spouse spanning the date of divorce were not taken
      into account or were not accepted as genuine. Further, it was arguable
      that there was an erroneous finding with reference  to  the  sponsor's
      actual earnings.  The Judge's indication that the only evidence of the
      sponsor's income for the tax year 2013-2014 was that she  received  UK
      pensions and state benefits of �142 was arguably inconsistent with the
      finding of the Judge at [35]  where  he  identified  the  presence  of
      payslips spanning the date of divorce.

  11. Mr Tampuri relied on the grounds of  appeal.  He  contended  that  the
      Judge should have made clear and logical findings in  respect  of  the
      wage slips which related to the appellant's ex-spouse, as set  out  at
      [35]. He did not give any reason why the evidence of her employment as
      at the date of divorce was not taken into account.

  12. Nor did the Judge make a finding as  to  whether  the  documents  were
      genuine and sufficient, genuine but not sufficient, or not genuine. He
      referred to the witness statement on behalf of HMRC dated  1  December
      2015 at J1. AT J2 his ex-spouse's taxable  income  in  respect  of  UK
      pensions and other State benefits: 2013-14 was �142.

  13. In reply, Mr Jarvis sought to uphold the decision of Judge Turnock. He
      referred to the earlier decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bradshaw
      promulgated on 23 March 2016 dismissing the appellant's  appeal,  also
      decided on the papers, against the refusal by the respondent to  issue
      a permanent residence card.

  14. He submitted that the Devaseelan guidelines should have been followed.
      The first determination is to be regarded by  the  second  Immigration
      Judge as an authoritative determination of the  issues  of  fact  that
      were before the first  appellate  body.  Generally  the  second  Judge
      should not revisit findings of fact made by the first on the basis  of
      evidence that was available to the appellant at the time of the  first
      hearing. Those facts may be revisited in the light  of  evidence  that
      was not available to the appellant at the time of the first appeal.

  15. Mr Jarvis referred to Judge Bradshaw's  decision,  promulgated  on  23
      March 2016, where he found that no documentation  was  submitted  from
      Inland Revenue confirming self employment of the EEA national [13].

  16. Judge Bradshaw noted that with  the  appellant's  bundle  of  evidence
      there were four principal  wage  slips  from  Clear  Cleaning  Ltd  in
      respect of the EEA national, dated 30 September 2013, 28 October 2013,
      25 November 2013 and 23 December 2013 [14].

  17. He also noted that there was a letter from HMRC dated 5  January  2016
      which stated that records showed that the EEA national was  registered
      as self employed from 31 January 2010 to  6  April  2013.  The  letter
      stated that registration as a self employed person does not imply  for
      any purpose that HMRC has  accepted  the  employment  status  as  self
      employed and that the employment status is determined by the terms and
      conditions under which the individual works at any time [15].

  18. Judge Bradshaw noted from the respondent's bundle that  there  was  an
      extract from Clear Cleaning Ltd's filing at  Companies  House  between
      June 2007 and December 2013, the accuracy of  which  was  not  doubted
      [16]. The final entry is  19  December  2013  which  specifies  "Final
      gazette dissolved by compulsory strike off." Notwithstanding this, the
      entry on the original payslip dated  23  December  2013  for  the  EEA
      national has been lodged on behalf of the appellant. He noted that  as
      far back as 18 October  2011  there  was  an  entry  of  statement  of
      administrators'  proposal,  moving  on  to   31   August   2012   with
      "appointment of a voluntary liquidator" and an entry on  19  September
      2012, liquidators' statement of receipts and payments.

  19. There was also a copy of a witness statement  from  an  HMRC  employee
      dated 1 December 2015 in respect of the EEA national which covered her
      UK pensions and other State benefits, self employment, and "pay as you
      earn". In respect of the self employment section for the year 2012-13,
      in the "description of trade" it specified "nil shown"  and  the  same
      information applied for the year 2013-14.

  20. In the section "pay as you  earn"  for  2012-13,  and  2013-14  it  is
      specified that there is "no employment  recorded"  and  that  "records
      show a claim to benefits." Judge Bradshaw stated  that  there  was  no
      reason for him to doubt the accuracy of  the  witness  statement  from
      HMRC.

  21. In the circumstances, he concluded that there is doubt about the  wage
      slips for the EEA national lodged on behalf of  the  appellant.  There
      were no bank documents lodged which showed that  the  relative  salary
      payments were paid into the bank account of the EEA national [20].

  22. In the circumstances, he  found  that  the  appellant  had  failed  to
      provide evidence demonstrating that he meets  the  requirements  under
      the Regulations.

      Assessment

  23. The appellant elected to have both his appeals before  the  First-tier
      Tribunals decided on the papers without a hearing.

  24. In his recent appeal he  produced  as  part  of  his  former  spouse's
      employment, the same four principal wage  slips  identified  by  Judge
      Bradshaw.  Accordingly these  were  the  same  payslips  produced  and
      relied on.

  25. Mr Jarvis submitted that Judge Turnock came to the correct  conclusion
      despite having paid  no  regard  to  the  earlier  decision  of  Judge
      Bradshaw.

  26. Judge Turnock noted with regard to the  evidence  produced,  that  his
      former spouse received UK pensions and state benefits in  the  sum  of
      �142 for the tax year 2013-2014 [39]. He also referred at [35] to  the
      wage slips that the appellant produced. It turns out that  these  were
      the same payslips which had been produced to  Judge  Bradshaw  at  his
      earlier appeal decided on the papers on 23 March 2016.

  27. It is correct that Judge Turnock did not refer  to  these  slips  when
      concluding that it had not been established that the sponsor had  been
      exercising Treaty rights at the date of the divorce.

  28. However, having regard to the comprehensive analysis of Judge Bradshaw
      justifying his conclusion that there was doubt about the wage slips in
      the light of the  documentation  produced  from  Companies  House,  as
      evidenced by the compulsory strike off, particularly given that  there
      were no bank statements lodged showing the relative  salary  payments,
      that finding of fact stood as there had  been  reliance  on  the  same
      doubtful evidence and no additional evidence was produced before judge
      Turnock to dispel such doubt.

  29. In the circumstances, Judge Turnock was bound to conclude  that  there
      was doubt about  the  wage  slips  for  the  EEA  national.  That  was
      particularly so,  given  the  fact  that  there  were  still  no  bank
      statements produced showing that the  relative  salary  payments  were
      paid into the bank account of the sponsor.

  30. There has accordingly been no material error.
