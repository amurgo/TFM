For the respondent:    Ms Alice Holmes, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the respondent's decision  on
   26 April 2016 to refuse to issue a residence card evidencing a  permanent
   right of residence pursuant to Regulation 10(5)(d)(iv) of the Immigration
   (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, on the basis  that  she  is  a
   person whose continued right  of  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  is
   warranted by particularly  difficult  circumstances,  in  this  case  the
   domestic violence which occurred  during  her  marriage  to  her  Italian
   husband, [RB], an EEA national. The appellant is a citizen of Namibia.

Refusal letter

2. The respondent's refusal letter set out Regulation 10 in extenso but  did
   not set out the appellant's account.  The reasons for  refusal  begin  at
   page 3 of 6, immediately after the lengthy citation of Regulation 10, and
   may be summarised thus: there was no evidence of the exercise  of  Treaty
   rights by the sponsor; there was no evidence of the appellant  exercising
   Treaty rights in her own right after the  dissolution  of  her  marriage;
   there was no evidence of the support provided by Mr Justin Paul  O'Keeffe
   and therefore it could not be  accepted  that  the  appellant  was  self-
   sufficient; and there was no independent evidence of the claimed domestic
   violence which the appellant suffered.

Factual matrix

3. Following the First-tier Tribunal hearing and the Judge's  findings,  the
   facts in this appeal are not now contentious. The appellant  married  her
   Italian sponsor husband at the register office in Leeds  on  24  December
   2005, but the First-tier Judge accepted that marriage broke down in  2012
   by reason of domestic violence.

4.  The  marriage  ended  by  decree  absolute  on  1  March  2013,  divorce
   proceedings having been brought in the Principal Registry of  the  Family
   Division in 2012.  The parties were estranged  and  the  Court  dispensed
   with service on the sponsor.  He has not assisted the appellant in  these
   proceedings either.

5. The respondent searched the HMRC records for the sponsor and  found  that
   he was earning an employment income continuously from tax year 2008-9  to
   tax year 2013-14, and therefore the First-tier Judge  accepted  that  the
   appellant and sponsor had been living in the United Kingdom together  for
   5 years and that the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights during  that  5
   years.

6. There was satisfactory evidence that the appellant and Mr  O'Keeffe,  who
   now supports her, had a close and  long-standing  relationship,  that  he
   provided her  with  rent-free  accommodation  in  his  house,  that  they
   'enjoyed a level of co-dependency' and that he supported her  financially
   by providing money when she  needed  it,  about  �250-�400  a  month.  Mr
   O'Keeffe had also made a will in the appellant's favour, leaving her part
   of his estate.

7. In addition, the appellant was earning some money herself by  babysitting
   for friends, about �30-�40 a time, but this was  not  regular  work.  The
   First-tier Tribunal accepted that the appellant had not depended on state
   benefits at all since her divorce and that she wished to  return  to  her
   previous employment as a care worker.

8. At the hearing, the respondent was permitted to  raise  the  question  of
   comprehensive medical insurance, which was not among the reasons given in
   the refusal letter.  The evidence produced at the hearing  satisfied  the
   First-tier Tribunal that the appellant  did  have  comprehensive  medical
   insurance.



First-tier Tribunal decision

9. The First-tier Judge considered that the question whether  the  appellant
   was a self-sufficient person was the main issue.  After setting  out  the
   evidence summarised above, the First-tier Judge said this:

         "44. However, the requirements under the Regulations,  in  relation
         to self sufficiency, are specific and the appellant also  needs  to
         show that her income or resources  exceeds  the  maximum  level  of
         resources which a British citizen can have before  they  no  longer
         qualify for social assistance under the benefit system.

         45.  Unfortunately, the  appellant  has  provided  no  evidence  to
         establish this and it is not open to me to assume that the  support
         she receives from Mr O'Keeffe is above the level required.

         46.  I find therefore that this requirement has not been satisfied.

         47.  It therefore follows, from the above, that the  appellant  has
         not discharged the burden upon her  to  satisfy  all  the  relevant
         requirements of the Regulations and so her appeal cannot succeed.

         48.  Accordingly, the rights of the appellant under the Regulations
         are not engaged."

10. Judge Coutts dismissed the appeal. The appellant appealed to  the  Upper
   Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

11. Permission to appeal was  granted  on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal's  reasoning  at  [40]-  [44]  was  arguably  inadequate,   with
   reference to the question of self-sufficiency.

Rule 24 Reply

12. There was no Rule 24 Reply on behalf of the respondent.

13. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

14. At the hearing today,  Ms  Holmes  for  the  respondent  said  that  she
   accepted that the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was  sufficient
   to establish self-sufficiency and did  not  wish  to  make  any  detailed
   submissions.

Analysis

15. I am satisfied that the reasoning in the First-tier Tribunal's  decision
   is inadequate and/or perverse and that the decision should be set aside.

16. In the light of the concession on behalf of the  respondent,  I  allowed
   the appellant's appeal at the hearing.  I emphasise  that  I  would  have
   done so on the evidence before the Upper Tribunal, even had Ms Holmes not
   made that concession.

DECISION

17. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by allowing the
   appellant's appeal.
