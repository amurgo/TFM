                                     and


               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr  C  McWatters,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  the
                    Migrant Legal Project Cardiff

For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION

 1. The heart of this appeal lies in [26] of the decision of the First-Tier
    Tribunal (the "FtT").  This passage contains a basic error relating  to
    the language in  which  a  key  document  was  formulated.   The  error
    consists  of  the  Judge  stating  that  this  document  recorded   the
    Appellant's  name  in  Kurdish.   This  is  incorrect:   the   evidence
    demonstrates indisputably that the entirety  of  the  document  was  in
    Farsi.


 2. The second difficulty with [26]  of  the  FtT's  decision  is  that  it
    effectively finds that this document was a forgery.  The  twin  defects
    in this are that the Secretary of State at no time made this case  and,
    further, the Judge  adopted  this  approach  without  reference  to  or
    application of the Tanveer Ahmed principles.


 3. I am satisfied that [26] of the FtT's decision contaminates and infects
    all  that  follows,  which  constitutes  mainly  a  rejection  of   the
    Appellant's case on the ground that it is not credible.   This  adverse
    credibility finding cannot be maintained given that its  foundation  is
    unsustainable.


 4. Mr Richards, on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State,  acknowledged  the
    gravity and materiality of  the  Judge's  error  and,  ultimately,  was
    disposed to concede the appeal.


DECISION

 5. I set  aside  the  decision  of  the  FtT  and  remit  to  a  different
    constitution of that Tribunal.  Mr  McWatters  produced  a  draft  Rule
    15(2a) Notice at the end of the hearing.  I reiterate my direction that
    any application of this nature be made to the FtT within 14 days.   For
    the record, I note that a copy was provided to Mr Richards.
