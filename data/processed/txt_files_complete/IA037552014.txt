For the Appellant:     Mr H Islam (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge P A Grant-Hutchison, promulgated on 3rd October 2014, following a
    hearing at Glasgow on 18th September 2014.  In the  determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of Mr Md Mobash-Shirul Islam.  The Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born on  20th
    September 1985.  He appeals against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 27th December 2013, refusing  his  application
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant under the points-based system,  an  application  made  on  26th
    November 2013.  The basis of the  refusal  is  that  the  Appellant  is
    unable to qualify for 75 points as required under paragraph  41-SD  and
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules because he does not have access  to
    �50,000 or to adequate maintenance.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge had regard to the basic facts.  These were  that  there  were
    four bank statements from HSBC, Santander, Metro Bank, and the Halifax.
     The statement from  the  Metro  Bank  was  the  Appellant's  company's
    account.  The HSBC statement covered the period 13th November  to  17th
    November 2013 and  Santander  covered  9th  November  2013  until  18th
    November 2013, and they showed  a  sum  of  �18,509.42  (see  paragraph
    8(b)).  The Santander  statement  showed  balances  of  �13,123.08  and
    �10,353.25.  The Appellant transferred monies from  internal  accounts.
    Altogether he had in excess of �50,000.  He kept money in  the  Halifax
    and transferred  it  to  the  HSBC.   He  had  �50,940  which  included
    maintenance.

 4. The judge had regard to four specific submissions from  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State.  First, that the Appellant was obliged  to  produce
    evidence of funds held in his own.  Second, the period of the  accounts
    do not quite overlap.  Third, the evidential flexibility policy  cannot
    be applied because this is not a case of missing documents as it is the
    content which is wrong.  Fourth, the  Appellant  cannot  succeed  under
    Article 8 because Nasim is authority for the proposition that this type
    of private life is at the weaker end of the range.

 5. For the Appellant there were three basic submissions.  First,  that  he
    owned 100% of the company and he was like a sole trader.   Second,  the
    total amount in the account was �50,940.  There was no requirement that
    the maintenance monies should be held for any particular period.  There
    was no requirement that the accounts should be segregated.  Third,  the
    Appellant succeeded in the terms of Gulshan and Nagre in that it  would
    be disproportionate to refuse the appeal.  This was because "In one and
    a half months' time the appellant will have been here  for  ten  years.
    He should be given the right  to  reside  in  the  UK"  (see  paragraph
    10(c)).

The Judge's Findings

 6. The judge held that in order to prove that the Appellant had access  to
    �50,000 he had to lodge a bank statement from Metro Bank which shows  a
    balance of �22,077.37 as being held as at 17th November 2013.  However,
    "Unfortunately the account is in the name of Islam Limited and  is  not
    held by  the  Appellant  as  an  individual".   Although  it  had  been
    submitted to the judge that the Appellant owns 100% of the  company,  a
    limited company "Has a separate persona and any money held by  such  an
    entity is held under the  different  duties  than  monies  held  by  an
    individual".  Therefore, the Appellant could not obtain 50 points under
    the financial criteria (see paragraph 16).

 7. Second, the judge had regard to Article 8.  A  specific  reference  was
    made to Nasim (at paragraph 21).  It was said that

         "The right asserted by ... the Appellants, based on  their  desire,
         as former students, to undertake a period of  post-study  work  ...
         lies at the outer reaches of cases requiring an affirmative  answer
         to the second of the five 'Razgar' questions ...".

    The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in his finding at
    paragraph 16 that the fact that some of the funds relied  upon  by  the
    Appellant amounting to �22,077.37 were held not held by  the  Appellant
    personally but in a bank account belonging to a limited company  called
    Islam Limited meant that the application could not  succeed.   This  is
    because paragraph 41-SD makes it clear that funds  held  by  a  limited
    company of which the applicant is a director can be taken into account.

 9. On 27th November 2014 permission to appeal was granted.

10. On 4th December 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect that
    the Respondent's refusal letter was clear as to  the  reasons  why  the
    Appellant's application could not succeed.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 13th January 2015, Mr Islam relied upon two
    essential points.  First, he relied upon the  Grounds  of  Appeal.   He
    submitted that the judge had erred in taking the view that the funds in
    a limited company could not be taken into account, and this was clearly
    set out at paragraph 4 of the Grounds of Appeal.

12. Second, the judge had erred in that submissions had been made that  the
    Appellant was very short of completing the twelve year  long  residence
    period in the UK, and so discretion should have been exercised  in  his
    favour.  Indeed, as of now the Appellant had  completed  ten  years  of
    lawful residence.  He had entered, as his  witness  statement  of  18th
    September 2014 makes clear at paragraph 2, on 27th December 2004 and by
    27th December 2014 last year, he had been in the UK for ten years.

13. For his part,  Mr  Tufan  submitted  that  if  the  Appellant  had  not
    completed ten years'  lawful  stay,  then  there  was  no  "near  miss"
    principle to be applied, and the judge had no  discretion  but  to  say
    that the Appellant could not succeed on the basis of a ten  year  Rule.
    That decision could not be said to be "not in accordance with the law".



14. Second, as far as paragraph 41-SD  was  concerned  the  refusal  letter
    makes it quite clear that the requirements in Appendix A for attributes
    are conjunctive and not disjunctive, as  Mr  Islam  for  the  Appellant
    appears to be implying,  in  that  all  the  requirements  have  to  be
    satisfied, which they could not be done.

15. In reply, Mr Islam submitted that the Rules stood disjunctively in that
    it was necessary only to comply with paragraph 41-SD(a) or paragraph 41-
    SD(b) or paragraph 41-SD(c).  The Appellant satisfied the  requirements
    of paragraph 41-SD(a).  Mr  Islam  submitted  that  paragraph  41-SD(a)
    makes it clear that the phrase  "funding  being  available"  refers  to
    funds available to (i) the applicant; (ii) the entrepreneurial team ...
    OR (iii) the applicant's business.  Mr Islam submitted  that  the  fact
    that the applicant's limited company business had the funds was just as
    good as the applicant himself having the funds  because  paragraph  41-
    SD(a) so stipulated.  He stated that the  fund  was  available  in  the
    business in the UK.  The Appellant was registered as a director of this
    business.  His application at Companies House showed the address of the
    registered office.  It also showed the Appellant's name.  The Appellant
    was a  director.   Accordingly,  the  Appellant  successfully  met  the
    requirements.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law, such  that  I  should
    set aside the decision and remake the decision (see  Section  12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007).  It is unfortunate that Mr Islam did not have  with  him  a
    full copy of the Rules at paragraph 41-SD.  He was referring simply  to
    the Grounds of Appeal, at paragraph 4, which only set out paragraph 41-
    SD(a).

17. On this basis, Mr Islam made the submission that an applicant under the
    Rules only had to specify either the requirements at (a), or at (b)  or
    at  (c).   To  this,  Mr  Tufan  replied  that  the  requirements  were
    conjunctive and not disjunctive as Mr Islam suggested.

18. I am of the view that the requirements are indeed conjunctive and  have
    to be read together.  On that  basis,  the  Appellant  cannot  succeed.
    Whereas it is true that paragraph 41-SD(a)  specifies  the  meaning  of
    "funding being available" in terms  of  the  reference  to  either  the
    applicant, or the entrepreneurial team, or  the  applicant's  business,
    there  is  still  an  additional  requirement  to  provide   "specified
    documents to show evidence of the  funding  available  to  invest"  (at
    paragraph 41-SD(c)).

19. This is the manner in which the "funding  being  available"  is  to  be
    proved and demonstrated.  In this respect, there is a long list of some
    ten requirements.  The Appellant  could  not  succeed  because  as  the
    refusal letter makes clear,

         "The bank statements you have supplied for HSBC and  Santander  are
         not acceptable as your statements do not show the  required  amount
         over the same period, as HSBC Bank statements end on 17th  November
         2013 whilst the Santander Bank statements  end  on  18th  November.
         You therefore do not have sufficient evidence that you have  access
         to funds of �50,000 as the required funds are not shown on the same
         account within the same date".

    That leaves the question of the Appellant and his long residence in the
    UK.  He cannot succeed on this basis either.  The judge had submissions
    on this basis at paragraph 10(c) where it was put to him that  "In  one
    and a half months' time the Appellant will have been here ten years".

    However, this is tantamount to an argument of  "near  miss"  which  has
    been roundly rejected by recent jurisprudence  (see  Miah).   The  fact
    that by the end of December he had been here ten years cannot go in his
    favour because the determination  of  Judge  P  A  Grant-Hutchison  was
    promulgated on 3rd October 2014, and at that stage the Appellant  could
    not succeed under the ten year long residence Rule.

    It is not possible therefore to argue that the judge had erred in law.

Notice of Decision

20. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction is made.
