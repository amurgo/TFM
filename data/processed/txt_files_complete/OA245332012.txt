For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Bangladesh, date of birth 10  March  1998,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 23 October  2012,  to
    refuse entry clearance for settlement as the spouse of the Sponsor with
    reference to paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (The Rules).

2.   The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Majid (The Judge) who, on 7 November 2013, dismissed the  appeal  under
    the Rules but made no decision with respect to a claim, in the  grounds
    of appeal, based on Article 8 of the ECHR.  Permission  to  appeal  the
    judge's decision was given by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Foudy  on  31
    March 2014.

3.   It is common ground between the parties, with whom I  agree,  that  the
    judge made a number of errors of  law.   In  particular  he  failed  to
    properly take into  account  evidence  provided  at  the  appeal  which
    related back to and preceded the date of the Respondent's decision. The
    evidence showed the availability of accommodation, in a flat  owned  by
    the Sponsor, in respect of which they would have  exclusive  possession
    of part of the premises;  even  if  any  other  part  was  sublet.   In
    addition, evidence was provided to the judge from  specialist  property
    assessors showing that the occupation of the Appellant even with  other
    tenants was  plainly  far  below  a  standard  which  would  amount  to
    statutory overcrowding for the purposes of the Housing Acts.

4.   The judge's reasoning for rejecting the evidence was  that  simply  the
    evidence had been received after the date of the Respondent's decision.
    However it was not  appoints based scheme (PBS) case.  It is clear that
    the judge has failed to appreciate the  significance of Section  85  of
    the 2002 Act and had also failed to understand or apply the case of  DR
    (ECO: post-decision evidence) Morocco* [2005] UKIAT 00038.

5.   I find that the original Tribunal's decision cannot stand:  The  matter
    will have to be remade.   In  the  light  of  findings  or  conclusions
    reached the sole issue remains, in remaking it, is whether or  not  the
    Appellant met the accommodation requirements under the Rules.

6.   In the light of that evidence Mr Walker  sensible  accepts  that  there
    really is no sustainable argument to say that the accommodation did not
    meet the necessary requirements of the Rules.  Therefore  there  is  no
    other outcome than that the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  should
    be allowed.

7.   It is unnecessary to do so but the matter was  pursued  also  addressed
    Article 8.  The judge never dealt with it and that was a further  error
    of law on his part.  Having looked at  the  matters  which  were  being
    advanced before the judge,  it is plain that  the  Sponsor,  originally
    from Bangladesh,had worked in the UK for a number of years currently as
    a chef.   Mr  Zahir  referred  to  him  as  an  integral  part  of  the
    restaurant's operations, it seems to me that establishing  family  life
    in certain circumstances, not least in the  light  of  Kugathas  [2003]
    EWCA Civ 31, is regarded as a legitimate objective under Article  8  of
    the ECHR.

8.   A number  of  points  therefore  arise.   First,  the  application  was
    originally made around about 5 July 2012.  If that is the correct  date
    it predated the changes to the Rules on 9 July 2012  but  it  does  not
    seem to me that makes a  difference.   It  is  not  asserted  that  the
    Appellant could have succeeded under the amendments to the Rules in any
    event.  Essentially the argument has therefore solely  addressed  "old"
    Article 8 considerations.

9.   I, looking at this matter, look at it as of now.  It seems to  me  that
    the correct view to take is that  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  do  not
    simply have a choice to pick where they live, and there is  no  general
    right vested in the Sponsor to bring his wife to  the  United  Kingdom.
    Therefore  in  principle  compliance  with  the  Rules  is  a  relevant
    consideration and also the fact that they could have and do maintain  a
    family life in the home country of the Appellant, to which there are no
    apparent obstacles to the Sponsor returning.

10.  Ultimately  therefore,  applying  the  approach  identified  in  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27 and Huang [2007] UKHL  11,  it  seems  to  me  that  the
    position is, if  I find that the first four  questions  in  Razgar  are
    answered in the affirmative, in terms of proportionality it  cannot  be
    said to be on the face of it unreasonable to expect the Sponsor  to  be
    with the Appellant and nor does on this hypothetical basis strike me as
    disproportionate to stand  by  that  position.   The  consideration  of
    Article 8 is entirely a hypothetical one in the  circumstances  of  the
    case when the appeal succeeds under the  Immigration  Rules.   However,
    for the sake of completeness lest this matter go any further,  I  would
    have dismissed the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

11.    The Original Tribunal decision can not stand. The following  decision
    is substituted.  The Appeal on immigration grounds is allowed.

ANONYMITY ORDER

No  anonymity  order  was  requested  and  none  it  strikes  me  is  either
appropriate or necessary.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee of ï¿½140 was paid for the hearing of the appeal. It seems  to  me  that
this is a case where although the appeal  evidently  should  have  succeeded
before the judge the Respondent's original decision was based upon  evidence
briefly presented at the time.  Therefore it was perhaps  unsurprising  that
both the Respondent and  for  what  it  is  worth  the  view  of  the  Entry
Clearance Manager supporting the Respondent's decision illustrated what  was
in reality a shortfall in the evidence as presented at  the  hearing  before
the judge.  In those circumstances this seems to me a case  where  it  would
not be appropriate to make a costs order against the Respondent.
