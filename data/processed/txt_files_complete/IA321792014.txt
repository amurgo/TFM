                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 (SI 2008/269) I make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the  Upper
       Tribunal  or  a  Court  directs  otherwise,  no  report   of   these
       proceedings or any form of publication  thereof  shall  directly  or
       indirectly identify the Appellant or any of his family members. This
       direction applies to, amongst others, all parties.  Any  failure  to
       comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
       proceedings. I do so in order  to  preserve  the  anonymity  of  the
       Appellant's oldest child (who I will refer to as J)  who  is  now  4
       years and 8 months old and whose  health  and  consequent  education
       issues form the heart of this case.


    2. The Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
       remain both within the     Immigration Rules  and  pursuant  to  the
       1950 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on 3 June 2014.  His
       appeal against that decision  was  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Gillespie ("the Judge") on Article 8 of the ECHR grounds  only
       following a hearing on 7 June 2015. There was  no  cross  appeal  in
       relation to his decision under the Immigration Rules  which  stands.
       Following a hearing on 7 March 2016 I determined that  there  was  a
       material error of law for the following reasons.

Error of law hearing

    3. The Judge entirely failed  to  engage  with  the  question  of  what
       provision could be made for J in Ghana. He has made no reference  at
       all to the 199 bundle of background of evidence or Country of Origin
       Information Report produced by the Appellant. This largely, but  not
       entirely,  relates  to  Ghana  and  refers  to  stigmatisation   and
       discrimination against disabled people and children with efforts  to
       reduce this. The Judge ignored the evidence contained in the refusal
       letter. The fact that the Appellant's counsel could not find  it  is
       not a reason the Judge did not  consider  it.  This  evidence  is  a
       crucial part of the findings that needed to be made as explained  in
       Akhalu (health claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT 00400  (IAC).  The
       phrase  "My   conclusion   after   examination   of   all   relevant
       circumstances known to me" is simply not good enough. The failure to
       engage with all this evidence and explain to the Respondent  why  he
       rejected her position was a material error of law.


    4. In failing to engage with the question of what  provision  could  be
       made for J in Ghana, the Judge  could  even  begin  to  address  the
       question of the effect of removal on J's condition.  Rosaleen  Brown
       is a Social Worker who purports to comment on this. Nowhere  in  her
       CV is there any indication she has any expertise on the provision of
       services in Ghana.  That  is  not  a  criticism  of  her,  merely  a
       reflection of her CV. Her report is not mentioned by the Judge.  Nor
       do any of the authors of the professional  reports  comment  on  the
       question of the  effect  of  removal  on  J's  condition.  They  all
       identify the extensive support he has had  and  that  he  will  need
       extensive support in the future but  none  say  what  is  likely  to
       happen should he be removed. The failure to engage with  this  issue
       was a material error of law.

    5. J is plainly in need of extensive support. It is inevitable this  is
       expensive. It is inevitable the future cost of the extensive support
       will be a financial impact on the public purse.  That  includes  the
       cost of Special Educational  Needs  provision.  There  has  been  no
       assessment of this at all. The observation  [26]  "that  this  might
       place increased demands on the public purse" was  wholly  inadequate
       and is a material error of law.

    6. I was therefore satisfied that the Judge made a  material  error  of
       law. I set the decision aside. I preserved  the  findings  extracted
       from the Judges determination [14, 20, 23, 24, and 25] only which  I
       set out below. I did not  preserve  the  findings  from  the  Judges
       determination at [26].

The Judge's preserved findings

   7. The Judge found as follows;

          [14] "There is perhaps a degree of exaggeration in the  expression
          of  the  Appellant  of  the  various  fears,  including  fear   of
          discrimination in Ghana for disabled children."


          [20] "... the Appellant  might  face  difficulties  on  return  to
          Ghana, I would not hold those to be very significant obstacles. He
          has degree qualifications from Ghana.  His  family  and  his  wife
          originate from Ghana. He still has family members in  Ghana,  even
          though he might be estranged from them. His wife is educated to  a
          high level. They  should  be  able  to  reintegrate  without  very
          significant obstacles. They  have  undoubted  difficulty  to  face
          because of the condition of" J "but I do not consider this  to  be
          an obstacle to the Appellant's reintegration in Ghana."


          The Judge  then  moved  on  to  consider  Article  8  outside  the
          Immigration Rules and regarding the  question  of  proportionality
          found;


          [23] "...there are significant considerations of  enforcement  and
          deterrence to apply. The parents have wilfully overstayed  in  the
          United  Kingdom.  The  Appellant  in  particular  has  engaged  in
          protracted defiance of immigration control." His wife "is  not  so
          egregious in her conduct, she has been attempting to remain within
          the law throughout, making applications, albeit unsuccessfully, in
          apparently timely manner or otherwise awaiting the result, in some
          times considerably delayed, of  applications  by  her  or  by  the
          Appellant on which she was dependent...In the real world, at least
          as far as the minor children other than"  J  "the  children  would
          return to Ghana, at an age when they can reasonably be expected to
          adapt to new circumstances, with their parents, who can reasonably
          be expected to reintegrate and support themselves."


          [24] "The medical evidence shows  that"  J's  "condition  is  most
          complex. He has been born with physical deformities, including  to
          the hips, the feet and, to a lesser extent, the knees, that affect
          his mobility. He  was  born  with  deformities  to  his  hand  and
          umbilicus which required  surgery  to  correct;  there  remains  a
          degree of disability in the hand despite the surgery. He  has  had
          opthalmalogical surgery and requires further  such  attention.  He
          has a distinctive facial appearance, and bears hypopigmentation to
          his skin (albeit apparently  in  places  that  might  normally  be
          covered with clothing), likely to attract a  degree  of  unwelcome
          attention  and  discrimination,  especially  in  a   superstitious
          population. Although I think the  fear  of  discrimination  to  be
          somewhat overstated, I do accept that the  Appellant  has  already
          encountered discriminatory remarks from  his  brother,  concerning
          his son  and  might  well  expect  a  degree  of  intolerance  and
          rejection for his son and his family generally because of cultural
          superstitions."


          [25] "Apart from the physical manifestations of his condition,"  J
          "has significantly failed to thrive in development. His  condition
          is undiagnosed. It is attributed to some  genetic  fault  that  is
          unidentified. It is  described  with  the  generalisation  "global
          developmental delay". He is reported,  by  paediatricians,  social
          workers, advisory teachers and other therapists to  be  likely  to
          require specialist,  one  to  one  support  at  present  and  into
          puberty. In addition,  the  child  has  medical  issues  including
          recurrent bronchitis, asthma and  susceptibility  to  anaemia  and
          sickle-cell  anaemia.  So  unknown  is  the  cause  of  his   many
          difficulties,  that"  J  "is  enrolled  in   a   research   study,
          "Deciphering Developmental Disorders". At the date of  hearing  he
          was  being  prepared  for  further  exploratory  surgery  relating
          apparently   to   his   digestion.   He   attends   regularly   on
          physiotherapists at the Child Development Centre;  on  orthopaedic
          specialists  at  Great  Ormond  Street  Hospital;  on  speech  and
          language therapists at Putnoe Clinic  and  the  Child  Development
          Centre; and at a respiratory chest clinic at Bedford hospital."

Appellant's position

    8. The Appellant arrived here with a six-month Visa on 6 July 1999. His
       Visa expired on 28 December 1999 and he  has  been  here  unlawfully
       since then. He is now 42 years old (born on 18  January  1974).  His
       wife who is now 33 years old (born 19 April 1983) arrived here on 28
       August 2002 as a student with a Visa which  was  extended  until  17
       June 2008. Her EEA residence application was refused on 23  February
       2010. Their oldest child who was born on 7 January  2008  is  now  8
       years old but was 6 when the application was made for permission  to
       stay on 25 March 2014. J, around who this case principally revolves,
       is now 4 years and 8 months old having  been  born  on  1  September
       2011. The youngest child is a daughter who was born here on 17  July
       2013 and is nearly 3 years old.


    9. They have made friends here and the United Kingdom is the only place
       the children have ever lived. J has very significant health problems
       and would be unable to access the specialist support or education he
       requires. They have no family in Ghana but  have  many  friends  and
       family here. The eldest child is in full  time  education  which  he
       enjoys very much and he has lots of friends and believes himself  to
       be British. Some up-to-date school certificates were  produced  that
       show he enjoys school.


   10. There are only 6 speech and language therapists in Ghana.  J  has  a
       very complex condition. There is a lack of  medical  facilities.  He
       would face discrimination and bullying and would not have access  to
       the medication and support he needs.


   11. Amanda Rizzo, interim headteacher at St John's  Special  School  and
       College wrote (6 April 2016) that J has attended there  on  a  part-
       time basis since May 2015. It is a school for children  with  severe
       and profound and  multiple  learning  difficulties  specialising  in
       communication and interaction. He is in a class of 9 pupils  with  6
       staff who are highly  trained  in  specialist  teaching  strategies.
       There are school nurses on site and regular  access  to  speech  and
       language therapists, occupational therapists, and  physiotherapists.
       He is being referred to a dietician. It is  more  likely  that  this
       level of facilities is available here than in Ghana. He  has  global
       developmental delay. He has flexion deformities of 2 of his fingers,
       bilateral talipes valgus, recurrent chest  of  the  infections,  and
       gastro-oesophageal reflux. He has severe asthma which  may  well  be
       exacerbated by a hotter and dustier environment. He has a  nebuliser
       at home which requires a  secure  electricity  supply.  He  has  low
       immunity and is susceptible to recurrent infections and  may  be  at
       higher risk of tropical diseases such  as  malaria.  He  has  visual
       impairment so can only focus on objects close to him.  He  has  glue
       ear which affects his hearing. Due to his severe reflux he needs one-
       to-one support at all  meal  times  to  ensure  his  safety.  He  is
       unsteady on his feet and can only walk short distances. He can focus
       his attention on an adult led task for up to 2 minutes. He  is  non-
       verbal. He has no sense of danger. He requires constant  supervision
       to ensure his safety.  He  needs  familiar  environments  and  clear
       routines and structure. He cannot cope with a change of environment.
       He becomes very distressed by loud noises and  struggles  to  remain
       seated for more than 3 minutes. A long journey  would  be  extremely
       challenging. He would be unable to remain seated when a plane  takes
       off or lands and is likely to be extremely distressed by  the  noise
       and crowd as well as the change in his routine.  It  would  be  very
       difficult to put anything in place  to  ameliorate  the  distressing
       experiences during change and situations he does recognise and  feel
       familiar with. He is very resistant  to  having  his  inhaler  which
       could put him at risk on a long flight. His reflux is also likely to
       be a significant issue on a long flight. The school received �19,000
       per year to support all the costs relating to his needs.


   12. The up-to-date medical report and Statement of  Special  Educational
       Needs does not add to the summary provided above.

   13. Salome Francois, the Executive Director of the New  Horizon  Special
       School in Ghana emailed (17 May 2016) that it is  a  non-residential
       day school and does not have the facilities to cater for anyone with
       J's condition.

Respondent's position

  14. The whole family would be removed together.  The  Appellant  has  been
      here unlawfully throughout almost his entire time and spent  25  years
      living in Ghana where he  has  social  and  cultural  connections  and
      understands the language. His wife spent the majority of her  life  in
      Ghana and is aware of the customs culture and language of the country.




  15. Education, health care, and speech and language services are available
      in Ghana, the later through a non profit  making  organisation.  There
      are 5 active speech and  language  therapists  in  Accra  and  one  in
      Kumasi. More specialist training is required for autism and in  speech
      and language therapy. J is not British.


  16. The private life developed here unlawfully carries little weight.


  17. At the date of application the oldest child had not lived here  for  7
      years and it is reasonable to expect him to leave. Even though he  has
      now been here more than 7 years it is still reasonable to require  him
      to leave.

Background evidence regarding Ghana


  18. Sophie Morgan reported (28 July 2015) on the  problems  facing  people
      with disabilities in Ghana which does not materially differ  from  the
      information set out below.


  19. The 2010 United States State Department  report  identified  that  the
      constitution  provides  for  free  compulsory  and   universal   basic
      education for all  children  from  kindergarten  through  junior  high
      school.  Parents  are  required  to  purchase  uniforms  and   writing
      material.  The  2015  report  noted  that  the  government   did   not
      effectively enforce the antidiscrimination law and people with  mental
      and physical disabilities including children were frequently subjected
      to abuse and intolerance. Children with disabilities who lived at home
      were sometimes  tied  to  trees  or  under  market  stalls  and  caned
      regularly and some were reportedly killed by their families. Thousands
      of persons with mental disabilities including children as young  as  7
      were sent to spiritual healing centres known  as  prayer  camps  where
      mental illness was often considered a demonic affliction.


  20. Support for the Dzorwulu Special School  from  a  bank  was  noted  (2
      February 2016). A report from Teachers Deyond Borders noted  that  the
      Castle Road Special School in Accra provided an education for children
      with severe learning difficulties where all the students live  in  the
      hospital ward and few have much contact with their families. They were
      the  recipients  of  educational  materials  and  items  from  a  non-
      governmental  organisation  and  received   stationary,   wheelchairs,
      mattresses, detergents, beverages, and biscuits.


  21. The United Nations Human Rights Council reported (2 April  2008)  that
      there are many children of school age who do not attend school  either
      as a result of the unavailability of schools within easy reach or as a
      result of the parent's inability to meet the extra cost.


  22. The International Organisation for Migration noted (7 April 2010) that
      Ghana has 1,433 state owned hospitals and other medical  institutions,
      and 1,299 private and quasi government facilities.  Access  to  health
      services in geographical and financial terms continues to be  a  major
      hurdle for a large part of the population.

  23. UNICEF reported (undated) that there are efforts to eliminate  violent
      discipline in schools. They further noted that Ghana has been  a  role
      model for many African  countries  in  the  provision  of  free  basic
      education but the quality of education can be improved.


  24. Open Democracy (10 October 2014) reported that in Ghana it  is  widely
      believed that mental disabilities stem from being cursed or  possessed
      by demons.


  25. The Social  Work  and  Society  International  Online  Journal  (2013)
      reported that there were prayer camps and a stigmatisation  of  mental
      illness that adversely affects patients. There are historical cultural
      and symbolic practices and a lack of adequate mental health  resources
      and money.

  26. Human Rights Watch (2 October 2012) reported that people  with  mental
      disabilities suffer  severe  abuse  in  psychiatric  institutions  and
      spiritual  healing  centres.  In  the  community  people  with  mental
      disabilities face stigma and discrimination and  often  lack  adequate
      shelter food and healthcare. As part of  the  healing  process  people
      with mental disabilities in these camps, including children under  the
      age of 10, are routinely forced to fast  for  weeks  usually  starting
      with 36 hours of so-called dry fasting and denied even water.


  27. It is noted in an article Who is Disabled in Ghana (28 May 2012)  that
      there are no  support  networks  for  parents  of  disabled  children.
      Neither are there any other social interventions to help parents  cope
      with the onerous burden of looking after their disabled child.  Family
      friends and neighbours who see a disabled baby are more likely to pass
      negative and wicked  comments  about  the  baby  than  compliments  or
      support.

  28. It was reported by Voluntary Service Overseas  (undated)  that  it  is
      estimated that 10% of  the  population  in  Ghana  is  living  with  a
      disability and yet despite being such a large minority  many  continue
      to feel discrimination and alienation due to enduring  stigma.  People
      living  with  disabilities  find  it  harder  to  get  education   and
      employment. One of their workers noted the lack of access to the basic
      support children need such as wheelchairs, crutches, hearing aids, and
      learning support.


  29. A report was produced from Kickin-Stigma-Ass regarding their  work  in
      Ghana as volunteers and their efforts to improve the support for those
      with disabilities. The difficulties in finding a job were noted in  an
      Internet article (19 September 2013).




Discussion

  30. There is no Immigration Rule appeal before me  given  the  lack  of  a
      cross appeal as referred to above [2].  Ms Ma conceded that  paragraph
      276ADE of the Immigration Rules was not met in any event as the oldest
      child had not been here for 7 years at the date  of  the  application.
      She and Mr Whitwell both submitted that I should not "visit the sin of
      the parent on the child".


  31. There is a vast body of jurisprudence which assists in determining the
      issues in this case which I will summarise below at the various points
      they arise within my consideration and determination of the facts.


  32. Mr Whitwell conceded that,  because  of  J,  compelling  circumstances
      exist such as to mean that I could consider article 8, and  also  that
      the first three Razgar [2004]  UKHL  27  questions  were  met  in  the
      affirmative.


  33. I therefore have to ask whether  the  interference  in  the  right  to
      respect for their private and family life is necessary in a democratic
      society in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
      economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder  or
      crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection
      of the rights and freedoms of others.


  34. I see no possible argument for saying that national  security,  public
      safety, or the protection of  health  or  morals  or  the  rights  and
      freedoms of others have any relevance in this case.


  35. The protection of immigration control is a legitimate aim and  can  be
      said to prevent crime given the criminal offences that  are  sometimes
      involved in beaching immigration control and  the  consistent  message
      that the Respondent sends in that regard.


  36. There will clearly be an adverse impact on the economy given the  cost
      of medical treatment and education for J and of the cost of  education
      for his siblings.  If the cost was negligible  this  would  not  be  a
      legitimate aim at  all.  However,  Ms  Ma  conceded  that  it  is  not
      negligible.  That  must  be  correct  as  the  cost  of  J's   Special
      Educational Needs provision alone is currently �19,000 per  year,  and
      his older sibling attends school and his younger sibling will  in  due
      course. Neither representative disputed my stated  understanding  that
      the Pupil  Premium,  which  is  the  notional  cost  of  each  child's
      education at a State School, is about �6,000  per  year.  J  also  has
      extensive health needs and consequent costs.  Over the period J  is  a
      minor, as pointed out by Mr Whitwell, the  Special  Educational  Needs
      provision of J alone will be  in  excess  of  �200,000.  The  cost  of
      educating his siblings will be well in excess of �100,000.  Given  J's
      complex health needs, it is plainly impossible to  quantify  what  the
      cost of ongoing treatment would be. By any account the  cost  of  this
      family staying here will be very significant  and  far  in  excess  of
      anything the adults would be able to cover through their  contribution
      via taxation. I am satisfied therefore that it is necessary to  remove
      the family for the economic well being of the country.


  37. I therefore turn to the  question  of  whether  such  interference  is
      proportionate to the legitimate aim to be achieved? I bear in mind the
      further Razgar guidance that while it is possible that a  decision  to
      remove an alien will breach article 8 in its aspect of  "physical  and
      moral integrity", a very high threshold of anticipated harm will  have
      to be shown. The test is not to  compare  the  standard  of  treatment
      between countries.


  38. In relation to proportionality, which is really what is at  the  heart
      of this case, the ultimate question for me is whether the  refusal  of
      leave to remain in circumstances where the life of  the  family  could
      not reasonably be  expected  to  be  enjoyed  elsewhere,  taking  full
      account of all considerations  weighing  in  favour  of  the  refusal,
      prejudiced the family life of the claimant in  a  manner  sufficiently
      serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental  right  protected  by
      Article 8 (Huang and Kashmiri v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11).


  39. I must not leave out of account a material  consideration  of  central
      importance  to  the  individual  concerned,  but  recognise  that  the
      countervailing  public  interest  in   removal   will   outweigh   the
      consequences for the health of the claimant because of a disparity  of
      health care facilities in all but a very few rare cases. When  weighed
      against the public interest in ensuring that the limited resources  of
      this country's health service are used to  the  best  effect  for  the
      benefit of those for whom  they  are  intended,  the  consequences  of
      removal for the health of a claimant who would not be able  to  access
      equivalent  health  care  in  their  country  of  nationality  as  was
      available in this country consequences do not  weigh  heavily  in  the
      claimant's  favour  but  speak  cogently  in  support  of  the  public
      interests in removal (Akhalu).


  40. I bear in mind that


          "the absence or  inadequacy  of  medical  treatment,  even  life-
          preserving treatment, in the country of return, cannot be  relied
          on at all as a factor engaging article 8: if that  is  all  there
          is, the claim must fail. Secondly, where article 8 is engaged  by
          other factors, the fact that the claimant  is  receiving  medical
          treatment in this country which  may  not  be  available  in  the
          country  of  return  may  be  a  factor  in  the  proportionality
          exercise; but that factor cannot be treated as by  itself  giving
          rise to a breach since that would contravene the  "no  obligation
          to treat" principle" (GS (India) & others v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ
          40 at [111]).


  41. I do of course consider the children's best interest as my primary but
      not  paramount  consideration,  and  must  consider  whether   it   is
      reasonable for them to live elsewhere, and also their ability to adapt
      (ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 and EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014]
      EWCA Civ 874). I bear in mind they are not  British  (Zoubmas  v  SSHD
      [2013] UKSC 74), that all the family are victims  of  the  Appellant's
      behaviour  (Beoku-Betts  v  SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  39),  and   that   the
      maintenance of effective immigration control must not form part of the
      best interests of the  child  consideration  (MK  (best  interests  of
      child) India [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC)).


  42. I bear in mind that I must consider past, present  and  likely  future
      circumstances (MM (Article 8 - family life - dependency) Zambia [2007]
      UKAIT 00040) and AP (India) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ  89),  article  8's
      limited utility in private life cases that are far  removed  from  the
      protection of an individual's  moral  and  physical  integrity  (Nasim
      (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC)), and the  limited  weight  to  be
      attached to such rights where it has been acquired  while  status  has
      been precarious (e.g. Rajendran (s117B  -  family  life)  [2016]  UKUT
      00138 (IAC)). For a non-citizen child, education and time spent in the
      United Kingdom are not a trump card and as long as there has been some
      consideration of the interests of the  child,  the  family  will  only
      rarely be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom on  the  basis  of
      such interests (R (app Osawemwenze) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 1564  (Admin)).
      I bear in mind not  just  the  evidence  relating  to  any  short-term
      disruption of current schooling that will be caused by any removal but
      also  to  that  relating  to  the  impact  on  a  child's  educational
      development, progress and opportunities in the broader sense (MK).


  43. A useful summary  is  found  in  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decisions
      affecting children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197(IAC):

          (1) i)        As a starting point it is in the best  interests  of
          children to be with both their parents. If both parents are  being
          removed from the United Kingdom then the starting  point  suggests
          that so should dependent children who form part of their household
          unless there are reasons to the contrary.
          ii)      It is generally in the interests of children to have both
          stability and continuity of social and educational  provision  and
          the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the society  to
          which they belong.
          iii)    Lengthy residence in a country other  than  the  state  of
          origin can lead to development of social cultural and  educational
          ties that it would be inappropriate to disrupt, in the absence  of
          compelling  reason  to  the  contrary.  What  amounts  to  lengthy
          residence is not clear cut but  past  and  present  policies  have
          identified 7 years as a relevant period.
          iv)    Apart from the terms of published  policies  and  rules,  7
          years from age 4 is likely to be more significant to a child  that
          the first 7 years of life. Very young  children  are  focussed  on
          their parents rather than their peers and are adaptable.
          v)      Short periods  of  residence,  particularly  ones  without
          leave or the reasonable expectation of leave to enter  or  remain,
          while claims are promptly considered, are unlikely to give rise to
          private life deserving of respect in the  absence  of  exceptional
          factors. In any event, protection of the  economic  well-being  of
          society amply justifies removal in such cases.


  44. Mr Whitwell conceded that it is the children's best interest  to  stay
      here but that is not the end of the matter.   I  agree  with  both  of
      those submissions.


  45. J has profound health problems. He is likely to get  better  treatment
      here than in Ghana. It has not been established  through  any  of  the
      medical evidence produced that the removal of the health care will  be
      life threatening and it is clear that as there  is  no  obligation  to
      treat him, that factor alone would not breach article 8 (GS (India)).


  46. The trigger factor that engages article 8 can only  therefore  be  J's
      Special Educational Needs. This is a private life issue. It cannot  be
      said to impact on his family  life  as  the  entire  family  would  be
      removed together.

  47. In the absence of J, this application stood no prospect of success and
      could readily be  described  as  an  abuse  of  the  process  for  the
      following reasons. The whole family can  return  to  Ghana  where  the
      adults could work and the children  could  live  lawfully  and  go  to
      school. There would be no cultural or language  issues.  The  youngest
      child is an infant entirely reliant on her parents.  At  the  date  of
      application the oldest child was not yet 7. Even though he is now just
      over the age of 7 it is entirely reasonable to expect him to return to
      Ghana with his parents for them to resume their lives there and  where
      he could be educated albeit perhaps not to the standard  he  would  be
      here although it is plainly of a sufficiently high  standard  for  his
      parents to be highly educated. He will inevitably want to  stay  here.
      He is a significant drain on  the  public  purse  given  the  cost  of
      educating him. He will be able to adapt given his young age  and  with
      the help of his parents and will be brought up within the  culture  of
      both of his parents namely as a Ghanaian. He will be able to  progress
      in his education albeit in a different system.  He  has  a  future  in
      Ghana. The Appellant's  appalling  immigration  history  significantly
      undermines any private life rights he (but not the children) had.  His
      wife's overstaying and refusal to leave  also  identified  an  adverse
      immigration history which enhanced the public interest of her removal.
      Their ability to speak English is a neutral factor. As they  would  be
      removed as a family, and given article 8's limited utility in  private
      life cases that are far removed from the protection of an individual's
      moral and physical integrity  (Nasim),  it  was  unarguable  that  any
      article 8 rights relating to that would be breached by removing them.


  48. However J is not absent. He is a much loved member of the  family  and
      his rights must be  considered  together  with  those  of  his  family
      members and how they all impact on each other.


  49. The journey to Ghana would,  according  to  Ms  Rizzo,  be  "extremely
      challenging". I accept that as I have no reason to  doubt  it  or  her
      opinion. The Respondent has a duty of care to ensure  the  family  are
      able to return  safely.  It  has  not  been  established  through  the
      production of any evidence that they lack the resources or willingness
      to deal with the issues identified by Ms Rizzo for the period  of  the
      journey of a few hours, which in the context of the length of time  he
      would otherwise be here is infinitesimally brief.


  50. If he is in Ghana, it is not reasonably likely he will be  ill-treated
      by his parents or siblings. They love him. They will do the best  they
      can for him. They will not tie him to a tree or cane him or kill  him.
      There is no evidence they will send him to a spiritual healing centre.
      They could live near any of the Special Schools. He would plainly  not
      get the Special Educational Needs provision he  will  get  here.  That
      does not mean he will get none. He will get the same as other Ghanaian
      children with his level of disability. The Special  Schools  may  well
      rely on donors. That does not mean it is in some way less valuable  or
      available to J and his family. Only 1 of the Special Schools say  they
      would be unable to cope.


  51. In relation to the additional factor of his  health  needs,  there  is
      plainly a functioning healthcare system in Ghana with  many  hospitals
      where treatment is available for a large number of conditions. It  has
      not been established  that  they  would  be  unable  to  provide  such
      essential medical care as was necessary for J.


  52. In relation to the additional factor of his older sibling  as  already
      stated, I am satisfied that he can be educated and housed in Ghana and
      speaks  the  language  used  in  that  country.  There  is  plainly  a
      functioning education system because  his  parents  successfully  went
      through it. It will clearly be better for him to  stay  here,  and  it
      will be disruptive it to his education for him to move, but  there  is
      no reason he would not be  able  to  settle  very  quickly,  make  new
      friends, and adapt to a new education system. He is not yet 8  and  is
      many years short of having reached a critical period of his education.
      He will of course have the benefit of his parents who will be able  to
      settle him in and he will form part of  the  majority  culture  rather
      than being in a minority here. His cultural life will be  enhanced  by
      removing him to Ghana.


  53. In relation to the additional factor of his younger sibling, it is  in
      her best interests to be with her parents wherever they are.  She  can
      go through the  normal  education  system  and  have  such  access  to
      healthcare as all other Ghanaian children and be brought  up  as  with
      her oldest brother within the majority culture.


  54. In relation to the adults, whilst it would not be easy, the  preserved
      finding was that there would not be very significant obstacles to them
      returning. I am satisfied that this is correct. They are both educated
      and they could work or run  a  business  to  pay  for  educational  or
      medical support.


  55. There were discriminatory comments made by his older  sibling.  Whilst
      there may be a degree of intolerance and rejection in Ghana, there  is
      also a degree of intolerance and  rejection  here  and  discriminatory
      comments are made. Despite there being a  degree  of  intolerance  and
      rejection in Ghana, that does not mean that the whole  of  society  or
      even a majority of it is intolerant or rejectionist.


  56. I am satisfied that  no  one  factor  or  combination  of  factors  is
      sufficient to mean that the threshold has been crossed for  J  or  any
      family member to be able to stay. In my judgement,  despite  the  best
      interests of the  children,  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise
      falls in favour of the Respondent and removing the entire  family  for
      all the reasons I have given.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision.

    I dismiss the appeal.
