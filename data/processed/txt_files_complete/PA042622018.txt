For the respondent:    Mr M Mathews, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

      1. The appellant made a claim for protection with his wife and their
         two children as dependents. The respondent accepts they are
         Egyptian and Coptic Christians.

      2. The basis of the claim is that they are at risk from Islamic
         extremists because of their religion. This was particularly so as
         they have been involved with a voluntary group which sought to
         assist Christian women who had accepted Islam to marry to return to
         Christianity. The appellant referred to various incidents when his
         family were threatened and set out details of his appeals to the
         police for protection. His account of involvement and of threats
         made was not accepted. The respondent referred to the country
         guidance case of MS (Coptic Christians) Egypt CG [2013] UKUT 611
         which identified particular risk categories. These included
         converts to Christianity; those involved in construction or
         reconstruction of churches and had been targeted and those accused
         of proselytising. The respondent took the view that the appellant
         did not fall into any of these categories.

      3. His appeal was heard by first-tier Tribunal Judge Clough on 11 June
         2018 in Glasgow. In a decision promulgated on 6 December 2018 his
         appeal was dismissed. The appellant and his wife appeared and
         adopted their statements. He produced an expert report in relation
         to documents he had submitted about reporting incidents to the
         police. The judge accepted the incidents had been reported. The
         judge referred to his wife's statement in which she explained about
         the voluntary group set up to help girls return to their Christian
         beliefs.

      4. The judge set out the claimed incidents when threats were made. The
         judge then referred to MS (Coptic Christians) Egypt CG [2013] UKUT
         611 and the particular risk categories identified. The judge
         referred to the decision setting out that these would not
         necessarily preclude a risk outside those categories.

      5. Under the heading `conclusions 'the judge went through the risk
         categories. The appellant and his wife were not converts. The
         appellant was not involved in the construction or repair of
         churches. The judge then posed the question as to whether the
         appellant and his wife were proselytising. At paragraph 27 the
         judge stated:

             "While the Appellant's wife noted in her statement the group
             started in 2010 there was no specific claim made by the
             Appellant that he and his family were targeted for this reason
             ... I do not accept being part of such a group was a reason
             for the appellant seeking asylum with his family or indeed
             that they were part of such a group ..."

The Upper Tribunal.

      6. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
         judge was mistaken in fact in stating the appellant and his wife
         had not claimed they were targeted because of their involvement in
         helping girls who were adopting Islam to return to Christianity.
         Reference was made to the appellant's statement of 24 May 2018
         where at paragraph 10 he stated:

             My problems in Egypt began on 30 January 2014. My wife
             answered the phone on this day... The speaker shouted and
             threatened her stating we will not leave you alone infidels,
             enough is enough and get out of our way and don't go to the
             church again. We will never leave you alone infidels, we are
             monitoring you and we know that you have been doing since you
             were in El-Fashan...

      7. At hearing, both representatives were in agreement that the judge
         materially erred in this regard as there was evidence of specific
         claims the family were threatened for supporting conversion back to
         Christianity. A further example for instance is at question 33 of
         his substantive interview where he said they were attacked because
         not only of their religion but also the work they did with
         Christians who were contemplating marriage to a Muslim. If the
         underlying claim were true then the issue of relocation was still
         alive but there needed to be a proper factual finding on the
         preliminary claim. Both parties agree the matter should be remitted
         to the first-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

      8. I would agree that the decision is defective in the thrust of the
         claim was that the family's difficulties arose not only from their
         Christianity but also from their involvement with this
         organisation.

      9. As the parties agree that this is a case where the decision of the
         First-tier tribunal must be set aside no further written reasons
         are required. The requirements of subparagraph 40(3)(a) and (b) of
         the rules are met. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-
         tier Tribunal.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Clough materially errs in law and
is set aside for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.
