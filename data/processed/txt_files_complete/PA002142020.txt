Direction Regarding Anonymity
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is
granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
indirectly identify him or any member of his family.  This direction
applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is appealing against a decision of Judge of the First-
         tier Tribunal Gillespie ("the judge") promulgated on 18 March 2020.

      2. Permission to appeal was granted on  23  September  2020  by  Upper
         Tribunal Judge Smith.

      3. On 9 October 2020  the  respondent  wrote  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
         stating  that  the  appellant's  application  is  not  opposed  and
         inviting the Upper Tribunal to set aside of  the  decision  of  the
         First-tier  Tribunal  and  remit  the  appeal  to  the   First-tier
         Tribunal.

      4. In the light of the position of the respondent, I am satisfied that
         it is consistent with rule  2  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
         Tribunal) Rules to determine this appeal without a hearing.

      5. As both parties have invited the Upper Tribunal to  set  aside  the
         decision and remit the  appeal,  I  set  aside  the  decision  (the
         parties having agreed that it involved the making of an error on  a
         point of law) and remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be
         considered afresh with no findings preserved.

Notice of Decision

 a. The appeal is allowed.

 b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh by  a  different
    judge.
