Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Stevens (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Holmes (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. The Appellant, citizen of Albania,  was  born  on  February  26,
            1996. On  February  27,  2013  he  entered  the  United  Kingdom
            clandestinely and on March 5, 2013 he  claimed  asylum.  He  was
            granted discretionary leave to remain until  he  was  17�  years
            old. On August 29, 2013 he applied for further leave  to  remain
            in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the   respondent   refused   this
            application on May 2, 2014 and issued removal  directions  under
            section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

         2. On May  23,  2014  the  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
            Act 2002 (hereinafter called the  2002  Act),  as  amended.  The
            matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Khan
            (hereinafter  called  "the  FtTJ")  on  June  24,  2014  and  he
            dismissed the appeal after an oral hearing  in  a  determination
            promulgated on July 17, 2014.

         3. The Appellant  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  July  29,  2014.
            Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
            Tribunal Renton on August 18, 2014.  He found  it  arguable  the
            FtTJ had not demonstrated he had considered the appellant's case
            in the context of the background information.

         4. The matter came before  me  on  the  date  set  out  above.  The
            appellant was not in attendance but was represented by his legal
            representative.

         5. The respondent had filed a Rule 24 response dated  September  8,
            2014 but this did not deal with the issues.

         6. I invited Mrs Holmes to set out the respondent's  position.  She
            accepted the FtTJ had not demonstrated  he  had  considered  the
            appellant's  case  against  the  background  evidence  and  more
            worryingly had made no reference to the country guidance case of
            EH (blood feuds) Albania CG [2012] UKUT 00348 (IAC) but had made
            reference to AM and BM (Trafficked women) Albania CG [2010] UKUT
            80 (IAC). She accepted there was an error in law.

         7. I was satisfied the FtTJ had  not  demonstrated  any  engagement
            with the correct country guidance case or any of the  background
            material and in assessing credibility and risk  on  return  this
            was essential. I was satisfied there was an error in law.

         8.  Having  established  there  was  an  error  in  law  I  invited
            submissions on what should happen to the appeal. I  was  advised
            the key issue  was  credibility  and  fresh  oral  evidence  and
            findings would be necessary. I considered Part 3, Section 7.1 to
            7.3 of the Practice Statement.

         9. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:�


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


        10. In light of the Practice Direction I agreed the case  should  be
            remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard on all matters
            except article 8 ECHR.  There  were  no  grounds  of  appeal  in
            respect of article 8 ECHR so the dismissal  of  the  appellant's
            article 8 claim remains.

        11. No additional directions are needed as there is a full bundle on
            the  court  file.  An  Albanian  interpreter  will  however   be
            required.

        12. The parties should ensure compliance with any directions  issued
            in  light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure   (First-tier
            Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 will apply
            to this appeal from hereon.

Decision

        13. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
            involve the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  have  set
            aside the decision.

        14. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            fresh appeal hearing under Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
            and Enforcement Act 2007.

        15. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
            2008  (as  amended)  the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity
            throughout these proceedings, unless and  until  a  tribunal  or
            court  directs  otherwise.  An  order  has  been  made  and   no
            application has been made to alter the position.
