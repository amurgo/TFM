Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Soltani a solicitor employed by Iris Law LLP
For the Respondent:    Miss Rackstraw, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The First-tier Tribunal made a  direction  concerning  anonymity  under
    Rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules
    2005 and I see no reason to vary that direction.

2.   The appellant is a national of Nigeria  who  was  born  on  1st  April,
    1978.  She made application to the respondent for a  student  visa  and
    was originally issued with a visa on 25th  October,  2005  expiring  on
    31st October, 2008.  She then made application for a  student  visa  on
    24th October, 2008 and was granted further leave on 11th February, 2009
    expiring on 31st October, 2013.

3.   On 11th October, 2010 she made a further application  to  remain  as  a
    student and was granted further leave to  remain  on  7th  March,  2011
    valid until 1st September, 2011.  She subsequently made application  as
    the spouse of a settled person on 8th September, 2011 but  this  appeal
    was refused on 16th December,  2011  with  no  right  to  appeal.   The
    appellant was then served with a removal notice on 1st June,  2012  the
    appellant then made an application outside the Rules  on  compassionate
    grounds for leave to remain on 20th February, 2013.  This  was  refused
    by the Secretary of State on 30th April that year.  On 1st  July,  2013
    she made application for a Derivative Residence card which was  refused
    because the application was either void or an inappropriate application
    as no fee was paid.  She made a subsequent application for a Derivative
    Residence card on 22nd July, 2013 it was refused by the respondent in a
    decision which is undated and which appears to have been  sent  to  the
    appellant's solicitors on 4th September, 2013.

4.   The appellant appealed that decision and her appeal was heard by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Duff on 29th January, 2014 at  North  Shields.   He
    recorded at paragraph 5 of the determination and at the hearing  raised
    with both representatives the practical scope of the appeal given  that
    Article 8 was not relevant given that no removal  directions  had  been
    made for the appellant.  That appears to  have  been  accepted  by  the
    appellant's representative

5.   Ms Soltani said that even the appellant did not succeed under  the  EEA
    Regulations, in considering the  appellant's  Article  8  human  rights
    appeal, Section 55 required that the best interest  off  the  appellant
    child must be considered.

6.   The appellant's child is  a  15  month  old  British  Citizen.   It  is
    necessary for the appellant to work in order to support her  child  for
    whom she is the principal carer and she ought  to  have  some  form  of
    leave.  The  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  having  recorded  that  the
    respondent had yet to issue removal directions as  a  result  of  which
    there was no obligation to consider Article 8 issues.

7.   Now it is asserted quite properly  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that
    under GEN1.9 of the Rules removal directions are  not  required  to  be
    issued before Article 8 within the Immigration rule can be  considered.
     The judge erred by failing to consider the human rights  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules.

8. Before me the Home Office Presenting Officer accepted that the lack of  a
   removal direction would not automatically mean there  was  no  Article  8
   appeal.

9. I believe that EX.1 of the  Immigration  Rules  applies  in  this  appeal
   because the appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
   with a child who is under the age of  18  years  and  is  in  the  United
   Kingdom and is a United Kingdom citizen  and  I  find  that  in  all  the
   circumstances it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
   United Kingdom.  I indicated  as  much  to  the  Home  Office  Presenting
   Officer who did not seek to persuade me otherwise.    I find that  First-
   tier Tribunal Judge Duff erred on a point of law for the reasons  I  have
   given above I set aside his decision.  I remake this decision and I allow
   this appeal.
