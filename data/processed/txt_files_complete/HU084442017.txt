                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Ali Youssouf Hassan, was born on 30 September  1981  and
    is a male citizen of Somalia.  He entered the United Kingdom in 1990 as
    a visitor with his father. The appellant's father subsequently  applied
    for asylum and, whilst that application was  refused,  he  was  granted
    exceptional leave to remain.  The appellant has a substantial  criminal
    offending history.  Most recently, on 6 November  2012,  the  appellant
    was convicted at Cardiff Crown Court  of  possession  of  a  prohibited
    weapon, possessing a Class A controlled drug  with  intent  to  supply,
    possession  of  a  Class  B  drug,  possessing  ammunition  without   a
    certificate and he was sentenced to five  years'  imprisonment.   On  7
    August 2015, the Secretary of State decided to make a deportation order
    in respect of the appellant.  The appellant subsequently  made  further
    submissions in respect of Article 8 ECHR and, by a  decision  dated  21
    July 2017, the Secretary of State refused that human rights application
    and refused to revoke the deportation order.   The  appellant  appealed
    against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Housego) which,
    in a decision promulgated on 12 October  2017,  dismissed  the  appeal.
    The appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. There are two grounds of appeal.  First, the appellant asserts that the
    judge misdirected himself in law.  The appellant's appeal  fell  to  be
    considered under the provisions of Section  117C  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended):

         Article 8: additional considerations  in  cases  involving  foreign
         criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

            (a)   C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
            most of C's life,

            (b)   C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
            Kingdom, and

            (c)    there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
            integration into the country to  which  C  is  proposed  to  be
            deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

 3. At [22], the judge wrote:

         "Having been sentenced to a  term  of  imprisonment  of  over  four
         years, in order to succeed, the appellant must show not  only  that
         he meets Exception 1 [the exception set out at paragraph 399(a)  of
         HC 395 (as amended)] but that over and above that  there  are  very
         significant obstacles to his reintegration to Somalia."

 4. The appellant asserts that the appellant was not required, contrary  to
    what the judge considered to be the case, to  show  that  he  satisfied
    both Exception 1 and that there were very compelling  circumstances  in
    his case.

 5. The judge considers the various exceptions at [21]:

         "Section 117C, which is primary legislation, stipulates that  where
         there is a sentence of  more  than  four  years'  imprisonment  the
         public  interest  requires  deportation  unless  there   are   very
         compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those   described   in
         Exceptions 1 and 2.   These  exceptions  are  set  out  in  Section
         117C(4).  Exception 1 applies to those  lawfully  resident  in  the
         United Kingdom for most of his life,  is  socially  and  culturally
         integrated in the UK and there would be very significant  obstacles
         to his integration into Somalia (Exception 2 relates  to  children,
         and the appellant has none)."

 6. At [22], the judge considered that "the appellant must  show  not  only
    that he meets Exception 1 ... but that over and above  that  there  are
    very compelling circumstances.  It is not enough to show there are very
    significant obstacles to his reintegration to Somalia".

 7. We agree with Mr  Dolan  that  the  judge  has  not  expressed  himself
    particularly clearly.  We do not, however,  find  that  the  judge  has
    erred in law such that his decision falls to be set  aside.   We  agree
    with Mr Dolan that it is possible that circumstances which may be 'very
    compelling' thereby entitling an applicant to remain may  exist  whilst
    an applicant  is  unable  to  show  that  there  are  very  significant
    obstacles to his reintegration to his country of origin (see  Exception
    1).  Such a hypothetical applicant might fall outside  Judge  Housego's
    interpretation of the law by which it would not matter  how  compelling
    circumstances might be if the applicant could not also show that  there
    were very serious obstacles to  reintegration.   The  problem  for  the
    appellant in the instant appeal, however, lies in  the  fact  that  (i)
    there are  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  his  integration  into
    Somalia; and (ii) there are  not,  in  addition,  any  very  compelling
    circumstances which might otherwise justify allowing him to  remain  in
    the  United  Kingdom.   Judge  Housego's  misstatement  of   the   law,
    therefore, is immaterial in the appellant's case.  We suggested  to  Mr
    Dolan that the appellant had not shown that there were very  compelling
    circumstances in  his  case.  In  response,  he  referred  to  evidence
    highlighting the appellant's lack of education and inability  to  speak
    the Somali language.  Those factors had been  addressed  by  the  judge
    [52] who made findings with which we can find no reason  to  interfere.
    The judge concluded that the appellant had not told the truth regarding
    his Somali language skills, noting that the appellant was 18 years  old
    on arrival in the United Kingdom  and  that  his  brother  and  younger
    sister can speak  Somali.   The  judge  reached  a  finding  which  was
    available to him on the evidence and he has supported this finding with
    cogent reasons.  As for the appellant's  educational  attainments,  the
    judge  considered  these  at  [63].   Following  a  discussion  of  the
    evidence, the judge concluded that the appellant showed no  "deficiency
    in intellect" and that he could read and write with proficiency.

 8. Whilst we accept that "very compelling circumstances" may  exist  where
    the specific provisions of Exceptions  1  and  2  are  not  met  by  an
    appellant, where an appellant (as here) can neither satisfy  Exceptions
    1 and 2 or even come close to  satisfying  the  requirement  for  "very
    compelling circumstances", it is almost certain that he  will  fail  to
    qualify for leave to remain. Whilst Judge Housego did  err  in  law  by
    confusing the various requirements of Section 117C, any error does  not
    materially affect the outcome of the appeal.

 9. The second ground of appeal asserts that the  judge  adopted  a  flawed
    approach to the balancing exercise required by  Article  8  ECHR.   The
    appellant relies upon Maslov v Austria [2009] 1 INLR 47 at [71, 73  and
    74]:

          1. In a case like the present one, where the person to be
             expelled is a young adult who has not yet founded a family of
             his own, the relevant criteria are:

             -  the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the
             applicant;

             -  the length of the applicant's stay in the country from
             which he or she is to be expelled;

             -  the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the
             applicant's conduct during that period;

             -  the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the
             host country and with the country of destination.

          1. In turn, when assessing the length of the applicant's stay  in
             the country from which he or she is to  be  expelled  and  the
             solidity of the social, cultural and family ties with the host
             country, it evidently makes a difference  whether  the  person
             concerned had already come to the country during  his  or  her
             childhood or youth, or was even born there, or whether  he  or
             she only came as an adult. This tendency is also reflected  in
             various  Council  of  Europe  instruments,  in  particular  in
             Committee of Ministers Recommendations Rec  (2001)15  and  Rec
             (2002)4 (see paragraphs 34-35 above).

          2. Although Article 8 provides  no  absolute  protection  against
             expulsion for any category of aliens (see �ner, cited above, �
             55), including those who were born  in  the  host  country  or
             moved there in their early childhood, the  Court  has  already
             found that regard is to be had to  the  special  situation  of
             aliens who have spent most, if not all, their childhood in the
             host  country,  were  brought  up  there  and  received  their
             education there (see �ner, � 58 in fine)

10. The appellant has been living in the United Kingdom for over 25  years,
    having indefinite leave to remain, is a "settled  migrant".   At  [60],
    Judge Housego wrote:

         "For the appellant there is the fact that he  came  to  the  UK  at
         about 9 years of age, is now 36 and that much of his family  is  in
         the UK.  However, he is not on good terms with much of  his  family
         and he does not know well those with whom he is now on good  terms.
         Much of his time in the UK has been spent in prison or  engaged  in
         criminal activity and so that lessens the weight to be attached  to
         it."

11. As Judge Housego records, the appellant was  not  born  in  the  United
    Kingdom nor did he come here at a very young age.  The early  years  of
    his childhood were spent in Somalia.  Further, it  is  clear  that  the
    judge has had regard  to  the  criteria  set  out  in  [71]  of  Maslov
    (although he does not refer to that authority in terms) and  has  drawn
    attention to  the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offences  of  the
    appellant and to the "solidity of social cultural and family ties  with
    the host country".  The judge has also acknowledged that the  appellant
    has no particularly strong ties with Somalia but it was plainly open to
    the judge to regard the fact that the appellant spent  the  first  nine
    years of his life living in Somalia (about  25%  of  his  life)  was  a
    factor of some significance.  It matters not that the judge has  failed
    to refer to Maslov or, indeed, any other authority.  What  does  matter
    is that he has applied the principles of the relevant jurisprudence  in
    his analysis.  We find that he has done so.

12. Finally, Mr Dolan submitted that the judge had been guilty  of  "double
    counting" at [59-60]:

         "59. There are no very compelling circumstances in this appeal.  In
             addition Article 8  proportionality  assessment  required  for
             this decision there is the weight of the  public  interest  in
             removal of a foreign criminal.  The  length  of  the  criminal
             career, the appellant and its increasing seriousness mean that
             the weight to be given to the five year  sentence  imposed  on
             the appellant for firearms or for dealing in heroin on top  of
             a lengthy criminal record is very great.

         60.  For the appellant there is the fact that he came to the UK  at
             about 9 years of age and is now 36 and that much of his family
             is in the UK.  However he is not on good terms  with  much  of
             his family and does not know well those with whom he is now on
             good terms.  Much of his time in the UK has been in prison  or
             engaged in criminal activity so that lessens the weight to  be
             attached to it."

13. Mr Dolan submitted that the judge should not have used the  appellant's
    criminal offending history to diminish the extent and strength  of  his
    private life and, at the same time, used  it  to  increase  the  public
    interest concerned with the appellant's removal.  We disagree.  We  see
    no  problem  in  the  judge's  approach  to  the  appellant's  criminal
    offending and his view that the seriousness the offending should have a
    directly proportionate effect upon the public interest  concerned  with
    the appellant's removal.  Equally, at [60], the judge is doing no  more
    than trying to characterise and assess the quality of  the  appellant's
    private life in  the  United  Kingdom.   Not  unreasonably,  the  judge
    considered that a private life which had developed to a large extent in
    the company of criminals should not attract the protection  of  Article
    8.  The judge has also, quite properly, sought to determine the private
    life ties which the appellant may enjoy with other adult members of his
    family and has concluded that the appellant's criminality has  hindered
    the development of those relationships.  In consequence,  it  is  clear
    that the appellant does not have a particularly strong private life  in
    the United Kingdom whilst his serious criminal offending reinforces the
    decision to deport him.

14. In the circumstances and for the reasons which we have set  out  above,
    we do not find that the judge has fallen into error in carrying out the
    proportionality exercise under Article  8  ECHR.  In  consequence,  the
    appeal is dismissed.
