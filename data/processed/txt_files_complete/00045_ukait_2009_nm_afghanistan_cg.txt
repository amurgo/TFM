   1) An Afghan claimant who can demonstrate that he has genuinely converted
      to Christianity from Islam is likely to be able to show that he is at
      real risk of serious ill-treatment amounting to persecution or a
      breach of his Article 3 ECHR right on return to Afghanistan.


   2) This decision replaces AR (Christians - risk in Kabul) Afghanistan
      [2005] UKAIT 00035 only in so far as it deals with Muslims who have
      converted to Christianity.


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Jacobs, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Gulvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of  Afghanistan.   On  14  March  2007  his
    application for asylum was  refused  by  the  respondent.   His  appeal
    against that decision was heard by Immigration Judge  Ross  on  11  May
    2007 and he dismissed the  appeal  on  both  asylum  and  human  rights
    grounds.  The Immigration Judge set  out  the  appellant's  immigration
    history at paragraphs 1-5 of his determination:

        "1.      The appellant is a national of Afghanistan, who  was  born
             on 1 January 1960.  He first arrived in the United Kingdom on 7
             February 2000 on board an aeroplane which had been hijacked the
             previous day.  His claim for asylum was refused on 26  February
             2000, and  subsequently  dismissed  by  an  adjudicator  on  13
             September 2000, and by the Tribunal on 13  February  2003.   At
             that stage the appellant was claiming asylum on the basis  that
             he feared reprisals from a group within  Afghanistan  connected
             with the Taliban.


        2. On 30 June 2005 those representing the appellant  wrote  to  the
             respondent seeking asylum, and  claiming  that  to  return  the
             appellant to Afghanistan would breach his human rights.  On  10
             March 2006 the respondent decided  that  the  letter  would  be
             treated as a fresh claim since it raised new  issues.   In  the
             letter  his  solicitors  indicated  that  the   appellant   had
             converted to the Christian faith,  and  in  support  statements
             were tendered from Christian friends of the  appellant  in  the
             United Kingdom.


        3. The appellant was interviewed on 1 February 2007,  and  asked  a
             number of questions about his new faith.  Since it is  accepted
             by the respondent for the purposes of  this  appeal,  that  the
             appellant has indeed converted to the Christian faith, I  shall
             not deal with the questions and answers in any detail.  He  did
             indicate however in the interview that he had  been  threatened
             by two fellow Afghanis.  These men  were  living  in  the  same
             house as him, and threatened him because  he  had  changed  his
             religion.  They were both deported  back  to  Afghanistan.   He
             said that he did not report these men because he was scared  of
             them.  He said that he attempted to  convert  other  people  to
             Christianity.  He also said that he told other Muslims that  he
             was a Christian, and that this would put  him  in  considerable
             danger in Afghanistan.


        4. His application was refused on 14 March 2007 on the  basis  that
             although it was accepted that he was a Christian, there was  no
             objective evidence that he would be executed for  apostasy,  or
             that he would be of adverse interest to either the  authorities
             or the wider Afghan public.  Consideration was  also  given  to
             his claim under Article 8, on the basis that he  suffered  from
             low back pay [sic pain], but this was also rejected.


        5. The appellant appealed against the decision of 13 April 2007, on
             the basis that if he was returned he  would  face  persecution,
             and possibly the death penalty."

2.    Mr  Jacobs  helpfully  set  out  in  his  skeleton  the  evidence  the
    Immigration Judge accepted as credible. No challenge is raised  to  his
    findings in respect of the appellant's claim.   The  established  facts
    therefore are as follows:

        (i) that a number of fellow Afghan asylum seekers who lived in  the
             appellant's house became aware that the appellant was attending
             church and Christian meetings;


        (ii)     that the appellant was threatened by a  number  of  Afghan
             men, in particular YM and NJK.  These men live in the same part
             of Afghanistan as the appellant and know him well.


        (iii)    YM and NJK threatened to kill the appellant and force  him
             to stop attending Christian meetings.


        (iv)      YM  and  NJK  spread  rumours  concerning  the  appellant
             throughout the Afghan community.


        (v) The appellant  is  easily  recognisable  as  he  walks  with  a
             prominent stoop.


        (vi)     As a result of the threats the appellant ceased  attending
             the group due to safety fears.


        (vii)     The  appellant  resumed  attending  church  bible   study
             meetings and services after May 2004 through the assistance  of
             Dr and Mrs Freeman.


        (viii)   YM and  NJK  returned  to  Afghanistan.   Prior  to  their
             departure they told the appellant that he would be killed if he
             returned to Afghanistan because of the  appellant's  conversion
             to Christianity.


        (ix)     The appellant continued to receive threats at  his  hostel
             accommodation and on 25 June  2005  fellow  residents  who  are
             Muslims reacted angrily to Dr and Mrs Freeman's son  attempting
             to collect the  appellant  to  take  him  to  a  meeting.   The
             residents identified the car of Dr Freeman,  which  was  parked
             three streets away from the appellant's hostel.


        (x) The appellant has continued to  practise  Christianity  in  the
             United Kingdom.  Local Muslims spit at him in the street.


        (xi)     The appellant has been told by Muslims in his  local  area
             that although they cannot harm him in the  United  Kingdom,  he
             would be killed by "people that they  know"  in  the  event  of
             return to Afghanistan.


        (xii)     The  appellant  was  baptised  on  8  October  2005.   He
             regularly attends Hounslow West Evangelical Church.


        (xiii)   The appellant has no family network in Afghanistan.


        (xiv)    Contact with the appellant's son ceased after his son  was
             told of his conversion.


        (xv)     The appellant has no contact  with  his  daughter.   As  a
             woman the appellant's daughter could not be expected to protect
             the appellant in Afghanistan.

3.    The Immigration Judge  accepted,  as  had  the  respondent,  that  the
    appellant had converted to Christianity and he also  accepted  that  he
    would be "viewed with disdain" by Muslims in his own country  and  that
    they may be hostile to him.  However he concluded there was no evidence
    that he would be at real risk of serious harm or persecution.  He found
    there was no evidence that the  authorities  persecuted  Christians  by
    prosecuting them, although strict Muslim law does  proscribe  apostasy.
    He found that there was no evidence apart from what he described as the
    'unusual case of Abdul Rahman,' that Christians are in danger from  the
    Afghan  authorities.   The  Immigration  Judge  was  referred  to   the
    Tribunal's country guidance decision in AR (Christians - risk in Kabul)
    Afghanistan  [2005]  UKIAT  00035.   In  that  decision  the   Tribunal
    concluded that on the objective evidence before it, which it  carefully
    analysed, that it had not been shown that Christians, including Muslims
    who had converted to Christianity, were at real risk of persecution  or
    Article 3 ill-treatment in Kabul.  The objective  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal at that time showed there was an absence of anecdotal evidence
    about the problems faced by apostates.  It concluded on  the  objective
    evidence and expert evidence before it that the evidence  of  risk  did
    not reach the low standard of a reasonable likelihood nor the  severity
    threshold for persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.

4.    The Immigration Judge in this  appeal  reached  essentially  the  same
    finding.  In addition, he concluded that the risk  that  the  appellant
    claimed to face from the two men who had threatened him in  the  United
    Kingdom was fanciful bearing in mind that the population in Afghanistan
    was over 31 million and that the appellant could minimise the  risk  by
    avoiding the area from where the men came.

5.     The  appellant  applied  for   and   was   granted   an   order   for
    reconsideration of the Immigration Judge's  decision.   On  18  January
    2008 the Tribunal concluded that the Immigration Judge  had  materially
    erred in law in reaching his findings.  In relation to his  finding  as
    to the lack of evidence of the persecution of Christians by the  Afghan
    authorities and in particular Muslims who  had  converted,  the  Senior
    Immigration Judge concluded as follows:

        "I agree with Counsel that the IJ failed to  take  account  of  the
        material evidence that was  before  him  both  in  the  appellant's
        reading schedule and in the submissions  made  by  the  appellant's
        Counsel which the IJ recorded at paragraph 11.   According  to  the
        grounds the IJ was referred to paragraph 19.42 of  the  Country  of
        Origin Information Reports (COIR) for April 2007  which  refers  to
        the UN Secretary  General  reporting  that  there  had  been  three
        similar cases to that of Abdul Rahman in which Afghan citizen [sic]
        were accused of apostasy by local religious leaders and were forced
        to leave the country.


        I also agree with  Counsel  that  in  assessing  the  risk  to  the
        appellant, the IJ focused on the risk  to  Christians  rather  than
        converts.  The IJ also failed to consider that because the two  men
        had been deported to Afghanistan, the appellant's conversion is now
        known in Afghanistan.


        We know from paragraph 3.13.7 OGN, which is cited by SIJ Jordan  in
        his order for reconsideration that where the  appellant's  fear  is
        either at the hands of  the  state  or  of  societal  or  non-state
        persecution, sufficiency of protection should not be considered  to
        be available for apostates in Afghanistan.


        Therefore the issues in this case are:


             1.   Is there objective material  to  support  the  appellant's
                 claim that because of his  conversion  to  Christianity  he
                 faces a real risk of persecution either from  the  two  men
                 who have been  deported  to  Afghanistan  or  from  society
                 generally; and


             2.   whether the appellant can relocate within  Afghanistan  in
                 order to avoid persecution."



Documentary Evidence before the Tribunal

6.    The Tribunal has set out the documentary evidence  before  it  in  the
    appendix to this determination.

Witness Evidence before the Tribunal

The Report of Dr Antonio Giustozzi

7.    We set out first in summary the contents of Dr Giustozzi's  report  to
    the Tribunal followed by his oral evidence, again in  summary.   It  is
    accepted in this case that  Dr  Giustozzi  is  qualified  to  give  the
    Tribunal an expert opinion on the issues in this appeal.  No  challenge
    was raised to this by Mr Gulvin.  The  Tribunal  was  referred  to  its
    comments as to the expertise of Dr Giustozzi in  the  country  guidance
    decision of PM and Others (Kabul - Hizb-i-Islami) Afghanistan CG [2007]
    UKAIT 00089.  It is not  necessary  for  the  Tribunal  to  repeat  the
    comments made in that decision however we adopt the same  in  terms  of
    our approach to Dr Giustozzi's evidence.  This does not  mean  that  we
    accept without  question  everything  he  has  told  the  Tribunal;  we
    approach his evidence on the basis that he is an expert;  his  evidence
    does warrant significant weight however the Tribunal clearly has a duty
    to undertake a critical analysis of Dr Giustozzi's  opinion  which  can
    only be done in a context of the evidence as a whole.

8.     We  do  not  therefore  repeat  Dr  Giustozzi's  qualifications   and
    experience, which we note from paragraph 1 of his report, save  to  say
    that he is currently a Research Fellow at London  School  of  Economics
    and Political Science.

9.    In his report Dr Giustozzi said the appellant would  not  be  able  to
    practise his Christian faith openly if he returned to Afghanistan.   He
    states that the small community  of  Afghan  converts  to  Christianity
    practises exclusively underground.  The appellant would not be able  to
    proselytise as he would then expose himself to a much greater  risk  of
    detection.  The appellant could avoid detection by  maintaining  a  low
    profile and avoiding discussing his beliefs however he  would  have  to
    outwardly behave as a Muslim, i.e. fast during Ramadan at  least.   The
    appellant would have to identify an underground  Christian  network  in
    order to practise Christianity.  Dr Giustozzi said that  although  such
    networks are alleged to exist, seeking one out would entail a degree of
    risk of detection.  The chance of finding such  a  network  outside  of
    Kabul would be negligible.  He is of  the  opinion  that  even  if  the
    appellant chose to worship underground there would always be  the  risk
    of detection sooner or later.  This would arise from two  sources:  the
    judiciary and extremist Islamic groups.

10.   Dr Giustozzi dealt with  judicial  and  government  attitudes  towards
    converts.  The Afghan constitution does recognise the  rights  of  non-
    Muslims to practise their faith but does not  recognise  the  right  of
    Afghans to abandon Islam.  Conversion to  another  religion  or  simply
    renouncing Islam is considered to be apostasy and is not allowed.

11.   Dr Giustozzi refers to the statements of Supreme Court  Chief  Justice
    Shinwari to the effect that he wished Sharia Law to remain the basis of
    the Afghan justice system and that he would  continue  to  enforce  it.
    The Tribunal notes that this evidence was considered by the Tribunal in
    AR. Dr Giustozzi states that the Supreme Court repeated the claim  that
    whatever Afghanistan's law codes might say, Sharia Law overrules  them.
    The Supreme  Court  advocates  harsh  sentences,  including  the  death
    penalty for crimes  such  as  blasphemy  and  apostasy.   The  official
    position of the Afghan cabinet however is that the Constitution is  the
    supreme law of the country but that is silent on the issue of apostasy.
     Article 1(30) of the Constitution states that  Hanafi  (i.e.  shariat)
    jurisprudence applies wherever the law is silent.  Dr Giustozzi  opines
    therefore that the Chief Justice was right when he said that he invokes
    the supreme punishment for apostasy and that the possibility of a death
    sentence being passed on someone in those circumstances is strong:

        "Although  it  is  not  clear  whether  it  would  effectively   be
        implemented."

12.   Dr Giustozzi then deals with the  case  of  Abdul  Rahman  who  was  a
    returnee from Germany and who was accused by his own family  of  having
    converted  to  Christianity.   President  Karzai  had  to  use  a  ruse
    following heavy pressure from Germany  and  the  US  to  prevent  Abdul
    Rahman  being  tried  according  to  the  shariat.   President   Karzai
    eventually obtained the release of Abdul Rahman from protective custody
    under a technicality  and  Mr  Rahman  had  to  be  transferred  abroad
    immediately before a new arrest warrant  could  be  issued  or  he  was
    harmed by Islamic radicals.  He  was  subsequently  offered  asylum  in
    Italy.  President  Karzai  came  under  significant  criticism  in  the
    country  for  having  taken  this   action.    This   included   street
    demonstrations demanding Mr Rahman's return to  Afghanistan  for  trial
    and the criticism of fellow Afghan MPs.  Dr Giustozzi says that  if  an
    Afghan convert to Christianity  was  to  be  sentenced  in  Afghanistan
    President Karzai was now widely expected not  to  countersign  a  death
    sentence and instead to convert it to a prison sentence.

13.   Dr Giustozzi states that  the  Afghan  government  does  not  have  an
    active policy of seeking and identifying apostates however neither does
    it interfere when individuals are  executed  by  their  own  family  or
    community because of apostasy.  He cites two cases of March 2006  where
    local authorities allegedly arrested two individuals accused  of  being
    Christian converts, but nothing more is known of what happened to them.
     In February of the same year the  houses  of  alleged  apostates  were
    raided by the police in various locations although no further  evidence
    is given as to what  happened.   During  the  summer  of  2007  another
    Christian convert was arrested in Afghanistan but was then released  by
    the Attorney General because of  political  considerations.   He  cites
    another case of an Afghan Bah�'�  arrested  on  9  April  2007  by  the
    police.  This man was born a Bah�'� and therefore not a convert but was
    still arrested because of a ruling of the Supreme Court in May 2007  on
    the status of the Bah�'� faith, declaring it to be distinct from  Islam
    and a form of blasphemy.  Again this man was released after  one  month
    because of pressure from the international community but he had to flee
    to another country with other family members.  The man's Muslim wife is
    seeking a divorce from him on the grounds that their  marriage  is  not
    legal in Afghanistan.

14.   Dr Giustozzi confirms that the number of cases of conversions  brought
    to the judiciary is few and the  number  of  converts  is  low  but  he
    considers that many have fled the  country  of  their  own  initiative.
    Those who do remain must be aware of an extremely hostile  climate  and
    must do all they can to avoid detection.  He states that it is  out  of
    the question that any Afghan converts to Christianity would be able  to
    practise their religion openly without risk in the foreseeable  future.
    He says there is a strong presence within the army, the police and  the
    National Security Directorate of Islamist organisations.  Such  persons
    are not likely to show much sympathy for  Christian  converts  and  the
    appellant could not rely on police protection.  Dr Giustozzi is of  the
    opinion that there  is  a  serious  problem  of  arbitrary  arrest  and
    detention in the country.  Access to  legal  Counsel  and  the  use  of
    warrants  and  bail  are  inconsistently  applied.   Lengthy  pre-trial
    detention remains common as does detention even after an individual  is
    found innocent.  Bribery is also widely reported.

15.   Dr Giustozzi deals with the threat from  extremist  Islamic  movements
    and individuals and states that from 2003 there have been a  number  of
    cases  of  attacks  on  individuals  accused  of  being   converts   to
    Christianity, mostly by Taliban guerrillas.  The  US  State  Department
    Religious Freedom Report of 2005 reports the killing of at  least  five
    converts that was reported in the press.  The Taliban had also  claimed
    that two NGO workers were killed by them in 2003  and  that  they  were
    involved in proselytising.  He was unable to say  whether  these  cases
    involved genuine conversions but in his view the fact that the  Taliban
    publicised the executions showed that they hoped to gain support  among
    the population by showing their contempt for converts.  He was  of  the
    view that it was possible that other murders  of  apostates  had  taken
    place in remote parts of the country, without being reported in Kabul.

16.   Dr Giustozzi states that the population's hostility  towards  converts
    runs very high and  extends  well  beyond  the  Islamic  fundamentalist
    circles.  Afghan Christians are reported to live in fear of attacks  by
    extremists, even outside the areas of influence of Taliban  insurgents.
    This hostility has been worsening over the summer of 2006 as  a  result
    of growing xenophobia among the Afghan population in  the  wake  of  an
    attempt by a South Korean evangelical Christian group  to  celebrate  a
    "peace festival" in Afghanistan.  The Afghan government was  forced  to
    deport hundreds of South Koreans following protests and threats.

17.   Dr Giustozzi describes  one  personal  example  of  hostility  towards
    converts when he was staying in Kunduz as a Political  Affairs  Officer
    for UNAMA.  In early 2004 he received complaints by  locals  about  the
    activities of two South Korean Christian  NGOs,  who  were  accused  of
    trying to convert Afghans to  Christianity  by  distributing  religious
    material.  He was warned that some action might be taken and warned the
    two NGOs and their staff, although he left Kunduz shortly afterwards so
    was not able to follow up the outcome of this incident.

18.   He also describes the incident in July 2007 when a group of  23  South
    Korean missionaries arrived in Afghanistan.  An official from  Kandahar
    Airport informed a Taliban commander of their presence  and  they  were
    captured on the highway in Ghanzi Province.  He opines that news of the
    appellant's  conversion  is  very  likely  spreading  from  the  Afghan
    diaspora in the UK to Afghanistan, given the evidence that at least two
    returnees are aware of his conversion.  When the appellant  returns  he
    would have to urgently look for a job and accommodation, both of  which
    would prevent him from hiding in order to avoid detection.  He would be
    asked for references and information about his place of origin and  his
    family background.  If he failed to provide those  details  that  would
    hamper his chances of finding a job or a place to live and Dr Giustozzi
    states that employers and  landlords  are  able  to  check  information
    through networks of acquaintances and regularly do so.  His  background
    would eventually be checked and  his  whereabouts  would  therefore  be
    known and he would be exposed  to  the  risk  of  targeting  by  Muslim
    zealots and possibly the Afghan security agencies too.

19.   Dr Giustozzi was unable to say whether there was any  real  risk  that
    the appellant's family might report him to the judiciary.  However  the
    fact that his son no longer has any  contact  with  him  suggests  that
    denouncing his father to the police could be an option.  This  is  what
    had happened in the Abdul Rahman case who was reported to the police by
    his own family and the Bah�'� had also been denounced by his own wife.

20.   He states  that  the  Afghan  judiciary  remains  dominated  by  ultra
    conservatives.  It could not be taken for granted the  appellant  would
    be given a fair trial.  The State Attorney still has the right to  send
    individuals for trial by the Special Security Court and in those  cases
    no Counsel is available and the trial is held in secret.   He  cites  a
    further example of a journalist, Syed Perwiz Kambakhsh who was  accused
    of blasphemy and was sentenced to death in Mazar-I  Sharif  in  January
    2008 by the Special Security Court in a secret trial where  he  had  no
    access to Counsel.  President Karzai has refused to  intervene  in  the
    case despite appeals by multiple sources  in  Afghanistan  and  abroad.
    His crime was to distribute copies of an article commenting  on  verses
    of the Koran about women.

The Oral Testimony of Dr Giustozzi

21.   Dr Giustozzi adopted his report.  He told us details  of  the  persons
    with whom he has contact in Afghanistan.  He repeated his evidence that
    no Afghan Christian would be able to practise  their  faith  openly  in
    Afghanistan.  He told us there were no official churches; that the only
    church in the country was at the Italian Embassy where Afghans were not
    allowed to practise.  A convert would only  be  able  to  practise  his
    faith underground, however if that was known to the public it would  be
    highly problematic.

22.   In relation to underground networks of Christians, Dr  Giustozzi  said
    that it was widely assumed that such organisations existed.  They  were
    probably more common in Kabul than anywhere else; however  he  had  not
    been able to detect any such network.  He  had  only  come  across  one
    single Afghan convert to Christianity who had not  provided  any  other
    information about other converts or networks.

23.   He thought the appellant would  have  to  meet  and  worship  secretly
    because there were no churches although it would be possible for houses
    to be used for meetings. However, he would have  to  be  careful  about
    proselytising and about  revealing  his  beliefs  to  his  friends  and
    relatives or anybody.  Even  if  he  worshiped  underground  there  was
    definitely a risk if either the appellant or the network  he  was  with
    tried to proselytise.  Dr Giustozzi was aware that the appellant's  son
    knew that he had converted and he thought that the best chance for  the
    appellant to live in Kabul undetected would be if a sympathiser  hosted
    him and protected him by giving him accommodation and food.  However he
    would still not be able to openly  practise  his  faith  but  in  those
    circumstances he did not think he would be detected unless the  network
    itself was detected for some reason.  Dr Giustozzi did  not  think  the
    appellant faced  a  high  risk  of  being  recognised  because  of  his
    pronounced stoop: he was not originally from Kabul; it was a large city
    with a population of five million.  If the appellant was able  to  live
    in a neighbourhood away from where he originally lived and he had  been
    away for a while the chances of him  being  recognised  were  not  very
    high.  The appellant would however have to look for  accommodation  and
    employment and Dr Giustozzi did not know if he could easily find  work.
    Accommodation is expensive.  There is an issue as to how he would  cope
    financially.  Even assuming he could work the problem would be that  if
    he found a job the chances of him being detected  would  be  that  much
    higher.  People would ask for references and he would have  to  contact
    people who used to know him such as employees,  friends  and  landlords
    and the information that he was present in Afghanistan would  start  to
    spread.  Dr Giustozzi was of the opinion that  the  appellant  was  not
    likely to meet someone he knew from his home area in Kabul  because  it
    is such a large city or at the very least he was certainly not going to
    bump into someone that he knew everyday but clearly the more  often  he
    went out into the community the greater that risk would be.   He  would
    essentially have to live in hiding.

24.   He said that the Afghan people were quite  conservative  and  strongly
    religious and most favourable to the application of  Islamic  law.   He
    explained about Article 1(30) of the Constitution to which we  referred
    earlier.  He said there was some debate in Afghanistan about the likely
    constitutional protection from the death  penalty  for  apostasy.   The
    judiciary are of the view that Islamic law applies however some lawyers
    train abroad  and  have  rejected  this  interpretation.   However  the
    interpretation so far  has  been  in  the  direction  of  allowing  the
    application of Islamic law in these cases.  He said the Rahman case  is
    unique insofar as it is the only one which has been brought  to  public
    attention.  He said there were other cases:  he could  personally  only
    identify three others but they had been dealt with  discreetly  by  the
    authorities.  In two of the cases he was not sure what happened to  the
    converts who had been arrested by the police.  In the  third  case  the
    Attorney General decided not to prosecute for  political  reasons.   It
    was unique that that case was publicly  discussed.   It  was  rare  for
    criminal cases in Afghanistan to be discussed in public.  There  was  a
    tendency to try people charged with this type  of  offence  in  special
    courts because they were believed to be less corrupt and it was  faster
    and more controllable by the government.  He said there were  very  few
    converts to Christianity in Afghanistan and that they mostly  lived  in
    the cities. There were only  a  few  living  in  the  villages  and  Dr
    Giustozzi did not think there were a lot of cases  where  converts  had
    been discovered there.  He said that increasingly criminal  cases  were
    not in any event referred to the courts: people  went  to  clerics  who
    applied a very conservative interpretation of Islamic law.  He did  not
    know of any such cases personally.  He said he was only able to comment
    that there had been reports of killings  of  converts  and  individuals
    accused of proselytising by the Taliban.  The Taliban had recently made
    these claims.  The case of the NGO worker  Gail  Williams  was  one  in
    point:  she  and  her  organisation  had  been  accused  of  trying  to
    proselytise among the Afghans.  The kidnapping of the 23  South  Korean
    NGO workers in Southern Afghanistan, was justified on  the  basis  that
    they were involved in  proselytising  and  two  of  those  people  were
    executed.

25.   Dr Giustozzi said that if it became known that a man had converted  to
    Christianity in Afghanistan it was likely to spread widely.  What would
    happen to that individual would depend on where he was and how  far  he
    was from his original community but it would at least  be  reported  to
    the police.  He repeated  his  evidence  that  he  did  not  think  the
    President would want to attract  adverse  publicity  particularly  when
    there were elections in 2009.  Since the case of Rahman  and  the  fact
    that he was allowed out of the country, public opinion had become  more
    conservative.  He thought  the  President  would  be  thinking  of  his
    chances of being re-elected if he prevented the judiciary from applying
    strict Islamic law: however he remained  under  pressure  from  foreign
    governments.  He thought it would be very difficult for  the  President
    to help in the future, however, if  a  convert  came  into  the  public
    domain in Afghanistan he thought foreign  governments  might  still  be
    proactive but he did not think the President would intervene.   In  the
    last few months he had made a number of statements to show hostility to
    excessive foreign influence in the country.  He thought it  likely  the
    President would try to prevent such cases from coming into  the  public
    domain.  He was not sure if he had intervened in the three  cases  that
    he knew about after the case of Rahman.

Cross-Examination

26.   Dr Giustozzi stated that he was not aware of any  cases  in  the  last
    five to ten years of the death penalty being carried out in relation to
    an apostate.  There were allegations that  there  had  been  executions
    carried out in the villages.  This would have  been  through  customary
    law i.e. from the local population going to mullahs for the application
    of Islamic law or in some parts of the country they would  use  Taliban
    courts.  He obtained this information  from  the  US  State  Department
    Report covering human rights in Afghanistan.  Essentially the  evidence
    was that when such executions were carried out the government  did  not
    intervene.  He thought it was not  likely  the  government  would  know
    about  such  cases  because  much  of  the  country  was  very   remote
    particularly in the mountainous  regions.   Anything  could  happen  in
    these areas: it was not likely to be reported as there was nobody there
    largely  to  report  the  facts.   He  personally  received  a  lot  of
    information about incidents of executions or disappearances  which  was
    very difficult to verify.  He thought this was the likely basis of  the
    information in the US State Department Report.  He could not  speculate
    on what had happened to the person who had been arrested  for  apostasy
    that he had mentioned in his report i.e.  in  addition  to  Rahman  and
    thought  he  had  probably  been  released  under  pressure  from   the
    government trying to avoid the case reaching the courts  but  that  was
    speculative on his part.   In  relation  to  the  raids  on  houses  of
    suspected apostates, Dr Giustozzi said that his understanding was  that
    houses were searched for evidence but he was not aware of any  arrests.
    He said the Christian convert who had been arrested in  the  summer  of
    2007 had been released  because  of  political  considerations  and  he
    understood this to be in Kabul but was not  completely  certain.   This
    was what a political officer had told him at the time.   After  he  had
    written his report the Attorney  General  resigned  from  his  job  and
    announced that he was a candidate in the general elections.   This  led
    Dr  Giustozzi  to  think  that  there   might   have   been   political
    considerations in the release of this man because the Attorney  General
    wanted to retain the support of the Western  embassies.   He  described
    how the President  would  have  to  play  a  game  of  brinkmanship  in
    balancing public opinion against the need not to compromise the support
    of the American Embassy.

27.   Dr Giustozzi agreed that his opinion that  suspected  apostates  would
    not be handed over to the Afghan authorities now but would be  executed
    outright was speculative but there was a general trend not to go to the
    judiciary, mainly because of corruption and because they were  seen  as
    not serving the population he accepted however, that was  his  opinion.
    He thought that the numbers of Christians living in Afghanistan must be
    in the low thousands but it was not possible for him  to  be  accurate.
    He was referred to an article published in the Sunday  Telegraph  dated
    March 26 2006 concerning the Rahman case in which the author had spoken
    to a Christian convert in Kabul. The report stated that  up  to  10,000
    Afghans had secretly converted to Christianity  in  recent  years.   Dr
    Giustozzi said that the report also indicated that a substantial number
    had  left  the  country  or  converted  abroad.   The  interviewee  had
    mentioned that there were churches in Kabul; however Dr Giustozzi  said
    there were no official churches.   What  would  happen  is  that  these
    individuals would find a place or perhaps a private house and call it a
    church but it would not be recognisable as a  church,  it  was  just  a
    place to meet.

28.   Dr Giustozzi said his evidence as to the need for landlords to  obtain
    references whenever anybody wanted to rent accommodation was  based  on
    his own experience in Afghanistan.  He had been asked  for  references.
    He said it was all down to the need to protect the landlords' interests
    because there were many cases of illegal occupation of flats  in  Kabul
    that were still to be sorted out.  He conceded however that the biggest
    risk to a convert would be actual proselytising and  that  could  apply
    not just to the individual but to anyone connected to him and the whole
    network of Christians could be uncovered.  He agreed  that  there  were
    very few examples of individuals proselytising in Kabul or  Afghanistan
    as a whole.  He said many of these conversions took place not on Afghan
    soil.  In most cases the whole family  would  convert  to  Christianity
    because it was much easier to live in that way.

29.   Dr Giustozzi told the Tribunal that the  first  Christian  conversions
    began in the 1960s when Afghanistan started to open  up.   Before  that
    there were no Christians in  Afghanistan.   Any  native  Christian  now
    would be the son or daughter of someone who had converted at that time.
     He accepted there could be some innate  Christians  but  the  majority
    would be converts.  He was also of the opinion that not  only  would  a
    convert have to avoid detection by fasting  during  Ramadan  ,he  would
    also have to ignore the Christian festivals and celebrations; he  would
    have to work on Christmas Day and would of course have to abstain  from
    any proselytising.  He repeated his evidence that he did not personally
    know of any executions on the grounds of apostasy although he did  know
    of some as the result of adultery or homicide.  He clarified that  even
    if the appellant did  not  attend  the  local  mosque  that  would  not
    necessarily single him out as many people did not attend the mosque  to
    worship.  Dr Giustozzi also said that he  believed  that  most  of  the
    people who would have converted to Christianity in the 1960s and  1970s
    would have left the country.  He confirmed that there  were  definitely
    no open apostates in Afghanistan.

30.   Dr Giustozzi confirmed that he also  continued  to  rely  on  what  is
    recorded at paragraph 134 of the Tribunal's decision in PM  and  Others
    as to the nature of Afghanistan society.  It is helpful if  we  set  it
    out as follows:

        "134.    The risk, according to Dr Giustozzi, would arise after  a
             period following their return.  He argues that  it  is  in  the
             nature of Afghanistan society that relationships are  based  on
             trust  and  that  for  the  appellants  to   obtain   work   or
             accommodation  they  would  need  to  reveal  something   about
             themselves to their prospective employer or landlord.  He  said
             that  would  give  rise  to  checks  being  made   into   their
             background.  He said that is easier now,  with  the  advent  of
             mobile phones and other communications, and  that  their  pasts
             would become apparent.  It would not thereafter take  long  for
             the people and therefore the authorities to  hear  about  them.
             Not only would the authorities hear about them,  through  their
             sources, but it could be assumed that after a relatively  short
             number of  weeks  or  months  they  would  have  re-established
             themselves and become part of informal networks of  family  and
             friends.  Dr Giustozzi said that the security forces may  well
             then think  that  they  are  worth  interrogating,  because  of
             knowledge they may pick up from those family or friends."

Submissions

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

31.   Mr Gulvin began by reminding  the  Tribunal  that  the  appellant  had
    arrived in the United Kingdom as a passenger on the  infamous  hijacked
    plane and he had claimed asylum because he had a fear of  the  Taliban.
    It was clear from the evidence that the Tribunal cited in the  decision
    dismissing his appeal, (which is not contested by the  appellant)  that
    he worked in a hotel for fifteen years in  Kabul.   He  submitted  that
    this fact would be relevant to any issue of  internal  relocation.   It
    was now about fourteen years since the appellant had lived  there.   In
    fact when he took the hijacked plane he was on a visit  to  Kabul  from
    his home village.  The appellant has a stoop which is thought to be  of
    some significance because it marks  him  out;  however  it  had  to  be
    remembered that he had been afflicted with this for a number  of  years
    and yet he had worked at times in Kabul.  The appellant also claimed to
    be aged around 60.

32.   Mr Gulvin conceded that the appellant had  developed  an  interest  in
    the Christian religion whilst he was in the United Kingdom and  it  was
    accepted by the Secretary of State and the Immigration  Judge  that  he
    had converted.  If the appellant went back to Afghanistan he would have
    to go to a place where to be openly Christian is not possible.  However
    it was clear from the objective evidence and confirmed by Dr  Giustozzi
    that there are Christians in  Afghanistan  possibly  numbering  in  the
    thousands. They have to operate underground but there  is  nevertheless
    Christianity in Afghanistan.  Mr Gulvin  accepted  that  the  appellant
    could not be expected to act in a particular way which would  adversely
    affect his very being i.e. if he had to worship  underground,  keep  to
    himself and live  his  life,  faith  and  undertake  worship  privately
    however the essential question here was how the appellant would in fact
    behave.  His  activities  in  the  United  Kingdom  would  need  to  be
    considered.  It was clear from the letter from Dr and Mrs Freeman  that
    had been taken into account by the Immigration Judge that the appellant
    was a man who takes Christianity seriously  and  he  had  made  it  his
    business to spread  Christianity  to  other  Afghans  in  the  UK.   He
    submitted that paragraph 2 of their letter gave an  indication  of  how
    the appellant might behave.  In the letter Dr and Mrs  Freeman  say  as
    follows:

        "2. [M] continues to experience hostility  from  Muslims  who  take
             exception to his Christian faith.   During  festivals  such  as
             Ramadan he has experienced difficulty in visiting our home  and
             has had to walk a long way around to avoid being seen by  those
             attending the mosque, as he was himself was not attending.   He
             is conscious that there  are  people  who  want  to  cause  him
             trouble and so tries to 'keep his head down' wherever possible.
              He used to be concerned about people looking through the  open
             church door and recognising him, for example, but now  he  says
             that Jesus helps him feel strong."

      Mr Gulvin submitted that this was exactly what the appellant would  do
    in Afghanistan: he would keep his head down and avoid trouble.  It  was
    open to him to live in Kabul because he had lived there for a period of
    time; he had not heard from his family and does  not  keep  in  contact
    with them and there was no need for him to go back to  his  home  area.
    Five million people lived in  Kabul.   The  appellant  was  capable  of
    employment  as  he  had  clearly  done  different  jobs  in  the  past.
    Generally it was recognised that  Kabul  was  a  place  where  internal
    relocation was possible.  It is not disputed that conditions  in  Kabul
    would not violate the appellant's Article 3 rights.

33.   He submitted that there would be no real risk from the two people  who
    had gone back to Kabul who knew about his conversion.  The  appellant's
    fears in relation to them were speculative.

34.   Mr Gulvin submitted that on the facts of this particular case  it  was
    the respondent's position that the appellant could return and  practise
    his Christian faith because it was likely that he would keep  his  head
    down.  It was possible he would find likeminded people in Kabul because
    it appears that there is a significant if small  underground  Christian
    community.  Mr Gulvin  was  unable  to  inform  the  Tribunal  how  the
    appellant would establish contact with such  people.   There  was  very
    limited evidence as to  what  happened  to  apostates  when  they  were
    discovered.  He accepted that if the appellant engaged in proselytising
    then he did face a real risk.  However it remained the case that  there
    was a lack of evidence of any problems for apostates and certainly none
    from the government.   He  submitted  that  in  reality  there  was  no
    evidence apart from  the  Rahman  case  that  there  had  been  serious
    problems for apostates in Afghanistan.  He submitted that at  most  the
    appellant could establish  that  there  was  a  possibility,  no  more,
    certainly not a real risk that he would be targeted as a  convert.   He
    accepted  he  would  have  to  live  his  private  life  in   difficult
    circumstances but rejected any submission that this would  violate  the
    appellant's Article 8 or 9 rights under the ECHR.

Submissions on behalf of the Appellant

35.   Mr Jacobs relied on the skeleton he had prepared for the Tribunal  and
    which we have summarised  where  necessary.   Mr  Jacobs  said  it  was
    particularly relevant that in this case the  appellant  was  a  genuine
    convert; he was a known apostate  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  was  a
    committed Christian.  If anyone was likely to be recognised it was this
    appellant because he was bent double with his  back  problem.   He  had
    attained some notoriety because he was  a  passenger  on  the  hijacked
    plane that came to the United Kingdom.  He said that the appellant  was
    not able to return to his home area.  He had received  threats  at  the
    hostel where he was staying in the United Kingdom and there had been an
    angry reaction from local Muslims when Dr Freeman had come  to  collect
    him to go to church.  The evidence that the  appellant  had  given  was
    that his son had called him from Afghanistan and  had  stopped  contact
    with him on finding that he  had  changed  his  religion.   He  had  no
    contact with his daughter and she could not in any event be expected to
    provide him with any protection.  The evidence was that the appellant's
    family knew about his conversion.  The Immigration Judge had received a
    letter after the hearing in which a written submission  was  made  that
    the appellant was known in his local area and to which he had  referred
    at paragraph 11 of his determination.  He submitted that the  appellant
    was at risk in his home area and could not return there.  He noted from
    paragraph 11 of the Immigration Judge's determination  that  there  was
    evidence  before  him  that  after  the  Rahman  case  there  had  been
    demonstrations in the city  of  Mazar-i-Sharif  in  which  people  were
    shouting "Death to Christians!" and "Death to America!"  This  was  the
    appellant's home town.

36.   Mr Jacobs addressed the Tribunal as to  whether  the  appellant  could
    safely return to Kabul.  He said it was accepted that it  was  fourteen
    years since the appellant had last been to Kabul.  He was working at  a
    hotel in Kabul at the time the Taliban accused him of  selling  alcohol
    and arrested him.  It was the case that if he could  be  provided  with
    accommodation and food on return and if he did not engage in activities
    that might bring him to the attention of the authorities  he  might  be
    able to slip under  the  net.   However  he  would  have  to  look  for
    accommodation and work on return.  He would have no support network  in
    Kabul.  He submitted it would be impossible for the appellant to find a
    Christian  network  because  they  were  very  secretive  about   their
    existence because of the extent  of  the  threat  against  them.   This
    evidence was indicative that the appellant would be living in hiding as
    a member of a persecuted group and he submitted that it followed  there
    was a real risk of persecution if he was discovered.  The Tribunal  had
    accepted his evidence in previous  cases.   In  order  to  survive  the
    appellant would be required to have links with others, he would need to
    find some person he could trust.

37.   Mr Jacobs said it was accepted that there was a real  risk  to  anyone
    who proselytised the Christian faith.  In fact it would be suicidal for
    him to openly proselytise.  The appellant had kept his head down in the
    United Kingdom because there were people here  who  knew  what  he  was
    doing.  This would not apply in Afghanistan because the appellant would
    not be in a position of being able to keep his head  down  and  in  any
    event he would have to pretend that he was a Muslim.  He would have  to
    fast.  He would not be able to celebrate any  Christian  festival.   He
    would have to look over his shoulder  at  all  times  in  case  he  was
    recognised.  Background evidence showed the government did not want  to
    get involved.  Mr Jacobs said the appellant was not at  risk  from  the
    government or the judiciary as such but could  not  look  to  them  for
    protection.  He submitted that the recent case of  Kambakhsh,  referred
    to by Dr Giustozzi in his report indicated that  matters  were  getting
    worse for apostates because the President was now committed to becoming
    more conservative.  This would enable the  judiciary  to  take  a  more
    conservative approach in the  knowledge  that  the  President  was  not
    likely to intervene.

38.   Mr Jacobs said it was common ground between the  parties  that  to  be
    openly Christian was not possible.  It was not enough to  say  that  he
    would be able to avoid detection particularly since  the  police  could
    not  protect  him  if  it  became  known  that  he  was  a  convert  in
    Afghanistan.  He  submitted  it  was  simply  not  reasonable  for  the
    appellant to be expected to modify his  behaviour  in  this  particular
    case.

39.   Mr Jacobs referred the  Tribunal  to  the  comments  of  Lord  Justice
    Sedley in MT (Afghanistan) [2008] EWCA Civ 65 at paragraphs 14  and  15
    where he said that because of the Rahman case it clearly  was  possible
    at the material time on the facts of MT  for  a  Christian  convert  in
    Afghanistan to be tried and  sentenced  to  death  for  apostasy  by  a
    shariat court.  His execution had been avoided because the President at
    the time was willing to challenge the religious  extremists  and  there
    had been international pressure on him.  However what required  further
    careful analysis on the background materials was whether what  happened
    in the Rahman case could happen again i.e. that there could be  similar
    persecution on religious grounds and  that  similar  inhuman  treatment
    might await other apostates, especially those who evangelised.

40.   Mr Jacobs said that the Rahman case was not  isolated  it  was  simply
    very public.  There were the other three cases referred to  by  the  UN
    Secretary General and the other evidence of raids of the households  of
    suspected apostates.

41.   He turned to two BBC news internet  articles  dated  21  October  2008
    relied on by the respondent.  The first reported on the  abduction  and
    the sentence of Kambakhsh, who had  been  convicted  of  blasphemy  for
    downloading material from the internet on women's rights in Islam.  His
    controversial death sentence was commuted to twenty years in jail at an
    appeal court in Kabul.  The report states that the appellant's  brother
    had criticised the President for not intervening to pardon his  brother
    Kambakhsh.  The second is a report about  the  murder  of  the  British
    volunteer Gail Williams.  The report indicates  that  the  Taliban  had
    admitted killing her for  spreading  Christianity.   As  a  result  the
    offices of the aid agency for which she worked had  been  closed  down.
    Mr Jacobs then referred the Tribunal in more detail to  the  background
    material on which he relies and we deal with this below.

Background Material before the Tribunal

42.   Article 2, Chapter 1 of the Constitution of Afghanistan, at pages  35-
    70 of the appellant's bundle, states:

        "The religion of the state of the Islamic Republic  of  Afghanistan
        is the sacred religion of Islam.


        Followers of other religions are free to exercise their  faith  and
        perform their religious rites within the provisions of law.

          Article 3, Chapter 1 states:


        "In Afghanistan,  no  law  can  be  contrary  to  the  beliefs  and
        provisions of the sacred religion of Islam."

43.   The respondent's Operational Guidance Note  on  Afghanistan  published
    on 20 April 2007,  which  is  the  current  Guidance  Note  deals  with
    converts to Christianity at Section 3.13.  We note the following:

        "3.13.2  Treatment.  Although Article 2 of  the  2004  Constitution
               states that the followers of other  religions  are  free  to
               exercise their  faith  and  perform  their  religious  rites
               within the limits of the provisions of law,  the  boundaries
               of the law are open  to  interpretation.   The  Constitution
               makes no specific provision for converts and  guarantees  of
               religious freedom generally would appear to  be  subject  to
               the constitutional catch-all that 'no law can be contrary to
               the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of Islam.'


        3.13.3   Conversion  from  Islam  is  considered  apostasy  and  is
               punishable  by  death  under  Shari'a.   However,  the   new
               constitution makes no reference to Shari'a,  and  Article  7
               commits the state to abide by the international treaties and
               conventions that require  protection  of  this  right.   The
               judicial system  in  Afghanistan  is  largely  comprised  of
               conservative Islamic judges  who  follow  Hanafi  or  Jafari
               doctrines  recommending  execution  for  converted  Muslims,
               however, there are no recently reported cases of any  Afghan
               being executed by court order for  conversion  or  apostasy.
               This is possibly because converts will tend to keep  a  very
               low profile and small communities  of  Afghan  converts  are
               believed to practice Christianity in secrecy.


        3.13.4   In March 2006, Abdul Rahman was charged and tried in Kabul
               for converting from Islam to  Christianity  and  could  have
               faced the death penalty unless he re-converted.   Mr  Rahman
               actually converted sixteen years earlier, but he came to the
               attention of  the  authorities  when  his  estranged  family
               denounced him in a custody dispute over  his  two  children.
               Following  increasing  pressure   from   the   international
               community and intervention from President  Karzai,  however,
               Abdul Rahman's case was reviewed by the judiciary and he was
               deemed mentally unfit to  stand  trial.   Abdul  Rahman  was
               subsequently freed from prison and the United Nations helped
               arrange his emigration to Italy where he was granted asylum.
                In September 2006, the UN Secretary-General  reported  that
               following the case of Abdul Rahman  there  have  been  three
               similar cases in  which  Afghan  citizens  were  accused  of
               apostasy by local religious leaders and were forced to leave
               the country.


        3.13.5   There has been a great deal of speculation about the level
               of societal discrimination which apostates would face and in
               2005 there were some unconfirmed reports  that  converts  to
               Christianity were threatened and  even  killed.   Immigrants
               and non-citizens are free to worship  in  private  locations
               and Christian affiliated international relief  organisations
               generally   operate   throughout   the    country    without
               interference.  What evidence there  is  tends  to  point  to
               proselytising being the  greater  risk  than  conversion  in
               itself, however, there was  some  publicly  displayed  anger
               over Abdul Rahman's release from prison in March 2006 and it
               was reported that around one thousand  people  protested  in
               the Northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif with calls for him to be
               tried  and  executed.   Abdul  Rahman's  release  was   also
               criticised by the leader of the lower house  of  parliament,
               Yunus Qanuni and Chief Justice Fazl Hadi Shinwar."

44.   At paragraph 3.13.7 of the Guidance it states:

        "Where the treatment feared is at  the  hands  of  the  state,  the
        question of sufficiency of protection  does  not  arise.   However,
        even  where  the  claimants  fear  is  of  societal   or   nonstate
        persecution, given Islamic law on  apostasy  and  the  conservative
        Islamic nature of the Afghan judiciary, apostates may reasonably be
        unwilling due to the state's  position  on  apostasy  to  seek  the
        protection of the Afghan authorities.  Therefore, in  either  case,
        sufficient protection should not be considered to be available  for
        apostates in Afghanistan."

45.   The Tribunal was referred to the UNHCR's  eligibility  guidelines  for
    assessing the international protection needs of Afghan  asylum  seekers
    dated December 2007 and published 3 January 2008.  The UNHCR  considers
    that internal flight or relocation for  those  fleeing  persecution  or
    generalised violence is generally not available  in  Afghanistan.   The
    report comments on support structures within Afghan society as follows:

        "Extended family and community structures within Afghan society are
        the  predominant  means  of  obtaining  protection   and   economic
        survival, including access to  accommodation.   Thus,  it  is  very
        unlikely that Afghans would be able to  lead  a  relatively  normal
        life without undue hardship upon relocation to  an  area  to  which
        they have no effective links,  including  in  urban  areas  of  the
        country."

      Later in the same report under the heading "Freedom of Religion",  the
    report states:

        "The constitution defers to Sharia Law  for  issues  on  which  the
        constitution or the penal code are silent (such as  conversion  and
        blasphemy).  As such, conversion from Islam is considered apostasy,
        and is, under some interpretations of  Sharia  Law,  punishable  by
        death.


        The imprisonment of Abdul Rahman reflects  concerns  regarding  the
        tensions between sharia and statutory laws,  the  capacity  of  the
        judiciary, the role of clerics in the judiciary and the application
        of the  death  penalty.   He  was  imprisoned  in  March  2006  for
        converting from Islam to Christianity and threatened with the death
        sentence.  Abdul Rahman was later released on findings  and  mental
        instability and granted asylum in  Italy.   Conservative  religious
        clerics organised a demonstration of over 700 protestors in Mazar-e-
        Sharif calling for  Rahman's  death  and  denouncing  international
        involvement in the case.


        According to the report of the UN Secretary General, following  the
        highly publicised case of  Abdul  Rahman,  there  have  been  three
        similar cases of harassment of Afghan Christians.  In  two  of  the
        cases, Afghan families in which some of the members  had  converted
        to Christianity reported being  harassed  by  their  community  and
        eventually decided to leave  the  country.   In  a  third  case,  a
        Christian convert was jailed on unrelated allegations of  homicide.
        While in jail, another inmate who came to  know  of  his  religious
        belief reportedly killed him.


        Although not strictly forbidden by the constitution or other  laws,
        proselytism is viewed by the authorities and society in general  as
        contrary to tenets of Islam.  As such, it is practised  discreetly.
        In August 2006, 1,000 members of a South Korean Christian aid group
        were deported from Afghanistan after Islamic clerics  accused  them
        of trying to convert Muslims to Christianity."

46.   The report makes it  clear  that  the  UNHCR  accepts  that  Christian
    converts do face a risk of  persecution.   At  paragraph  4  under  the
    heading "Considerations concerning Inclusion for Refugee  Status  under
    the 1951 Convention Criteria" and the sub-heading "Converts from  Islam
    to other Faiths" it states:

        "As explained in the section on freedom of religion in this  paper,
        the  constitution  of  Afghanistan  is  silent  on  the  issues  of
        conversion and while calling for the respective  human  rights  and
        fundamental  freedoms,  defers  to  Sharia  Law  for  matters   not
        explicitly dealt with  by  the  constitution.   Under  Sharia  Law,
        conversion  is  punishable  by  death.   As  such,  the   risk   of
        persecution continues to exist for Afghans suspected or accused  of
        having converted to Christianity or other faiths."

47.   The Tribunal was referred to the annual report of  the  United  States
    Commission on International  Religious  Freedom  dated  May  2008.   At
    paragraph 163 under the heading of "Afghanistan" one of  the  countries
    on  the  Commission's  watch  list,  the  report  addresses   the   new
    constitution adopted in Afghanistan in January 2004 and the  fact  that
    it does provide for the freedom of non-Muslim groups to exercise  their
    various faiths.  It contains no explicit protection  to  the  right  of
    freedom of religion or belief and would  extend  to  every  individual,
    including individual Muslims  who  are  the  overwhelming  majority  of
    Afghanistan's population.  The report comments on this as follows:

        "The absence of a guarantee of the individual  right  to  religious
        freedom and the  inclusion  of  a  judicial  system  instructed  to
        enforce Islamic principles  and  Islamic  law  mean  that  the  new
        constitution  does  not  protect  individual  Afghan  citizens  who
        dissent from state-imposed orthodoxy against unjust accusations  or
        religious 'crimes' such as apostasy or blasphemy."

      The report then goes on to quote the examples, which the Tribunal  has
    already detailed above of the cases of Kambakhsh and Abdul Rahman.

48.   The report further states:

        "In May 2007, the General Directorate of Fatwas and Accounts  under
        the Supreme Court issued a ruling  on  the  status  of  the  Bah�'�
        religion and  declared  it  distinct  from  Islam  and  a  form  of
        blasphemy.  The ruling also noted that Bah�'�s would  therefore  be
        treated similarly to Christians and Jews.  According to  the  State
        Department,  while  the  ruling  is  not  expected  to  affect  the
        expatriate Bah�'�s in Afghanistan, it may create problems  for  the
        country's tiny Bah�'�  community,  primarily  in  issues  involving
        marriage.  Many Afghan Bah�'�s are married to Afghan  Muslims,  and
        the ruling could  invalidate  those  marriages.   Converts  to  the
        Bah�'� religion would face the same consequences as other  converts
        from Islam."

      Later in the report it details the concerns the Commission has  raised
    about the deteriorating conditions for freedom of  religion  or  belief
    and other human rights in Afghanistan, which the Tribunal noted.

49.   The Tribunal was  referred  to  the  US  Commission  on  International
    Religious Freedom, "Anti-Conversion Laws and Religious Freedom in South
    Asia and the Middle East: The Case of Abdul Rahman" and  the  testimony
    by Felice D.Gaer, the Vice Chair of the  United  States  Commission  on
    International  Religious  Freedom  on   7   April   2006   before   the
    Congressional Human Rights Caucus.  The Tribunal has noted his evidence
    to the Caucus and his opinion that the Abdul Rahman case points to  the
    weak state of human rights protections in Afghanistan and his view that
    cases such as that of Abdul Rahman  will  continue  to  be  treated  in
    Afghanistan as criminal acts meriting the most severe punishment.

50.   The Tribunal was referred to paragraphs 19.24-19.35 of the Country  of
    Origin Report on Afghanistan dated 29 August 2008.  This  repeats  much
    of the  evidence  that  the  Tribunal  has  already  cited  above.   At
    paragraph 9.19.26 the Report states:

         "19.26   The Foreign and  Commonwealth  Office  (FCO)  noted  in  a
               letter dated 17 March 2008 that practising  Christianity  in
               Afghanistan is considered extremely  dangerous  and  is  not
               discussed openly.  However, in  Kabul  there  may  be  small
               pockets of Afghan Christians who risk worshiping together in
               secret places.


         19.27    The FCO further  noted  that  Christianity  is  still  not
               accepted.  Christians are  regularly  discriminated  against
               and face verbal and physical  abuse  from  the  authorities,
               former friends and also family members.  Authorities do  not
               generally investigate  allegations  of  harassment  or  ill-
               treatment or bring those responsible to justice."


51.   At paragraph 19.33 the Report states:

        "On  22  March  2006,  Radio  Free  Europe/Radio  Liberty  (RFE/RL)
             reported that:


        'The constitution also provides little  legal  guidance  about  how
        other faiths can live or operate in this Islamic  republic.   While
        followers of other religions enjoy the  right  to  freely  exercise
        'their faith and perform their religious rites  within  the  limits
        and the provisions  of  law,'  neither  the  constitution  nor  the
        country's law set those limits.  For example, there is no law  that
        makes it clear whether a church can operate in  the  country.   The
        unstated understanding seems to be that churches can operate inside
        diplomatic missions or in military bases but not publicly.'"

52.   At paragraph 19.34 it states:

        "On 11 September  2006,  the  UN  Secretary-General  reported  that
        following the case of Abdul Rahman in March 2006:


        'There have since been three similar cases in which Afghan citizens
        were accused of apostasy by local religious leaders and were forced
        to leave the country.  Those cases highlight the obstacles  to  the
        enjoyment of freedom of  conscience  and  religion  that  exist  in
        Afghanistan and the necessity of the Government to  take  proactive
        measures to protect those rights.  In that regard, the proposal  to
        reinstate the Department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention
        of Vice within the Ministry of Hajj  and  Religious  Affairs  is  a
        development that will need to be closely monitored.'"

53.   At paragraph 19.35 of the Report it details the case, recorded in  the
    UNHCR's "Eligibility Guidelines"  paper  of  2007  of  the  two  Afghan
    families who converted to Christianity and had reported being  harassed
    by their community and eventually decided to  leave  the  country.   It
    also mentioned the case of the convert who was murdered while in jail.

54.   At paragraph 32.01 of the Country of  Origin  Information  Report  the
    UNHCR guidelines on Afghans who may be at risk is considered  and  this
    includes converts from Islam to other faiths.  Quoting from this report
    it states:

        "Afghans suspected or accused of having converted from Islam to
        Christianity or other faiths risk persecution.  The risk emanates
        from family and/or tribe members as well as the broader community.
        Severe punishment within the legal system is also possible for
        those who do not recant their conversion."

55.   The Tribunal was  referred  to  the  US  Department  of  State  Report
    "International Religious Freedom Report  2008:  Afghanistan"  dated  19
    September 2008 (the International Religious Freedom Report 2008).  This
    is the most recent evidence before the Tribunal.  In  the  introduction
    to  this  report  it  states  that  non-Muslim  minority  groups  faced
    incidents of discrimination and persecution and:

        "Due to societal pressure, most local Christians hid their religion
        from others."

      At Section  2  entitled  "Status  of  Religious  Freedom"  the  Report
    mentions that although there are no laws forbidding proselytism  it  is
    viewed by many authorities  and  most  of  society  in  Afghanistan  as
    contrary to the beliefs of Islam.  The Report states  that  there  were
    unconfirmed reports of harassment of Christians thought to be  involved
    in proselytism.  Under the section headed  "Restrictions  on  Religious
    Freedom" the Report states:

        "As discussed above, under Islamic law, conversion  from  Islam  is
        punishable by death.  In recent years this sentence was not carried
        out.


        Immigrants  and  non-citizens  were  free  to  practise  their  own
        religions.  In Kabul  200  to  300  expatriates  met  regularly  at
        Christian worship services held in private  locations  due  to  the
        existence of only  one  Christian  church  in  the  country.   This
        church, located within the Diplomatic  Enclave,  was  not  open  to
        local nationals.  Buddhist foreigners  were  free  to  practise  in
        temples established for the Buddhist immigrant community.


        There are an unknown number of foreign missionaries in the  country
        who work discreetly to  avoid  harassment.   There  were  no  overt
        foreign missionaries or other  non-Islamic  religiously  orientated
        organisations  in   the   country.    Proselytism   was   practised
        discreetly, since it is viewed as  contrary  to  the  teachings  of
        Islam.  During the period covered by this report, there were a  few
        reported   incidents   involving    individuals    attempting    to
        proselytise."

       Later  under  the  same  section  the  Report  deals  with  the  Sikh
    community's schools and states that there are no  Christian  or  Jewish
    schools.

56.   Under the heading "Abuses of Religious Freedom" the Report deals  with
    the case of Syed Kambakhsh, the  details  of  which  the  Tribunal  has
    referred to earlier in the determination.  It also details the case  of
    the member of the Bah�'� faith and that of  Abdul  Rahman  and  to  the
    other cases the Tribunal has already cited above.

57.   Under the heading "Improvements and Positive Developments  in  Respect
    for Religious Freedom" the Report states that the government  continued
    to stress reconciliation and cooperation among all citizens although in
    this regard it was primarily concerned with  reconciliation  of  former
    Taliban combatants.  It has  also  expressed  concern  about  religious
    intolerance.  The Report does not identify any specific measures  taken
    by the government in this respect.

58.   Mr Jacobs  referred  the  Tribunal  to  the  decision  in  RQ  (Afghan
    National Army - Hizb-i-Islami  -  risk)  Afghanistan  CG  [2008]  UKAIT
    00013. At page 21 of the report the Tribunal quoted paragraph 28.08  of
    the COIR dated April 2007 which is a quote from  Dr  Giustozzi  in  his
    publication "Afghanistan Notes" of 28 June 2006 where he said:

        "It is not difficult to track people down in Afghanistan,  although
        it might take time.  Neighbours and landlords will  check  people's
        backgrounds, because everyone thinks in terms of security,  and  so
        they would want to check a  newcomer's  background  in  their  home
        area.  Further, messages are sent across the country via chains  of
        communications based on personal contacts, and it would be  natural
        to investigate where someone was from in order  to  see  what  role
        they  could  play  in  such  a  network.   The  postal  service  is
        unreliable and only delivers to the district centres,  not  to  the
        villages, so that travellers are often used to deliver messages and
        goods to relatives and friends."

      The Tribunal in PM accepted much of Dr Giustozzi's opinion as  to  the
    operation of this type of community  network  within  Afghanistan.   At
    paragraph 109 of  the  Tribunal's  decision  in  RQ  it  concluded,  in
    relation to internal flight, and for this purpose it is only  necessary
    to quote the following from paragraph 109:

        "The country background  evidence  did  not  as  yet  suggest  that
        domestic protection in Kabul is  sufficient  to  meet  the  Horvath
        standard  where  an  individualised   risk   exists;   the   Afghan
        authorities did not have the resources to protect individuals,  and
        ISAF's remit is generalised and not individual protection."


Our Findings

General Findings on the Expert Evidence and Background Material

59.   We start by making it clear that this decision does not deal with  the
    position for Afghans who have been Christians from birth or in  respect
    of the immigrant Christian  population  in  Afghanistan.  We  have  not
    considered in any detail any background material in  respect  of  these
    groups in Afghan society. We are concerned solely  with  assessing  the
    risk to an Afghan Christian living in  Afghanistan  who  has  converted
    from Islam, an apostate. The burden is on the  appellant  to  establish
    that he is a refugee as defined in  Regulation  2  of  the  Refugee  or
    Person in Need of international protection (Qualification)  Regulations
    2006 and that he is  entitled  to  the  grant  of  asylum  pursuant  to
    paragraph 334 of HC 395 or that there will be a violation of his  human
    rights if he is returned to Afghanistan. The standard of proof in  both
    cases is one of real risk. We have  considered  the  categorisation  of
    fundamental rights explained by Hathaway in his publication: The Law of
    Refugee Status. The  right  to  freedom  of  thought,  conscience,  and
    religion is one of the first tier rights in the hierarchy identified by
    Professor Hathaway, from which, in accordance  with  the  International
    Bill of Rights, there can be no derogation  by  the  signatory  states.
    Whilst this does not include Afghanistan it is appropriate to use  this
    as a benchmark for determining whether there is a real risk of  serious
    ill-treatment amounting to persecution or a violation of Article  3  of
    the ECHR on the established facts and background evidence in this case.
    We bear in mind  that  for  the  purpose  of  the  Refugee  Convention,
    persecution is serious ill treatment coupled with a lack  of  effective
    state protection.

60.   It is clear from  the  background  material  and  the  expert  opinion
    before us that any individual who is a Christian living in  Afghanistan
    whether he was born a Christian or is  an  immigrant  foreign  national
    working in the country or a convert  cannot  practise  their  faith  in
    public  in  Afghan  society.   There  are  no  Christian  churches   in
    Afghanistan and the evidence is that Christians either  practise  their
    faith in private i.e. when they gather together to worship, or there is
    provision for foreign nationals to worship in the  Diplomatic  enclave,
    but not Afghans.  We accept that it is reasonably likely that  most  of
    the underground networks of Christians worshipping in  Afghanistan  can
    be found in Kabul and very rarely elsewhere in the country although  we
    have noted there is no actual evidence  before  us  of  any  particular
    network operating in Kabul.  We should say at this point  that  we  are
    unable to attach any weight to the Sunday Telegraph report of March 26,
    2006 and to the recorded  conversation  with  a  Christian  convert  in
    Kabul.  We know nothing about the person who it  is  claimed  gave  the
    information that there were churches operating in Kabul and there  were
    up to 10,000 Afghans who had secretly converted to Christianity. We are
    not prepared to attach weight to a comment of this kind.   However,  we
    note that even this person is reported as saying that  the  conversions
    had been secret, which is an indicator in itself  of  the  difficulties
    that might be faced by publicising any such  conversion.  The  reported
    comment  that  there  are  churches  operating  in  Kabul  is  directly
    contradicted in the remainder of the background material before us.  We
    accept the evidence therefore that  there  are  no  Christian  churches
    openly operating anywhere in Afghanistan and that the only place  where
    Christians can worship is subject to diplomatic protection  and  is  in
    any event not  accessible for Afghans.  There is no evidence  that  the
    Afghan government has any policy of  seeking  out  those  who  actively
    practise some faith other than Islam. However, in accordance  with  the
    Constitution, although other religions are free to exercise their faith
    and perform their religious rights, it must be within the provision  of
    the law and hence the reason why Christians worshipping in  Afghanistan
    must do so in private.

The Position for Apostates in Afghanistan

61.   We turn then  to  consider  the  evidence  before  us,  which  remains
    limited, as to the position for apostates in Afghanistan.

62.   It is  clear  that  the  Afghan  Constitution  does  not  provide  any
    protection for those who abandon Islam and convert  to  another  faith.
    Under Sharia Law apostasy is considered a serious  crime  which  should
    attract the death penalty.  The Afghan Constitution as we understand it
    is completely silent on what should happen to apostates. We have  noted
    Dr  Giustozzi's  evidence  that  where  the  law  is   silent   Shariat
    jurisprudence applies, which in this case  would  mean  that  a  person
    whose conversion from Islam becomes public in Afghanistan is liable  to
    be dealt with under Sharia Law. The Tribunal in AR had no  evidence  of
    what might happen to an apostate in Afghanistan whose conversion became
    public. There is now evidence namely the case  of  Abdul  Rahman.   The
    government was clearly not able to prevent him from being  charged  and
    initially having to face the prospect of a trial  according  to  Sharia
    Law simply because he had converted to Christianity.  That it seems  to
    us was itself an act of persecution:  it was serious ill-treatment i.e.
    the deprivation of liberty and the threat of a trial  before  a  Sharia
    court and ultimately the possibility of the death penalty,  because  of
    religious belief.  President Karzai was forced to take action  in  that
    case because of international pressure and he was  able  to  secure  Mr
    Rahman's release for the reasons the  Tribunal  has  already  set  out.
    What he was not able to do however was to offer Mr Rahman any  kind  of
    protection within Afghanistan.  Mr Rahman had to be assisted  to  leave
    the country and was eventually granted asylum in Italy.  This  evidence
    demonstrates that once  it  became  known  that  he  had  converted  to
    Christianity, his life was at risk  wherever  he  went  in  Afghanistan
    because his position was not tolerated  by  fundamentalists  or  Afghan
    society in general and the government could offer no practical level of
    protection.  He was  at  risk  from  Islamic  fundamentalists  and  the
    demonstration organised by clerics following his release shows,  albeit
    on a relatively small scale, how easy it is for the fundamentalists  to
    whip up public support for their view.

63.   We have noted that much the same happened to the Baha'i  man  who  was
    arrested  again  simply  because  of  his  religion:  although  he  was
    released, he also had to leave the country because he was not safe.

64.   In respect of evidence of  any  other  cases,  many  of  the  examples
    quoted by Dr Giustozzi were not cases where he had been able to  verify
    the information he had received.  He accepted that  he  was  forced  to
    speculate in respect of the possible outcome of these  cases.  We  note
    too that some of the examples he gave  within  his  personal  knowledge
    involved  foreigners  (individuals  employed  with  NGOs)  working   in
    Afghanistan who had been accused  of  proselytising,  although  he  was
    unable to say what happened to them if anything.  These  cases  do  not
    assist in reality in respect of the position for  apostates.  The  only
    verifiable evidence that was before us of the  treatment  of  apostates
    was that of the UN Secretary General who reported  on  three  cases  of
    converts in September 2006.  In two of those cases  the  converts  were
    forced to leave the  country  and  in  the  third  the  individual  was
    murdered whilst in jail, on an  unrelated  matter,  because  it  became
    known that he was a convert.  It strikes us  that  in  none  of  theses
    cases was there an adequate level  of  protection  available  from  the
    state.

65.   It is impossible in our view to say whether in the event that  another
    individual was found to have converted from Islam in Afghanistan,  that
    the president, whoever that may be given the  elections  this  year  in
    2009, would intervene in the way that President Karzai did  in  respect
    of Abdul Rahman.  What is clear from the evidence is that any  apostate
    who is discovered to be so will not be tolerated.  In the light of  the
    lack of protection under the current Constitution and what happened  to
    Abdul Rahman when he was exposed, any such individual would face at the
    very  least  a  real  risk  of  arrest  and  detention  and  ultimately
    punishment before a  Sharia  court.   There  is  no  guarantee  of  any
    political intervention but there is a  guarantee  that  such  behaviour
    would not be tolerated, certainly by powerful  fundamentalists  in  the
    country.

66.   We do not think this is an issue as to whether or  not  an  individual
    in these circumstances is reasonably likely to be discovered on return.
     The plain fact on the evidence before us is that a  genuine  apostate,
    and here we are dealing specifically  with  conversion  from  Islam  to
    Christianity, simply would not be able to openly express his change  of
    faith without running a real risk of persecution.  The individual would
    have to keep his faith completely secret; he would have to live a  lie;
    he may be forced to forego contact with others of his faith because  of
    the danger and, significantly, would be  constantly  looking  over  his
    shoulder to avoid discovery in fear of the consequences.  In the  event
    it would matter little whether such an individual had family support or
    not;  if  discovered  the  evidence  does  show  that  there  would  be
    inadequate level of protection available from  the  Afghan  authorities
    against those who would seek to punish for  that  conversion.   In  our
    view an apostate could not reasonably be expected to tolerate living in
    this way in Afghanistan in order to reduce the risk of  discovery,  and
    it would be persecutory to expect such  an  individual  to  modify  his
    behaviour to that end. It may well be that in some  societies  solitary
    and or private worship of another  faith  may  be  viable  because  for
    example although the background evidence reveals a general  intolerance
    in society toward that belief it does not reach  a  level  where  there
    would be a real risk of ill- treatment on discovery. This  is  not  the
    case for Afghan converts; there is no evidence that they would be  able
    to conduct themselves in this way. In reaching this conclusion we  have
    borne in mind the Tribunal's guidance in SZ and  JM  (Christians  -  FS
    Confirmed) (CG) [2008] UKAIT 00082 and  HJ  (Homosexuality:  reasonably
    tolerating living discreetly) Iran [2008] UKAIT 00044, the  latter  was
    approved by the Court of Appeal in XY (Iran) v  SSHD  [2008]  EWCA  Civ
    911.

67.   We have concluded that an Afghan national who can demonstrate  to  the
    appropriate standard that he is a genuine convert to Christianity  from
    Islam is likely to be able to demonstrate a real  risk  of  persecution
    and/or a violation of his rights under Article 3 of the ECHR on  return
    to Afghanistan.

68.   Such claims will always require careful  assessment  and  analysis  of
    the evidence that is presented on the  appellant's  behalf  as  to  the
    conversion.  Immigration Judges will need to bear in mind the  guidance
    given  by  the  Tribunal  in  previous  appeals  (see   e.g.   Dorodian
    (01/TH/1537- ) in reaching a conclusion on the evidence as  to  whether
    or not there has been a genuine conversion from Islam.

Application of these Findings to the Appellant's Case

69.   It has already been found that the appellant is a genuine  convert  to
    Christianity. In his statement he says that he has been  attending  the
    Hounslow West Evangelical Church since 2001, and every Sunday since May
    2004. He regularly attends Christian bible study meetings and  receives
    instruction in the Christian faith in Farsi. He cannot read and  relies
    on other Christians to tell him about the faith.  The  members  of  his
    church are his family and he treats the church as his home.  He  states
    that he would not be able to abandon his  faith:  he  could  not  be  a
    Muslim again because he is a Christian who loves God.  He  could  never
    pretend to be a Muslim as he would  be  lying  in  his  heart  to  God.
    He has no family in Afghanistan with whom he has any contact.  His  son
    is aware of his conversion.  Therefore if the appellant were to  return
    to his home area there  would  be  an  obvious  source  of  information
    against him i.e. his son and quite possibly the  two  Afghan  nationals
    from his home area who have now  returned.  In  that  event,  there  is
    clearly a real risk the appellant would face  the  immediate  wrath  of
    religious zealots in his home area and generally of the population.  He
    is  from  Mazar-i-Sharif,  the  town  where  there   were   large-scale
    demonstrations after the Rahman case.  The evidence  is  clear  in  our
    view that the appellant would face a real risk  of  persecution  and  a
    breach of his Article 3 rights if he had to return to his home area.

70.   We consider that a real risk remains wherever the  appellant  goes  in
    Afghanistan.  Initially the respondent would return him to  Kabul.   We
    do not accept that in a city with a population  of  approximately  five
    million, there is a real  risk  that  the  appellant  would  come  into
    contact again with the two men who threatened him in the  UK.   However
    he would need to engage in the  social  networks  that  operate  within
    Kabul in order to find employment and accommodation simply to  be  able
    to live.  This would necessitate, as the Tribunal has found  previously
    in PM, investigations into his background and we think there must be  a
    real risk that that would lead to enquiries in his  home  town  and  so
    back to his son and possibly to others who know him.  We think via that
    route  alone,  sooner  or  later,  there  is  a  real  possibility  the
    appellant's conversion would become known with the same consequent risk
    in Kabul as in his home town.

71.   However, even if we are wrong in  our  assessment  of  that  risk  the
    appellant would immediately place himself at risk if he sought to  make
    contact with other Christians in  Kabul  especially  since  he  has  no
    family for support there. Christian worship amongst groups can only  be
    undertaken underground or secretly.  We  are  unable  to  see  how  the
    appellant would be able in reality to make contact with others  of  the
    same belief without placing himself at great risk.  This would mean the
    appellant would be forced  to  worship  by  himself  and,  as  we  have
    indicated, before, to live a complete lie but with  the  constant  fear
    that he might one day be discovered and ousted. We  take  into  account
    that he is presently a member of an evangelical church  and  we  accept
    that a significant part of his faith  does  encompass  the  ability  to
    share his belief and to develop his faith with others. In  this  regard
    we take into account his personal circumstances.   We do not  think  it
    is reasonable to expect the appellant to pretend that he  is  something
    that he is not and if it were discovered  that  he  is  a  convert  the
    evidence demonstrates that his conversion will  not  be  tolerated;  he
    faces a real risk of at the very least  of  detention  because  of  his
    religion and at worst trial before a Sharia Court and harsh  punishment
    unless the appellant recanted his conversion.  The appellant could  not
    rely on any intervention by the Afghan authority in  that  process  and
    would not in any event be safe in Afghanistan even  if  the  government
    were able to intervene.

72.   In the light of the evidence of  the  appellant's  commitment  to  the
    Christian faith, in our view  he  cannot  be  expected  to  modify  his
    behaviour on return to Afghanistan and it is not reasonable  to  expect
    him to tolerate living his life in  a  manner  which  would  involve  a
    significant suppression of his religious belief.   This  would  be  the
    position wherever the appellant went in Afghanistan.

73.    We  have  concluded  therefore  that  the   appellant's   return   to
    Afghanistan would expose him to a real risk of  persecution  and  would
    subject him to a  real  risk  of  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  in
    violation of his rights under Article 3 of the ECHR.

74.   The appeal is therefore allowed on refugee and  human  rights  grounds
    but dismissed on humanitarian protection grounds.
