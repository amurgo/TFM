For the Appellant:     Mr T Hussain, of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Albania  born  28th  December  1988.  He
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge  Grimshaw)  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the   Respondent's
    decision to refuse to grant him asylum and to remove him to Albania.

 2. The main claim to asylum is based on a fear of his  father  and/or  his
    father's associates. The Appellant  comes  from  a  remote  village  in
    Northern Albania and claims to have suffered physical and mental  abuse
    at the hands of his father. He says the State can offer  no  protection
    against this and he fears that if returned to Albania his life would be
    in danger. On any return he will be targeted by his father  and/or  his
    father's associates.

 3. Added to this, he says, relocation  elsewhere  in  Albania  is  not  an
    option as there is nowhere safe from his father's reach or that of  his
    father's associates. The net is cast wide. Since arriving  in  the  UK,
    the  Appellant  has  attempted  suicide  and  is  currently   receiving
    treatment for mental health problems.

 4. The Respondent refused the claim because, she noted, it centred  around
    the actions of non-state actors. She considered that the Appellant  had
    not  established  that  there  was  a  systematic  failure   of   state
    protection. There were a number of inconsistencies in  the  Appellant's
    account.

 5. So far as internal relocation was  concerned  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered it was reasonable to expect the Appellant to live in another
    part of Albania, such as Tirana. It was further noted that his  fiancï¿½e
    and a friend were already living there. Suitable medical mental  health
    facilities also exist there.

 6. Having heard evidence  and  considered  all  the  documentary  evidence
    before her including that of an expert, the Judge made two  significant
    findings set out here:

       . She was satisfied that the Appellant had experienced the amount  of
         violence claimed, from his father.

       . She took note from the country expert  that  domestic  violence  is
         considered a private family matter which receives  little  interest
         from the authorities

 7. Permission to appeal Judge Grimshaw's decision was granted by the UT on
    14th July 2015 on a renewed application. Although four grounds were put
    forward when seeking permission, by the time of the hearing before  me,
    Mr Hussain accepted that realistically grounds 2 and  3  were  in  fact
    part and parcel of grounds 1 and 4. The relevant parts of the grant  of
    permission are reproduced here.

         "The  appellant,  a  citizen  of  Albania,  appeals   against   the
         Respondent's decision refusing his asylum, humanitarian  protection
         and  human  rights  claims.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Grimshaw
         dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

         The second ground alleges in summary that the  internal  relocation
         assessment is flawed due to the Judge completely failing to address
         whether there is equivalent risk elsewhere and  thereafter  whether
         the asylum seeker can reasonably be expected to stay there."

 8. I heard submissions from both representatives. I am satisfied  that  in
    an  otherwise carefully constructed decision, Judge Grimshaw has simply
    fallen short of deciding fully with reasons, the question of whether it
    is the reasonable or unduly harsh to expect  the Appellant to  relocate
    internally elsewhere in Albania. The Respondent has  always  maintained
    that Tirana is an option. The expert says not.

 9. The Judge made a clear finding that the Appellant  was  abused  at  the
    hands of his father - what she did not accept was that the  Appellant's
    father has social  networks  all  over  the  country.   As  Mr  Hussain
    submitted, it  is  hard  to  reconcile  that  finding  without  a  full
    rejection of the Expert's Report that internal relocation is not viable
    in this case. The Judge of course is perfectly at liberty to reject the
    Expert's evidence, but in doing so must give  clear  reasons  for  that
    rejection.

10. The Judge also, it is said, did not reconcile  her  findings  with  the
    expert's evidence concerning an almost complete lack of  mental  health
    facilities in Albania, sufficient to ensure  the  Appellant  is  not  a
    suicide risk. This discrete point also needs to be fully dealt with.

11. I find that I accept Mr Hussain's submissions. The Judge  erred  simply
    in not fully setting out her reasons for reaching the  conclusion  that
    she did on the internal relocation question. Both representatives  were
    of the view that should I find any error in the terms  submitted,  then
    the appropriate course would be to remit the matter to  Judge  Grimshaw
    to complete the task she has started. The errors   are ones  which  are
    capable of being cured by Judge Grimshaw giving full  reasons  for  her
    conclusions on internal relocation.

12.  I agree with the above course. The decision is otherwise  a  carefully
    considered one and therefore the Judge's  finding  that  the  Appellant
    suffered mental and physical abuse  at  the  hands  of  his  father  is
    preserved.  I am satisfied therefore that the Judge has  erred  on  the
    discrete point of the reasonableness of internal  relocation  and  that
    the appropriate course is to remit this matter  to  Judge  Grimshaw  to
    finalise this matter.

13. Her decision will need to take  into  account  the  Appellant's  mental
    health problems (his risk of suicide) the expert's report  and  whether
    in the light of all these circumstances internal  relocation  could  be
    said to be unduly harsh/unreasonable.

Decision

14. The FtT decision contains error. The matter is remitted to the FtT,  to
    Judge Grimshaw, in the terms outlined above.
