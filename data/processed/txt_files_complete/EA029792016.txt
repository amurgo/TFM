For the appellant:     Mr.E.Ikuazom of Ernst Law Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr.E.Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

       1. The appellant is a national of Kenya who, on 14 December 2015,
          applied for a residence card as confirmation of her right to
          reside in the United Kingdom further to European Treaty
          provisions.


       2. The application made was on the basis she was an extended family
          member of a Polish national, Mr Dominik Marceli Cyngier. In her
          application she said that they began to cohabit in 2014.

       3. It was considered under the Immigration (European Economic Area)
          Regulations 2006. The respondent was not satisfied she had
          demonstrated by supporting evidence that they were in a durable
          relationship. In order to maintain parity with domestic provisions
          evidence to show they were together for at least two years would
          be expected.

       4. Her appeal was heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer at
          Bradford on 7 July 2017. In a decision promulgated on 24 July 2017
          the judge found there was no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. This
          was on the basis of the guidance given in the Upper Tribunal
          decision of Sala (EFM's: right of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411.

       5. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been granted in
          light of the Court of Appeal decision of Khan -v- SSHD [2017] EWCA
          Civ 1755 which held that the decision in Sala was wrong.

       6. At the hearing, Mr.Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
          acknowledged that the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer
          declining jurisdiction materially erred in law as it is now
          understood. He helpfully provided me with a copy of the decision
          of SM (Algeria) -v-ECO [2018] UKSC 9 where the Supreme Court
          reaffirmed Khan -v- SSHD.

       7. Given that an error of law has been accepted the disposal of the
          appeal requires a fresh hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.
          Given the factual issues which will have to be decided a remittal
          is called for.

 Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer materially errs in law and
is set aside. There are no material facts to preserve. The matter is
remitted for de novo hearing before the First tier Tribunal.
