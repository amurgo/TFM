                      CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL PURSUANT TO
        RULE 17 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

1.    The appellant has been granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian who,
      by  a  determination  promulgated  on  3  March  2015,   allowed   the
      respondents' appeals brought before the  First-tier  Tribunal  against
      the refusal to grant them entry clearance to the United Kingdom.

2.    The Upper Tribunal has received a letter from the Secretary  of  State
      dated 23 July 2015 in which she states that she wishes to withdraw her
      case before the Upper Tribunal, on the basis that the respondents have
      now been granted entry clearance  pursuant  to  the  making  of  fresh
      applications.

3.    Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provides for a party to withdraw its case before the  Upper  Tribunal,
      with the consent of the Tribunal.


4.    The Tribunal hereby gives consent to  the  appellant  withdrawing  her
      case.

5.    The effect of the appellant's case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
      Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are  at  an
      end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal and the decision  of
      the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
