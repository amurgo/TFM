                                                                 Respondents

Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr P Duffy (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)
For the Respondent:        Ms A Patyna (counsel instructed by Indra
Sebastian Solicitors)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  appeals  of  Kritina  Shrestha
       Kayastha and her husband Subash Chandara Kayastha, itself having been
       brought against the decision of 17 December 2015 to refuse them leave
       to remain on human rights grounds.


    2. The appeals ultimately arise from the application of 11 November 2015
       for the Respondents to obtain further leave to remain  as  a  Tier  2
       migrant and dependent. They had  previously  been  granted  leave  to
       enter in the student route on 30 December  2010  until  9  May  2012,
       which had been extended until 30 August 2014.


    3. The applications were all refused because the Home Office  considered
       that information from the English language  testing  authority,  ETS,
       indicating that Ms Kayastha's test results  had  been  cancelled  for
       dishonesty, was sufficient to indicate that dishonesty had been  used
       in the course of her dealings with the Home  Office.  Furthermore  Ms
       Kayastha had relied upon a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) which was
       not genuine, which also  attracted  a  general  refusal  reason.  The
       application of their daughter Sukriti Kayastha was  refused  in  line
       with theirs.


    4. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the Secretary of  State  relied  upon
       the customary combination of evidence: an extract from the  "look-up"
       tool used to link the migrant whose English language test results had
       been cancelled to the information provided by ETS,  and  the  generic
       witness statement evidence from Peter Millington and Rebecca Collins,
       and a report by Professor French. The judge also noted she had read a
       report by Project Fa�ade in relation  to  Premier  Language  Training
       Centre, and noted that all the tests taken that day at  the  relevant
       test centre were identified as questionable or invalid.


    5. The Respondent vigorously denied involvement in any dishonesty in the
       English language testing process in her witness statement. As to  the
       CoS allegation, she Respondent freely admitted before the  First-tier
       Tribunal that  the  CoS  she  had  obtained  was  indeed  false,  but
       maintained she had been a  victim  of,  rather  than  party  to,  the
       dishonesty. She had paid �10,000 for  training  and  fees  after  two
       interviews organised by the company that had promised  to  issue  the
       CoS to her. She had complained to the police and to  the  Office  for
       the  Immigration  Services  Commissioner,   and   produced   evidence
       confirming this.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal allowed the Respondent's appeal. Its  reasons
       for sustaining the Respondent's challenge to this suitability  ground
       were essentially that she  had  scored  5.5  and  6  in  writing  and
       speaking in a subsequent test on 20 August 2014 (ie scores  exceeding
       the B1 level which a Tier 4 student must show), and also  spoke  good
       English at the hearing  before  her,  though  she  noted  that  these
       indicia of language proficiency post-dated the impugned test results.
       Additionally the Respondent had passed  a  number  of  qualifications
       with relatively  high  ratings  under  the  Regulated  Qualifications
       Framework  system,  including  Business  Management  Diplomas  and  a
       Masters Degree, taught in English.


    7. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the Respondent's evidence  regarding
       the fraud she had suffered regarding her Tier 2 CoS as  credible  and
       accordingly  found  that  the  second   refusal   reason   was   also
       unsustainable.


    8. Reviewing the appeal in  the  light  of  these  findings  as  to  the
       Respondent's suitability for the route in  question,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal decided that it was appropriate to allow the appeal, because
       it was proportionate for her to be granted limited  leave  to  remain
       sufficient to permit her to make another application to remain in the
       United Kingdom. Additionally, it was appropriate for  her  to  pursue
       her intention to help the national  authorities  to  investigate  the
       company which had defrauded her and others.


    9. Grounds of appeal from the Secretary of State argued that once it was
       accepted  that  the  initial  evidential   burden   of   establishing
       dishonesty had been traversed, the onus shifted to the Respondent  to
       offer an adequate explanation and the First-tier Tribunal had  failed
       to assess the  reasons given adequately. Furthermore, reliance on the
       Respondent's English language ability at  the  date  of  hearing  was
       contrary to the guidance in MA Nigeria.


   10. Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  for  the  First-tier
       Tribunal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal  had  relied  upon
       the Respondent's ability to speak English in determining whether  she
       had met the evidential burden; furthermore, she had not been able  to
       recall details of the test itself. This cast  doubt  on  whether  the
       assessment that she had met the burden on her to provide an  adequate
       explanation was lawful. The decision  to  refuse  further  leave  was
       proportionate absent clear reasons as to why return to Nepal would be
       disproportionate.


   11. Before me, Mr Duffy for  the  Secretary  of  State  argued  that  the
       evidential burden could not have been satisfied only by reference  to
       the factors identified  below:  post-ETS  test  evidence  of  English
       language proficiency  had  been  warned  against  in  MA  Nigeria,  a
       decision which had also warned against speculation as to the  reasons
       why a person proficient in English might have procured a  proxy  test
       result.


   12. Ms Patyna submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had been entitled to
       make the findings that she did, and that  it  had  not  impermissibly
       taken irrelevancies into account: the  factors  identified  had  been
       part of a reasoned and rational review of the evidence.


Findings and reasons


   13. I indicated that I  would  uphold  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal at the hearing, and these are my reasons.


   14. The Upper Tribunal cites  expert  evidence  deployed  by  a  litigant
       seeking to cast doubt upon the validity testing process used  by  ETS
       in Gazi (IJR) [2015] UKUT 327 (IAC):


           "Dr Harrison  also  examines,  with  accompanying  critique  and
           commentary,   the   discrete   issues   of   factors   affecting
           performance; the typical performance of human verification;  the
           definition of thresholds; the explicit acknowledgement of  human
           errors; the lack of testing of the performance of analysts;  the
           dubious touchstone of "confidence" (see Mr Millington's  witness
           statement); the dearth of information about the actual  analysis
           methodology;  the  lack  of  detail  about  the  experience  and
           knowledge of both the recruited analysts and their  supervisors;
           the indication that any training of the newly recruited analysts
           was  hurried;  the  shortcomings  in  Mr   Millington's   speech
           recognition averments; and the clear acknowledgement on the part
           of ETS that false identifications (viz false  positive  results)
           have occurred. One passage relating to  the  human  verification
           process is especially noteworthy:
                 "... although the analysts only verified matches where they
                 had no doubt about their validity  -  ie  where  they  were
                 certain about their judgments - this should not be taken as
                 a reliable indicator of the accuracy  of  those  judgments.
                 This approach does not remove the risk  of  false  positive
                 results."
           Dr Harrison also highlights that both the automatic  system  and
           the human analysts are capable of  false  positive  errors.  The
           Secretary of State's  evidence  does  not  disclose  either  the
           percentage or the volume of such errors."


   15. No findings were made on  that  evidence  in  Gazi.  However  in  the
       subsequent appeal of Qadir [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC) the UT conclude that
       the Home Office evidence had significant shortcomings, in  particular
       at [63], a lack of qualifications or expertise of the  officials  who
       visited ETS and produced witness statements based on their  visit  to
       ETS, during which  ETS  was  the  sole  arbiter  of  the  information
       disclosed and assertions made, undue Home Office  dependency  on  the
       information from ETS when ETS had put forward no  witness  or  indeed
       any other evidence whatsoever of their own, the lack  of  any  expert
       evidence backing up the opinion of the staff who visited ETS, and the
       fact that voice recording files had never been put forward pertaining
       to the appellants themselves. Accordingly the Tribunal accepted  that
       the methods used by ETS were not necessarily guaranteed to avoid  the
       occasional false positive whereby an  innocent  student  was  wrongly
       identified as having cheated in their test.


   16. However, the Upper Tribunal in Qadir accepted that the  Secretary  of
       State's generic evidence, combined with her  evidence  particular  to
       individual appellants linking them to the  allegations  made  by  ETS
       (via the "Lookup Tool" which matches the person  who  has  the  name,
       date of birth and nationality of the certificate holder  impugned  by
       ETS) sufficed to discharge the  evidential  burden  of  proving  that
       their TOEIC certificates had been procured by  dishonesty,  and  thus
       calling for a credible explanation to be put  by  the  individual  so
       accused.


   17. In MA Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal stated that


           "we acknowledge the suggestion that the Appellant had no reason
           to engage in the deception which we have found proven. However,
           this has not deflected us in any way from reaching our main
           findings and conclusions. In the abstract, of course, there is a
           range of reasons why persons proficient in English may engage in
           TOEIC fraud. These include, inexhaustively, lack of confidence,
           fear of failure, lack of time and commitment and contempt for
           the immigration system. These reasons could conceivably overlap
           in individual cases and there is scope for other explanations
           for deceitful conduct in this sphere. We are not required to
           make the further finding of why the Appellant engaged in
           deception and to this we add that this issue was not explored
           during the hearing. We resist any temptation to speculate about
           this discrete matter."


   18. In Nawaz  [2017]  UKUT  288  (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal  noted  that
       Professor French, who it acknowledged  as  an  expert  of  comparable
       quality to Dr Harrison, had  confirmed  that  technical  analysis  of
       voice comparison evidence was not an  exclusively  technical  subject
       and could  be  conducted  by  trained  non-specialists,  leading  the
       Tribunal to accept that natural ability, training, even of  a  fairly
       basic kind, and experience could all play a valuable part in the  ETS
       testing  process.  It  would  be  necessary  to  bear  in  mind   the
       difficulties  posed  by  voice  comparison  evidence  of   non-native
       speakers and the lack of any  available  records  of  contemporaneous
       notes of the testers.


   19. The President of the Upper Tribunal explained in Muhandiramge  [2015]
       UKUT 675 (IAC), that decisions in these cases involve  a  "moderately
       complex exercise" in which  "the  evidential  pendulum  swings  three
       times and in three  different  directions".  To  quote  more  of  his
       evocative words directly:


           "(a) First,  where  the  Secretary  of  State  alleges  that  an
           applicant  has  practised  dishonesty   or   deception   in   an
           application for leave to remain, there is an  evidential  burden
           on  the  Secretary  of  State.  This  requires  that  sufficient
           evidence be adduced to raise an issue as to the existence or non-
           existence of a fact in issue:  for  example,  by  producing  the
           completed application which is prima  facie  deceitful  in  some
           material fashion.
           (b) The spotlight thereby  switches  to  the  applicant.  If  he
           discharges the burden - again, an evidential one - of raising an
           innocent explanation, namely  an  account  which  satisfies  the
           minimum level of plausibility, a further transfer of the  burden
           of proof occurs.
           (c) Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests on the Secretary of
           State to establish, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  the
           Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.
           A veritable burden of proof boomerang!"


20. Applying these principles to the case in hand, I do  not  consider  that
   the findings of the First-tier Tribunal were  irrational  or  took  into
   account irrelevant considerations. The First-tier Tribunal's decision is
   generally consistent with the staged approach identified in Muhandiramge
   via which the burden shifts from one party to another: it found that the
   Secretary of State had discharged the evidential burden, having supplied
   the look-up tool and associated evidence.  It  then  assessed  the  oral
   evidence and accepted that the Respondent might well find  it  difficult
   to recall events that took place several years earlier. It took  account
   of several features of her evidence and history that  were  relevant  to
   the assessment of her English language proficiency:  the  fact  she  had
   studied to a reasonably high level in English,  and  that  her  language
   skills were attested to by her relatively fluency at the hearing, and by
   other, earlier evidence; the Tribunal was clearly alive to the fact that
   the bare  fact  of  other  English  language  qualifications  would  not
   necessarily carry the day, because of the passage of time.  It  is  also
   clear that the Tribunal was  generally  impressed  by  the  Respondent's
   character, shown by her active steps in seeking  to  participate  in  an
   investigation into the fraud she suffered when seeking a CoS to  qualify
   her for the Tier 2 Migrant route.


21. The acceptance of her evidence necessarily implies  that  it  then  fell
   upon the Secretary of State to discharge the ultimate legal burden.  The
   First-tier Tribunal was aware of the fact that not all the results  from
   the  test  centre  that  day  were  necessarily  dishonestly   obtained:
   "questionable" results are not the same as "invalid" ones, as  the  term
   is used to connote cases where ETS assesses the TOEIC score as  doubtful
   because of the broader context of the case rather than  treating  it  as
   definitively dishonest. Whilst it may be  thought  that  the  Tribunal's
   conclusion was a generous one,  I  do  not  consider  that  overall  its
   conclusion was outside the range of reasonable responses to the material
   before it.


22. I accordingly find that the Secretary of State's grounds of  appeal  are
   not made out on the English language issue. The reasoning of the  First-
   tier Tribunal on the other issue of suitability was not disputed.


23. Mr Duffy realistically conceded that, if the Upper Tribunal  upheld  the
   approach of the First-tier Tribunal on suitability, then it should  make
   a decision that recognised that the matter was  effectively  outstanding
   before the Secretary of State, as the only material refusal reasons  had
   been overturned. Of course the jurisdiction of the Tribunal  is  limited
   to the statutory grounds of  appeal,  brought  under  the  Human  Rights
   Convention alone; it cannot allow an appeal simply because a decision is
   "not in accordance with the law".


24. I accept that the Respondents had inevitably  established  a  degree  of
   private life in the United Kingdom during their  significant  period  of
   lawful residence in  this  country  studying  and  working.  Given  that
   neither of the suitability issues have been sustained,  the  Respondents
   are potential candidates for the grant of leave to remain.  Given  their
   English  language  proficiency  and   independent   means   (necessarily
   established by having fulfilled the requirements of  the  student  route
   for a significant period) and the consideration that their residence has
   been consistently lawful, the section 117B factors are either neutral or
   point in their favour.


25. As Mr Duffy reminded me, the Home Office has policies to ensure  that  a
   person who loses the benefit of a CoS for reasons beyond  their  control
   should not  be  prejudiced.  The  existence  of  such  dispensations  is
   relevant to the assessment  of  proportionality.  So,  filling  out  the
   reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal somewhat, I accept that the refusal
   of the applications for leave to  remain  was  disproportionate  to  the
   private life of  the  Respondents,  bearing  in  mind  that  the  public
   interest would be well-served by their availability in providing further
   evidence to permit an investigation into the activities of  the  company
   that defrauded them and others and thus tended to undermine  immigration
   control.


          Decision:

    The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed. The appeals  against
    the  original  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State  refusing   the
    applications for leave to remain are allowed on human  rights  grounds.
    The original applications are accordingly outstanding before  the  Home
    Office for lawful decision.


 Signed:                                           Date: 22 December 2017
