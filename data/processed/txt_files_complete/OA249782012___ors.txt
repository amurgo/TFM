Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Rahman, Legal Representative of AR Immigration
Service
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Appellants who are  sisters  and  citizens  of
    Bangladesh whose respective dates  of  birth  are  3  August  1997,  11
    December 1994 and 15 August 2001.

2.   The Appellants applied for an entry clearance to join their parents  in
    the United Kingdom with a view to settlement under paragraph 281 of the
    Immigration Rules and their application was  assessed  under  paragraph
    301 of the Rules.

3.   The decisions in relation  to  each  of  them  were  identical  and  in
    summary the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) was not satisfied  that  they
    were related as claimed  to  their  Sponsor  or  that  there  would  be
    adequate accommodation (matters  that  were  since  resolved  in  their
    favour before the First-tier Tribunal).

4.   The ECO was further not satisfied that the parties  would  be  able  to
    maintain themselves and any dependants adequately without  recourse  to
    public funds as required under paragraphs 281(v) and  301(iva)  of  the
    Rules.

5.   In that latter regard and in refusing entry clearance,  the  ECO  noted
    that the Appellants' sister in the UK, whom  I  shall  simply  call  TB
    received �639.04 per month or �147.47 per week.  TB's  bank  statements
    showed that she spent (as the ECO  put  it)  "her  entire  income  each
    month".  The ECO was therefore not satisfied that "her offer of support
    [was] realistic".

6.   The Appellants' appeal against that decision was dismissed  before  the
    First-tier Judge in a determination promulgated on 11 December 2013 but
    they successfully obtained permission  to  appeal  that  decision,  not
    least because it was considered  arguable  that  the  First-tier  Judge
    misdirected herself in calculating the first Sponsor's income.

7.   Thus the appeal came before me on 12 March 2014 when  (as  recorded  in
    my decision promulgated shortly thereafter) Mr Melvin who appeared  for
    the Respondent informed me that whilst he accepted that the  First-tier
    Judge had erred in the calculation of not least the Sponsor's  father's
    income such  as  had  led  her  into  error,  there  remained  a  clear
    difference between the parties as to  the  materiality  of  this  error
    given the ECO's discard of the United  Kingdom  sibling's  (TB)  income
    into his calculations that led him  to  conclude  that  the  Appellants
    failed to meet the maintenance requirements of the rules.

8.   At paragraph 29 of my decision, I had this to say:

         "29. It is apparent to me, and I so find, that upon  a  reading  of
             the determination, once the First-tier  Judge  had,  upon  her
             mistaken  calculations,  concluded   that   it   rendered   it
             impossible for the Appellants to meet the requirements of  the
             maintenance Rules, and that her finding was  thus  dispositive
             of the immigration  appeal,  she  must  have  in  consequence,
             considered it unnecessary to investigate any other aspects  of
             the ECO's refusal as in the light of  her  finding,  it  would
             have made no difference to her decision that the appeal should
             be dismissed.


         30.  It follows that, as I informed the  parties',  the  First-tier
             Judge compounded one error of law with another, the effect  of
             which was material to the outcome of the appeal, such that the
             determination of the First-tier Judge should be set aside."

9.   I recorded that with the agreement of the parties, the  fresh  decision
    to be made would be upon the sole issue of whether and to what  extent,
    the income of the Sponsor's daughter, TB, could be taken  into  account
    in order to show that the Appellants had established that they would be
    maintained adequately without recourse to public  funds  in  accordance
    with the Rules.

10.  In that regard, I was informed by Mr Rahman for  the  Appellants,  that
    TB would give oral evidence for which purpose  she  would  require  the
    services of a Bengali/Syhleti  interpreter.  I  also  made  appropriate
    directions for the purposes of the hearing that was resumed  before  me
    on 25 April 2014.

11.  Prior to the resumed hearing and in accordance with  those  directions,
    the Tribunal received from  the  Appellants'  representatives  together
    with a covering letter dated 22 April 2014, their bundle  of  documents
    together with a skeleton argument.   Regrettably,  despite  my  earlier
    directions, the  Respondent  failed  to  do  likewise.   However,  that
    problem was mitigated by the fact that the Tribunal had the benefit  of
    an experienced  Presenting  Officer  in  Mr  Saunders  to  present  the
    Respondent's case before me at the resumed hearing.

12.  In that latter regard and in reliance  on  the  provisions  of  Section
    84(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and upon  the
    guidance of the starred Tribunal decision in DR* (Morocco) (ECO - post-
    decision evidence) [2005] UKIAT 00038, I  was  reminded  by  Mr  Rahman
    within the skeleton argument that he authored, that I was not  confined
    to a consideration of the evidence that was before the ECO.   Indeed  I
    have noted that in DR it was held inter alia that there was a  contrast
    between "circumstances appertaining" at the  date  of  decision  and  a
    matter "arising" after that, in entry clearance cases.  Thus  I  agreed
    with Mr Rahman that I was entitled to consider post-decision facts that
    were material insofar as they shed light on facts in existence  at  the
    time of the ECO's decision.

13.  At paragraph 9 of his skeleton argument and for the assistance  of  the
    Tribunal  Mr  Rahman  reiterated  those  aspects  of  the   Appellants'
    applications that were not in dispute that he  accurately  set  out  as
    follows:

         ".   The Appellants are related to the  Sponsors  (parents  and  UK
             siblings) as claimed


         .    The Appellants' father is employed as a chef at Malikas Indian
             Restaurant Oxford since February 2012 and gets �280 per week.


         .    The Appellants'  mother  is  employed  as  kitchen  porter  at
             Peppers Burger, Oxford since January 2012 and  gets  �150  per
             week.


         .    The Appellants' parents' incomes on their own are insufficient
             to meet the family's maintenance costs.


         .    The  Appellants'  eldest  sister  is  employed  as  a  general
             assistance at Ahmed Tandoori  Indian  Takeaway,  Witney  since
             February 2012 and  gets  approximately  �648  paid  in  weekly
             instalments of �150.


         .    If the Appellants' sister's  income  is  included,  there  are
             sufficient maintenance costs for the family.


         .    There is adequate accommodation for the  Appellants  and  they
             will be living with their parents and two female siblings."


14.  The Appellants' bundle of documents  (quite  apart  from  referring  to
    relevant case law  to which I had referred in detail in my  promulgated
    error of law decision - attached) also included reference to Abubakar v
    ECO [2012] EWCA Civ 377 that held that one had to assess maintenance in
    the round.  That case related to the  practical  reality  in  Rule  317
    cases and to third party to support that would be routed or accrued  if
    not directly then indirectly to the Sponsor; the  reality  being  there
    was one family unit and one family financial pot - there was no rule of
    "disaggregation" regarding such third party support.

15.  I pause there because, in the course of the  resumed hearing before  me
    and having  heard the parties' representatives closing  submissions,  I
    pointed out and indeed formed the view (to the extent if  any  that  is
    relevant to the outcome of this appeal) that strictly speaking  and  on
    the evidence that I had both heard orally from Miss  TB  and  from  her
    written statement, it was apparent to me that  the  contribution  which
    she claimed to make to the family  income  could  not  be  regarded  as
    "third party" support because she was  in  fact  on  her  evidence,  an
    integrated member of the family unit who lived  with  her  parents  and
    therefore contributed from her income to the family income pot.

16.  As I say, the bundle of documents indeed  included  Miss  TB's  witness
    statement in which she maintained that she was a solvent individual who
    did not spend her entire income on her own personal use  as  originally
    envisaged by the ECO.  She was single and continued to  live  with  her
    parents in the family  home,  in  relation  to  which  her  living  and
    accommodation costs were jointly  shared  with  the  family.   Miss  TB
    maintained that she received her income in cash having initially used a
    bank to deposit some of her income and that  she  subsequently  stopped
    using the bank due to a lack of habit. She kept  some  monies  for  her
    personal use but insisted she gave the rest  to  her  parents  for  use
    towards the family and to cover all related costs.

17.  At the outset of the  resumed  hearing  before  me,  Mr  Saunders  most
    helpfully informed me, and I would agree accurately so, that really the
    purpose of this resumed hearing did  not  strictly  speaking  raise  an
    issue of law.  The fact was that the ECO had  decided  that  Miss  TB's
    earnings "were not up to scratch".  Mr  Saunders  accepted  that  those
    earnings were potentially in play and the question was whether, on  the
    evidence, the requirements of  the  maintenance  Rules  were  met.   Mr
    Saunders also happened to mention that had he been in a position to  do
    a skeleton argument that would have been exactly  what  he  would  have
    said.  Mr Rahman most realistically accepted that analysis.

18.  Through the services of an interpreter with whom Miss TB expressed  her
    satisfaction, she gave her oral evidence.  Miss TB was asked  what  she
    did with her wages and she told me that out of her salary she kept back
    an average of �30 to �40 per week for her  personal  expenses  but  the
    rest of it went on a weekly basis to her parents, "according  to  their
    needs".

19.  Miss TB clarified that this in fact meant that she gave her parents  on
    average �110 per week and when asked  how  long  this  arrangement  was
    likely to continue, she notably answered: "As long as I am working  and
    as long as I am capable of doing it for my family I wiill  continue  to
    do that for them".

20.  When cross-examined, Mr Saunders explained to Miss TB that one  had  to
    look at the situation  as  it  stood  in  October  2012,  the  date  of
    decision, and as to the arrangements at that time.    Miss  TB  swiftly
    replied that the situation as it stood today was the  same  in  October
    2012.

21.  There was no re-examination.

  22.    Mr Saunders in his brief and typically succinct  submission  to  me
      said  that  he  had  looked  at  Mr  Rahman's  skeleton  argument,  in
      particular at paragraphs 16 and 17, and I feel  it  prudent  in  those
      circumstances to set  below  what  Mr  Rahman  had  to  say  in  those
      paragraphs:


         "16.   The  benefits  guidance  of  2012/2013   states   that   the
             Appellants, their parents and UK based  siblings  require  the
             following minimum weekly funds after  deducting  accommodation
             costs:
|.  Parents                   |�111.45 (couple = �111.45)    |
|.  Applicants and minor      |�259.96 (child = �64.99)      |
|sibling                      |                              |
|.  Eldest sibling [that is   |�53.45 (single adult 18-25 =  |
|Miss TB]                     |�53.45)                       |
|                             |                              |
|.  Family premium �17.40     |�17.40                        |
|                             |                              |
|Total                        |�442.26                       |

         17.  The total  income  available  to  the  Appellants  from  their
             parents' and sisters' earnings is  approximately  �579.56  per
             week. After accommodation costs of  �128.96  per  week  (rent:
             �103.85; council tax: �25.11 per week) this leaves the  family
             with approximately �450.60  per  week.   There  are  therefore
             sufficient funds for the Appellants, parents and  siblings  to
             maintain themselves."

23.  Mr Saunders point was this; that he took no issue with  the  arithmetic
    in that when  one  looked  at  it,  it  appeared  that  the  Appellants
    "squeaked in by �8.34".   However, Mr Saunders continued, if  one  took
    account of what Miss TB  took for  herself,  albeit  a  modest  amount,
    "they don't get home".

24.  Mr Saunders concluded that Miss TB's evidence was  "entirely  credible"
    but that on her evidence he repeated the family fell short.

25.  Mr Rahman in response referred to the breakdown of the figures that  he
    had set out at paragraphs 16 and  17  of  his  skeleton  argument.   He
    pointed out that of course the  figures  shown  at  paragraph  16  were
    designed to demonstrate what the benefits guidance was for  the  period
    relevant to this decision 2012-2013 and he continued as follows:

         "The eldest sibling's requirement is �53.45 - the �442.26  referred
         to quite properly by Mr Saunders as the "target figure" is made  up
         of living costs for the eldest sibling, Miss TB.


         The �30 - �40 per week that she kept for  herself  was  essentially
         representative of that component i.e. the �53.45.


         Those are living costs.  The �442.26 target  is  the  target  after
         accommodation costs, namely rent and council tax.


         The State has then determined that a single adult aged between 18 -
         25 requires �53.45 per week for living costs.  In that regard  Miss
         TB has clearly shown that she takes �30 - �40 per week and actually
         then leaves the rest for her family."

26.  Mr Rahman continued that therefore the situation  was  academic.    The
    fact that Miss TB was living with her parents meant that there  was  no
    rent, no bills, no food expenses, indeed expenditure that Miss  TB  had
    set out within her written statement.  Mr Rahman concluded that if that
    money was then taken away then the �53.45 would have to be taken out of
    the equation, that in effect, would simply not make sense.

Assessment

27.  I begin by stating that I  found,  in  common  with  Mr  Saunders,  the
    evidence of Miss TB both in terms of her  written  statement  and  oral
    evidence before me, to be wholly credible.  I saw no  reason  to  doubt
    anything that she had to say in evidence. I have reminded  myself  that
    in my error of law decision I had at  paragraph  23  referred  to  what
    their Lordships had to say at paragraph 19 of Mahad (Ethiopia) v  Entry
    Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16, that one should not lose sight of the
    fact that it was always for the applicant to satisfy the ECO  that  the
    third party support relied upon was indeed "assured".

28.  Whilst I do not  necessarily  regard  Miss  TB's  contribution  to  the
    family income to represent that of third party support for the  reasons
    I have given above, I am satisfied that her contribution to the  family
    pot from her income was indeed "assured".

29.  I agree  with  the  reasons  given  by  Mr  Rahman  for  rebutting  the
    contention raised by Mr Saunders in his closing submission.

30.  Upon my consideration of the Rules and the relevant case  law  guidance
    to which I have earlier referred and applied against the backdrop of my
    findings, it is apparent that the Rules require evidence of  an  income
    at a given level from the number of people  involved  to  establish  an
    adequacy of maintenance without  recourse  to  public  funds.  How  the
    family spend that income is a matter for  them.   In  particular  since
    most people spend their money without significant  weekly  savings,  if
    the Respondent's contention was correct, then the fact that the  family
    lived up to its  income  would  invariably  render  it  impossible  for
    another person to join a family unit however large the family income.

31.  As it is, and on the basis of my findings in the present  case,  it  is
    apparent to me not least to the requisite  standard  of  proof,  namely
    that of a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants have discharged
    the burden upon them to demonstrate that their  UK  siblings'  sister's
    income can be brought into account  to  show  that  there  is  adequate
    maintenance available to them in accordance with the Immigration Rules.



Decision

32.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that their  decision  in  the
    present appeal should be set aside.

33.  I remake the decision on the appeal by allowing it.
