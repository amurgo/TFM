For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Ms Martin


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  in  1982.   He  appealed
    against a decision of the Respondent on 15 February 2013 to  refuse  to
    vary the Appellant's leave to remain made on 23 November 2012.

 2. The Respondent  considered  the  application,  which  was  made  on  23
    November 2012, under paragraph 245ZX and Appendices  A  and  C  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Although satisfied on Appendix A the Respondent was
    not satisfied that the Appellant had the requisite  evidence  of  funds
    for maintenance (Appendix C).

 3. As a person studying in inner London it was stated that  the  Appellant
    needed to show that he had the required funds to cover the fees for the
    first academic year and �1,000  per  month  for  two  months.   It  was
    accepted that his fees for the first year had been paid.

 4. As for the �2,000 maintenance he had to show that he was in  possession
    of that amount for a consecutive 28 day period as required by paragraph
    1A of Appendix C.

 5. As the closing date of the bank statements submitted in support of  the
    application was dated 12 November 2012 he needed to  show  evidence  of
    �2,000 maintenance for 28 days from 16  October  2012  to  12  November
    2012.

 6. However,  between  12  October  2012  and  25  October  2012  his  bank
    statements indicated that he was in possession of no more than �941.06.
     Although the necessary funds were in place between 25 October 2012 and
    12 November 2012, such was less than 28 days.

 7. The Appellant appealed.   In  his  grounds  he  stated  that  with  his
    application he had submitted a bank statement for the period 12 October
    2012 to 12 November 2012.  Also, further documentation  from  the  bank
    covering the period 12 November 2012 to 22 November  2012.   Looked  at
    together these documents showed evidence of funds of  at  least  �3,429
    for 28 days, i.e. from 25 October 2012 to 22 November 2012.

 8. The appeal was heard before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Howard  at
    Hatton Cross on 14 June 2013.  In his  brief  findings  the  judge  (at
    [13]) stated "on the 23 November 2012 the Appellant  had  �2,029.64  in
    his bank and the bank statement submitted with  his  Notice  of  Appeal
    covering the period 25 October 2012 to the 23 November 2012 shows  that
    during this period his account held more than �2,000."

 9. He went on, however, to state that as under s85A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  he  was  only  permitted  to  consider
    evidence which "was submitted in support of, and at the time of making,
    the application to which the immigration decision related" and  as  the
    "bank statement which shows the correct funds for  the  correct  period
    was not submitted with the application", the appeal had to be dismissed
    under the Rules.

10. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by a  judge
    on 15 July 2013 who stated:

         "...

         2.    The  Judge  was  not  satisfied  that   the   Appellant   had
             demonstrated the required funds  for  the  continuous  28  day
             period.  The Appellant submits that  the  Judge  misunderstood
             the evidence presented with respect to available funds.  It is
             submitted that in the  absence  of  further  transactions  the
             Judge  should  have  understood  that  the  balance   remained
             constant after the last transaction shown.   It  is  submitted
             that had the Judge looked at the date on the  statement  taken
             together with the date of the last translation he  would  have
             found that the Appellant demonstrated that  he  did  have  the
             requested funds.

         3.   The grounds are arguable."

11. At the error of law hearing before me Mr Muhammad  essentially  adopted
    his grounds.  For the Respondent Ms Martin accepted that the judge  had
    erred in failing to note that bank documents had been provided with the
    application which indicated that the Appellant had the necessary  funds
    from 12 November 2012 to 22 November 2012 and that when looked at  with
    the evidence of adequate funds in the period  25  October  2012  to  12
    November 2012 such showed that as a matter of fact he held the required
    funds for the required 28 days.  The problem was that the bank document
    for the later period (12 November to 22 November) was not in  the  form
    required by the Rules.  Thus as a matter of law he  did  not  have  the
    funds.

12. I reserved my decision.

13. In considering this matter the sole issue  is  maintenance.   Paragraph
    245ZX(d) requires that an Appellant must have a minimum  of  10  points
    under paragraph 10 to 14 of Appendix C.  Paragraph  11  of  Appendix  C
    requires an applicant studying in inner London to show  funds  for  the
    first academic year plus �1,000 for the first two months.

14. Paragraph 1A(a) requires the Appellant to have had the funds  specified
    at the date of application.  Also, "(c) if the Appellant is applying as
    a Tier 4 Migrant the applicant must have had the funds referred to  ...
    for a consecutive 28 day period of time."

15. In this case it is not disputed that  the  Appellant  lodged  with  the
    application a copy of a NatWest bank statement covering the period from
    12 October 2012 until 12 November 2012.  The statement shows a  maximum
    balance of �941 from 12 October 2012 until 25 October 2012.  From  that
    date until 7 November 2012 it shows a balance above �2,000.  While  the
    judge noted that bank statement he apparently failed  to  note  another
    NatWest document (C4) dated 22 November 2012 which was lodged with  the
    application.  It shows a balance of more than �2,000 in the  period  25
    October  2012  to  7  November  2012  (in  confirmation  of  the   bank
    statement).  In addition, it shows no transactions between the date the
    statement was produced (12 November 2012) and  the  date  of  the  bank
    document i.e. 22 November 2012.

16. The clear indication, as Ms Martin  accepted,  was  that  in  the  bank
    information  provided  with  the  application  the  Appellant  had  the
    required �2,000 in his account in the period  25  October  2012  to  22
    November 2012 not just 25 October to 12 November, thus a period  of  28
    days.

17. Ms Martin's point was that while the judge may have erred in not taking
    account of bank evidence that was lodged with the application  and  was
    before him it  was  not  material  as  the  evidence  was  not  in  the
    prescribed form.  She referred me to paragraph 1B  of  Appendix  C  and
    suggested that under 1B(c)  the document (C4) was a  supporting  letter
    from the bank and that it did not satisfy  the  Rules  as  it  was  not
    stamped or certified.

18. It seems to me that the document at C4 is clearly not  a  bank  letter.
    Nor is it strictly a statement.   It  is  headed  "Account  Transaction
    Details" and is a summary of transactions from 25  October  2012  until
    the details were sought on 22 November 2012.

19. The difficulty in my judgment with Judge Howard's determination is that
    he failed to pay heed to the Appellant's Grounds  of  Appeal  where  he
    stated that the Respondent "was obliged to ask for further evidence  if
    was considered that some document is missing from the application."

20. Paragraph 245AA of the Rules states that

         "(a)     where Part 6A or any appendices  referred  to  a  Part  6A
             state that specified documents must be provided, the UK Border
             Agency  will  only  consider  documents  submitted  with   the
             application, and will only consider documents submitted  after
             the application where sub-paragraph (b) applies.

         (b)  the sub-paragraph applies if the applicant has submitted ...

             (ii) a document in the wrong format; or

             (iii)    a document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                  document, the UK Border Agency will contact the  applicant
                  or his representative in writing, and request the  correct
                  documents ...."

21. The evidence in this case, as accepted  by  Ms  Martin,  was  that  the
    Appellant provided adequate evidence that he had the required funds for
    28 days prior to the application.  However, the evidence in that regard
    covering the period 25 October 2012 to 22 November  2012,  an  "Account
    Transaction Details" from NatWest was not in  the  proper  format  and,
    indeed, was a photocopy.

22. It is clear that the  Respondent  did  not  contact  the  Appellant  as
    required by paragraph 245AA. Further, it is clear that paragraph 245 AA
    (c) does not apply. Had the error referred to  in  (b)  been  addressed
    such would have led to a grant there being no other basis for it to  be
    refused. The Respondent's decision was, accordingly, not in  accordance
    with the law.  Judge Howard materially erred  in  failing  to  consider
    paragraph 245AA despite the issue having been raised in his grounds  by
    the Appellant.  The determination is set aside.





Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law.  It is set aside and remade as follows:

The appeal is allowed to the extent that the decision of the  Respondent  is
not in accordance with the law.
