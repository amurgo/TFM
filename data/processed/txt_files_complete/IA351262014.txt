For the claimant: Mr I Hussain, instructed by Syeds Solicitors
For the appellant:     Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge McAteer promulgated 2.1.15, allowing the claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State,  dated  27.3.14,
    to refuse his application made on  19.11.13  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK, and to remove him from the United Kingdom pursuant to
    section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 15.12.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.2.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Coker granted permission  to  appeal  on
    26.5.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 6.4.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I found such error of law in the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge McAteer to be set aside and remade in the First-tier Tribunal,
    in accordance with the attached directions.

 5. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. The claimant came to the UK as a student in 2009,  with  leave
    until 30.4.13. Within extant leave he  applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain, but on 20.10.13 he was informed that  as  the  licence  of  his
    college had been suspended, he had 60 days to leave the UK or submit  a
    new application. He did not make a new student application but  instead
    on 19.11.13 applied on form SET(F)  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain,
    apparently based on human rights.

 6. His case was that his circumstances have changed since he first came to
    the UK. His mother and 6 siblings had all relocated to the UK  to  join
    his father, and all have been given leave to  remain  and  that  all  9
    members of the  family  including  the  claimant  reside  at  the  same
    address. He claimed he had no remaining  immediate  family  members  in
    Pakistan, other than his grandmother, cared for by his uncle.  He  also
    claimed to be the carer for his mother, who has had heart surgery.

 7. The application was refused under paragraph 322(1) as  his  application
    was made for a purpose not covered by the Rules. The Secretary of State
    went on to consider his private life claim under paragraph 276ADE,  but
    did not accept he had severed all ties including social,  cultural  and
    family  with  Pakistan,  the  then  test  under  paragraph  276ADE.  No
    exceptional  circumstances  were  found   to   justify   allowing   his
    application  outside  the  Rules  on  article  8  ECHR   grounds.   The
    application was thus refused on 27.3.14.

 8. At �13 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal the judge  considered
    Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60  (IAC)  and  in
    particular that part relating to paragraph 276ADE and  the  meaning  of
    'no ties,' as requiring a  "rounded  assessment  of  all  the  relevant
    circumstances and is not to be limited to 'social, cultural and family'
    circumstances," and the relevant  factors  set  out  in  �125  of  that
    decision, including the length of time in the UK, the  age  the  person
    left that country, language, the exposure to the cultural norms of  the
    country and the extent of family and friends in the country to which he
    will be removed and the quality of those relationships.

 9. At �92 the judge found that the claimant had lived in Pakistan until he
    was 21 years of age and is able to speak the language of  his  country.
    "His time there would, I have found, exposed him to the cultural  norms
    of that country, albeit at a younger age than he is now  given  he  has
    spent the last 5 years in the UK. That  upon  the  face  of  it,  would
    provide him with a cultural connection to Pakistan."

10. At �97 the judge found that  "viewing  the  appellant's  situation  and
    circumstances as a whole, that he can now be said  to  have  no  family
    ties in Pakistan." The judge found no evidence of any  social  ties  to
    Pakistan and accepted at �99 that he had established a private life  in
    the UK through his studies and his family. At �100  the  judge  stated,
    "Balancing all of the circumstances of the  appellant's  case,  I  find
    that, on the balance of probabilities, the appellant can now be said to
    have no ties to Pakistan. Such cultural ties as he has to  the  country
    are outweighed in the circumstances of this case, I find, by  the  lack
    of any effective family, social or other ties to Pakistan."

11. As the grounds explain in some detail, the approach to  the  'no  ties'
    assessment was flawed. Ogundimu was  quoted  extensively  by  the  high
    court in Bailey [2014] EWCH 1078 (Admin), where it was pointed out that
    Ogundimu related to a person who had come to the UK  as  a  very  young
    child, aged only 6 and was then 22,  and  was  effectively  a  complete
    stranger to the home country. The claimant cannot be described in  such
    a way, or as a complete stranger to Pakistan. He has not  severed  ties
    with Pakistan, having left there as an adult in 2009 with the intention
    to  return  on  completion  of  his  studies.  Further,  he  will  have
    maintained cultural ties by his residence with his extended family  now
    in the UK. There is no reason why he would have any special  difficulty
    in reintegrating into Pakistan.

12. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Coker  considered  it  arguable
    that the judge erred in law at �100 by  concluding  that,  "whilst  the
    (claimant) did have  (cultural)  ties  to  Pakistan,  those  ties  were
    negated  by  his  lack  of  other  (family  and  social)  ties.  It  is
    appropriate for the Upper Tribunal to consider  this  approach  to  the
    application of paragraph 276ADE."

13. I find that the judge was in error to suggest that  the  cultural  ties
    found as a fact by the judge, could be outweighed by a lack  of  family
    or social ties. Whilst a rounded assessment is appropriate, it is not a
    balancing exercise or computation between competing ties. On  the  then
    wording of paragraph 276ADE, if  the  claimant  has  cultural  ties  to
    Pakistan he cannot be said to have demonstrated to have no ties.

14. There are other errors in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The
    judge was in error to conclude that the  claimant's  private  life  was
    developed in the UK at a time  when  his  leave  was  limited  but  not
    precarious. Clearly, his continued lawful presence in the  UK  depended
    on being granted further leave to remain, and such, as  confirmed  more
    recently in  AM  (Malawi)  [2015]  UKUT  0260  (IAC),  his  status  was
    precarious such that little weight should  be  given  to  such  private
    life.

15. Further, the appellant's lawful status in the UK was  only  ever  as  a
    student. Whilst each case must be considered on its own facts, the sort
    of private life a student develops is  not  within  the  protection  of
    moral and physical integrity envisioned by article 8 ECHR. In Nasim and
    others  (article  8)  [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal
    considered whether the hypothetical removal of the  22  PBS  claimants,
    pursuant to the decision to refuse to vary  leave,  would  violate  the
    UK's obligations under article 8 ECHR.  The  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity."

16. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

17. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:

         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

18. The panel pointed out  that  at  this  point  on  the  continuum,  "the
    essential elements of the private  life  relied  on  will  normally  be
    transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in  their
    essential respects, following a person's return to their home  country,
    (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its limited utility to an individual where
    one has moved along the continuum, from that  Article's  core  area  of
    operation towards what might be described as its  fuzzy  penumbra.  The
    limitation arises, both from what will at that point  normally  be  the
    tangential effect on the individual of the  proposed  interference  and
    from the fact that, unless there are particular reasons to  reduce  the
    public interest of enforcing immigration controls, that  interest  will
    consequently prevail in  striking  the  proportionality  balance  (even
    assuming that stage is reached)."

19. It follows that any private life the claimant may have developed in the
    UK is unlikely to engage article  8  ECHR,  but  can  be  developed  in
    Pakistan. He can continue contact with his family now in the UK through
    modern means of communication and  through  occasional  visits.  As  an
    adult he can be expected to make his own way in the  world  independent
    of his family members. It follows that the finding  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the decision of the Secretary  of  State  is  flawed  and
    cannot stand.

20. In the circumstances, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  must  be
    set aside for error of law to be remade. I acceded to  the  submissions
    of the parties that the remaking of the decision in the  appeal  should
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

21. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the findings are flawed on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

22. In all the circumstances, I relist this case to be remade in the first-
    tier tribunal, on the basis that this is a case  which  falls  squarely
    within the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2.  The
    effect of the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing
    and that the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

23. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal  in  accordance  with  the  attached
                    directions.

Consequential Directions

24. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Birmingham  to  be
    made de novo, with no findings preserved;

25. There will be two witnesses and the estimated length of hearing is  1.5
    hours;

26. The claimant's representative confirmed that  no  interpreter  will  be
    required;

27. The appeal may be heard by any First-tier Tribunal Judge  except  Judge
    McAteer and Judge Macdonald;

28. Not later  than  10  working  days  before  the  relisted  hearing  the
    claimant's representatives must serve a single,  revised,  consolidated
    paginated and indexed bundle comprising all  subjective  and  objective
    evidence relied on by the claimant, together with any skeleton argument
    to be relied on, and copies of any relevant case law. The Tribunal will
    not accept material submitted on the day of the hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
