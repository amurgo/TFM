                            (NO ANONYMITY ORDER)
                                                                  Respondent


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1. The First-tier Tribunal determination in this appeal was set aside  by  a
   decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington,  on  the  respondent's
   application, on 4 August 2014 and the determination is to  be  remade  in
   the Upper Tribunal.   I will refer to the parties as the claimant and the
   Secretary of State for clarity.

2. By a letter dated 27 August 2014, the  claimant's  solicitors,  Maalik  &
   Co, stated that they were instructed to withdraw  the  claimant's  appeal
   against the respondent's decision to refuse her further leave  to  remain
   as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant, because the  claimant  had  decided  on  a
   voluntary return to India.  The  solicitors  had  submitted  a  voluntary
   departure request and the claimant will be returning to India as soon  as
   that request was processed.

3. Pursuant to paragraph 17  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
   Rules 2008 (as amended), the permission of the Upper Tribunal is required
   for such withdrawal.

4. On behalf of the Upper Tribunal I consent to that withdrawal.
