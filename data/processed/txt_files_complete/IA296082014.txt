                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Herbert OBE, promulgated  on  23rd  December  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Hendon Magistrates' Court on 10th  December  2014.   In  the
    determination, the judge allowed the  appeal  of  Miss  Mei  Zou.   The
    Respondent Secretary  of  State,  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female  citizen  of  China  who  was  born  on  22nd
    February 1987.  She appeals against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 11th July 2014 to refuse  her  application  to
    vary leave to remain in the UK  under  the  points-based  system.   The
    applicable Rules are paragraph 41-SD(e)(v) of Appendix A.

 3. The basis of the Respondent's rejection under the  points-based  system
    was that the Appellant could not be awarded 25 points because she could
    not provide satisfactory evidence to demonstrate that she had access to
    at least �50,000.  She had not submitted  at  Companies  House  Current
    Appointment Report which showed the date she registered as  a  director
    of a new or existing  company.   Moreover,  the  stated  job  title  of
    careers' advisors did not affect the services  that  the  business  was
    offering because the evidence supplied suggests that she was working as
    a travel agent which is a job role below NQF level 4.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that the  Respondent  had  incorrectly  taken  only  one
    aspect of the Appellant's self-employed function into account,  namely,
    that she worked in a travel agency.  The Appellant ought to  have  been
    awarded 25 points on the basis that she did have  funds  available  and
    was skilled to the NQF level 4 or above.

 5. The Appellant was registered  as  a  new  business  in  which  she  was
    director and the evidence enclosed from Companies House did  include  a
    printout of form IN01 which "clearly listed the  Appellant  as  a  sole
    director of a company with the document itself confirming authorisation
    as well as authenticity  which  the  Respondent  failed  to  take  into
    account" (paragraph 23).

 6. The judge allowed the appeal on the basis that he was satisfied on  the
    evidence that the Appellant complied with the  Immigration  Rules  (see
    paragraph 24).  Thereafter, the judge also gave  consideration  to  the
    case of Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 and  suggested
    that had the Respondent  been  of  the  view  that  the  IN01  document
    submitted was not satisfactory then, "the Respondents could and  should
    have used the evidential flexibility  policy  and  requested  that  the
    Directive should be shown under an  alternative  format..."  (paragraph
    26).

 7. Consideration was given to Article 8 and the application of the "Razgar
    principles", but the appeal was dismissed on this basis (see paragraphs
    30 to 34).

 8. The judge concluded by stating that the Appellant did  have  access  to
    funds of �50,000 in circumstances that does comply with the information
    before the judge and the decision to refuse was not in accordance  with
    the law (see paragraphs 36 to 37).

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  law  because
    paragraphs 41-SD of Appendix A makes it quite clear that,

         "If claiming points for being a director of a  UK  company  at  the
         time of his application, a printout of a Current Appointment Report
         from Companies House, dated no earlier than three months before the
         date of the application, listing the applicant as a director  of  a
         company that is actively trading and not dormant, or struck off, or
         dissolved  or  in  liquidation,  and  showing  the  date   of   his
         appointment as a director of that company..."

    is essential.  Moreover, the Rules make it clear that,

         "If claiming points for being a director of a UK company other than
         the company referred to above, at any time before the date  of  his
         application, a printout from Companies  House  of  the  applicant's
         appointment  history,  showing  that   the   applicant   has   held
         directorships continuously during the period in which he claims  to
         have been a director"

    should be shown.  The Appellant had not done this.

10. On 18th February 2015, permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis
    that the judge had misapplied the Rule in Rodriguez as now confirmed by
    the Court of Appeal.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 8th May 2015, Mr Avery, appearing on behalf
    of the Respondent, relied upon the Grounds of Appeal and submitted that
    the evidence was not submitted in the correct format at the time of the
    application.  Moreover, the Appellant could not  show  that  25  points
    ought to have been awarded on the basis of funds available and that she
    was skilled to the NQF level 4 level.

12. Moreover, when the judge refers to the case of Rodriguez  at  paragraph
    25  of  the  determination,  he  erroneously  refers  to  the  Tribunal
    determination which had been overruled by the Court of Appeal such that
    this in itself was an error.

13. For his part, Mr Gillaro submitted that the reference to  Rodriguez  at
    paragraph 25 was not a material error because what had  happened  since
    then was that the same flexibility policy  had  now  been  incorporated
    into the Immigration Rules.  The judge would properly speaking, to have
    referred to the Immigration Rule, rather  than  to  what  was  said  at
    paragraph 12 of the Tribunal determination.

14. Even so, it was not the case that what was said at paragraph 12 of  the
    determination was wrong.  What was  said  there  was  that  the  policy
    requires the Respondent to notify the Appellant of the  information  on
    shortcomings  in  her  application  so  that  she  can  deal  with  the
    shortcoming.  Subject to this, Mr  Gillaro  relied  upon  his  skeleton
    argument.

15. In reply, Mr Avery submitted that the reference  to  Rodriguez  in  the
    Tribunal was simply wrong.  Moreover, it was  not  the  case  that  the
    Respondent  Secretary  of  State  should  have  used   the   evidential
    flexibility policy to request the Appellant to provide the  information
    in the correct format.  The Secretary of State may or may  not  do  so.
    It was a matter for the Secretary of State.  Finally, the document  was
    not just in the wrong format, it was also the wrong document.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.

17. First, in what is a clear and comprehensive  determination,  the  judge
    makes findings of fact that the Respondent incorrectly  took  only  one
    aspect of the Appellant's self-employed status  into  account,  namely,
    that she worked with a travel agency, and overlooked the fact that  she
    was also the director of a new company.  The judge held that "that  was
    neither fair nor appropriate" (see paragraph 22).

18. Second, the judge went on to hold that the Appellant was registered  as
    a director with the new business, "and that the evidence enclosed  from
    the Companies House included a printout on form  IN01"  and  that  this
    "clearly listed the Appellant as the sole director of  a  company  with
    the document itself confirming authorisation as  well  as  authenticity
    ..." (paragraph 23).  It was on this basis that  the  judge  ultimately
    concluded that, "I am satisfied therefore that this evidence of being a
    director  satisfied  the  requirements  of   the   Immigration   Rules"
    (paragraph 24).  It was only thereafter, however, that the  judge  went
    on to consider, as a separate issue, the application of the "evidential
    flexibility policy" and referred to the case of Rodriguez (at paragraph
    25).

19. Given that the Appellant had provided an IN01 document  from  Companies
    House,  which  listed  her  as  a  sole  director  of  a  company,   in
    circumstances where the Respondent Secretary of State alleged that  she
    had not submitted a Companies House Current  Appointment  Record  which
    showed  her  as  being  so  registered,  this  should  have   put   the
    Respondent's caseworkers on notice that such  a  document  does  indeed
    exist,  although  provided  in  a  different  format,  to  confirm  the
    Appellant's  directorship  of  her  business,  so  as  to  enable   the
    caseworkers to make further enquiries.

20. Under paragraph  245AA(b)(ii)  if  the  information  is  not  in  their
    "correct format", it  could  be  remedied  in  its  deficiency  by  the
    provision of the specified Current Appointment Report  which  confirmed
    the truthfulness of what  was  contained  in  the  IN01  document  from
    Companies House.

21. In short, I find that the error, assuming that  it  exists,  is  not  a
    material error on the part of the judge, because the judge had  already
    allowed the appeal on the basis of  the  findings  of  fact  made  (see
    paragraphs 21 to 24).

22.  Insofar  as  consideration  is  thereafter  given  to  the  evidential
    flexibility  policy,  and  a  reference  is  made   to   the   Tribunal
    determination of Rodriguez which has since been appealed by  the  Court
    of Appeal, there was again no material error of law because  the  Rules
    now expressly refer to documents that are not in the  "correct  format"
    which was precisely the case here.

23. Accordingly, the judge was entitled to allow the appeal as he did.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
