                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Secretary  of  State  in
    relation to a decision and reasons of  Judge  Andonian  promulgated  on
    19th October 2015 after a hearing at Taylor  House  on  25th  September
    2015.  The appeal was in relation to a family of five,  mother,  father
    and their three children all of whom have been in the UK since December
    2001 or rather the First Appellant having been in the  UK  since  2001,
    the second since 2005 and the remaining children since their respective
    dates of birth.  Only one of the children has  been  here  longer  than
    seven years.

 2. The appeal was in relation to a decision to refuse them leave to remain
    under  Paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  Article   8
    generally.  The Secretary of State challenges what is by any  standards
    an extremely brief determination, running to one and a half  pages,  on
    the basis that the judge has  failed  to  apply  binding  case  law  in
    relation to EB (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ  874  and  Zoumbas  [2013]
    UKSC 74 and secondly making a material misdirection in law  in  failing
    to give adequate weight to the public interest factors  highlighted  in
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

 3. In granting permission the First-tier Tribunal Judge granted permission
    on the basis of the grounds noting that it was a case which  turned  on
    the  interference  with  private  life,   there   being   no   proposed
    interference with family  life  as  the  Appellants  would  be  removed
    together. The judge noted that Section  117B  required  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to give little weight to the private lives of these Appellants
    because they had established their private life at  a  time  when  they
    were in the UK unlawfully. The First-tier Tribunal, at paragraph 8, had
    decided that section 117B should not be  applied  in  relation  to  the
    children because as children it was not their fault.

 4. I agree with the judge who granted permission.  Section 117 applies  to
    all applicants and  it  is  not  excluded  because  some  of  them  are
    children.  The judge has signally failed to consider 276ADE  adequately
    or at all in relation to anybody except the child  who  has  been  here
    more than seven years.  Has failed to consider Section  117  adequately
    or at all in relation to anyone  except  that  one  child.   The  judge
    appears to have decided it is unreasonable for that child to go back to
    Nigeria without any consideration of the fact that the child  would  be
    returning with the remainder of its family.

 5. It is a wholly inadequately reasoned decision and it also fails to take
    into account the law which it is required to do and for that  reason  I
    set it aside in its entirety.  To her credit Ms Yong  valiantly  sought
    to defend the decision relying on various pieces of case law  including
    PD and Others (Article 8 Conjoined Family Claims) Sri Lanka [2016] UKUT
    00108 (IAC) and also Treebhawon and Others (Section 117B(6) [2015] UKUT
    00674 (IAC).  The points made by Ms Yong are all valid points but  they
    go to submissions in a substantive appeal and do not rescue what is  an
    unsustainable decision.

 6. Due to the paucity of reasons in the First-tier Tribunal's decision  it
    is appropriate for it to be remitted to the First-tier for a  full  re-
    hearing by another judge.

No anonymity direction is made.
