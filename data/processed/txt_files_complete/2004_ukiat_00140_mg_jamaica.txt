For the Respondent:    No appearance

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Kingston,  appeals  with  permission
    against the determination of an  Adjudicator,  Mr  C  B  Buckwell,  who
    allowed the Respondent's appeal against the decision made on  24  April
    2003 refusing her entry clearance to the United Kingdom as  a  visitor.
    In this determination the Tribunal will refer to the respondent to this
    appeal as the applicant.

2.    The applicant applied for entry clearance on 15 April 2003 for a visa
    to make  a  three  week  visit  to  relatives  in  this  country.   Her
    application was refused for the reasons set out in the  decision  dated
    24 April 2003.  The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the
    cost of the  trip  was  commensurate  with  the  applicant's  financial
    circumstances nor that she had sufficiently  strong  economic  ties  in
    Jamaica to satisfy him that she intended to leave on completion of  her
    proposed visit.  He was not satisfied that she was a genuine visitor.

3.    The applicant appealed against this decision and her appeal was heard
    by the Adjudicator on 6 August 2003.  For the reasons which he has  set
    out in his determination he was  satisfied  that  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41 of HC  395  were  fulfilled,  that  a  genuine  visit  was
    intended and that the applicant would return to Jamaica at the  end  of
    that visit.

4.    He allowed the appeal and went on to direct  that  the  applicant  be
    granted entry clearance as a visitor.  In view of the  time  which  had
    elapsed  he  directed  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  grant  entry
    clearance in consultation with the applicant,  in  order  to  ascertain
    when she would seek to make her rescheduled  visit.   In  the  original
    entry clearance application form she had asked for the visa to be valid
    for two years.  He directed that such a period be accepted.

5.    The grounds of appeal only seek to challenge the  direction  made  by
    the Adjudicator.  It is argued that he had no power in law to make such
    a direction.  Reliance is placed on the authority of Obeid  [1986]  Imm
    AR 341. The grounds also refer to paragraph 5  of  Schedule  4  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and argue that the direction  given  by
    the Adjudicator goes further than giving effect to the determination.

6.    At the hearing before the Adjudicator  there  was  no  appearance  on
    behalf of the applicant.  A letter has been received from  her  sponsor
    dated 10 May 2004 indicating that as her sponsor he is not about to get
    involved in a legal debate between two UK departments.   The  applicant
    would have liked to visit the United Kingdom this time  last  year  and
    would have liked to come this month but had not  been  able  to  do  so
    because of the pending appeal.

7.    In these circumstances the Tribunal will proceed with the hearing  of
    the appeal in the absence of the applicant pursuant to  the  provisions
    of Rule 44 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Appeals  (Procedure)  Rules
    2003.

8.    Mr Parker adopted the grounds  of  appeal  in  his  submissions.   He
    argued that Obeid was rightly decided  and  should  be  followed.   The
    Adjudicator should not  have  given  any  directions.   They  were  not
    necessary to give effect to the determination.

9.    In Obeid the Tribunal held that when an appeal  was  allowed  against
    the refusal of entry clearance in respect of a visitor  application  it
    was inappropriate to give directions for the issue of entry  clearance.
    The Tribunal wrote as follows:

      "The only issue before us concerns the direction of  the  Adjudicator
         when following the allowing of the appeal he directed the issue of
         'the appropriate entry clearance'.  As the Tribunal  has  said  on
         many occasions, the problem with such a direction is that time has
         gone by.  In this case a decision was taken on 20  April  1985  in
         relation to an application to visit the United Kingdom for a  stay
         of up  to  two  months  from  that  date.   Clearly  the  lack  of
         justification of refusal of entry for a proposed  visit  made  for
         express purposes on a different date cannot entitle  a  person  to
         entry clearance for a visit made at a different time  when  indeed
         the purposes themselves  may  have  changed.   Even  assuming  the
         purposes to remain the same, a proposed visitor must  satisfy  the
         Immigration Officer as to maintenance and  accommodation  and  his
         ability to meet the costs of return or onward  journeys.   In  all
         the circumstances of visit  cases,  in  the  Tribunal's  view  the
         normal consequences of the allowing of appeal are simply a finding
         that the refusal of entry was unjustified."


10.   At the hearing the Tribunal referred Mr Parker to  the  determination
    in Sharif [2002] UKIAT 00953.  This was  an  appeal  allowed  on  human
    rights grounds  where  the  Adjudicator  added  a  direction  that  the
    Appellant be granted indefinite leave to remain.  The Tribunal referred
    to the power to give directions in paragraph 21(5) of the Schedule 4 to
    the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The power to make a direction  now
    appears in Section 87(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002.  In paragraph 12 of Sharif the Tribunal wrote as follows:

      "The language at paragraph 21(5)(a) indicates  that  the  Adjudicator
         should only  make  a  direction  if  it  is  indeed  necessary  or
         required, to use the word in the sub-paragraph, to give effect  to
         a determination.  It is true that it is  put  in  the  terms  such
         directions as he thinks are required but it  would  be  irrational
         for him and wrong to make any direction  which  was  not  in  fact
         reasonably required.   Accordingly  the  Adjudicator  was  clearly
         wrong to make the direction that he did and we  therefore  propose
         in accordance with our powers given under paragraph 22(5)  of  the
         Fourth Schedule of the 1999 Act  in  affirming  the  Adjudicator's
         determination to delete the direction that was given."


11.   The Tribunal accepts Mr Parker's submission that the direction  given
    by the Adjudicator was not necessary to give effect  to  his  decision.
    There is no reason to believe that the Entry Clearance Officer will not
    comply with the Adjudicator's determination.  He will still have to  be
    satisfied when the rescheduled visit is made that the  requirements  of
    the Rules are fulfilled. It is  for  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    decide for how  long  the  visa  should  be  valid.   The  Tribunal  is
    satisfied that this direction was not  necessary  for  the  purpose  of
    giving effect to the Adjudicator's determination.

12.   The Adjudicator's decision to allow the appeal on its merits has  not
    been challenged and the Tribunal affirm that decision but we set  aside
    the direction given in paragraph 20 of the Adjudicator's determination.
     We sympathise with the point made by the Sponsor in his letter  of  10
    May 2004 and understand the applicant's frustration at the delay in her
    visit.  Assuming there has been no  drastic  change  in  circumstances,
    there would appear now to be no reason why entry clearance  should  not
    be issued for a rescheduled visit.

13.   The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed to  the  extent  that  the
    direction is deleted.  The decision to allow  the  appeal  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance as a visitor stands  and  is  unaffected  by
    this decision.
