                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  SH
    Smith, promulgated on 17 April 2019. Permission to appeal  was  granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge M Robertson on 15 April 2019.



Anonymity

 2. A direction was made previously and is repeated below given  that  this
    is a protection case involving a particularly vulnerable appellant.

Background

 3. On 21 April 2016, the  appellant  applied  for  asylum  in  the  United
    Kingdom. That claim was based on the appellant being a female victim of
    trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation who had escaped  her
    traffickers, as well as being a lone female from Albania with  a  child
    out of wedlock. A National Referral Mechanism (NRM) decision  was  made
    on 31 October 2016 in which it was concluded that the appellant was not
    a victim of human trafficking.

 4. In the decision letter dated 4 January 2018  refusing  the  appellant's
    claim, the Secretary of State rejected the credibility of her claim  to
    be a victim of trafficking as well as her claim that  she  would  be  a
    single parent without support. Alternatively, it  was  considered  that
    there was a sufficiency of protection in Albanian and  that  she  could
    reasonably be expected to relocate.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the appellant's protection claim
    lacked credibility; that she was an unmarried single parent;  that  the
    psychiatrist had discounted the possibility that her symptoms of trauma
    could be due to the circumstances  of  her  second  child's  conception
    which were "likely to be the cause  of  significant  trauma"  and  that
    there would be no breach of the Article 8 rights of  the  appellant  or
    her children were they to be removed to Albania.

The grounds of appeal

 6. There were six grounds of appeal. Firstly, that the judge erred in  his
    approach to the psychiatric report, primarily because  the  appellant's
    mental health concerns predated the conception  of  her  second  child.
    Secondly, the judge, in rejecting the credibility  of  the  appellant's
    account of being clandestinely transported across Europe overlooked the
    expert and  background  evidence  before  him.   Thirdly,  the  judge's
    credibility findings  were  deficient  in  that  he  misunderstood  the
    evidence and erred in dismissing aspects of the  appellant's  claim  as
    implausible. Fourthly, it was contended that the  judge's  reasons  for
    finding that the appellant had a genuinely subjectively  held  fear  of
    persecution  were  unclear  given  his  conclusion  that  she  was  not
    credible. Fifthly, that the judge's risk  assessment  was  infected  by
    errors amid a failure to consider expert evidence and Country Guidance.
    Lastly, it was argued that  the  judge  erred  in  his  proportionality
    assessment.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on  ground  1,  permission  not  being
    refused on any other ground.

 8. The respondent did not file a Rule 24 response in this case.




The hearing

 9. Ms Fitzsimons relied on the grounds of  appeal  in  full.  She  argued,
    firstly, that at [29]  of  the  decision,  the  judge  found  that  his
    credibility concerns could not be discounted by the psychiatric  report
    of Dr Chiedu Obuaya because the circumstances  of  the  second  child's
    conception were not engaged with. She drew our attention to a  body  of
    medical evidence which was before the judge which showed that there was
    evidence that the appellant was suffering from depression  and  anxiety
    before the second child was born. Ms Fitzsimons argued that the medical
    evidence as a whole supported the view that the  appellant's  PTSD  was
    caused by traumatic events in Albania.  This error was material because
    the judge assessed the medical evidence on a faulty basis and found her
    not to be a credible witness, properly directed a judge could find that
    Dr Obuaya's report was evidence which was probative of her mental state
    or which justified a departure from negative findings.

10. Moving onto the second ground, Ms Fitzsimons argued  that  the  judge's
    finding  that  it  was  not  plausible  that  the  appellant  could  be
    clandestinely transported across Europe took no  account  of  the  fact
    that a trafficking victim might enter countries clandestinely  nor  the
    evidence from Ms Tamara Bennett of the Human Trafficking Foundation. In
    addition, the judge had strayed into giving evidence  at  [34]  in  his
    comments on procedures at ports.

11. Regarding the  third  ground,  Ms  Fitzsimons  criticised  the  judge's
    conclusion at [30] that the criminal  gang  could  have  simply  helped
    themselves to the contents of the fruit machine in order to recover the
    money  they  lost.   She  argued  that  this  finding  overlooked   the
    appellant's consistent account that the debt  involved  was  large  and
    that further that it was speculative for the judge to say how criminals
    would respond. She referred to the body of case law in  which  reliance
    on plausibility was frequently criticised and asked us to note that the
    judge had fallen  into  the  same  error  in  concluding  that  it  was
    implausible that the chief police officer would interrupt his lunch  to
    state that the police were unable to assist the  appellant.  There  was
    similar  criticism  of  the  judge's  finding  at  [35]  that  it   was
    implausible that the appellant would  have  been  able  to  escape  her
    traffickers  without  consideration  of  her  account  of  the   escape
    occurring after both longstanding abuse and a lengthy journey.

12. Ms Fitzsimons  addressed  the  remaining  grounds  relatively  swiftly.
    Regarding the fourth ground, she pointed to a lack of  clarity  in  the
    judge's reasoning at [38] where despite finding the  appellant's  claim
    to lack credibility, he concluded that her subjective fear of  criminal
    gangs was credible. She argued that this finding was unexplained  given
    the judge's conclusion that the appellant was from a progressive middle-
    class family to whom she and  her  children  could  return.  The  fifth
    ground concerned the judge's application of TD and AD  [2016]  UKUT  92
    which was affected by his credibility findings in that the risks to the
    appellant were negated by family support. Ms Fitzsimons had nothing  to
    add regarding the sixth and last ground.







13. Mr Lindsay informed us that the appeal was resisted on all grounds.  He
    described the judge's decision as careful and thorough and asked us  to
    uphold it.  Regarding ground one, Mr Lindsay accepted  that  there  was
    some evidence that appellant had mental health symptoms  prior  to  her
    second pregnancy, however there was still no error of law, material  or
    otherwise.  He contended that the judge did not make a finding that all
    the mental health symptoms were down to the birth of the second  child.
    The key finding of the judge was  that  there  could  have  been  other
    causes for her symptoms and that was not ruled out by the psychiatrist.



14. As for the further grounds, Mr Lindsay endorsed  the  comments  of  the
    judge granting permission, said that they were an  attempt  to  reargue
    the case and did not show any error. He argued that the judge  had  the
    benefit of seeing and hearing the evidence and gave clear  reasons  for
    the  decision  reached  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  should  be  slow  to
    interfere.

15. On the second ground, Mr Lindsay commented  that  this  relied  on  the
    Human Trafficking Foundation report to  which  the  judge  gave  little
    weight.  The judge's reasons in relation to this as well as  the  third
    and fourth grounds were not perverse.  In  relation  to  Ms  Fitzsimons
    reliance on SB (Sri Lanka) [2019] EWCA Civ 160, he emphasised  that  an
    error of logic alone, if not leading to perversity was  not  sufficient
    and that the threshold for perversity had not been lowered  because  of
    this judgment. As for ground five, Mr Linsday  argued  that  the  judge
    considered TD and AD with care and it was not the case that he  treated
    it as a cumulative exercise. Finally,  he  stated  that  there  was  no
    arguable error of approach to the judge's consideration  of  Article  8
    ECHR.

16. In reply, Ms Fitzsimons said that  the  first  ground  did  not  simply
    concern whether the medical report could find alternative  reasons,  it
    was relevant to  how  the  appellant's  evidence  was  construed  as  a
    vulnerable witness and requirement of a decision-maker to  have  regard
    to the opinion of experts, with reference to KV (Sri Lanka) [2019] UKSC
    10. Dr Obuaya had  regard  to  the  appellant's  medical  records,  the
    reasons for refusal of  her  protection  claim  and  had  assessed  the
    appellant and given detailed reasons for the clinical view reached  and
    it was an error for the judge to dismiss this.

17. At the end of the hearing, we reserved our decision as to whether there
    was an error of law and now give our reasons below.

Decision on error of law

18. The judge placed weight on the psychiatric report provided by the Helen
    Bamber Foundation but found that the circumstances of the conception of
    the appellant's  second  child  amounted  to  rape  and  criticised  Dr
    Obuaya's report for not considering whether this "could be the cause of
    her post-traumatic stress  disorder."  We  conclude  there  was  little
    support for this finding.

19. Dr Obuaya interviewed the appellant and took a  detailed  history  from
    her which covered matters  which  had  arisen  in  the  United  Kingdom
    including the circumstances surrounding the conception  of  her  second
    child.

20. At [47] of the psychiatric report Dr Obuaya says as  follows,  "I  have
    considered the possibility that other factors...could have caused  (the
    appellant's)  symptoms."  The  psychiatrist  gives  examples  of  those
    factors in the following way, "such as separation from her partner  and
    country, as well as her  continuing  immigration  uncertainty  and  the
    stress associated with being a single mother." Reading  this  paragraph
    as a whole, we find that it cannot be said that Dr Obuaya  limited  his
    consideration of the importance of peripheral matters to the  diagnoses
    to the three examples he gave. We  are  of  the  view  that  Dr  Obuaya
    considered the entirety of the appellant's circumstances, her demeanour
    and medical history prior to reaching his decision  that  her  symptoms
    were "in keeping with  the  traumatic  experiences  she  has  described
    suffering in Albania. It is my opinion that the onset of her depressive
    and PTSD symptoms was soon after the period that she was  held  against
    her will and sexually assaulted. I note the absence of any  significant
    psychopathology prior to the index trauma."

21.  In addition, there was ample medical evidence provided  to  Dr  Obuaya
    which established that the appellant was suffering from serious  mental
    health issues long before her second  child  was  conceived  in  around
    March 2017. Firstly, in the appellant's first witness statement dated 1
    July 2016, she gave a detailed account of her symptoms  of  depression,
    distress, insomnia and her desire for  help  with  these  matters.  She
    describes these symptoms as starting after her escape from the criminal
    gang. The appellant's account was supported by evidence that she was on
    anti-depressant medication by the end of 2016 as well as her GP records
    which refer to her having therapy during January 2017.

22. The judge's error was material in  that  if  he  had  directed  himself
    properly, he might have found that  the  report  amounted  to  evidence
    which  could  cause  him  to  depart  from  his   subsequent   negative
    credibility findings.

23. The previously  mentioned  error  alone  justifies  setting  aside  the
    decision as a whole however, we  shall  briefly  address  some  of  the
    matters raised in grounds two to five.

24. The judge's credibility findings are expressed between [30] and [37] of
    the decision and reasons. He did not accept that the  criminals  "would
    go to the lengths the  appellant  claims,"  [30].  The  judge  did  not
    consider that the steps taken by the appellant's fianc�, father and the
    chief of police were credible [31-32].  He  did  not  accept  that  the
    appellant was transported in a clandestine way across Europe  [34]  and
    did not accept that it was plausible that the appellant would have been
    under the guard of a single male  who  left  her  unaccompanied.  These
    findings are closer to assertions and are inadequately reasoned.  Those
    findings uniformly concern the plausibility of  the  actions  of  third
    parties, which the appellant would have struggled  to  explain  in  any
    event. The findings do not establish that there was anything inherently
    implausible about any aspect of the appellant's  account.  Furthermore,
    the expert report of Dr Tahiraj provided support  for  the  appellant's
    account of the  traffickers  being  able  to  facilitate  her  movement
    without being flagged  at  the  borders.  There  is  also  the  judge's
    reference to judicial notice at [34] as to the practice at ports in the
    various countries the appellant passed through en route to  the  United
    Kingdom which effectively amounted to giving evidence.

25. The errors summarised in [24] are material because  without  them,  the
    judge would  have  been  left  with  a  consistent  account  which  was
    supported by medical evidence provided by a reputable  charity  and  he
    could easily have reached a different conclusion.

26. We conclude that the First-tier Tribunal made material  errors  of  law
    and set aside the decision with no findings preserved.

27. In considering whether to remit or  retain  the  matter  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, we have  taken  account  of  Ms  Fitzsimons'  request  for  a
    remittal to the First-tier Tribunal. We are also mindful of statement 7
    of the Senior President's Practice Statements of 10 February  2010.  It
    is  the  case  that  the  appellant  has  yet  to  have   an   adequate
    consideration of her asylum appeal at the First-tier  Tribunal  and  it
    would be unfair to deprive her of such consideration.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal is remitted, de novo, to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  reheard
at Hatton Cross, with a time estimate of half a day by any judge
