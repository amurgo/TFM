Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Wells, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant appeals with leave against the  determination  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Malone in which he dismissed the appellant's appeal
    against the decision of the respondent to refuse her entry clearance to
    settle in the UK as the spouse of  Mohammad  Aziz  Qureshi,  a  British
    citizen, present and settled in the UK.   The  appellant's  application
    was refused on 29 November 2012.

2.   The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant's sponsor Mr  Qureshi.
     He also considered the appellant's bundle numbering 180 pages.

3.   The  appellant's  application  was  refused  by  the  respondent  under
    paragraph 281 because the respondent was not  satisfied  that  she  had
    demonstrated  that  her  marriage  to  Mr  Qureshi  was   genuine   and
    subsisting, that they intended to live together permanently as man  and
    wife and that they could maintain and accommodate themselves adequately
    in the UK in accordance with the Immigration Rules.

4.   The judge accepted that the  appellant  had  met  the  maintenance  and
    accommodation requirements of the immigration rules.

5.   The judge stated at paragraph 18 that  having  carefully  analysed  the
    scant evidence, he came to the conclusion that the appellant had failed
    to discharge the burden of  demonstrating  that,  as  at  the  date  of
    decision, her marriage to Mr Qureshi was  genuine  and  subsisting  and
    that they intended to live together permanently as man and wife.

6.   The  judge  considered  what  the  appellant  said  in  the  Notice  of
    Application.  She said that she and Mr Qureshi  had  known  each  other
    since childhood.  They were family friends before their  marriage.   Mr
    Qureshi flew to Pakistan on 10 October 2011.  He and the appellant were
    married on 26 October 2011 in Rawalpindi, the  appellant's  home  city.
    They lived together until 29 October 2011, when Mr Qureshi returned  to
    the UK.  Mr Qureshi then travelled to  Pakistan  on  16  October  2012,
    returning on 31 October 2012.

7.   The judge said he was provided  with  Mr  Qureshi's  telephone  records
    covering the period January 2012 to June 2012.  He was  satisfied  that
    those records showed that Mr Qureshi had made numerous phone  calls  to
    the appellant of significant length.  The significant calls lasted from
    about fourteen minutes to over half an hour.

8.   The only account of physical  contact  between  the  appellant  and  Mr
    Qureshi he had was that of Mr Qureshi.  He claimed, as recorded in  the
    appellant's Notice of Application, that they had lived together  for  a
    period of three days in October 2011, the three days immediately  after
    they got married.  Mr Qureshi said he spent virtually the  entirety  of
    the period he was in Pakistan in October 2012 with the appellant.   The
    judge said  he  had  no  wedding  photographs  or  photographs  of  the
    appellant and Mr Qureshi together at any time and he  had  no  evidence
    whatsoever from the appellant herself.

9.   In arriving at his conclusion, the judge also  took  into  account  the
    copy money transfer receipts showing money being sent to the appellant.
     There were six.  They were respectively dated 2 January 2013, 20 March
    2013, 25 June 2013, 6 July 2013, 5 November 2013 and 11 February  2014.
    Three showed Mr Qureshi as the payer.  The three  other  receipts  were
    from different payers.  Four of the receipts were for payments of �100;
    and one was for �505 and the other for �1,000.   Mr  Qureshi  told  the
    judge "we had sent �500 for gold".  The judge  did  not  know  who  the
    other payers were and more importantly none of the receipts related  to
    payments made before the date of decision.

10.  The judge directed himself as to the standard of  proof  being  on  the
    balance of probabilities and having carefully considered  and  analysed
    the scant evidence he came to the conclusion  that  the  appellant  had
    failed to discharge the burden of demonstrating that, as at the date of
    decision, her marriage to Mr Qureshi was  genuine  and  subsisting  and
    that they intended to live together permanently as man and wife.

11.  Mr Wells essentially argued that the  judge  should  have  allowed  the
    appeal having accepted that Mr Qureshi had made numerous calls  to  the
    appellant of significant length, the payments made by  the  sponsor  to
    the appellant and the sponsor's evidence which, Mr. Wells submitted was
    reliable. The fact that there were no photographs of the appellant  and
    Mr Qureshi together and no witness statement from the appellant did not
    justify the judge's conclusions.  This was  an  arranged  marriage  and
    therefore there was little physical relationship between the  appellant
    and Mr Qureshi.

12.  Mr Wells raised another argument which was not made before  the  judge.
    It was this: that the sponsor had to spend as little time as  he  could
    in Pakistan in order to return to London in order to work to  meet  the
    financial requirement.  This was not  an  argument  that  I  could  not
    consider it.  In any event it would not have made any difference to the
    judge's decision.

13.  I was not persuaded by Mr Wells'  arguments  that  the  judge  made  an
    error of law in his approach to the evidence.  I  accept  Mr  Kandola's
    submission that there was a fundamental problem for the  appellant  and
    the sponsor which was that there was no  evidence  from  the  appellant
    herself.  The ECO was questioning the genuineness of the  marriage  and
    yet there was no evidence from  the  appellant  apart  from  her  entry
    clearance application.  The evidence the judge received was  one-sided.
    It was from the sponsor alone.  The judge did accept that there were  a
    significant number of telephone calls  to  the  appellant  but  in  the
    absence of evidence from  the  appellant,  we  do  not  know  what  her
    intentions are.  Out of the six remittance  receipts  only  three  were
    from the sponsor to the appellant.  Furthermore, as noted by the  judge
    none of the receipts later related to payments made before the date  of
    decision.  Add that to the lack of photographs or evidence of  physical
    contact between the appellant and Mr Qureshi which was limited  to  the
    three days they were together when they got married  and  the  fourteen
    days in October 2012, there was insufficient evidence before the  judge
    to enable him to conclude that the marriage was genuine and  subsisting
    and that they intended to live together as husband and  wife.   On  the
    limited evidence that was before the judge, I find  that  his  findings
    were perfectly sustainable.

14.  The judge  did  not  make  an  error  of  law.   The  judge's  decision
    dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
