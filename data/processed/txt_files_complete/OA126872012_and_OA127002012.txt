Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Hussain Mazloom, and his brother, Hassan Mazloom, dates
    of birth 6.1.10, are citizens of Afghanistan.

 2. These  are  their  appeals  against  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Malins,  promulgated  15.8.14  dismissing  their  linked
    appeals against the decisions of  the  respondent,  dated  14.5.12,  to
    refuse their applications for entry clearance to the United Kingdom for
    settlement as the sons of Sheralam Mazloom.  The Judge heard the appeal
    on 14.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Simpson  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Malins should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    twin appellants claim to be the sons of the sponsor  Sheralam  Mazloom,
    who was granted refugee  status  on  19.5.06  and  in  2011  was  given
    indefinite leave to remain. They sought entry clearance under paragraph
    297 of the Immigration Rules and relying on Afghan birth  certificates.
    In the decision promulgated  on  29.11.13,  Judge  Malins  allowed  the
    appeals of all the family members, including their mother and two older
    brothers,  under paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules, although they
    all remain in Pakistan. As these two appellants  were  born  after  the
    sponsor obtained refugee status in the UK, they could not benefit  from
    paragraph 352D, hence why their applications had been considered  under
    297, which contains  requirements  of  accommodation  and  maintenance,
    which the First-tier Tribunal did not address.

 7. The Entry Clearance Officer  appealed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  which
    remitted the appeals of these two appellants back to Judge Malins for a
    rehearing of their appeals. The appellants accepted that they could not
    meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.  At  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and before me, the only issue was article 8 family life. Judge
    Malins concluded that family life could be enjoyed in Pakistan and thus
    that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was proportionate.

 8. In summary, the grounds of application for permission to appeal  assert
    that the judge:

      a) Erred in finding that family life could be pursued in  Pakistan  as
         the sponsor has no rights of residence in there and is a recognised
         refugee from Afghanistan;

      b) Mistakenly assumed that the appellants have a right of residence in
         Pakistan when they are actually living there illegally as refugees.



 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Simpson simply stated that  she
    found the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  revealed  an  arguable
    material error of law, without actually suggesting what that  error  of
    law is.

10. The relevant facts as found by the First-tier Tribunal,  corrected  for
    errors, are as follows:

11. At the time the sponsor fled Afghanistan for the UK in 2005,  his  wife
    was expecting their second child. Apparently she  and  sons  Omran  and
    Kashmir later went to reside in Pakistan. It is not clear  to  me  when
    that was, but it could not have been at the same time  as  the  sponsor
    left Afghanistan, as Mr Eaton claimed, as their son Kashmir was born in
    Afghanistan on 1.6.05, after the sponsor arrived in the UK in  November
    2005. Their submitted birth certificates, whether genuine or not,  were
    purportedly issued in Afghanistan and I note that the applications made
    in 2012  claim  that  their  residential  address  is  in  Afghanistan.
    However, it appears to be the sponsor's case that since at  least  2007
    his wife and children live in Pakistan with the sponsor's  brother  and
    family, who has a business there. It is also  clear  that  the  sponsor
    regularly visited his family in Pakistan; there is evidence  of  visits
    in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011, and he has  stayed  for  approximately  3
    months in each of those years. These two appellants were  conceived  in
    Pakistan during one of those visits in the summer of 2009 and  born  in
    January 2010, some 4 years after the sponsor first arrived in the UK as
    a refugee.

12. It follows that the judge was in error to suggest at 9(i)  &  (k)  that
    the sponsor had lived with his family  in  Pakistan  between  2003  and
    2005. But the judge was entitled to conclude  that  over  a  period  of
    several years he spent around 25% of his time living with his family in
    Pakistan and to note that he was able  to  travel  freely  on  his  own
    passport and identity to and from Pakistan, encountering no difficulty.
    This was entirely  consistent  with  the  sponsor's  oral  evidence,  a
    situation also noted by the Upper Tribunal.

13. Whilst the mother and the two older children have  entry  clearance  to
    settle in the UK with the sponsor, on the basis of family reunion,  she
    has, understandably, remained in Pakistan with all four children.

14. The sponsor claimed in his oral evidence that he could not go  to  live
    with his family in Pakistan as his life was in danger  there.  He  said
    that was why he never stayed more than 3 months and was  very  careful.
    Judge Malins rejected that claim as being  entirely  inconsistent  with
    the circumstances, as set out at �8 of the decision. That was a finding
    open to the judge on the available evidence.

15. There is no evidence that he or any of  the  family  members  have  any
    right to reside in Pakistan; though at least two of the  children  were
    evidently born  there  and  have  known  nothing  other  than  life  in
    Pakistan. The oldest child may have spent 2-3 years in Afghanistan, but
    will have little recollection as almost all of his life has been  spent
    in Pakistan. The sponsor was living with the family in Pakistan between
    December 2011 and February 2012, shortly before the  applications  were
    made. The question arises as to whether it was open  to  the  judge  on
    those circumstances to conclude that it was reasonable  to  expect  the
    sponsor to continue his family life  with  his  wife  and  children  in
    Pakistan. His witness statement of 3.10.13 asserts that  his  wife  and
    children are in Pakistan illegally and cannot live there on a permanent
    basis. There is no evidence that  they  have  any  difficulties  living
    there. Neither have they made any application for residence status  and
    there has been  no  evidence  as  to  the  residential  status  of  the
    sponsor's brother who provides  the  accommodation  for  the  sponsor's
    family and lives in Pakistan with his own family, running a  successful
    business. Just because the family does not have residential  status  in
    Pakistan it does not necessarily follow that the sponsor and his family
    cannot continue family life in Pakistan, or that it would be reasonable
    to expect them to  do  so  when  he  has  been  unable  to  demonstrate
    sufficient  income  and  circumstances  to  adequately   maintain   and
    accommodate the family in the UK.

16. Mr Eaton relied on H (Somalia) [2004]  UKAIT  00027,  where  the  panel
    found it "cannot be right to approach the  disruption  to  family  life
    which is caused by someone having to flee persecution as a  refugee  as
    if it were of the same nature as someone  who  voluntarily  leaves,  or
    leaves in the normal  course  of  the  changes  to  family  life  which
    naturally occur as children grow up." In that  case  the  sponsor  fled
    Somalia and his family members with whom he had family  life  moved  to
    live with family in Ethiopia. The issue in that case was whether  there
    was family life continuing in a third country, after the  sponsor  fled
    Somalia. The circumstances of that case do  not  lend  themselves  very
    well to the issues in the present, especially since the sponsor and his
    wife chose to  have  children  whilst  they  were  living  together  in
    Pakistan, albeit for temporary periods of about 3 months.

17. In VW (Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5 (see �9 &  �10),  the  sponsor  in  AB
    (Somalia) and his family fled from Somali to Kenya  in  1991  but  were
    harassed as illegals. The sponsor came to the UK, where he was  refused
    refugee status,  but  eventually  granted  ILR.  In  2005  and  at  his
    instruction his family crossed from Somalia to Ethiopia, where they had
    since lived  without  permission  and  in  straightened  circumstances,
    visited there by the sponsor. It was accepted  that  there  was  family
    life with the sponsor. The First-tier Tribunal found that there were no
    insurmountable obstacles to prevent the family from  continuing  family
    life in either Ethiopia or Somalia.

18. At �18 and �19 the Court of Appeal adopted dicta in EB (Kosovo)  [2008]
    UKHL 41, that the "search for a hard-edged or bright-line  rule  to  be
    applied to the generality of cases is incompatible with  the  difficult
    evaluative exercise which article 8 requires," and affirmed  that  "the
    inquiry into proportionality is not a  search  for  (an  insurmountable
    obstacle) and does not end with  its  elimination.  It  is  a  balanced
    judgement of what can reasonably be expected in the light  of  all  the
    material facts." The court went on to find that the  fact  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal were sustainable.  Whether  not  the  test  was
    whether it was reasonable to expect the sponsor to  rejoin  his  family
    rather than bring them to the UK to join him, the  sustainable  finding
    that the former would involve no more than  a  degree  of  hardship  is
    indistinguishable from a finding that it was reasonable to  expect  it.
    At �45 Lord Justice Sedley had cause to  pause  when  considering  that
    there was no evidence that the sponsor, any more than his  family,  had
    any entitlement to reside in Ethiopia. "But this is  not  the  case  of
    enforced break-up, for the parting occurred more or  less  voluntarily.
    It is a case of attempted family reunion in which,  while  an  existing
    family life has been established,  albeit  at  a  distance,  the  moral
    pressures are different. It was in my judgement open to the immigration
    judge to infer that if the sponsor's family could  reside  in  Ethiopia
    without entitlement or leave, he could do so too. In this  respect,  as
    in others, the case differs from VW."

19. The facts of the  present  appeal  are  not  too  dissimilar  from  the
    situation of the sponsor,  his  family,  and  the  appellants  in  this
    appeal. The family has proven that they are able to  live  together  in
    Pakistan without difficulty. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the claim
    that the sponsor's life is in danger there. These two  appellants  were
    in fact born in Pakistan or at the very  least  have  lived  all  their
    lives  to  date  in  Pakistan,  where  they  have  a  home  and  family
    associations with their uncle and his family. Whilst the  sponsor  fled
    from Afghanistan to the UK, his family did  not  need  to  do  so,  and
    eventually, when it is not clear, moved at  the  sponsor's  request  to
    live with or close to his brother in Pakistan, in  Peshawar,  a  tribal
    area close to the Afghan border. Even if the sponsor and the appellants
    and the other members  of  the  family  have  no  right  to  reside  in
    Pakistan, on which there is no evidence either  way,  they  have  shown
    that they can in fact and  in  practice  do  so.  The  judge  correctly
    considered the appellants' circumstances  under  the  rules  and  under
    article 8 ECHR. That  the  family  does  not  have  settled  status  in
    Pakistan is not determinative of article 8 proportionality. It was open
    to the judge on the facts of this case to  conclude  that  family  life
    could be enjoyed in Pakistan and indeed the sponsor  had  enjoyed  such
    family life for lengthy periods on a regular basis, returning to the UK
    as a matter of choice.

20. I am satisfied that on all the circumstances taken into account by  the
    First-tier Tribunal,  the  finding  that  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was entirely proportionate and  not  disproportionate
    to article 8 rights to respect for family life, was  one  open  to  the
    judge and not vitiated by the factual  errors  complained  of.  In  the
    circumstances, there is no material error of law.

Conclusions:

21. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
