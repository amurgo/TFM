For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer

The requirement in paragraph 11 of Appendix C of the  Statement  of  Changes
in the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended)  is  that  the  funds  be
"available". It is unhelpful to try to paraphrase that.

Funds required by paragraph 11 of Appendix C can take the form of  a  credit
card limit.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The first and second appellants are husband and wife.  They  are  both
    citizens of Nigeria.   The  first  appellant  has  appealed  against  a
    decision to refuse to grant further leave to remain in the UK as a Tier
    4 (General) Student Migrant under the points-based system  (PBS).   The
    second appellant has appealed against  a  refusal  to  grant  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as the first appellant's spouse. Her claim
    is dependent on the success of the first appellant's claim.

2.    The appellants completed forms  in  respect  of  the  application  for
    leave to remain on 06.04.10.  They submitted them to the respondent who
    refused them by letter dated 14.06.10.  The reason for refusal was that
    the first appellant had claimed 10  points  under  Appendix  C  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) but the documents he provided did
    not demonstrate that he had been in possession of  the  required  funds
    for 28 days prior to his application.  Therefore the respondent decided
    that the appellant had not  met  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  and
    decided to refuse his application under paragraph 245ZX(d) of the  said
    Rules.  The second  appellant's  application  was  refused  as  it  was
    dependent on the first appellant's application.

3.    The respondent set out the funds required in terms of the  Immigration
    Rules applicable to a person studying at an Inner London  establishment
    with one dependant.  The course fee having been paid, the sum  required
    was �2,666.   The respondent noted that the  documents  submitted  with
    the application showed that in the  period  06.03.10  to  02.04.10  the
    first appellant was in possession of no more than �2,300.07.

4.    The appellants lodged notices of intention to  appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (hereafter "FtT") in which the first appellant sought  to
    argue that the decision was erroneous in that it failed to take account
    of statutory maternity pay (SMP) available to the second appellant, and
    on grounds of the health of the baby  born  to  the  first  and  second
    appellants on 20.04.10 and on grounds relating to errors  of  fact,  it
    having been noted from the decision that the course  fees  referred  to
    were thought to be for  the  first  year  of  the  course.   The  first
    appellant had in fact been granted leave to enter as a student in  2007
    and had been studying in the UK since.

5.    The Tier 4 application form filled in by the first appellant  includes
    at paragraph 9 the following:-

         "The student must have �800 for each calendar month of their course
         up to a maximum of two months.  Please state what this amount is."


      The first appellant filled that in as �1,600.   Paragraph L24  of  the
    same form is in the following terms:-


         "Please tick to  confirm  the  documents  submitted  as  supporting
         evidence to show the student has access to the required  amount  of
         money for maintenance and funds."


    The first appellant ticked the  box  for  "personal  bank  or  building
    society statements".


6.    The form completed by the second appellant at paragraph K13 is in  the
    following terms:- "The dependent must have �533 for each calendar month
    of the main applicant's course up to a maximum of  two  months.  Please
    state what this amount is."  The  second  appellant  filled  it  in  as
    �1,066.


      Paragraph K23 of the same form is in the following terms:-

         "Please tick to  confirm  the  documents  submitted  as  supporting
         evidence that the dependant  have  (sic)  access  to  the  required
         amount of money for maintenance and funds."


    The second appellant did not tick any of the boxes.


7.    The FtT heard the case on 7.10.10.  The  appeals  had  initially  come
    before an Immigration Judge to be decided on the papers.   He  declined
    so to determine the appeals, observing that the  appellants  had  filed
    further documentary  evidence  not  intimated  to  the  respondent  and
    further, that the case of Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719  which  had  been
    decided after the respondent's  refusal  of  the  claim  had  potential
    application.  Directions were given for a skeleton  argument  from  the
    respondent, which was lodged together with copies of the UKBA based PBS
    (maintenance) funds policy document dated 23 July 2010 and  a  copy  of
    two cases, FA and AA (PBS: effect of Pankina) Nigeria [2010] UKUT 00304
    (IAC) and CDS (PBS - "available" - Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT  00305
    (IAC).  By  that  skeleton  argument  the  respondent  noted  that  the
    appellant's wife had a balance in her Halifax  account  of  �390  on  2
    April 2010 making their joint funds �2,590.07 at the highest balance in
    the one month relevant period.  In light of the judgment in the Pankina
    case the respondent submitted that the required  maintenance  level  of
    �2,666.00 was not met on any one day (that being the requirement in the
    guidance issued after Pankina) in the month preceding  the  application
    date.

8.    The FTT found that the SMP on which the appellant sought to  rely  was
    a total sum of �4,987 due to be paid monthly until December 2010.    He
    found, correctly, that the whole amount cannot be  taken  into  account
    because it is paid in instalments and the full amount  would  not  have
    been paid until 12 December 2010.

9.    The Immigration Judge found that, by taking into account  the  sum  in
    the first appellant's bank account together with the sum in the  second
    appellant's bank account for any one day in the 28 days  prior  to  the
    application, the highest sum they had was �2,590.07.  As it was  agreed
    that the sum  required  in  terms  of  the  Rules  was  �2,666.00,  the
    appellants were short by �75.93.

10.   The first appellant produced a letter from his bank, Santander,  which
    the FTT described as undated and which stated  that  he  had  a  credit
    limit on his card of �2,000.   The  Immigration  Judge  found  that  he
    could not take the sum available under the card  into  account  as  the
    burden was on the appellants to show  that  they  "held"  the  required
    level of funds at the closing balance on any one  day  during  the  one
    month period prior to the date of application.

11.   On examination of the documents lodged on  behalf  of  the  appellant,
    the letter referred to by the FTT is properly  described  as  a  credit
    card statement summary.  Although undated it gives the account  summary
    as at 08.04.10 and states that the  credit  limit  is  �2,000  and  the
    amount available to spend as at 08.04.2010 is �1,285.77.

12.   At the hearing before us the appellant stated that he  relied  on  his
    written grounds.  Mr Nath for the respondent  proceeded  on  the  basis
    that the live question before us concerned the correct construction  of
    the Immigration Rules as they relate to money available  by  way  of  a
    loan arranged on a credit card.  He began by describing the question as
    one concerning the availability of funds and in particular whether they
    were  "actively"  available.   He  conceded,  however,  that  the  word
    "actively" was an unwarranted gloss on the statutory requirements.

13.   He  argued  that  the  Immigration  Rules  require  the  funds  to  be
    available and that funds such as those on which the appellant sought to
    rely can be taken away at any time  and  are  therefore  not  available
    funds.  He said that they were in the nature of a privilege rather than
    a loan which was agreed with a binding legal document  in  which  funds
    were payable, for example monthly.   He  argued  that  while  the  bank
    statement made clear that funds could be spent,  there  was  no  formal
    contract between the parties.  In a brief reply, the  appellant  argued
    that the funds were available to him and that they should therefore  be
    seen as fulfilling the requirements of the Rules.

      Our Assessment

14.   We are persuaded that the FtT (First-tier Tribunal)  materially  erred
    in law.  In light of the case of Pankina, referred to  above,  the  FtT
    was required to interpret the words of the  Immigration  Rules  without
    any reliance on the guidance currently published by the respondent.  In
    terms of paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules, an applicant such as
    the first appellant was required to satisfy sub-paragraph  (d)  to  the
    effect that he must have a minimum of ten points under paragraphs 7  to
    13 of Appendix C.   Paragraph 10 states that a Tier 4 (General) Student
    must score 10 points for funds.   Paragraph  11  is  in  the  following
    terms:- "10 points will only be awarded if the funds shown in the table
    below are available to the applicant and  the  applicant  provides  the
    specified documents to show this.  Notes to accompany the table  appear
    below the table." [Emphasis added].  In this case it is not in  dispute
    that the figure  has  been  properly  calculated  as  �2,666.00.    The
    question before the FtT is whether funds to that extent were  available
    on any one day in the month prior to the application, and  it  is  that
    word that has to be interpreted.

15.   We have come to the view that the FtT erred in law in finding that  it
    was necessary that the appellant "held" the funds.  There  is  no  such
    requirement in the terms of paragraph 245ZX of the Rules read  together
    with Appendix C as it applies to Tier 4 (General)  Students.   The  FtT
    wrongly relied for its conclusion on criteria contained in  the  policy
    guidance.  In light of that error we set aside the decision of the FtT.



16.   Having set aside the decision of the FtT, we  turned  to  re-make  the
    decision.  In the case of PO (Points based scheme: maintenance:  loans)
    Nigeria [2009] UKAIT  00047  which  was  decided  before  the  case  of
    Pankina, it was held that in order to comply with the Immigration Rules
    an applicant must comply with the guidance.  The appellant in that case
    had less than the required sum in his  account  but  had  an  overdraft
    facility  available.   It  was  argued  that  a  person  may  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules and guidance read together even if  he  could
    not show possession of the required sum of money but could instead rely
    on an agreement under which he can  draw  that  sum  of  money  from  a
    lender.  The Upper Tribunal were unable to accept that submission.  The
    application itself had been made at a date at which the  guidance  made
    no reference to loans.  The relevant wording in the  guidance  was,  in
    relation to bank statements, that "the balance must always be at  least
    �2,800 or �800 as appropriate."   The  Upper  Tribunal  described  that
    provision as "simple and readily  intelligible."   The  Upper  Tribunal
    found that documents which failed to show a  balance  at  the  required
    level simply are not evidence of the requirements of  the  points-based
    scheme.

17.   We are of the opinion that PO has been overtaken by  the  decision  in
    the Pankina case.  It is now established that policy  guidance  is  not
    part of the Rules. We are bound  simply  to  construe  the  Immigration
    Rules.  We are fortified in that decision by the  case  of  FA  and  AA
    (PBS: effect of Pankina) Nigeria [2010]  UKUT  00304  (IAC)  which  was
    decided after Pankina.  In that case  the  principal  appellant  was  a
    student and her husband's  application  was  dependent  on  hers.   For
    cultural reasons the couple's money  was  in  a  bank  account  in  the
    husband's name alone.   The  Upper  Tribunal  found  that  once  it  is
    established that the policy guidance does not have the  status  of  the
    Immigration Rules for the purpose of immigration appeals  there  is  no
    reason why in a particular case an appellant cannot establish that  she
    has funds available to her from a bank account in her  husband's  name.
    The evidence in the case was that the husband consented to the money in
    his bank account being used for his wife's expenses  and  studying  and
    that he had paid fees to the institution.  The Tribunal held  that  she
    was therefore able to demonstrate that she had funds available to her.

18.   Further, In the case of CDS (PBS - "available"  -  Article  8)  Brazil
    [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC), a case decided on the same day as FA and AA by
    the same Tribunal, it was held that funds are "available" to a claimant
    at the material time if they belong to a third party but that party  is
    shown to be willing to deploy them to  support  the  claimant  for  the
    purpose contemplated.

19.   We find that there is no proper distinction to  be  made  between  the
    situation of the appellant who has funds available to him from his bank
    and that of the appellants in the cases referred to above who had funds
    available from third parties.  Mr Nath, for the respondent, was correct
    to state that this loan arrangement is not formally  constituted  by  a
    loan agreement and has no particular term during which it runs.  We  do
    not agree  with  him,  however,  that  that  is  of  relevance  to  the
    categorisation of the arrangement.  It remains an  arrangement  whereby
    the appellant can, if he so wishes, draw down funds for use by  himself
    and his family.  Had the appellant so wished he  could  have  withdrawn
    funds to the extent of over �1,200 and placed them in  an  account  and
    then shown the respondent evidence of those funds in the  account.   We
    take the view that, in those circumstances, it cannot be argued that he
    has not shown that he has funds available to him in the context of  the
    Immigration Rules.  We mention simply for completeness  that  the  form
    supplied by the respondent for completion by the appellant, as outlined
    above, makes reference to "access" to funds.  While  we  are  bound  to
    have regard only to the Rules, we note that the appellant argues in his
    written grounds that it is not made clear that funds must be in a  bank
    account and in light of the wording in the  form  we  are  inclined  to
    agree that he may be correct.

20.   We were not asked to reconsider  the  decision  made  by  the  FtT  on
    Article 8 grounds and therefore have not done so.

21.   To summarise:

      The FtT materially erred in law and we set aside its decision.

    The decision we re-make is to allow the appellants' appeals.
