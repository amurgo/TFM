Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms L Kenny, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms F Shaw, instructed by Adam Bernard Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. Whilst this is an appeal by the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
         Department for convenience I will  refer  to  the  parties  in  the
         determination as they appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.

      2. The first and third appellants are the parents of  the  second  and
         third appellants.  The  children  are  Irish  nationals  and  their
         parents are Nigerian nationals.  They all appealed  to  the  First-
         tier Tribunal against decisions of the Secretary of State to refuse
         the  first  and  third  appellant's  applications   for   permanent
         residence cards and the second and fourth appellant's  applications
         for  permanent  residence  registration  certificates   under   the
         Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006  (the  EEA  Regulations).  The
         children had been issued with registration certificates on 8  March
         2006 on the basis that they were self-sufficient as they were being
         supported by a UK sponsor and their parents were issued with  leave
         to remain under the Immigration Rules in line with  that  of  their
         children until 8 March 2011. Since then they have made a number  of
         applications culminating in the  current  applications  which  were
         refused on 6 February 2014. The  Secretary  of  State  refused  the
         parents' applications because parents  or  primary  carers  have  a
         derivative right of residence and are  not  entitled  to  permanent
         residence under European law and because in any event the leave  to
         remain issued to the parents was under the Immigration Rules  which
         applied at that time and cannot amount to residence under  the  EEA
         Regulations. The children's applications were refused on the  basis
         that they did not have comprehensive medical insurance nor had they
         provided evidence of sufficient  funds  to  prevent  them  being  a
         burden on the State  as  required  to  show  that  they  are  self-
         sufficient.

      3. First-tier Tribunal Judge MPW Harris allowed the appeals. The Judge
         noted that the presenting officer conceded that the evidence in the
         appeal met the requirements of regulation 4 (1) (d) (i),  (ii)  and
         (iii) for the claimed period [14]. On that basis  the  Judge  found
         that the children had demonstrated that they were exercising treaty
         rights through being students for a continuous period of at least 5
         years. The Judge was satisfied that the children had established  a
         permanent right of residence. The  Judge  was  satisfied  that  the
         parents are the primary carers of the children and, being satisfied
         that the children were self-sufficient within regulation 4 (c),  he
         found that the parents were  therefore  entitled  to  a  derivative
         right of residence under  regulation  15A  (2)  and  allowed  their
         appeals on that basis.

Error of Law

      4. In her grounds of appeal the Secretary of State contends  that  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in his findings  because  there  is
         insufficient evidence that the appellants  are  self-sufficient  or
         that the children have had comprehensive sickness insurance for the
         full five year period.

      5. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that, in light of the
         presenting officer's note appended to the grounds of appeal, it  is
         arguable that the concessions referred to in the determination have
         been extended beyond what was said.

      6. At the hearing before me I advised the parties that the  record  of
         proceedings indicated that the presenting officer at the First-tier
         Tribunal  had  accepted  that  there  was  evidence   as   to   the
         comprehensive sickness insurance but that the other matters in  the
         appeal were in dispute. Ms Shaw accepted that there was no evidence
         to show that the concession extended to all of the issues and  that
         the Judge did not make findings in relation to all of the issues.

      7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no findings in relation  to  the
         Article 8 appeals which were mentioned in the grounds of appeal  to
         the First-tier Tribunal. His failure to do so  was  not  challenged
         and the parties made no reference to these grounds before me.

      8. I was satisfied that the Judge erred in that he misinterpreted  the
         terms of the concession made by the Home Office Presenting  Officer
         and failed to make findings on the issues to be determined  in  the
         appeal or to give reasons for his  conclusions  that  the  children
         were entitled  to  permanent  residence  and  their  parents  to  a
         derivative right of residence. I therefore set aside  the  decision
         of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

Remaking the decision

      9.  The appellants submitted a new bundle of documents for  the  Upper
         Tribunal in accordance with  the  procedure  Immigration  Rules.  I
         considered this evidence along with the oral evidence of the  third
         appellant, Rebecca Bolanle Opemiyan. The  third  appellant  adopted
         the contents of her statement dated 21 November 2014. She said that
         she has not lived anywhere other than the UK since  February  2005.
         She said that the children, now aged 14 and 12, have been in the UK
         since they were 9 and 7 and they have been in school  since  coming
         to the UK. She said that  they  family  have  had  private  medical
         insurance continuously since coming to the UK.  She  said  that  Mr
         Odwale Odesanya is a family friend who she  has  known  since  they
         were young in Nigeria. He assists the family by giving them  around
         �500 every month. She said that  they  spend  the  money  on  rent,
         clothes and food. She said that the money  he  gives  them  is  not
         enough and that they receive additional money from the Church where
         they worship.

The second and fourth appellants (the children)

     10. The basis of the applications to the  Home  Office  were  that  the
         children  have  acquired  permanent  residence  through  continuous
         residence in the UK as students in accordance with regulation 4 for
         five years under regulation 15  (1).  The  relevant  provisions  of
         Regulation 4 for the purposes of this appeal are as follows;

             4. (1) In these Regulations -

                  ...

                  (c) "self-sufficient person" means a person who has-

                      (i) sufficient resources not to become a burden on
                      the social assistance system of the United Kingdom
                      during his period of residence; and

                      (ii) comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the
                      United Kingdom;

                  (d)"student" means a person who-

                      (i) is enrolled, for the principal purpose of
                      following a course of study (including vocational
                      training), at a public or private establishment which
                      is-

                           (aa) financed from public funds; or

                           (bb) otherwise recognised by the Secretary of
                           State as an establishment which has been
                           accredited for the purpose of providing such
                           courses or training within the law or
                           administrative practice of the part of the United
                           Kingdom in which the establishment is located;

                      (ii) has comprehensive sickness insurance cover in
                      the United Kingdom; and

                      (iii) assures the Secretary of State, by means of a
                      declaration, or by such equivalent means as the
                      person may choose, that he has sufficient resources
                      not to become a burden on the social assistance
                      system of the United Kingdom during his period of
                      residence.

     11. The children must therefore show that throughout a five year period
         they have been enrolled in school as set out in  regulation  4  (1)
         (d) (i); they have been continuously resident in the UK; they  have
         had comprehensive sickness insurance; and they have had  sufficient
         resources throughout that period not to have become a burden on the
         UK's social assistance system.

     12. The letters and documents before me from St James  Hatcham  primary
         school and Deptford Green School confirm that the second  appellant
         has been attending school continuously since 26 September 2005  and
         the  fourth  appellant  since  8  December  2006.  I  am  therefore
         satisfied that they met regulation 4 (1) (d) (i) since each started
         school.

     13. The documents in  the  appellants  bundle  confirm  that  all  four
         appellants have been covered by private health insurance  from  HSA
         and then Aviva, since 1 September 2007. I  am  therefore  satisfied
         that the children met the requirements of regulation (1)  (d)  (ii)
         since that date.

     14. Although accepting that they were self-sufficient at  the  date  of
         the issue of their residence cards in 2006 the Secretary  of  State
         said in the Reasons for Refusal letters that she was not  satisfied
         that the children had shown that  they  have  been  self-sufficient
         throughout the period since then.

     15. In their statements the first and  third  appellants  say  that  Mr
         Odesanya has been  financially  supporting  the  children.  In  his
         letter Mr Odesanya says that he  has  been  supporting  the  family
         since 2005. However his letter is undated  and  this  is  the  same
         letter as that in the appellant's First-tier Tribunal bundle. There
         is therefore no up to date  evidence  from  Mr  Odesanya  and  that
         letter could have been written at any times since 2005. There is no
         witness statement from Mr Odesanya and he did not  attend  to  give
         evidence at the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal  or  before  me.
         In her oral evidence the third  appellant  said  that  Mr  Odesanya
         givens them �500 per month. Although some of Mr Odesanya's payslips
         and a bank statement have been submitted there is  no  evidence  of
         any transfer of funds from  Mr  Odesanya  to  the  appellants.  The
         recent bank statement covers a period of  only  five  days  and  is
         insufficient evidence to demonstrate  that  Mr  Odesanya  has  been
         supporting the family for five years as he claims and that  he  has
         been giving the family �500 a week as the third appellant claims.

     16. In oral evidence  the  third  appellant  said  that  the  money  Mr
         Odesanya gives them is not enough and that they  are  supported  by
         their Church. However  there  is  no  evidence  of  such  financial
         support. Further, there is no evidence of the appellants'  finances
         in the form of bank statements to support  the  witness  statements
         and oral evidence.

     17. On the basis of the evidence before me I am not satisfied that  the
         second  and  fourth  appellants  have  had   sufficient   resources
         throughout the period of their residence in the UK  to  demonstrate
         that they met the requirements of 4 (1) (d) (iii) for a  continuous
         period of five years. They have  not  therefore  demonstrated  that
         they  have  acquired  permanent  residence   in   accordance   with
         regulation 15 (1).

The first and third appellants (the parents)

     18. The parents claim to have a derivative right of residence based  on
         the rights of their children. I am not satisfied that the  children
         have acquired permanent residence in  the  UK.  Further,  there  is
         insufficient evidence to demonstrate that they currently  meet  the
         requirements of  regulation  4  (1)  (d)  (iii).  The  parents  are
         entitled to a derivative right of residence  under  regulation  15A
         if, inter alia, they are the primary carer of an EEA  national  who
         is residing in the UK as a self-sufficient person  (regulation  15A
         (2)). Under regulation 4 (1) (c ) as well as  having  comprehensive
         sickness insurance a self-sufficient person  must  have  sufficient
         resources not to become a burden on the social assistance system of
         the  United  Kingdom  during  his  period  of  residence.  The  EEA
         nationals have  not  shown  that  they  have  sufficient  resources
         therefore the parents cannot be entitled to a derivative  right  of
         residence. Further, even if the first and  third  appellants  could
         demonstrate that they have been residing in the UK for a continuous
         period of five years with a derivative right  of  residence,  which
         they cannot, regulation 15 (1A) precludes  them  from  acquiring  a
         permanent right of residence.

     19. The first and third appellants have not demonstrated that they meet
         the requirements of regulation 15 or 15A.

Conclusion:

         The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve
         the making of an error on point of law.

         I set it aside and remake the decision.

         I dismiss all four appeals under the EEA Regulations.
