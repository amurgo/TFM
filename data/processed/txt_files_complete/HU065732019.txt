                            DECISION AND REASONS

Remote Hearing


   1. The hearing before me on 1st June 2021 was a remote video hearing held
      during the Covid-19 pandemic. Neither party objected to a remote
      hearing. The appellant did not join the hearing but her partner and
      sponsor, Mr Manh Cuong Le did join the hearing remotely.  He informed
      me that the appellant no longer has any legal representation. The
      sponsor was assisted throughout the hearing by a Vietnamese
      interpreter arranged by the Tribunal.  The sponsor and interpreter
      introduced themselves and established that they were able to
      communicate with each other effectively, and they were able to hear
      and understand each other.


   2. I sat at the Birmingham Civil Justice Centre.  I was addressed by the
      parties in exactly the same way as I would have been if the parties
      had attended the hearing together.  I was satisfied: that no party has
      been prejudiced; and that, insofar as there has been any restriction
      on a right or interest, it is justified as necessary and
      proportionate.  I was satisfied that it is in the interests of justice
      and in accordance with the overriding objective to proceed with a
      remote hearing because of the need to take precautions against the
      spread of Covid-19, and to avoid delay.  I was satisfied that a remote
      hearing will ensure the matter is dealt with fairly and justly in a
      way that is proportionate to the importance of the case, the
      complexity of the issues that arise, and the anticipated costs and
      resources of the parties.  No technical problems were reported to me
      by the parties during the course of the hearing.  At the end of the
      hearing I was satisfied that both parties had been able to participate
      fully in the proceedings.


Introduction


   3. The appellant is a national of Vietnam.  On 9th December 2018 she made
      an application for leave to enter the UK under Appendix FM of the
      Immigration Rules on the basis of her family life with her partner.
      The application was refused by the respondent for reasons set out in a
      decision dated 20th March 2019. The respondent accepted the
      application did not fall for refusal grounds of suitability. The
      respondent also accepted the appellant meets the eligibility
      relationship requirements and the eligibility English language
      requirement. The respondent concluded that the eligibility financial
      requirement is not met by the appellant.  The respondent considered
      whether there are any exceptional circumstances for the purposes of
      paragraphs GEN.3.1 and GEN.3.2 which could render refusal of entry
      clearance a breach of Article 8 because the refusal could result in
      unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellant, her partner or
      relevant child.  That included a consideration of whether the
      financial requirement is met through taking into account other sources
      of income, including any credible prospective earnings.  The
      respondent concluded that there are no such exceptional circumstances,
      and the appellant cannot satisfy the minimum income requirement set
      out in the rules.  The appellant's appeal against that decision was
      dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Housego for reasons set out in
      a decision promulgated on 13th January 2021.


The appeal before me


   4. The appellant's grounds of appeal are dated 3rd February 2020 and were
      settled by Counsel that represented the appellant at the hearing
      before the First-tier Tribunal.  The appellant advanced five grounds
      of appeal.  First she claims Judge Housego misdirected himself in law,
      at paragraph [51], when requiring there to be 'exceptional
      circumstances' before reliance could be placed upon GEN.3.1(1) of
      Appendix FM.  Second, it was Wednesbury unreasonable for the judge to
      find on the facts that GEN.3.1(2) was not satisfied particularly given
      the significant weight accorded by GEN.3.3(1) of Appendix FM to
      relevant children.  Third, Judge Housego erred in law in his approach
      as to whether paragraph 21A(2)(b) of Appendix FM-Se was met on the
      evidence. It is said Judge Housego failed to take into account
      relevant evidence and gave inadequate reasons for finding that the
      letter from the perspective employer was not a genuine offer of
      employment. Fourth, Judge Housego failed to conduct a lawful best
      interests assessment of the relevant children pursuant to s55.  Fifth,
      Judge Housego made perverse findings in relation to GEN.3.2(2) of
      Appendix FM and finally, Judge Housego made a Wednesbury unreasonable
      finding in paragraph [53.13] of his decision when stating that the
      sponsor was not integrated into UK society because he chose to use the
      services of a Vietnamese interpreter when giving his evidence.


   5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Loke on
      23rd April 2020.  She said:


         "1.  The judge did not misdirect himself regarding the application
         of GEN.3.1.  Exceptionality is contained in the second limb of the
         test at GEN.3.1.(1)(b), in that the judge had to consider whether
         refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences.


         2.   However, it is arguable that the judge did not conduct an
         adequate section 55 assessment as to the best interests of the
         appellant's child."


   6. The respondent filed written submissions dated 23rd July 2020 in
      accordance with directions made by Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on 1st
      July 2020.  The respondent noted that despite the observations made by
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Loke on 23rd April 2020 which purported to
      exclude the grounds regarding the application of GEN.3.1, the states;
      "Permission to appeal is GRANTED". In light of Safi and others
      (permission to appeal decisions) [2018] UKUT 388 (IAC), the grant was
      therefore unrestricted.  The respondent therefore responded to the
      claims made by the appellant in the grounds of appeal.  The respondent
      opposes the appeal and submits that when read as a whole, the decision
      of Judge Housego demonstrates the Judge had proper regard to all
      relevant factors when reaching his decision.  The respondent claims
      the grounds of appeal proceed on an erroneous understanding of the
      relevant terminology.  The respondent submits GEN.3.2 of Appendix FM
      ensures any assessment of factors relating to the appellant's family
      or private life that are not incorporated within other provisions of
      Appendix FM, are subsumed within the immigration rules by ensuring
      decision makers consider whether there are exceptional circumstances
      which would render refusal of entry clearance a breach of Article 8
      because such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences
      for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child or another family
      member whose Article 8 rights would be affected by the decision to
      refuse the application. The respondent submits Judge Housego had
      proper regard to the evidence relating to the three children, all of
      whom are British citizens, that live with the sponsor and the findings
      and conclusions reached by the judge were open to him, and are
      neither, Wednesbury unreasonable, irrational nor perverse.  The
      respondent submits Judge Housego carefully considered the evidence
      before the Tribunal regarding the employment of the sponsor, and
      carefully considered whether there are credible prospective earnings
      that would be available to the appellant and should be taken into
      account.  Furthermore, the respondent submits Judge Housego considered
      the best interests of the appellant's child, noting the age of the
      child, and the fact that the appellant's child has lived with her
      father (the sponsor) for a number of years and the parties have never
      lived together as a family unit.


   7. Although the appellant was unrepresented at the hearing before me, in
      response to previous directions made by the Tribunal, the appellant
      has filed a written reply dated 1st August 2020 and for the avoidance
      of any doubt, I have had regard to the matters set out in that reply
      when reaching my decision.  The appellant refers to the explanatory
      note to the Statement of Changes HC 290 which confirms GEN.3.1 to 3.3
      were provisions introduced into the rules to give effect to findings
      made by the Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) -v- SSHD [2017] UKSC 10,
      which included a requirement for decision-makers to have regard, as a
      primary consideration, to the best interests of any child affected by
      the decision thereby giving explicit effect within Appendix FM to the
      respondent's duty under s55 of the Borders, Citizenship, and
      Immigration Act 2009.  The appellant maintains Judge Housego
      misdirected himself by failing to ask, as he was required to by
      GEN.3.1(1)(b), whether, taking account of the best interests of the
      relevant children (and particularly the biological child of the
      appellant), it was evident that there were exceptional circumstances
      which could (the appellant's emphasis) render refusal of entry
      clearance a breach of Article 8 because such refusal could result in
      unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellant, the sponsor or the
      relevant children. The appellant submits that instead, Judge Housego
      asked whether there were exceptional circumstances which would (the
      appellant's emphasis) render refusal a breach because such refusal
      would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences.  The appellant
      maintains Judge Housego gave no adequate  reasons for finding that
      GEN.3.3(1)(b) of Appendix FM was not met on the facts, and appellant's
      case that refusal of entry clearance could result in unjustifiably
      harsh consequences for either the appellant, child or sponsor, if the
      family is not reunited.  The appellant also maintains Judge Housego
      erred in the assessment of the prospective earnings that would be
      available to the appellant from suitable employment.  The appellant
      also maintains Judge Housego failed to carry out a lawful and adequate
      assessment of the best interests of the children and erroneously gave
      undue weight to the decision by the sponsor to elect to use an
      interpreter when giving his evidence.


   8. At the hearing before me, Mr Manh Cuong Le submitted that he is
      responsible for the care of three children and can only work part
      time.  He said that 3 months ago, he had a stroke in a rest-room and
      he is afraid that if something happens to him, no-one will be able to
      take care of the children.  He told me that he could not recall the
      date that he had a stroke, but it was after the decision of the First-
      tier Tribunal.  He said that when he had the stroke the children were
      at school, and he fell when he went to the rest room.  He accepts that
      he does not have sufficient income to satisfy the income requirements
      set out in the immigration rules but explained that that is because he
      is caring for three children, and he can only work at the weekend.  He
      said that when he goes to work, he has to take the youngest child with
      him, whilst the two older ones look after themselves at home.  He said
      that if the appellant cannot join him in the UK, he would be afraid to
      take the children to Vietnam because there are cases where the
      children have been taken to Vietnam and the children have been taken
      so that they cannot return to the UK.


Discussion


   9. I deal first with the appellant's claim that Judge Housego misdirected
      himself as to the application of GEN.3.1 of Appendix FM and in
      reaching his conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish
      that there are credible prospective earnings available to the
      appellant.  There is no doubt the appellant could not satisfy the
      minimum income requirement set out in paragraph E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix
      FM.  That is a requirement that the applicant must provide specified
      evidence, from the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2. of a
      specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.  It is
      uncontroversial that the sponsor's earnings relied upon by the
      appellant disclose an income of �6144 a year.  That is not the end of
      the matter because the minimum income requirement is subject to what
      is said  in paragraph GEN.3.1 of Appendix FM.  It is useful to begin
      by referring to the relevant Immigration Rules:


         Exceptional circumstances


              GEN.3.1.(1) Where:


         (a) the financial requirement in paragraph E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1.
         (in the context of an application for limited leave to remain as a
         partner), E-ECC.2.1. or E-LTRC.2.1. applies, and is not met from
         the specified sources referred to in the relevant paragraph; and


         (b) it is evident from the information provided by the applicant
         that there are exceptional circumstances which could render refusal
         of entry clearance or leave to remain a breach of Article 8 of the
         European Convention on Human Rights, because such refusal could
         result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their
         partner or a relevant child; then the decision-maker must consider
         whether such financial requirement is met through taking into
         account the sources of income, financial support or funds set out
         in paragraph 21A(2) of Appendix FM-SE (subject to the
         considerations in sub-paragraphs (3) to (8) of that paragraph).


         ...






         Other sources of income, financial support or funds in exceptional
         circumstances

         21A(1). Where paragraph GEN.3.1.(1) of Appendix FM applies, the
         decision-maker
         is required to take into account the sources of income, financial
         support or funds
         specified in sub-paragraph (2).


         (2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) to (8), the following sources of
         income, financial
         support or funds will be taken into account (in addition to those
         set out in, as
         appropriate, paragraph E-ECP.3.2., E-LTRP.3.2., E-ECC.2.2. or E-
         LTRC.2.2. of
         Appendix FM):


         ...


         (b) credible prospective earnings from the sustainable employment
         or self-
         employment of the applicant or their partner; or


         ...




  10. Judge Housego addressed the issue at paragraphs [48] to [51] of his
      decision.  He noted the appellant's reliance upon a letter from the
      employer of the sponsor referring to prospective employment that will
      be available to the appellant.  It is clear from the formulation of
      paragraph GEN.1.1.(b) that it is a pre-condition to any consideration
      of whether the eligibility financial requirement is met through taking
      into account the sources of income, financial support or funds set out
      in paragraph 21A(2) of Appendix FM-SE, that there are exceptional
      circumstances which could (my emphasis) render refusal of entry
      clearance or leave to remain a breach of Article 8 of the European
      Convention on Human Rights, because such refusal could (my emphasis)
      result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their
      partner or a relevant child.  Judge Housego found that there were no
      such exceptional circumstances for the reasons set out at paragraph
      [51] of his decision.  The conclusion reached was one that in my
      judgment is neither Wednesbury unreasonable nor irrational and was
      open to the Judge.  In any event, even if one were to accept that
      there are exceptional circumstances, that could render refusal a
      breach of Article 8, it is clear from what is said at paragraphs [48]
      to [50] that Judge Housego carefully considered the evidence before
      the Tribunal regarding the prospective employment that the appellant
      relied upon as being available to her upon her arrival in the UK. In
      reaching his decision Judge Housego referred to the evidence set out
      in the letter from the employer, and carefully considered the oral
      evidence given by the sponsor. He had regard to the claim made in the
      letter that the appellant would be engaged in cleaning and customer
      support, and the evidence of the sponsor that he did all the cleaning
      at the place of business, and the appellant would be a trainee nail
      technician.  At paragraph [53.10] Judge Housego found the letter
      offering the appellant work at the nail bar where the sponsor works,
      is not a genuine offer. It was, on the evidence, open to Judge Housego
      to find there is no role for the appellant and the appellant has
      failed to establish credible prospective earnings from sustainable
      employment, which taken together with the earnings of the sponsor
      establish that the minimum income requirement is met.


  11. I also reject the claim that Judge Housego erred in his assessment of
      the best interests of the children.  The s55 duty to have regard to
      the best interests of a child applies when considering the
      proportionally assessment.  The best interests of a child are usually
      best served by being with both or at least one of their parents.


  12. The decision must be read as a whole.  It is in my judgement clear
      that Judge Housego had in mind throughout, the best interests of the
      children and the circumstances in which the appellant and her child in
      particular, find themselves in.  He noted, at [40], that the appellant
      lives with her parents in Vietnam and she has a daughter, who is a
      British citizen.  He noted, at [42], that the appellant's daughter was
      about a year old when she came to the UK and where she has since
      remained. He noted she has always lived with her father and that the
      sponsor's child by his former wife, and the child of his elder son,
      also live with them.  At paragraph [53] he noted the appellant's child
      is now five of age and the situation now is as chosen by her parents,
      and that the child now attends primary school with no problems
      reported.  He found the appellant's child is also a Vietnamese
      citizen. He noted that there has never been a family unit comprising
      of the appellant, the sponsor and their child so that the decision of
      the respondent to refuse the application for entry clearance does not
      interfere with any existing family life.  He found, at [53.12], that
      it would not be unreasonable for the appellant's child to go to
      Vietnam with her father to join her mother and grandparents. He found
      that the sponsor has no other family in the UK and that if the parents
      decide they wish to be together in Vietnam, that is feasible on the
      evidence before the Tribunal.


  13. At paragraph [53.13], Judge Housego also considered the care provided
      by the sponsor to his child from a previous relationship and his
      grandson.  It is in my judgement clear that there was insufficient
      evidence before Judge Housego regarding the two other children (i.e.
      the sponsor's child from his previous relationship and his grandson)
      to establish that the two would be unable to live in Vietnam or of any
      adverse impact arising from the decision to refuse the appellant entry
      clearance, sufficient to warrant the appeal being allowed.


  14. The assessment of what is in the best interests of a child is
      inherently fact sensitive and the First-tier Tribunal must carry out
      the assessment on the evidence before it. In reaching his decision
      Judge Housego plainly had regarded to the factors that weigh in favour
      of the appellant and those that way against her in his assessment of
      proportionality. Judge Housego considered all relevant matters
      holistically with the required degree of anxious scrutiny.  It is
      clear that the intention of the sponsor and the appellant is to bring
      their family together in United Kingdom, but Article 8 does not give a
      person the right to choose where they wish to live. In this case the
      Judge gives adequate reasons to support the conclusions he reached,
      and in my judgment the decision reached was one that was open to the
      Judge.  The Judge's reference to the sponsor requiring an interpreter
      must be read in context but even if it was erroneous, it was not
      material to the outcome of the appeal.


  15. It follows that in my judgment, there is no material error of law in
      the decision of Judge Housego, and I dismiss the appeal.


Decision


  16. The appeal is dismissed.  The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
      Housego promulgated on 13th January 2020 shall stand.
