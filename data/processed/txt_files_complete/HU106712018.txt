Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr John McGirr, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Zain Malik, instructed by AWS Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and to avoid confusion I shall refer  to  the  Secretary  of
    State as being, "the claimant".  The respondent is a citizen  of  India
    who was born on 25th October 1984.

2.   The  respondent  appealed  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  against  the
    claimant's  decision  of  26th  April,  2018  refusing  to  grant   him
    indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of having
    completed ten years residency.  His  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Bibi, sitting at Taylor House  on  15th  November  2018.
    The claimant asserted that the  respondent's  immigration  history  and
    documents provided meant that his application fell  for  refusal  under
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

3.   As part of his previous Tier 1 (General) leave application dated  April
    2011, the claimant's records showed that  the  respondent  had  claimed
    that his previous earnings were �36,475.0,7  covering  the  period  1st
    April, 2010 to 1st April 2012.  The claimant also claimed that as  part
    of a Tier 1 (General) leave to remain application dated 29th May  2013,
    Home Office records  showed  that  the  respondent's  claimed  previous
    earnings were �35,886.13 during the period 6th May, 2012  to  5th  May,
    2013.  However information provided to the claimant by  HMRC  showed  a
    different situation.  This showed a lower income. In the  case  of  one
    complete financial year it showed difference  of  some  �9,000  and  in
    another financial year it showed a difference of �4,000.  In  the  year
    2013/2014 a similar comparison showed a difference of just under  �200.



4.   The claimant did not accept  the  respondent's  explanation  for  these
    errors which he said were errors made by his previous accountants.  The
    claimant concluded that the respondent had been deceitful or  dishonest
    in his dealings with either the Revenue or with the UK Borders  Agency.
    The claimant concluded that the respondent amended his tax return  only
    when intending to submit an application for settlement.

5.   The judge examined all the evidence and this included a statement  from
    the respondent's current accountant.  The judge was satisfied that  the
    claimant had discharged the evidential burden by supplying evidence  of
    significant discrepancies between the income figures submitted  by  the
    respondent to HMRC for the purposes of tax and those submitted  to  the
    claimant for the purpose of obtaining leave.  She correctly went on  to
    address the issue of discrepancy, but she found that the respondent had
    put forward an innocent explanation for the  discrepancy  for  the  tax
    year 2013/2014,  indeed  she  was  satisfied  as  to  the  respondent's
    explanations for the  three  discrepancies.   She  concluded  that  the
    respondent had been credible and noted that he paid back overdue tax to
    HM  Revenue  and  Customs,  acknowledging  the  error   made   by   his
    accountants.  She concluded that the claimant had  not  discharged  the
    burden of demonstrating that it was not probable  that  the  respondent
    used deception in declaring his income to either HMRC or  inflated  his
    earnings to the claimant.  What she said at paragraph 49 is this,

         "The most that can be said about him is that he was somewhat na�ve,
         placed too much trust in his  accountant  and  failed  to  exercise
         sufficient scrutiny himself of the figures they  submitted  to  the
         HMRC on his behalf.  The refusal is right to say that the  ultimate
         responsibility for ensuring that the correct information  is  given
         to HMRC fell on the respondent rather than  his  accountants.   Yet
         the [claimant] does not (and realistically could  not)  argue  that
         this was to amount to  conduct  or  character  such  as  to  engage
         paragraph 322(5)."


    She refers there to AA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State [2010]  EWCA  Civ
    773.  She found at paragraph 50 that the respondent's factual basis for
    engaging  paragraph  322(5)  was  not  made  out.   She   allowed   the
    respondent's appeals.

6.   I am most grateful to Mr  Malik  and  to  Mr  McGirr  today  for  their
    assistance.  Mr Malik who was also Counsel in Khan v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department  (dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph  322(5))
    [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) pointed out that it was a decision in a  judicial
    review.  He took me to the guidance at paragraph 37 and I feel I can do
    no more than to express the hope that in future if similar applications
    are  made  by  applicants  that  Presenting  Officers  are   asked   to
    familiarise themselves with paragraph 37 of the decision and not simply
    the headnote.


      "37.   In order not to fall into the trap which I consider that  the
      Secretary of State (or those acting on her behalf) fell into on  this
      occasion, it may assist for me to give some guidance in  relation  to
      the decision-making  process  where  there  have  been  discrepancies
      between previous  applications  for  Leave  to  Remain  (with  points
      claimed on the basis of earnings or profits) and  tax  returns  which
      have been made covering the same period. This guidance stems from  my
      observations at paragraphs 32-34 above:


        (i)            Where  there  has  been  a  significant  difference
              between the income claimed  in  a  previous  application  for
              leave  to  remain  and  the  income  declared  to  HMRC,  the
              Secretary of State is entitled to draw an inference that  the
              Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest  and  therefore  he
              should  be  refused  ILR  within  paragraph  322(5)  of   the
              Immigration Rules. I would expect the Secretary of  State  to
              draw that inference where there is no  plausible  explanation
              for the discrepancy.


        (ii)         However, where an Applicant has presented evidence to
              show that, despite the prima facie inference, he was  not  in
              fact dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State
              is presented  with  a  fact-finding  task:  she  must  decide
              whether the explanation and evidence is  sufficient,  in  her
              view,   to   displace   the   prima   facie   inference    of
              deceit/dishonesty.


        (iii)       In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary of
              State should remind herself that, although  the  standard  of
              proof is the "balance  of  probability",  a  finding  that  a
              person has been deceitful and dishonest in  relation  to  his
              tax affairs with the consequence that he is denied settlement
              in this country  is  a  very  serious  finding  with  serious
              consequences.


        (iv)       However, for an applicant simply to blame  his  or  her
              accountant for an "error" in relation to the  historical  tax
              return will not be the end of the matter: far from it.  Thus,
              the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account that,
              even where an accountant has made an  error,  the  accountant
              will or should have asked the tax payer to confirm  that  the
              return was accurate and to have signed the  tax  return,  and
              furthermore the Applicant will  have  known  of  his  or  her
              earnings and will have  expected  to  pay  tax  thereon.  If,
              realising  this  (or  wilfully  shutting  his  eyes  to   the
              situation), the  Applicant  has  not  taken  steps  within  a
              reasonable time to remedy the  situation,  the  Secretary  of
              State may be entitled to conclude either that the  error  was
              not simply the fault of the accountant or, alternatively, the
              Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself  justifies
              a conclusion that he has been has been deceitful or dishonest
              and therefore he  should  be  refused  ILR  within  paragraph
              322(5) of the Immigration Rules.


        (v)          Where an issue arises  as  to  whether  an  error  in
              relation to  a  tax  return  has  been  dishonest  or  merely
              careless, the Secretary of State is obliged to  consider  the
              evidence pointing in each direction  and,  in  her  decision,
              justify her conclusion by  reference  to  that  evidence.  In
              those circumstances, as long as the reasoning is rational and
              the evidence has been properly considered,  the  decision  of
              the Secretary of State cannot be impugned.


        (vi)       There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of
              State to consider in reaching her decision  in  these  cases,
              including (but these are by no means exclusive):


                                                              i.       Wheth
                 er the explanation for  the  error  by  the  accountant  is
                 plausible;


                                                           ii.       Whether
                  the documentation which  can  be  assumed  to  exist  (for
                 example,  correspondence  between  the  Applicant  and  his
                 accountant  at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                 disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for why it is
                 missing;


                                                         iii.       Why the
                 Applicant did not realise  that  an  error  had  been  made
                 because his liability to pay tax was less  than  he  should
                 have expected;


                                                         iv.       Whether,
                 at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to  remedy  the
                 situation and, if so, when those steps were taken  and  the
                 explanation for any significant delay.


        (vii)     In relation to any of the above matters, the Secretary of
              State is likely to want to see  evidence  which  goes  beyond
              mere assertion: for example, in a case such  as  the  present
              where the explanation is that the Applicant was distracted by
              his concern for his son's health, there should be documentary
              evidence about the matter. If there is, then the Secretary of
              State would need to weigh up whether such  concern  genuinely
              excuses or explains the failure to account  for  tax,  or  at
              least displaces the inference that  the  Applicant  has  been
              deceitful/dishonest. The Secretary of  State,  before  making
              her  decision,  should  call  for  the  evidence  which   she
              considers ought  to  exist,  and  may  draw  an  unfavourable
              inference from any failure on the part of  the  Applicant  to
              produce it.


        (viii) In her decision, the Secretary of State  should  articulate
              her reasoning, setting out the matters which  she  has  taken
              into account in reaching her decision and stating the reasons
              for the decision she has reached."


7.   The respondent repaid the under paid tax as soon as his  attention  was
    brought to the matter and the judge was entitled to conclude as she did
    at paragraphs 41, 43, 45, 46, 48, 49.  She  accepted  the  respondent's
    innocent explanation and  on  that  basis  to  allow  the  respondent's
    appeal.  I find there to be no  errors  of  law  and  the  decision  is
    upheld.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of any fee which has been paid or may be payable (adjusted where full  award
not justified) for the following reason.  The appeal was allowed.
