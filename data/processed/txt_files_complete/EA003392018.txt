Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Frantzis, instructed by Freeths LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Canada. He appeals against a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on  12  July  2018  dismissing  his
    appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State  dated  7  December
    2017 refusing his application for a residence card as the family member
    of Doreen May Smith, a British citizen.

 2. Mr Diwnycz, who appeared for the Secretary of State, told me  that,  in
    light of  the  decision  in  Banger  [2018]  EUECJ  C-89/17,  that  the
    respondent now accepted that the judge had erred  in  law.  He  further
    acknowledged that the  decision  should  now  be  remade  allowing  the
    appeal.

Notice of Decision

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 12 July 2018  is
    set aside. I have remade the decision. The appellant's  appeal  against
    the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  dated  7  December  2017  is
    allowed.
