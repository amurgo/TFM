          DECISION AND REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

Introduction

    1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer. To avoid  confusion
       I refer to the Entry Clearance Officer as  "the  respondent"  and  Mr
       Singh as "the appellant", their designations  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.

    2. Mr Singh is a citizen of India and his date of birth is  4  September
       1988. He applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom as the  spouse
       of a British citizen. He is married  to  the  sponsor  Harinder  Kaur
       Samra (married on  23  August  2013  in  India).  Subsequent  to  the
       application for leave to enter their daughter Jasmeet was born on  10
       May 2014 in the UK. She is a British citizen.   The  Entry  Clearance
       Officer refused the application on 28 January 2014 on the basis  that
       the appellant had not provided the  information  requested  regarding
       the sponsor's salary, that the appellant did not meet  the  financial
       requirements and that he was not satisfied that the appellant was  in
       a genuine, subsisting relationship. The  appellant  appealed  against
       that decision to the First-tier Tribunal.

    3. At the hearing I heard submissions from Ms Pal on behalf of the Entry
       Clearance Officer and Ms Solanky on behalf of Mr Singh.

The First-tier Tribunal Judge's Decision

    4. The First-tier Tribunal,  Judge  Lucas  ('the  judge'),  allowed  the
       appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision. By the time of
       the  hearing  the  Entry  Clearance   Officer   accepted   that   the
       relationship requirements of the rules was met.  The  judge  recorded
       that the issues were whether the financial requirements were met  and
       whether it is proportionate for the sponsor to relocate to  India  to
       join the Appellant. The judge allowed the  appeal  finding  that  the
       appellant fulfilled the financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration
       Rules. The judge also found that the refusal of entry  clearance  was
       disproportionate and would have allowed the appeal under Article 8 of
       the ECHR.

Permission to Appeal

    5. The Entry Clearance Officer applied to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
       permission to appeal the decision. Permission to appeal  was  granted
       by First-tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta.

Legal Framework

    6. The relevant Rules on specified evidence are set out in Appendix  FM-
       SE of the Immigration Rules - Paragraph E-ECP.3.1

           'Financial requirements

           The applicant must provide specified evidence, from the  sources
           listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-

           (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-

                (i) �18,600;

                (ii) an additional �3,800 for the first child; and

                (iii) an additional �2,400 for each additional child;  alone
                or in combination with

           (b) specified savings of-

                (i) �16,000; and

                (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to 2.5 times
                the amount which is the difference between the gross  annual
                income from the sources listed in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.2.(a)-
                (d)  and  the  total  amount  required  under  paragraph  E-
                ECP.3.1.(a); or...'

    7. As a result of the amendments which came into force on 28 July  2014,
       inserted by section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014, the  Nationality,
       Asylum and Immigration Act 2002 ('the 2002  Act')  now  requires  the
       Tribunal to  take  certain  factors  into  account  when  determining
       whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts  breaches  respect
       for private and family life. The decision in the instant  case  is  a
       decision made under the Immigration  Acts.  The  relevant  provisions
       provide:

           117A Application of this Part

           (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

                (a) breaches a person's right to  respect  for  private  and
                family life under Article 8, and

                (b) as a result would be unlawful under  section  6  of  the
                Human Rights Act 1998.

           (2) In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

                (a) in all cases, to the considerations  listed  in  section
                117B, and

           (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2).

           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases

           (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the
           public interest.

           ...

           (3) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-

                (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                (b) are better able to integrate into society.

           (4) Little weight should be given to-

                (a) a private life, or

                (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner

           that is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.

           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established
           by a person at a time when the person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.

           (6) In the case of a person who is not  liable  to  deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

                (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                relationship with a qualifying child, and

                (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to  leave
                the United Kingdom.

    8. Article 8 of the ECHR states:

           (i)    Everyone has the right to respect  for  his  private  and
           family life, his home and his correspondence.

           (ii)   There shall be no interference by a public authority with
           the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance  with
           the law  and  is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
           interests of national security, public safety  or  the  economic
           well-being of the country, for the  prevention  of  disorder  or
           crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
           protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Error of Law

    9. The jurisdiction of this tribunal on an appeal  from  the  First-tier
       Tribunal is limited to points of law (s 11 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
       and Enforcement Act 2007). Generally  the  Upper  Tribunal  will  not
       interfere with the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, if  an  error
       of law is found, unless that decision is material to the  outcome  of
       the appeal.

   10. Two discrete grounds of appeal have been raised namely,  the  correct
       application of the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended)  ('the
       Immigration Rules') and the approach and findings  of  the  judge  on
       Article 8.

The correct interpretation of the Immigration Rules

   11. Ms Pal submitted that the judge had erred  in  the  approach  to  the
       financial  requirements  in  the  Immigration  Rules.  Although   not
       specified in the grounds of appeal, Ms Pal submitted that  the  judge
       erred by applying a simple  addition  of  gross  annual  income  plus
       savings. The correct approach is to calculate the  shortfall  in  the
       income then to calculate the savings required which will  be  �16,000
       plus 2.5 x the shortfall amount, not merely 2.5 x the  shortfall.  Ms
       Solanky submitted that  this  approach  was  incorrect.  The  �16,000
       requirement in the rules only applies where there is no  income.  She
       submitted that the Secretary of State did not understand  the  rules.
       The multiplication factor applies to the shortfall  because  that  is
       the shortfall that is needed for the period of the visa, namely  2  �
       years. The  savings  compensate  for  the  shortfall.  This  was  the
       sensible approach. Ms Solanky went through the  relevant  rules.  All
       the appellant needed to show was that �18,600 was available  for  2/5
       years. There is no requirement to have  an  additional  �16,000.  She
       submitted that the �16,000 only came into play if there was no income
       and people were relying solely on savings.

   12. Neither representative was able to refer  to  any  authority  on  the
       point.

   13. I have considered the case of MM, R (On the  Application  Of)  v  The
       Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC   1900
       (Admin)[1]. This  case  concerns  the  lawfulness  of  the  financial
       requirements in the Rules - the same requirements that are  in  issue
       in the instant case. It is not authority on the point as  the  method
       for calculating the required amount under the rules was not in issue.
       However, it sets out the how the calculation is carried out under the
       rules - at paragraph  107:

           ' ...

           iii. The alternative mode  of  proof  by  savings  requires  the
           sponsor to meet the income shortfall by savings over �16,000 x 2
           � years. Thus MM states he has a shortfall in income  of  �3,000
           per annum. He would need to supplement that income by savings of
           �16,000 plus �3,000 x 2 � = �23,500 to be able  to  sponsor  his
           wife's admission.'

   14. This supports the respondent's analysis. I have also  considered  the
       House of Commons Library updates briefing on the  financial  (minimum
       income) requirement for partner visas 20 July 2015. At 2.3:

           ' ...

           ... If cash savings are being relied on to satisfy  the  minimum
           income requirement, they must have been held by  the  applicant,
           their partner or both jointly and under their control,  and  for
           at least the six months prior to the date  of  application.  The
           first �16,000 in cash savings are not taken into  account.  This
           is because �16,000 is the level  at  which  a  person  generally
           ceases to be eligible for income-related benefits.

           When applying for temporary leave to remain, the amount of  cash
           savings that can be counted towards the  income  requirement  is
           calculated by dividing the amount of savings over �16,000 by 2.5
           (this is equivalent to the number of years  of  temporary  leave
           being applied for). When applying for Indefinite Leave to Remain
           (after five  years),  all  cash  savings  over  �16,000  can  be
           considered.

           In practice, therefore, when applying for temporary leave  as  a
           partner:

           . �62,500 in cash savings is required if no other income sources
           are being used to meet the income requirement: (62,500-16,000) /
           2.5 = 18,600

           . �17,500 in cash savings is required if the sponsor's income is
           �18,000, in order to make up the �600 shortfall: (17,500-16,000)
           / 2.5 = 600.'

   15. Turning to the Immigration Rules it is clear that an applicant has  a
       number of ways he can meet the income requirement in  E-ECP.3.2.  The
       financial requirements can be met by meeting paragraph  (a)  alone  -
       i.e.  by  having  a  gross  annual   minimum   income   of   �18,600.
       Alternatively, if the �18,600 income cannot be met, a combination  of
       annual income and the requirements  set  out  in  (b)  which  are  i)
       specified savings of �16000 and ii) additional savings equivalent  to
       2.5 times the shortfall (my emphasis). E-ECP.3.1 (b) (i) and (ii) are
       cumulative. Both must be satisfied if an applicant wishes to rely  on
       income in combination with  savings.  The  third  alternative  is  no
       income but meeting both sub-paragraphs i) and ii) of (b). The use  of
       'additional' puts the matter beyond doubt in my  view.  The  briefing
       note explains that the �16,000 savings are  not  taken  into  account
       because �16,000 is the level at which a person generally ceases to be
       eligible for income-related benefits.

   16. I am satisfied that the judge made an error of law  by  an  incorrect
       application of the financial requirements in  the  Rules.  The  judge
       (para 21) finds that there is ample evidence of finance in this case.
       The sponsor earns over  �17,000  and  has  savings  of  over  �4000'.
       Applying the correct requirements, in this case the sponsor's  income
       was �17,468.92, resulting in a shortfall of �1,131.08.  In  order  to
       qualify the appellant would require the sponsor to have �18,827.70 of
       savings calculated by multiplying �1,131.08  x  2.5  +  �16,000.  The
       sponsor, having savings only of �3,612.09, means the appellant cannot
       meet the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules.

Article 8

   17. As a result of my finding on the error of law in the judge's decision
       on the   Immigration Rules, I now need to  consider  the  grounds  of
       appeal on Article 8. The grounds of  appeal  assert  that  the  judge
       erred in allowing the appeal outside of the  Immigration  Rules.  The
       respondent argues that  the  Article  8  assessment  should  only  be
       carried out when there are compelling circumstances not recognised by
       the Rules (relying on the case of Gulshan (Article 8 -  new  Rules  -
       correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)). In this  case  the  judge
       did not identify  any  such  compelling  circumstances.  The  grounds
       assert that the correct test is that an appeal should only be allowed
       where there are exceptional circumstances - exceptional circumstances
       means that refusal would  lead  to  an  unjustifiably  harsh  outcome
       (Nagre [2013] EWCH HC 720).

   18. Ms Solanky set out in her skeleton argument detailed  arguments  with
       regard to the correct approach to Article 8. In essence she submitted
       (with  references  to  supporting  authorities)  that  there  is   no
       exceptionality test. There is nothing in the case law that suggests a
       threshold test  and  there  is  no  utility  in  imposing  a  further
       intermediary test as a preliminary to a consideration of an Article 8
       claim beyond the relevant criterion based rule, rather the nature  of
       the assessment and the reasoning which are called for are informed by
       threshold  conditions.   Ms  Solanky  argued  that   the   respondent
       incorrectly argues for a threshold test relying on Gulshan and  Nagre
       and that this is incorrect - she relied on the case  of  Sunassee,  R
       (on the application of) v  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
       Chamber) & Anor [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin)  ('Sunassee')  at  paragraph
       47. Ms Solanky submitted that the judge was correct to  consider  the
       claim under Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules. She  set  out
       various findings and evidence that the judge had identified referring
       to a number of paragraphs in the decision.

   19. In considering  the  grounds  of  appeal  I  am  satisfied  that  the
       respondent was not asserting that there is a threshold test to be met
       nor that a test of exceptionality must be applied. The core complaint
       is that the judge did not identify any compelling  circumstances  not
       recognised by the Rules. In Sunassee the High Court held:

         33.     The decision of Sales J in Nagre therefore,  as  explained,
         received the endorsement of the Court of Appeal and represents  the
         law. It has not been "overruled". It had  received  an  endorsement
         already in MM (Lebanon). The law is that there is always  a  second
         stage, but where all  relevant  considerations  have  been  weighed
         under the Rules and  there  are  no  compelling  circumstances  not
         sufficiently recognised under the Rules it will be enough  for  the
         decision maker simply to say that. This does not amount to a fetter
         on the approach of the FTT conducting  the  kind  of  appeal  which
         existed at the time of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  in
         this case. In this kind of  case,  the  issue  for  the  First-tier
         Tribunal is, or was [2], always the lawfulness of  the  refusal  to
         vary the claimant's leave to remain under section  6  of  the  1998
         Act.  The  duty  to  reach  a  conclusion  on  this  issue  is  not
         circumscribed by any procedural filter,  but  does  involve  giving
         proper weight to the public interest as expressed by  the  SSHD  in
         lawfully made rules and guidance (and now  applying  also  sections
         117A-D of the 2002 Act). The failure to  qualify  under  the  Rules
         will be tend to suggest that the public interest  requires  refusal
         of leave to vary, unless some countervailing  factors  are  present
         which are not already taken into account under the Rules  (emphasis
         added).

   20. Turning to the  judge's  decision  the  judge  has  not  specifically
       addressed  the  need  to  identify   compelling   circumstances   not
       sufficiently recognised under the Rules  in  order  to  consider  the
       claim under Article 8. That is not to say that mere  failure  to  set
       out the correct approach is an error if the substance of the decision
       demonstrates that the correct approach  has  been  adopted.  In  this
       cases the judge has identified a number of factors which  clearly  do
       not  feature  in  the  requirements  under  the  Rules.  The  factors
       identified by the judge are; the child, issues  with  regard  to  the
       sponsor's mental health and ability to care for her child on her own,
       the concerns over the child's health in  India,  the  fact  that  the
       sponsor no longer possesses an Indian passport  and  that  she  could
       only obtain a visa for  a  month  for  the  child  (para  24).  I  am
       satisfied that the judge did identify circumstances not  sufficiently
       recognised under  the  immigration  Rules.  However,  in  considering
       Article 8 the judge has not  set  out  in  the  decision  a  reasoned
       approach as to the basis on  which  she  has  considered  the  claim,
       insufficient reasons are given for the findings  and  the  judge  has
       failed to consider section 117 of the 2002 Act which is  a  mandatory
       requirement. The reasoning on the decision on Article 8 is  contained
       within one paragraph (24).  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  judge
       undertook a balancing exercise weighing the public interest  in  this
       case or why the refusal would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.
       The judge states that, 'The purpose of Article 8 is  not  to  prevent
       families from being reunited. There are in effect, no justifiable  or
       reasonable grounds to refuse entry clearance in this case.  In  terms
       of weighing the public interest the judge merely says  'There  is  no
       identifiable public interest in refusal in this case.'  I  find  that
       there was a material error of law - the decision is set  aside.  Both
       parties agreed that if I decided that there was a material  error  of
       law I could re-make the decision on the basis of the evidence  before
       me.

Decision

   21. The correct approach to determining a claim under Article 8  is  that
       set out in R v SSHD ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. A Tribunal should
       consider 5 questions, namely:

           (i) Will the proposed removal be an  interference  by  a  public
           authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to  respect
           for his private or (as the case may be) family life?

           (ii) If so, will such interference  have  consequences  of  such
           gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

           (iii) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

           (iv) If so, is  such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
           society in the interests of national security, public safety  or
           the economic wellbeing of the country,  for  the  prevention  of
           disorder or crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or
           for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

           (v) If so, is such interference proportionate to the  legitimate
           public end sought to be achieved?"

   22. In this case I do not consider it necessary to consider the  first  4
       questions posed as it is not disputed that a decision  that  keeps  a
       husband and father apart from his wife and child is  an  interference
       with family life, that the consequences in the circumstances of  this
       case are of such gravity to engage Article 8, that  the  interference
       is in accordance with the law and  is  necessary.  The  issue  to  be
       decided in this case is the proportionality of the interference.

   23. In Entry Clearance Officer, Dhaka v Box [2002] UKIAT  02212  at  para
       33 the court clarified that in entry clearance cases '...the relevant
       question the adjudicator should have considered was not  whether  the
       decision amounted to a disproportionate interference but whether  the
       immigration  authority...  failed  to  comply  with   the   "positive
       obligation"  on  him  to  facilitate  family  reunion.'   The   court
       considered that in interference and lack of  respect  cases,  similar
       principles applied. I adopt that approach.

   24. There is no 'exceptionality test' but there is a requirement to carry
       out  a  balancing  exercise  where  an  individual  cannot  meet  the
       requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  The  public  interest  will
       generally  only  be  outweighed  if  an  applicant  can   show   that
       'compelling circumstances' exist - see [40] to  [42]  of  SS  (Congo)
       [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

   25. The core issue is whether the interference in  the  appellant's,  the
       sponsor's and the child's Article 8 rights  is  proportionate.  There
       were issues  that  were  not  adequately  covered  by  the  Rules  as
       identified by the judge - the sponsor's mental health and ability  to
       care for her child on her own, the concerns over the  child's  health
       in India, the fact that the sponsor no  longer  possesses  an  Indian
       passport and that she could only obtain a visa for a  month  for  the
       child.

   26. I approach the proportionality exercise by  considering  firstly  and
       primarily the interests of the child in this case. In ZH (Tanzania) v
       SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 the Supreme Court noted that s 55 of the  Borders,
       Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 was enacted to  incorporate  the
       UK's obligation under article 3(1) United Nations Convention  on  the
       Rights of the  Child  that,  'In  all  actions  concerning  children,
       whether undertaken by public or private social welfare  institutions,
       courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies,  the
       best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.'

   27. The court held:

           "26. This did not mean (as it would do in other  contexts)  that
           identifying their best interests  would  lead  inexorably  to  a
           decision in conformity with those interests. Provided  that  the
           Tribunal did not treat any  other  consideration  as  inherently
           more significant than the best interests  of  the  children,  it
           could conclude that the strength  of  the  other  considerations
           outweighed them. The important thing, therefore, is to  consider
           those best interests first ...

           ...

           33. We now have a much greater understanding of  the  importance
           of these issues in  assessing  the  overall  well-being  of  the
           child. In making the proportionality assessment under article 8,
           the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration.
           This means that they must be  considered  first.  They  can,  of
           course,  be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect  of   other
           considerations. In this case, the countervailing  considerations
           were the need to maintain firm  and  fair  immigration  control,
           coupled with the mother's appalling immigration history and  the
           precariousness of her position when  family  life  was  created.
           But, as the Tribunal rightly pointed out, the children were  not
           to be blamed for that."

   28. In JO and Others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014]  UKUT  00517  (IAC)
       the Upper Tribunal  reviewed  the  relevant  principles  and  correct
       approach. The Tribunal set out at paragraph 9:

           "More detailed prescription of the correct approach  to  section
           55 and its interaction with Article 8  ECHR  has  followed.   In
           Zoumbas v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  1
           WLR 3690, the Supreme Court recently  considered  the  interplay
           between the best interests of the  child  and  Article  8  ECHR,
           rehearsing what might be termed a code  devised  by  Lord  Hodge
           comprising seven principles:

                (1)    The best interests of a child are an integral part of
                the proportionality assessment under Article 8 ECHR;

                (2)    In making that assessment, the best  interests  of  a
                child must be a primary consideration, although  not  always
                the  only  primary  consideration;  and  the  child's   best
                interests do not  of  themselves  have  the  status  of  the
                paramount consideration;

                (3)    Although  the  best  interests  of  a  child  can  be
                outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations,
                no other consideration can be  treated  as  inherently  more
                significant;

                (4)    While different judges might approach the question of
                the best interests of a  child  in  different  ways,  it  is
                important to ask oneself the right questions in  an  orderly
                manner in order to avoid the risk that the best interests of
                a  child  might  be   undervalued   when   other   important
                considerations were in play;

                (5)    It is important to have a clear  idea  of  a  child's
                circumstances and of what is in  a  child's  best  interests
                before  one  asks  oneself  whether  those   interests   are
                outweighed by the force of other considerations;

                (6)    To that end there is  no  substitute  for  a  careful
                examination of all relevant factors when the interests of  a
                child are involved in an Article 8 assessment; and

                (7)    A child must not be blamed for matters for  which  he
                or she is not responsible, such as the conduct of a parent."

   29. I have considered the factors identified in ZH (Tanzania) and JO  and
       Others set out above. The judge identified that the best interests of
       the child are served by having both parents involved in her life.  On
       the facts of this case that cannot be disputed  particularly  as  the
       sponsor is having difficulty in coping with caring for the child  and
       is suffering from depression. The sponsor's  evidence  in  connection
       with the child's health was 'my baby was seriously ill with  coughing
       due to polluted  environment  (in  India),  my  baby's  life  may  be
       permanently threatened  to  non-adjustable  environment  for  her  in
       India'. There was no medical evidence that  the  child's  health  had
       suffered during the visit to India, for example, evidence of visit to
       a doctor or a hospital in India and whether the causative effect  was
       the polluted environment. There was  no  medical  evidence  that  the
       child's health would be  impaired  if  moved  to  India,  or  of  any
       particular underlying condition that the child has  that  would  give
       rise to the child being unable to  adjust  to  living  conditions  in
       India.  In the absence of medical evidence I place little  weight  on
       this. This is a very young child (now aged  15  months).  No  private
       life can be said to have built up in the United Kingdom. Being  cared
       for by both parents can be facilitated if the sponsor chose  to  move
       to India to live with her husband (although there  were  difficulties
       in obtaining a visa for more than a month for the child  it  has  not
       been suggested that this could not be resolved if the sponsor were to
       live in India permanently). This would  also  resolve  the  sponsor's
       problems coping alone with the care of the child.  I  find  that  the
       best interests of the child is to be cared for by  both  parents  but
       that this does not require that the child lives in the UK.

   30. The sponsor  has  mental  health  problems.  She  says  that  she  is
       suffering from depression and has  suicidal  tendencies.  No  medical
       evidence was put before the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  in  a  bundle
       submitted to the Upper Tribunal it is clear that the sponsor has  now
       visited her doctor (on 4 June 2015) who indicates that the  appellant
       is suffering from mild anxiety and  depression  (suicidal  tendencies
       was not recorded) and that medication has been prescribed.  This  was
       recorded by the GP as a 'new episode'. In an accompanying  letter  to
       the Upper Tribunal it is explained that the sponsor did not go to the
       GP before as she was concerned that her child  might  be  removed.  I
       accept that the sponsor may have been reluctant to visit her  GP  and
       that the depression may have been in existence before  the  visit  to
       the GP. If the sponsor were to re-locate  to  India  presumably  this
       would also facilitate an improvement in her  mental  health  problems
       (we are told that the depression has largely been contributed  to  by
       being separated from her husband).  Even if medical intervention were
       required to be continued in India, it has  not  been  suggested  that
       there are not adequate facilities to treat the medical  condition  in
       India. The sponsor speaks Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu. The sponsor speaks
       Punjabi when communicating with the appellant. I do not  foresee  any
       language difficulties or any particular difficulties with the sponsor
       integrating into the culture in India.  The  sponsor  has  family  in
       India - her parents live there and she would be joining her  husband.
       The appellant in interview  when  asked  what  he  would  do  if  his
       application failed answered that 'she will come and live with me here
       in India, I can look after her'.

   31.  Having  considered  all  the  factors  I  do  not  accept  that  the
       difficulties identified are  such  that  they  amount  to  more  than
       matters of mere hardship or mere difficulty for the sponsor  and  her
       daughter to re-locate to India if they chose to do so  to  live  with
       the appellant.  I have considered the submissions made by Ms  Solanky
       that it would not be reasonable to expect the child, who is a British
       citizen, to relocate to India. I accept that the child's  nationality
       is of particular importance and  must  be  given  proper  recognition
       because British children 'have rights which they will not be able  to
       exercise if  they  move  to  another  country.  They  will  lose  the
       advantages of growing up and being educated  in  their  own  country,
       their own culture and their own language', ZH (Tanzania) para 32.  In
       this case no-one is requiring the child or the sponsor to  re-locate.
       In Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano  -  Dereci)  [2012]
       UKUT 00048 (IAC) in the headnote the position was summarised as:

           "6. Where in the context of Article 8 one parent ("the remaining
           parent") of a British citizen child is also  a  British  citizen
           (or cannot be removed as a family member or in their own right),
           the removal of the other parent does not mean  that  either  the
           child or the remaining parent will be required to leave, thereby
           infringing the Zambrano principle, see  C-256/11  Murat  Dereci.
           The critical question is whether the child is dependent  on  the
           parent being removed for the exercise  of  his  Union  right  of
           residence and whether removal of that parent  will  deprive  the
           child of the effective  exercise  of  residence  in  the  United
           Kingdom or elsewhere in the Union."

   32. By analogy the appellant is being refused entry but refusal of  entry
       will not deprive the child in this case of effective residence in the
       United Kingdom unless the sponsor chooses to re-locate to India.

   33. I have considered section 117 of the 2002 Act.  Although  the  public
       interest is statutorily enshrined in s117B these factors are not  the
       only  factors  to  be  considered  but  they  form  a   bedrock   for
       consideration. Sufficient weight  must  be  accorded  to  the  public
       interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration  controls.
       Further, sufficient weight must be accorded to the interests  of  the
       economic well-being of the United Kingdom, in that persons  who  seek
       to enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  must  be  financially
       independent.  The  appellant  was  unable  to  meet   the   financial
       requirements of the Immigration Rules.

   34. The sponsor and the appellant entered  into  their  relationship  and
       marriage at a time when they knew that the sponsor had no entitlement
       to enter and remain in the UK. In R (on the application of Mahmood) v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] INLR the court held
       "The state has a right under international law to control  the  entry
       of non-nationals into its territory  subject  always  to  its  treaty
       obligations.  Article 8 does not impose  on  the  state  any  general
       obligation to respect the choice of residence of a married couple".

   35. The couple conceived their child in those circumstances. It cannot be
       held against the child, in assessing her interests,  as  she  had  no
       knowledge of her father's immigration status. In MH (Pakistan) [2011]
       CSOH 143 it was held that the respondent's entitlement to  take  into
       account the precariousness of the position when  a  relationship  was
       entered into and  the  need  to  maintain  immigration  control  were
       confirmed in ZH (Tanzania).

   36. Having weighed all the factors set out above the cumulative effect of
       the factors in favour of refusal of entry, the precariousness of  the
       appellant's position with  regard  to  entry  clearance,  the  public
       interest in maintenance of  effective  immigration  control  and  the
       public interest in ensuring that persons who seek to enter or  remain
       in the United  Kingdom  are  financially  independent,  outweigh  the
       interests of the child,  sponsor  and  appellant.  I  find  that  the
       interference with their Article 8  rights  is  proportionate  to  the
       legitimate aim of preserving the economic well-being of the  country.
       The refusal to grant the appellant entry clearance as  a  partner  is
       proportionate.

   37. I note (although this does not form part of my decision and  was  not
       taken into account in reaching my decision) that it is  open  to  the
       appellant to make a further application if the sponsor now meets  the
       financial requirements.

  Conclusions

   38. There was a material error of law such that the decision of the First-
       tier Tribunal is set aside.

   39. I decided to re-make the decision. I dismiss the  appellant's  appeal
       against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  to  refuse  to  grant
       entry clearance as a partner  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  to
       refuse the claim under article 8.

   40. I have considered whether any parties require the  protection  of  an
       anonymity direction. No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously.
       Having considered all  the  circumstances  and  evidence  we  do  not
       consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

  Notice of Decision

  The appeal is allowed. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set
  aside.

  I re-make the decision.

  The appellant's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  to
  refuse  the  appellant's  application  for  leave  to  enter  under   the
  Immigration Rules and claim under Article 8 is dismissed.
