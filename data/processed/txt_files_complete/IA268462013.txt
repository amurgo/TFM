                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 10th  April  1984.   She
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge Morris) who in a determination promulgated on  23rd  April  2014
    dismissed her appeal against the decision of the Respondent  to  refuse
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant under paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration  Rules  HC  395  as
    amended.

 2. The case was listed for oral hearing in accordance with the  directions
    given by the Upper Tribunal following the grant of  permission  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Landes) on 21st  May  2014.   There  was  no
    appearance or representation on behalf of the Appellant at the  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal.  On the case file it demonstrates  that  the
    Appellant was served with notice of hearing on 29th  May  2014  to  the
    address given as her home address.  Notice of hearing was  also  served
    upon her legal representatives Rahman & Company Solicitors on the  same
    day.  Whilst directions were sent to the Appellant  and  to  her  legal
    representatives with the grant of permission, no further  documentation
    had been provided in accordance with those  directions.   On  the  file
    there is a letter dated  23rd  June  2014  from  Rahman  &  Co  stating
    "Further to the above matter we do not have any instructions  from  the
    client to attend the hearing on her behalf of 2nd July 2014."  Thus the
    letter demonstrates that her legal representatives were  aware  of  the
    hearing and were not instructed to attend on her behalf  and  the  case
    file also demonstrates that she was served with notice of  the  hearing
    on 2nd July.  She did not attend and in those circumstances, and in the
    light of the documentation that I have just set out  in  the  preceding
    paragraph, I am satisfied that the Appellant did  have  notice  of  the
    hearing and thus the appeal should proceed in her absence.

 3. The history can be briefly stated.  The Appellant arrived on  24th  May
    2011 in possession of a visa conferring leave to  enter  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant until 2nd September  2012.   On  31st  August
    2012 she made an application for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  4
    (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based   system.    That
    application was refused on 10th January 2013  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(d) and  in
    relation to Appendix C.  The Appellant's case was that she had enrolled
    for an Extended Diploma in Management at West City College.  It appears
    that the  Respondent  withdrew  the  decision  before  the  Appellant's
    hearing was to take place on 31st May 2013.

 4. On 13th June 2013 the Respondent issued a fresh decision to refuse  the
    application on the same grounds.  The reasons given can  be  stated  as
    follows.  It was refused because it  was  asserted  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent that the documents of the Appellant did not include all  the
    mandatory information required under the Rules.  Therefore she did  not
    meet the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(d) with reference to  Appendix
    C of the Rules.  The reasons given were as follows:-

      i) She was required to prove she had the required maintenance fees  of
         �1600 together with outstanding course fees.  She was  required  to
         show that she was in possession of �2,600 for a consecutive 28  day
         period.

     ii) The deficiencies in the documents were also set out namely that

          a) the HBL bank statement she produces in  the  name  of  Tanveer
             Bagham,  and  no  documents  relating   to   the   Appellant's
             maintenance had been provided in her own name;

          b) no birth certificate or Sponsor's  letter  had  been  provided
             with her previous application which had been refused  on  10th
             January 2013.  A bank statement in the name of Tanveer  Bagham
             was provided but there was no explanation as to who the person
             was;

          c) there was nothing to explain the Appellant's relationship  (if
             any) with Tanveer Bagham, nor was there  a  letter  from  that
             person confirming her willingness to sponsor the Appellant;

          d) neither a birth certificate nor a Sponsor's  letter  had  been
             provided with the Appellant's current  application  and  there
             was no reference to either of these documents.

          e) The fact that the Appellant had provided the Sponsor's  letter
             and a birth certificate at the appeal stage did  not  have  an
             effect on the prior refusal decision.

 5. The Appellant sought to appeal that decision  and  general  Grounds  of
    Appeal were issued which stated that the decision was  unlawful  as  it
    was incompatible with her rights under the European Convention (Article
    8), it was  stated  that  she  was  a  genuine  student  and  that  the
    Respondent had failed to follow her policy of  "evidential  flexibility
    policy".  It was also asserted that the decision was not in  accordance
    with the law (the decision to remove under Section 47).

 6. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Morris) who in  a
    determination promulgated on 23rd April 2014 dismissed her appeal under
    the Immigration Rules and also on Article 8 grounds.

 7. The reasons given  by  the  judge  to  dismiss  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules was that for the reasons given at paragraph  14(i)(a)
    - (e) and (ii)(a) and (b) and (iii) and (iv) were  that  the  Appellant
    had not demonstrated that she had shown on the balance  of  probability
    that all the documents contain undated  information  and  in  the  form
    specified under Appendix C were provided.  The judge gave a  number  of
    reasons for reaching this conclusion by consideration of the  documents
    that had been produced with the application, by  consideration  of  the
    application form and the  evidence  that  had  been  given  before  the
    Tribunal.   It  appears  that  the  judge  did  accept  that  a   birth
    certificate and a declaration  were  subsequently  provided  after  the
    application but in her view the argument based on the  case  of  Khatel
    and Others (Section 85A; effect of continuing application) [2013]  UKUT
    00044, that as the date of the application met the date upon which  the
    application was made and that it was not  a  continuous  period  ending
    with the date of decision, any information that had been provided could
    not be taken into account.  However at 14(iii) the  judge  reached  the
    conclusion that even at the date of the hearing, the Appellant had  not
    satisfied the requirements of Appendix C stating "the birth certificate
    produced is said to have been taken from the birth register in Pakistan
    but, given that it was not the one originally issued, it is a copy  and
    according to the  requirements  of  Appendix  C  it  should  have  been
    notarised it was not."  Thus she dismissed the appeal.  The judge  also
    gave consideration to  her  claim  under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR  at
    paragraphs 16 to 23.  There are no  grounds  challenging  the  decision
    made on human rights grounds.

 8. An application to appeal that decision was made and on  21st  May  2014
    permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes.

 9. Thus the application was listed before the Upper Tribunal.  As  I  have
    set out in the early paragraphs, the Appellant,  although  served  with
    notice of the hearing as were her legal representatives, there  was  no
    appearance no attendance and no further documentation has  been  either
    filed or served upon the Tribunal or the Respondent in accordance  with
    the directions that were provided with the  grant  of  permission.   No
    further information of any kind has been produced.

10.   Mr Tarlow relied upon the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the
    findings that were made in relation to the application.  In relation to
    the grant of permission, it was  noted  at  paragraph  2  that  it  was
    arguable that the judge misdirected herself as to  the  affect  of  the
    Khatel argument (see Nasim 2013] UKUT 610).  The  conclusion  was  that
    Section 85A did not prevent the Tribunal from considering evidence that
    was before the Respondent when a decision was made even if the evidence
    had not been before the Respondent at the date of the  application  for
    the purposes of paragraph 34F.  In this respect, it was submitted  that
    even if the judge was in error in her assessment  of  the  decision  of
    Khatel, the notarised  birth  certificate  was  still  not  before  the
    Respondent and was not even before the First-tier Tribunal at the  date
    of the hearing and thus she could not meet the Rules.

11. I made some enquiries of Mr Tarlow considering the case file concerning
    the issue of documentation and  in  particular  why  the  decision  was
    withdrawn on 30th May 2013.  In this context it  is  right  to  observe
    that nowhere in the documentation, either  put  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  or  the  Upper  Tribunal  does  the  Appellant  provide   any
    information as to why the decision was withdrawn and  what  information
    she provided subsequently (if any) as a result of the withdrawal of the
    decision.  It is also right to observe  that  the  Respondent  did  not
    provide any information either and the determination of the  First-tier
    Tribunal, understandably, also makes no reference to it because it does
    not appear that any of the parties referred to it.    At  its  highest,
    the only information was that it was refused on the same grounds as  it
    was in January 2013.  In those circumstances I asked Mr Tarlow to  look
    at the file.  The case record that he had indicated that  the  decision
    was withdrawn as a result of the  evidential  flexibility  policy.   It
    appeared that she submitted the bank statement of Tanveer  Bagham  only
    with her application  and  there  was  no  evidence  that  she  was  an
    acceptable  financial  Sponsor  and  thus  applying  the  decision   of
    Rodriguez, the decision  was  required  to  give  full  effect  to  the
    evidential flexibility point.  It is not clear from  the  case  records
    what documentation they were going to require  from  the  Appellant  or
    what, if any, correspondence there was between the parties or what  the
    Appellant did in the light of the  withdrawal.   It  appears  that  the
    documentation that was before the Secretary of State at the time of the
    withdrawal of the decision included an affidavit from  her  mother  (or
    declaration) and a birth certificate.  However the  Appellant  has  not
    provided any evidence relating to  the  circumstances  surrounding  the
    withdrawal and there was no evidence either put before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  or  in  the  grounds  for  the  present  appeal  as  to  what
    documentation, if any, was sent after the withdrawal.   In  particular,
    it is not known what documentation was being sought or was subsequently
    sent by the Appellant.

12. I posed the question as to whether or not it  could  be  the  notarised
    birth certificate because the birth certificate as the judge noted  had
    not been in the correct form.   However  that  was  speculation  as  no
    evidence  could  be  ascertained  concerning  this  issue.   Mr  Tarlow
    submitted that in the circumstances as the  judge  noted  she  had  not
    provided all the mandatory documentation either  with  her  application
    for the reasons that she properly gave or before  the  Respondent  made
    the second decision and in those circumstances the Respondent  was  not
    under any obligation to ask for  any  further  documents  either  under
    paragraph 245AA or the evidential flexibility point.  He submitted that
    if the document had been available and  indeed  it  was  the  notarised
    birth certificate there was no explanation by the Appellant why it  had
    not been sent after the first decision  was  withdrawn.   He  submitted
    that she had had the opportunity to provide information and she had not
    attended court to progress her appeal in any way.

13. I reserved my determination.

14. The grounds as drafted submit that the  judge  misdirected  herself  in
    relation to the law and the facts.  Firstly the  finding  made  by  the
    judge that she had not produced all of her documentation at the time of
    the application is said not  to  be  supported  by  the  evidence  (see
    paragraph 5 of the grounds).  In this  respect  it  is  said  that  the
    application form referred to boxes being ticked at L22 and L23 and  the
    First-tier Tribunal failed to take this into account but had focused at
    the box beside "birth certificate" which had been blanked out.  As  the
    judge granting permission noted that was a very thin argument  but  the
    judge had explained carefully why she had not accepted the  Appellant's
    primary submission that all the documents had been submitted  with  the
    original application and this was not simply the fact that the relevant
    box on the application form had been tippexed out  but  also  that  the
    documents  on  the  envelope  on  file  matched  those  ticked  on  the
    application form and also that the Appellant had not mentioned  in  the
    Grounds of Appeal that it was her contention  that  all  documents  had
    been sent.

15. I respectfully agree with that view.  It is plain after looking at  the
    documentation as described by the First-tier Tribunal and  the  reasons
    given by Judge Morris for finding that the Appellant had  not  provided
    all the specified documents with the original application were  clearly
    set out at paragraphs 14(i)(a) - (e) and (ii), (iii) and  (iv).   Those
    findings were sustainable findings made on the evidence and the matters
    set out in paragraph 5 are  merely  a  disagreement  with  the  judge's
    proper assessment of the evidence that was  before  her.   The  reasons
    given was that the application form  completed  by  the  Appellant  was
    shown to her during the hearing and the section asked  her  to  confirm
    which documentation had been produced, she had ticked the boxes but the
    box relating to whether or not a birth certificate  had  been  included
    clearly showed she had originally ticked that box but then deleted  the
    tick using tippex.  Furthermore the envelope in which  the  Appellant's
    application and its accompanying documents were sent was  produced  and
    shown to the Appellant.  The document from the envelope were  the  same
    as those the Appellant had indicated by the means of the  tick  on  the
    application form.  They did not include any further documents  such  as
    the Appellant's birth certificate.  The judge was entitled to find that
    on the balance of probabilities no other documents had been  sent  with
    the Appellant's  application  and  that  was  because  the  correlation
    between the boxes the Appellant had ticked  and  the  presence  of  the
    documents referred to in those boxes made it more likely than  not  the
    documents contained in the original envelope were the  only  ones  that
    she sent.  It is also clear now from the  case  records  that  had  she
    provided all these specified  documentation  it  would  not  have  been
    necessary for the decision to have been withdrawn and further enquiries
    made, although of course it is not known what enquiries  were  made  or
    that the Appellant did in any event.  Thus there is no  merit  in  that
    ground.

16. As to the second ground  concerning  a  material  misdirection  in  law
    relating to the judge's view of Khatel, in this  respect  it  is  plain
    that the judge did not take into account  the  decision  of  Nasim  and
    Others [2013] UKUT 610 which noted that as held in  Khatel  and  Others
    Section 85A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    precludes the Tribunal,  in  a  points-based  appeal  from  considering
    evidence as to compliance with points-based Rules, where that  evidence
    was not before the Secretary of State when she took her  decision;  but
    the Section does not prevent a Tribunal from considering evidence  that
    was before the Secretary of State when she took the  decision,  whether
    or not that evidence reached her only after the date of the application
    for the purposes of paragraph 34F of the Immigration Rules.

17.   It appears to be the position that the First-tier  Tribunal  accepted
    that the birth certificate and the declaration had been  provided,  not
    with the application but with the appeal  grounds  before  the  hearing
    that was to take place in May 2013 and before  the  withdrawal  of  the
    decision.  Therefore the judge's conclusion that Khatel did  not  apply
    is not right in the context of the decision of Nasim as set out  above.
    However, the judge did not leave the matter there.   Even  if  it  were
    right that those documents had been provided before  the  decision  and
    therefore the Tribunal were not precluded from  considering  them,  the
    judge noted at (14(iii) that "even now, the Appellant does not  satisfy
    the requirements of Appendix C".  The  birth  certificate  produced  is
    said to have been taken from the births register in Pakistan but, given
    that it was not the one originally issued, it is a copy  and  according
    to the requirements of Appendix C, it should have been  notarised.   It
    was not.   Therefore as the determination makes plain, even at the date
    of the hearing (which was too late in any event)  the  Appellant  still
    did not meet the requirements of Appendix C.   In  those  circumstances
    any error in the application of Khatel could make no difference to  the
    outcome.

18.   It appears to be accepted that the notarised  birth  certificate  was
    not provided because the grounds go on to state at paragraph 6 that the
    failure to provide a notarised copy of the birth certificate  would  be
    something covered by the evidential  flexibility  policy  or  paragraph
    245A of the Immigration Rules.  The difficulty with  that  argument  is
    that it does not take into account the history of  the  appeal  that  I
    have set out earlier and that if  those  documents  had  been  provided
    along with the Grounds of Appeal against the decision of  January  2013
    and therefore before the Secretary of State, the original decision  was
    withdrawn and the Appellant appears to have been given the  opportunity
    by way application of the evidential flexibility policy to provide  all
    the specified documents required for consideration of her application.

19.   Whilst I have set out that it is not clear  what  documents,  if  any
    were requested nor is it clear from  any  evidence  provided  upon  the
    Appellant, who has the burden of proof in this appeal, as to  what  she
    did in relation to  the  withdrawal.   However,  I  conclude  from  the
    history and on the only documentation that has been placed  before  me,
    that having already been given an opportunity to rectify  any  problems
    with her documentation as the First-tier Tribunal Judge  noted  it  was
    still not rectified even at  the  time  of  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Morris.  In those circumstances, I do  not  consider  that  it  can  be
    properly argued that the Respondent had a duty yet  again  to  ask  the
    Appellant to provide any further documentation,  having  already  given
    her the opportunity to rectify any difficulties with the documentation.



20. The Appellant has not provided any further documentation, she  has  not
    appeared before the Tribunal to argue her case any further and I remind
    myself that the burden to  demonstrate  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge was in error lies on the Appellant.  For the reasons that I  have
    given, I do not find that there is any error of law that  was  material
    to the outcome of this appeal and therefore the decision shall stand.

21. The First-tier Tribunal Judge also dealt with the human  rights  issues
    under Article 8.  There  is  no  challenge  in  the  grounds  to  those
    findings.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve the  making  of  an
error of law to set aside the decision.   Thus  the  decision  stands.   The
appeal is dismissed.
