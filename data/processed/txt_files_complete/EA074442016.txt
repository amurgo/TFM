                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                     ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, SHEFFIELD
                                                                  Respondent


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
    (pursuant to rule 17 Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008)

 1. By a decision promulgated on  16  February  2017,  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge S T Fox dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's
    refusal dated 31 May 2016 refusing him entry clearance to accompany his
    son to the UK.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Alis on 6
    September 2017.  The appeal is listed for an error of  law  hearing  in
    Bradford on Thursday 30 November 2017 (i.e. tomorrow).

 3. By a letter dated 29 November 2017, the Appellant's solicitors wrote to
    the Tribunal indicating that  the  Appellant  wishes  to  withdraw  his
    appeal.

 4. Paragraph 17 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    provides that a party may withdraw its case before the  Upper  Tribunal
    only with the consent of the Tribunal. If the Tribunal does so  consent
    this would amount to a final disposal of the appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal. In this case, the effect of that withdrawal would be that the
    Appellant's appeal remains dismissed.

 5. Subject to consideration being  given  to  any  request  received  from
    either party to the contrary by 4pm today, the Upper Tribunal  proposes
    to consent to the Appellant withdrawing his case and the hearing on  30
    November will be vacated.
