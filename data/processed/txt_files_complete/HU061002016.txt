                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Kirsty Real), sitting at Newport on 2 May 2017, to   an
    ETS  appeal by a citizen of Nepal, born 1982. The judge found that  the
    Home Office evidence of his proxy-taking the relevant test, through the
    Premier Language Training Centre at Barking, on 21  August  2012,  gave
    him a case to answer on deception; but, for reasons she gave,  did  not
    establish it on the required balance of probabilities.  The  suggestion
    at paragraphs 1 - 7 of the grounds that the judge did  not  apply  this
    standard of proof is quite simply unarguable, in view  of  her  express
    reference to the authorities at paragraphs 18 - 19.

 2. Various complaints are raised in the  inordinately  prolix  grounds  of
    appeal, most of  which  are  unjustified:  we  shall  deal  with  these
    briefly, but concentrate on what  seems  to  us  the  real  issue.  The
    following relevant documents were before the judge, all from  the  Home
    Office, (b) and (c)  using  their  Look-up  Tool,  and  attached  to  a
    statement by Kelvin Hibbs:

     a) a report 'Project Faï¿½ade - criminal inquiry';
     b) an analysis of the results obtained with Premier  on  the  relevant
        day; and
     c) the appellant's own results: there is no explanation  for  the  two
        separate entries, but both are in the same terms.

 3. The judge dealt with (a) at 25. It is a Home Office report; but  signed
    by temporary Detective Inspector  Andrew  Carter  of  the  police  team
    responsible for it. There is nothing in MA (ETS - TOEIC  testing)[2016]
    UKUT 450 (IAC), to which Mr Kotas referred us,  to  give  any  specific
    approval to that report, and we see no error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    conclusion that it raised no prima facie  case  of  fraud  against  any
    individual. It did however contain a  relevant  analysis  of  Premier's
    results on TOEIC tests taken there between 2011 and 2014.

 4. At 26 the judge went on to deal with (b) 'annex AA', and (c) 'annex A'.
    So far as these documents were concerned, she accepted at 30 that ETS's
    conclusions, to the effect that the appellant's test had been taken  by
    proxy, and that the day's  results  with  Premier  showed  prima  facie
    evidence of corruption there, were  "...  sufficient  to  discharge  an
    initial evidential burden".

 5. This conclusion was very much in line with SM and Qadir (ETS - Evidence
    - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC), and all 'reported'  decisions
    on statutory appeals of this kind since then. It also answers the point
    made at paragraph 12 of the grounds, since what the judge went on to do
    was to assess the evidence on both sides, including the basic  'generic
    evidence' (statements by Rebecca Collings  and  Peter  Millington)  and
    conclude, at 47, that the Home Office had not established fraud by  the
    appellant. This was of course a question for her  on  the  facts;  and,
    provided she took the right approach to it, the decision  was  one  for
    her alone.

 6. Dealing first with the other bad points in the grounds:

     a) (paragraphs 8 -  10)  the  judge  gave  reasons  at  33  -  36  for
        concluding the appellant had no motive to cheat, on  the  basis  of
        what she found to be  his  English-language  skills  in  2012.  The
        relevance of this is challenged, on  the  basis  of  a  passage  at
        paragraph 57 of MA.

        However, the Tribunal there did no more  than  to  acknowledge  the
        possibility of other reasons than need to have a proxy  take  one's
        test. As they said, the issue had not been  explored  before  them,
        and they declined to speculate about it. Here  the  judge  reviewed
        the evidence on the  point  carefully,  making  proper  distinction
        between the appellant's English then and now. It  might  well  have
        been wrong, given the other possible reasons, to regard the lack of
        motive as conclusive in his favour; but she did no more  than  take
        it into account as a factor, and there is no reason why she  should
        not have done so, subject to what we say later  about  the  general
        evidence on Premier's results.


     b) (paragraph 11), also on this point, it is suggested that the  judge
        was  wrong  not  to  take  into  account  the  well-known  Panorama
        programme, showing students standing by their proxies as they  took
        their tests for them  (so  that  they  would  know  all  about  the
        questions and procedure, without having done  so  themselves).  The
        basis for this bold  assertion  is  that  the  programme  "...  was
        provided on DVD to every hearing centre".

        This shows  an  astonishing  ignorance  of  the  general  rules  of
        evidence and procedure. Judges are not expected to  deal  with  any
        evidence which has not been put in, or at  least  referred  to,  as
        part of a party's case, so that the other side  have  a  chance  to
        deal with it. Sometimes they will wish to take judicial  notice  of
        something which is common knowledge; but  they  will  always  bring
        that to the parties' attention, for the same reason.

 7. Coming to the real issue, the judge reached her  conclusion  about  the
    appellant having a case to answer on fraud despite finding at  29  that
    "... the record of ETS categorising a test  as  "invalid"  has  limited
    weight, because it is a hearsay  assertion  where  the  basis  for  the
    categorisation cannot  be  evaluated  in  this  Appellant's  individual
    case". She went on to give as an additional  reason  for  that  finding
    that Mr Hibbs had effectively invited her to evaluate  the  appellant's
    evidence for herself. However that  did  no  more  than  recognize  the
    approach laid down in SM and Qadir : see 5.

 8. That point is not material in itself, since the judge decided that  the
    appellant did have a case to answer; but it sheds  some  light  on  her
    approach to the question of whether on all the evidence the Home Office
    had established fraud on his part. This can be seen at 39:

       Since this appeal cannot entail an examination of the quality of  the
       evidence relied upon  by  ETS  in  forming  its  conclusions  in  the
       Appellant's individual case I am unable to attribute  more  than  the
       limited weight I identified above to the Respondent's evidence.

 9. At this stage we need to set out the relevant evidence in  the  various
    items at 2.

 a) is best shown in a table, together with (b):

|results      |total        |invalid      |questionable |no evidence  |
|             |             |             |             |of invalidity|
|Secure public|1039         |3 (0.28%)    |0            |1036 (99.72%)|
|ETS centres  |             |             |             |             |
|2011 -14     |             |             |             |             |
|Premier 2012 |5055         |3780 (75%)   |1275 (25%)   |0            |
|- 14         |             |             |             |             |
|Premier 21   |170          |117 (69%)    |53 (31%)     |0            |
|August 2012  |             |             |             |             |
|(b)          |             |             |             |             |





10. At (c) the appellant's own results are assessed as 'invalid'.  If  that
    assessment  had  stood  alone,  then  there  might   have   been   more
    justification for the judge's approach; but it did  not.  Simply  as  a
    matter of  common  sense,  she  needed  to  consider  the  discrepancy,
    surprising to say the least, between the secure  test  centre  results,
    very nearly all valid, and Premier's, 75% invalid and the remaining 25%
    no better than questionable. The pattern of results was  unquestionably
    relevant, as can be seen from the  reference  to  general  evidence  of
    corruption at particular centres at paragraph 44 of MA.

11. The Home Office's use of the Look-up Tool has been referred to in  many
    'reported' decisions,  and  upheld  on  the  basis  of  the  supporting
    evidence. We shall not go into this here, because, quite apart from the
    validity or otherwise of the judge's giving  'limited  weight'  to  the
    evidence of invalidity in the appellant's individual case, there is the
    need to look at that in terms of the general  discrepancy  between  the
    secure results and Premier's.

12. Mr Kotas realistically conceded that the judge's  decision  might  have
    been sustainable, on her reasoning, if the appellant's own results  had
    been assessed as questionable. As we have said, it might also have been
    open to the judge to decide as she did if they  had  stood  alone;  but
    neither of these was the case. While the judge  was  entitled  to  look
    into the  evidential  basis  for  the  assessment  in  the  appellant's
    individual case, she had to consider it, not only against her  view  of
    his evidence as a whole,  but  against  the  results  obtained  through
    Premier in general. Those would have been particularly relevant to  the
    conclusions she reached on accepting the appellant's evidence  that  he
    had indeed taken his test through Premier.

13. For those reasons we have reluctantly decided that the judge's decision
    cannot stand on her reasoning; reluctantly  because  in  our  view  she
    wrote it very clearly and with great care, and most of  the  criticisms
    made of it in the grounds were unfair or misconceived, for the  reasons
    we have given in dealing with paragraphs 1 - 11 of the grounds.

14. The judge allowed the appeal on the only ground now open to  her,  that
    the decision was contrary to the appellant's human  rights.  While  she
    approached that question by way of the requirements of  the  Rules,  as
    required  by  the  authorities,  her  conclusions,  both  on  the  long
    residence point at 43 - 44, and, at 44 - 45, in terms  of  the  general
    law,  including  the  requirements  of  s.  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, both relied on her  finding  that  the
    Home Office had not established fraud on the appellant's part.

15. That is the central question in  this  case,  which  will  have  to  be
    decided at a fresh hearing. Shortly after we heard this case, the  Home
    Office's 'position statement' on ETS cases (both 'new-style'  as  here,
    and 'old-style') was made available. This  was  made  in  two  judicial
    review cases pending before a presidential panel, and invited the Upper
    Tribunal

         "... to consider  staying  all  New-Style  ETS  Cases  pending  the
         judgment of the Court of Appeal in the linked cases of R  (Hossain)
         v SSHD (C6/2016/3560) and R (Islam) v  SSHD  (C8/2017/1385),  which
         are to be heard together in June 2018."


16. Since we had no opportunity to refer the parties to this, and so far as
    we know no view has been taken on it  by  the  panel  or  the  Tribunal
    generally, we shall say no more than that in our view there would be  a
    great deal to be said for the fresh hearing  in  this  case  to  follow
    without waiting for the Court of  Appeal's  decision  in  the  judicial
    review cases referred to. A  conclusion  can  be  reached  on  all  the
    evidence as to whether the Home Office have established fraud  on  this
    appellant's part, and his human rights considered in the light of that.
