Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms. S Alban,  Sultan Lloyd Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Lloyd promulgated on 9th March 2016.  The underlying decision that  was
    the subject of the appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal  ("FtT")  was
    the decision of the respondent dated  9th  April  2015  to  refuse  the
    appellant entry clearance  to  the  UK.   The  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer ("ECO") was maintained  following  a  review  by  the
    Entry Clearance Manager on 21st June 2015.


 2. On 30th November 2014, the appellant made an  on-line  application  for
    entry clearance as a partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.   Her sponsor was Mr.  Abdulnoor  Abdulrahman  Qaid,  a  British
    Citizen.  In her on-line application, the  appellant  stated  that  her
    fiancï¿½e was in the UK and they were planning to  get  married  on  12th
    December 2014 before  the  interview  appointment.   An  interview  was
    arranged for 19th January 2015 in  Dubai.   The  appellant  married  Mr
    AAbdulnoor Qaid on 9th  December  2014.   The  appellant  completed  an
    Appendix 2 (VAF 4A) form in which she confirmed that she had first  met
    her sponsor in February 2004  and  that  their  relationship  began  in
    February 2004.  She also confirmed on that form, that she  had  married
    on 9th December 2014 in Yemen and that she  keeps  in  touch  with  her
    sponsor by phone, Viber and WhatsApp.  She confirmed that she had  been
    living with her husband since they got married


 3. The ECO was satisfied that the  appellant  was  married,  but  was  not
    satisfied that the relationship between the appellant and  her  partner
    was genuine and subsisting.  Similarly, the ECO was not satisfied  that
    the appellant and her partner intended to live together permanently  in
    the UK.  The application for entry clearance as a partner was therefore
    refused because the ECO was not satisfied that the  appellant  met  all
    the requirements of Section E-ECP of Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The ECO was not satisfied that the  requirements  of  E-ECP.2.6
    and 2.10 were met.


 4. The decision of the  ECO  to  refuse  entry  clearance  was  maintained
    following a review by the Entry Clearance  Manager,  after  considering
    all the supporting documents provided, the information as  declared  on
    the application form, the refusal notice and the grounds for appeal.


 5. The decision of the FtT Judge sets out the background to the appeal and
    the proceedings before him at paragraphs [1] to [3]  of  the  decision.
    At paragraphs [4] to [5] of  the  decision,  the  Judge  sets  out  the
    appellant's claim and at paragraphs [6] to [9] the Judge refers to  the
    respondent's  reasons  for  refusing  the  application.   The   Judge's
    findings and reasons for dismissing the  appeal  are  to  be  found  at
    paragraphs [15] to [25] of his decision.   There  are  several  reasons
    given by the Judge for his  conclusion,  at  [23],  that  the  evidence
    presented to him did not persuade him on balance, that the relationship
    is genuine or subsisting, or that the couple genuinely intend  to  live
    together in the UK.   Having reached that conclusion, the Judge  found,
    at [25], that the right to family life under Article 8 is  not  engaged
    and there were no other reasons before him to "go outside' the rules.


 6. The appellant's grounds of appeal identify several areas in  which  the
    appellant contends, the Judge erred in his assessment of  the  evidence
    before him. Permission to appeal was granted by FtT Judge  Campbell  on
    19th August 2016.   FtT  Judge  Campbell  noted  that  the  transcripts
    recording  electronic  communication  between  the  appellant  and  her
    sponsor did contain messages in English and  included  the  appellant's
    telephone number and the date of each communication.  It  is  therefore
    arguable that the Judge erred in attaching no weight at  all,  to  that
    evidence.  Similarly, it is arguable that the Judge  erred  in  finding
    that there was no evidence of the wedding, when a video  of  the  event
    was available to be viewed at the hearing.   Permission to  appeal  was
    granted on all grounds.  The matter comes before me to consider whether
    the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law, and if so, to remake the decision.


 7. The respondent has filed a rule 24 response dated 5th  September  2015.
    The respondent opposes the appeal and contends that the Judge has given
    ample reasons why this appeal was dismissed.  The  respondent  contends
    that any error in the assessment  of  a  small  number  of  transcripts
    recording electronic communication in English,  between  the  appellant
    and her sponsor, does not amount to a material error of law capable  of
    affecting the outcome of the appeal.





Discussion


 8. The appellant seeks to appeal findings made by the FtT Judge,  who  had
    the opportunity of hearing the evidence  of  the  appellant's  sponsor,
    albeit, the appellant was unrepresented.  The issue for me to decide is
    whether the Judge was entitled to make the findings that he did on  the
    evidence before him, and to conclude that on balance, the  relationship
    between the appellant and sponsor is not  genuine  or  subsisting,  and
    that the couple do not genuinely intend to live together in the UK.


 9. In that respect, I follow the guidance of the Court of Appeal  in  R  &
    ors (Iran) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982.  The Court of Appeal held that a
    finding might only be set aside for error of  law  on  the  grounds  of
    perversity if it was  irrational  or  unreasonable  in  the  Wednesbury
    sense, or one that was wholly unsupported by the evidence.   A  finding
    that  is  "perverse"  embraces  findings   that   are   irrational   or
    unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense, and findings  of  fact  that  are
    wholly unsupported by the evidence.  I remind myself  that  on  appeal,
    the Upper Tribunal should not overturn a judgment  at  first  instance,
    unless it really could not  understand  the  original  judge's  thought
    process when he was making material findings. I apply that guidance  to
    my consideration of the decision in this appeal.


10. I have also had regard to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Shizad
    (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 00085 IAC where it  was
    stated in the head note that:


         "Although there is a legal duty to give a brief explanation of  the
         conclusions on the central issue on which the appeal is determined,
         those reasons need not be extensive if  the  decision  as  a  whole
         makes sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge."


11. The Judge found, at [15], that he could not attach any  weight  to  the
    evidence relied upon  by  the  appellant  of  electronic  communication
    between the appellant and her husband because the communication  is  in
    Arabic, and no translation had been provided.   Ms  Alban  submits  the
    Judge  erred  in  failing  to  give  any  weight  to   the   electronic
    communications between the appellant  and  sponsor.  She  advances  two
    reasons.  First, some of the messages are in English and  therefore  do
    not require translation.  Second, the appellant's phone number, and the
    date of the communication are clearly visible in English on the  copies
    relied upon.  She submits the appellant's phone number is  recorded  in
    the application for Entry Clearance and although the content of all the
    communications has not been translated, the evidence  produced  clearly
    demonstrates continued communication  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor.


12. Mr Mills accepts  that  there  were  some  communications  between  the
    appellant and her sponsor that were in  English,  but  they  were  very
    limited. He submits, that the Judge records at  paragraph  [3]  of  his
    decision that he has taken careful account of all the documents  before
    him, including some text messages provided on the day of  the  hearing.
    Mr Mills accepts that the Judge erred in concluding that he  could  not
    attach any weight to that evidence, but submits that any error  in  the
    Judge's approach to that evidence is  immaterial.   He  submits  it  is
    impossible to establish from the very limited transcripts  relied  upon
    by the appellant, the year in which those communications took place and
    whether the messages pre-date or post-date the decision under appeal.


13. I have carefully considered the transcripts of the messages  that  were
    before the FtT and those that the sponsor handed to the  Judge  at  the
    hearing.   The  transcripts  that  were  before  the   Judge   in   the
    respondent's bundle demonstrate intermittent communication between 26th
    February 2014  to  31st  December  2014.  There  is  evidence  of  some
    communication in English on Sunday 10th  January,  and  Wednesday  13th
    January, in the transcripts that the sponsor handed to the Judge at the
    hearing.   The year is not, as Mr Mills submits, identified,  but  they
    can only relate to 2016 (10th January 2016 fell on  a  Sunday)  and  so
    that communication plainly post-dates the decision under appeal.


14. In my judgment, although the Judge erred in stating that he attached no
    weight to the evidence  of  electronic  communications,  any  error  is
    immaterial and not capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal.  The
    Judge did not reach the conclusion that  the  electronic  communication
    was not between the appellant and the sponsor.  Rather, the Judge found
    that he could not attach any weight  to  the  electronic  communication
    because it is in Arabic and no translation had been provided.


15. The only evidence of electronic communication between the appellant and
    her sponsor that pre-dated the decision under appeal was that which  is
    all  in  Arabic,  and  was  untranslated.    The   only   evidence   of
    communication in English was the communications on Sunday 10th January,
    and Wednesday 13th January 2016.  In the absence of any translation  of
    the other conversations, the Judge could not in any event have attached
    any significant weight to the evidence  that  would  be  sufficient  to
    establish that the relationship between the appellant and  the  sponsor
    is genuine or subsisting, or that the couple genuinely intend  to  live
    together in the UK. In any event, the Judge  gave  a  number  of  other
    reasons for his conclusion that on balance,  the  relationship  between
    the appellant and sponsor is not genuine or subsisting,  and  that  the
    couple do not genuinely intend to live together in the UK.


16. At paragraph [16] of his decision, the Judge states  that  he  attaches
    little weight to two photographs that  it  was  claimed,  were  of  the
    appellant and the sponsor, because the copies provided were  such  that
    the Judge had little confidence in identifying  the  sponsor  from  the
    photos.  Ms Alban submits the Judge erred in failing to give any weight
    to the photographs because the sponsor  had  the  original  photographs
    with him at the hearing, and  if  the  Judge  had  concerns  about  the
    quality of the photographs and what they showed, that could  have  been
    resolved at the hearing.  Mr Mills submits that the  photographs  could
    not carry  much  weight  because  as  the  Judge  notes,  there  is  no
    information as to where and  when  those  photographs  were  taken.   I
    reject the submission  made  by  Ms  Alban  that  the  Judge  erred  in
    attaching no weight to the photographs.  The Judge states at  paragraph
    [16] that he was able to give little weight  to  the  photographs.   He
    does not say that he attaches no weight to the photographs.  The  Judge
    gives two reasons for attaching little weight to them.  First,  he  had
    little confidence in identifying the sponsor  from  the  pictures,  and
    second, there was nothing in the pictures which gave  any  clue  as  to
    when or when they were taken.  In my judgement,  it  was  open  to  the
    Judge to attach little weight to the photographs, for  the  reasons  he
    has given.


17. The appellant also contends that the Judge erred at paragraph  [17]  of
    the decision, in his assessment of  the  appellant's  wedding  and  his
    surprise at the lack of photographs of  the  wedding  in  the  evidence
    before him.  Ms Alban submits the photographs  had  been  submitted  in
    support of the application for entry clearance and in  any  event,  the
    marriage was not in issue.  In my judgement, it is clear from a careful
    reading of paragraph [17] of  the  decision  that  although  the  Judge
    expresses some surprise at there being no evidence, such as photographs
    of the wedding in the documents before  him,  he  does  not  weigh  the
    absence of that evidence against the appellant.   The  Judge  noted  at
    paragraph [6] that the respondent had accepted that the  appellant  and
    sponsor were married and he notes at paragraph [17] that the respondent
    had mentioned in the refusal that a photograph of the wedding had  been
    seen.


18.  The appellant contends that  the  Judge  misunderstood  the  sponsor's
    evidence as to their plans for when the appellant arrives in the UK  at
    paragraph [20], and at paragraph [22] of his decision, as  to  why  the
    appellant cannot travel to Dubai to meet his there. Ms Alban submits it
    is unfair to say that no thought or discussion had  taken  place  about
    what the appellant intended to do in the  UK  and  that  the  appellant
    could not travel to Dubai because of the war that  had  broken  out  in
    Yemen.   Mr Mills submits the observations made by the Judge  upon  the
    evidence are accurate, and were properly  open  to  the  Judge  on  the
    evidence.


19. I reject the submissions made by Ms Alban on behalf of  the  appellant.
    The Judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence of the sponsor  and
    making his own assessment of the evidence.  The Judge notes  that  when
    asked about their plans for when the appellant arrives in the  UK,  the
    sponsor vaguely stated "she can do whatever she wants".  That is not  a
    misunderstanding of the evidence, but an observation that the Judge was
    entitled  to  make  about  the  evidence  before  him.   Similarly,  at
    paragraph [22] the Judge notes that the  sponsor  says  that  his  wife
    cannot travel to Dubai to meet him there, but was not clear about  why.
    If, as Ms Alban submits,  the  appellant  could  not  travel  to  Dubai
    because of the war that had broken out in Yemen, it  was  open  to  the
    sponsor to provide that explanation to  the  Judge,  but  he  does  not
    appear to have done so.  In my judgement, it was open to the  Judge  to
    make the observations that he does at paragraphs [20] and [22]  of  his
    decision as to the evidence given by the sponsor when he was  assessing
    whether he could be satisfied on balance, that the relationship between
    the appellant and sponsor is  genuine  and  subsisting,  and  that  the
    couple do genuinely intend to live together in the UK.


20. Although the appellant contends that the Judge erred at paragraph  [21]
    of the decision in failing  to  attribute  any  weight  to  the  travel
    document relied upon by the appellant, Ms Alban conceded before me that
    the travel documents were, as the Judge correctly notes,  untranslated.




21. Ms Alban also submits the Judge erred in failing to adjourn the hearing
    before him to allow the  appellant  an  opportunity  to  translate  the
    untranslated documents into English.  She submits  that  the  appellant
    was unrepresented and as the  Judge  considered  the  documents  to  be
    critical, he should have adjourned  the  hearing.   Ms  Alban  concedes
    before me that there was no application for an adjournment made  by  or
    on behalf of the appellant.  The burden was plainly upon the  appellant
    to establish, on a balance of probabilities that  the  requirements  of
    the immigration rules were met.  The appellant was aware of the matters
    in issue.  They had been identified in the decision of the ECO.  In the
    absence of any application for an adjournment, I cannot see  any  basis
    upon which the Judge can be  criticised  for  failing  to  adjourn  the
    hearing.


22. I have carefully read the decision of the FtT Judge.  I have  carefully
    considered whether the Judge's decision read as a  whole,  discloses  a
    material error of law. I  have  no  reason  to  doubt  that  the  Judge
    considered the evidence as a whole, in  completing  an  individual  and
    fact-specific inquiry as to the appellant's appeal.  In  my  judgement,
    the Judge properly considered the evidence before him and explained his
    reasons for his finding that on balance, the relationship  between  the
    appellant and sponsor is not genuine or subsisting, and that the couple
    do not genuinely intend to live together in the UK, in a way  that  the
    parties can understand why they have won or lost.  In my judgment,  the
    grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant amount to a disagreement
    with findings that were open to the Judge, on the material before him.


23. Overall I am not satisfied that the Judge fell into material  error  of
    law capable of affecting the outcome of the  appeal.  In  my  judgment,
    upon a holistic reading of the decision, it cannot  be  said  that  the
    Judge's analysis of the evidence is irrational or perverse.  The  Judge
    did not consider irrelevant factors, and the weight that he attached to
    the evidence either individually or cumulatively, was a matter for him.
    I am satisfied that the Judge's decision  is  a  sufficiently  reasoned
    decision that was open to him on the evidence.


24. The appeal is dismissed.
