                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The parties are as above, but are referred to in the  rest  of  this
       determination as in the First-tier Tribunal.


    2. The SSHD appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge McGrade, promulgated on 23 January 2014.

    3. The point at issue is whether the judge was right to apply �245AA of
       the Rules to deficiencies in a bank letter  which  was  undated  and
       failed to  name  the  first  appellant.   He  said  at  �11  of  his
       determination that the letter was "in the wrong format" and the SSHD
       should have given her the chance to put this right.

    4. Mrs O'Brien submitted along the lines of the SSHD's  grounds,  which
       maintain that these were not minor omissions but requirements of the
       Rules; that the judge gave no adequate  reasons  for  finding  these
       omissions to amount to being in the wrong format;  and  that  "wrong
       format" relates to the way information is presented, not to  failure
       to include specified information.  She referred  us  to  Akhter  and
       another (paragraph 245AA: wrong format) [2014] UKUT 00297 (IAC).

    5. The appellants' representatives made submissions  by  letter  of  15
       July 2014.  A copy of a bank letter is said to be attached, obtained
       at a later date, to show that had the first appellant been given the
       chance she could have made matters good.  Unfortunately, the copy is
       entirely illegible, but nothing turns on that, unless  it  is  shown
       the respondent should have asked the appellant if she could  improve
       her application.

    6. The letter also says that  "evidential  flexibility  policy"  should
       have been applied, and  that  it  might  be  "in  the  interests  of
       justice" not to decide  this  case  in  advance  of  Rodriguez  (now
       Mandalia) being heard "in the coming month" in the Supreme Court.

    7. We reserved our determination.

    8. There is no good reason not to  decide  this  case  on  the  law  as
       presently settled.

    9. Mrs O'Brien was correct that Akhter is  in  point.   That  case  was
       decided by a panel comprising the President,  The  Hon.  Mr  Justice
       McCloskey, and Upper Tribunal  Judge  Clive  Lane.   The  report  is
       headnoted:

           A bank letter,  which  does  not  specify  the  postal  address,
           landline telephone number  and  email  address  of  the  account
           holders is not thereby "in the wrong format" for the purposes of
           paragraph  245AA  of  the  immigration  rules   (documents   not
           submitted with applications).

   10. There was nothing before the First-tier Tribunal (or before  us)  to
       suggest that this case might  be  governed  by  any  policy  of  the
       respondent  more  liberal  than  the  terms  of   �245AA,   as   the
       appellants' solicitors have rather vaguely suggested.  In  fact,  we
       are fairly confident from the history set out in the case  law  that
       there is no such policy.





   11. As in Akhter, giving �245AA(b) its ordinary and natural meaning,  it
       does not apply to the shortcomings in this application.  Put another
       way, as in the SSHD's grounds, this was not a case of  an  incorrect
       format but of missing information.   The judge was not  entitled  to
       hold that the appellants should have been given  an  opportunity  to
       rectify the deficiencies in the application.

   12. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside,  and  we
       substitute  the  following  decision:  the  appeals,  as  originally
       brought by the appellants to the First-tier Tribunal, are dismissed.
