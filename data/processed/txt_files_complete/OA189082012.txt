For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sudan born on 1  January  1982.   He  has
    been granted permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Buckwell dismissing his appeal against the  decision  of
    the Respondent made on 1 September 2012 refusing him entry clearance to
    the UK as the spouse of Wifaq El Sheikh in the UK for settlement.   The
    refusal was made under paragraph 281 of HC 395 as amended and Article 8
    of the ECHR.

2.   The appellant made his application on 4 July 2012 and the  decision  of
    the respondent was made on 1 September 2012.   In  accordance  with  AS
    Somalia  and  another  [2009]  UKHL  32  the  Tribunal  is  limited  to
    considering evidence as at the date of the respondent's decision.

3.   The appellant's sponsor is a British citizen born on 27 May 1982.   She
    lives in London.  The appellant first met her in 2008 in Sudan.   Their
    marriage took place in Khartoum on 5 September 2011.   It  was  not  an
    arranged marriage but the parties are related.  The respective  mothers
    are cousins.  They stayed  together  as  man  and  wife  following  the
    marriage  until  15  October  2011.   The  judge  accepted   that   the
    relationship between the appellant and the sponsor was genuine.

4.   The sponsor who gave evidence at the hearing said she  occupied  a  one
    bedroom property and it was the intention of the couple that they would
    reside there if the appellant were granted entry  clearance  to  settle
    with her in the UK.  The judge accepted that  the  sponsor  occupied  a
    housing association property in Tower Hamlets.  Although her  landlords
    at one stage sought possession of the flat due to her rental arrears, a
    court order was in place  and  evidence  subsisted  to  show  that  the
    sponsor was adhering to the  rental  payment  requirements  under  that
    order.  As to her future intentions she indicated at the  hearing  that
    when circumstances permit, she would  wish  to  pay  off  arrears  with
    larger sums.  Of greater significance in this respect  was  the  letter
    from the housing association dated 30 April 2013.  Although dated  more
    recently, the judge was satisfied that it  reflects  the  view  of  the
    housing association generally.  On that basis the judge  was  satisfied
    that the accommodation requirements under paragraph 281 were met as  at
    the date of the respondent's decision.

5.   The outstanding requirement  on  which  the  judge  needed  to  make  a
    finding was the issue of maintenance.  He bore in mind that he  had  to
    consider evidence as at  the  date  of  the  respondent's  decision,  1
    September 2012.

6.   The evidence before the judge was that at the date of  the  application
    the  sponsor  was  employed  on  a  part-time  basis  as  a   volunteer
    administrator with the Salama Community  Association  in  Brixton.   In
    addition she was studying homeopathic medicine.  She was in receipt  of
    her student loan/grant in the sum of �7,700.  Her rent arrears as at  3
    May 2012 exceeded �2,500.  She received funds on a monthly basis in the
    approximate sum of �120 from her husband.  That was the evidence before
    the ECO.

7.   At the hearing before the  judge,  a  schedule  of  stated  income  and
    outgoings with respect to the sponsor was provided.  It stated that the
    sponsor on a monthly basis had an excess of income  over  outgoings  in
    the sum of �350.14.  The  income  comprised  of  the  earnings  of  the
    sponsor at the time which was �421.53 a month plus a sum contributed to
    her finances by way of the student loan/grant in the sum of �7,662  for
    the academic year 2011/2012.  According to the schedule this  gave  her
    �638.50 per month.  The sponsor in evidence said that the  payment  was
    to cover the period until the end of September 2012,  which  the  judge
    accepted.  In the schedule it was stated that the sponsor was  required
    to demonstrate a weekly income in the sum of  �111.45.   On  a  monthly
    basis there was a deficit of �132.81, but it was stated  that  she  had
    savings as at 17 May 2012 in the sum of �3,580.06.

8.   The judge noted that  in  the  sponsor's  NatWest  Select  Account  the
    credit balance stood at �18.91 as at 19 July 2012.  It did not increase
    until 6 November 2012 (after the date of the decision).  In relation to
    the appellant's NatWest First  Reserve  Account,  there  was  a  credit
    balance in the sum of �840.52 as at 20 August 2012.  In  the  financial
    statement provided for the appeal, a  credit  balance  in  the  sum  of
    �3,580.06 was relied on.  The judge noted however that the balance  was
    at 17 May 2012.  By 3 July 2012 (the day before the respondent received
    the appellant's application) that balance had reduced to �2,130.52.  By
    the date of decision it  had  reduced  to  �840.52.   The  judge  found
    therefore that the savings figure quoted in the financial schedule  was
    incorrect for the purposes of the consideration of the finances of  the
    sponsor overall as at the date of either the  respondent's  receipt  of
    the application or the date of the respondent's decision.

9.   The judge noted that the income calculated included the  student  loan.
    He found it relevant however to take into account the balances  in  the
    accounts held by the sponsor.  With respect  to  the  Barclays  Student
    Additions Account, as at 7 August 2012 there was a  credit  balance  in
    the sum of �130.53.  No copy of the August/September statement for that
    account was provided.  From the September/October statement  the  judge
    saw that the opening balance in that account on 13 September  2012  had
    reduced to �70.99.  A Barclays Higher Education  Account  held  in  the
    name of the sponsor had a credit balance in the sum of �113.24 as at 30
    August 2012.

10.  The judge noted that although the sponsor was  paying  rent  subsequent
    to a county court order, it remained the  fact  that  the  sponsor  had
    arrears in relation to her rent which exceeded  �2,000.   Although  the
    time period is after the date of decision, the sponsor indicated at the
    hearing that she was now in receipt of benefits.   She  had  also  said
    that she was paying �111.45 rent each week.  This meant  that  she  was
    contributing �5,795.40 for the rent on an annual basis.   However  more
    recent statements from the landlords indicated that she was paying only
    �200 each month (at  least  since  November  2012).   In  addition  she
    currently receives housing benefit in the sum of �548.40 each month and
    has done so since November 2012.  That appeared to be contrary  to  her
    evidence.

11.  The judge  noted  that  the  appellant's  representative  did  not  put
    forward figures in relation to any income or savings of  the  appellant
    himself which might be taken into account in  considering  whether  the
    maintenance requirements of paragraph 281 were satisfied.  There was no
    official documentation or any official calculation of sums  claimed  to
    be held or earned by the appellant himself.   His  representatives  had
    not sought to include any element of the income or claimed  savings  of
    the appellant himself in the financial schedule presented.

12.  In light of the financial information before  him  the  judge  did  not
    find that the finance available to the sponsor was sufficient  to  meet
    the  requirements  of  paragraph  281  of  HC  395  with  reference  to
    maintenance as at the date of decision.

13.  Counsel relied on his grounds.

14.  In his first ground, he argued that the judged failed to apply  KA  and
    Others (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 which sets
    out the benchmark for adequacy of maintenance; that the  applicant  and
    sponsor would be at least as  well  off  as  an  equivalent  couple  in
    receipt of benefits. Accordingly, the correct test for  maintenance  is
    whether the sponsor's income, at the date of decision, is the  same  as
    the couple would be entitled to if  they  were  in  receipt  of  income
    support.   In the grounds it was  said  the  appellant's  per  calendar
    monthly income at the date of decision was �1,059 but at the hearing it
    was �1,060, a difference of �1. The income support rate for a couple at
    the date of decision was �111.45 per week.  According to  the  schedule
    this was �482.95 a month.  Counsel submitted that the  judge  erred  in
    considering  the  sponsor's  levels  of  savings  and  other  financial
    outgoings (over and above housing) costs in concluding her  income  was
    insufficient.  It was irrelevant to weigh the sponsor's income  against
    her expenditure.  In considering whether the sponsor's  income  reached
    �482.95 per month, it was irrelevant  to  weigh  the  sponsor's  income
    against her expenditure.

15.  I find that although the judge did not  specifically  mention  that  he
    had considered the financial evidence in the context of  KA,  this  was
    not material to his decision.  The schedule  provided  by  the  sponsor
    gave her monthly income as �1060.30. This was made up  of  earnings  of
    �421.53 per month from her employment at Salama Community  Association,
    and a student loan of �638 per month.  The only  expenditure  that  was
    deducted from the income was her rent of �709.89 per month, which  left
    her with a total income of �350.14 per month, which did not  reach  the
    income support level of �482.95 per month for a couple  in  receipt  of
    benefits.  No other financial outgoings were taken into account in  the
    schedule.  Consequently, on the evidence in  the  schedule  alone,  the
    sponsor's income was not sufficient to meet the maintenance requirement
    under the Immigration Rules. This  would  explain  why  the  judge,  at
    paragraph 41, considered the funds in the sponsor's savings account  to
    see whether those funds were sufficient to meet the deficit  identified
    in the schedule of  income  and  outgoings.   In  light  of  the  rapid
    depletion of funds in the various bank accounts held by the sponsor  by
    the date of decision, the judge's finding that the finance available to
    the sponsor was insufficient to meet the requirements of paragraph  281
    of HC395 was sustainable and without legal error.


16.  The second ground Counsel relied on was his  argument  that  the  judge
    failed to consider prospects of the appellant gaining  employment.   He
    relied on Chapter 9.5 of the ECO guidance which states "The ECO must be
    satisfied that the applicant  has  reasonable  prospects  of  obtaining
    employment in the UK.  It is not necessary to see actual evidence  that
    a specific job has been arranged.  However, you should always  consider
    whether plans are realistic."  In light of this guidance Counsel argued
    that the appellant is a qualified doctor and he intends to find work in
    the UK.  The judge erred in failing to consider whether on the  balance
    of probabilities the appellant would be able  to  find  work  within  a
    reasonable time.

17.   The  respondent's  Rule  24  reply  stated  that  the  judge  did  not
    materially err in law in not  considering  whether  the  appellant  had
    prospects with regards employment in the UK.  He was constrained by the
    2002 Act to considering facts at the date of decision  and/or  evidence
    appertaining to circumstances at the date of decision.   There  was  no
    evidence of prospective employment, and  therefore  no  requirement  to
    consider it.

18.  Mr Tufan drew my attention to the  grounds  of  appeal  lodged  by  the
    appellant against the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer.   There
    was no mention in the grounds that because the appellant was a  doctor,
    there was a reasonable prospect of the appellant  obtaining  employment
    within a reasonable time after his arrival in the UK.  That  issue  had
    been raised by the judge himself at paragraph 22 of the  determination.
    He had asked the sponsor whether her husband had made  enquiries  about
    potential employment in the United Kingdom.  She said he had taken  but
    failed the MRC test and that he was planning to take the PLAB test.

19.  Whilst I accept that the judge failed to consider whether at  the  date
    of decision the  appellant  had  a  reasonable  prospect  of  obtaining
    employment in the UK. I find that his failure did not materially affect
    his decision.  The only evidence that the appellant  intended  to  find
    work in the UK as a doctor came via the sponsor's evidence that he  was
    planning to take the  PLAB  test.   There  was  no  evidence  from  the
    appellant himself as to his realistic chance of passing the  PLAB  test
    to enable him to find work in the UK as a doctor.  In  the  absence  of
    such evidence, I find that the judge did not materially err in  law  by
    not considering this issue.

20.  Thirdly, Counsel argued that having found that the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor intended to live permanently with each other for the purpose of
    paragraph 281(iii), the judge perversely concluded that  they  did  not
    enjoy family life.  His argument was in respect of the judge's  finding
    at paragraph 46.  The judge found as follows:

         "46. With respect to human rights grounds it is clear  to  me  that
             any family life rights enjoyed between the appellant  and  the
             sponsor have been whilst the sponsor has visited him in Sudan.
              She is able to continue to visit Sudan, a country with  which
             she is now familiar.  On that basis I do  not  find  that  the
             decision  by  the  respondent,  whilst  I  accept  the   lower
             threshold in that regard, engages the terms of Article 8(1) of
             the European Convention.  Accordingly  I  do  not  proceed  to
             consider proportionality."

21.  I do not  read  into  paragraph  46  that  the  judge  found  that  the
    appellant and the sponsor did not enjoy  family  life.  The  judge  had
    accepted that the relationship between the appellant  and  the  sponsor
    was genuine.  This means that as a married couple they  enjoyed  family
    life together which satisfied the first of the Razgar  questions.   The
    judge however found that Article  8(1)  was  not  engaged  because  the
    respondent's decision did not  interfere  with  the  family  life  they
    currently  enjoyed,  which  consisted  of  the  sponsor  visiting   the
    appellant in Sudan.  I find not error of law in the judge's decision.

22.  Counsel further  argued  in  his  grounds  that  the  judge  failed  to
    consider the sponsor's pregnancy in his assessment  of  Article  8  and
    that the sponsor and appellant's child will be born a British  citizen.
    On this issue I agree with Mr. Tufan's submission that at the  date  of
    the ECO's decision the sponsor was not pregnant.  Since the  judge  was
    constrained by the 2002 Act and  by  the  decision  in  AS  Somalia  to
    considering facts at the date of decision, his failure to consider  the
    sponsor's pregnancy which occurred after the date of decision does  not
    amount to an error of law.

23.  I that the judge did not err in law.  The judge's  decision  dismissing
    the appellant's appeal shall stand.
