Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr S Karim, instructed by Kalam Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Meah promulgated  4  January  2019,  dismissing  on  all
    grounds his appeal against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 22 November 2017, to refuse his application made  on  5  December
    2016 for Leave to Remain on human  rights  grounds,  on  the  basis  of
    family life with his British citizen partner and young child.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Murray granted  permission  to  appeal  on  4
    February 2019, on the basis that it was arguable that the  judge  erred
    in placing too high a  burden  on  the  appellant  in  establishing  an
    innocent explanation to discharge the evidential burden transferred  to
    him by the  Secretary  of  State's  generic  evidence  discharging  the
    initial evidential burden that he had used deception  in  obtaining  an
    ETS English language test result in 2012, and  in  considering  whether
    such an explanation had been provided failing to take  account  of  the
    correspondence between the appellant's representatives and ETS.

 3. Judge Murray found "no arguable error in relation (to)  the  assessment
    of whether it would be reasonable for the appellant's child  to  follow
    the appellant to Bangladesh." In respect of this part of  the  decision
    of Judge Murray, the appellant renewed his application  for  permission
    to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.  However,  in  his  decision  of  21
    February 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Blum refused "permission  to  appeal
    on grounds already rejected by the First-tier Tribunal."

 4. At the error of law hearing before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Black on
    5 March 2019 the appellant  attempted  to  renew  his  application  for
    permission to appeal on grounds relating to the article 8  family  life
    with his partner and qualifying child, relying  on  Rule  5(2)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. At [9] of her  decision
    Judge Black rejected the application "as there was no  such  power  for
    renewal of grounds of appeal in Rule 5 and further  the  appellant  had
    exhausted all steps open to him; his application having  been  rejected
    by the FTTJ and on renewal  by  UTJ  Blum  with  which  I  concur."  In
    consequence, Judge Black dealt only with the ETS deception issue. Judge
    Black's decision promulgated 19 March 2019 found no error  of  law  and
    dismissed the appeal.

 5. The appellant then sought to appeal both issues to the Court of Appeal.
    The application was considered by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill, who in her
    decision of 18 April 2019 set aside Judge Black's decision pursuant  to
    Rules 45(a) and 46 of the Procedure Rules. Judge Gill  pointed  to  the
    decision of the Upper Tribunal in Safi and others (permission to appeal
    decisions) [2018] UKUT 00388 (IAC), which held that  it  was  essential
    that a judge granting permission to appeal only on limited  grounds  to
    say so, in terms, in the section of the  standard  form  document  that
    contains the decision, as opposed to the reasons. "It is likely  to  be
    only in very exceptional circumstances that the Upper Tribunal will  be
    persuaded to entertain a submission that  a  decision,  which,  on  its
    face, grants permission to appeal without express limitation is  to  be
    construed as anything other than a grant of permission on  all  of  the
    grounds accompanying the application for permission, regardless of what
    might be said in the reasons for decision  section  of  the  document."
    Judge Gill was satisfied that properly read, Judge  Murray's  grant  of
    permission to appeal did not  limit  the  grounds  of  application.  It
    follows that Judge Black  erred  in  law  in  refusing  to  permit  the
    appellant to rely on all of his grounds.

 6. The matter then came before us on 3 June 2019, sitting as  a  panel  of
    the Upper Tribunal, for a reconsideration of the error of  law  appeal,
    with both ETS and family life as live issues.

 7. In the intervening period since the promulgation  of  the  decision  of
    Judge Meah, the relevant case law has moved rapidly on.  In  particular
    in JG (s 117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey  [2019]  UKUT  00072
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal panel including the President  held  that  in
    assessing the 'reasonableness test' outside the Rules under  article  8
    ECHR, section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 requires a court or tribunal to  hypothesise  that  the  child  in
    question would leave the United Kingdom, even if this is not likely  to
    be the case, and ask whether it would be reasonable to expect the child
    to do so. Obviously, following KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 this applies
    to the similar 'reasonableness test' under EX1(a) of Appendix FM of the
    Immigration Rules in respect  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child whether "taking into account their
    best interests as a primary consideration, it would not  be  reasonable
    to expect the child to leave the UK."

 8. In the light of the current case law and the unchallenged findings that
    the appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  both  his
    partner and child,  both  British  citizens,  Mr  Avery  very  properly
    conceded that he could not resist the appeal in respect of the  article
    8 ECHR family life grounds outside the Rules.

 9. However, that was not the end of the matter as the Secretary  of  State
    maintains its reliance on the Reasons for Refusal  decision  and  Judge
    Murray's dismissal of the appeal  on  the  ETS  grounds.  It  was  also
    suggested to us that the nature of  any  leave  the  appellant  may  be
    entitled to depends on whether his appeal succeeds under the  Rules  or
    only outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR. In any event, whether that
    is correct or  not,  a  finding  of  the  employment  of  deception  in
    obtaining  an  ETS  English  language  test  result  is  likely  to  be
    problematic for the appellant in succeeding in any  future  application
    for further Leave to Remain.

10. The appellant's application for Leave to Remain was rejected under  the
    suitability provisions of the Rules on the basis of  alleged  deception
    in obtaining an ETS English language test certificate from  the  London
    College of  Media  &  Technology  in  2012.  The  lookup  tool  in  the
    respondent's bundle confirms that the appellant took the test on 15 May
    2012 and obtained high scores of  190  in  each  of  the  speaking  and
    writing parts of the test. At Annex 2, the results for that college  on
    15 May 2012 indicate that 48 tests were taken of which  all  have  been
    rejected, with 43 (90%) regarded as 'Questionable' and the remaining  5
    (10%) as 'Invalid." The appellant's results were  invalidated  and  not
    merely questionable. The Home Office Project Faï¿½ade report of May 2015,
    copied in the respondent's bundle, indicates that  a  criminal  inquiry
    into the London College of Media and Technology  has  revealed  that  a
    total  of  2,389  tests  were  taken,  of  which  1,356   were   deemed
    questionable and 1,033 (43%) were invalidated, suggesting that stronger
    evidence was relied on to invalidate test results rather than  mere  to
    deem them 'questionable.' The respondent also relied on what has become
    known  as  the  generic  evidence,  detailing  the  investigation   and
    assessment processes used by ETS to invalidate results.

11. We were referred to SM and Qadir v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT  00229  (IAC)
    where the Upper Tribunal panel including the then President held  that:
    "(i) The Secretary of  State's  generic  evidence,  combined  with  her
    evidence particular to these two appellants, sufficed to discharge  the
    evidential burden of proving that their  TOEIC  certificates  had  been
    procured by dishonesty. (ii) However, given the multiple frailties from
    which this generic evidence was considered to suffer and, in the  light
    of the evidence adduced by the appellants (in  that  particular  case),
    the Secretary of State failed to discharge the legal burden of  proving
    dishonesty on their part." At [57] the Upper Tribunal held  that  there
    was an evidential burden on the Secretary of State to adduce sufficient
    evidence to raise the issue of deception in the ETS  test  certificate.
    The burden then switches to the applicant. "(b) If  he  discharges  the
    burden, again, an evidential one - of raising an innocent  explanation,
    namely an account which satisfied the minimum level of plausibility,  a
    further  transfer  of  the  burden  of  proof  occurs."  Where  (b)  is
    satisfied, "the burden rests on the Secretary of State to establish, on
    the balance of probabilities, that the appellant's prima facie innocent
    explanation is to be rejected." This  was  endorsed  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal judgement in SM and Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167, which emphasised
    that every such case was fact-sensitive.

12. After hearing submissions from both representatives, we found force  in
    Mr Karim's submissions that Judge Meah had applied too high a burden of
    proof  on  the  appellant  to  establish  an  'innocent   explanation.'
    Effectively, the relevant findings and reasons are set out by the judge
    relatively shortly between [28] and [36]  of  the  decision.  In  these
    paragraphs we noted that Judge Meah described the  appellant's  witness
    statement and oral evidence as variously,  vague,  ambiguous,  laconic,
    nebulous, and not reliable. However, in each case the judge  failed  to
    provide any specific reasons or example of what  was  vague,  etc.  For
    example, it was stated at [29] that the appellant's account of how  and
    why he chose the college in question was "vague at best," but the judge
    did not explain in what way, but summarises  the  appellant's  evidence
    that he had selected the particular college after Internet research and
    finding it to be nearest to his residence at the time. Similar, at [33]
    the judge had "significant concerns regarding the  nebulous  nature  of
    the appellant's evidence when pressed by (the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer) on salient points during  his  cross-examination."  Again,  no
    explanation is provided as to what in particular was  nebulous  and  no
    examples from the oral evidence were provided.

13. We note that in three consecutive paragraphs between [34] and [36]  the
    judge, in various ways, stated that the appellant failed to  provide  a
    reliable or innocent explanation or response to support his claim  that
    he did not use a proxy test-taker in order to obtain his TOEIC  English
    language certificate. The judge was satisfied that a  proxy  was  used.
    However, cogent reasoning involving an assessment  of  the  appellant's
    explanations is largely absent. In the circumstances, we found that the
    conclusions on the ETS issue were flawed and in error of law  for  want
    of cogent reasoning, such as to require the decision to be set aside.

14. We considered with the  two  representatives  the  appropriate  further
    course for the remaking  of  the  decision  in  the  appeal.  Mr  Karim
    indicated that he was in a position to call the appellant  in  evidence
    and to make  submissions.  We  accepted  that  Mr  Avery  had  not  had
    sufficient time to prepare for examination of  the  appellant  in  oral
    evidence and it transpired that he did not have available to him a copy
    of the appellant's bundle, including  his  witness  statement.  In  the
    circumstances, we put the matter back in the list and  dealt  with  our
    other appeals before adjourning to allow Mr Avery time to  prepare  for
    the continuation of the appeal hearing with a copy of  the  appellant's
    bundle.

The Oral Evidence

15. On resumption of the appeal hearing, and with Mr Avery confirming  that
    he was ready to proceed, Mr Karim called the  appellant  to  give  oral
    evidence. He relied on his witness statement of 14 December  2018,  and
    on the other documents in his bundle, including in particular the email
    correspondence between the appellant's representatives and ETS in 2018,
    seeking further information as to why the appellant's  ETS  scores  had
    been invalidated. The appellant was then cross-examined by Mr Avery and
    the Tribunal panel asked a number of supplementary questions.

16. It is not necessary to rehearse the whole of the oral evidence  but  it
    can be summarised as follows below.

17. The appellant said that when he knew  he  needed  an  English  language
    certificate he researched  the  availability  of  testing  centres  via
    Google and saw the London College of Media & Technology referred to  on
    the Home Office website. He selected this college because  it  was  the
    nearest to his home address in Stepney at the time. There  was  another
    college offering the test in Aldgate but this one was closer. He didn't
    bother to research how good the college was as he was  only  going  for
    the standard ETS test. The college was only a few minutes away  by  the
    DLR. Before attending for the test he had done further research on  the
    type of test and found a simple test example online which gave an  idea
    how the exam would proceed, which he said he found helpful. He did  not
    have any difficulty doing the test. He told us that he has  since  that
    test he has passed two other English language tests and  in  comparison
    found the ETS test much easier. He explained how the  test  worked  and
    said that in all he was only required to speak for a  few  minutes.  He
    saw nothing untoward at any time, even though it was pointed  out  that
    all  of  the  tests  taken  that  day  were  either   questionable   or
    invalidated. He thought that there  were  maybe  20-22  others  in  the
    waiting room but when he was called to go to a different room  to  take
    the test about half of those waiting were left behind. He did not known
    whether there was but thought it possible that they may have gone to  a
    different room for testing.

18. When he learnt in 2014 that he was accused of cheating by using a proxy
    test taker, he said he was shocked. He first called the  college  where
    he took the test and they gave him the ETS number. He  then  called  an
    ETS number, which he said was in Kent, to ask about the information  he
    had received from the Home Office invalidating his test. They took  his
    details and phone number, promising to call him back but never did.  He
    had his legal  representatives  contact  ETS  and  some  of  the  email
    correspondence is in the appellant's bundle confirms this. Later,  when
    he had heard nothing from ETS, he contacted the college again. He  also
    went to the college but found that it had closed down. Asked by us  for
    his reaction to the fact that it appears that all the tests  taken  the
    same day were either questionable or deemed invalid,  he  said  he  was
    shocked and that he had done all he could to try and find out  why.  He
    said that he had asked for the recording of his test but it  was  never
    provided. He denied again that he had used a proxy, and said there  was
    no option offered to him to use a proxy.

19. Mr Avery made brief submissions relying on the refusal decision and the
    evidence produced in support in the respondent's bundle. He pointed out
    that all the issued had been previously 'flagged up' to  the  appellant
    and he has had ample time to research to inform himself about the  test
    process. It was submitted that it was not  credible  that  he  did  not
    notice 'irregularities' going on at the test  centre,  given  that  all
    results have been rejected as either questionable or invalid. Mr  Avery
    submitted that the appellant's account did  not  establish  a  credible
    innocent explanation.

20. In his submissions, Mr Karim suggested that  the  appellant  had  given
    cogent evidence, answering confidently. He had offered  details  as  to
    how he travelled to the test centre and how he took the test. The  only
    evidence against his account is the generic  evidence  and  the  lookup
    tool from the day in question. It was submitted that the fact that  all
    the tests were  questionable  or  invalidated  suggests  fraud  at  the
    highest level and one would expect such fraudsters to be careful not to
    use proxies to pass all  applicants  as  that  would  raise  suspicion.
    Reliance was made on the email  correspondence  as  evidence  that  the
    appellant genuinely challenged the invalidation. It  was  also  pointed
    out that although the Project Faï¿½ade was a criminal investigation  from
    2015, there has been no evidence at all as to what has happened in  the
    intervening period and whether there have been any prosecutions. It was
    suggested that this evidence raised more questions than it answered.

21. Reliance was also placed on the fact that the appellant's  high  scores
    in listening and reading had  not  been  challenged  and  that  he  had
    obtained subsequence English language qualifications, including a First
    Class pass City and Guilds qualification, all of which  was  consistent
    with the English language proficiency  demonstrated  in  the  ETS  test
    results.

Findings and Reasons

22. We recognise that the appellant has given evidence before and  has  now
    had considerable time to prepare himself in relation to the  detail  of
    his taking the test in 2012. We also recognise that 2012 is some  years
    ago and even when he was first required  to  give  an  account  several
    years had already elapsed. However, even taking this into  account,  on
    the whole we  found  the  appellant  gave  his  evidence  in  an  open,
    straightforward, and consistent way. He was not  contradicted  and  did
    not vary from his witness statement and earlier  accounts.  When  asked
    for further details by Mr Avery or ourselves, he gave  clear,  detailed
    and consistent answers.

23. We also recognise that challenging appellants in  oral  evidence  about
    attendance at the test  centre  has  limited  probative  value  as  the
    appellant would have had to attend in person to  produce  his  passport
    identification and for his photo to be taken.  The  evidence  of  wide-
    scale fraud in ETS testing is to the effect that proxy test-takers were
    usually present with the candidates at the testing. It follows  that  a
    person using a proxy-test taker  to  fraudulently  obtain  the  English
    language certificate would know a good deal about the test  centre  and
    the testing process.

24. We also bear in mind that by necessity the appellant has  had  to  cast
    his mind back to events as long ago as 2012. However,  his  account  of
    how he chose the college, being nearest to  his  home,  and  the  short
    travel distance and time, seems reasonable. Adding to  his  credibility
    was the information he gave about finding the college named on the Home
    Office website and finding in advance a simple example test helping him
    understand how it would be administered on the day.

25. The generic evidence now available in such cases is  much  more  cogent
    than previously available in earlier ETS cases, supplemented by  expert
    evidence to the effect that the chances of  a  false  positive  in  the
    analysis process is vanishingly small. On  the  background  documentary
    evidence, it is difficult to understand  how  an  honest  person  could
    attend a testing centre such as this without noticing the  presence  of
    proxy test takers when not one of 2,389 tests has been upheld and  some
    1,033 invalidated. On the very day the appellant took the ETS test,  43
    of the 48 tests were found to be questionable and 5 others invalidated.
    On the other hand, we know little about the testing process in place at
    the London College of Media & Technology. We do not  know  where  there
    was one or more than one testing room and have no clear evidence as  to
    how many tests were taken simultaneously or what opportunity there  was
    to observe any irregularity. From the  appellant's  own  evidence,  not
    everyone present at 10.00 am was called to take the test  at  the  same
    time and location as him. In reality, we have very limited  information
    and there is certainly nothing before us to challenge or  question  the
    appellant's version of events. We  found  his  explanations  clear  and
    consistent.

26. Further, we have to take into account in  the  appellant's  favour  the
    challenge through correspondence of the invalidation of  his  test.  He
    also said that he had asked for the recording of his test  but  it  was
    never provided. We found his oral evidence that he had telephoned  both
    the college and ETS, and even visited the college to find it had closed
    down, persuasive.

27. Assessing all of the evidence in the round, including both the oral and
    documentary evidence, taking into account  the  factors  both  for  and
    against the  appellant  set  out  above,  we  are  satisfied  that  the
    appellant has presented an account which at the  very  least  satisfies
    the "minimum level of plausibility," discharging the evidential  burden
    on him  and  arising  from  the  generic  evidence  relied  on  by  the
    respondent.

28. It follows that the burden is on the Secretary of State  to  establish,
    on the balance of  probabilities,  that  the  appellant's  prima  facie
    innocent explanation is to be rejected. We full account of  Mr  Avery's
    challenge by  cross-examination  of  the  appellant  but  frankly  this
    effectively reinforced the appellant's credibility as he  was  able  to
    provide cogent and consistent answers to everything asked  of  him.  We
    also take full account of and do not downplay in  any  way  the  cogent
    generic evidence and the particularly  shocking  investigation  results
    for the London College of Media & Technology. However,  viewed  in  the
    round and applying the standard of a balance of probabilities, we  find
    that this evidence and the challenge made to the appellant's account is
    ultimately  insufficient  to  justify   rejection   of   his   innocent
    explanation.

29. It follows that we find for the appellant in respect of the ETS  issue.
    As he  now  does  not  fall  for  rejection  of  his  Leave  to  Remain
    application on suitability grounds, and on  the  basis  of  Mr  Avery's
    concession in respect of the  'reasonableness  test'  of  EX1(a)(i)  of
    Appendix FM, it follows that it would not be reasonable to  expect  the
    British citizen child to leave the UK, even if that is on the facts  of
    this case a merely hypothetical assessment given  that  the  child  can
    remain in the UK with the mother, applying JG.

30. It follows that, for the reasons set out  above,  the  appeal  must  be
    allowed with reference to EX1(a)(i). We find for the appellant  on  the
    ETS issue and accept the concession in  relation  to  the  family  life
    issue. It is not necessary in these circumstances for us to address the
    family life claim in any detail, except for the fact that as  there  is
    no right of appeal on  immigration  grounds  the  appeal  can  only  be
    allowed on human rights grounds, pursuant to article 8  ECHR.  However,
    if the appellant's application for Leave to Remain on  the  grounds  of
    family life with  his  British  citizen  wife  and  child  should  have
    succeeded under the Rules, it cannot said to be proportionate to refuse
    the claim outside the Rules on  article  8  family  life  grounds.  The
    decision clearly engages article 8 and whilst lawful and in pursuit  of
    the legitimate aim of protecting the economic wellbeing of  the  UK  by
    enforcement   of   immigration   requirements,   it   amounts   to    a
    disproportionate  interference  with  the  unchallenged   genuine   and
    subsisting family life he has in the UK with his wife and child.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be  set
aside.

We set aside set aside the decision.

We re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by  allowing  it  on  human  rights
grounds.
