Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Bazini, Counsel, instructed by Duncan Lewis
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal promulgated on 9 January 2012 dismissing his appeal against
   the respondent's decision made on 23 August 2012 that he is a  person  to
   whom section 32 (5) of the UK Borders Act  2007  applies.  A  deportation
   order against him was signed on the same day.

2. We make  an  order  in  respect  of  the  minor  children  in  this  case
   preventing them from being identified. That order includes a  prohibition
   on the disclosure of any information that might identify the  address  or
   school of that child. We consider that this order is in the interests  of
   the children.  Any  breach  of  this  order  occasioned  by  putting  the
   information in the public domain, such conduct might be punishable  as  a
   contempt of court either by the Upper Tribunal exercising the  powers  of
   the High Court under section 25 (2) (c)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
   Enforcement Act 2007 or by any other court of competent jurisdiction.


3. The appellant is a citizen  of  Jamaica.  He  first  entered  the  United
   Kingdom as a visitor in May 1997 using the name "Paul Williams"  and  was
   the next year joined by his partner, Ms H (also a Jamaican  citizen)  and
   their son, J, born in Jamaica in 1996.  Their second son, K, was born  in
   1999.  Later that year, the appellant was stopped by police and  returned
   to Jamaica. He had by then begun a relationship with Bernadette Taylor, a
   British citizen, and they were married on 8 December 2000, the  appellant
   by then having returned to the United Kingdom using  false  documentation
   in the name "Isaac Walters". That marriage was later dissolved.

4. The appellant was again arrested in February 2001, and again  removed  to
   Jamaica. He was by this time in a relationship with Lesley Shattock-Flynn
   who travelled to Jamaica in 2002 to marry him. He then  returned  to  the
   United Kingdom as a visitor; a subsequent application for leave to remain
   as the spouse of Ms Shattock-Flynn was refused on 22 October  2002  after
   being initially rejected.

5. On 18 December  2003  the  appellant  was  convicted  on  six  counts  of
   supplying Class A drugs and sentenced to 45 months' imprisonment. He  was
   released in November 2005 but  although  he  returned  to  live  with  Ms
   Shattock-Flynn, the marriage had broken down, and  in  2006  he  met  his
   current partner, whom we refer to as Ms P  to  avoid  their  child  being
   identified. Ms P is a British citizen.

6. On 25 July 2005, while the appellant was in prison, the  respondent  made
   a decision to deport the appellant. The appeal against that decision  was
   unsuccessful, and finally on 10 January 2008, permission to appeal to the
   Court of Appeal was refused by Sedley LJ after an oral hearing.

7. By late 2006, Ms H had become unable to look after J or K  and,  although
   Ms Shattock-Flynn had been content for them to stay at weekend,  she  did
   not want them to stay permanently. The appellant and Ms  P  then  set  up
   home together; J and K moved in with  them.  On  13  September  2008  the
   couple's son, N was born.

8. Some four months later the appellant was arrested and  was  later  on  11
   May 2009 convicted of being involved with the fraudulent  importation  of
   cocaine and the possession of a false Belgian passport for which  he  was
   sentenced to consecutive periods of 6 years and 6 months', and 6  months'
   imprisonment, making a total of 7 years imprisonment.  On  completion  of
   his criminal sentence, the appellant was and remains in  detention  under
   immigration powers.

9. Since his imprisonment, J and K have returned to live with their  mother,
   but have continued to visit the appellant in prison. Ms H  is  now  in  a
   relationship with a British  citizen,  and  she  and  the  children  have
   Discretionary Leave to Remain in  the  United  Kingdom.  Ms  P  has  also
   maintained contact with the appellant and has taken their  son  to  visit
   him.

10. On 23 August 2012,  following  the  convictions  on  11  May  2009,  the
   respondent concluded that the appellant was  a  person  to  whom  section
   32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applies, and that none of the exceptions
   set out in section 33 applied to him.  She noted that, applying paragraph
   398  of  the  Immigration  Rules  it  would  only   be   in   exceptional
   circumstances that a persons right to family and/or  private  life  would
   outweigh the public interest in deporting a person who had been sentenced
   to a period of imprisonment of over 4 years.  She  concluded  that  there
   were no exceptional circumstances

11. The respondent considered that  the  appellant  had  not  established  a
   family life in the United Kingdom, and that  any  interference  with  his
   right to respect for his private life was proportionate, given  the  need
   to prevent disorder and crime, protect health and  morals,  and  maintain
   effective immigration control.  She considered that, while the  interests
   of the appellant's children were a primary consideration, the appellant's
   removal was still proportionate given his offences.

12. The  respondent  concluded  that  the  appellant  was  no  longer  in  a
   relationship with Ms H, Ms Taylor or Ms Shattock-Flynn,  and  so  had  no
   family life with any of them. She noted also that although there were  in
   place court orders in respect of J and K granting a joint residence order
   and a parental responsibility order  ("PRO")  to  the  appellant  and  Ms
   Shattock-Flynn, the terms of the former are no longer  being  maintained;
   that there was no need for the appellant to  be  present  in  the  United
   Kingdom for the terms of the PRO to be fulfilled; and,  that  the  orders
   would not prevent the appellant's deportation. She considered  also  that
   his removal would not have a significant impact on the children, although
   it was accepted that they visit him in prison.

13. The respondent considered that  Ms  P  would  have  been  aware  of  the
   appellant's status when their relationship commenced. She considered also
   that contact between the appellant and N must necessarily have been  very
   limited, given he has been in custody since N was five months  old;  and,
   that the appellant's removal would not have a significant impact  on  his
   day to day life or well-being.

14. Turning to the consideration of the best interests of the children,  the
   respondent considered that J and K were  no  longer  dependent  on  their
   father; that they now formed  part  of  Ms  H's  new  family  unit  which
   included a British-born sibling; and, that it was in their best interests
   to remain with their mother in the United Kingdom, the  appellant  having
   shown by his conduct that he  had  not  considered  his  children's  best
   interests and was not a suitable role model  for  them  or  for  N.   She
   considered that N's best interests were to remain in the  United  Kingdom
   in his mother's care.

15. The respondent  considered  further  that  the  appellant  had  made  no
   attempt to rehabilitate himself after his first conviction, and that  the
   addition of 28 days on  to  his  sentence  on  account  of  adjudications
   against him suggests he poses a serious risk of re-offending.

16. The appeal against the respondent's decision came before the  First-tier
   Tribunal on 1 November 2013, the panel consisting of First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Herlihy and Mr B Yates. With regard  to  paragraph  398(a)  of  the
   Immigration Rules, they concluded [42] that  there  were  no  exceptional
   circumstances. The panel concluded also [53] that  the  appellant  had  a
   son, R, living in Jamaica with whom he was in contact, and  that  he  had
   not given a truthful account of his family in Jamaica  or  the  level  of
   contact he has with them.

17. The panel considered that it would not be reasonable to expect Ms  P  or
   the appellant's children to leave the United Kingdom [56]  but  concluded
   that the impact on J and K would  not  be  much.   They  concluded  that,
   notwithstanding the children's best interests, it would be  proportionate
   to deport the appellant.

18. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on  the
   grounds that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law by failing:

       i) to make credibility findings [2];
      ii) to make proper assessments of the best interests of the  children
          [6];
     iii) to make a  proper  assessment  of  the  impact  on  them  of  the
          appellant's removal [9];
      iv) to consider if the children would benefit from their father being
          here [10] (Peart [2012] EWCA Civ 568);
       v) to consider properly the impact of  the  appellant's  removal  on
          other family members [14];
      vi) to assess properly the risk of re-offending [17 -22].

   Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds.

19. The appeal then came before the Upper Tribunal on  12  March  2013.  For
   the reasons set out in the annexe to this  determination,  Lord  Turnbull
   and Upper Tribunal Judge McKee found that the determination of the First-
   tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law.  Subsequent to a
   transfer order, this appeal comes before us to remake the determination.

20. The matter came  before  us  on  29  August  2013,  after  a  number  of
   adjournments occasioned by failures by the Probation service  to  produce
   an up-to-date OASYs report.  We are somewhat dismayed that  it  was  only
   after we had indicated in directions to  the  Probation  Service  that  a
   witness summons in the name of the responsible officer would  be  issued,
   that this report was forthcoming.

21. We heard evidence from the appellant,  his  partner  and  his  partner's
   sister, and in addition heard submissions from both representatives.

22. We also had the following documentary evidence before us:

      i) Respondent's bundle ("RB")
     ii) Respondent's caselaw bundle
    iii) Appellant's consolidated bundle ("AB")
     iv) Additional appellant's bundle  ("AB2") containing letters  relating
         to K J and N
      v) Report from London Probation Trust dated 15 July 2013

Oral evidence

1. The appellant adopted his witness statements. He said that he  has  never
   taken illegal drugs,  does  not  smoke  and  rarely  drinks  alcohol.  He
   acknowledged that he has two cautions for  possession  of  cannabis  from
   2001-3, the first occurring when he had said cannabis  belonging  to  his
   then wife belong to him as he did  not  want  her  to  be  taken  to  the
   station.  He  said  that  he  had  undergone  drugs  testing  in  prison,
   regularly, and that this was obligatory before a family visit,  of  which
   there had been 4 or 5, would be permitted. He had never tested  positive.
   The appellant said that he had not been eligible for  a  drugs  awareness
   course as he had not taken drugs, but he had asked to do the course as he
   wanted to know the dangers and more about what they  do  to  people.  The
   appellant said that he had undertaken courses in prison to qualify as  an
   electrician, and that he still has the practical part to do.

2. The appellant said that he had committed his offences in the past  as  he
   had had no money to provide for his children  who  had  needed  food  and
   clothing; and, that if that situation arose again, he would  go  without,
   and would make sure that they lived on what his partner earns.

3. In cross-examination, the appellant said he  could  not  recall  how  the
   second caution for possession of cannabis  arose.  He  confirmed  he  had
   never taken illegal  drugs,  and  had  got  into  the  business  in  2003
   following a friend whom he asked for money and who asked him to  do  work
   for him. He said he had thought of the consequences but went ahead as  he
   was not earning, and had two boys to provide for. He  said  he  had  been
   aware of the effect drugs have, but since being  in  prison  had  learned
   more about it. He said he had not become involved again with drugs  until
   shortly before he had been arrested again. He said he  had  approached  a
   man, Marlon, whom he knew for money. Marlon had asked  him  to  give  his
   address, but had not given the money, and  that  is  how  he  had  become
   involved again with drugs.

4. The appellant said he did not think  his  imprisonment  had  made  him  a
   better role model for his children, but he had not been allowed to work.

5. In response to our questions the appellant said the he was not  rejecting
   the 2009 sentencing judge's  findings  about  his  involvement  with  the
   importation of drugs.

6. We then heard evidence from Ms P, the  appellant's  partner  who  adopted
   her witness statements, adding that the appellant  had  not  appeared  to
   have a lot of money during the time they had lived together. She said  he
   is anti-smoking and anti-drugs. She said also that if released  he  would
   work for her in her business as a part-time driver. The current driver is
   about to leave as he wants to do  the  "knowledge"  and  become  a  taxi-
   driver. The appellant would also  seek  to  finish  his  training  as  an
   electrician. She said that she continues to visit the appellant  once  or
   twice a week, taking N with her; J and K are able  to  come  on  specific
   family visits but not generally as  they  are  either  at  school  or  at
   weekends have football.

7.  Ms P confirmed that N has a close bond with his father, and that N  will
   be starting school in September. She said the  appellant  would  not  re-
   offend as he has help and support from her and her  family  and  will  be
   working.

8. Cross-examined, Ms P said  that  she  knew  the  appellant  had  been  in
   trouble with the police but that was not something she had focussed on at
   the time the relationship had started; although  she  had  known  through
   friends that he had been in prison, she had not known why.   She said the
   appellant had not appeared to have money beyond day to day things.

9. In response to our questions, Ms P said  she  had  started  her  business
   about 10 years ago, and that it was quiet now, profitability varying. She
   said she had not spoken to the appellant about why he had  committed  his
   most recent offences, but thought that it had been  because  he  had  not
   been able to contribute financially to the household.

10. Finally, Ms P's sister gave evidence, adopting her  witness  statements,
   adding that she did not believe the appellant had ever been  a  drug-user
   and had often in the past objected to her and her  husband  smoking.  She
   did not think he had ever taken, for example, cannabis or cocaine.

Submissions

11. Mr Avery submitted  that  deporting  the  appellant  was  proportionate,
   given his appalling immigration history and offending, and  that  he  now
   seemed to be trying to minimise his involvement with the  index  offence.
   He submitted that the OASys report is a little inaccurate, and  had  been
   prepared by someone not familiar with  the  appellant's  background,  and
   appeared not to reflect the appellant's current  plans  on  release.   He
   submitted that, in any event, a finding that the  appellant  was  at  low
   risk of re-offending was not a matter to  which  much  weight  should  be
   attached, given the great weight to be attached to the public interest in
   deporting him.  Mr Avery conceded that it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
   expect the children to relocate, but did not accept that it was in  their
   best interests that the appellant be permitted to remain here.

12. Mr Bazini accepted that this was  a  case  which  was  finely  balanced,
   submitting that it was in the children's best interests, given the  close
   bond they have with their father,  that  he  be  allowed  to  remain.  He
   submitted that although  the  appellant's  offending  was  unquestionably
   serious, that was not, on the particular facts of this case sufficient to
   justify deportation.

13. Mr Bazini  submitted  that  in  this  case  the  motivation  behind  the
   appellant's offending had been to provide for  his  children,  indicating
   the strength of the bond, and that he has the support of his partner, his
   ex-wife and his partner's family all of whom confirmed  the  strength  of
   his good relationships with is children. He drew  our  attention  to  the
   sentencing remarks of HHJ Worsley indicating that the appellant is a good
   man, and, to the numerous visits the appellant's sons had made to him.

14. Mr Bazini submitted that deporting the appellant would  effectively  end
   the close bonds the appellant has with  his  children,  and  bring  their
   family life to an end. He submitted that the offences committed here were
   not at the level of seriousness in N(Kenya) and that it was open to us to
   allow the appeal, there being no special reason why drug offences  should
   require deportation.

15. Mr Bazini also submitted that it is particularly important in this  case
   to take into account the special bond between a father and son, directing
   us to Peart, and that as there, the whole extended family  will  be  torn
   apart.  He submitted also that, contrary to the respondent's  submission,
   it is in the best interests of the children that the appellant be allowed
   to remain, given that he was at low risk of re-offending.

Findings

16. As is noted above, this  appellant  has  already  been  the  subject  of
   deportation proceedings and his appeal against the respondent's  decision
   to deport  him  made  in  2005,  was  unsuccessful.   While  the  factual
   situation considered in those proceedings  has  clearly  changed,  it  is
   nonetheless useful to bear the earlier decisions in mind  as  a  starting
   point and that it had been held proportionate to  deport  the  appellant.
   In December 2007, after hearing the appellant who was by then  acting  in
   person, in refusing permission to appeal Sedley LJ  observed  (apparently
   in the belief that the appellant was at that point cohabiting with Lesley
   Shattock-Flynn and they  were jointly applying for a residence  order  in
   respect of J and K), as follows[RB, K5]:

         11. Dealing with it, however, as I must on the facts known  to  the
         Immigration Judge, I am driven to agree with  Hooper  LJ,  that  Mr
         Edwards's history of repeated cheating of the  immigration  system,
         without which he would not have been here at all, his ready  resort
         to fraud when it suited him. His commission of  a  series  of  drug
         offences which even with mitigation earned him  almost  four  years
         imprisonment, added up to a formidable  case  for  deportation.  To
         render  deportation  in  such  circumstances   a   disproportionate
         invasion of his Article 8 rights to respect for  his  family  life,
         something more solid  than  his  then  current  relationships  with
         Lesley and his two sons had to be shown. Tempting as it is  to  use
         hindsight, I am not able any more than the AIT was to do that.

17. That is, of course, a strong indicator  that  the  appellant  might,  at
   that stage, have had a considerably stronger case than at  the  time  the
   decision to deport him was made. There have of  course  since  then  been
   changes in the appellant's circumstances  both  adverse  in  terms  of  a
   subsequent  conviction,  and  positive,   in   terms   of   relationships
   strengthened and developed.

18. In assessing the factual background to this  case,  although  we  accept
   that were there some discrepancies in the appellant's evidence,  we  note
   that these relate to the contact he has with family in Jamaica.  We  have
   not heard submissions on this.

19. The  starting  point  for  our  consideration  in  this  appeal  is  the
   Immigration Rules. Mr Bazini candidly accepted that there was nothing  he
   could submit in support of the proposition  that  the  appeal  should  be
   allowed under the immigration rules.  The appellant has been sentenced to
   a term of imprisonment in excess of 4 years, and there is nothing in  the
   case before us which persuades us  that  he  meets  the  requirements  of
   paragraph 398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules  and  so  we  dismiss  the
   appeal under the Immigration Rules.

20. We therefore turn, in the light of MF (Article 8 -  new  rules)  Nigeria
   [2012] UKUT 393 (IAC), Ogundimu (Article 8 - new  rules)  Nigeria  [2013]
   UKUT 60 (IAC) and Izuazu Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045  (IAC),
   to the learning in respect of article 8. In turning to that, we  bear  in
   mind the questions set out  by  Lord  Bingham  at  paragraph  17  of  the
   opinions in Razgar.   We bear in mind also the decisions in  �ner  v  The
   Netherlands (2007) 45 EHRR 14 ("�ner") and Maslov [2009] INLR  47  which,
   with other  cases,  were   summarised  in  Masih  (deportation  -  public
   interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046(IAC) at paragraph
   11:


    11. In our view those basic principles, on the public interest  side  of
        the balancing  exercise,  are  as  follows;  we  have  set  out  the
        authorities on which they are based in foot-notes, to make it  clear
        that there is no need for further reference to them by panels:


       (a)    In a case of automatic deportation[1], full  account  must  be
          taken of the strong public interest in removing  foreign  citizens
          convicted  of  serious  offences,  which  lies  not  only  in  the
          prevention of further offences  on  the  part  of  the  individual
          concerned, but in deterring others from  committing  them  in  the
          first place[2];

       (b)     Deportation  of   foreign   criminals   expresses   society's
          condemnation of serious  criminal  activity  and  promotes  public
          confidence in the treatment of foreign citizens who have committed
          them[3];

       (c)  The starting-point for assessing the facts  of  the  offence  of
          which an individual  has  been  committed,  and  their  effect  on
          others, and on the public as a whole, must be the  view  taken  by
          the sentencing judge[4];

       (d)    The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis of the  situation
          at the date of the hearing;

       (e)    Full account should also be taken of  any  developments  since
          sentence was passed, for example the result  of  any  disciplinary
          adjudications in prison or detention,  or  any  OASys  or  licence
          report;

       (f)         In considering the relevant facts on 'private and  family
          life' under article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights,
          "for a settled migrant[5] who has lawfully spent all or the major
          part of his or her childhood and youth  in  [this]  country,  very
          serious reasons are required to justify expulsion"[6];

         (g)  Such serious reasons are needed "all the  more  so  where  the
          person  concerned   committed   the   relevant   offences   as   a
          juvenile" [7]; but "very serious  violent  offences  can  justify
          expulsion even if they were committed by a minor"[8] . Other very
          serious offending may also have this consequence.

23. We accept that the burden is on the Secretary of State  to  demonstrate
    that her actions are proportionate, but the balancing exercise can only
    be undertaken once facts are established. As a general principle, it is
    for the person asserting the fact to prove it; we find nothing  in  the
    submissions made to us to persuade us to the contrary and this approach
    is consistent with Razgar.

21. We accept the history of the appellant's relationships and  immigration
    history as set out in the witness statements before us. We accept  that
    he is the father of J, K and N.  We  accept  also  the  J  and  K  have
    continued to have contact with him, as shown  by  the  prison  visiting
    records, and also from the letters they have written in support [AB 15,
    17].

22. J states in his letter that it became harder for him as he grew up  not
    to have his father there to watch him play  football,  see  how  he  is
    progressing and that was hard when his father was taken away.  He  also
    says that he tries to go to see him when  he  can;  that  it  would  be
    difficult for him to visit him if he were in Jamaica, and that  he  had
    always thought that he would be coming home.

23. In his letter [AB17], K says that he misses  his  father,  and  regrets
    that he is not able to come to see him play football, and does not want
    his father to go back to Jamaica as he would never see  him  again.  He
    too had thought that his father would be coming  home,  and  is  scared
    that if he goes to Jamaica, he would never see him again.

24. The boys' mother says in her statement [AB14] that J and K  miss  their
    father, that he had been a good father to them, and loves them  a  lot;
    that they were heartbroken when the appellant was taken to prison; that
    they are struggling without him and that it is important that  as  they
    grow older that they have a father to support and advise them.   It  is
    also said that they are too young to go to Jamaica to visit him.

25. We have no reason to doubt the sincerity of this  evidence.  We  accept
    that, despite the difficulties, and their relatively young age, J and K
    have travelled on a regular  basis  to  see  their  father  in  prison,
    including when he was in HMP Dartmoor. They have continued to do so for
    a number of years.  That  is  indicative  of  the  closeness  of  their
    relationship, which is confirmed by the evidence of Ms P  and  also  by
    the letter from their mother [AB 15].

26. We are satisfied, given the  closeness  of  the  relationship,  that  a
    family life exists between the appellant and J and K.

27. There is, understandably, no evidence from N given his age, but  we  do
    note that he and his mother have visited the  appellant  on  a  regular
    basis. That continues once or twice a week, with  family  visits  where
    the appellant can play with N being less frequent. The evidence in  AB2
    from the relevant officials confirms the closeness of the bond with the
    appellant.

28. It is not suggested that there is a  family  relationship  between  the
    appellant and any of his former partners, although we accept  there  is
    some contact with Ms H incidental to the children, J and K.  We  accept
    that there is a strong, family relationship between the  appellant  and
    his partner, Ms P.

29. We accept that the appellant has a private life in this  country  which
    includes his partner's family, and the acquaintances and friendships he
    has developed here since his arrival. We accept  also  that  he  has  a
    prospect  of  employment  on  release,  and   has   usefully   acquired
    qualifications which will lead to him qualifying as an electrician.

30. In the circumstances, we accept that the first four questions  set  out
    in Razgar fall to be answered in the affirmative, and we therefore turn
    to the issue of proportionality. We have also  considered  and  applied
    the principles set out in the decisions of the Court  of  Appeal  in  N
    (Kenya) [2004] EWCA Civ 1094, OH Serbia [2008]  EWCA  Civ  694  and  RU
    (Bangladesh) [2011] EWCA Civ 651; weighing in the balance the  need  to
    deter foreign nationals from committing serious crimes by leading  them
    to understand that, whatever the other  circumstances  one  consequence
    for them may well be deportation. We have further placed in the balance
    the role of a deportation order as an expression of society's revulsion
    at serious crimes and in building public confidence in the treatment of
    foreign citizens who have committed serious crimes.

31. The best interests of the children are a primary consideration  and  we
    have treated them as such.  We are persuaded  that,  in  light  of  the
    findings above, given the closeness to their father, and the continuing
    support they get from him, that it would be in their best interests for
    that to continue. We are not persuaded, despite Mr Avery's submissions,
    that the appellant's offending is such that it  would  not  be  in  the
    children's best interests for them to remain in contact  with  him.  We
    note that no evidence to that effect has been submitted,  and  that  on
    the contrary, the weight of the evidence is that  the  appellant  is  a
    good father, and that his sons look up to him. We note in  this  regard
    the positive evidence from Ms P and her  family,  and  from  the  older
    boys' mother, Ms H. We observe also that there is no indication in  any
    of the sentencing remarks or probation reports that the appellant is  a
    risk to his children.

32. We accept that they cannot be expected to go to live  in  Jamaica,  and
    that in the case of J and K that they will  want  to  maintain  contact
    with him. We are persuaded also that, as they grow up,  it  may  be  of
    benefit to them to have continuing contact with their father. It is not
    realistic to consider that this could be maintained at  a  distance  by
    electronic means, and any visits are likely to be infrequent and short.



33. It is in the children's  best  interests  that  the  appellant  is  not
    deported, and we accept that his deportation is likely  permanently  to
    sever the family life that exists.  That  said,  we  note  that  for  a
    substantial time now, the children's relationship with their father has
    been severely constrained by his imprisonment, and thus the family life
    that exists between them  is  not  one  characterised  by  them  living
    together, or by extended periods of time spent together, or  the  daily
    interaction between a parent and child. We do however accept that  were
    the appellant freed, that  this  type  of  relationship  would  be  re-
    established.

34.  The  most  recent  OASys  report  is  not  without  its  difficulties,
    highlighted by both representatives. We bear in mind it was prepared by
    someone who was less familiar with the case, and without  some  of  the
    relevant  papers.  This  may  have  led  to  the  comments  about   the
    appellant's drug taking. We accept, in the light of  the  evidence  led
    before us, that the appellant has not taken illegal drugs.   We  accept
    also that he will have a steady home life with his partner and  son  to
    return to; that he will have the support of his partner's family;  that
    he has a realistic prospect of employment as a driver in his  partner's
    business; and, that he has a realistic prospect  of  qualifying  as  an
    electrician, an occupation which would most  likely  provide  a  steady
    income.  Bearing these positive factors in mind, we consider  that  the
    favourable conclusion that the appellant is of low risk of re-offending
    is if anything strengthened, and that this balances the omission of any
    less favourable factors.

35. The appellant has, as we noted above, been supported for  a  number  of
    years by his partner, Ms P, who has shown her  commitment  to  him  and
    their life together by her unstinting visits to him over several years.
    That said, we bear  in  mind  that  the  relationship  began  when  the
    appellant had already  committed  a  serious  offence  and  was  facing
    deportation. The decision to cohabit was taken when it would have  been
    apparent that the appellant's position in  this  country  was  at  best
    precarious given that his presence here was illegal  even  without  the
    threat of deportation hanging over him.  That is a factor we take  into
    account.

36. The appellant's low risk of re-offending is a factor in his  favour  but
   is not determinative. In this case we bear in mind that he has  committed
   two very serious crimes involving Class A  drugs.   We  observe  that  in
   OH (Serbia)  Wilson LJ summarised the relevant principles as follows at
   paragraph 15:

     a) The risk of reoffending is one facet of the public interest but, in
        the case of very serious crimes, not the most important facet.


     b) Another important facet is the need to deter foreign nationals from
        committing serious crimes  by  leading  them  to  understand  that,
        whatever the other circumstances, one consequence of them may  well
        be deportation.


     c) A further important facet is the role of a deportation order as  an
        expression of society's revulsion at serious crimes and in building
        public confidence in the treatment of  foreign  citizens  who  have
        committed serious crimes.


     d)  Primary responsibility for the public interest, whose view  of  it
        is likely to be wider and better informed than that of a  tribunal,
        resides in the respondent and accordingly  a  tribunal  hearing  an
        appeal against a decision to deport should not  only  consider  for
        itself all the facets of the public interest but should weigh, as a
        linked but independent feature, the approach to them adopted by the
        respondent in the context of the facts of the  case.  Speaking  for
        myself, I would not however describe the tribunal's  duty  in  this
        regard as being higher than 'to weigh' this feature."


24. The seriousness of the offences can be  gauged  from  His  Honour  Judge
   Worsley's sentencing remarks on 2 June 2009:-

       Roy Edwards, you pleaded guilty to  being  involved  the  fraudulent
       importation of 483 grams of powder containing just under  400  grams
       of pure cocaine. A postal importation from Costa  Rica.  As  I  have
       said, following a Newton Hearing just now I am sure  that  you  were
       involved in the organisation of it including in the sending  of  the
       money at the beginning  of  December;  some  �1700  not  necessarily
       however involved on your own. There may well have been  others.  You
       were very closely involved in the collection that you went to  take.
       That part at least you admitted.


       What makes it particularly serious and what is an aggravating factor
       is that in 2003 6 years ago for six offences of  supplying  in  this
       country Class A  drugs  you  had  to  be  sentenced  to  45  months'
       imprisonment. That makes your decision to have  done  this  all  the
       more wicked. Apart from this drug dealing, you seem a decent man, 40
       years old, with a number of children to whom you are a good  father.
       But as you know only a substantial prison sentence is possible.  Not
       a day goes past in this court without us seeing the  misery  or  the
       victims of  crime  and  the  addict,  defendants  whose  lives  were
       destroyed by the pernicious trading cocaine and its derivative crack
       cocaine.


       You have credit for having pleaded guilty, but only some credit.  It
       was not a plea of guilty at the plea and case management hearing but
       was followed certainly to your solicitors within a month thereafter.
       That is to some extent undermined by you having maintained  a  false
       basis of plea which as I have found I  am  quite  sure  was  untrue,
       saying you  were  just  collecting  the  parcel  and  had  no  other
       involvement in doing it at the behest  of  somebody  else.  That  is
       quite untrue.


       The sentence on Count 1 is 6.5 years' imprisonment.  It  would  have
       been eight but for your plea and the credit which I  can  give  you,
       though as I say I have to regard to the Newton basis you wrongly put
       forward. For Count 2, the passport offence with intent  to  use  the
       passport - a serious offence in itself - there must be a sentence of
       six months. It would normally be more but I have to have  regard  to
       the totality.


       The 6 months in itself would have been 9 months had you not  pleaded
       guilty at the first opportunity which you did. So the total  is  6.5
       years plus 6  months  consecutive  as  it  must  be.  The  total  is
       therefore 7 years' imprisonment. I direct under section 240 that you
       full credit to all the time of your remand in custody which I record
       I believe to be 109 days. But should that be inaccurate  it  can  be
       corrected  administratively.  It  is  not  for  me   to   make   any
       recommendation in relation to immigration matters  as  the  sentence
       well exceeds one year. The immigration authorities  will  decide  it
       themselves.


25. We consider also that factors (b) and (c) identified in OH (Serbia)  are
   of considerable importance here, not least because of the seriousness  of
   the most recent offences, and the effect on the public as a whole. We are
   concerned also that the appellant in his evidence  before  us  sought  to
   diminish his involvement in the offence, contrary to HHJ's findings after
   a Newton hearing.  This, we find, is indicative of a lack of  remorse  on
   his part, and while we note the appellant now says he realises the effect
   of drugs on society, there is little evidence that this has lead  him  to
   identify with the victims of the pernicious trade in illegal  drugs,  the
   suffering of those who are addicted, or of  the  damage  they  and  their
   families undergo.

26. We consider that the seriousness of the offences and the  need  to  mark
   society's revulsion at serious crimes  weigh  significantly  against  the
   respondent. Further, the offences were committed when the  Appellant  had
   already been convicted of  a  serious  offence  for  which  he  had  been
   sentenced to 45 months' imprisonment and when he  had  already  lost  his
   appeal against conviction. We consider that this,  his  poor  immigration
   history, and the possession of a false passport demonstrate  a  disregard
   for the laws of this country.

27. It is very  ably  put  by  Mr  Bazini  that  the  reason  the  appellant
   committed the offences was to provide for his family. Certainly, there is
   no evidence before us that the appellant himself benefited financially to
   any significant degree, but it is worrying  that  the  appellant,  having
   been convicted of a serious offence in  connection  with  the  supply  of
   class A drugs, should repeat his  offending  when  faced  with  the  same
   situation. We accept that the appellant was not allowed to work but  that
   does not excuse his choice on two occasions to become involved  in  trade
   in drugs.

28. That said, we bear in mind the positive observations in  the  sentencing
   remarks. It is not in doubt that the appellant is a good father who  has,
   despite his imprisonment, been able to maintain  a  good  and  supportive
   relationship with his sons, against the odds.

29. We accept that, as was eloquently submitted  by  Mr  Bazini,  the  stark
   reality here is that deporting the appellant will sever the  relationship
   and the family life that exists between the appellant and his  sons,  and
   between the appellant and his partner. The effect will, we have no doubt,
   be profound both on them, and on those close to  them,  although  we  not
   that there is no medical or other expert evidence to suggest any  lasting
   psychological  impact  or  any  significant  impact  on  the   children's
   education or development.

30. It is for the respondent to show that this  decision  is  proportionate,
   relying as she properly does on the public interest in deporting  foreign
   nationals who have committed serious crimes.  That, we find, is a  matter
   to which significant weight is attached, all the more so where, as  here,
   there is a history of the appellant being sentenced to a lengthy term  of
   imprisonment resulting in deportation proceedings, and him  going  on  to
   commit an even more serious crime. In this case, there is  a  significant
   public interest in deportation as  an  expression  of  revulsion  in  the
   commission of  such  crimes;  and,  building  public  confidence  in  the
   treatment  of  foreign  nationals  who  have  committed  serious  crimes,
   particularly when they go on to commit further offences.

31. We find that on the facts  of  this  case,  bearing  in  mind  the  very
   serious nature of the offences committed, the second  occurring  after  a
   decision to deport the appellant, that deportation of  the  appellant  is
   proportionate, even bearing in mind the low risk of reoffending  and  the
   strong family and private life the appellant has developed here, with the
   consequence that his family ties  with  his  partner  and  sons  will  be
   permanently                                                      severed.




   Conclusions


1. We find that the determination of the  First-Tier  Tribunal  did  involve
   the making of an error of law, and we set it aside.

2. We remake the decision, dismissing the appeal on all grounds.

3. The parties are reminded  of  the  anonymity  order  in  respect  of  the
   appellant's minor children.
