                            DECISION AND REASONS






BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL
1.   The Appellant is a national of  India.  He  first  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 25 September 2007, as a student. His leave was  subsequently
    granted leave as a Tier 1 (Highly Skilled) Post-study worker and a Tier
    1 (Highly Skilled) General Migrant until 15 April  2016.  On  13  April
    2016 the Appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain as a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant. He varied this application  to  one  for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis of long residence on 14 November 2017.

2.   The Appellant's application was refused on 5 March  2019  and,  as  his
    last application was deemed to be a human rights claim on private  life
    grounds, he was able to appeal against this decision on 19 March 2019.

3.   Upper Tribunal Judge Martin, sitting as a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal in a decision promulgated on  17  July
    2019. The Appellant appealed against this decision and  Resident  Judge
    Phillips granted him permission to appeal on 20 September 2019.

PRELIMINARY POINT
4.   At the start of the hearing, counsel for the Appellant  explained  that
    the Appellant's wife had made a separate appeal as  his  dependent  and
    that her appeal had been dismissed. She had applied for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, but no decision had yet been  reached  on
    her application. He asked for the two appeals  to  be  consolidated.  I
    explained that the only matter before me to do was  the  error  of  law
    hearing in relation to the Appellant, but that if I did find that there
    had been an error of law, I would take steps to see if the two  appeals
    could be consolidated.

5.    I   made   enquiries   about   the   Appellant's   wife's   case   (ZA
    (HU/08221/2019). It was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Malik in
    a decision promulgated on 22 October 2019. Her  subsequent  application
    to the First-tier Tribunal  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was only logged in on 8  November  2019  and  has  yet  to  be
    allocated to a First-tier Tribunal Judge  for  a  decision.  Therefore,
    there is no application  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  it  is  not
    procedurally possible for me to join it with  the  Appellant's  appeal.
    It would be appropriate to forward  this  decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal with a request that it is put before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge considering the Appellant's wife's application for permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING
6.   Counsel for the Appellant and the Home Office Presenting  Officer  both
    made oral submissions and I have taken these into account when reaching
    my findings below.  In particular, the Home Office  Presenting  Officer
    did not rely on the Rule 24 Response  and  conceded  that  the  grounds
    relating to how the Judge approached the evidence had  some  force  and
    suggested that she had made errors of law in her decision.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION
7.   The Appellant had made a human rights  claim  but  a  consideration  of
    whether he could qualify for leave  to  remain  under  the  Immigration
    Rules was a pre-condition to  the  necessary  proportionality  exercise
    under Article 8(2) of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  The
    Appellant could not qualify for indefinite leave to remain  if  one  of
    the general rules for refusal applied to him. In particular,  paragraph
    322 of the Immigration Rules states:

     "In addition to the grounds for refusal of extension of  stay  set  out
    in Parts 2-8 of these Rules, the following provisions apply in relation
    to the refusal of an application for  leave  to  remain,  variation  of
    leave to enter or remain...
     (5) the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain  in
    the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct  (including  convictions
    which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C), character  or  associations
    or the fact that he represents a threat to national security".

8.   In her refusal letter, the  Respondent  found  that  paragraph  322(1C)
    applied as the information provided to her when the  Appellant  applied
    for leave to remain as a Tier 1 Highly Skilled (General) Migrant on  26
    February 2011 differed from the information provided to  HMRC  when  he
    made his tax returns for the years ending 5  April  2010  and  5  April
    2011.

9.   The witness statement by the  officer  from  HMRC,  dated  28  February
    2019, confirmed that the Appellant's tax return for the year  ending  5
    April 2010, which was submitted on 28 January 2011, showed that he  had
    declared a PAYE income of �9,415 and a self-employed income of �901. It
    also confirmed that his tax return for the year ending  5  April  2011,
    which was submitted on 30 April 2012, showed a PAYE income of �282  and
    a self-employed income of �8187.

10.  In relation to the first ground of  appeal,  in  paragraph  48  of  her
    decision, Upper Tribunal Judge Martin, sitting as a First-tier Tribunal
    Judge, found that:

      "The  responsibility  for  the  filing  of  tax  returns,  whether  an
    accountant is employed or not, rests with the person  concerned.  I  do
    not accept that it [is] credible that the appellant would not have been
    surprised at his having to pay no tax given the amount  of  his  actual
    earnings".

11.  However, there was evidence before the  Judge  which  showed  that  the
    Appellant had paid �308.80 in tax for the year ending 5 April 2011.

12.  Therefore, the Judge made a clear factual error in paragraph 48 of  her
    decision.

13.  In relation  to  third  ground  of  appeal,  in  paragraph  45  of  her
    decision, the Judge found that "it is simply not credible that a person
    who has been engaged working in the financial sector and  has  been  in
    the UK for 10 years would be as ignorant of the UK tax  systems  as  he
    claims". However, Upper Tribunal  Judge  Martin  failed  to  take  into
    account the fact that the Appellant first entered the United Kingdom on
    25 September 2007 and did not start working for  Santander  Bank  until
    November 2014. In addition, the evidence, in the form of his tax return
    for 2010/2011, indicates that at that time  he  was  working  as  self-
    employed sales and management consultant.

14.  Therefore, the starting point for the Judge's findings in  relation  to
    the Appellant's credibility  in  paragraph  43  of  her  decision  were
    undermined by her assumption that he had  worked  in  the  banking  and
    financial  sector  at  the   time   he   had   instructed   his   book-
    keeper/accountant to make his first two tax returns.

15.   In  addition,  in  relation  to  ground  four,  when  the  Judge   was
    considering the circumstances surrounding the Appellant's first two tax
    returns,  she  failed  to  consider  the  explanation  given   by   the
    Appellant's current accountants,  Medina  Accountants,  about  how  the
    earlier errors in his tax returns had occurred.  In their letter,  they
    explained that they had reviewed his tax return for 2010-2011  and  had
    identified  that  errors  had  been  made   by   his   previous   book-
    keeper/accountant. They had  also  drawn  up  a  table  in  which  they
    identified the expenses which his previous  book-keeper/accountant  had
    wrongly believed to be allowable against tax,  in  the  form  of  rent,
    food, BB and utilities. They also noted that the  costs  of  a  mobile,
    personal use of fuel and car repairs, washing and  insurance  had  also
    been claimed as expenses but were not fully allowable. The  table  also
    showed that if the non-allowable expenses were deducted the Appellant's
    net profit was �8187, which is the net profit given in his  tax  return
    for 2010/2011.

16.  Upper Tribunal Judge Martin also failed to take into account  the  fact
    that the Appellant had submitted a  copy  of  his  unaudited  accounts,
    dated 10 February 2011, which confirmed an operating profit of  �37,440
    and provided a sales summary for the previous year for the gross amount
    of �39,792.66. This was the figure for  sales  referred  to  by  Medina
    Accountants  in  their  table  indicating  the  errors  made   by   the
    Appellant's previous book-keeper/accountant.

17.  These unaudited accounts were relied upon by the Respondent, as can  be
    seen from the caseworker's notes contained in the Respondent's  Bundle.
    In  addition,  I  accept  that  HMRC   would   have   relied   on   his
    bookkeeper/accountant to calculate his allowable expenses accurately.

18.  The  evidence  before  the  Judge  arguably  amounted  to  an  innocent
    explanation for him not realising that his early tax  returns  had  not
    been accurate.

 19. For these reasons, there were material errors of  law  in  the  Judge's
    decision.

20.  Therefore, it was  not  necessary  to  explore  the  Appellant's  first
    ground of appeal which was much weaker and depended upon an  unreported
    decision of the Upper Tribunal. Counsel for the Appellant also accepted
    that this ground would not be determinative in relation to the question
    of              the               Appellant's               credibility























DECISION
 (1) The Appellant's appeal is granted.

(2)  Upper Tribunal Judge Martin's decision is set aside.

REMAKING
1.   I adopt my findings above which indicate that the Appellant  would  not
    have been  aware  that  his  bookkeeper/accountant,  Financial  Service
    Partners, at the relevant time had miscalculated the expenses which  he
    could claim against his tax liability as a self-employed person. He had
    only just entered into self-employment and was not at  that  time  even
    working in a bank.

2.   The evidence provided by his present accountants,  Medina  Accountants,
    gave a detailed explanation  of  the  mistakes  made  by  his  previous
    accountants.

3.   In paragraph 51 of her decision, Upper Tribunal Judge  Martin,  sitting
    as a First-tier Tribunal Judge, also noted that:

     "Apart from the appellant's assertions I have no evidence  either  from
    his former accountants or ACCA to indicate that the error was  that  of
    the accountant. I acknowledge the firm concerned no longer exists,  but
    its  proprietor  remains  commercially  active  and  could  have   been
    contacted. The appellant chose not to seek him out and I have only  his
    assertion that he made any enquiries at all".

4.   The Appellant has now been  able  to  trace  this  proprietor  and  the
    Appellant has made a Rule  15(2A)  application  to  provide  the  Upper
    Tribunal with evidence which was not  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    when it reached its decision.

5.   I have considered this evidence and find that by its nature it is  very
    relevant to the issue in question and  could  not  have  been  produced
    before the First-tier Tribunal. Therefore, I find that  it  is  in  the
    interests of justice to admit it into evidence for the purpose of  this
    re-hearing.

6     The email trail contained in the  bundle  indicates  the  difficulties
    the Appellant faced when tracing a person who is now  practicing  in  a
    different jurisdiction. The evidence shows that the Appellant tried  to
    contact the man who completed his tax returns  by  Facebook  and  email
    without any success but that he  then  obtained  his  new  professional
    email through a friend.

7.   Eventually in an email, dated  18  October  2019,  Pratik  Modi  looked
    through the Appellant's accounts and statements and  accepted  that  he
    had made errors when filling in the Appellant's returns.

8.   In addition, there were emails which confirmed that the  Appellant  has
    now made a formal complaint about Pratik Modi to the ACCA and that this
    complaint had been acknowledged.

9.   Taking  the  totality  of  the  evidence  into  account,  I  find  that
    paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules  does  not  apply,  as  the
    evidence does not indicate that the Appellant's conduct  and  character
    in relation to his tax returns for the years ending on 5 April 2010 and
    2011 and his application to the  Respondent,  dated  26  February  2011
    showed that it was undesirable to permit him to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

10.  In her refusal letter, dated 5  March  2019,  the  only  other  reasons
    given for refusing to grant the Appellant indefinite  leave  to  remain
    was that he did not meet the requirements  of  paragraphs  27B(ii)  and
    (iii) of the Immigration Rules.

11.  For the reasons given above, I also do not find that  these  paragraphs
    apply to the Appellant, as  there  are  no  reasons  why  it  would  be
    undesirable for him to be given  indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the
    ground of long residence and he does not fall  for  refusal  under  the
    general grounds for refusal.

12.  The Respondent did not dispute that  the  Appellant  had  been  living,
    studying and then working in the  United  Kingdom  since  25  September
    2007. Therefore, he had clearly established a private life here for the
    purposes of Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

13.  When considering whether breaching his right to  continue  to  enjoy  a
    private life here is proportionate for the purposes of Article 8(2)  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights, the fact that he  is  entitled
    to indefinite leave to remain under the Immigration Rules is  a  factor
    which clearly indicates that it was be  a  disproportionate  breach  of
    Article 8 to refuse to grant him leave to remain.

14.  For all of these reasons, I allow the Appellant's appeal.

Decision
(1)  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
