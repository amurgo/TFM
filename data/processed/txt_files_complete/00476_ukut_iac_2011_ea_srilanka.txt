1.  The Immigration Rules make no provision for the admission of  fianc�(e)s
of refugees who are in the United Kingdom with limited leave. In  FH  (Post-
flight spouses) Iran [2010] UKUT 275 (IAC), the Upper  Tribunal  found  that
the spouse of a refugee with limited leave was  in  an  unjustifiably  worse
position  than  the  spouses  of  students,  businessmen  etc,   where   the
immigration rules make provision for a spouse to enter with  limited  leave.
Unlike such persons, the refugee could not  return  home  to  enjoy  married
life there.

2.  By the same token, a refugee cannot return home in order  to  marry  the
fianc�(e) and it may be unreasonable to expect the  couple  to  marry  in  a
third country. Where that is the case, and where  all  the  requirements  of
paragraph 290 of the rules are met, save that relating to settlement, it  is
unlikely that it will be  proportionate  to  refuse  the  admission  of  the
fianc�(e).


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

    1.  The  appellant  appeals  the  determination  of  Immigration  Judge
       Kanagaratnam issued on 29 December 2010, when Mr Martin appeared for
       the respondent before the First-tier Tribunal and the appellant  was
       unrepresented, in which the Immigration Judge  allowed  the  appeal,
       finding that the respondent before the First-tier Tribunal had shown
       to the balance of probabilities that the requirements of  the  rules
       had been met, albeit that was not  a 'live' issue for him to  decide
       as the ambit of the appeal was limited  to  human  rights  and  race
       relations  under  section  84(1)(b)  and  (c)  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 given that this  was  not  a  family
       visit. He also decided that because the appeal had  succeeded  under
       the  immigration  rules  the  decision  to  exclude   breached   the
       appellant's human rights under Article 8 ECHR (paragraph  6  of  the
       determination).

    2. The respondent a citizen of Sri Lanka whose date of birth  is  given
       as 17 September 1973, appealed the decision of the appellant made on
       1 July 2010 to refuse, without interview, leave to enter the  United
       Kingdom ("UK") as a Marriage Visitor in order to marry  her  fianc�,
       Ranjith Gunathilake, also a Sri Lankan national, who  is  recognised
       as a refugee in the United Kingdom ("UK") where he has limited leave
       to remain until 2013.


    3. The respondent lodged a marriage visitor application form on 16 June
       2010 and that was considered, without interview, under paragraphs 41
       and 56D of the Immigration Rules HC395. However, it  was  stated  on
       the front of the form that she intended to stay permanently  in  the
       UK. The appellant ECO therefore took the view  that  she  could  not
       meet the provisions of  paragraph  41(i)  which  requires  that  she
       intend to visit the UK for a maximum stay of six months.

    4. The respondent's fianc�, as indicated, is a refugee in  the  UK  and
       has only limited leave to remain  in  the  UK  until  2013.  As  the
       respondent was not already married to her fianc� before he fled  Sri
       Lanka in 2000, she cannot qualify for  entry  under  paragraph  352A
       which is relevant to so-called 'pre-flight spouses' of refugees.

    5. The  appellant  takes  the  view  that  the  Immigration  Rules  are
       compliant with the Human Rights Act  1998  and  that  excluding  the
       appellant from the UK is justified and a proportionate  exercise  of
       immigration control.

    6. It is noted that the respondent relies on Article 12 ECHR, the right
       to marry and found a family. The appellant takes the view that there
       is no apparent reason why the respondent and her  fianc�  cannot  be
       expected to travel to a third country in  order  to  marry,  and  is
       therefore satisfied that the decision to  exclude  does  not  breach
       Article 12 ECHR.

    7. The appellant makes no mention of  Article  8  ECHR,  the  right  to
       respect for private and family life, in the notice of decision dated
       1 July 2010.

    8. As the visit application was not in respect  of  a  proposed  family
       visit to a person qualifying under the Immigration  Appeals  (Family
       Visitor) Regulations  2003,  the  appellant's  right  of  appeal  is
       limited to those grounds referred to in section 84(1) (b) and (c) of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, that is on grounds
       of discrimination by a public authority and/or human rights grounds.

    9. The respondent appealed on human rights grounds pursuant to Articles
       8 and 12 ECHR.

   10. The Entry Clearance Manager Review is dated 8  September  2010.  The
       Entry Clearance Manager ("ECM") noted that the grounds of appeal  do
       rely on Article 8 as well as article 12 ECHR. It was said  that  the
       respondent had made an honest mistake in ticking the box  that  said
       that she wished to  remain  in  the  UK  permanently.  However,  the
       respondent's solicitors had stated in their letter of 26 March  2010
       that 'both the sponsor and the respondent intended to live  together
       in the UK.' Therefore, the ECM maintained that the decision made was
       fair.

   11. Moving to consider Article 8,  the  ECM  noted  that  the  right  to
       respect  for  private  and  family  life  is   a   qualified   right
       proportionate with the need to maintain an effective immigration and
       border control (my italics), and that decisions under the rules  are
       deemed to be compliant with human rights legislation(my italics).

   12. The ECM adds that no satisfactory reason has been put forward as  to
       why the respondent's fianc� in the UK is unable to travel  elsewhere
       to be with the respondent and she is therefore  satisfied  that  the
       decision  is  justified  by  the  need  to  maintain  an   effective
       immigration and border control. Further, she states,  'there  is  no
       room for discretion and the ECO has followed and applied  the  rules
       accordingly.'

   13. The ECO sought permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  In
       summary, the grounds are that the Immigration Judge erred in law  in
       allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  because   the
       respondent's fianc� has only limited leave to remain in  the  UK  as
       opposed to being settled in the UK.

   14. It is accepted in the grounds that it was open  to  the  Immigration
       Judge to decide the appeal pursuant to  Article  8  ECHR,  with  the
       guidance in the case of FH (Post-flight spouses)  Iran  [2010]  UKUT
       275 (IAC) in mind.

   15. However, it is argued that no proper assessment  of  Article  8  has
       been made and the immigration judge has  given  wholly  insufficient
       reasons for allowing the appeal on this ground. Further, that FH  is
       applicable only to spouses as is made  clear  at  para  25  of  that
       determination which does not mention extending its guidance to other
       parts of the rules, nor, more specifically, to  paragraph  290  with
       regard to 'post-flight fianc�(e)s.'

   16. Senior Immigration Judge Martin granted permission to appeal  on  28
       February 2011 when she was  in  particular  persuaded  that  it  was
       arguable that the Immigration Judge had erred in  dealing  with  the
       appeal under para 290 of the Rules, although  she  does  not  refuse
       permission based on the Article 8 aspect  nor  otherwise  limit  her
       grant of permission .

   17. Further directions were given on 23 March 2011 and it is in this way
       that the matter comes before me now.

      The Relevant Law

   18. It is accepted by the respondent that she could not  show  that  she
       was genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for  a  limited  period  as
       stated by her, not exceeding 6  months  (paragraph  41(i)),  as  she
       wished to remain in the UK indefinitely with her fianc�. Rather  she
       relies upon Article 8 as read with Article 12 ECHR.

   19. Paragraph 290 is referred to as it is the paragraph that  enables  a
       person seeking leave to enter the UK  as  a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
       civil partner, to apply to an ECO  for  entry  clearance.  Paragraph
       290, as at 1 July 2010,  reads, insofar  as  is  relevant  here,  as
       follows:
           "290. The requirements to be met by a person  seeking  leave  to
           enter the United  Kingdom  as  a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil
           partner are that:
           (i) the applicant is seeking leave to enter the  United  Kingdom
           for marriage or  civil  partnership  to  a  person  present  and
           settled in the United Kingdom or who is  on  the  same  occasion
           being admitted for settlement; and
           (ii) the parties to the proposed marriage or  civil  partnership
           have met; and
           (iii) each of the parties intends to live permanently  with  the
           other as his or her spouse or civil partner after  the  marriage
           or civil partnership ; and
           (iv) adequate maintenance and accommodation without recourse  to
           public funds will be available for the applicant until the  date
           of the marriage or civil partnership ; and
           (v) there will, after the  marriage  or  civil  partnership,  be
           adequate  accommodation  for  the  parties  and  any  dependants
           without recourse to public funds in accommodation which they own
           or occupy exclusively; and
           (vi) the parties will  be  able  after  the  marriage  or  civil
           partnership to maintain themselves and any dependants adequately
           without recourse to public funds; and
           (vii) the applicant holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance
           for entry in this capacity".
Submissions

   20. Mr Kandola for the appellant relied upon the grounds  of  appeal  as
       set out above. He referred to paragraph 6 of the determination under
       appeal, which is where all the findings and conclusions are reached,
       noting that the Immigration Judge finds the sponsor to be a  witness
       of truth to the balance of probabilities and accepts as reliable the
       documentary evidence produced regarding the sponsor's employment and
       the proposed matrimonial home,  finding  that  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 290 are met in relation to maintenance and  accommodation.
       However the judge has erred in finding that:


            'by analogy to being a post-flight  spouse  the  appellant  can
           satisfy the requirements of para  290  and  establish  that  she
           satisfies the requirements of the appropriate immigration rule.'


   21. Further, after finding that the couple have met and intend  to  live
       together in a permanent relationship, he  erroneously  continues  to
       again conclude that the requirements of paragraph 290 have been met.


   22. The Immigration Judge then turns to Article  8,  and  for  the  same
       reasons, that is because the requirements of the rule  are  met,  he
       allows the appeal on human rights grounds.  The  misdirection  under
       the rules taints  the  Article  8  treatment.  There  is  no  proper
       analysis of FH, nor any consideration as to why it should  apply  to
       fianc�(e)s when it was concerned with spouses, and Mr  Ockelton  did
       not go so far as to say that the guidance given extends to fianc�es.
       In FH, at para 11, the Upper Tribunal considers  how  refugees  have
       been disadvantaged because others with limited leave could bring  in
       spouses- for  example  students,   ministers,  artists  and  so  on.
       However, Mr Kandola was not aware  that  such  persons  could  bring
       their fianc�(e)s.

   23. As to whether there was any difference in policy relating  to  those
       who need and enjoy international protection and those  who  do  not,
       such as a student or minister of religion, Mr  Kandola  relied  upon
       the position of the SSHD before the Upper Tribunal in FH as  far  as
       the relevant policy was concerned and had nothing new  to  add.  His
       submissions were relevant to both the error of law  aspect  and,  if
       error of law were to be found, the substantive re-hearing aspect. If
       a finding in favour of the respondent were to be  made,  Mr  Kandola
       submitted that it should include the proviso that each  case  should
       be considered on its own individual facts.

   24. Mr Martin submitted that if it is right that a post flight spouse be
       able to come to the UK to join a refugee, then a fianc�(e) should be
       treated in the same way. He relied upon the response pursuant to the
       Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the  skeleton
       argument he had lodged before the Immigration Judge.

   25. Whilst it was accepted that  the  Immigration  Judge  had  erred  in
       finding that the respondent met the requirements of para 290 because
       the sponsor is not settled in the UK and to that extent that  ground
       is made out, that cannot dispose of the case because it is  accepted
       by the appellant that the Immigration Judge was entitled to consider
       the matter under Article 8  and  he  had  not  materially  erred  in
       allowing the appeal under Article 8. Although FH  deals  with  post-
       flight spouses, it was relevant to the circumstances of  post-flight
       fianc�(e)s. In FH it was held:

           "The Immigration Rules make no provision for  the  admission  of
           post-flight spouses of refugees with limited  leave.  The  Rules
           should be changed. In the mean time it is most unlikely that  it
           will be proportionate to refuse the admission of the spouse of a
           refugee where all the requirements of paragraph 281 are met save
           that relating to settlement."

   26. By analogy, if the respondent could show that  she  could  meet  the
       requirements of paragraph 290, then her appeal should be allowed  on
       article 8 grounds and the Immigration Judge was right to  have  done
       so. Although the appropriate form for paragraph 290 applications had
       not been used by the respondent, it is clear that the information in
       her application covers the same circumstances  as  those  concerning
       the fianc�(e)s of individuals who are settled in the  UK.  As  such,
       this aspect may be considered on appeal applying the  principles  in
       MS (AS & NV) Pakistan [2010] UKUT 117. There is no application  form
       that the respondent could have used and in the circumstances she did
       the best she could by choosing a form for another reason but  making
       the purpose of her application abundantly clear  and  could  not  be
       accused of misleading anybody.

Consideration and Findings

   27. I remind myself that the burden of proof in relation to facts  rests
       with the respondent to the usual civil standard of  the  balance  of
       probabilities. As far as Article 8 ECHR is concerned, it is for  the
       ECO to show that exclusion of the respondent is  lawful,  and  is  a
       necessary and proportionate measure in pursuit of a legitimate aim.


   28. Post decision evidence may be taken into account by  an  immigration
       judge where it casts light upon relevant matters as at the  date  of
       decision.

   29. I have considered all the evidence that was before the judge, in its
       totality, as well as the  respondent's  response  and  the  skeleton
       argument.

   30. It is accepted by the respondent that the Immigration Judge erred in
       concluding that the respondent met the requirements of paragraph 290
       of the Immigration  Rues.  Plainly  she  could  not  do  so  as  her
       fianc�(e) is not settled in the UK.

   31. The respondent argues that the judge was right to conclude that  the
       appeal should be allowed on Article  8  grounds  and  therefore  any
       error he may have made in relation to his treatment  of  the  appeal
       under the rules is not material. However, I prefer  the  grounds  of
       the appellant and the submissions of  Mr  Kandola  in  that  regard,
       which I concur with and adopt in finding that the Immigration  Judge
       did err in law in his treatment of the article 8 aspect,  as  whilst
       he correctly finds that there is private life being enjoyed and that
       there is nascent family life if not actual family life between  this
       couple, the  only  reason  that  the  Immigration  Judge  gives  for
       allowing the appeal under Article 8  is  that  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 290 are met, which, manifestly, they are not. He makes  no
       mention at all of the case  of  FH  so  that  the  reader  could  be
       forgiven for thinking that it was not referred to before him when it
       is dealt with as the main limb of the  appeal, albeit  that  it  was
       not raised before the ECO until  the  appeal  stage.  No  doubt  the
       Immigration Judge was not helped by  the  fact  that  there  was  no
       presenting officer at the hearing. There are a  number  of  relevant
       facts set out in the evidence of the sponsor that are summarised  at
       para 4 of the determination, but they are not all  brought  to  bear
       when the Immigration Judge is giving reasons for  his  decision.  In
       all the circumstances I am satisfied that the Immigration Judge  did
       fall into material error of law and I therefore move to re-make  the
       decision.

Remaking the Decision

   32. It is not in issue before me that Article 8 family and private  life
       rights are  engaged  here  nor  that  the  appellant's  decision  to
       exclude, whilst in accordance with the law and in pursuance  of  the
       legitimate aim of the maintenance of fair immigration  control,  has
       consequences of sufficient gravity so as to  require  the  balancing
       exercise to be conducted in order to  answer  the  question  whether
       exclusion of the appellant is a proportionate response so that it is
       necessary in a democratic society.


   33. The ECM has wrongly stated in her review that Article 8 is  a  right
       'proportionate with the need to maintain  an  effective  immigration
       and border control, and that 'decisions made  under  the  rules  are
       deemed to be compliant with human rights legislation.'

   34.  The need to maintain an effective immigration and border control is
       no doubt a the legitimate aim that the ECO pursues, but as has  been
       indicated, it is for the ECO to show that the measure to exclude  is
       necessary and proportionate to that aim and that no  lesser  measure
       will suffice.

   35.  Whilst  it  is  certainly  understood  to  be  the  case  that  the
       Immigration Rules are drafted with the intent  to  be  human  rights
       compliant, it does not follow that decisions made pursuant to  those
       rules  are  themselves  therefore  compliant   with   human   rights
       legislation.

   36. The respondent finds herself in this difficult position because  her
       fianc�(e), whom, it is accepted, she has known for many  years,  and
       with whom she was in a relationship prior to his fleeing  Sri  Lanka
       in 2000, has been granted only limited leave to remain in the UK  as
       a refugee. Mr Kandola accepted that there was no  other  rule  under
       which she could make application to enter  the  UK  followed  by  an
       application for leave to remain. He founded upon it being reasonable
       to require the sponsor and respondent to go to a  third  country  to
       marry and reside.

   37. Mr Martin, however, rightly submits that the refugee sponsor, unlike
       a student, cannot go home to marry his fianc�. As to  requiring  the
       couple to go to a third country, is it reasonable that difficulty be
       placed in their way? And in any event what country could that be? It
       might be argued that he could go to India were he a Tamil, but he is
       Sinhalese and the links with Tamil Nadu do not exist. There would be
       a need to obtain visas, the expense of  so  doing,  as  well  as  of
       somewhere to stay whilst complying with foreign  marriage  laws  and
       the cost of so complying. Perhaps  also  of  seeking  permission  to
       reside in a third country.   There  would  still  be  the  need  for
       application for leave as a spouse once that  became  feasible,  with
       further delay and cost. Once lawfully in the UK as  a  fianc�e,  she
       should have the possibility to apply for further leave  from  within
       the UK on human rights grounds if on  no  other  basis  (  see  e.g.
       Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40).

   38. It  was  accepted  by  Mr  Kandola  that  even  if  there  had  been
       application for a visa under paragraph 56D of HC 395, the respondent
       could still not qualify  to  apply  under  paragraph  319L  as  this
       relates to applications for leave to enter only, so she would  still
       need to leave the UK and re-apply to join her then husband.

   39. I am mindful that although this couple  did  not  marry  before  the
       sponsor left Sri Lanka, it is accepted that  it  is  a  genuine  and
       subsisting long term relationship, and that each  intends  to  marry
       and live permanently with the other, despite their long  separation.
       She has twice tried to obtain a student visa  without  success,  and
       they have kept in regular touch since the sponsor's  departure.   He
       has sent remittances to her. It is also  appropriate  to  take  into
       account and give weight to the ages of the  sponsor  and  respondent
       and the fact that they wish to found a family, having  taken  notice
       of the fact that founding a family tends to become  less  easy  with
       maturity and that there is a limit to the time in which a woman  may
       be expected to bear children. The respondent was born  in  1973  and
       the sponsor in 1962, so that their wish to found  a  family  without
       delay is wholly understandable.

   40. The sponsor works as a trained carer in the  UK  and  earns  between
       �1300 and �1500 per month. His rent is �450 per month for the double
       room in London SW14, where it is proposed the respondent would  join
       him. The Immigration Judge finds, applying KA and Ors  (adequacy  of
       maintenance) Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT  00065,  that  the  couple  can
       maintain and  accommodate  themselves  without  recourse  to  public
       funds. No issue has been taken by Mr Kandola in relation to  any  of
       the facts of the case as relied on by the Immigration Judge  and  it
       is not argued that he was in error to conclude that the requirements
       of the rules as they stood at the relevant time were met,  save,  of
       course, in relation to the fact that the sponsor is not  settled  in
       the UK.

   41. Mr Kandola could not offer any  policy  reason  why  the  respondent
       should not be permitted to apply under the Rules to enter the UK  as
       a fianc�e to join her refugee partner. He  simply  relied  upon  the
       position of the SSHD in FH. In that regard, it  is  noted  that  the
       Vice President of the Upper Tribunal said at para 11 that:

        "Comparable situations

       11. The Secretary of State recognises  that  "post-flight  spouses",
           such as the appellant,  cannot  qualify  under  the  Immigration
           Rules. In that respect, they are treated  differently  not  only
           from pre-flight spouses (paragraph  352A)  and  the  spouses  of
           those settled in the UK  (paragraph  281),  but  also  from  the
           spouses of others granted temporary leave in the United Kingdom.
           The spouses of students, those working in  the  United  Kingdom,
           businessmen, artists, ministers of religion and so on may obtain
           leave in the United Kingdom under paragraphs 76 or (principally)
           194, even though the sponsor has only limited  leave,  and  even
           though the marriage took place after the  sponsor  came  to  the
           United Kingdom. From that point of view, therefore, refugees are
           in a particularly disadvantageous position.  If,  after  leaving
           their country of nationality, they  contract  a  marriage  to  a
           person who is not a British (or EEA) national,  the  Immigration
           Rules do not provide for the couple  to  live  together  in  the
           United Kingdom. It is, as we remarked at the hearing,  odd  that
           the refugee should be disadvantaged in that way, because, unlike
           other persons with limited leave in the United Kingdom under the
           Rules, the refugee is a person who cannot return home  to  enjoy
           married life there".

   42. At paragraph 19 it was noted that the presenting officer was


           "unable to say whether the consequence for spouses of the change
           of policy was intentional or unintentional. The position  as  it
           is before us is that, as we have indicated,  the  appellant  and
           other post-flight spouses seem to be the subject of particularly
           disadvantageous treatment; no public interest in that  treatment
           has been identified; the Secretary of State is not even able  to
           say whether the difference is intentional: but the effect of the
           Rules is that the difference undoubtedly exists."

   43. The case of FH does indeed only concern post-flight spouses, but  it
       does make relevant observations that apply to the  circumstances  of
       this appeal, so that I find that fianc�es such as the appellant  are
       similarly situated to the spouses of post-flight refugees, save,  of
       course, that they were not in the committed relationship of marriage
       prior to the refugee spouse's flight. In addition,  a  student  will
       not be able to be joined by a fianc�(e), but of course the  student,
       or other individual with limited leave is able to go home  in  order
       to marry where the refugee is not. It  is  in  that  light  that  Mr
       Kandola's submission that each case must fall to  be  considered  on
       its own individual facts and merits has force.


   44. A post flight fianc�(e) of a refugee may  have  become  a  fianc�(e)
       after a long and committed relationship in the country of origin  of
       the refugee, such as that with which the Upper Tribunal is concerned
       in this appeal, or after a much shorter time and in wholly different
       circumstances. See the determination of the Upper Tribunal in FH  at
       para 24, where there is a reminder of the need for great caution  in
       using the European Convention on Human  Rights  to  cover  perceived
       defects in the Immigration Rules.


   45. Although it has been said that the couple could marry  elsewhere  or
       live elsewhere as husband and wife, there is  no  suggestion  as  to
       where that could be and no realistic argument or evidence as to  any
       relevant third country has emerged. Nor has  Mr  Kandola  sought  to
       argue, assuming any such country were to be found, that it would  be
       reasonable that the respondent and sponsor should have to deal  with
       the upheaval, uncertainty  and expense involved. The  appellant  ECO
       does not argue that the respondent fails to meet the requirements of
       paragraph 290 of the Immigration Rules as they then were,  save  for
       the  requirement  relating  to  settlement.   No   cogent   argument
       justifying her exclusion on grounds that it would  be  proportionate
       has been advanced, and, for all the foregoing reasons, the article 8
       rights of the respondent and sponsor  require  that  the  appeal  be
       allowed and that the respondent be granted entry clearance.

   46. It is also relevant here to recall para 25 of the  determination  in
       FH:

           "25.But, on the other hand, the appellant's situation is  by  no
           means an unusual one, and it arises from provisions of the Rules
           for which there appears to be no justification. Unless there  is
           some justification, of which we have not been made aware, of the
           Rules' treatment of  post-flight  spouses,  we  think  that  the
           Secretary of State ought to give urgent  attention  to  amending
           the Rules,  by  extending  either  paragraph  281  or,  (perhaps
           preferably) paragraph 194, so as to extend  to  the  spouses  of
           those with limited leave to remain  as  refugees.  In  the  mean
           time, it seems to us that although a decision based on Article 8
           does have to be an individual one  in  each  case,  it  is  most
           unlikely that the Secretary  of  State  or  an  Entry  Clearance
           Officer will be able to establish that it  is  proportionate  to
           exclude from the United Kingdom  the  post-flight  spouse  of  a
           refugee where  the  applicant  meets  all  the  requirements  of
           paragraph 281 save that relating to settlement".

   47. For like reasons, the  Secretary  of  State  ought  to  give  urgent
       consideration to amending the Rules as they concern fianc�(e)s.


   48. For the reasons given, the Immigration Judge has materially erred in
       law and a determination to allow the appeal is substituted,  with  a
       direction that entry clearance in the usual form be issued to her.
