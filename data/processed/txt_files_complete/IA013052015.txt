                                                                    Claimant

Officer)
For the Claimant: Mr Arayn (Legal Representative)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge S. Taylor dated the 16th December 2015,  in  which
      she allowed the Claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules, as  the
      spouse of a UK citizen under Appendix FM.  For the purpose of  clarity
      throughout this decision, although it  is  the  Secretary  of  State's
      appeal, I will refer to the Secretary of State as being "the Secretary
      of State" and the Appellant in the First-tier  Tribunal  Mr  Singh  as
      being "the Claimant".

   2. The Secretary of State has sought to appeal against  the  decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge S. Taylor for the reasons set out within the
      Grounds of Appeal.  It is argued, inter alia, that the  Judge  made  a
      material misdirection of fact when noting that the Claimant's evidence
      was that he had always been law abiding, whereas in fact as  disclosed
      by the Police National Computer report (PNC) attached to  the  Grounds
      of Appeal, it is said that the Claimant was in fact in  prison  for  6
      months in 2011 for obtaining leave by deception.   Within  the  second
      Ground of  Appeal  it  is  argued  that  the  Judge  made  a  material
      misdirection in law in that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  no
      reference to paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM under the Immigration Rules
      which defined "insurmountable obstacles" as meaning "very  significant
      difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their partner in
      continuing their family life together outside the UK and  which  could
      not be  overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious  hardship  for  the
      applicant  or  their  partner.".   It  is  argued  that  the   Judge's
      assessment of the insurmountable obstacles has not been placed  within
      its proper framework and it is not clear that the Judge  had  in  mind
      the very high threshold imported by  paragraph  EX.2.   It  is  argued
      further by placing weight upon the business interests of the  Claimant
      in the UK that the Judge focussed on matters of the Claimant's private
      life and not obstacles to "family life" continuing in India  and  that
      the analysis should concentrate on family life, and not "on  the  loss
      of benefits to which an appellant might lose should he leave the  UK".
      It is argued that the Judge erroneously focussed on matters  ancillary
      to family life continuing in India and has  not  focussed  on  matters
      necessary for its continuance.  It is further argued that by virtue of
      Section  117(b)(5)  little  weight  should  have  been  given  to  the
      Claimant's private life as his status was precarious.  It  is  further
      argued that the Judge misconstrued the case of Chikwamaba, which would
      only apply if an application for entry clearance was bound to  succeed
      and the Judge made no such findings that an application would  succeed
      and hence reliance on that principle was said to be erroneous.

   3. Permission to appeal has been granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  P.
      J. M. Hollingworth, on the 30th June 2016, in which it was stated that
      "an arguable error of law has  arisen  in  that  the  Judge  has  made
      findings of fact in the context  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of
      insurmountable obstacles without first making  a  finding  as  to  the
      credibility of the Claimant, in light of the fact  that  the  Claimant
      described himself as being law abiding, whereas  the  file  of  papers
      referred to the Claimant as having had a conviction and that the Judge
      had set out his findings  and  did  not  make  a  finding  as  to  the
      credibility of  the  Claimant  in  giving  evidence  set  against  the
      reference in the file of papers  submitted  for  the  appeal  hearing,
      which disclosed the conviction.

   4. It was on that basis that the case proceeded before me  in  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

   5. At the start of  the  appeal  hearing,  Mr  Arayn  on  behalf  of  the
      Claimant, submitted a Skeleton Argument,  which  I  have  fully  taken
      account of in reaching my decision.

   6. In her oral submissions, Mrs Ahmad conceded that the printout from the
      PNC which is dated the 4th January 2016, was not before the First-tier
      Tribunal Judge when he heard the appeal on  the  16th  December  2015.
      She argued that the notice of the conviction  had  been  raised  as  a
      matter within the refusal notice, and argued that it was therefore  an
      issue before the Court, and that the Judge may have been  entitled  to
      reject the point.  However, she conceded  that  there  was  no  actual
      evidence of the conviction in that  the  assertions  made  within  the
      refusal notice were not themselves evidence, and that he PNC report of
      the conviction, was not before the Judge.  However,  she  argued  that
      the Judge had not considered this matter.

   7. Mrs Ahmad further argued that the Judge had not  considered  Paragraph
      EX.2 when considering insurmountable obstacles and that following  the
      case of  Agyarko  and  Others  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440, that the fact that the Sponsor  was  a
      British citizen, lived all her life in the UK and had a job in the  UK
      and  may  find  it  difficult  to  relocate  would   not   amount   to
      insurmountable obstacles.  She  further  argued  that  the  Judge  had
      thereby applied the wrong legal test.  She also argued that the  Judge
      was wrong to consider the Chikwamaba case, as this was  a  case  where
      the applicant would be removed from the United Kingdom and  forced  to
      make an out of country application for leave to enter which was  bound
      to be successful and which would thereby violate his Article  8  Human
      Rights.

   8. In his submissions on behalf of the Claimant, Mr Arayn relied upon the
      Skeleton Argument.  He argued that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
      set out specifically reference to Paragraph EX.1(b), and that  he  did
      not need to go on to specifically set out the terms of Paragraph EX.2,
      as the Judge is taken to know the law and had referred to the test  of
      insurmountable obstacles.  He further argued that the  Judge  had  not
      made any specific findings regarding the Claimant  being  law  abiding
      and argued that the Secretary  of  State  simply  disagreed  with  the
      findings made by the Judge.  He argued that the fact that the  Sponsor
      had a business in the UK was not the only consideration, but also  the
      fact that the Claimant had lived in the UK for 10 years by that stage,
      that he was in a genuine relationship with a UK citizen, and that  she
      was pregnant at the time and that the Judge  had  properly  considered
      the fact  that  the  business  employed  10  people,  including  4  UK
      citizens, had an annual turnover of between �450,000 and �600,000, and
      that the business could not be run from abroad  as  this  would  cause
      compliance problems with the Department of Transport, if the owner  of
      the business was not in the country and that no-one was  available  in
      the country to take responsibility  for  compliance  matters  such  as
      drivers' hours and condition of vehicles, were the Sponsor not  to  be
      in the UK. He argued that the Judge had also take  into  account  that
      the business had business loans of approximately  �200,000  for  which
      the partners were jointly responsible and submitted that the  findings
      of the Judge were open to him on the evidence.   He  argued  that  the
      Judge had referred to the fact that the Claimant had obtained leave by
      deception at paragraph 1 of his judgement.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

   9. Although First-tier Tribunal Judge S. Taylor, did refer in paragraph 1
      of his judgement to the fact that the Claimant has been served with  a
      notice under the Immigration Acts on the 18th August 2011  as  he  had
      obtained leave to remain in the UK by deception,  the  Judge  did  not
      specifically  make  reference  to  the  conviction  of  the  Claimant.
      However, in this regard, the evidence from the PNC  referring  to  the
      fact the Claimant had  been  convicted  and  sentenced  to  6  months'
      imprisonment as a result of having sought to obtain leave to enter the
      UK by deception, was dated the 4th January 2016, and therefore clearly
      was not before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  as  conceded  by  Mrs
      Ahmad, as at the date of the hearing before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      S. Taylor on the 16th December 2015.  Mrs Ahmad  conceded  that  there
      was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge in respect of the
      conviction, at that stage, other than the fact that she contended that
      the fact of a conviction and his imprisonment  had  been  referred  to
      within the original reasons for refusal letter.  Although the  reasons
      for refusal letter did  refer  to  the  conviction,  the  reasons  for
      refusal letter is not evidence of the matters contained  therein,  and
      evidence would still have to be presented by the Secretary  of  State.
      There was no evidence, other  than  an  assertion  of  the  conviction
      within the refusal notice, before the Judge in December 2015.

  10. However, in any event, although  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
      noted that the Claimant's evidence was that he had "always contributed
      to the economy, paid tax and been law abiding", the Judge did not make
      any specific findings on  the  question  as  to  whether  or  not  the
      Claimant was law abiding, and this did not form part  of  the  reasons
      for his decision in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the judgement.

  11. Given that there was no evidence in support of  the  assertion  within
      the refusal notice that the Claimant had been convicted and  sentenced
      to imprisonment for seeking to obtain  entry  clearance  by  deception
      before the Judge, the Judge did not materially err, in failing to make
      findings in this regard and the only findings he would have made,  had
      he made findings on the point  would  have  been  that  there  was  no
      evidence produced by the Respondent to support their assertion at that
      date.   The  evidence  that  has  now  been  produced  post-dates  the
      decision.  No application was made by Mrs Ahmad before me to admit the
      post-appeal evidence in compliance with the principles set down by the
      Court of Appeal in the case of Ladd v Marshall [1954] EWCA Civ 1,  and
      in such circumstances, the evidence as from the PNC computer cannot be
      utilised to establish that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge was in fact based upon an error of fact amounting to a  material
      error of law.  Mrs Ahmad did not make an application for that evidence
      to be admitted, and in any event, she did not seek to argue  that  the
      criteria for  admission  under  Ladd  v  Marshall  were  met,  and  no
      explanation was given as to why  the  evidence  could  not  have  been
      obtained with reasonable diligence for use at  the  original  hearing.
      However, given  that  the  Judge  was  simply  noting  the  Claimant's
      testimony regarding him being law  abiding,  and  that  this  had  not
      formed part of the Judge's reasoning, I  am  not  persuaded  that  the
      Judge materially erred in his consideration  in  that  regard  in  any
      event.

  12. In respect of the assertion that the Judge erred in his  consideration
      of "insurmountable  obstacles",  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has
      clearly noted that the issue before him in effect amounting to whether
      or not there would  be  unsurmountable  obstacles  to  the  Claimant's
      family life with  the  Sponsor  continuing  outside  the  UK  for  the
      purposes of Paragraph EX.1(b) of the Immigration Rules.

  13. In the Supreme Court case of MA (Somalia) (Respondent) v The Secretary
      of State for the Home Department (Appellant) [2010] UKSC 49, Sir  John
      Dyson SCJ, given the judgement of the Court adopted at paragraph 43 of
      the judgement the remarks of Baroness Hale of Richmond in the case  of
      AH (Sudan) v The Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2007]
      UKHL 49, at paragraph 30, where she stated that:

           "This is an expert Tribunal charged with administering a complex
           area of law in challenging circumstances.  The  ordinary  Courts
           should approach appeals from them with an appropriate degree  of
           caution... it is probable that in understanding and applying the
           law in their specialised field the Tribunal  will  have  got  it
           right... they and they  alone  are  judges  of  the  facts...  a
           decision should be respected unless it is quite clear that  they
           have misdirected themselves in law.  Appellant Courts should not
           rush to find such misdirection simply because  they  might  have
           reached  a  different  conclusion  on  the  facts  or  expressed
           themselves differently."

  14. Paragraph EX.1(b) stated that  "This  paragraph  applies  if  (b)  the
      applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who
      is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in the UK or in the  UK
      with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian  protection,  and   there   are
      insurmountable obstacles to family life with that  partner  continuing
      outside of the UK".  Paragraph EX.2 states that "For the  purposes  of
      Paragraph  EX.1(b)   'insurmountable   obstacles'   means   the   very
      significant difficulties which would be  faced  by  the  applicant  or
      their partner in continuing their family life together outside the  UK
      and which could not be overcome or would entail very serious  hardship
      for the applicant or their partner".  In such circumstances, Paragraph
      EX.2  simply  defines  "insurmountable  obstacles"   under   Paragraph
      EX.1(b).  As  stated  by  Baroness  Hale,  it  is  probably  that   in
      understanding and applying the  law  in  their  specialised  field,  a
      Tribunal would have got it right and the decision should be  respected
      unless it is quite clear a Judge has misdirected themselves in law.

  15. Although First-tier Tribunal Judge Taylor has not specifically set out
      Paragraph EX.2, he had clearly set out the appropriate test  in  terms
      of  whether  or  not  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to   the
      Claimant's family life with the Sponsor continuing outside of  the  UK
      at [12] of the judgement, and in such circumstances, although  he  may
      not have gone on to state the definition of "insurmountable obstacles"
      under Paragraph EX.2, there is not actual obligation on him to set out
      the definition under  Paragraph  EX.2,  if  he  has  applied  the  law
      correctly.

  16. Although in this regard it is argued that the Judge  had  focussed  on
      matters of the Claimant's private life and not  obstacles  to  "family
      life" continuing  in  India,  by  placing  weight  upon  the  business
      interests that the Claimant had in the UK, in  fact,  when  reads  the
      judgment of First-tier Tribunal Judge S. Taylor, it is clear that  the
      business was that of the Sponsor, not of the  Claimant  and  that  the
      Claimant simply supported her in the business. It  was  the  Sponsor's
      business that employed 10 people, including 4 UK citizens and  it  was
      expecting an annual turnover of between �450,000 and �600,000 and  had
      bases in London and Leicestershire and a fleet of 7 trucks  delivering
      material on a daily basis on the evidence given as recorded at [7]  of
      the decision.  The Judge in his findings found that the  Claimant  was
      married to a UK citizen and that his removal would involve requiring a
      UK citizen to leave the UK, her place of birth and country where  most
      of her family live and that at the time the Sponsor was pregnant,  and
      the Judge further accepted at [13] the oral evidence of  the  Claimant
      that the business would  encounter  considerable  compliance  problems
      with the Department of Transport, if the owner of the business was not
      in the country and  no-one  was  available  in  the  country  to  take
      responsibility for compliance matters such as the drivers'  hours  and
      condition of vehicles.  The Judge further noted  that  "An  additional
      matter which arose in evidence was that  the  Appellant  was  a  joint
      guarantor on the business loans.  The business currently  had  ongoing
      business loans of approximately �200,000 for which  the  parties  were
      jointly responsible.  The banks may well have an issue with continuing
      to offer a loan facility if both guarantors and owners of the business
      left the UK.   The  parties  operate  a  substantial  business  of  10
      employees and 9 trucks, and I am satisfied that the business could not
      be operated by the parties if they lived abroad.  I also consider that
      the business loans,  which  were  in  substantial  sums  would  be  in
      jeopardy, which would place the business at risk,  together  with  the
      capital of the parties and the employment of their staff".

  17.  The Judge went on to  find  "I  find  that  given  the  business  and
      commitments  which  the  parties  have  in  the  UK,  there  would  be
      insurmountable obstacles to their continued relationship  outside  the
      UK".

  18.  In this case, it was not simply as in the Agyarko case,  where  there
      was a British citizen who had had a job in the UK and who  would  find
      it difficult to relocate. In this case, I find the Judge was  entitled
      to consider that the business owned by the Sponsor, and the fact  that
      the Sponsor would not be able to run the business from outside of  the
      UK given the compliance problems with the Department of Transport  and
      that no-one would be available in the country to  take  responsibility
      for compliance matters. He was entitled to take into consideration the
      effect that would have on her business and the fact that the  business
      had bank loans of approximately �200,000 for which  the  parties  were
      jointly responsible, and also the potential effect on  the  employees,
      in determining whether or not there were insurmountable  obstacles  to
      family life continuing between the parties outside  of  the  UK.   The
      fact that this would potentially expose  the  Sponsor  to  losing  her
      business and being liable for �200,000 of business loan for which they
      were jointly responsible, was a relevant factor,  in  determining  the
      issue of whether or not those insurmountable obstacles to family  life
      continued outside of the UK.  The Judge was perfectly entitled to take
      account of the effect on the Sponsor's  business,  and  the  financial
      losses to which she would be exposed, if the  couple  were  forced  to
      continue their family life outside  of  the  UK.  This  case  is  very
      different to the Agyarko case, given the  nature  and  extent  of  the
      sponsor's interests in the UK and the effect upon her were she to  try
      to continue her  family  life  with  the  Appellant  outside  the  UK.
      Further, this is not, as suggested within the Grounds of  Appeal,  the
      Judge focussing on the private life of the Claimant, as it was not his
      business, it was that  of  his  wife  and  Sponsor,  although  he  was
      substantially involved in assisting his wife with her business.

  19. Given that the business was actually owned by the Sponsor rather  than
      the Claimant, the Judge has not acted in breach of Section 117B(5), in
      considering the Sponsor's business, as although under Section 117B(5),
      little weight should be given to the  private  life  of  the  Claimant
      formed at a time when  his  status  in  the  UK  was  precarious,  the
      business was actually in  fact  owned  by  the  Sponsor,  not  by  the
      Claimant.

  20. In such circumstances I find that the Judge was perfectly entitled  in
      the circumstances of this case, to take account of the effect  on  the
      Sponsor's business, and the exposure  that  she  would  have  then  to
      �200,000 joint liability under the business loans, and the  fact  that
      the business did employ a number of people, and the capital  that  had
      been invested, in determining whether or not there were insurmountable
      obstacles to the family life continuing outside  of  the  UK.   In  my
      judgment, the finding of the Immigration Judge in that  regard  was  a
      finding that was perfectly open to him on the evidence before him  and
      that  his  reasons  have  been  fully,  adequately  and   sufficiently
      explained.

  21. In such circumstances I do not consider that the  decision  of  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge S. Taylor contains any material errors of law  and
      the decision is maintained.  I  therefore  dismiss  the  Secretary  of
      State's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge S. Taylor  does  not  contain  any
material errors of law and is maintained.

The First-tier Tribunal did not make any anonymity direction  in  this  case
and no such direction was sought before me.  I therefore  do  not  make  any
anonymity direction.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McGinty     Dated 9th August 2016
