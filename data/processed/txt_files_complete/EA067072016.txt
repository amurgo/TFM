For the Appellant:     Mr M Bhuiyal (Universal Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born  on  8  March  1990.   He
    appeals the decision of the Secretary of State on 27 May 2016 to refuse
    to issue an EEA residence card to him as  an  extended  family  member.
    The appellant's appeal came before a First-tier Judge on 14 August 2017
    on the papers.  The judge, applying the decision  of  the  Tribunal  in
    Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 0041 (IAC) found  she  had  no
    jurisdiction in the matter and dismissed the appeal.

2.   The appellant applied for  permission  to  appeal  and  permission  was
    granted on 23 January 2018 in the light of the decision of the Court of
    Appeal in Khan v Secretary  of  State  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1755.   Since
    permission was granted the Supreme Court in SM (Algeria) [2018] UKSC 9
    confirmed the decision in Khan and stated that Sala should be overruled
    (paragraph  39  of  the  judgment).  At  the  hearing  before  me   the
    representatives agreed in the circumstances  that  there  should  be  a
    fresh hearing before a different First-tier Judge.

3.   In the light of the agreed position between the  parties  I  find  that
    the First-tier Judge erred in law, although she  cannot  be  criticised
    for applying the decision in Sala.  In  the  circumstances  the  appeal
    must, as the parties requested, be remitted for a fresh hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal should be  heard  by  a  different
    First-tier Judge.

Notice of Decision

4.   The First-tier Judge materially erred in law.

5.   I remit the appeal for a fresh hearing.

6.   The First-tier Judge made no anonymity order and I make none.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The First-tier Judge made no fee award and in the circumstances  I  consider
it premature to make an award.  An award can be considered when the case  is
finally determined.


Signed                                  Date 27 March 2018
