For the Appellant:     Ms C Grubb instructed by Hoole & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who was born on  6  March  1969.
      He arrived in the United Kingdom as a visitor with his daughter  on  5
      May 2002.  Subsequently, he was granted leave as a student valid until
      31 December 2004.  A subsequent application as a spouse  of  a  person
      settled in the UK was made on 26 October 2004 but was refused and  his
      appeal was withdrawn on 20 May  2005.   Between  2005  and  2010,  the
      appellant remained in the UK without leave.  On 15 September 2010,  he
      made an application for discretionary leave in order  to  remain  with
      his daughter as a dependent.  That leave was granted to  him  and  his
      daughter valid until 30 September 2013.   On  25  September  2013,  he
      applied for further leave to remain in the UK  on  the  basis  of  his
      private life.  On 18 November 2013, the Secretary of State refused his
      application under para 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules  (HC  395  as
      amended) and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

   2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a determination
      promulgated on 9 June 2014, Judge Britton  dismissed  the  appellant's
      appeal.  The  Judge  found  that  the  appellant's  removal  would  be
      proportionate.

   3. On 26 June 2014, the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Bird)  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Thus,  the
      appeal came before me.

The Submissions

   4. Ms Grubb, who  represented  the  appellant,  adopted  the  grounds  of
      appeal.  She submitted that the Judge had made a material error of law
      in reaching his adverse proportionality finding by concluding that the
      appellant had returned to Jamaica between 2005 and 2010 and thus, even
      though he may not have  close  family  ties  in  Jamaica,  finding  he
      certainly had friends there and would have no problems returning there
      now.  Ms Grubb submitted that contrary to  the  Judge's  assertion  in
      paragraph 22 of his determination, the appellant had produced evidence
      that he was in the UK during that period.  At page 64 of  the  bundle,
      she relied on an email from his employer which stated that he had been
      continuously employed in the UK by that employer from June 2007  until
      7 May 2012.  In addition, Ms Grubb relied upon a  number  of  payslips
      (at pages 67-92 of the appellant's bundle) dated  between  6  February
      2004 and 12 October 2013, the majority of which, she  submitted,  were
      evidence of the appellant's presence in the UK during the period  that
      the Judge had found against the appellant on the basis that he had not
      produced any evidence that he was in the country.

   5. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richards accepted that the  Judge  had
      made an error in reaching his adverse proportionality finding and that
      that error was material to his decision to  dismiss  the  appeal.   He
      accepted that the First-tier Tribunal's decision could not  stand  and
      should be set aside.

Decision

   6. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss  the
      appellant's appeal involved the  making  of  an  error  of  law.   Its
      decision cannot stand and I set it aside.

   7. Ms Grubb invited me to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  in
      order that the decision could be made afresh in the light  of  current
      circumstances.  In particular, she drew my attention to the fact  that
      the appellant's grandfather was now dead and the appellant now  had  a
      grandchild in the UK.  Mr  Richards  did  not  seek  to  suggest  that
      remittal was other than the correct disposal of this appeal.

   8. Having regard to the Senior President's Practice Statement at para 7.2
      and the nature and extent of the fact finding exercise required,  this
      appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo  rehearing
      before a judge other than Judge Britton.
