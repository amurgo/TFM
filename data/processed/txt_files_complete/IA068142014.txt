For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnson - Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the Determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney  issued
    on 21st July 2014 allowing under the Immigration Rules  the  appeal  of
    the Appellant against the decision  of  the  Respondent  made  on  13th
    January 2013 to refuse  to  vary  his  leave  to  remain  and  to  give
    directions for his removal under Section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.

 2.  The  Appellant  had  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points-Based System.  The Secretary of
    State had refused the application because the Appellant had  failed  to
    supply a required letter from the financial institution which held  the
    account of the third party who had supplied funds to the Appellant  for
    his business.  There was also an issue with evidence to show  that  the
    business was actively trading.  Judge De Haney said  that  because  the
    evidence before him  was  overwhelming,   he  was  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant is in business as claimed, that he is trading  and  has  been
    since 1st January 2012 and that he has access to the  �50,000  required
    under the Rules.  He accepted that  at  the  date  of  application  the
    Appellant had been unable to submit the required financial statement in
    the required format showing that he had access to the  �50,000  but  an
    explanation  was  given  for  this  both   in   the   application   and
    subsequently.  He found that the Respondent had failed to exercise  her
    discretion under paragraph 245AA (the flexibility policy) and that   if
    that discretion  had  been  exercised  the  evidence  could  have  been
    produced by the Appellant which would have shown that he fulfilled  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  He expressed the view that  the
    whole point of the Respondent incorporating the flexibility policy into
    the Immigration Rules was surely so that genuine  applicants  like  the
    Appellant "would not be  disadvantaged  by  the  complex  and  stifling
    minutiae which has been incorporated into all  these  appendices".   He
    concluded:

         "I see little point in remitting the decision to the Respondent  as
         being 'unlawful' because this would simply be a further handicap to
         the Appellant progressing with his business and put the  Respondent
         to extra  expense  in  an  already  overburdened  and  bureaucratic
         system."

 3. He allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted on 18th November 2014 by  a  Judge  of
    the Upper Tribunal, permission having been refused by a  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 11th August 2014.  The First-tier  Tribunal  had
    taken the view that the Grounds of Appeal amount only to a disagreement
    with the Judge's findings that had the Respondent taken account of  the
    flexibility policy the evidence that could have been  produced  by  the
    Appellant would have shown that he fulfilled the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The view of the  Upper  Tribunal  was  that  it  is
    arguable that the Judge erred in his  conclusion  in  relation  to  the
    applicability of the evidential flexibility Rule as  contended  in  the
    grounds seeking permission. Also arguable was the  submission  that  in
    the alternative, rather than allowing the appeal outright,  the  matter
    should have been remitted to the Respondent for a lawful decision to be
    made.

 5. It is submitted in the grounds seeking permission that Judge  De  Haney
    erred in failing to  properly  apply  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    related flexibility policy.  Reliance is placed on the decision of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA  Civ
    2 in which the Court of Appeal said that requests by  the  Home  Office
    for information should not be speculative and there must be  sufficient
    reason to believe that any evidence  requested  exists.   It  was  also
    stated that the policy  is  not  designed  to  give  an  applicant  the
    opportunity first to remedy any defect or inadequacy in the application
    or supporting documentation so as to save the application refusal after
    substantive consideration.  It is submitted that the Secretary of State
    was not required to contact the Appellant and offer him the opportunity
    to provide further documentation as there was not sufficient reason  to
    believe that satisfactory documents  existed.   Paragraph  245AA(b)  is
    then set out in the grounds, the submission being that the deficiencies
    in the application in this case do not fall within the scope of  245AA.
    The appeal should have been dismissed.

 6. With regard to the decision of the Judge not to remit the case back  to
    the Respondent it is submitted that Judge De Haney  wrongly  took  into
    account evidence submitted after the decision had been made and this is
    contrary to Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002.  The provisions of Section 85A(4) are set out.   The  application
    was a Points-Based System application and as such fell within Exception
    2 under Section 85A.  The Tribunal was only able to  consider  evidence
    adduced by the Appellant if it was submitted in support of and  at  the
    time of making the application.  The Judge erred in failing to properly
    apply Section 85A.

 7. At the hearing before me Ms Pledger submitted that there was  only  one
    document  missing.   The  bank  statements  showed  the  funds  so  the
    Secretary of State had the necessary information although she  did  not
    have evidence of it.  She said that when the Appellant, with  the  help
    of his representative, was  submitting  the  application  he  made  the
    Secretary of State aware that he did not have the necessary letter  but
    that he and his representatives  were trying to get it.   The  position
    of Ms Johnson was that the  Rules  have  to  be  met  at  the  date  of
    application and they were not.  Ms Pledger responded that it would  not
    have been a speculative request because the information was there.   It
    was a genuine case - there was just no letter from  the  bank  and  the
    Home Office should have asked for it.

 8. I do have some sympathy with the Appellant in this case  but  I  cannot
    uphold the decision of Judge De Haney because I do not believe it to be
    correct.  It is the case that the Rules are complex, strict  and  often
    difficult  to  understand.   That  does  not  mean  however  that   the
    provisions are unnecessary or indeed overly harsh.  The Rules  relating
    to  the  provision  of  funds  by  a  third  party  are  of   necessity
    particularly strict.  I accept that there was some  evidence  of  funds
    evidence before the Secretary of State but there was also an acceptance
    by the Appellant's representatives that the  provisions  of  the  Rules
    could not be met at the date of application and  Ms  Johnson  made  the
    reasonable point that the application should perhaps not have been made
    until all the documentation could  be  produced.   She  said  that  the
    timing of the application was crucial and I agree with that.   I  agree
    with the comments made in the grounds relative  to  Section  85A.   The
    question in this case is whether or not the Secretary of State ought to
    have exercised the flexibility policy.  Ms Johnson was  not  averse  to
    the case being remitted to the Secretary of  State  so  that  a  lawful
    decision can be made and  said  that  this  could  be  done  reasonably
    quickly.  It seems to me that Judge De Haney did not have  jurisdiction
    to allow the appeal as he did.  It was for the Secretary  of  State  to
    decide whether or not to invoke the flexibility policy not for a  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal to say that it should have been invoked  and
    that had it been, the Secretary of State would  have  been  obliged  to
    allow the appeal.

 9. I find that there is a material error of law in  the  determination  of
    the Judge in allowing the appeal and failing to properly apply  Section
    85A. In the circumstances I see no point in the  appeal  being  reheard
    but I shall remit the application to the Secretary of State so  that  a
    lawful decision including consideration of the  flexibility  policy  as
    set out in 245AA can be made.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted to the Secretary  of
State for reconsideration including a decision on the applicability  of  the
flexibility policy as set out in paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules.
