For the Appellant:     Ms Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in these proceedings is the Entry Clearance  Officer  who
    was the respondent before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  For  ease  of
    reference I refer to the parties as the Entry Clearance Officer and the
    claimant.  The claimant was born on 26th July, 1997 and is  a  national
    of Sierra Leone.   Her  father,  the  sponsor,  is  a  British  subject
    originally from Sierra Leone.  He appeared before me today and gave  me
    certain evidence, as a result of  which  I  am  able  to  prepare  this
    determination.

2.   The claimant made application in December 2013, when she was  16  years
    of age for entry clearance to settle with  her  father  in  the  United
    Kingdom. That application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer on
    7th March, 2014, as a result of which  the  claimant  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    S J Steer who, in a determination promulgated  on  15th  January  2015,
    allowed claimant's appeal.  The application had originally been refused
    by the Entry Clearance Officer with reference to Immigration  Rules  HC
    395 as amended because, first, it was not accepted that the sponsor was
    her father, that was on the basis of paragraph  297(1).   Alternatively
    that he had not sole responsibility for her.  That was on the basis  of
    paragraph 297(1)(e).   Further  in  the  alternative  that  there  were
    serious and compelling family or other  reasons  making  her  exclusion
    undesirable - paragraph 297(1)(e).   And lastly in any  event,  it  was
    said that he could not adequately  maintain  her  without  recourse  to
    public funds as required by paragraph 297(v).  The  judge  allowed  the
    appeal.

3.   There was no dispute between the parties that she was able to meet  the
    remaining requirements of the Immigration Rules.

4.   The sponsor gave oral evidence at  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and there was cross-examination  although  not  going  to  the
    issues of  his  credibility  and  submissions  were  made.   The  judge
    concluded that claimant met all the disputed requirements of  paragraph
    297 and allowed the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  judge
    refers to Article 8 of the European Convention for  the  Protection  of
    Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom, but did not  go  on  to  consider
    whether an adverse immigration decision resulted in a breach  of  human
    rights because, that was not of course necessary.

5.   The Entry Clearance Officer appealed, suggesting first that  the  judge
    had failed to apply the correct test set out in KA and Others (Adequacy
    of  maintenance)  Pakistan  [2006]  UKAIT  00065,  which   required   a
    comparator of income as at the date of decision, in this case 7th March
    2014, with the relevant  income  support  entitlement  in  addition  to
    housing costs, in this case rent and council tax, and  does  not  allow
    for reliance on third party support.

6.   Secondly, that the judge took into account  evidence  of  circumstances
    that did not appertain at the date of decision, namely the  release  of
    funds for the claimant's maintenance as a  result  of  another  of  the
    sponsor's children going to university contrary to Section  85  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

7.   Under Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act on appeal under Section  82(1)  and
    83 the Tribunal can consider evidence about any matter which it  thinks
    relevant to the substance of  the  decision  including  evidence  which
    concerns a matter arising after the date of decision.  However  Section
    85(4) of the 2002 Act is now subject to  the  exceptions  contained  in
    Section 85A which was brought into  force  by  Section  19  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2009.

8.   Pursuant to Exception 1 in appeals against refusal of  entry  clearance
    or a refusal of a Certificate  of  Entitlement  under  Section  10  the
    Tribunal "may consider only the circumstances pertaining at the time of
    decision".  It follows that evidence of matters  arising  post-decision
    cannot be considered in such cases but this  does  not  mean  that  any
    evidence post-decision cannot be considered.  There  is  a  distinction
    between post-decision evidence that "sheds light" on the  circumstances
    pertaining at the date of decision which remains admissible  under  the
    2002 Act and post-decision evidence relating  to  post-decision  events
    which is not admissible under the Act.

9.   The judge correctly self-directed at paragraph 21 of her decision  that
    the consideration was confined to evidence of the position as it was at
    the date of decision when she turned to deal with the question  of  the
    maintenance dispute at paragraph 27.

10.  The sponsor sought to rely on evidence of his pension  entitlement  and
    his wife's earnings totalling �1,200 per  month  and  evidence  of  his
    rental expenses of less than �8 a week in the context  of  his  pension
    credits as well as his current council tax charge. More  to  the  point
    that the relevant consideration of public funds set out  in  the  ECO's
    grounds of �177.62 plus housing costs were not met so that the  judge's
    conclusions were in fact supported by evidence.

11.  The matter came for hearing  before  the  Honourable  Mr  Justice  Edis
    sitting as a Judge of the Upper  Tribunal  and  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Davidge on 14th May 2015.  In  their  determination,  a  copy  of
    which is set out in the annex to this determination,  they  found  that
    the release of funds for maintaining the claimant through the sponsor's
    son going to university was a matter that arose after the decision.  It
    should not have admitted and the judge's reliance upon it was an  error
    of law.

12.  They make it clear that the starting point for the  judge  should  have
    been an  evaluation  of  the  oral  and  documentary  evidence  of  the
    financial position of the sponsor and his wife at 7th March, 2014 and a
    comparison of that position as against income  support  comparator  for
    the 7th March, 2014.  Only if  the  income  was  established  as  being
    sufficient as at 7th March, 2014 could the claimant's appeal under  the
    Rules have succeeded.

13.  The Tribunal sitting on 14th May, 2015 found an error of  law  in  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in respect  of  maintenance  at
    paragraph 297(5) revealed an error of law such that to that extent only
    the decision must be set aside.  They pointed out that the claimant was
    not  legally  represented  and  is  still  a   minor   and   in   those
    circumstances, so that the sponsor could understand the  importance  of
    the assessment being conducted as at 4th March, 2014, they  decided  to
    give their decision orally at the hearing and set out  in  brief  their
    reasons.  They annexed to their determination the oral reasons provided
    on the day.  They indicated to the parties  that  in  the  event  of  a
    finding  that  the  evidence  did  not  establish  that  the  financial
    requirements were met, the issue as  to  whether  or  not  the  adverse
    immigration decision resulted in a breach of Article 8 to  be  assessed
    at 7th March, 2014 remained open.

14.  At the end of the hearing the  sponsor  indicated  that  he  might  not
    prefer to proceed  with  this  appeal  but  instead  to  make  a  fresh
    application urgently before the claimant became 18 when different Rules
    would apply.  As it transpired, the claimant has pursued the appeal.

15.  In evidence before me  today  the  sponsor  has  established  that  his
    pension credit as at the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision
    was �118.38 per week.  He has also established in  evidence  before  me
    today that his wife was earning at least �107 per week as at  the  date
    of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision and, indeed, it may have been
    very slightly more.  He has further established before me today that in
    respect of his two other children he and his wife were  in  receipt  of
    tax credits of �111.12 per week and that his wife was  in  addition  in
    receipt of child benefit of �33.70 per week.

16.  On behalf of the respondent the Presenting Officer confirmed  that  she
    agreed those figures and, more importantly, accepted that  the  sponsor
    was in receipt at the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision of
    a sum in excess of �360 per week.  That is important because the figure
    set out in the original grounds of appeal at paragraph 6 is wron,g  but
    it is wrong in favour of the claimant.  It suggests  that  the  sponsor
    would need a weekly income of �112 for himself and his wife plus �65.62
    for a child, making a total of �171.62.  In fact he would need to  have
    had an income of �309.41 because he had two additional children and two
    further sums of �65.62 have to be added to the figure of  �177.62.   In
    other words, for the purposes of this  appeal  the  claimant  needs  to
    demonstrate that the sponsor's income is in excess of �309.41 as at 7th
    March and, as has been accepted by the Presenting Officer, the  sponsor
    has clearly demonstrated that this was the case, in fact his income was
    considerably in excess of  this  sum  as  at  the  date  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision.

Decision

17.  The Presenting Officer agreed with me that the right  course  would  be
    for this appeal to be allowed and I  allow  it  now.   A  copy  of  the
    determination of the Panel sitting on 14th May 2015 is  at  Appendix  I
    below.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms E Savage, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No Representative

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is not a full  reasoned  decision  on  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in  this  case.
    Full reasons will follow in writing.  Because  the  child  who  is  the
    appellant will reach her 18th birthday at the end  of  July  it  is  of
    importance that if this  appeal  ought  ultimately  to  succeed  it  is
    disposed of as quickly as it can be.  For that reason I am giving  this
    oral account of our decision to enable matters to proceed  after  today
    quickly.

2.   We have reached the clear conclusion that the decision of  Judge  Steer
    in the First-tier Tribunal  on  11  January  2015  cannot  stand.   Her
    assessment of means was based squarely on the fact that one of the  two
    children who had been living in  this  family  home  had  now  gone  to
    university so that the income which had been used to maintain him could
    hereafter be used to maintain the  appellant  if  she  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom.  That is a decision which was not open to  her  in  law
    because it relied upon evidence which concerned the  state  of  affairs
    after the decision was taken which is 7 March 2014 and that is  a  firm
    Rule which arises out of the terms of the Act which we cannot abrogate.

3.   Therefore, having set that decision aside, it is for this  Tribunal  in
    our judgment to remake the decision.  That  involves  as  far  as  this
    Tribunal is concerned  affording  the  sponsor  and  the  appellant  an
    opportunity to lodge whatever evidence they consider they  can  on  the
    questions which are going to determine the decision when it is  remade,
    and the questions which are going to determine the decision when it  is
    remade are first whether the means of  the  sponsor,  which  would,  we
    think, include those of his wife, were on 7 March  2014  sufficient  to
    provide adequate maintenance for the child so that she would  not  have
    to have recourse to public funds.

4.   That evidence could, given the age of this application, take a  variety
    of forms.  If, for example, as at 7 March 2014 Mr Tayyibbah expected on
    good grounds that he would shortly receive a pension even if it was not
    then in payment  that  would  be  evidence  which  the  Tribunal  could
    consider.  Whether it would be adequate would be  another  matter.   So
    therefore we consider that the appellant and the sponsor should have an
    opportunity to lodge  whatever  evidence  they  can  relating  to  that
    question: the means of the family as at 7 March 2014.  Secondly, on the
    assumption that the sponsor's means may turn out not  to  be  adequate,
    this is a case  in  our  judgment  where  there  would  have  to  be  a
    consideration of Article  8.   Article  8  involves  an  assessment  of
    whether the application of the Rules would be disproportionate  to  the
    effect that it would have on the appellant's family and private life.

5.   It is not obvious that there is any material which could bear  on  that
    question which we do not already have.  The  judge  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made findings of fact  which  are  not  challenged  and  which
    plainly are relevant to the Article 8 assessment even  though  she  did
    not herself carry out an Article 8 assessment.  However,  we  do  offer
    the opportunity to the appellant and her sponsor to  file  any  further
    evidence relevant to the Article 8 question but they must remember that
    this Tribunal will be considering the Article 8 question as it stood in
    March 2014 and not as it stands now.

6.   So what we propose to do is to set aside the  decision  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for reasons which we will give later.
