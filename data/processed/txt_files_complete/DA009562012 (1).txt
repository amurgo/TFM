                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination of a panel of the  First-
        tier  Tribunal  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  'the  Panel')   who
        dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the  decision  dated  2nd
        July  2012  to  deport  him  from  the  United  Kingdom  under  the
        provisions of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
        2006.


     2. The appellant is a Latvian national born on 26th  August  1965.  On
        18th June 2012 he  was  convicted  of  conspiracy  to  defraud  and
        sentenced to two years imprisonment.  The Sentencing Judge stated:


     You, Krumins, fall to be sentenced only in respect of count  6.  In  my
   judgment, you fall into a different category. On the evidence,  you  were
   less   involved. The value of the goods that you obtained was  just  over
   �60,000. I     take into account the pleas in your case and  the  limited
   involvement in      your case but  nonetheless,  there  must  be,  in  my
   judgment, an immediate  sentence of custody and the appropriate  term  in
   your case is two years'      imprisonment. You may sit down.


     3. The appellant was assessed in the NOMS report dated 31st July  2012
        as posing a low risk of serious harm in the future. It is noted  he
        has no previous convictions in the UK or abroad. What are stated to
        be other significant risk issues by the author of  the  report  are
        set out by the Panel in paragraph 31 of the determination, such  as
        his ability to network with others  and  what  is  described  as  a
        severe debt problem. The appellant is also stated to have  learning
        difficulties  which  may  indicate  he  may  remain  vulnerable  to
        manipulation by others for their own wider gain.


     4. In paragraph 55 the Panel note it is accepted the appellant has not
        resided in the United Kingdom in accordance  with  the  Regulations
        for a continuous period of over five years and he does not  have  a
        right of permanent residence. The Panel make the correct legal self
        direction in relation to the test to be applied which is the  lower
        level, namely that deportation is justified on  grounds  of  public
        policy or public security. In paragraphs 61 to 63 they state:


     61.  We have considered the appellants offending history as a guide  to
          his possible future conduct. We have  given  consideration  as  to
          whether the appellant has demonstrated a propensity  to  re-offend
     and whether he  represents  a  genuine  and  present  and  sufficiently
   serious threat to the public to justify his deportation. We find that  he
          has committed a serious criminal offence in the past  and  we  are
          persuaded that it has been established that he is a credible  risk
   of             further serious criminal activities.


     62.  We find the seriousness of the crime committed  by  the  appellant
   falls          within the crimes  featured  in  cases  like  Marchon  and
   Schmelz [2003]               EWCA Civ 29 where the Court of  Appeal  held
   that the deportation of               European  nationals  was  justified
   even in the absence of any                propensity  to  re-offend,  and
   which in any event pre-dates the 2006              Regulations.  We  find
   that the  appellant  does  represent  a  genuine,            present  and
   sufficiently    serious    threat    to     public     policy,     public
   security or public health such as to justify his deportation.


     63.  We find that this appellant is a European citizen  who  has  taken
          advantage of freedom of movement under  the  Treaty  to  re-locate
     from Latvia to the United Kingdom.   We  find  that  the  appellant  to
   have lawfully lived freely in the country [until his  detention]  and  as
     such the respondent needs to establish the test  for  his  removal.  We
     find that the appellant's actual risk on the grounds of public  policy,
          public  security  or  public  health  is  so  compelling  that  it
   justifies the           exceptional  course  of  removing  him  from  the
   United Kingdom. We           find that the respondent has established the
   appellant's conduct              satisfies the applicable  public  policy
   criterion for deportation of this             appellant.


     5. The appeal was therefore dismissed under the Regulations.



Discussion


Error of law finding


     6. The grounds seeking permission to appeal raise a number of  issues,
        one of which is that the Marchon case pre-dates the Regulations and
        so should not be relied upon.  In some cases the  fact  a  judgment
        pre-dates  subsequent  legislative  changes  is  not  determinative
        provided the legal principle upon which the decision in  the  older
        case is based remains good law.  It is correct that in both Marchon
        and R (Schmeiz) v IAT [2004]  EWCA  Civ  29  the  Court  of  Appeal
        indicated that the seriousness of the offence  may  itself  justify
        removal but this appears to be contrary to the provisions contained
        in the 2006 Regulations. This is  a  view  supported  by  the  case
        relied upon by the Panel in  paragraph  60  of  the  determination,
        Commission v the Netherlands Case C-50/06, in  which  the  European
        Court of Justice clearly were of the  opinion  that  the  evidence,
        including that of past criminality, must establish a future risk to
        society for any removal to be justified. I find the panel failed to
        examine this element of the case in sufficient detail and the  fact
        they appear to have believed the seriousness of the  offence  alone
        may justify deportation is arguable wrong in law, without more.


     7. I accept that the Panel do say in the  above  paragraphs  that  the
        appellant  does  represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
        serious threat but fail to adequately explain why.


     8. In relation to the other factors identified in the NOMS report, and
        paragraph 31  of  the  determination,  Mr  Vokes  referred  to  the
        appellant's witness statement in which he says he was only �800  in
        debt. This is not substantial. Mrs Heath was unable to refer me  to
        any evidence supporting the claim his debts were  substantial.  The
        Panel failed to make specific findings on this issue to  justify  a
        conclusion the burden or proving the necessary degree of  risk  was
        met. In relation to the claim the fraudulent operation could  start
        up at any time; this is theoretically correct  but  the  co-accused
        who had greater culpability and received longer sentences are still
        in prison and may be deported themselves. The fact something  could
        happen does not necessarily mean it  will.   The  Panel  failed  to
        analyse this issue and give adequate findings for  what  must  have
        been their conclusion that the appellant will offend again  in  the
        future.  The assessment of reoffending  was  low  with  a  6%  risk
        within one year and 12% within two years in the NOMS report.


     9. I find the Panel have erred in law such that the determination must
        be set aside in (a) failing to apply the correct  legal  test  when
        indicating the offence in isolation could justify  deportation  and
        (b) failing to make findings on material matters and in failing  to
        give adequate reasons for their finding the required test was  met,
        based upon the issue of any future risk to society.


   Remaking the decision


    10. The facts are  agreed  and  preserved.  I  proceed  to  remake  the
        decision by allowing the appeal under the EEA Regulations.


    11. In MG and VC (Ireland) [2006] UKAIT 00053 the  Tribunal  held  that
        the propensity to re-offend was crucial. This accords with the view
        of the ECJ in Commission v Netherlands.   The  appellant  has  been
        assessed as posing a low risk of harm in the  future,  it  has  not
        been proved by the  respondent  that  his  financial  situation  is
        serious at as at the date of the hearing such as  to  give  him  an
        overwhelming motive to  commit  further  offences,  the  sentencing
        judge clearly found  the  appellant  less  culpable  than  his  co-
        accused, and there is no evidence his intellectual  abilities  mean
        there is a likelihood he will offend again. Even if mislead in  the
        past  he  has  been  in  prison  and  must  be  aware  that  future
        criminality will increase the risk of his deportation.


    12. The burden is upon the respondent to prove the  necessary  test  is
        met.   On  the  facts  of  this  case  this  burden  has  not  been
        discharged. Mrs Heath relied upon the refusal letters but could not
        say much more.  I find it has not been  shown  that  the  appellant
        represents a future threat to society on the evidence  and  so,  on
        this basis and the fact that without such  a  finding  his  removal
        cannot be proportionate under EU law, the appeal must be allowed.


Decision

    13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is allowed.


   Anonymity.


    14. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.
