For the Appellant:     Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The claimant is a national of Sudan born on 1st January 1986.   On  1st
    March 2013 she applied for entry clearance as a family member of an EEA
    national, namely her husband  Mr  Mohamed  Elfaki.   He  is  a  British
    national.

2.   The application was refused on 30th April 2013 because her sponsor,  as
    a British citizen, was not exercising treaty rights.

3.   The sponsor himself was originally from the Sudan but obtained  British
    nationality in 1998 on the basis of his marriage  to  his  first  wife.
    Since 2007 he has been working as a chef in a local hotel.   He  has  a
    daughter by the first  marriage  but  there  are  no  children  to  the
    marriage that he has with the claimant.

4.   The claimant sought to appeal against the  refusal  which  appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly on 8th May 2014.

5.   The Judge did not find that the EEA Regulations were engaged.

6.   As to the Immigration Rules it was noted that  a  previous  application
    for entry clearance had been refused under paragraph 320(7B).   In  any
    event the earnings of the sponsor were less than the ï¿½18,600 which  was
    required under the Rules.

7.   The Judge went on, however, to consider matters under Article 8 and  in
    particular noted in relation to proportionality the comments made by Mr
    Justice Blake in MM, R (On the Application Of) v The Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) that the imposition of
    such a high financial threshold  was  unfair  and  disproportionate  in
    terms of human rights.  It is clear from paragraph 32 that that comment
    was a determinative influence in the decision by the Judge to allow the
    appeal in respect of Article 8 of the ECHR.

8.   The Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  sought  to  appeal
    against that decision on  the  basis  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    identify any compelling circumstances over and  above  the  Immigration
    Rules to justify the decision.

9.   Permission to appeal was granted on that basis.  Thus the  matter  came
    before me in pursuance of that permission.

10.  Events have moved on to a significant extent in that  the  decision  of
    Mr Justice Blake as set out in paragraph 22 of  the  determination  was
    considered by the Court of Appeal in MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ  985.
    In essence the approach taken by Mr Justice Blake did not  find  favour
    with the Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal held that the  Secretary
    of State and Parliament were entitled to set a particular  standard  of
    earnings in all the circumstances and that to do so was not  in  breach
    of  fundamental  human  rights.   Mr  Holiwood,  who   represents   the
    appellant, conceded most fairly at the outset that the Court of  Appeal
    decision in MM (Lebanon), although made subsequent to the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge, nevertheless reflected a change  in  the
    approach to  be  taken  to  the  Immigration  Rules  and  fundamentally
    undermined the reasoning of Mr Justice Blake at first instance.   Given
    that the findings in relation to Article 8 were essentially  predicated
    on that basis it was conceded that the decision was wrong  in  law  and
    could not stand.

11.  It was somewhat of a grey area in any  event,  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was entitled to embark upon a consideration of Article 8
    in an application made under the EEA  Regulations.   It  was  conceded,
    however, once again by those who represented  the  claimant,  that  the
    refusal of entry clearance purported to deal with matters also  on  the
    basis of Article 8 and as such  therefore  it  was  legitimate  for  an
    appeal to be lodged upon that basis.  It was not  considered  therefore
    that a formal fresh application in respect of Article 8  was  required.
    It was at any event important in that context to  consider  the  nature
    and effect of 320(7B) and whether that should continue to be applied in
    all the circumstances.

12.   There would need to be evidence and  legal  argument  in  relation  to
    what were the compelling circumstances of the claimant and  whether  or
    not he should continue to be excluded from the United Kingdom. In those
    circumstances, in pursuance of paragraph 7 of  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Direction, it was conceded that the decision should be quashed
    and set aside to be remade  by  a  differently  constituted  First-tier
    Tribunal.

13.  I do not set out any detailed directions at this  time  other  than  to
    indicate that if further evidence is to be provided as  to  family  and
    private life and/or compelling circumstances such should be  served  no
    later than seven working days prior to the new hearing.

Decision

The appeal by the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  is  allowed.
There will be a reconsideration of Article 8 and related issues  before  the
First-tier Tribunal.
