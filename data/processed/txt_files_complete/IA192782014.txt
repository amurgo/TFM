                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India, born on 14 December  1984.   On  6
    June 2015 he arrived with leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General)  Student
    Migrant which on 10 December 2013 the Respondent curtailed with  effect
    from 8 February 2014 on the  grounds  that  the  Appellant  had  ceased
    studying at  the  institution  which  had  issued  his  Certificate  of
    Acceptance for  Studies  (CAS).   In  time,  on  8  February  2013  the
    Appellant made a further application for leave  in  the  same  capacity
    which on 4 April 2014 the Respondent refused.

The Original Decision

 2. The Respondent refused the application for further leave  on  the  sole
    ground that at the date of the decision, 4 April 2014, the CAS Tracking
    Service did not  disclose  that  any  CAS  had  been  assigned  to  the
    Appellant.  The  application  was  therefore  refused  under  paragraph
    245ZX(c) of the Immigration Rules and para.117 of Appendix A.

 3. On 28 April 2014 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal under Section 82
    of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as  amended
    referring to the issue of a CAS to him by London  Metropolitan  College
    (LMC) and attaching a letter from LMC confirming that a valid  CAS  was
    extant and assigned to him as at 4 April 2014.

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

 4. On 30 September 2014 the Appellant wrote  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    with a witness statement and a bundle of documents stating he would not
    be able to attend the hearing because  he  was  unwell  and  could  not
    afford to pay for a representative.

 5. The appeal was decided by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Seifert  on
    the papers and on 8 December 2014 her decision  dismissing  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules was promulgated.

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal, referring to the  letter  of
    25 April 2014 which he had submitted  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    consideration of his appeal and asserting that the  decision  contained
    an error of law because it had failed to take this letter into account.

 7. On 29 January 2015 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pooler  granted
    permission to appeal on the basis it was arguable there was no evidence
    to support the Respondent's assertion about absence of any CAS and  the
    Judge had not taken into account other evidence which I take to include
    the letter of 25 April from LMC confirming the continuing  validity  of
    the Appellant's CAS.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 8. The Appellant attended the hearing for the limited purpose of which  he
    had instructed Ms Qureshi.  Because of the havoc caused by  the  recent
    underground electrical fire in the Kingsway area  Mr  Tarlow  had  some
    papers but did not have the Respondent's file.   He  had  received  the
    Appellant's bundle which had been filed with the Upper Tribunal  on  11
    March 2015.



 9. I explained the procedure and the purpose of the hearing and  that  the
    initial task was to ascertain whether or not there was a material error
    of law in the Judge's decision.  Following a conversation  between  the
    representatives and myself it was agreed that  the  hearing,  to  begin
    with, should proceed by way of my setting out what I considered  to  be
    the chronology of events  and  I  requested  that  the  representatives
    interrupt me if they thought I was in error.  In the event  I  set  out
    what I considered to be the chronology and neither  representative  saw
    the need to intervene.

10. The chronology is as follows:-

         8 February 2014.  Following receipt of the Respondent's decision to
         curtail his then leave, the Appellant made further application  for
         student leave supported by a CAS from London  College  of  Business
         Management and Information Technology.

         26 February 2014.  LMC issued a CAS to the Appellant for a one year
         course.

         26 February 2014.  The Appellant wrote to the Respondent  with  the
         balance of documentation which he had omitted from his  8  February
         application and  which  the  Respondent  had  requested.   In  that
         letter, the Appellant sought to vary his application to enable  him
         to study at LMC.  With the letter he submitted the  CAS  issued  by
         LMC.

         4 April 2014.  The Respondent makes  a  CAS  check.   There  is  no
         evidence in the Tribunal file as to the nature of the  check  other
         than the Respondent's assertion the result was wholly negative.

         4 April 2014.  The Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application
         for lack of a valid CAS.

         25 April 2014.  LMC confirmed the Appellant had an extant CAS as at
         4 April 2014.

         28 April 2014.  The Appellant lodges notice of appeal.

         8 December 2014.  The First-tier Tribunal dismiss  the  Appellant's
         appeal.

11. I pointed out that the First-tier Tribunal had at paragraph 18  of  its
    decision accepted the Appellant had sent the CAS issued by LMC  to  the
    Respondent with his letter of 26 February 2014.  At paragraph 20 of the
    Judge's decision she had referred to the Respondent's assertion that  a
    check on 4 April 2014 failed to disclose a valid CAS for the  Appellant
    and on that basis dismissed the appeal at paragraph 22 of her  decision
    without reference to the letter of 25 April 2014  from  LMC  which  was
    before her.

12. I said to the representatives that unless they wished to submit to  the
    contrary, I proposed to find there was a material error of law  in  the
    Judge's decision because she had failed to  take  account  of  material
    evidence, namely LMC's letter of 25  April  2014  and  that  error  was
    sufficiently material to set aside her decision.  I proposed to re-make
    the decision allowing the appeal.  It  appeared  that  the  Appellant's
    letter of 26 February 2014 as varying the application for further leave
    by way of reference to studies at a different college had  not  reached
    or been noted by the caseworker.  There had been no challenge to  LMC's
    letter of 25 April 2014.  Consequently I considered it  appropriate  to
    re-make the decision allowing the appeal.

13. Neither representative had any submissions  to  make  or  objection  to
    proceeding on that basis.

Conclusion

14. Having regard to the chronology outlined and agreed by the parties  and
    for the reasons already stated I find the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal contains a material error of  law  such  that  its  conclusion
    should be  set  aside  but  its  findings  of  fact  in  particular  at
    paragraphs 17 and 18 should stand and I re-make the  decision  allowing
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

15. There was no request for an anonymity direction and I see no reason  to
    make one.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
    is set aside.  The decision is re-made and the appeal of the  Appellant
    is allowed.

    Anonymity direction not made.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

The appeal has been allowed and so I have considered whether to make  a  fee
award.  In the circumstances outlined in the body of the  decision,  I  find
it appropriate to make a fee award of ï¿½140.
