Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kamal of Immigration Solutions Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr R Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellants appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Coleman) dismissing the appellants' appeal  against  a  decision
    taken on 3 June 2014 to refuse to grant further leave to remain in  the
    UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and Tier 1 dependant and  to  remove  the
    appellants from the UK by way of directions.

Introduction

 3. The appellants first entered the UK on 10  September  2010;  the  first
    appellant having leave as a Tier 4 student until 30  January  2012  and
    subsequently as a Tier 1 (post study) migrant until 14 April 2014.  The
    second  appellant  has  been  his  dependent  throughout.  The  current
    application was made on 14 April 2014. The first appellant indicated in
    his  application  that  he  was  investing  �52,400  in  his  business;
    Kapotaksa Ltd ("the company"). Bank  evidence,  company  documents,  an
    accountant's letter and  accounts  plus  a  share  certificate  showing
    52,400 shares of the nominal value of �1  in  the  name  of  the  first
    appellant were all submitted with the application. The first  appellant
    was interviewed in relation to his application.

 4. The respondent refused the applications under paragraph 245DD(h) of the
    Immigration Rules ("the Rules") on the basis that she was not satisfied
    that the first appellant genuinely intended to establish or take over a
    business, intended to invest �50,000 in the  business  as  required  in
    Table 4 of Appendix A, that the money required was in  the  appellant's
    possession or in the financial accounts of the  business  or  available
    from a third party named in the application and that the appellant  did
    not intend to take employment in  the  UK  other  than  that  permitted
    within the Rules.

 5. The first appellant stated in interview that he had saved �40,000  from
    working in the UK  and  had  borrowed  �10,000  from  his  father.  The
    respondent decided that the appellant's answers were contradictory  and
    did not set out the exact amount borrowed or saved or where  the  money
    came from in the first place. There were no  bank  statements  to  show
    that the first appellant accrued the money to spend  on  the  business.
    Other factors also caused concern (no evidence to support existence  of
    claimed  employees,  no  evidence  of  market  research,  very   little
    advertising, only one contract for work, no evidence of claimed �14,000
    expenditure on subcontractors, previous educational experience did  not
    show sufficiently substantial experience to run  a  business)  and  the
    required points were not awarded under paragraph 245DD(k)  because  the
    respondent was not satisfied about the genuineness of the application.

The Appeal

 6. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an oral
    hearing at Taylor House on 12 January 2015. They were represented by Mr
    Kamal. The First-tier Tribunal  found  that  the  first  appellant  had
    simply failed to produce any evidence whatsoever to prove on a  balance
    of probability that he at any time had in excess of �50,000 or that the
    sum was invested in the company. The first appellant had failed to show
    that he came within the Rules and dismissing his appeal meant that  the
    appeal of the second appellant must also fail.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  3
    February 2015 on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in
    law. The judge had made a series of errors and the first appellant  had
    demonstrated all of the necessary documents as  proof  of  his  genuine
    business. He had invested not less than �52,400 in the company, a large
    amount of which was spent on subcontracting. The funds came partly from
    his own savings and the remainder from his family and friends in the UK
    and Pakistan. Any deficiencies  in  the  application  could  have  been
    remedied if the  respondent  had  applied  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin  on
    17 March 2015. The judge had failed to consider the  appeals  on  human
    rights grounds despite Article 8 being raised as a  ground  of  appeal.
    The judge had also failed to consider paragraph 245AA of the Rules even
    though evidential flexibility was raised in the grounds  of  appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal. The remainder of the grounds had  no  arguable
    merit as they constituted no more than a disagreement with the  judge's
    findings.

 9. In a rule 24 response dated 26 March 2015, the respondent  stated  that
    the judge made sustainable and reasoned findings to dismiss the appeal.
    The judge did not make any Article  8  findings  but  that  was  not  a
    material error of law because the grounds do not explain how  it  would
    be disproportionate to remove the appellants.

10. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

11. Mr Kamal submitted that it is clear that  the  application  was  purely
    refused on the genuineness test. No points were  awarded  for  finance.
    Despite the clear documentary evidence, the refusal  letter  says  that
    the  respondent  was  not  satisfied  about  the  genuineness  of   the
    application. The business is running and it is a genuine business.  The
    interviewer could have asked for further documents such  as  pay  slips
    and bank evidence. There is  no  mention  of  paragraph  245AA  in  the
    decision. Not considering evidential flexibility  was  a  legal  error.
    Article 8 was also not mentioned. The first  appellant  has  a  masters
    degree and lives with his wife. He has invested �52,000 in his business
    and has a legitimate expectation that he can live and work in  the  UK.
    He has the education and training but that was not  considered  in  the
    decision.

12. Mr Whitwell submitted that the issue is whether the judge erred in  her
    approach. There are examples of the application of paragraph  245AA  at
    pages 30-31 of the appellants' bundle for the Upper Tribunal.  In  this
    case the first appellant did not persuade the decision maker and  there
    was no requirement to ask for additional documents. Any  new  documents
    are still  not  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  there  has  been  no
    application to adduce further evidence. Paragraph 12  of  the  decision
    shows the judge's approach and it is not apparent  that  there  is  any
    documentation that could assist the appellants. Even if the  respondent
    had written to the first appellant it is not clear that it  would  have
    made any difference to the application. Article 8 was  raised  and  not
    determined but the appellants could not succeed  under  Article  8  and
    there is an issue of materiality. The first appellant failed  to  prove
    that �50,000 had been invested and there was no legitimate  expectation
    to succeed under Article 8 given  the  failure  under  the  Rules.  The
    purpose of entry had been completed.

13. Mr Kamal replied  that  the  first  appellant  is  the  director  of  a
    business. The  appellant  submitted  all  of  the  documents  with  his
    application under paragraph 245DD(i) and was called  in  to  interview.
    Nothing else was asked of him.

14. I find that this appeal has a relatively narrow compass. It  is  common
    ground that the judge failed to  consider  evidential  flexibility  and
    Article 8 even though both matters featured in the grounds of appeal to
    the First-tier Tribunal. The real issue is materiality.

15. I have considered evidential flexibility in the context of the Court of
    Appeal decision in Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2. There is no  obligation
    on the respondent to make speculative enquiries.  The  judge  found  at
    paragraph 20 of the decision that the first  appellant  had  failed  to
    prove that he had at any time in excess of  �50,000  or  that  sum  was
    invested in the company. Those findings were properly open to the judge
    and it is difficult to see how any First-tier judge could have  reached
    a different conclusion. In those circumstances there was no prospect of
    evidential  flexibility  assisting  the  first  appellant.   There   is
    certainly nothing in paragraph 245AA that could justify or require  any
    request for further evidence from  the  first  appellant.  No  material
    error of law arises.

16. I have considered Nasim and Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025  (IAC)
    in relation to Article 8. The following paragraphs are relevant;

         "10.  Mr  Jarvis's  stance,  on  behalf  of  the  respondent,   was
             uncompromising.   In  the  respondent's  view,  none  of   the
             appellants could demonstrate that removal in pursuance of  the
             decision to refuse to vary leave would have  "consequences  of
             such gravity" as to engage Article 8(1) of the ECHR;  that  is
             to say, none could demand a positive answer to the  second  of
             the five questions posed by Lord Bingham in Razgar v Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27,  at  [17][1],
             with the result that it was unnecessary to  determine  whether
             such removal constituted a disproportionate interference  with
             Article 8 rights.

         11.  In this regard, Mr Jarvis placed particular emphasis upon  the
             following part of the judgment of Lord Carnwath in  Patel  and
             Others v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2013]
             UKSC 72:-

                  "57. It is important to remember that article 8 is  not  a
                      general dispensing power. It is to  be  distinguished
                      from the Secretary of  State's  discretion  to  allow
                      leave to remain  outside  the  rules,  which  may  be
                      unrelated to any protected human right. The merits of
                      a decision not to  depart  from  the  rules  are  not
                      reviewable  on  appeal:  section   86(6).   One   may
                      sympathise with  Sedley  LJ's  call  in  Pankina  for
                      'common sense' in the application  of  the  rules  to
                      graduates who have been studying in the UK  for  some
                      years ... However,  such  considerations  do  not  by
                      themselves provide grounds of appeal under article 8,
                      which is concerned with private or family  life,  not
                      education as such. The opportunity  for  a  promising
                      student to  complete  his  course  in  this  country,
                      however desirable in general terms, is not in  itself
                      a right protected under article 8."

         12.   In  her  submissions,  Mrs  Heybroek,  upon  whom  the  other
             representatives substantially relied as regards  their  common
             Article 8 arguments, contended that,  in  this  passage,  Lord
             Carnwath was doing no more than pointing out that a  right  to
             education is not per se covered by Article 8.  We  regard  the
             passage, however, as having a wider import, in seeking to  re-
             focus attention upon the core purposes of Article 8.

         13.  In order to explain why,  the  following  passage  from  Human
             Rights Law and Practice, 3rd Edition 2009 (Lester, Pannick and
             Herberg, Eds), under the heading "the scope of the right",  is
             instructive:-

                  "Of all of the Convention rights, art 8  has  by  far  the
                  widest  scope.   Like  other  international  human  rights
                  guarantees, it  demands  respect  for  a  broad  range  of
                  loosely allied  personal  interests:  physical  or  bodily
                  integrity; personal identity and lifestyle  (at  least  in
                  some   respects),   including   sexuality    and    sexual
                  orientation; reputation; family life; the  home  and  home
                  environment; and correspondence, embracing  all  forms  of
                  communication.  It is this breadth that has led to  art  8
                  being described as 'the least defined and most unruly'  of
                  the Convention rights.   As  regards  private  life,  Lord
                  Rodger observed in the Countryside Alliance case that 'the
                  European Human Rights Commission  long  ago  rejected  any
                  Anglo-Saxon notion that the right to respect  for  private
                  life was to be equated with the right  to  privacy'.   The
                  closest to a unifying theme for such diverse  subjects  is
                  the liberal presumption that individuals  should  have  an
                  area of autonomous development, interaction and liberty, a
                  'private sphere', with or without interaction with  others
                  free from state  intervention  and  free  from  excessive,
                  unsolicited intervention by other  uninvited  individuals.
                  Thus, the notion of privacy is a continuum, starting  from
                  an inviolable core  of  personal  autonomy  in  a  private
                  context and radiating out (yet becoming  more  subject  to
                  qualification or justified interference) into personal and
                  social relationships in the wider world."

         14.  Whilst the concept of a "family life"  is  generally  speaking
             readily identifiable, the concept of a "private life" for  the
             purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of
             the "continuum" stands  the  concept  of  moral  and  physical
             integrity  or  "physical  and  psychological  integrity"   (as
             categorised by the ECtHR in eg Pretty v United Kingdom  (2002)
             35 EHRR 1) as to which, in extreme instances, even the state's
             interest in removing foreign criminals might not constitute  a
             proportionate  response.   However,  as  one  moves  down  the
             continuum, one encounters aspects of private life which,  even
             if engaging Article 8(1) (if not alone,  then  in  combination
             with other factors) are so far  removed  from  the  "core"  of
             Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state interests, such
             as the importance  of  maintaining  a  credible  and  coherent
             system of immigration control.

         15.  At this point on the continuum the essential elements  of  the
             private life relied upon will normally be transposable, in the
             sense of being  capable  of  replication  in  their  essential
             respects, following a person's return to their  home  country.
             Thus, in headnote 3 of MM (Tier 1 PSW; Art  8;  private  life)
             Zimbabwe [2009] UKAIT 0037 we find that:-

                  "3.  When determining the issue of proportionality ...  it
                      will always be important to evaluate  the  extent  of
                      the individual's social ties and relationships in the
                      UK.  However, a student here on a temporary basis has
                      no expectation of a  right  to  remain  in  order  to
                      further these ties and relationships if the  criteria
                      of the points-based system are not  met.   Also,  the
                      character of an individual's  "private  life"  relied
                      upon is ordinarily by its very nature of a type which
                      can be formed  elsewhere,  albeit  through  different
                      social ties, after the individual is removed from the
                      UK."...

         20.  We therefore agree with Mr  Jarvis  that  [57]  of  Patel  and
             Others is a significant exhortation from the Supreme Court  to
             re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of Article 8 and,
             in  particular,  to  recognise  its  limited  utility  to   an
             individual where one has moved along the continuum, from  that
             Article's  core  area  of  operation  towards  what  might  be
             described as its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation  arises,  both
             from what will at that point normally be the tangential effect
             on the individual of the proposed interference  and  from  the
             fact that, unless there are particular reasons to  reduce  the
             public  interest  of  enforcing  immigration  controls,   that
             interest   will   consequently   prevail   in   striking   the
             proportionality balance (even assuming that stage is reached).

         21.  In conclusion on this first general matter, we find  that  the
             nature of the right asserted by each of the appellants,  based
             on their desire, as former students, to undertake a period  of
             post-study work in the  United  Kingdom,  lies  at  the  outer
             reaches of cases requiring an affirmative answer to the second
             of the five "Razgar" questions  and  that,  even  if  such  an
             affirmative  answer  needs  to  be   given,   the   issue   of
             proportionality is to be resolved decisively in favour of  the
             respondent, by reference to her functions as the  guardian  of
             the system  of  immigration  controls,  entrusted  to  her  by
             Parliament...

         25.  A further seam running through the appellant's submissions was
             that, during their time in the United Kingdom, they  had  been
             law-abiding,  had  not  relied  on  public   funds   and   had
             contributed to the United  Kingdom  economy  by  paying  their
             students' fees.  Their aim  was  now  to  contribute  to  that
             economy by working.

         26.  We do not consider that this  set  of  submissions  takes  the
             appellants' cases anywhere.  It cannot rationally be contended
             that their Article 8 rights have  been  made  stronger  merely
             because, during their time in  this  country,  they  have  not
             sought public funds, have refrained from  committing  criminal
             offences and have paid the fees required in order to undertake
             their  courses.   Similarly,  a  desire  to   undertake   paid
             employment in the United Kingdom is not,  as  such,  a  matter
             that can enhance a person's right to remain here  in  reliance
             on Article 8.

         27.  The only significance of not having criminal  convictions  and
             not  having  relied  on  public  funds  is  to  preclude   the
             respondent from pointing to any public interest in respect  of
             the appellants' removal, over and above the  basic  importance
             of maintaining a  firm  and  coherent  system  of  immigration
             control.  However, for reasons we have already enunciated,  as
             a general matter  that  public  interest  factor  is,  in  the
             circumstances of these cases, more  than  adequate  to  render
             removal proportionate...

         29.  In Nasim and Others legitimate  expectation  was  amongst  the
             submissions deployed by the appellants  and  rejected  by  the
             Tribunal: [31] to [37].  We heard  nothing  on  19th  December
             that might even begin to cause us to resile from our  findings
             on this issue.  What the present submissions amount  to  is  a
             contention that Article 8 entitles an immigrant to compel  the
             respondent to continue to apply to that person the Immigration
             Rules which were in force when the immigrant was granted leave
             to  enter  the  United  Kingdom,  or  when  he  or   she   was
             subsequently granted leave  to  remain.   This  submission  is
             misconceived.  It finds no sanction in any case law  to  which
             our attention has been drawn.  As Mr Jarvis pointed out in his
             oral submissions, a number of the present  appellants  arrived
             in the United Kingdom  as  students,  before  the  Immigration
             Rules even contained the provisions concerning Tier  1  (Post-
             Study Work).  Although the  present  appellants  did  not,  of
             course, succeed by reference to those provisions,  others  who
             applied  earlier  would  have  been  able   to   satisfy   the
             requirements, and go on to  undertake  post-study  work,  even
             though the Rules in force on their admission  did  not  permit
             this.  In other words, absent a legitimate  expectation,  such
             as occurred in the case of highly skilled migrants,  the  fact
             that one must take the Immigration Rules  as  one  finds  them
             cuts both ways.  In any event, the essential point is that the
             ECHR does  not  have  the  effect  for  which  the  appellants
             contend."

17. In this appeal, the first appellant wishes to work in the  UK.  I  find
    that he has no legitimate expectation to do  so  unless  he  meets  the
    requirements of the Rules. The appellants do not have  any  convictions
    but that does not improve their position because the respondent accepts
    that they are individuals of good character. They have only been in the
    UK since 2010 and do not  meet  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. There are no compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances such as to justify further  consideration  of  Article  8
    outside the Rules. Even if the Razgar test  is  applied  in  full,  the
    public interest factor in maintaining a firm  and  coherent  system  of
    immigration  control  is   more   than   enough   to   render   removal
    proportionate.

18. I therefore find that the  appellant's  appeals  cannot  succeed  under
    Article 8. I accept that the appellants are entitled to a  decision  in
    relation to their Article 8 clams and remake the decision of the First-
    tier accordingly.

Decision

19. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    remake the decision as follows;

      i) I dismiss the appeals under the Immigration Rules.

     ii) I dismiss the appeals under Article 8.

-----------------------
[1] The questions are:
(1) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority  with
the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for his private or (as  the
case may be) family life?
(2) If so, will such interference  have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as
potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?
(3) If so, will such interference be in accordance with the law?
(4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic  society  in  the
interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being  of
the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection  of
health or morals, or for the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  of
others?
(5) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate  public  end
sought to be achieved?
