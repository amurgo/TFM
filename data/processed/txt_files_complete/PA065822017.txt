Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms V Easty, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq who appealed against a  decision  of
    the  Respondent  refusing  to  grant  him   asylum   and   humanitarian
    protection. His appeal was heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Martins who, in a decision promulgated on 22 September 2017,  dismissed
    it.

 2. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Pickup in a decision dated  16  November  2017.
    His reasons for so doing were:-

         "1.  The Appellant seeks permission to appeal, (in time) against  a
             decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Martins) who, in  a
             decision and reasons promulgated  on  22.9.17,  dismissed  his
             appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to reject his
             protection claim.

         2.   It is arguable that the reasons are inadequate. In  particular
             it is arguable that the risk on return arising from  cessation
             to practice Islam and at that the availability  of  relocation
             to the IKR have not been properly addressed. All  grounds  may
             be argued."

 3. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 4. At the outset I asked Ms Everett if she was able  to  take  me  in  the
    decision to where the Judge had dealt with the  issues  raised  in  the
    grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal,  made  findings  thereon  and
    provided adequate reasons for rejecting the account as detailed in  the
    first of Ms Easty's grounds of appeal. Ms Everett, professionally in my
    view, indicated that she was unable to  do  so  and  that  it  was  now
    accepted that this was an inadequately reasoned decision as asserted in
    the grounds seeking permission to appeal.

 5. That is an analysis I share.

 6. In light of  it  both  representatives  invited  me  to  conclude  that
    findings needed to be made on  several  issues  and  that  the  current
    decision could not stand and that the appeal should be remitted to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 7. Again that is an analysis that I share.

 8. For the reasons put forward in the grounds seeking permission to appeal
    I find that not only have issues between the  parties  not  been  dealt
    with by the Judge but that the  Judge  has  also  materially  erred  by
    inadequately reasoning her conclusion.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The decision is  set  aside.  The  appeal  is
remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be  dealt  with  afresh  pursuant  to
Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunal's, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007  and
Practice Direction 7.(b) before any Judge  aside from Judge Martins.


No anonymity direction is made.



Signed                              Date 26 January 2018.


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Appleyard
