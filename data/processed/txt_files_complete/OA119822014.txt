                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Brunnen sitting at  Manchester  on  25  June
    2015) whereby he dismissed, on financial grounds under the Rules and on
    Article 8 grounds outside the Rules, the appellant's appeal against the
    decision of an Entry Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance as
    a child under the age of 18 for the purposes  of  settlement  with  her
    mother, who is present and settled here.  The First-tier Tribunal  made
    an anonymity direction in favour of the appellant  on  account  of  her
    being a minor, and  I  consider  it  is  appropriate  that  she  should
    continue to be accorded anonymity for these proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 16  December  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Keane  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reasons:

    2.   The judge was concerned with appeal against a decision made by  an
         Entry Clearance Officer.  The appellant was aged  twelve  years  at
         the date when the Entry Clearance Officer made his or her decision.
          However, if paragraph  62  of  the  judge's  most  meticulous  and
         comprehensive decision is read  with  care  he  observed  that  the
         appellant was now aged  thirteen  years  and  the  judge  may  have
         considered the applicability of the relevant Immigration Rules  and
         to have resolved the Article 8 issue with that age in mind and  not
         the appellant's age at  the  date  when  the  respondent  made  the
         decision under appeal.

    3.   Arguably the judge's decision might have been different if he  had
         considered the appellant as a twelve year old girl  and  not  as  a
         thirteen year old  girl.   The  judge's  arguable  error  may  have
         permeated his reasoning as a whole and but  for  such  an  arguable
         error of law the judge might have arrived at a different  decision.



The Rule 24 Response

 3. On 29 December 2015 John  Parkinson  of  the  Specialist  Appeals  Team
    settled a Rule  24  response  opposing  the  appeal.   In  summary,  he
    submitted that the  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  directed
    himself appropriately.  He noted at paragraph [53] that no  submissions
    were made in respect of Article 8, although  the  claim  had  not  been
    expressly abandoned.  The judge had considered  the  relevance  of  the
    appellant's age in respect of her need for support, given  the  medical
    condition of the sponsor's mother as outlined at  paragraphs  [60]  and
    [61].  The judge was clearly considering the support that the appellant
    required in the light of the issues raised.  It was absurd  to  suggest
    that an appellant who was 12� years old at the date of decision was  in
    any way materially less competent than one who was aged 13.  Any  error
    was simply not material, and the determination of  the  judge  was  not
    damaged to any significant degree.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 4. At the hearing before me, Mr Thornhill took  me  through  the  relevant
    chronology.  The appellant's date of birth was 9  February  2002.   The
    date of application was 4 July 2014, and the date of  decision  was  28
    August 2014.  He agreed that the appellant was 12�  years  old  at  the
    date of decision.  The date of the hearing  before  Judge  Brunnen  was
    nearly a year later.

 5. He submitted that the judge's error in referring to her age at the date
    of the hearing, as opposed to her age at  the  date  of  decision,  was
    material as the sponsor had given evidence  in  her  witness  statement
    about a visit to Vietnam in the summer of 2014 when she had  been  able
    to discuss with her  daughter  the  sensitive  topic  of  her  daughter
    entering puberty, whereas her daughter was not willing to discuss  this
    topic with her grandmother (the sponsor's mother).  He referred  me  to
    paragraph 6 of the witness statement made by the partner of the sponsor
    in the UK who said that he spoke frequently to  the  appellant  on  the
    telephone, and it was clear to him  that  she  was  missing  day-to-day
    contact with her parents.

 6. With regard to the financial requirements, he submitted that this  case
    was as a near miss as you could ever get.  The  financial  requirements
    were in fact met, but the evidence relating to the  partner's  earnings
    was in the wrong format.

 7. Mr Thornhill referred me to Mundeba [2013] UKUT  88  on  the  topic  of
    Section 55 and paragraph 297(i)(f) of the Rules.

 8. Mr Harrison adopted the Rule 24 response settled by his colleague,  and
    maintained that no material error was made out.

Discussion

 9. The source of the judge's error can be traced back to  the  refusal  of
    entry clearance which describes the appellant as  now  being  13  years
    old, when in fact she was aged 12�.

10. The primary  ground  of  refusal  was  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    insistence  that  the  appellant's  grandmother  had   been   primarily
    responsible for her upbringing in Vietnam.  The Entry Clearance Officer
    said this conclusion was underpinned by the fact that  her  mother  had
    decided to leave her at least five  years  ago.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  also  refused  the  application  by  reference  to   paragraph
    297(i)(f).  His reasoning was if the appellant was  living  in  serious
    and compelling family or other circumstances, it would be reasonable to
    expect an application for settlement to join her mother in  the  United
    Kingdom to be made at the earliest opportunity.  She attended school in
    Vietnam and lived with a large extended family.  He  was  mindful  that
    his mother said that her grandmother's health was failing, but  he  was
    also mindful that other children and adults, all  of  whom  were  close
    family members of the appellant, lived in the same property.   Overall,
    he did not consider that her circumstances in Vietnam were  exceptional
    in relation to those of other 13 year olds living  there,  and  he  was
    also reminded that her circumstances in Vietnam had not  changed  since
    her mother went to the United Kingdom.

11. In order to meet the financial requirements of the Rules,  her  sponsor
    needed a gross income of at least �22,400 per annum.  The partner's tax
    documents showed that he had an income before tax of �20,458 from self-
    employment, running a nail bar.  But she had failed to provide a number
    of specified documents relating to the  partner's  self-employment  and
    income, and therefore the income of the partner could not be taken into
    account.

12. Both  parties  were  legally  represented  before  Judge  Brunnen.   At
    paragraph [10} of  his  subsequent  decision,  Judge  Brunnen  said  as
    follows:

         "Mr Thornhill made clear that the appellant does not  seek  to  say
         that there  are  serious  and  compelling  reasons  that  make  her
         exclusion undesirable."

13. Mr Thornhill confirmed to me that this was correct.  Mr Thornhill  only
    sought to advance the case that the sponsor had had sole responsibility
    for the appellant's upbringing at the date of decision, and  the  judge
    was so persuaded.

14. The judge then proceeded to consider the  financial  evidence  at  some
    length.  At paragraph [42] he found that, but for the missing SA300  or
    SA302 -  which  is  mandatory  evidence,  the  evidence  concerning  Mr
    Nguyen's self-employment would be satisfactory to establish within  the
    relevant year that he had gross self-employed earnings  of  �18,000.10.
    The judge was satisfied that the sponsor earned �384.40 each  month  in
    the six months prior to the  date  of  application,  equivalent  to  an
    annual gross income of �4,612.  If the sum was  added  to  Mr  Nguyen's
    profit of  �18,010,  the  result  would  be  �22,622,  which  would  be
    sufficient to satisfy the requirement of �23,400.   But  owing  to  the
    lack of the SA300 or SA32, which was mandatory evidence, he  could  not
    take Mr Nguyen's earnings into  account  and  therefore  the  appellant
    failed to satisfy the financial requirement.

15. The judge went on to address the Article 8 claim in paragraphs [53]  to
    [64]. In his consideration, which ran to five pages, the judge cited  a
    number of passages from SS Congo [2015] EWCA  Civ  387,  including  the
    Court of Appeal's observations on near miss cases.

16. At paragraph [58] he said that, of all  the  relevant  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE, the SA300 or SA302 appeared to  him  to  be  the  least
    important in establishing the earnings of the appellant's  sponsor  and
    stepfather.  So he took this into account.  However,  he  continued  in
    paragraph [59], he was not satisfied that the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant pointed strongly in favour of entry clearance being  granted.
    She was living in the household where  she  had  lived  all  her  life.
    There was nothing to suggest she  was  not  well  cared  for  and  well
    provided for.  She was being educated.  Her mother was now able to make
    reasonably frequent visits to see her.  There was  nothing  to  suggest
    that she pined for her mother, or was unhappy living in the  only  home
    she had ever known.

17. The only factual concern for her present welfare and best interests was
    that it was said that her  grandmother  was  now  in  poor  health  and
    finding it difficult to care for her.  However, the judge did not  gain
    the impression from the evidence  of  the  sponsor  that  her  mother's
    health was a serious problem for the appellant's  welfare.   The  judge
    continued in paragraph [62]:

         "I bear in mind that the appellant is now  13  years  of  age.   No
         doubt she needs supervision and guidance but a girl of this age can
         generally be expected to manage all the activities of daily  living
         without assistance  and  there  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  the
         appellant is any different."

18. The judge concluded in paragraph [63] that he was satisfied it was  not
    contrary to the appellant's best interests to  remain  in  her  present
    circumstances in Vietnam.  The judge went on to refer to paragraph [40]
    of SS Congo where  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  LTTE  Rules
    maintain,  in  general  terms,  a  reasonable  relationship  with   the
    requirements of Article 8 in the ordinary run of cases.  Judge  Brunnen
    found that the evidence in the case before him did not take it  out  of
    the ordinary  run  of  cases.   He  found  there  were  not  compelling
    circumstances that were not sufficiently recognised by the  Immigration
    Rules and which required the appellant to be granted  entry  clearance.
    He found that the near miss in respect of the evidence  under  Appendix
    FM-SE did not tip the  balance  in  her  favour.   He  found  that  the
    respondent's decision was proportionate.

19. I consider that in  an  exemplary  judgment  Judge  Brunnen  has  given
    adequate reasons for dismissing the appellant's appeal under Article  8
    ECHR, and that his  approach  is  fully  compliant  with  the  approach
    endorsed by the Upper Tribunal in Mundeba.

20. I do not consider that the judge's error about the appellant's  age  at
    the date of decision is material.  It did not,  on  analysis,  permeate
    his reasoning as a whole, and he would not have arrived at a  different
    decision if he had directed himself that the appellant was in fact aged
    12� at the date of decision, as opposed to being aged 13.

21. The evidence as to the mother discussing the signs of puberty with  her
    daughter was relied on as demonstrating  sole  responsibility,  not  as
    showing that the emotional needs of  the  appellant  were  unmet  as  a
    result of her living with her grandmother  and  uncle,  as  opposed  to
    living with her  mother  and  stepfather.   Furthermore,  there  is  no
    substance to the argument advanced in paragraph 7  of  the  grounds  of
    appeal that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to take such  evidence
    into account.  It was open to the judge to find, as he does at the  end
    of paragraph [59], that there was nothing to suggest that the appellant
    was pining for her mother or was unhappy living in the  only  home  she
    had  ever  known.   The  judge   took   into   account   all   relevant
    considerations bearing on the question  of  proportionality,  and  made
    findings that were open to him on the evidence.  Accordingly, no  error
    of law is made out.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
