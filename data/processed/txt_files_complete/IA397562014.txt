For the appellant:     Mr J Plowright, instructed by Indra Sebastian
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Kanagarajar Kajaneshan, date  of  birth  28.9.79,  is  a
    citizen of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Molloy promulgated 28.8.15, dismissing his appeal against the  decision
    of the Secretary of State, dated 22.9.14, to refuse him leave to remain
    outside the Immigration Rules  to  receive  medical  treatment  and  to
    remove him from the UK pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 14.8.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Murray  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.1.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 19.2.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I found no error of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Molloy to be set aside. I announced my decision at the  appeal
    hearing, reserving my reasons, which I now give.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant first entered the UK on 19.2.06 with leave  to  remain  as  a
    student. This was subsequently extended to 13.12.12. However, on 8.5.12
    his student leave was curtailed to  expire  7.7.12,  as  the  UKBA  was
    informed that he had ceased studies. On 28.6.12 he applied for leave to
    remain outside the Rules, which was granted on a discretionary basis to
    24.6.14. Shortly prior to the expiry  of  that  leave,  he  applied  on
    16.6.14 for leave to remain outside the Rules on human rights  grounds,
    because of his medical condition, asserting that to remove him would be
    contrary to article 3 ECHR. The medical evidence is summarised  in  the
    refusal decision, but in short since about 2009 he has been treated for
    kidney problems and latterly  renal  failure,  ultimately  requiring  a
    kidney transplant.

 7. The Secretary of State's case on refusal was that  notwithstanding  the
    appellant's ill-health he has not established a sufficiently real  risk
    that his removal from the UK would breach article 3. He is not  in  the
    final stages of his illness associated with an absence  of  appropriate
    treatment  and  support  in  Sri  Lanka.  His  circumstances  are   not
    exceptional and thus do not reach  the  high  threshold  sufficient  to
    engage article 3, pursuant to the case law including N  v  SSHD  [2005]
    and N v UK [2008] ECHR 453.

 8. In summary, the grounds of application for permission to appeal  assert
    that the judge misapplied the case of CS & others v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 40, which held that the absence or inadequacy of medical treatment,
    even life-preserving treatment, in the country  of  return,  cannot  be
    relied on at all as a factor engaging article 8; if that is  all  there
    is, the claim must fail. At �86 the court held that if  the  article  3
    claim fails,  "article  8  cannot  prosper  without  some  separate  or
    additional factual element which brings the case within the  article  8
    paradigm - the capacity to form and enjoy relationships - or a state of
    affairs having some affinity with the paradigm."

 9. Thus, where article 8 is engaged by other factors, the  fact  that  the
    appellant is receiving medical treatment in this country and which  may
    not be available in the country of return,  may  be  a  factor  in  the
    proportionality exercise, but it cannot by itself give rise to a breach
    since that would give rise to a breach that would  contravene  the  'no
    obligation to treat' principle. A specific case  has  to  be  made  out
    under article 8.

10. Mr Plowright sought  to  distinguish  the  claimant  in  GS  from  this
    appellant, on the basis that GS had been in the  UK  unlawfully,  which
    fact was said to negate the effect  which  his  right  to  respect  for
    private life would otherwise have had on  his  article  8  claim.  This
    appellant entered the UK lawfully with leave and has had  lawful  leave
    throughout, despite curtailment of leave. The point is also  made  that
    he is not seeking indefinite leave to remain but only to  complete  his
    studies, interrupted by his serious ill-health, before returning to Sri
    Lanka.

11. Mr Plowright submits that at �19 of the decision the judge ruled out of
    consideration any article 8 private life claim, focusing solely on  the
    health issues.

12. However, it is beyond  argument  that  as  a  student  the  appellant's
    immigration status in the UK must be regarded as  precarious,  pursuant
    to section 117B of the 2002  Act  and  thus  little  weight  should  be
    accorded to any private life developed in the UK. Whilst  Mr  Plowright
    relies on the  lengthy  period  of  lawful  presence  in  the  UK,  the
    appellant cannot claim any 'credit' towards private life for  the  fact
    that his presence has been lawful.

13. Further, the recent case law has established that status as  a  student
    does not give rise to private life engaging article 8, as held in Nasim
    and others (article  8)  [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  where  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical  removal  of  the  22  PBS
    claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case
    must  be  determined  on  its  merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity."

14. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

15. At �14 of Nasim, the panel stated:

         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

16. The panel pointed out  that  at  this  point  on  the  continuum,  "the
    essential elements of the private  life  relied  on  will  normally  be
    transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in  their
    essential respects, following a person's return to their home  country,
    (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its limited utility to an individual where
    one has moved along the continuum, from that  Article's  core  area  of
    operation towards what might be described as its  fuzzy  penumbra.  The
    limitation arises, both from what will at that point  normally  be  the
    tangential effect on the individual of the  proposed  interference  and
    from the fact that, unless there are particular reasons to  reduce  the
    public interest of enforcing immigration controls, that  interest  will
    consequently prevail in  striking  the  proportionality  balance  (even
    assuming that stage is reached)."

17. Applying the above guidance and case authority, even if the  judge  had
    addressed the issue of private life in more  depth,  it  is  inevitable
    that the same conclusion would have been  reached:  that  there  is  no
    private life sufficient to engage article 8 and to  which  the  factors
    relating to the appellant's ill-health could attach so  as  to  justify
    granting leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules, on the basis of
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised in the Rules.

18. The ground of appeal takes advantage of a supposed failure  to  address
    private life in any detail, but I am not satisfied that the  judge  was
    required to do so on the facts of this case  and  even  if  he  was  so
    required, the case law is entirely against the appellant  so  that  his
    ill-health cannot and could not convert an otherwise  unremarkable  and
    entirely uncompelling private life  claim  to  one  that  would  engage
    article 8.

19. In my view, the grant of permission to appeal was misguided.  There  is
    no material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

20. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
