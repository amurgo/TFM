Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr M Iqbal (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Miss I Isherwood (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Bircher promulgated on 15th  December  2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 11th November 2014.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Mr Manish Kumar Sharma and Mrs Aarti Sharma.  The
    Respondent Secretary  of  State,  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter
    comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are citizens of India.  The first Appellant, a male, was
    admitted to the UK on 12th September 2009 on a student visa, valid from
    28th August 2009 to 28th June 2011.   The  second  Appellant  was  last
    admitted to the UK as a post-study partner to the first Appellant valid
    from 26th November 2012 to 30th January 2014.  On 24th January 2014 the
    Appellant sought a residence card which was refused on 19th March 2014.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that they were dependent on  an  EEA  national
    Sponsor, namely, Mr Arnaldo Richard Teles, a Portuguese  national,  who
    was born on 18th July 1980, and who claimed to be a  person  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK by virtue of  his  full-time  employment.   The
    first Appellant is the cousin of Mr  Teles.   Mr  Teles  claims  to  be
    employed with Contact  Transport,  Garrets  Green  Freight  Department,
    Garrets Green, Birmingham B33 0SL, and his weekly wage is approximately
    �500.  He claims

         "to have supported his cousin  and  has  worked  financially  every
         month and further claims that he has been supporting both  of  them
         in India for their studies.  Mr Teles stated that his cousin (first
         Appellant) and his cousin's wife (second Appellant) shared a  house
         with him in India" (paragraph 8).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard oral evidence from the Appellants and their EEA Sponsor
    (paragraph  9)  the  evidence  before  the  judge  confirmed  that  the
    Appellants were living with the Sponsor in India from 2002.  The  judge
    heard evidence from the first Appellant that the EEA  Sponsor  provided
    him with "purely financial support of no fixed amount" but that he  had
    last given him �300 in  October  to  pay  for  the  next  month's  rent
    (paragraph 13).  That the EEA Sponsor explained that "he had helped the
    first  Appellant  financially  in  India  when  he  was  working  as  a
    supermarket manager" (paragraph 15).

 5. The judge accepted that the Appellants were members of the EEA national
    Sponsor's household namely in India (paragraph 17).  There was evidence
    before the judge in the form of affidavits and the judge  accepted  the
    content of these affidavits (see  paragraphs  18  to  23).   The  judge
    accepted the evidence that was put before him  (see  paragraphs  32  to
    34).  He concluded that the Appellants are family  members  of  an  EEA
    national Sponsor and to qualify for a residence  card  (paragraph  35).
    The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in  a  number  of
    respects.  First, even if the  judge  was  satisfied  on  the  evidence
    before him, it was not open to him to allow the appeal  outright.   The
    best he could do was to remit the matter back to the Secretary of State
    for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  exercise  discretion.    This   was
    established by the judgments in Ihemedu [2011] UKUT 00340.  Second, the
    judge relied on paragraph  345AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    application of the evidential  flexibility  policy,  but  this  had  no
    application in EEA law, and the judge was wrong to apply it there.

 7. On 2nd February 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 24th March 2015, neither the Appellants nor
    the Sponsor were in attendance.  Mr M Iqbal, of  Counsel,  appeared  to
    represent them.  The Respondent Secretary of State, who  was  appealing
    the decision below, was represented by Miss I Isherwood, a Senior  Home
    Office Presenting Officer.

 9. Miss Isherwood relied upon the Grounds of Appeal.  First, she submitted
    that the judge could not have been satisfied on the evidence before him
    that the Appellants had  established  their  relationship  to  the  EEA
    Sponsor, which evidence was based from an affidavit from an  individual
    in India (see paragraphs 17  and  21).   It  was  not  clear  from  the
    determination who Chinder Pal  Sharma  was,  and  so  reliance  on  his
    affidavit could not be placed in the way that it was by the judge.  The
    fact was that  there  was  no  independent  or  official  documentation
    available to evidence the claimed relationship (see paragraph 21).  The
    burden remained on the Appellants to discharge their case to the  civil
    standard.  They were unable to do so.

10. Second, even if the judge was to be satisfied on the evidence,  he  was
    wrong to allow the appeal  outright  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  This was because whether a  residence
    card is issued to a Regulation 8(5) extended family member  is  at  the
    discretion of the Secretary of State.  The case of Ihemedu [2011]  UKUT
    00340 makes it clear that,

         "where the Secretary of State has not yet exercised that discretion
         the most an Immigration Judge is entitled to do  is  to  allow  the
         appeal as being not in accordance with the law leaving  the  matter
         of whether to exercise this discretion in the Appellant's favour or
         not to the Secretary of State".

    The judge therefore erred in law in allowing the appeal outright.

11. Third, the  judge  had  erred  in  concluding  that  just  because  the
    Appellants resided with Mr Teles, that they were  dependent  upon  him.
    The affidavits which the judge relied  upon  at  paragraph  19  do  not
    demonstrate, at the very highest, that the property was rented out,  in
    joint names, to the Appellant, and the EEA national from  January  2002
    to December 2009.  There was no evidence adduced to show that  the  EEA
    national incurred any additional expenses during this period of  shared
    residence.  Nor is it the case that the documentation shows the payment
    of  the  Appellants'  tuition  fees  (see  paragraph  32).   A   simple
    cohabitation did not amount  to  "dependency"  as  required  under  the
    Regulations.

12. Fourth, the judge erroneously directed himself to  paragraph  245AA  of
    the Respondent's evidential flexibility  policy  because  this  had  no
    application in the EEA national case.

13. Fifth, the judge provided  inadequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    Appellants were presently dependent on the  EEA  national.   While  the
    bank statements provided show a few payments  to  the  Appellants  from
    December 2013, there was no evidence of any dependency  from  2009,  as
    claimed.

14. For his part, Mr Iqbal submitted that to say that the standard of proof
    had not been discharged, on the basis of the oral evidence heard by the
    judge, and on the basis of the affidavit of  Chinder  Pal  Sharma,  was
    simply to disagree with the judge's findings.  Second,  the  Respondent
    had not taken issue with the Sponsor's EEA status  (see  paragraph  30)
    and it was therefore open to the judge to accept what the EEA  national
    said with respect to his status in the UK.  Third, as far as membership
    of the household was concerned, the tuition fees were paid, and  whilst
    it  is  accepted  that  paragraph  245AA  was  misconceived   in   this
    application, the judge was entitled to take into account as he  did  at
    paragraph 28.  Finally, there was plainly evidence before the judge  of
    dependency and of membership of a household of the EEA Sponsor.

15. In reply, Miss Isherwood submitted that the case of Dauhoo (EEA Regs  -
    Reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT 79 establishes  that  a  person  can  succeed  in
    showing that they are a "extended family member" in  any  one  of  four
    different ways, each of which requires proving  a  relevant  connection
    both prior to arrival in the UK and in the UK.  These are:

      1) prior dependency and present dependency;

      2) prior membership  of  a  household  and  present  membership  of  a
         household;

      3) prior dependency and present membership of a household; and

      4) prior membership of a household and present dependency.

    It was not necessary to show prior and present connection in  the  same
    capacity.  However, these Appellants here simply provided  no  evidence
    of dependency since 2009.

Error of Law and Re-Making the Decision

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  I do so for the reasons given by Miss Isherwood before me.

17. There is an error of law simply because the judge was not  entitled  to
    allow the appeal  outright,  but  to  remit  the  matter  back  to  the
    Secretary of State.  There is an error of law also  because  there  was
    reliance placed by the judge upon paragraph 245AA of HC 395.  This  has
    no application in EEA law.

18.  I have remade the decision  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the
    original judge, the evidence before him, and  the  submissions  that  I
    have heard today.  I  am  dismissing  this  appeal  for  the  following
    reasons.  First, providing "financial support" (see paragraphs 12,  and
    13) is not the same as  showing  "dependency"  under  the  Rules.   The
    Appellants do not show dependency.

19. There is no evidence whatsoever of any tuition fees being  paid  by  Mr
    Teles.  There is no evidence whatsoever  of  the  EEA  national  having
    occurred  any  additional  expenses  during  the  period  of  a  shared
    residence.  There is no evidence of  any  support  from  2009  onwards.
    There are affidavits, but the affidavits, such as the one from  Chinder
    Pal Sharma, have failed to show how the deponent of the  affidavit  can
    speak to the facts  alleged.   There  is  no  independent  or  official
    evidence of the claimed relationship.

20. As far as the shared residence is concerned, at best it shows that  the
    property was rented out in joint names, but this  does  not  mean  that
    there was dependency of the Appellants on the EEA Sponsor.  It  is  for
    the Appellants to discharge  the  burden  of  proof  at  the  requisite
    standard.  They have signally failed to do so in this appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law such that it  falls  to  be  set  aside.   I  set  aside  the
decision of the original judge.  I remake the  decision  as  follows.   This
appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
