                    Rashid Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appealed against  the  decision  of  Judge  E  M
    Simpson of the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated  on  13th  May
    2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FtT and I will refer to him as the claimant.

 3. The claimant is a male citizen of Pakistan, born 1st January  1986  who
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 8th April 2010 with leave to enter  as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student, his visa being  valid  until  29th  October
    2013.  On 8th October 2013 the claimant applied for leave to remain  as
    the spouse of Faiza Ali (the Sponsor) a  British  citizen  who  he  had
    married on 30th September 2013.

 4. The application was refused on 1st August 2014, the Secretary of  State
    making a decision to refuse to vary leave to remain, and a decision  to
    remove the claimant from the United Kingdom.  The  reason  for  refusal
    was that the claimant did not satisfy the  financial  requirements  set
    out in E-LTRP.3.1 of Appendix FM, which provides that there must  be  a
    specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.   The  Secretary  of
    State contended that the claimant and his spouse  had  demonstrated  an
    annual income of only �10,545.36 at the date the application for  leave
    to remain was submitted.

 5. The claimant appealed to the FtT and the appeal was heard on 31st March
    2015.  The FtT found that the claimant did not  satisfy  the  financial
    requirements at the date of application, which  had  been  conceded  on
    behalf of the claimant.  However the FtT found that  the  claimant  had
    proved that he met the specified gross  annual  income  requirement  of
    �18,600 at the date that the Secretary of State made  the  decision  to
    refuse his application, and at the date of the FtT hearing.  The appeal
    was therefore allowed on that basis under the Immigration Rules.

 6. The FtT also considered EX.1.(b) of Appendix  FM  but  found  that  the
    appeal could not succeed under that provision, as the claimant had  not
    proved that there would be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing with the Sponsor outside the United Kingdom.  In considering
    this provision, the FtT  took  into  account  EX.2  which  states  that
    insurmountable obstacles means the very significant difficulties  which
    would be faced by the claimant or his spouse in continuing family  life
    together outside the United Kingdom, which could  not  be  overcome  or
    would entail very serious hardship.

 7. It was not suggested to the FtT, on behalf of the  claimant,  that  the
    appeal could succeed with reference to paragraph 276ADE(1) in  relation
    to private life.

 8. The FtT considered Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention  on  Human
    Rights (the 1950 Convention) outside the Immigration Rules, and  found,
    taking into account that the financial requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules were satisfied at the date of refusal and at  the  date  hearing,
    that the Secretary of State's decision amounted to  a  disproportionate
    interference with family life, and therefore the appeal was allowed  on
    human rights grounds, as well as  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Secretary of State applied for and was granted permission to appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.



Error of Law

 9. At the hearing before me on 30th November  2015,  I  heard  submissions
    from both parties regarding error of law.  On behalf of  the  Secretary
    of State it was argued that the FtT had clearly erred by  allowing  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules, as the rules required  the  minimum
    income threshold to have been met and demonstrated by the provision  of
    specified evidence at the date of  application,  not  at  the  date  of
    refusal or at the date of hearing.  It was submitted that the  FtT  had
    erred in allowing the appeal outside the Immigration Rules  as  it  had
    not been demonstrated that there were any exceptional circumstances.

10. On behalf of the claimant it was conceded that the FtT had erred in law
    in allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules, but submitted  that
    the FtT had not erred in law by allowing the  appeal  under  Article  8
    outside the rules.

11. I set out below my conclusions and reasons for finding an error of  law
    and setting aside the decision of the FtT;

         "21. It was rightly conceded on behalf of the claimant that the FtT
             materially erred in  law  in  paragraphs  35  and  36  of  the
             decision in finding that the claimant satisfied the  financial
             requirements of Appendix FM.  The claimant did not satisfy the
             minimum annual income requirements set out in E-ECP.3.1 at the
             date of application, and the Secretary of State was correct to
             refuse the application for leave to remain on that basis,  and
             the FtT was wrong to allow  the  appeal.   Therefore  the  FtT
             decision to allow the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  is
             set aside because of material legal error.

         22.  It has not been  contended  that  the  FtT  erred  in  law  in
             consideration of EX.1(b) which was considered in paragraphs 38-
             46.  The FtT found no insurmountable obstacles to the claimant
             and spouse carrying on family life outside the UK.

         23.  The issue that I have to decide is  whether  or  not  the  FtT
             erred in law in consideration of Article 8 outside the  rules.
             My view is that the challenge  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
             grounds  should  be  interpreted  widely,  meaning  that   the
             challenge is that the  FtT  erred  by  considering  Article  8
             outside the Immigration Rules, but in the alternative,  if  it
             was correct to consider Article 8 outside the rules,  the  FtT
             erred materially in considering proportionality.

         24.  The grant of permission to appeal does not indicate  that  any
             aspect  of  the  application  for  permission  to  appeal  was
             refused.

         25.  The FtT makes no reference to SS (Congo) which  was  published
             on 23rd April 2015 and therefore had not been  published  when
             the FtT hearing took place, but had been published by the time
             the decision was promulgated on 13th May  2015.   Guidance  is
             given in SS  (Congo)  regarding  consideration  of  Article  8
             outside the Immigration Rules, and I set out  below  paragraph
             33

                  "33. In our judgment, even though a test of exceptionality
                      does not apply in every case falling within the scope
                      of Appendix FM,  it  is  accurate  to  say  that  the
                      general  position  outside  the  sorts   of   special
                      contexts  referred  to  above  is   that   compelling
                      circumstances would need to be identified to  support
                      a claim for grant of LTR outside  the  new  rules  in
                      Appendix FM.  In our  view,  that  is  a  formulation
                      which is not as strict as a test of exceptionality or
                      a  requirement  of  'very  compelling  reasons'   (as
                      referred to in MF (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the
                      rules applicable to  foreign  criminals),  but  which
                      gives appropriate weight to the focused consideration
                      of public interest factors as finds expression in the
                      Secretary of State's formulation of the new rules  in
                      Appendix FM.  It also  reflects  the  formulation  in
                      Nagre at para [29], which has  been  tested  and  has
                      survived  scrutiny  in   this   court:   see,   e.g.,
                      Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ."

         26.  Therefore, in order to consider  and  grant  leave  to  remain
             outside the Immigration  Rules,  under  Article  8,  when  the
             requirements  of  Appendix  FM  cannot  be  satisfied,  it  is
             necessary to identify compelling circumstances, which have not
             been considered adequately under the rules.

         27.  In this appeal, the FtT found no very significant difficulties
             for the claimant and spouse to continue  family  life  outside
             the UK.  The Upper Tribunal in R (on the application of  Chen)
             (Appendix  FM   -   Chikwamba   -   temporary   separation   -
             proportionality) IJR [2015]  UKUT  00189  (IAC)  decided  that
             Appendix FM does not include  consideration  of  the  question
             whether it would be disproportionate to expect  an  individual
             to return to his home  country  to  make  an  entry  clearance
             application to rejoin a family member in the UK.  There may be
             cases in which there are no insurmountable obstacles to family
             life  being  enjoyed  outside  the  UK  but  where   temporary
             separation to enable an individual to make an application  for
             entry clearance may be disproportionate.   In  all  cases,  it
             will be for the individual to place before  the  Secretary  of
             State evidence that such temporary separation  will  interfere
             disproportionately with protected  rights.   It  will  not  be
             enough to rely solely upon the case law concerning Chikwamba v
             SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.

         28.  The error of the FtT in  considering  Article  8  was  not  to
             identify compelling circumstances over and above what had been
             considered under the Immigration Rules.  In my  view  the  FtT
             erred in law in paragraph 59 in considering  as  relevant  the
             difficulties that the claimant may have in succeeding  with  a
             fresh application.  The Upper  Tribunal  in  paragraph  33  of
             Sabir  [2014]  UKUT  63  (IAC)  when  considering  whether  an
             individual should return to their home  country  and  make  an
             application for entry clearance stated;

                  "The likelihood or otherwise of her being able to meet the
                  requirements of the rules for entry  clearance  is  not  a
                  relevant consideration - see SB (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2007]
                  EWCA Civ 28."

         29.  For the above reasons, I conclude that the FtT erred in law in
             allowing the appeal under Article 8  outside  the  Immigration
             Rules."

12. The hearing was adjourned to enable the claimant to provide  up-to-date
    evidence, taking into account the length of time that had elapsed since
    the FtT hearing which took place on 31st March 2015.  As  the  findings
    of the FtT in relation  to  EX.1(b)  had  not  been  challenged,  those
    findings were preserved.  It was accepted on  behalf  of  the  claimant
    that the financial requirements of Appendix FM could not be  satisfied,
    and that the appeal could  not  succeed  with  reference  to  paragraph
    276ADE(1), and therefore the issue  to  be  decided  at  the  adjourned
    hearing related to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, and whether
    there are compelling circumstances to justify allowing the appeal under
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

Re-Making the Decision - Upper Tribunal Hearing 16th February 2016

Preliminary Issues

13. I ascertained that I had received  all  documentation  upon  which  the
    parties intended to rely, and that each party had served the other with
    any documentation upon  which  reliance  was  to  be  placed.   At  the
    commencement of the hearing Mr Sellwood submitted some Tesco pay  slips
    for the claimant covering a period between 10th  April  2015  and  12th
    February 2016, and some pay slips issued by Search in relation  to  the
    Sponsor, covering a period between 20th November 2015 and  1st  January
    2016, together with a letter dated 27th  January  2016  confirming  the
    Sponsor had been offered new employment as a customer service agent  at
    London Gatwick Airport to commence on 21st March 2016, and  documentary
    confirmation that she had registered  with  BPP  University  as  a  law
    student.

14. In addition I had the documentation  that  had  been  before  the  FtT,
    comprising the Home Office bundle  with  Annexes  A-I,  the  claimant's
    bundle comprising 616 pages and the claimant's skeleton argument  dated
    30th March 2015.  I also had a further bundle submitted  on  behalf  of
    the claimant, in preparation for the  hearing  on  30th November  2015
    comprising 125 pages.

15. Both representatives confirmed that they  had  seen  my  error  of  law
    decision which was promulgated on 18th December 2015 and it was  agreed
    that the only issue to be decided by the Upper  Tribunal,  was  whether
    there were compelling circumstances which justified allowing the appeal
    under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

16. Mr Sellwood indicated that the claimant and  Sponsor  would  give  oral
    evidence.

17. Both representatives indicated that they  were  ready  to  proceed  and
    there was no application for an adjournment.

The Claimant's Oral Evidence

18.  The  claimant  gave  evidence  in  English  and  did  not  require  an
    interpreter.  I set out below a summary of his evidence.

19. When questioned by Mr Sellwood the claimant confirmed that he was still
    employed by Tesco.  It was put to him that he would be able to  make  a
    fresh application for further leave to remain if  his  appeal  did  not
    succeed, and his response was that his  employer  would  not  keep  his
    employment open for him.  He said that he had asked his employer  about
    this following the hearing in November 2015.

20. When questioned by Mr Nath the claimant said it would be very difficult
    for him to find employment if he had to return to Pakistan  because  he
    had no experience of employment there.  He confirmed that he  had  been
    awarded a BA honours degree in Applied Accounting in this  country  but
    stated that notwithstanding this qualification, he would still find  it
    very difficult to find employment in Pakistan.  He said he  had  spoken
    to his friends about this, who have studied more than himself, and they
    had not been able to find employment in Pakistan.  The claimant had not
    returned to Pakistan since coming to the United Kingdom in April  2010.
    This is because he had been busy with his studies.

21. The claimant confirmed that his parents live in Pakistan as do his  two
    brothers and two sisters.  His sisters are  married  but  his  brothers
    still live with his parents.  He said that if he and the Sponsor return
    to Pakistan it would be very difficult to stay with his family  because
    the family home only had two bedrooms.

The Sponsor's Oral Evidence

22. The Sponsor gave her evidence in English and her evidence is summarised
    below.

23. The Sponsor left her employment in January 2016, and is to commence new
    employment in March 2016.  She is now studying  for  a  law  degree  at
    university having enrolled in May 2015.  It is a full-time degree,  and
    her new employment will be for twenty hours per week  although  she  is
    guaranteed overtime.

24. The Sponsor confirmed that  her  mother  is  still  not  aware  of  her
    marriage.  When asked whether  she  could  manage  financially  if  the
    claimant returned to Pakistan to apply for  entry  clearance  she  said
    that she could not but if the claimant stayed in the United Kingdom and
    made his application, but had no employment, she said that somehow they
    would manage financially by asking family and  friends,  although  they
    could not do that indefinitely.

25. When questioned by Mr Nath the Sponsor said that she had  been  married
    for two or three years.  She confirmed that she would be  able  to  ask
    her mother for money but would not tell her mother that she is married.
     She said  that  she  would  tell  her  about  her  marriage  once  the
    claimant's visa was sorted out.

26. The Sponsor is a British citizen and in addition  to  her  mother,  her
    older sister and three younger brothers  live  in  this  country.   Her
    father has passed away.

27. The Sponsor did not think that the  claimant  had  made  any  enquiries
    about working in Pakistan  but  commented  that  if  he  went  back  to
    Pakistan he would find work there.

The Secretary of State's Submissions

28. Mr Nath submitted that the appeal should be dismissed.  I was asked  to
    note that the claimant had made no  enquiries  about  finding  work  in
    Pakistan, and that he has family members there, who have a  home.   The
    claimant has the option of making a  fresh  application  for  leave  to
    remain, in order to prove that he can satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Alternatively, the Sponsor could return to Pakistan with him.

The Claimant's Submissions

29. Mr Sellwood submitted  that  compelling  circumstances  exist  in  this
    appeal, which would justify allowing the appeal under Article 8 outside
    the Immigration Rules.

30. I was asked to find that evidence had been submitted  that  the  couple
    had an income in excess of �18,600 although it was accepted  that  they
    had been unable to provide the specified evidence to prove this at  the
    date of application.

31. I was asked to find that  the  claimant  and  Sponsor  are  financially
    independent.

32. Mr Sellwood submitted that the claimant  had  established  family  life
    with the Sponsor, and a  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    claimant has an adult brother in the United Kingdom,  but  it  was  not
    contended that he had family life with his brother  that  would  engage
    Article 8, although his relationship with his brother  formed  part  of
    his private life.

33. I was asked to note that the Sponsor is a British citizen and had lived
    in this country all her life.  She had only visited Pakistan for  brief
    periods.  She did not speak fluent Urdu or Punjabi.  Her family in this
    country are not aware of her marriage.

34. I was asked to note that the claimant had always had leave to be in the
    United Kingdom and had  not  remained  here  unlawfully.   Mr  Sellwood
    submitted that it was highly relevant that the claimant  has  not  been
    and would not be a financial burden on the state.

35. I was asked to find that if the  claimant  returned  to  Pakistan  this
    would  be  problematic,  because  his  employer  would  not  keep   his
    employment open.  He would not be  able  to  meet  the  minimum  income
    threshold as he is now the main earner.

36. If the claimant  made  a  fresh  application  from  within  the  United
    Kingdom, which he could do, if this appeal was refused,  provided  that
    his application was made within 28 days of refusal, the claimant  would
    still be unable to continue with his employment, until the Secretary of
    State had made a decision on his application.

37. Mr Sellwood submitted that on the facts of this case, it could  not  be
    reasonable to expect the Sponsor to relocate to Pakistan.

38. I was therefore asked to find that compelling circumstances  exist  and
    the appeal should be allowed under Article 8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.

39. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

40. It  is  common  ground  that  this  appeal  cannot  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  This is because the  claimant  cannot  satisfy  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM, and the FtT finding  that  there
    are no insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  outside  the
    United Kingdom was not challenged, and means  that  the  appeal  cannot
    succeed with  reference  to  EX.1.(b).   It  has  also  been  expressly
    conceded that the claimant cannot succeed in relation  to  his  private
    life claim, with reference to paragraph 276ADE(1).

41. In considering Article 8, the burden of proof is  on  the  claimant  to
    establish that he has a family and/or private life that engages Article
    8.  If that is established, the Secretary of State must show  that  the
    decision is lawful, necessary for one of the reasons set out in Article
    8(2), and proportionate.  For ease of reference I set out Article 8;

         '1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private  and  family
             life, his home and his correspondence.

         2.   There should be no interference by a public authority with the
             exercise of this right except such as is  in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others.'

42. In considering Article  8  I  have  adopted  the  five  stage  approach
    advocated by the House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 which involves
    answering the following questions;

         "(i) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?

         (ii) If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

         (iii)    If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         (iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (v)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"

43. The decision in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 means that I  must  consider
    the family and private life of the Sponsor as well as the claimant.

44. I conclude that the claimant and Sponsor have established a family life
    together since their marriage on 30th September  2013.   The  Sponsor's
    private life is clearly based in this country, and I  accept  that  the
    claimant has established a private life here since his arrival  on  8th
    April 2010.  I conclude that the claimant's proposed removal  would  be
    an interference with both private and family life with consequences  of
    such gravity as to engage Article 8.

45. I find that the proposed interference is in accordance with the law, on
    the basis that the claimant cannot satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  in
    relation to his application for leave to remain.

46. I then consider whether the proposed interference is necessary for  one
    of the reasons set out in Article 8(2) and proportionate.

47. I remind myself of the principles in  SS  (Congo)  in  that  compelling
    circumstances need to be identified to support a claim for a  grant  of
    leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules.  Guidance was  given  in
    SS (Congo) in relation to the evidence rules contained in Appendix  FM-
    SE and I set out below paragraphs 51, and 52, and the first sentence of
    paragraph 53 of SS (Congo);

         "51. In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
             rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of
             the substantive LTE and LTR rules in Appendix  FM.   In  other
             words, the same  general  position  applies,  that  compelling
             circumstances would have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or
             LTR where the evidence rules are not complied with.

         52.  This is for two principal reasons.  First, the evidence  rules
             have the same general  objective  as  the  substantive  rules,
             namely to limit the risk that someone  is  admitted  into  the
             United Kingdom and then becomes a burden on public  resources,
             and the Secretary of State has the same  primary  function  in
             relation to them, to assess the risk and put in place measures
             which are judged suitable  to  contain  it  within  acceptable
             bounds.  Similar weight should be given to her  assessment  of
             what the public interest requires in both contexts.

         53.  Secondly, enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
             everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and fairly
             in relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy."

48. I also remind myself of the Supreme Court  decision  Patel  and  Others
    [2013] UKSC 72 in which it was stated at paragraph 57;

         "57. It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing power."

49. The Court of Appeal considered Article 8 in  Agyarko  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    440, commenting in paragraph 28 that an individual who claimed a  right
    to remain pursuant to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules,  had  to
    show that her case was exceptional for some reason, because her  family
    life had been established in the knowledge that she had no right to  be
    in the United Kingdom and was therefore precarious.  In this appeal, it
    is not the case that the claimant had no right to remain in the  United
    Kingdom, when he married the Sponsor, but his  immigration  status  was
    precarious, in that he only had limited leave to remain granted to  him
    on the basis that he was a student.

50. At paragraph 30 of Agyarko Sales  LJ  commented  that  in  relation  to
    precarious family life cases, the gap between section EX.1 of  Appendix
    FM and the requirements of Article 8 is likely to be small.

51. Sales LJ went on to state in paragraph 33 that the fact that a  Sponsor
    is a British citizen does not amount to exceptional circumstances.

52. In this appeal, there are no health issues, and there are no  children.
    The Sponsor is a British citizen who has  visited  Pakistan  but  never
    resided there.  Her family are in the United Kingdom.

53. The claimant has only ever had limited leave to remain  as  a  student,
    and married in that knowledge.

54. In considering proportionality  under  Article  8,  I  must  take  into
    account section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 which  specifically  states  that  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls is  in  the  public  interest.   I  conclude  that
    significant weight must be attached to that public interest, and weight
    must be attached to the fact that the claimant could  not  satisfy  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules, in that he  could  not
    prove a minimum annual income of �18,600, and  could  not  satisfy  the
    evidential requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE.

55. I take into account section 117B(2) in which it states that  it  is  in
    the public interest that a person seeking leave  to  remain  can  speak
    English, and (3) which states that it is in the public interest that  a
    person seeking to remain is financially independent.

56. The claimant is financially independent and can speak  English,  but  I
    must also take into account AM (Malawi) [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) in which
    it is stated that an individual can obtain no positive right to a grant
    of leave to remain from either section 117B(2)  or  (3),  whatever  the
    degree of his fluency in English, or  the  strength  of  his  financial
    resources.

57. I also take into account  section  117B(5)  which  states  that  little
    weight should be given to a private life established by a person  at  a
    time when his immigration  status  is  precarious.   The  claimant  has
    always had a precarious immigration status since  his  arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom, because he has always had limited leave to remain.

58. If this appeal  does  not  succeed  the  claimant  has  the  option  of
    returning to Pakistan with the Sponsor.  I do not accept the claimant's
    account that he would be unable to find employment in Pakistan.  I find
    that he has made no significant attempts to enquire  about  employment.
    I do not accept  his  evidence  that  the  qualification  that  he  has
    obtained in the United Kingdom would not be of assistance to him.   The
    claimant's purpose in coming to the United Kingdom  was  to  study  and
    obtain a qualification here, and in my view  he  would  have  indicated
    when he came to study in the United Kingdom, that he did not intend  to
    stay here permanently.  It  would  be  difficult  for  the  Sponsor  to
    relocate to Pakistan, although her family originate from  that  country
    and she has a grandmother there and she has  visited.   It  would  mean
    leaving her studies and  employment  in  the  United  Kingdom,  but  no
    satisfactory evidence has been submitted to indicate that  the  Sponsor
    could not study or work in Pakistan.  I accept that  she  would  rather
    not, but that is not the point at issue.  If the financial requirements
    of the Immigration Rules cannot  be  satisfied,  and  the  Sponsor  and
    claimant had to carry on their family life outside the United  Kingdom,
    I do not find that this would amount to compelling circumstances as  to
    why  the  appeal  should  be  allowed  under  Article  8  outside   the
    Immigration Rules.

59. Another alternative would be for the claimant to return to Pakistan and
    make an application for entry clearance.  This would not be  a  similar
    case to Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40, as there would be no requirement  for
    the claimant to return to Pakistan simply for the  sake  of  procedure.
    The purpose of making an application for entry  clearance  from  abroad
    would be to make an application supported  by  the  specified  required
    evidence, to prove that the financial requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules can be satisfied.  That has not yet been proved.   In  accordance
    with Chen, in such a case it would  be  for  the  claimant  to  produce
    evidence   that   such    temporary    separation    would    interfere
    disproportionately with protected human rights, and I do not find  that
    any satisfactory evidence to prove this has been submitted.

60. A further alternative if this appeal was not successful  would  be  for
    the claimant  to  make  a  fresh  application  within  28  days,  which
    application could be made from within the United Kingdom.  Thereafter I
    accept that the claimant would not be able to take up employment  until
    his application had been determined because he would be an  overstayer,
    but the Sponsor confirmed that she would be able to manage  financially
    during this period, and I do not  find  that  this  amounts  to  either
    exceptional or compelling circumstances to justify allowing this appeal
    outside the Immigration Rules.

61. I therefore conclude that the weight to be attached to  the  importance
    of maintaining effective immigration control,  and  the  importance  of
    satisfying  the  financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration   Rules,
    outweighs the weight to be attached to the wishes of the  claimant  and
    Sponsor for the claimant to be granted  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  The decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  is  not
    disproportionate and does not breach Article 8 of the 1950  Convention.
