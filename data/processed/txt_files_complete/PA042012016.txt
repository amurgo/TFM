For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz     (Home Officer Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is the appellant's appeal to the  Upper Tribunal,  brought  with
the permission of a judge of the Upper Tribunal, from  a  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal (Judge Manyarara hereinafter "the Judge")  dismissing
his  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State   made   on
18 April 2016 to  refuse  to  grant  him  asylum  or  any  other  form  of
international protection and to refuse  to  grant  him  leave  to  enter  or
remain in the United Kingdom.

2.     By  way  of  background,  the  appellant  was  born  in  Pakistan  on
1 November 1985 and is a national of that country.  He entered the  UK  on
19 August 2010 as a  Tier 4  General  Student  Migrant  and  subsequently
obtained extensions, on a similar basis, until 15 October 2014.  He did not
obtain  any  further  leave  thereafter.   On  19 February 2016  he  was
encountered working illegally and served with notice as an over-stayer.   On
17 March 2016 he claimed asylum. That led to the above decision being made
by the Secretary of State and, in turn, to the decision of the Judge,  made
after a hearing of 10 June 2016 at which the appellant gave evidence and at
which both parties were represented, to dismiss the appeal.

3.    In seeking asylum and in pursuing his appeal the appellant offered  an
account of events which I have summarised below.

4.    The appellant claimed to be gay and said that he  was  from  a  strict
household in Pakistan.  He recounted a time in 2002 or 2003 when  he  viewed
some gay pornography via a cubicle at an internet caf�.   He  said  that  in
2005 he met a man named Azhar, that the two became friends,  and  that  some
seven or eight months later  he  made  advances  to  Azhar  which  were  not
resisted.  This resulted in them having a  gay  relationship.   However,  in
2010 they were discovered having sex at his family home by his (that is  the
appellant's) brother.  The brother threatened  him  with  a  knife  and  his
parents prevented him from seeing Azhar any more.  He says that  because  of
this he wanted to leave Pakistan and he decided to seek  leave  to  come  to
the UK for the purposes of study.  He claims that his parents supported  him
in this endeavour because they value education.  Having come to  the  UK  he
met a man named Usman with whom he started a gay relationship.  He told  his
UK based cousin about this and also informed  a  friend  in  the  UK  called
Bilal.  At one point he and Usman began  to  live  together.  The  appellant
took the decision to  tell  his  family  about  this  relationship  and,  in
consequence, they disowned him and said that  they  would  kill  him  if  he
returned to Pakistan.  He says that  he  did  not  seek  to  regularise  his
immigration status in the UK, after his leave had expired in  2014,  because
Usman had told him he would sort things out for  him.   However,  Usman  did
not do so and the relationship began to fail.  It ended  at  some  point  in
2015.  The appellant asserted, against that background,  that  he  would  be
persecuted as a result of his claimed sexual orientation if he  were  to  be
returned to Pakistan.

5.    The respondent did not believe the appellant's claim  to  be  gay  and
did not accept the account he had offered. Accordingly, it was concluded  he
would not be at risk upon return to Pakistan.   The  Judge,  similarly,  did
not find the appellant to be credible. In particular, the Judge said this:

      "Sexuality

      37.   In relation to whether the appellant is gay, as claimed, I  find
           that the appellant has not been consistent in  relation  to  the
           background to his claimed sexuality.  This is because there  are
           inconsistencies in his account, which are material to his claim,
           and his credibility is thereby called into question.  In further
           amplification of this finding, I draw attention to  the  answers
           given by  the  appellant  in  his  asylum  statement,  screening
           interview and asylum interview in relation to  material  aspects
           of the history of his claimed sexuality.

      38.   In his witness  statement,  at  paragraph 2,  page B1  of  the
           respondent's bundle, the appellant states the following:

                 'I first realised I was gay when I was 17 or 18 years old'

      39.   The appellant repeats this  statement  at  question 12  of  the
           asylum interview record.  The  appellant  was  still  living  in
           Pakistan when he was 17/18 years old.  The claim to  have  first
           realised he was gay when he was 17 or 18 is however at odds with
           what the appellant says at part 4.1 of the screening  interview,
           where the following statement is recorded as having been made by
           the appellant:

                 'I first realised  I  am  gay  in  September 2014  in  the
           United Kingdom'

      40.   I find that the appellant  has  not  been  able  to  maintain  a
           consistent account in relation to when he realised that  he  was
           gay.  I further find that the above statements do not  sit  well
           with the case advanced on behalf of  the  appellant.   The  case
           advanced on behalf of the appellant is that  the  appellant  did
           not realise that the feelings he was exhibiting were  homosexual
           feelings  and  that  this  therefore  explains  the  appellant's
           inability to maintain a consistent account in this  respect.   I
           do not accept that the appellant's inability  to  be  consistent
           about when he realised that he was gay is explained by a lack of
           awareness on his part.  This is because at paragraph 7  of  the
           asylum statement included in the respondent's bundle, which  can
           be found at page B1, the appellant says the following:

                 'However, homosexuality is an  awkward  issue  in  Pakistan
                 and no-one ever really spoke about  it.   As  a  result,  I
                 could not talk to my  friends  about  my  feelings  towards
                 men.'

      41.   The above statement is not consistent with the claimed  lack  of
           knowledge about same sex relationships.  Indeed, the  fact  that
           the appellant claims not to have  been  able  to  speak  to  his
           friends  about  his  feelings  suggests  an  awareness  that  is
           inconsistent with the claimed ignorance of  such  relationships.
           What the appellant was saying  at  paragraph 7  of  his  asylum
           statement was that he felt inhibited, and not that  he  did  not
           understand what  homosexuality  was.   The  appellant  therefore
           raises social mores as a reason for his inhibitions.  This  does
           not however sit well with the appellant's account to have viewed
           homosexual  pornography  in  a  public  place  (internet  caf�).
           Whilst the appellant states that he viewed the pornography in  a
           closed cubicle within the internet caf�,  this  account  is  not
           consistent with use of a public computer in circumstances  where
           the server would have identified the machine through which  such
           material was being viewed.  The fact that the appellant  was  in
           an internet caf� would mean that he would have had to either pay
           for use  of  the  machine,  or  register  his  presence  in  the
           particular cubicle, thereby immediately identifying who had been
           using the  machine  through  which  the  pornography  was  being
           viewed.   This  is  not  consistent  with  stated  views   about
           homosexuality in Pakistan, as well as the consequences  of  such
           relations.  I do not accept that the  appellant's  discovery  of
           his sexuality began with the viewing of pornographic material in
           a public place in Pakistan.   I  have  further  found  that  the
           appellant  has  been  inconsistent  as  to  where  and  when  he
           discovered his sexuality.

      42.   The appellant has also given an account to have been in  a  same
           sex relationship in Pakistan with an individual known as  Azhar.
           He adds that he embarked upon a physical relationship with Azhar
           at his family home and would meet Azhar there  when  his  family
           was out.  I find  that  I  cannot  place  any  reliance  on  the
           appellant's account of his relationship  with  Azhar.   This  is
           because  the  appellant  refers  to  having  been  raised  in  a
           conservative family.  The appellant however gives an account  of
           his brother walking in on him and Azhar whilst they were at  the
           family home.   The  appellant's  account  is  that  his  brother
           returned home and simply walked into the room that he and  Azhar
           were in, despite there being a lock on the door to the room (see
           paragraph 4  of  the  witness  statement   included   in   the
           respondent's bundle).  I do not accept that  the  appellant  and
           Azhar would have been in an unlocked room at  his  family  home.
           It is clear there was a lock on the door as the  appellant  adds
           that he only locked the door to the  room  after  he  had  asked
           Azhar  to  run  away  upon  his  brother's  arrival  (see   also
           paragraph 16  of  the  witness  statement  included   in   the
           appellant's bundle).  Whilst the appellant may have been willing
           to take risks to be with Azhar, I do not accept that having been
           raised in a conservative family, the appellant would  have  been
           in an open room in his family home with another man  at  a  time
           when any of his family members could have returned and seen him.
            This is not the only  problems  with  the  appellant's  account
           about his relationship with Azhar.

      43.   The appellant has further explained  that  he  had  developed  a
           friendship with Azhar, before making advances.   This  does  not
           however sit well with  the  appellant's  account  to  have  been
           concerned about the reaction of his own long-standing friends to
           his sexual feelings.  In his  asylum  interview,  the  appellant
           says (at question 44) that he was hopeful that Azhar would like
           the fact that he was kissing him.  This is contrary to what  the
           appellant says at question 25 of the asylum interview where  he
           refers to the difficulty in openly talking about  an  attraction
           to men for fear of being bullied.  The building of a  friendship
           does not then appear to be something that the  appellant  relied
           on to release his inhibitions.  Although he may have  been  able
           to build up a friendship with Azhar, I do not  accept  that  the
           appellant would simply have made physical advances towards Azhar
           without  first  establishing  what  Azhar's  views  were   about
           homosexuality if he could not be so open with his  own  friends,
           whom he had known for longer that he knew Azhar.

      44.   The appellant then proceeds to  describe  the  reaction  of  his
           parents when they arrived at the family home after he  had  been
           caught by his brother.   The  appellant  has  not  however  been
           consistent about the reaction of his family to the incident.  At
           paragraph 2 of the asylum statement included in the respondent's
           bundle, the appellant says  that  his  parents  confiscated  his
           mobile phone and did not let him leave the house.  He  adds,  at
           question 76 of his asylum interview, that his  family  did  not
           treat him appropriately after the incident involving Azhar.   In
           oral  evidence  before  me,  the   appellant   contradicts   his
           statements in interview about the response of his family to  the
           incident  involving  Azhar  by  saying  that  his   father   was
           interested in education and had accepted  his  explanation  that
           the situation involving Azhar was a one-off.   This  however  is
           inconsistent with what the appellant says at question 73 of the
           asylum interview, where the appellant says that his family  were
           of the opinion that he would be attracted to men forever.

      45.   The account above is at odds with  the  appellant's  ability  to
           make an application to study in the United Kingdom,  completely
           out of the control and influence of his family.   The  appellant
           explains the actions of his family in  this  respect  by  saying
           that his father believed in education.  It is not credible  that
           having practically been under house arrest at the hands  of  his
           own family, without access to the outside world,  the  appellant
           was then given the opportunity to live  in  a  western  society.
           The  appellant's  account  is  that   upon   arriving   in   the
           United Kingdom, he lived with a friend in London.  This was not
           then a case of leaving  his  family's  control  to  living  with
           extended/other family in the United Kingdom.

      46,   The appellant has also been inconsistent in respect  of  whether
           he has been open in the United Kingdom.   He  has  further  not
           maintained a consistent account in  respect  of  his  activities
           whilst he has been in the United Kingdom.  At question 119  of
           the asylum interview, the appellant is asked  if  he  would  say
           that he was openly living as a gay man in  the  United Kingdom.
           The appellant is recorded as  saying  that  he  was  not  openly
           living as a gay man.  The appellant however states the following
           at paragraph 16 of the asylum  statement  at  page B1  of  the
           respondent's bundle:

                 'In the UK I have the freedom to have open relationships'

      47.   This statement does not however sit well  with  the  appellant's
           claim not to have been aware that homosexuality is  not  illegal
           in the United Kingdom.

       48.    In  respect  of  his  claimed  relationship  with  Usman,  the
           appellant suggest that he was concerned about the community  yet
           was in a relationship (spending time together in  public  places
           such as the park and cohabiting) with a gay man whom he says had
           been ostracized by his own family for being gay.  These, I find,
           are not  the  actions  of  a  person  who  was  concerned  about
           community reactions.  The series of answers  above  do  not  sit
           well with the appellant's oral evidence that  he  was  not  open
           about his sexuality as  a  result  of  his  concerns  about  the
           community response.  They further  do  not  sit  well  with  his
           failure to make an asylum claim at the time that he  first  came
           into contact with the authorities in  the  United Kingdom.   In
           relation  to  whether  anyone  knew  about  his  sexuality,  the
           appellant refers to the fact that he had spoken a friend (Bilal)
           who was aware of his sexuality.  He adds that his  cousin  (Ali)
           and his cousin's wife were aware.  None of these witnesses  have
           however been called to give evidence.  The appellant's cousin is
           said to have contracted the flu.  His  wife's  absence  has  not
           however  been  explained,  despite  the  importance   of   these
           proceedings.

      49.   I have  found  that  the  appellant  has  been  inconsistent  in
           relation to the background to his claim.  I further find that as
           a result, I cannot place any  reliance  on  the  activities  and
           relationships the appellant relies on as being evidence  of  his
           claimed sexuality.  On the basis of all of the  evidence,  I  am
           not satisfied that the appellant is gay  as  claimed.   This  is
           because when his account is considered in the round,  there  are
           inconsistencies in the relation to the  background  and  centre-
           piece of his claim, as well as his actions since his arrival  in
           the United Kingdom.  As I have not believed that the  appellant
           is gay as claimed, I therefore do not proceed  to  consider  the
           remainder of the questions proposed by Lord Rodger in  relation
           to the appellant's actions on any return to Pakistan.   This  is
           because the appellant will  be  returning  as  a  failed  asylum
           seeker who has not established his claim to be gay.

      Section 8 consideration

      50.   In relation to the appellant's actions since he has been in  the
           United Kingdom, despite stating that he only became free in the
           United Kingdom having been inhibited in Pakistan, the appellant
           did not make a claim for asylum until he was apprehended by  the
           authorities.  I find that the  appellant's  failure  to  make  a
           timely asylum application to be indicative of a person  who  was
           not at risk.   The  appellant  entered  the  United Kingdom  in
           August 2010.  He did not claim asylum until 2016,  I  find  the
           fact that he had no leave at the time that he was encountered by
           the authorities and the failure to make an asylum application to
           be contrary to the actions of a person facing a real risk.

      51.   At question 127 of the asylum interview, the  appellant  claims
           to have spoken to Usman in 2014 about  his  visa  expiring.   He
           attributes the failure to do anything  about  his  visa  to  the
           belief that Usman would be  helping  him  with  his  immigration
           issues.  This is inconsistent with what the  appellant  says  at
           part 1.8 of his screening interview.  There, the  appellant  is
           asked where his passport is.  He answers by saying that he  lost
           his passport in 2013.  I find that it cannot  therefore  be  the
           case that the appellant had expected Usman to  assist  him  with
           his immigration issues in  2014  if  he  had  already  lost  his
           passport by then.

      52.   Despite initially living with a friend in London, the  appellant
           does not then say that  he  felt  free  to  be  open  about  his
           sexuality without repercussions.  The reasons he puts forward is
           the reaction of the community.  Despite living  in  London  away
           from his cousin, the appellant suggests that he  was  not  aware
           that the United Kingdom accepted same-sex relationships.  I  do
           not find this to be credible.  This is because the appellant  is
           an intelligent young man.

      53.   I further find that the appellant has  been  inconsistent  about
           his current relationship with his family.  At part 4.1  of  his
           screening interview,  the  appellant  says  that  he  fears  his
           parents, 2 brothers and his paternal uncle, who will kill  him.
           At question 111 of his asylum interview however, the  appellant
           says that his family told him not to keep in contact  with  them
           after they found out about Usman.

      54.   Having regard to the totality of the information before  me,  it
           is my conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish that
           he is gay, as claimed.  This part of his claim is  quite  simply
           not made out by the evidence.  With the above considerations  in
           mind I am unable  to  accept  the  account  as  representing  an
           accurate picture of his activities either in Pakistan or in  the
           United Kingdom.  I find to the lower standard of proof that the
           appellant has failed to substantiate his account  to  an  extent
           which excludes a finding that he is entitled to protection under
           the Refugee Convention."

6.    The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal contended, in a nutshell,
that the Judge had erred in placing undue reliance upon the content of  the
appellant's  screening  interview  (see  paragraphs  37-40  of  the Judge's
determination) and had further erred in  that  he  had  apparently,  it  was
said, undertaken post-hearing internet research regarding the way  in  which
he thought the appellant could be traced as the viewer  of  gay  pornography
at an internet caf� in Pakistan (see paragraph 41 of  the  determination).
Permission was initially refused by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal  but
was subsequently granted by a judge of the Upper Tribunal who said this:

       "      1.    I  find  it  reasonably   arguable   that   the   First-
      tier Tribunal's adverse findings are undermined by failing to put  to
      the  appellant  arguably  significant  points.   I   am   particularly
      concerned about the Judge's finding  about  how  pornography  can  be
      accessed in Pakistan.  Arguably he should not have made  this  finding
      without asking the appellant to comment.

            2.   I am less impressed with  the  contention  that  the Judge
      gave too  much  weight  to  the  answers  at  a  screening  interview.
      Arguably, admissions are easier to excuse than inconsistencies but  it
      is certainly arguable that the point should have been put,  especially
      as it was not taken in the refusal letter.

            3.   I give permission on all grounds."

7.    There then followed a hearing before the Upper Tribunal  (before  me)
so that the question of whether the Judge had erred in law could be further
considered.  Representation at that hearing was as stated  above  and  I  am
grateful to both representatives for their assistance.

8.    Mr Hussain indicated he would rely upon the grounds of appeal to  the
Upper Tribunal and the terms of the grant  of  permission.   He  contended,
initially, that the  argument  based  upon  post-hearing  research  was  the
strongest.  He said that the points of  concern  regarding  the  pornography
and the inconsistency between what had been said in the screening  interview
and what had been said elsewhere had not been put to the appellant and  this
had resulted in unfairness.  Mr Diwnycz indicated he would  rely  upon  the
content of the rule 24 reply which had been served  in  this  case  and  he
suggested it was not clear that the Judge had indulged in any  post-hearing
internet research.  Finally, Mr Hussain contended that the  points  he  had
made were narrow but powerful ones.

9.    As I indicated to the parties, at the hearing,  I  have  decided  that
the Judge did not err in law.  Dealing firstly with  the  point  concerning
the pornography said to have been accessed  by  the  appellant,  it  is  not
apparent to me that the Judge did carry out any internet research  at  all.
Further, whilst it might be the case  that  he  had  made  some  assumptions
about the way in which a viewer of such pornography  might  be  able  to  be
detected at an internet caf�, it does not  seem  to  me  that  that  was  a
particularly  significant  or  important  factor  in  his  general   adverse
credibility finding.  In looking  at  the  passage  from  the  determination
which I have quoted,  it  is  apparent  that  the Judge  relied  upon  many
different concerns regarding credibility including the improbability of  the
scenario described by the appellant which he had  claimed  had  led  to  the
discovery of him having sex with Azhar and  the  delay  in  claiming  asylum
coupled with an inadequate explanation for that delay.

10.   As to the point concerning what was said in the  screening  interview,
in my judgment it was open to the Judge to  regard  what  was  recorded  as
having been said therein as inconsistent with what  had  been  said  in  the
substantive asylum interview and in his  witness  statement.   It  does  not
appear to have been put to the appellant, at the hearing, that there was  or
may have been such an inconsistency but  the  appellant  has  had  competent
representation throughout these proceedings, the inconsistency was there  to
be seen, and it could have been dealt with but was not. Whilst the  standard
of proof is a low one in international protection cases the burden  is  upon
the  appellant.   Further,  although  the  appellant  seeks  to  rely   upon
JA (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 450 for the proposition that the
content of a screening interview  should  not  ordinarily  be  relied  upon,
there is nothing  said  in  that  judgment  which  actually  prohibits  such
reliance.  It was pointed out therein,  in  the  particular  passage  relied
upon on behalf of the appellant, that decision makers should bear  in  mind
the age and background of an appellant and any limited  command  of  English
as well as the circumstances under which a screening interview  took  place.
However, in this case the appellant was not, at the time  of  his  screening
interview,  an  immature  individual  and  is  clearly  an  intelligent  and
educated man bearing in mind the original basis upon which he  was  admitted
to the UK.  It does not appear he has  a  limited  command  of  the  English
language because he has  been  studying  in  that  language.   Against  that
background I consider it was permissible to rely upon  the  content  of  the
screening interview.

11.    In  general  terms  this  determination  was  careful  and  thorough.
Although a challenge is made to two aspects of  the  credibility  assessment
it is clear that there were a number of other reasons as to  why  the Judge
was not persuaded about the appellant  being  a  witness  of  truth.   I  am
satisfied that when the determination is read as a  whole  it  represents  a
full and fair assessment of the case put forward by and  on  behalf  of  the
appellant.  I would conclude, therefore, that the Judge did not err in  law
and that his decision should, therefore, stand.   Accordingly,  this  appeal
to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of  an
error of law.  Accordingly, it shall stand.

I make no anonymity direction.  None was made  by  the  First-tier Tribunal
and none was sought before me.
