                             NOTICE OF DECISION

 1. Both subparagraphs of rule  40(3)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) apply to this decision.

 2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Lloyd) sent  out  on  17
    August 2018 is erroneous in law.  I set it aside.

 3. The appeal is remitted to be determined by the First-tier  Tribunal  de
    novo at an oral hearing before a judge other than Judge B Lloyd.
