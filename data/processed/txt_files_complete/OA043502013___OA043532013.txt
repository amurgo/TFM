                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants (mother and son) who are citizens of Sri Lanka,  born  7
    November 1972 and 31 August 1994 appeal with permission the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  A  Baldwin  who  for  reasons  given  in  a
    determination dated 14 January 2014 dismissed their appeals against the
    decisions of the Entry Clearance Officer, Chennai.  The appellants  had
    applied for entry clearance to settle in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    spouse and son of Mr K Baskaran (the sponsor).  The application of  the
    second named appellant was refused in line with  that  of  his  mother.
    Her application was refused for the following reasons.

 2. First, a photograph had been presented with the  application  which  on
    examination by a member of the forgery team  in  Colombo  had  led  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to conclude that it  had  been  altered.   Full
    details were contained in a document examination report  retained  with
    the file.  As a false document had been presented the applications were
    refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1(c) of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
    Rules with reference to paragraph S-EC.2.2.

 3. Secondly, because the first  appellant  had  not  provided  a  marriage
    certificate.  The Entry Clearance Officer was not  satisfied  that  she
    was married to a person who was  present  and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  For this reason the application was refused under EC-P.1.1(d)
    of Appendix FM  with  reference  to  E-ECP.2.7.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer observed in his decision that the first  appellant  had  stated
    they had met in 1989 and had fallen in love.  They were married  on  22
    November 1990.  The explanation was that the wedding was a small affair
    in a friend's house without a reception and there were  no  photographs
    of the event.  The sponsor had left Sri Lanka  in  June  1995  and  the
    first appellant had not seen him since May of that year.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer  further  observed  that  the  sponsor  had
    obtained status in 2011 which would have  allowed  him  to  sponsor  an
    application but no application had been made until  more  than  a  year
    later.  The lack of  contact,  financial  support  and  the  length  of
    separation together with the presentation of a "photoshopped"photograph
    led the respondent to doubt  the  parties  intended  to  live  together
    permanently in  the  UK  and  so  the  application  was  refused  under
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM  with  reference  to  E-ECP.2.6  &
    2.10.

 5. Based on the submission of the photograph which had been found  not  to
    be genuine the respondent was not satisfied that the  relationship  was
    genuine and subsisting or that the parties intended  to  live  together
    permanently in the United Kingdom and thus the application was  refused
    with reference to paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of  Appendix  FM  with  further
    reference to E-EC-P.2.6 & 2.10.

 6. Thirdly, because the sponsor had not shown  that  his  income  met  the
    financial  requirements,  in  particular   personal   bank   statements
    corresponding to the same periods as the  wage  slips  which  had  been
    produced as evidence of  the  sponsor's  employment  by  Tesco  and  BP
    Express.  This aspect of the refusal was under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of
    Appendix FM with further reference to E-ECP.3.1.

 7. Fourth, the Entry Clearance Officer  did  not  accept  that  the  first
    appellant had a physical or mental condition which prevented  her  from
    meeting the English language requirement.  He had noted a  letter  from
    New Medical Centre which stated that she was unable  to  study  due  to
    memory problems and was unable  to  travel  for  study  purposes.   The
    respondent  did  not  accept  that  this  made  her  exempt  from   the
    requirement, particularly as she was able to travel to Jaffna in  order
    to enrol biometrics  and  later  for  an  interview.   Accordingly  the
    application of the first appellant  was  refused  under  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM with further reference to E-ECP.4.1.

 8. On receipt of notice of appeal a review was carried  out  by  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager.   In  this,  he  explains  that  he  considered  the
    photograph in question had been provided for the purpose  of  obtaining
    entry clearance and it was therefore relevant to the  application.   In
    the absence of a marriage certificate the appellants had not shown they
    were related as claimed and the presence of children  did  not  confirm
    legal marriage.   There  was  insufficient  evidence  to  consider  the
    relationship based  on  civil  or  partnership.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Manager was nevertheless satisfied that the relationship was subsisting
    in the light of the many money transfers provided.   He  also  accepted
    the appellants may not have applied for settlement at an  earlier  date
    as it was not convenient to do so for educational reasons.

 9. As to the English language requirement, the Entry Clearance Manager was
    satisfied that the doctor's letter in itself did not sufficiently  show
    why the first appellant was unable to undertake  the  English  language
    requirement.

10. As to the financial requirements, the parties were reminded that  there
    was no indication in  the  refusal  notice  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer disputed the income and ability to meet the financial threshold
    of ï¿½22,400 but only that the evidential requirements had not been  met.
    Further employment letters from Tesco and BP Express Shopping  had  not
    been submitted with the appeal.

11. The sponsor appeared at the hearing of the  appeal  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 13 January 2014.  He sought an  adjournment  in  order  for
    representation to be arranged.  The judge decided  however  to  proceed
    with the hearing and dismissed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules
    and on human rights grounds.  The challenge to  that  determination  is
    twofold.

12. The first ground is that the judge erred  in  failing  to  adjourn  the
    hearing.  The verification report in respect of the photograph had  not
    been made available to the sponsor until the morning  of  the  hearing.
    It is argued that although the  sponsor  gave  evidence  regarding  the
    photograph in question, a considerable number of other photographs were
    presented and, had  the  hearing  been  adjourned,  the  appellant  and
    sponsor could have adduced those photographs.  There was a  clear  lack
    of equality of arms at the hearing and as a consequence, the  appellant
    and sponsor were deprived of providing any further evidence in the form
    of photographs.

13. The second ground argues that the judge had failed to  apply  correctly
    the jurisprudence in AA (Nigeria) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2010] EWCA Civ 773 which restricted the application of  the
    Immigration Rules to cases  of  deliberate  falsehood  rather  than  an
    accidental mistake.  The obligation was squarely on the respondent  and
    the Tribunal to  be  satisfied  that  the  appellant  really  did  mean
    dishonesty in the application.  Reference is made to  the  considerable
    evidence placed before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  concerning  the
    genuine and subsisting nature of the relationship.

14. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan on
    25 February 2014.

15. There was no appearance by the sponsor at  the  hearing  before  me.  I
    noted a letter from the appellants' solicitors, Sri  Harans,  dated  27
    March 2014 indicating that their clients had  ceased  to  give  further
    instructions and they asked to be removed from the record.  At 10:40  I
    decided to proceed with the hearing and after hearing submissions  from
    Ms Everett I gave my decision.  I was satisfied that notice of time and
    place of hearing had been given in accordance with the Procedure Rules.



16. In brief, Ms Everett's submissions were that the parties were clear  as
    to which photograph was being discussed and there was no prejudice with
    the way that matters proceeded at the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

17. There is no challenge to the findings by the First-tier Tribunal as  to
    the deficiencies in the appellants' applications under the  Immigration
    Rules apart  from  the  position  regarding  the  photograph.   I  have
    examined the judge's Record of Proceedings in which he has recorded the
    reasons  advanced  by  the  sponsor  for  an  adjournment   to   obtain
    representation.  It does not appear  that  an  adjournment  was  sought
    because of the verification report.  Although it is not clear from  the
    determination that the sponsor was shown the  report  and  accompanying
    photocopy of the photograph, the grounds indicate that there were  made
    available and I approach this is issue on that basis. As it appears the
    application  for  adjournment  was  to  obtain  representation,  I   am
    satisfied that there was no procedural unfairness in the judge deciding
    to proceed; he gave satisfactory reasons for doing so at [5] to [6]  of
    his determination.

18. As to the second ground, the  judge  noted  in  his  determination  the
    evidence of the sponsor.  This  included  the  production  of  a  large
    number of photographs the sponsor had taken whilst he had  visited  Sri
    Lanka recently along with other documentation.  He noted that the s.108
    report set out a  number  of  reasons  for  concluding  that  that  the
    photograph was not genuine.  The officer at the British High Commission
    had found the photograph contained a substitute photograph or image and
    that the husband and wife appeared to have been superimposed  based  on
    the couple appearing to be in different proportions  and  variation  in
    contrast.

19. It was not disputed by the appellants that an  altered  photograph  was
    submitted with the application.  The schedule of documents said to have
    accompanied the application includes reference to just one  photograph.
    It was not until the grounds of appeal that an  explanation  was  given
    for the altered photograph being produced.  It was that  in  order  for
    the children to remember their father as husband and  wife,  the  first
    appellant had joined the two photographs together.  It was argued  that
    there was no forgery as such and it was a harmless act.

20. I am satisfied that the judge was therefore entitled to  conclude  that
    the appeals must fail because of the production of a  photograph  which
    the first appellant knew to be false.  There is no  evidence  that  the
    first appellant explained the position when submitting  the  photograph
    with the application.  As  to  the  sponsor's  assertion  that  several
    photographs had been submitted with the  application,   the  judge  was
    entitled to observe  this  was  implausible  as  no  other  photographs
    appeared in the respondent's bundle.  It  was  open  to  the  judge  to
    observe that if there were other photographs of the couple in the 1990s
    or before, why was it necessary to construct the one in  question.   It
    was also open to the judge on the evidence to conclude that the  reason
    it was provided was to try and make good the paucity of other  evidence
    about the marriage and its subsistence.

21. I am satisfied that the judge was entitled on the evidence to  conclude
    that the photograph as submitted was false in that it tells a lie about
    itself and I am not persuaded that the second ground  of  challenge  is
    any more than an evidential disagreement.

22. My conclusion therefore is that the First-tier Tribunal did not err  on
    the basis alleged in the grounds of  application  and  accordingly  the
    appeals in the Upper Tribunal are dismissed.
