For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Introduction

    1. The appellants are siblings and citizens  of  Eritrea  born,  it  is
       found by the First-tier Tribunal, in 1995  and  1996  in  Riyadh  in
       Saudi Arabia. They came to the UK on 21st March 2017.  They  claimed
       asylum on the same day, and their applications were refused on  13th
       August 2019. Their appeals were dismissed on all grounds  by  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Hatton in a  determination  promulgated  on  the
       13th January 2020. Permission to appeal was granted and I found that
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law for the reasons set out  in
       my decision which is appended to this  decision  as  Annex  A.     I
       confirmed with the parties that neither of them  had  objections  to
       the decision I took under Rule 34 finding an error of law in  light
       of the decision in R (JCWI) v President of UTIAC [2020] EWHC 3103
       (Admin).  The matter comes before me now to remake the appeal.

    2. In light of the need to take precautions against the spread of Covid-
       19 and with regard to the overriding object set  out  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal Procedure Rules to decide matters fairly  and  justly  this
       hearing takes place via  Skype  for  Business,  a  format  to  which
       neither party raised objection. There were no significant issues  of
       connectivity or audibility during the hearing.

    3. This re-making hearing focuses solely on the issue  of  whether  the
       appellants are at real risk of serious harm on return to Eritrea due
       to an obligation to perform military service. It was accepted by  Mr
       Lindsay that if  the  appellants  could  show  to  the  lower  civil
       standard of proof that they would have to perform  military  service
       if returned to Eritrea  they  were  entitled  to  succeed  in  their
       protection appeals. He explicitly did not seek  to  argue  that  the
       appellants could find safety by returning to Saudi Arabia where they
       had previously held residence permits as  family  members  of  their
       father.

    4. Directions were issued with the decision finding  an  error  of  law
       promulgated on 18th September  2020.  A  response  was  received  on
       behalf of the appellants from their counsel, Mr B  Hawkin,  but  not
       from the respondent. It was decided by Mr Hawkin  that  he  did  not
       need to call further evidence from the appellants, and so the appeal
       proceeded by way of submissions only. The appellants' solicitors had
       lodged a large bundle of background evidence at a late stage, but Mr
       Hawkin accepted that none of this went  to  the  only  issue  to  be
       determined as outline above, and he did  not  refer  to  it  in  his
       submissions at all. It was discussed with both parties as to whether
       the expert report of Dr Imranali  Panjwani,  which  was  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal, was of assistance in the determination  of  the
       appeal before me but ultimately Mr Hawkin decided that  it  was  not
       something which would assist the Upper Tribunal.

    Submissions - Remaking

    5. It is argued  by  Mr  Lindsay,  for  the  respondent,  that  as  the
       appellants were not found to be credible  witnesses  therefore  they
       cannot, to the lower civil standard of proof, show that they are  at
       risk of forced labour/military service as outlined in MST and Others
       at paragraph 431(7)(iii) because they have not shown  that  they  do
       not fall into the exceptions to risk, namely: persons who  are  seen
       by the regime as  giving  Eritrea  valuable  service  abroad  or  in
       Eritrea; persons who are family members of the regime's military  or
       political leadership; or children of persons who fled Eritrea during
       the War of Independence

    6. It is argued by Mr Lindsay that the First-tier Tribunal  found  that
       the appellants were born, in 1995 and  1996,  and  raised  in  Saudi
       Arabia and were granted lawful residence with their family  to  live
       there until 8th February 2020. They were  not  found  to  have  been
       deported to Eritrea in 2016 and did not experience persecution there
       as they had claimed, and either they had not been there at  all,  or
       it was possible that the appellants' had travelled  to  Eritrea  for
       two weeks and stayed  there  without  issue.  As  a  result,  it  is
       submitted, it was clearly found that the appellants had  lied  about
       their ages and their history and produced false documents to support
       their fabricated history of persecution, and so were  rightly  found
       by the First-tier Tribunal not to be credible witnesses.  They  only
       succeeded in convincing  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  relation  to
       matters proven by evidence from the respondent.

    7. As a result, it is argued, this appeal cannot succeed by  virtue  of
       the appellants own evidence as no weight  can  be  placed  upon  it.
       Reliance is placed on the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  MA
       (Somalia) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 49, particularly at  paragraphs  21  to
       48, in support  of  the  contention  that  these  appellants  cannot
       succeed because the burden is on them to show that they do not  fall
       into the three categories of exception as they lack any  country  of
       origin/ documentary evidence which could show that they do not  fall
       within these exceptions, and given the lack of weight to be afforded
       to their own evidence. It is accepted that  many  Eritreans  do  not
       fall within  these  categories  providing  exemption  from  military
       service but this alone is not sufficient for the appellants to  show
       to the lower civil standard that they do not.

    8. Mr Lindsay did not, however, strongly argued that they  cannot  show
       that they are not persons who have given  Eritrea  valuable  service
       abroad given their age. However, it  is  argued  that  there  is  no
       corroborating evidence of the work their father does in Saudi Arabia
       and so that they have failed  to  show  that  they  are  not  family
       members of the regimes' military or political leadership. They could
       be the children of a diplomat, military attach� or a  spy  based  in
       Saudi Arabia. The work permit documents  for  their  father  do  not
       specify that he does a particular job, and there is no evidence that
       this is not the type of work permit  held  by  those  involved  with
       diplomatic work in Saudi Arabia. Further it is  also  possible  that
       their father travelled backwards and forwards from Saudi  Arabia  to
       Eritrea so was not permanently abroad. It is argued  that  there  is
       also no evidence that they are not the children of persons who  fled
       Eritrea during the war of independence as there is no  corroborative
       evidence of when their parents left Eritrea, and their own  evidence
       that this was in the mid 1990s is  not  reliable  as  they  are  not
       credible witnesses and no weight should be given to  that  of  their
       uncle, Mr S O, as he has not given oral evidence or even signed  his
       statement.

    9. It is argued for the appellants by Mr Hawkin that they would  be  at
       real risk of being forced to perform military service in Eritrea  if
       returned there because they do not fall within the exceptions.  They
       are not from an important family connected to the Eritrean  military
       or political leadership. It is said by  the  appellants  that  their
       father was a driver for a big  medical  services  company  in  Saudi
       Arabia who took businessmen  from  the  airport  in  Riyadh  to  the
       company headquarters and who later had a different job filling water
       tanks with clean water. It is argued that it is  not  even  possible
       that the appellants'  parents  are  military  or  political  leaders
       because such people would not be based abroad, and  there  is  clear
       and accepted evidence that the appellants had work permits to be  in
       Saudi Arabia and had lived there with their parents, possibly bar  a
       couple of weeks in 2016. It is also argued that the  family  of  the
       appellants did not leave Eritrea due  to  the  war  of  independence
       between 1962 and 1991 but simply to work in low level employment  in
       Saudi Arabia in  the  mid  1990s,  just  before  the  birth  of  the
       appellants. This is the evidence of their uncle, S O, although it is
       accepted that he  did  not  give  evidence  and  his  statement  was
       unsigned. In any case  this  exception  is  put  forward  with  less
       certainty in the country guidance than the first two so it should be
       found that the appellants have done sufficient to show that they  do
       not fall within it.

   10. At the end of hearing I reserved my decision.

     Conclusions - Error of Law

   11. MST and Others (national  service  -  risk  categories)  Eritrea  CG
       [2016] UKUT 00443 finds that: "While likely to be a rare case, it is
       possible that a person who  has  exited  lawfully  may  on  forcible
       return face having to resume or commence national service. In such a
       case there is a real risk of persecution or serious harm  by  virtue
       of such service constituting forced labour contrary to Article  4(2)
       and Article 3 of the ECHR"; and further at 7(iii):  " It remains the
       case (as in MO) that there are persons likely not  to  face  a  real
       risk of persecution or serious harm notwithstanding that  they  will
       be perceived on return as draft evaders and deserters,  namely:  (1)
       persons  whom  the  regime's  military  and   political   leadership
       perceives as having given them valuable service (either  in  Eritrea
       or abroad); (2) persons who are trusted family members  of,  or  are
       themselves part of, the regime's military or  political  leadership.
       A  further  possible  exception,  requiring  a  more  case  specific
       analysis is (3) persons (and their  children  born  afterwards)  who
       fled (what later became the territory of) Eritrea during the War  of
       Independence

   12. The appellants are citizens of Eritrea and that they are of  an  age
       where they would be liable for military service, the upper age limit
       for military service for men being 54;  and  the  appellants  having
       been found to have been born and lived  all  their  lives  in  Saudi
       Arabia and so clearly not to have completed military service. It  is
       rightly accepted by the respondent therefore that  these  appellants
       can succeed in their protection appeal if they can show that they do
       not fall into one of the 7(iii) categories.

   13. Mr Lindsay has drawn my attention to MA (Somalia) v SSHD [2010] UKSC
       49,  which  was  relied  upon  in  the  submissions  of  Mr   Jarvis
       challenging the application for permission to  appeal.  The  Supreme
       Court finds that where an appellant tells lies he may well be unable
       to satisfy even the lower civil standard of proof  as  his  evidence
       will not enable the Tribunal to make the relevant findings, and that
       this will be the case even, as in  these  circumstances,  where  the
       appellant needs only to show he does not fall into a number of small
       categories which not many appellants would be likely to be  included
       within. It is also said that where an appellant tells lies they will
       only likely to be saved by very strong general evidence. I am guided
       by MA(Somalia) in  determining  this  appeal,  and  start  from  the
       position that the appellants own evidence is to be given  no  weight
       beyond the facts accepted by the First-tier Tribunal, which in  turn
       were those founded on the respondent's evidence, and that they  will
       only be able to succeed if sufficient  accepted  country  of  origin
       evidence exists to show that they do not fall within  the  exemption
       categories or for other reasons relating to the facts found  by  the
       First-tier Tribunal it is demonstrated to the lower  civil  standard
       of proof that they do not.

   14. The appellants are found to be 25 and 26 years old. They came to the
       UK in March 2017 when they were 21 and 22 years old, and  have  been
       found to have lived in Saudi Arabia with their family all  of  their
       lives, bar a possible couple of weeks, as their father  had  a  work
       permit there and they were entitled to remain  as  his  family.  The
       appellants, I find, are therefore very young and  in  addition  they
       are not well educated people:  their  educational  achievements,  as
       evidenced by their certificates for their examination results in the
       UK in the home office bundle before the First-Tier Tribunal, are not
       good, with the exception of their ability in Arabic which is clearly
       explained by their having lived all their lives in Saudi Arabia.  Mr
       Lindsay did not argue strongly that the appellants should  be  found
       to fall within this category. I find that they  have  shown  to  the
       lower civil standard of proof on the basis of their youth  and  lack
       of substantial educational achievement in the UK that they  are  not
       persons who have given valuable service to the Eritrean  government,
       either in Eritrea or abroad, and thus do not fall within  the  first
       exemption from military service.

   15. The second category of exemption raises the question as  to  whether
       the appellants are  trusted  family  members  of  the  military  and
       political leadership of Eritrea. This firstly raises the question as
       to what is meant by the Eritrean military or  political  leadership.
       Can diplomats or other servants of the Eritrean state living  abroad
       properly be seen as part of the leadership of Eritrea,  or  is  this
       category of persons confined  to  senior  members  of  the  Eritrean
       government and army who are based within Eritrea? The Upper Tribunal
       in MST at paragraphs 244-245 found that Eritrea  is  a  closed,  one
       party state, and that there was no functioning legislature  and  the
       National Assembly was suspended. Eritrea  has,  since  independence,
       been led by Isaias Afwerke, who is president and commander in  chief
       of the armed forces. The dictionary definition  of  "leadership"  is
       the leaders, or those in charge,  of  an  organisation  or  country.
       Whilst it is possible that the appellants' father was not a low paid
       worker in Saudi Arabia with a work permits as they contend, and that
       he might have been  a  diplomat/military  attach�  or  spy  possibly
       moving between that country and Eritrea (although it is the position
       of the respondent in the reasons for refusal letter at paragraph  45
       that the appellants' father lives and works in Saudi Arabia),  I  do
       not find that such people can properly be defined as those in charge
       of Eritrea, in light of the information about its  political  system
       as set out in MST and because such people are  categories  of  civil
       servant who carry out the business of government rather than leaders
       deciding upon the policy of government. I  find  therefore  on  this
       basis that the appellants are not  trusted  family  members  of  the
       military and political leadership of Eritrea.

   16. Further, I find it would be highly unlikely that if the  appellants'
       father was a trusted military or political leader in Eritrea that he
       would not have  preferred  to  use  legal  routes,  such  as  study,
       business or work, to move his sons to the UK if that  had  been  his
       wish. I further find that it would be most improbable that he  would
       have sent them to the UK to claim asylum  using  a  most  precarious
       illegal route via the  Jungle  in  France  with  all  the  attendant
       dangers that would have exposed them  too.  It  is  clear  that  the
       respondent accepts that they travelled  to  the  UK  via  Italy  and
       France, as set out at paragraph 51 of the reasons for refusal letter
       and I find that there is evidence, which was before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal in the respondent's bundle, from Rosie Pope of Safe Passage
       UK in a signed statement of truth dated 6th February 2017  that  she
       encountered both of the appellants in the Jungle as part of her work
       for Legal Shelter, as they were on a list of children who were  been
       considered for transfer to the  UK.  It  is  also  accepted  by  the
       respondent that the appellants were  brought  to  the  UK  under  EU
       Dublin III  provisions  from  the  reasons  to  refusal  letters  at
       paragraphs 27/ 29.

   17. I am therefore satisfied to  the  lower  civil  standard  of  proof,
       having  considered  both  the  definition,  the  country  of  origin
       evidence set out in MST and the risks inherent  in  the  appellants'
       route to the UK that the appellants do not fall within the exclusion
       from being at risk  from  military  service  based  on  their  being
       trusted family members of the military and political  leadership  of
       Eritrea.

   18. The final possible category by which the appellants could be  exempt
       from risk from having to do military service is if they  are  family
       members of those who left Eritrea during the  war  of  independence,
       which lasted from 1962 to 1991. This is described  more  cautiously,
       as a possible exception requiring more case specific  analysis.  The
       appellants' own evidence is that their parents  left  Eritrea  after
       this war in the mid 1990s, but I cannot place weight on this due  to
       the negative credibility findings by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
       evidence of their uncle, Mr S O, is  that  the  appellants'  parents
       married in Sudan in 1993 and travelled  to  Saudi  Arabia  in  1994.
       Again, I cannot place weight on this evidence, despite the potential
       consistency with the appellants position, as the  statement  is  not
       signed and Mr S O, gave no evidence to the  First-tier  Tribunal  or
       before me. Turning to the decision in MST at  paragraphs  351-353  I
       find that the evidence in the country guidance case  indicates  that
       it was envisaged that the group potentially  gaining  protection  in
       this way were the Eritrean diaspora who have settled  abroad  during
       the war of independence and naturalised in their country  of  exiled
       residence, or perhaps who have obtained settlement in that  country,
       and who make up a substantial number of people  going  to  and  from
       Eritrea for holidays. They would of course be returning  voluntarily
       and seemingly with the protective element of their other nationality
       or residency rights, or their useful  generation  of  funds  through
       tourism. I do not find that  the  appellants  have  other  residency
       rights as the evidence before  me  is  that  their  Saudi  residence
       permits expired in February 2020,  and  it  was  not  argued  by  Mr
       Lindsay that they could now return to Saudi Arabia, and I find  that
       they hold no other nationality. Given the caution  with  which  this
       exemption is put forward I find that the appellants  have  shown  to
       the lower civil standard of proof that they do not  fall  into  this
       category of person excluded from risk of  military  service  on  the
       basis of the material elucidating it in MST.

   19. It follows that I find that the appellants are entitled  to  succeed
       in their protection appeal based on their liability to  do  military
       service placing them at real risk of serious harm under  Articles  3
       and 4 ECHR if returned to Eritrea.

      Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
      appeal.

   3. I remake the appeal by allowing it under Articles 3 and 4 ECHR.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellants are siblings and citizens  of  Eritrea  born,  it  is
       found by the First-tier Tribunal, in 1995  and  1996  in  Riyadh  in
       Saudi Arabia. They came to the UK on 21st March 2017.  They  claimed
       asylum on the same day, and their applications were refused on  13th
       August 2019. Their appeals were dismissed on all grounds  by  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Hatton in a  determination  promulgated  on  the
       13th January 2020.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary of State by  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Coker on 3rd April 2020 on  limited  grounds  on  the
       sole basis that it is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal erred in
       failing to engage with the issue of military service.

    3. In light of the need to take precautions against the spread of Covid-
       19 and with regard to the overriding object set  out  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  to  decide  matters  fairly  and  justly
       directions were sent out to the parties by email on 3rd  April  2020
       by Judge Coker with  her  grant  of  permission  to  appeal  seeking
       written submissions on the assertion of an error of law with a  view
       to determining that issue on the papers, and giving  an  opportunity
       for any party who felt that a hearing was necessary in the interests
       of justice to make submissions on that  issue  too.  Responses  were
       received from both parties: from  Mr  I  Jarvis,  Senior  Presenting
       Officer, dated 21st July 2020 for  the  respondent  and  from  Mr  B
       Hawkins, of Counsel, dated 15th July 2020 and 29th July 2020 for the
       appellants.

    4. I must determine whether it is in the interests of justice to decide
       this matter without a hearing, and if so then determine whether  the
       First-tier Tribunal has erred in law. The respondent does not object
       to the matter being determined on the  papers  submitting  that  the
       appeals relate to a narrow issue perfectly capable of being resolved
       by written argument. The appellants request an oral hearing as it is
       said that the appeal is of overwhelming importance to the appellants
       given that it concerns their fundamental human rights. It is  argued
       that in these circumstances counsel ought to be able  to  make  oral
       submissions via video link on the core  issues  and  other  relevant
       matters. I give weight to the fact that serious human rights  issues
       are raised in this appeal, but find that it is appropriate that this
       stage of the proceedings is dealt with on  the  papers  as  all  the
       necessary arguments are put forward in writing and it  is  indeed  a
       narrow discrete issue which can fairly and justly be decided in this
       way, with  the  advantage  of  providing  swifter  justice  for  the
       parties.



Submissions - Error of Law

    5. As noted above the grant of permission to appeal was only in respect
       to it being arguable that the issue of military service had not been
       engaged with by the First-tier Tribunal. With respect to this  issue
       it is argued by the appellants that they are found by that  Tribunal
       to be of an age where they would  clearly  be  liable  to  undertake
       military service in Eritrea and that  in  accordance  with  MST  and
       Others (national service - risk categories) Eritrea CG  [2016]  UKUT
       00443 that return to Eritrea was therefore likely to be a breach  of
       the Refugee Convention and/or Articles 3  and  8  of  ECHR.  In  the
       further submissions of 29th July 2020 it is argued that the error of
       law is highly material as the appellants do not fall within  any  of
       the exceptions to risk category outlined in MST and Others.

    6. In the submissions for the respondent it is argued that  permissions
       is only granted on the one ground in a way compliant with Safi & Ors
       (permission to appeal decisions) [2018] UKUT 388 and so there is  no
       scope for the appellants to persist with the grounds other than  the
       one related to military service.  This  is  not  challenged  in  the
       submissions put forward on behalf of the appellants.

    7. It is argued by the respondent that it  is  properly  found  by  the
       First-tier Tribunal that the appellants were born, in 1995 and 1996,
       and raised in Saudi Arabia and were granted  lawful  residence  with
       their family to live there until 8th February 2020.  They  were  not
       found to  have  been  deported  to  Eritrea  in  2016  and  did  not
       experience persecution there as they had claimed,  and  either  they
       had not been there at all, or it was possible that  the  appellants'
       had travelled to Eritrea for two  weeks  and  stayed  there  without
       issue. As  a  result,  it  is  submitted,  it  was  clear  that  the
       appellants had lied about their ages and their history, and produced
       false documents to support their fabricated history of persecution.

    8. It is accepted for  the  respondent  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       failed to deal with the issue of military service  directly  in  the
       decision. It is argued however that this was not a material error of
       law as the appeal could not have  been  allowed  with  reference  to
       Articles 3 and 4 of the ECHR in any case for the following  reasons.
       The appellants did not leave Eritrea illegally as they were born  in
       Saudi Arabia. They have been found not to be credible witnesses  and
       to have lied about having difficulties in  Eritrea.  They  therefore
       cannot, to the lower civil standard of proof, show that they are  at
       risk of forced labour/military service as outlined in MST and Others
       at paragraph 431(7)(iii) because they have not shown  that  they  do
       not fall into the exceptions to risk namely: persons who are seen by
       the regime as giving Eritrea valuable service abroad or in  Eritrea;
       persons who are family members of the regime's military or political
       leadership; children of persons who fled Eritrea during the  War  of
       Independence.

   Conclusions - Error of Law

    9. It is not argued by the  respondent  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       determined the issue of whether the appellants would be at risk of a
       breach  of  their  fundamental  human  rights  by  virtue  of  their
       obligation to perform military service in  Eritrea.  It  is  clearly
       accepted by both parties that the First-tier Tribunal found that the
       appellants are citizens of Eritrea and that they are of an age where
       they would be  liable  for  military  service,  the  age  limit  for
       military service for men being 54, and the  appellants  having  been
       found to have been born and lived all their lives  in  Saudi  Arabia
       and so clearly not to have completed military service. It is not the
       case that the lack of an illegal entry  means  that  the  appellants
       cannot be at real risk of serious harm for this reason  if  returned
       to Eritrea as it is found in MST and Others:

            "11. While likely to be a rare case,  it  is  possible  that  a
            person who has exited lawfully  may  on  forcible  return  face
            having to resume or commence national service. In such  a  case
            there is a real risk of persecution or serious harm  by  virtue
            of such service constituting forced labour contrary to  Article
            4(2) and Article 3 of the ECHR."

   10. The respondent argues that the appellants have not shown  that  they
       do not fall within one of  the  exceptions  to  risk  from  military
       service at 7(iii) of the MST and Others country guidance  head  note
       but I do not find that there are any findings in the decision of the
       First-tier Tribunal which would lead to that conclusion.  There  are
       no findings that the appellants or there  family  are  seen  by  the
       Eritrea regime as giving valuable service at home or  abroad;  there
       are no findings  that  they  are  family  members  of  the  regime's
       military or political leadership;  or  that  they  are  children  of
       persons who fled Eritrea during the War of Independence.

   11. As such I find that it cannot be said that the error of law, in  not
       determining the issue of whether the appellants are at real risk  of
       serious harm if returned to Eritrea by reason  of  their  having  to
       perform military  service,  was  not  potentially  material  to  the
       outcome of the appeal, as the relevant findings  of  fact  have  not
       been made and so the outcome  of  the  appeal  might  be  different,
       notwithstanding  the  issues  with  the   appellants'   credibility,
       particularly as the above factors appear to be ones which  might  be
       shown, in part  at  least,  with  reference  to  country  of  origin
       materials.

   12. For the sake of clarity the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
       set aside but all findings of the First-tier Tribunal are  preserved
       bar that at paragraph 77 of the decision that refers in  passing  to
       military service and any other finding in so far as it may be  taken
       as referring to a lack of risk of serious harm on return due to  the
       appellants obligations to complete military service.







   Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
      appeal.

   3. I adjourn the remaking of the appeal.

   Directions

   1.  In the light of the present need  to  take  precautions  against  the
      spread of Covid-19, and the  overriding  objective  expressed  in  the
      Procedure Rules[1], the parties are required to  co-operate  with  the
      Tribunal in identifying the specific legal issues and the scope of the
      factual disputes.

   2. I therefore make the following DIRECTIONS:

        i) The parties shall, not later than 21 days after this  notice  is
           sent out (the date of sending  is  on  the  covering  letter  or
           covering email), send to each other and file with this  Tribunal
           their written submissions on:

           a. the legal issues, propositions and areas of  factual  dispute
              which the Tribunal should resolve  in  remaking  the  appeal.
              They appear, in this case, to be relatively narrow in  scope,
              namely how it is argued that the appellants are/ are  not  at
              real risk of serious harm on return to Eritrea as a result of
              the obligation to do military service and how  it  is  argued
              that they do not/ do fall within the exceptions to such risk;

           b. the nature of the evidence that they believe is necessary for
              determination of the legal issues, propositions and areas  of
              factual dispute identified;

           c. their views on whether a resumed  hearing  is  necessary,  or
              whether remaking can be resolved  on  the  basis  of  written
              evidence and submissions;

           d. if they believe that a hearing is necessary, their ability to
              participate in a resumed hearing via Skype, or  another  form
              of remote hearing, or their preference for  a  face  to  face
              hearing with reasons why this is to  be  preferred,  and  the
              available dates  of  their  representatives  and  parties  to
              attend a hearing in  the  period  from  14  September  to  18
              December 2020.

           e. The parties' representatives are  required  to  confirm  that
              they can participate in a hearing  via  Skype;  and  also  to
              confirm the up-to-date  contact  details  of  the  individual
              representative with conduct  of  the  case,  including  Skype
              address and direct telephone number, at  which  they  can  be
              contacted.

       ii) On receipt of the parties' submissions, the Tribunal  will  then
           consider whether a  case  management  hearing  is  necessary  or
           whether the appeal can simply be listed for a remaking  hearing,
           in one of the three  potential  forms  outlined  above,  with  a
           direction that the  appellant  file  and  serve  a  consolidated
           bundle of relevant documents 10 days prior to that hearing.  Any
           case management hearing is likely  to  be  either  by  telephone
           conference call or Skype.

      iii) Documents and submissions filed in response to these  directions
           may be sent by, or attached to, an email to  [email]  using  the
           Tribunal's  reference  number  (found  at  the  top   of   these
           directions) as the subject line.  Attachments must not exceed 15
           MB.  Service on the Secretary of State should be to [email]  and
           to the appellant by way of any email address apparent  from  the
           service of these directions.
