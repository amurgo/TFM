Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involves protection issues. It is appropriate to  continue  the  order.
Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any member of his family. This direction  applies
both to the Appellant and to the Respondent. Failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                                  DECISION

    1. This is the decision of  us  all.   The  section  dealing  with  the
       applicable burden and standard of proof  was  primarily  written  by
       Lane J and the remainder of the decision was written by  UTJ  Smith.
       The section setting out the submissions made concerning the facts of
       the case was drafted shortly after the hearing.


    BACKGROUND


    2. The Appellant is a national of  Egypt  born  in  January  2001.   He
       arrived in the UK in August 2014, aged thirteen years.   He  claimed
       asylum on the following day.  He initially claimed to be Syrian  but
       subsequently disclosed his true identity.  His claim now is based on
       a dispute relating to land he claims  to  have  inherited  from  his
       parents.  He says that this dispute led to threats to his life which
       forced him to leave Egypt where he was living  with  his  uncle  and
       sisters.  He claims that both his  parents  are  dead.   On  a  more
       general level, the Appellant also claims that he  has  lost  contact
       with his uncle and siblings in Egypt, that he  would  be  forced  to
       live alone in Cairo as a result and would be destitute.   He  claims
       to be entitled to humanitarian protection on that account.


    3. The Appellant appeals against the  Respondent's  decision  dated  13
       November 2015 refusing his protection and human rights claim.

    4. By a decision promulgated on 19 May 2016, the Appellant's appeal was
       initially allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Graham to the  extent
       that the case was remitted to the  Respondent  for  reconsideration.
       However, that  decision  was  set  aside  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
       Rimington on 3 August 2016 on the basis that the Tribunal had  acted
       outside its jurisdiction by allowing the appeal on that basis.   The
       appeal was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to decide afresh.


    5. The Appellant's appeal was dismissed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Robertson by a decision promulgated on 21 March 2017.  By a decision
       promulgated on 8 December 2017, Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor  found
       an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision  and  set  the
       First-tier Tribunal's decision aside.  He directed that the decision
       should be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.

    6. The appeal in this case was conjoined with  another  appeal  raising
       the same issue concerning the appropriate  burden  and  standard  of
       proof in relation to protection appeals.  That  is  the  Appellant's
       ground one in this case.  We deal  with  that  ground  first  before
       proceeding to re-make the decision  as  the  issue  of  the  correct
       burden and standard of proof is relevant to our determination of the
       claim.


      BURDEN AND STANDARD OF PROOF

    7. An appellant in a human rights appeal who asserts that  his  or  her
       removal from the United Kingdom would violate Article 3 of the  ECHR
       must establish that claim. In other words, the appellant  bears  the
       burden of proof.  The standard of proof  requires the  appellant  to
       show a "reasonable likelihood" or "real risk" of Article 3 harm.

    8. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal  so  held  in  Kacaj  (Article  3  -
       Standard of Proof - Non-State Actors) Albania*  [2001]  UKIAT  00018
       ("Kacaj").  At paragraph 12 of its determination, the IAT said  that
       "the standard may be a  relatively  low  one,  but  it  is  for  the
       applicant to establish his claim to that standard".

    9. Section 107(3) and (3A) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
       Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") provides  that  practice  directions  made
       under section 23 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007
       may require the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal to  treat
       a specified decision  of,  amongst  other  bodies,  the  Immigration
       Appeal Tribunal, as authoritative in respect of a particular matter.



   10. Practice Direction 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of  the
       First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal provides that a  reported
       determination of, inter alia, the IAT which is  "starred"  shall  be
       treated as authoritative in respect  of  the  matter  to  which  the
       "starring" relates, unless inconsistent with other authority that is
       binding on the Tribunal.

   11. It is undisputed that  Kacaj  is  "starred"  for  what  it  says  in
       paragraph 12 of the determination.  There is no  domestic  case  law
       that is inconsistent with Kacaj.  On the contrary, the higher courts
       consistently follow the same approach.  Thus,  for  example,  in  AM
       (Zimbabwe) and Another v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
       [2018] EWCA Civ 64, Sales LJ held:-

         "16.     It is common ground that where a foreign national seeks to
             rely upon Article 3 as an answer to an attempt by a  state  to
             remove him into another country, the overall legal  burden  is
             on him to show that Article 3 would be infringed in  his  case
             by showing that there are substantial  grounds  for  believing
             that he would face a real risk of being subject to torture  or
             to inhuman or degrading treatment in that other country ..."

   12. In the light of this, Mr Bedford  accepts,  as  he  must,  that  the
       Appellant has a burden to discharge. He submits, however, that  what
       he describes as  the  "standard  direction  on  appeal  against  the
       refusal of an international protection claim" needs modification  in
       order to take account of what he says is the "clear and  consistent"
       line that has emerged from the European Court of Human Rights in the
       past decade. In this regard, Mr Bedford places  particular  reliance
       upon the judgment of the Grand Chamber in JK  and  Others  v  Sweden
       (Application no. 59166/12) ("JK"), given on 23 August 2016.

   13. According to Mr Bedford, JK holds that the burden on applicants  for
       international protection is discharged  when  they  adduce  evidence
       which is "capable of proving" a real risk on return.  At this point,
       the burden  shifts  to  the  government  to  dispel  any  doubts  or
       uncertainty.

   14. Mr Bedford further submits that :-

         "Any new or modified direction in the Tribunal on  the  burden  and
         standard of proof must take account of the effect  of  the  Supreme
         Court decision in R (Kiarie); R (Byndloss) v SSHD ...  [2017]  UKSC
         42 at [54], [35] that for the purposes of section 82 [of  the  2002
         Act] any proposed appeal must  be  taken  to  be  arguable  in  the
         absence of a certificate that it is clearly unfounded."

   15. The "hard" form  of  Mr  Bedford's  submission  (to  adopt  his  own
       description) is, accordingly, that whenever the  respondent  decides
       not to certify  a  human  rights  claim  (at  least,  one  involving
       international  protection),  that  claim  must,  logically,  involve
       "evidence capable of proving" the appellant's case, with the  result
       that the ensuing appeal is one in which the  respondent  necessarily
       bears the burden of dispelling "any doubts about it".

   16. To use again Mr Bedford's terminology, the "softer" version  of  his
       submission acknowledges that, even where a claim is not certified as
       clearly unfounded, the appellant may, in certain circumstances, bear
       the burden of proof throughout.  However, as we understand  him,  Mr
       Bedford submits that an appellant whose case is not confined to  his
       or her own statements but  is  supported  by  documentary  or  other
       evidence,  has  discharged  the  burden,  so  that  it  is  for  the
       respondent to dispel any doubts or uncertainty.  Mr Bedford  relies,
       in this regard,  on  Article  4.5  of  the  Qualification  Directive
       (Council Directive 2004/83/AEC).

    Article 4(5) of the Qualification Directive

   17. Article 4 of the Directive provides as follows :-

         "Article 4


         Assessment of facts and circumstances


          1. Member States may consider it the duty  of  the  applicant  to
             submit as soon as possible all elements needed to substantiate
             the application for international protection.  In  cooperation
             with the applicant it is the  duty  of  the  Member  State  to
             assess the relevant elements of the application.


          2. The elements  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  consist  of  the
             applicant's  statements   and   all   documentation   at   the
             applicant's   disposal   regarding   the   applicant's    age,
             background, including that of  relevant  relatives,  identity,
             nationality(ies),  country(ies)  and  place(s)   of   previous
             residence,  previous  asylum  applications,   travel   routes,
             identity and travel documents and the reasons for applying for
             international protection.


          3. The assessment of an application for international  protection
             is to be carried out  on  an  individual  basis  and  includes
             taking into account:

               a) all relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin
                  at the time of  taking  a  decision  on  the  application;
                  including laws and regulations of the  country  of  origin
                  and the manner in which they are applied;


             (b) the relevant statements and documentation presented by the
                  applicant including information on whether  the  applicant
                  has been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm;


             (c) the individual position and personal circumstances of  the
                  applicant, including factors such  as  background,  gender
                  and age, so as to assess whether,  on  the  basis  of  the
                  applicant's personal circumstances, the acts to which  the
                  applicant has been or could be  exposed  would  amount  to
                  persecution or serious harm;


             (d) whether  the  applicant's  activities  since  leaving  the
                  country of origin were engaged in for  the  sole  or  main
                  purpose of creating the necessary conditions for  applying
                  for international protection,  so  as  to  assess  whether
                  these activities will expose the applicant to  persecution
                  or serious harm if returned to that country;


             (e) whether the applicant  could  reasonably  be  expected  to
                  avail himself of the protection of another  country  where
                  he could assert citizenship.


         4.  The  fact  that  an  applicant  has  already  been  subject  to
             persecution or serious harm  or  to  direct  threats  of  such
             persecution or such harm,  is  a  serious  indication  of  the
             applicant's well-founded fear of persecution or real  risk  of
             suffering serious harm,  unless  there  are  good  reasons  to
             consider that such persecution or serious  harm  will  not  be
             repeated.

         5. Where Member States apply the principle according to which it is
             the duty of the applicant to substantiate the application  for
             international protection and where aspects of the  applicant's
             statements are not supported by documentary or other evidence,
             those aspects shall not need confirmation, when the  following
             conditions are met:


             (a) the applicant has made a genuine  effort  to  substantiate
                  his application;


               b) all relevant elements, at the applicant's  disposal,  have
                  been submitted, and a satisfactory  explanation  regarding
                  any lack of other relevant elements has been given;

             (c)  the applicant's statements are found to be  coherent  and
                  plausible and do not run counter to available specific and
                  general information relevant to the applicant's case;


             (d)  the applicant has applied for international protection at
                  the earliest  possible  time,  unless  the  applicant  can
                  demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and


             (e)   the  general  credibility  of  the  applicant  has  been
                  established." (our emphasis)

   18. Article 4(5) is  given  direct  effect  in  the  United  Kingdom  by
       paragraph 399L of the Immigration Rules :-

         "339L    It is the duty of the person to  substantiate  the  asylum
                claim or establish that  they  are  a  person  eligible  for
                humanitarian protection or substantiate their  human  rights
                claim.  Where aspects of the  person's  statements  are  not
                supported by documentary or other  evidence,  those  aspects
                will  not  need  confirmation  when  all  of  the  following
                conditions are met:

                (i)    the person has made a genuine effort to  substantiate
                    their asylum claim or establish that they are  a  person
                    eligible for humanitarian protection or substantiate his
                    human rights claim;

                (ii)   all material factors at the  person's  disposal  have
                    been submitted, and a satisfactory explanation regarding
                    any lack of other relevant material has been given:

                (iii)  the person's statements are found to be coherent  and
                    plausible and do not run counter to  available  specific
                    and general information relevant to the person's case;

                (iv)   the person has made an  asylum  claim  or  sought  to
                    establish  that  [they  are]  a  person   eligible   for
                    humanitarian protection or made a human rights claim  at
                    the  earliest  possible  time,  unless  the  person  can
                    demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and

                (v)    the  general  credibility  of  the  person  has  been
                    established."

    The UNHCR Note on the Burden and Standard of Proof

   19. As we shall see, Article 4 was considered by the ECtHR  in  JK.   So
       too was the UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of  Proof  in  Refugee
       Claims, where we find the following :-

         "6.      According to  general  legal  principles  of  the  law  of
             evidence, the burden of proof lies on the person who makes the
             assertion.  Thus, in refugee claims, it is the  applicant  who
             has  the  burden  of  establishing  the  veracity  of  his/her
             allegations and the accuracy of the facts on which the refugee
             claim is based.  The burden of  proof  is  discharged  by  the
             applicant rendering a truthful account of  facts  relevant  to
             the claim so that, based on the facts, a proper  decision  may
             be reached.  In view  of  the  particularities  of  a  refugee
             situation, the adjudicator shares the duty  to  ascertain  and
             evaluate all the relevant facts.  This is achieved, to a large
             extent, by the adjudicator being familiar with  the  objective
             situation in the country of origin concerned, being  aware  of
             relevant matters of common knowledge, guiding the applicant in
             providing the relevant information  and  adequately  verifying
             facts alleged which can be substantiated.

         ...

         10.       As  regards   supportive   evidence,   where   there   is
             corroborative  evidence  supporting  the  statements  of   the
             applicant, this would reinforce the veracity of the statements
             made.  On the other  hand,  given  the  special  situation  of
             asylum-seekers, they should not be  required  to  produce  all
             necessary evidence.  In particular, it  should  be  recognised
             that, often, asylum-seekers  would  have  fled  without  their
             personal documents.  Failure to produce  documentary  evidence
             to substantiate oral statements should, therefore, not prevent
             the  claim  from  being  accepted  if  such   statements   are
             consistent with known facts and the general credibility of the
             applicant is good.

         11.      In assessing the overall credibility  of  the  applicant's
             claim, the adjudicator should take into account  such  factors
             as the  reasonableness  of  the  facts  alleged,  the  overall
             consistency  and   coherence   of   the   applicant's   story,
             corroborative evidence adduced by the applicant in support  of
             his/her  statements,  consistency  with  common  knowledge  or
             generally known facts and the known situation in  the  country
             of origin.  Credibility is established where the applicant has
             presented  a  claim  which  is  coherent  and  plausible,  not
             contradicting generally known  facts,  and  therefore  is,  on
             balance, capable of being believed.

         12.      The term 'benefit of the doubt' is used in the context  of
             standard of proof relating to the factual assertions  made  by
             the applicant.  Given that in  refugee  claims,  there  is  no
             necessity for the applicant to  prove  all  facts  to  such  a
             standard that the adjudicator  is  fully  convinced  that  all
             factual assertions  are  true,  there  would  normally  be  an
             element of doubt in the mind of the adjudicator as regards the
             facts  asserted  by  the  applicant.   Where  the  adjudicator
             considers that the applicant's story is on the whole  coherent
             and plausible, any element of doubt should not  prejudice  the
             applicant's claim; that is, the applicant should be given  the
             'benefit of the doubt'."

    Strasbourg case law

   20. The first applicant in JK was a citizen of Iraq who claimed to be in
       need of international protection, but whose claim  was  rejected  by
       Sweden on the basis that he had not shown that he was at  real  risk
       of serious harm in Iraq, were he to be returned  there.   The  ECtHR
       referred to Saadi v Italy (Application no. 31201/06) as stating that
       the relevant standard of proof in Article 3 cases of  this  kind  is
       whether "substantial grounds have been shown for believing that  the
       person in question, if deported, would face a  real  risk  of  being
       subjected to treatment contrary to  Article  3  in  the  destination
       country".

   21. Paragraphs 91 to 98 of the judgment in JK need  to  be  set  out  in
       full:-

         "91.     Regarding the burden of proof in expulsion  cases,  it  is
             the Court's well-established case-law that it is in  principle
             for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of  proving  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she  would
             be exposed to a real risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to  Article  3;  and  that  where  such  evidence  is
             adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any  doubts  about
             it (see F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, � 120;  Saadi  v.  Italy,
             cited above, � 129; NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above,  �
             111; and R.C. v. Sweden, cited above, � 50).

         92.      According to the Court's  case-law,  it  is  incumbent  on
             persons who allege that their  expulsion  would  amount  to  a
             breach  of  Article  3  to  adduce,  to  the  greatest  extent
             practically possible, material and  information  allowing  the
             authorities of the Contracting State concerned, as well as the
             Court, to assess the risk a removal may entail  (see  Said  v.
             the Netherlands, no. 2345/02, � 49, ECHR 2005-VI).  The Court,
             however,  acknowledges  the   fact   that   with   regard   to
             applications for recognition of  refugee  status,  it  may  be
             difficult, if not impossible,  for  the  person  concerned  to
             supply evidence  within  a  short  time,  especially  if  such
             evidence must be obtained from the country from  which  he  or
             she claims to have  fled.   The  lack  of  direct  documentary
             evidence thus cannot be decisive per se (see Bahaddar  v.  the
             Netherlands, 19 February 1998,  �  45,  Reports  1998-I,  and,
             mutatis mutandis, Said, cited above, � 49).

         93.      Owing to the special  situation  in  which  asylum-seekers
             often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them
             the benefit of the doubt when  assessing  the  credibility  of
             their  statements  and  the  documents  submitted  in  support
             thereof. Yet when information is presented which gives  strong
             reasons  to  question  the  veracity  of  an   asylum-seeker's
             submissions,  the  individual  must  provide  a   satisfactory
             explanation for the alleged inaccuracies in those  submissions
             (see F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, � 113; Collins and Akaziebie
             v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007;  and  S.H.H.  v.
             the United Kingdom, no. 60367/10,  �  71,  29  January  2013).
             Even if the applicant's account of  some  details  may  appear
             somewhat implausible, the Court has considered that this  does
             not necessarily detract from the overall  general  credibility
             of the applicant's claim (see Said, cited above,  �  53,  and,
             mutatis mutandis, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, �� 154-155,  26
             July 2005).


         94.      As a general rule, an  asylum-seeker  cannot  be  seen  as
             having discharged the burden of proof until he or she provides
             a substantiated account of an individual,  and  thus  a  real,
             risk of ill-treatment upon  deportation  that  is  capable  of
             distinguishing his or her situation from the general perils in
             the country of destination.


         95.      Moreover, although a number of individual factors may not,
             when considered separately, constitute a real risk,  the  same
             factors may give rise to a real risk when  taken  cumulatively
             and when considered in a situation  of  general  violence  and
             heightened security (see NA.  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  cited
             above, � 130).  The following elements may represent such risk
             factors: previous criminal record and/or arrest  warrant,  the
             age, gender and origin of a returnee, a previous record  as  a
             suspected or actual  member  of  a  persecuted  group,  and  a
             previous asylum claim submitted abroad (see NA. v. the  United
             Kingdom, cited above, �� 143-144 and 146).


         96.      The Court notes that it is the shared duty of  an  asylum-
             seeker  and  the  immigration  authorities  to  ascertain  and
             evaluate  all  relevant  facts  of  the  case  in  the  asylum
             proceedings.  Asylum-seekers are normally the only parties who
             are able to  provide  information  about  their  own  personal
             circumstances.   Therefore,   as   far   as   the   individual
             circumstances are concerned, the burden  of  proof  should  in
             principle lie on the applicants, who must submit, as  soon  as
             possible,  all   evidence   relating   to   their   individual
             circumstances that is needed to substantiate their application
             for  international  protection.   This  requirement  is   also
             expressed both in the UNHCR documents (see paragraph 6 of  the
             UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in  Refugee  Claims
             and paragraph 196 of the  UNHCR  Handbook  and  Guidelines  on
             Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee  Status,  both
             referred to in paragraphs 53-54 above) and in Article 4 � 1 of
             the EU Qualification Directive, as well as in  the  subsequent
             case-law of the CJEU (see paragraphs 47 and 49-50 above).


         97.      However, the rules concerning the burden of  proof  should
             not render ineffective the applicants' rights protected  under
             Article 3 of the Convention.  It is  also  important  to  take
             into account all the difficulties which an  asylum-seeker  may
             encounter abroad when collecting evidence (see Bahaddar, cited
             above � 45, and, mutatis mutandis, Said, cited above,  �  49).
             Both the standards developed by the UNCHR (paragraph 12 of the
             Note  and  paragraph  196  of  the  Handbook,  both  cited  in
             paragraphs 53-54 above) and Article 4 � 5 of the Qualification
             Directive  recognise,  explicitly  or  implicitly,  that   the
             benefit of the  doubt  should  be  granted  in  favour  of  an
             individual seeking international protection.


         98.      The Court notes that, as far  as  the  evaluation  of  the
             general situation  in  a  specific  country  is  concerned,  a
             different approach  should  be  taken.   In  respect  of  such
             matters, the domestic  authorities  examining  a  request  for
             international protection have full access to information.  For
             this  reason,  the  general  situation  in  another   country,
             including the ability of its  public  authorities  to  provide
             protection,  has  to  be  established  proprio  motu  by   the
             competent  domestic  immigration  authorities  (see,   mutatis
             mutandis, H.L.R. v. France, cited above, �  37;  Hilal,  cited
             above, � 60; and Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, �  116).
             A similar approach is advocated in paragraph 6 of  the  above-
             mentioned Note issued by the UNHCR,  according  to  which  the
             authorities adjudicating on an asylum claim have to take  "the
             objective situation in the country of origin  concerned"  into
             account proprio  motu.   Similarly,  Article  4  �  3  of  the
             Qualification Directive requires that "all relevant  facts  as
             they relate to the country of origin" are taken into account."

   22. At paragraph 102, the ECtHR considered the significance of past ill-
       treatment :-

         "102.    The court considers that the fact  of  past  ill-treatment
                provides a strong indication  of  a  future,  real  risk  of
                treatment contrary to  Article  3,  in  cases  in  which  an
                applicant has made a generally coherent and credible account
                of events that is consistent with information from  reliable
                and objective sources about the  general  situation  in  the
                country at issue.  In such circumstances, it will be for the
                government to dispel any doubts about that risk."

   23. At paragraph 106, having noted that the existence of a risk of  ill-
       treatment, so far as the  ECtHR  was  concerned,  must  be  assessed
       primarily with reference to the facts known or which ought  to  have
       been known to the Contracting State at the time  of  expulsion,  the
       court nevertheless noted that, since the applicants had not yet been
       deported, "the question whether they  would  face  a  real  risk  of
       persecution upon their return to Iraq must be examined in the  light
       of the present day situation".

   24. The ECtHR then embarked on that task.  It could see  "no  reason  to
       cast doubt on the [Swedish] Migration  Agency's  findings  that  the
       family have been exposed to the most serious forms of abuses ...  by
       Al-Qaeda from  2004  to  2008"  (paragraph  114).   The  applicants'
       account of what happened  between  2004  and  2010  was,  the  ECtHR
       considered, "generally coherent and credible" and  "consistent  with
       the relevant Country of Origin Information".  This meant that it was
       "therefore for the government to dispel any doubts about that  risk"
       (paragraphs 114, 115).

   25. Looking at the most  recent  objective  international  human  rights
       sources, the ECtHR considered that there were deficits in  both  the
       capacity and integrity  of  the  Iraqi  security  and  legal  system
       (paragraph 120) and that, overall, there was a real  risk  that  the
       Iraqi state would not be able to protect the applicants.

   26. That was the majority view of the ECtHR, reached  by  ten  votes  to
       seven.  Judge Ranzoni, in  a  dissenting  opinion,  considered  that
       paragraph 102 of the majority judgment lacked  sufficient  reasoning
       and diverged from Article 4.4 of the Qualification  Directive  in  a
       number of respects.

   27. RC v Sweden (Application no. 41827/07) is a judgment  of  the  third
       section of the ECtHR.  It  concerned  an  individual,  RC,  who  was
       present in Sweden  and  claimed  to  be  in  need  of  international
       protection from the authorities in Iran.  Before the First  Instance
       Migration Court in Sweden, the credibility of RC was examined.   Two
       of the three judges of that Court found RC's account was incredible;
       but one dissented from that conclusion.

   28. At paragraph 50 of  its  judgment,  the  ECtHR  noted  that  it  was
       "frequently necessary to give" asylum seekers the  "benefit  of  the
       doubt" when it comes to  assessing  credibility  of  statements  and
       documents; but that when there were "strong reasons to question  the
       veracity of an asylum  seeker's  submissions,  the  individual  must
       provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies".

   29. Beginning at paragraph 52, the ECtHR began  its  own  assessment  of
       RC's credibility.  It noted that one of the Migration  Court  judges
       had considered the applicant to have given  a  credible  account  of
       events.  The ECtHR found that a medical certificate put  before  the
       Migration Board gave a "rather strong indication to the  authorities
       that the applicant's scars and injuries may have been caused by ill-
       treatment or torture" and that, in the circumstances, it was for the
       Board "to dispel any doubts that might  have  persisted  as  to  the
       cause of such scarring".  The ECtHR held that the Board should  have
       "directed that an expert opinion be  obtained  as  to  the  probable
       cause of the applicant's scars".

   30. The court came to the conclusion that  the  applicant  had  given  a
       credible account and was at real risk if returned to Iran.

   31. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Fura said he was not  convinced  that
       the applicant had made out a prima facie case, even having regard to
       the  medical  certificate.   Judge  Fura  did  not  agree  that  the
       certificate meant the authorities should  have  directed  an  expert
       opinion to be obtained.  On the contrary, Judge Fura said he  "would
       be reluctant to give  any  specific  instructions  to  the  domestic
       authorities as to what procedural measure  to  take  and  even  less
       willing to advise on what conclusions to draw from certain  evidence
       introduced in a case where I have not had the benefit of seeing  the
       parties and in which the relevant events  took  place  a  long  time
       ago".

   32. In FG v Sweden (Application no. 43611/11), a judgment of  the  Grand
       Chamber given on 23 March 2016, the ECtHR had this  to  say  on  the
       burden of proof:-

         "120.    Regarding the burden of proof, the Court found in Saadi v.
             Italy (cited above, �� 129-32; see also, among others, Ouabour
             v. Belgium, no. 26417/10, � 65, 2 June 2015  and  Othman  (Abu
             Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, � 261,  ECHR  2012
             (extracts)), that it was in principle  for  the  applicant  to
             adduce evidence capable of proving that there were substantial
             grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of  were
             to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being
             subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3; and  that  where
             such evidence was adduced, it was for the Government to dispel
             any doubts raised by it (ibid., � 129). In order to  determine
             whether there is a  risk  of  ill-treatment,  the  Court  must
             examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the  applicant
             to the  destination  country,  bearing  in  mind  the  general
             situation there and his personal circumstances (ibid., � 130).
              Where the sources available describe a general situation,  an
             applicant's specific allegations in a particular case  require
             corroboration by other evidence  (ibid.,  �  131).   In  cases
             where an applicant alleges that he or she is  a  member  of  a
             group systematically exposed to a practice  of  ill-treatment,
             the Court considers that the protection of Article  3  of  the
             Convention enters into play when  the  applicant  establishes,
             where necessary on the basis of the  above-mentioned  sources,
             that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence  of
             the practice in question and in his or her membership  of  the
             group concerned (ibid., � 132)."

   33.  Applying  this  approach  to  the  facts  of  FG,  who  had  sought
       international  protection  in  Sweden  alleging  a   fear   of   the
       authorities in Iran (both as regards  alleged  political  activities
       and because of a sur place conversion to  Christianity),  the  ECtHR
       held that the Swedish authorities had not erred in  their  approach.
       FG's application was, accordingly, dismissed.

   34. In MA v Switzerland (Application no.  52589/13),  a  second  section
       judgment handed down on 18 November 2014, the ECtHR placed  emphasis
       on the fact  that  neither  the  Migration  Board  nor  the  Federal
       Administrative Court of Switzerland had challenged the  authenticity
       of a court summons, originating  in  Iran,  put  forward  by  MA  in
       connection with his protection claim.  Having carried  out  its  own
       analysis,  the  ECtHR  concluded  that  the  applicant  had  adduced
       evidence capable of proving that there were substantial grounds  for
       believing that, if expelled, he would be at real risk of  Article  3
       ill-treatment and that he "must be given the benefit  of  the  doubt
       with regard to the remaining uncertainties.  The government  on  the
       other hand have not dispelled any doubts that  the  applicant  would
       face such treatment" (paragraph 69).

   35. Judge Kj�lbro gave a dissenting opinion.  He said that an assessment
       of the credibility of a claimant's  account  "is  an  essential  and
       important element in the processing of asylum cases.   This  is,  in
       many cases, a difficult exercise in which many factors  have  to  be
       taken into account" (paragraph 2).

   36. At paragraph 4, Judge Kj�lbro said:

           "Owing to the risk of abuse of the asylum system and  fabricated
           stories from asylum seekers, who have  often  been  assisted  by
           professional  human  traffickers  deriving   profit   from   the
           desperate situation of vulnerable individuals, it is  legitimate
           for asylum authorities to submit the  account  given  by  asylum
           seekers to  a  thorough  examination  in  order  to  assess  the
           credibility of their statements.  In doing so it  is  important,
           amongst other things, to ascertain whether the account given  by
           the asylum seeker, in particular concerning the core elements of
           the motives for seeking asylum, is consistent and coherent."

   37. Judge Kj�lbro noted that the Migration Board had had the benefit  of
       seeing the applicant in person "which is  an  important  element  in
       assessing the reliability of an asylum seeker's motives"  (paragraph
       5).  The authorities in Switzerland considered  that  the  applicant
       had not  given  a  plausible  explanation  for  inconsistencies  and
       discrepancies.  Judge Kj�lbro considered that  the  majority  judges
       were "acting as  a  "fourth  instance"  in  its  assessment  of  the
       reliability of the applicant's statements" (paragraph 6).

   38. He also found that the  importance  attached  to  documents  by  the
       majority was problematic" in that :-

           "It is well-known in asylum cases that it is often easy  to  get
           hold of forged and fraudulently obtained official documents  ...
           If the account given by an asylum seeker is credible,  documents
           in support of the statement are often of  less  importance.   On
           the other hand, if the account given  by  an  asylum  seeker  is
           clearly unreliable, documents will frequently  be  incapable  of
           dispelling the doubts concerning its credibility." (paragraph 7)

   39. Judge Kj�lbro concluded by saying that, in his view,  having  regard
       to the "subsidiary role of the court", the majority had not given  a
       "sufficient basis for overturning the  assessment  of  the  domestic
       authorities as regards the credibility  of  the  applicant's  asylum
       story".

   40. In Paposhvili v Belgium (Application  no.  41738/10),  given  on  13
       December 2016, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR examined the threshold
       in an Article 3 case, involving a claim by a person that  to  remove
       him from Belgium would lead to a real risk  of  serious  harm  as  a
       result of a deterioration  in  his  medical  condition,  where  that
       condition could not be said to be attributable to the authorities of
       the country to which he was proposed to be returned.

   41. We are not here concerned with that aspect of the judgment.  Rather,
       Mr Bedford draws attention to paragraphs 186 and 187, which  contain
       what, by now, can be seen to be standard  statements  of  the  ECtHR
       regarding the burden of proof:-

         "186.    In  the  context  of  these  procedures,  it  is  for  the
             applicants to adduce evidence capable  of  demonstrating  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented,  they  would  be
             exposed to  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above, � 129, and F.G.
             v. Sweden, cited above, � 120).  In this connection it  should
             be observed that a certain degree of speculation  is  inherent
             in the preventive purpose of Article 3 and that it  is  not  a
             matter of requiring the persons  concerned  to  provide  clear
             proof of their claim that they would be exposed to  proscribed
             treatment  (see,  in  particular,  Trabelsi  v.  Belgium,  no.
             140/10, � 130, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).

         187.     Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the  authorities
             of the returning State, in the context of domestic procedures,
             to dispel any doubts raised by it (see Saadi, cited  above,  �
             129, and F.G. v.  Sweden,  cited  above,  �  120).   The  risk
             alleged must be subjected to close scrutiny (see Saadi,  cited
             above, � 128; Sufi  and  Elmi  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  nos.
             8319/07 and 11449/07, � 214, 28 June  2011;  Hirsi  Jamaa  and
             Others, cited above, � 116; and Tarakhel, cited above, �  104)
             in the course of which the authorities in the returning  State
             must consider the foreseeable consequences of removal for  the
             individual concerned in the receiving State, in the  light  of
             the general situation  there  and  the  individual's  personal
             circumstances (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, �  108;
             El-Masri, cited above, � 213; and  Tarakhel,  cited  above,  �
             105).  The assessment  of  the  risk  as  defined  above  (see
             paragraphs 183-84)  must  therefore  take  into  consideration
             general  sources  such  as  reports  of   the   World   Health
             Organisation or of  reputable  non-governmental  organisations
             and  the  medical  certificates  concerning  the   person   in
             question."

   42. We have already observed that, in paragraph 16 of the  judgments  in
       AM (Zimbabwe), Sales LJ stated that the overall legal burden  is  on
       an applicant for international protection relying upon Article 3  to
       show that there are substantial grounds for  believing  that  person
       would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment  contrary  to
       that Article, in the event of  removal.   Sales  LJ  then  said  the
       following:-

           "In Paposhvili, at paras. [186] - [187] ... the Grand Chamber of
           the ECtHR has given guidance how he may achieve that, by raising
           a prima facie case of infringement of Article 3 which then  cast
           an evidential burden onto the defending state which  is  seeking
           to expel him."

    Discussion

   43. It is trite law that the obligation of courts and tribunals  in  the
       United Kingdom is to "take into account any ... judgment,  decision,
       declaration or advisory opinion  of  the  European  Court  of  Human
       Rights ..." (section 2(1)(a)) of the Human Rights Act 1998).  United
       Kingdom courts and tribunals should, however, generally  follow  any
       clear and consistent approach of the ECtHR (particularly, of course,
       its Grand Chamber).  However, that will not be the position  if  and
       in so far as the domestic court or tribunal in question is bound  by
       the principle of stare decisis to follow the decision  of  a  higher
       court  or  tribunal,  even  though  this  may  be  contrary  to  the
       Strasbourg approach: Kay v London Borough of Lambert [2006] UKHL 10.

   44. It is quite clear from RC v Sweden (paragraph 50) and  FG  v  Sweden
       (paragraph 120) that JK v Sweden introduces no new approach  to  the
       issue of the burden of proof in Article 3 cases.  The requirement of
       a government to dispel doubts, where an applicant  adduces  evidence
       "capable  of  proving"  that  there  are  substantial  grounds   for
       believing expulsion would violate Article 3, has been a  feature  of
       the ECtHR jurisprudence for some considerable time.

   45. Whilst that means, of course, that Strasbourg has indeed  maintained
       a consistent approach over a significant period of time, Mr  Bedford
       must face the question of why, if his interpretation of the  ECtHR's
       approach is correct, the startling consequences for  United  Kingdom
       immigration law and, no doubt, much of the law of  other  EU  States
       have not been identified before now.

   46. The fact of the matter is, we find, that there is  no  justification
       for Mr Bedford's contention that evidence  "capable  of  proving"  a
       claim  constitutes  the  same  or  even  a  similar  threshold   for
       determining whether a claim is so lacking  in  substance  as  to  be
       clearly unfounded within the terms of section 94 of the 2002 Act.

   47.  In JK, the ECtHR  cited  (without  evident  disapproval)  both  the
       passages from the UNHCR guidance on the benefit of the doubt,  which
       we  have  set  out  above,  and  also  certain  provisions  of   the
       Qualification Directive  including,  importantly,  Article  4.   The
       UNHCR Note does not say the burden always shifts to  the  government
       in question except where the claim is, on any  view,  hopeless.   We
       shall have more to say on Article 4 of the  Qualification  Directive
       in a moment; but, for the present, we observe that Article  4.5,  on
       its face,  shares  nothing  in  common  with  Mr  Bedford's  primary
       submission.

   48. Accordingly, if Mr  Bedford's  primary  or  "hard"  submission  were
       right, we would expect to see the majority of the  ECtHR  explaining
       why they had seen fit to depart from both the UNHCR Note and Article
       4 of the Qualification Directive.  However, one looks  in  vain  for
       any such explanation.

   49.  It  is  manifest  from  the  ECtHR's  analysis  of   the   personal
       circumstances of the applicants in JK,  which  begins  at  paragraph
       112, that the applicants had,  according  to  the  majority  of  the
       court, produced strong  or  compelling  evidence  of  real  risk  on
       return.  In particular, emphasis was placed by the majority upon the
       findings of the Migration Agency that JK's family had  been  exposed
       to "the most serious forms of  abuses"  by  Al-Qaeda  and  that  the
       latter's  threats  had  continued  after  2008.   Furthermore,  JK's
       account was "consistent with relevant Country of Origin  information
       available from reliable and objective sources" (paragraph 114).

   50. It was on this basis that the majority of the  court  concluded,  at
       paragraph 115, that it was for the Swedish Government to dispel  any
       doubts about the risk  to  the  applicants.   Even  so,  however,  a
       violation of Article 3 was found by only ten votes to seven.

   51. RC v  Sweden  was  not  a  Grand  Chamber  case.   In  reaching  its
       conclusion on credibility, the majority of the ECtHR  was  impressed
       by a medical report, which said that RC had been tortured.

   52. When national courts and tribunals are considering  cases  in  which
       the ECtHR decides to embark on its own fact-finding exercise, it  is
       important to ensure that the ECtHR's  factual  conclusions  are  not
       treated as general principles of human rights law and practice.

   53. Indeed, judicial conclusions of fact will often have little light to
       shed on those  general  principles,  for  the  simple  reason  that,
       whatever standard of proof is in play,  it  is  quite  possible  for
       different judges to reach different but  valid  conclusions  on  the
       same  evidence.  We  see  this  graphically  demonstrated   in   the
       dissenting judgments recorded above.

   54.  In RC, Judge Fura gave a strong dissenting opinion,  in  which  she
       disagreed with the  significance  placed  by  the  majority  on  the
       medical report.   In  MA  v  Switzerland,  Judge  Kj�lbro  explained
       cogently why he took issue with the  significance  afforded  by  the
       majority to the court summons from Iran.

   55. We are, of course, well aware of the status  of  minority  opinions.
       They  nevertheless  reinforce  the  point  that  different   judges,
       properly applying a particular standard of proof,  can  legitimately
       reach different conclusions on the evidence.

   56. It is, therefore, not possible to  find  support  for  Mr  Bedford's
       primary submission from the ways  in  which,  in  these  cases,  the
       members of the ECtHR have gone about their fact-finding  tasks.   In
       particular, there is nothing in the cases to suggest that the  court
       regards the threshold of "evidence capable of proving ..." as a  low
       one, let alone so low as to catch only cases that are bound to fail,
       on any rational view.

   57. We turn to the "softer" version of Mr Bedford's  submissions.   This
       involves an analysis of Article 4.5 of the Qualification  Directive.



   58. The first point to mention is one  which  we  have  already  touched
       upon; namely, that Article 4.5 is, on its face, wholly  inconsistent
       with Mr Bedford's "strong" version.  Mr  Bedford,  however,  submits
       that the effect of Article 4.5 is as follows.

   59. The provision applies only in cases where an  applicant's  statement
       is not "supported by documentary or other  evidence".   Article  4.5
       explains the circumstances in which the  absence  of  such  evidence
       can, in effect, be set to one side and the applicant's  claim  still
       accepted as satisfying the burden and  standard  of  proof.   Where,
       however, an applicant does have such documentary or other  evidence,
       in addition to his or her own statement, Mr Bedford submits that the
       corollary of Article 4.5 is the applicant  is  thereby  entitled  to
       succeed.

   60. We do not accept this interpretation.  Article  4.5  means  what  it
       says.  A person who, in respect of each  of  sub-paragraphs  (a)  to
       (e), has put forward a cogent claim should not fail, merely  because
       he or she does not have supporting documentation.   Nowhere  in  the
       Qualification Directive is there to be found any  statement  to  the
       effect that a person who has documentation which, on its  face,  may
       be said to be supportive  of  the  claim  (for  example,  an  arrest
       warrant or  witness  summons),  but  whose  claim  is  found  to  be
       problematic in other respects, has nevertheless made out their case,
       so that the burden of disproving it shifts to the government.

   61. Although it was not cited before us, we observe that in KS  (Benefit
       of the Doubt) [2014] UKUT 00552 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held  that
       "the  ambit  of  Article  4(5)  is  limited   to   cases   of   non-
       corroboration/confirmation"  (paragraph  85).  We  agree  with  that
       finding.

   62.  Nothing we have said is intended  to  diminish  the  importance  of
       Article  4.5  in  the  circumstances  in  which  it  applies.  Those
       circumstances must, however, be kept in mind.  Article  4.5  has  no
       application outside them.

   63. In  Tanveer  Ahmed  [2002]  UKIAT*  00439,  the  Immigration  Appeal
       Tribunal in a "starred" decision, held that it  is  unnecessary  for
       the respondent to allege that a document relied on by an  individual
       is a forgery, in order to resist the submission  that  the  document
       must be given weight by the Tribunal.  Accordingly, as  set  out  in
       summary in paragraph 38 of the IAT's determination: "It  is  for  an
       individual claimant to show that a document on  which  he  seeks  to
       rely can be relied on".

   64. There is nothing in the Strasbourg case  law  or  the  Qualification
       Directive to call that statement into doubt.   What  the  Strasbourg
       case law does demonstrate is that, where a judicial  fact-finder  is
       satisfied that a document adduced by an  applicant  in  evidence  is
       reliable, then this may mean that the government in question will be
       required to show why the applicant is,  nevertheless,  not  at  real
       risk.   Depending  on  the  circumstances,  that  may  require   the
       government  to  make  its  own  enquiries  regarding  the  document.
       However, as can  be  seen  from  the  dissenting  judgments  in  the
       Strasbourg cases, there is, emphatically, no "bright line" rule that
       governs judicial fact-finding in this area.

   65. For the above reasons, the  burden  and  standard  of  proof  to  be
       applied in this case are as we have summarised at [7] above.

      EVIDENCE

   66. We had before us a consolidated bundle of documents  containing  the
       following:
       (a)  Three witness statements from the Appellant dated  25  November
       2014, one undated (and unsigned) entitled "Rebuttal Statement" and a
       supplementary statement dated 4 January 2018;
       (b)  Letters in support of the Appellant from his social worker  and
       foster carer;
       (c)  Various  documents  relating  to  the  Appellant's  educational
       achievements in the UK;
       (d)  Background material concerning the situation in  Egypt  ([B/55-
       236]).


   67. Mr Bedford indicated that he would not be calling the  Appellant  to
       give oral evidence.   We received submissions from both parties.  We
       refer to the evidence and submissions so  far  as  relevant  to  our
       decision.  We have had regard to all the  submissions  and  evidence
       when reaching our decision.

    THE APPELLANT'S PROTECTION CLAIM: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS


   68. We begin with the  Appellant's  age.   The  Appellant  is  now  aged
       seventeen and a half years.  As we note above, Mr  Bedford  did  not
       call the Appellant to give oral  evidence.   As  we  understood  his
       reasons those are unconnected with the Appellant's age or ability to
       give evidence.


   69. However, it is important that we keep in mind the Appellant's age at
       the time of the events which he claims occurred and at the  time  of
       his interviews since at all material times, he was a child and quite
       a young child.  His age may account for  discrepancies  between  the
       accounts he has given at various times  and  may  also  explain  any
       failure to provide detail when first asked about his claim.

    Individual Protection Claim: Land Dispute


   70. Taking first, the Appellant's claim to be  at  individual  risk,  he
       says that this is on account of a feud with another  family  at  the
       heart of which is land which he  inherited  from  his  father.   The
       Appellant says that his parents passed away when he was aged  twelve
       years.  He says that he and his two sisters then moved in  with  his
       uncle.


   71. As Mr Bedford submitted, once the Appellant had  admitted  his  true
       nationality and identity, he has since  been  consistent  about  the
       core of his claim to be at risk on account of this land dispute.

   72. A number of discrepancies were identified  by  the  Respondent.   Mr
       Bedford pointed out that the Respondent had failed to  take  account
       of the Appellant's age when he made the claim, that he was in foster
       care, learning a foreign language  and  recalling  events  from  two
       years previously.

   73. Mr Najib set out at some length the reasons why the Respondent  says
       that the Appellant's claim should be disbelieved. We set  out  below
       those  submissions  and  (where  appropriate)  we  record  also  the
       Appellant's written evidence in answer to those submissions. We have
       also set out our findings in relation to each aspect relied upon.

   74. The Appellant provided a wholly false account  at  screening  stage.
       He said he was Syrian.  That claim indicated a degree of planning to
       make a false claim. The Appellant has not explained why he  did  not
       claim asylum in Italy and France and  has  also  given  inconsistent
       accounts of how he left Egypt.  In one account, he says that he just
       followed others in his group.  In another, he says he  was  told  by
       the group to say he was from Syria and they gave him the information
       in order to make that claim.  He then says that  it  was  a  man  in
       France who gave him the details about Syria.  He now says  that  his
       uncle told him to come to the UK and to claim to be from Syria.

   75. The Appellant points out that, as a child, he did not know  anything
       about asylum or the procedures  for  claiming.   He  says  that  the
       authorities in  Italy  and  France  did  not  inform  him  of  those
       procedures and he just followed others who were coming  to  the  UK.
       He now regrets claiming to be from Syria but says that he was simply
       doing as he was advised to do.


   76. Although we note the inconsistencies between the accounts  given  by
       the Appellant as to who told him to claim  what,  we  do  not  place
       weight on those.  As a child, it is perhaps understandable  that  he
       would follow instructions he was given as to  what  to  do  when  he
       arrived, whoever gave those instructions.  It is also understandable
       that he would not wish to say who told him to lie.

   77. The Appellant claims  that  both  his  parents  have  died  but  has
       provided no evidence that this is the case.  He remained in  contact
       with his uncle he says until February 2016 and could therefore  have
       provided some evidence.  A similar point is made about the  lack  of
       documentation regarding the ownership of land.

   78. The Appellant has been legally  represented,  it  appears,  from  an
       early stage.  The firm which currently represents him were on record
       for him at the time of his asylum interview and the  Appellant  said
       (in the interview record) that his solicitor helped him to  complete
       the SEF.  An experienced practitioner would recognise the  advantage
       to be gained from substantiating  the  claim  so  far  as  possible.
       However, there is nothing to suggest that the Appellant was asked to
       provide such additional evidence and, as a child, he  could  not  be
       expected to know that he should do so.


   79. The Appellant has changed his  account  about  the  reasons  why  he
       ceased education.  First,  he  said  that  this  was  for  financial
       reasons.  Then he said it was because of the risk to  him  from  the
       family involved in the feud.  Then he concluded that  it  must  have
       been because of that risk.  As a child,  it  is  plausible  that  he
       would not have known why he was taken out of school.  He says in his
       statement that he now thinks there were two reasons but it  may  not
       have occurred to him at the time that it was the risk which was  the
       main reason ; indeed, at the time when he was taken out of school he
       claims not to have known about that risk.

   80. However, at the same time as asserting that he  was  prevented  from
       going to school because of the risk, the Appellant also says that he
       was not prevented from going out  in  the  immediate  neighbourhood.
       That is in spite of claiming that the other family  is  so  powerful
       that they would be able to trace him in Cairo. We do not  accept  as
       plausible that the Appellant's uncle would allow him to  go  out  in
       the local area if he was being kept out of  school  because  of  the
       risk.  Whilst the reason is a matter for the Appellant's uncle,  the
       Appellant has not changed his evidence that he was allowed to go out
       within the neighbourhood whilst being told he could not go to school
       or the land ([10] of the  Rebuttal  Statement).  It  is  implausible
       that, if the Appellant was taken out of school because of the  feud,
       his uncle would not have also prevented him from going  out  in  the
       immediate area.


   81. There is an inconsistency between the Appellant claiming  to  be  at
       risk and the lack of risk to the other family members.  He does  not
       say that the other family threatened his father.   Nor  is  it  said
       that the other family targeted his mother after his father's  death.
       The Appellant says that his mother died six months after his father.
       Although the Appellant says that  his  sisters  inherited  a  lesser
       share of the land, they were still beneficiaries but it is not  said
       that his sisters were threatened.


   82. We note the Appellant's explanation for this.   He  says  his  uncle
       told him that only males would be threatened.  We were not taken  to
       any background material to show that this is the way in  which  land
       feuds are conducted in Egypt. We note also that  the  Appellant  was
       able to remain in Egypt for some time after his father's  death  (he
       says his father dies when he was aged twelve and therefore in  2013;
       he did not leave Egypt until 2014).

   83. If there were a genuine land dispute, the other  family  would  have
       targeted  the  Appellant's  father  before  him,  would  have  taken
       advantage of the Appellant's father's death  to  target  his  mother
       before her death or would have made threats to the Appellant's uncle
       since he was looking after the Appellant and his siblings who  owned
       the land thereafter and/or targeted the  Appellant  himself  in  the
       period before he left Egypt.

   84. There is an inconsistency in the Appellant's evidence about how  the
       land was used.  The Appellant says that  his  father  farmed  it  to
       provide food for the family. The impression given is that it  was  a
       small plot used only for that purpose. However, that is said by  the
       Respondent to be inconsistent with the interest shown in it  by  the
       other family.  We place little weight on that inconsistency.   There
       is likely to be a cultural  difference  between  the  way  in  which
       people regard agricultural land in rural Egypt and what might be the
       position in the UK.  What might appear to be only land suitable  for
       subsistence farming might  still  be  viewed  as  valuable  in  that
       environment.

   85. The Appellant says that the family did not use the  land  after  his
       father died but at the same time says that he became  aware  of  the
       risk because the crops were burned.  In his Rebuttal Statement,  the
       Appellant says that his evidence about this has  been  misunderstood
       ([3]).  He says that "we" had  started  to  use  the  land  to  grow
       produce "before the problem had started" but were unable  to  do  so
       thereafter because the other family burnt the land.  That is  though
       inconsistent with his evidence  that  he  did  not  know  about  the
       threats  until  his  uncle  told  him  about  them.   We  note   the
       inconsistency asserted by the Respondent about when his  uncle  told
       him about the feud (one week before he left or two to  three  weeks)
       but that is not a significant difference and we do not take it  into
       account.

   86. It is though not plausible that the Appellant would not  have  known
       of the risk earlier if the other family was attacking the  land;  at
       the very least, it would have prompted him to ask his uncle why this
       was happening.  It is also implausible, as we  have  already  noted,
       that, if the other family were genuinely  interested  in  the  land,
       they would not have taken it earlier, either  when  the  Appellant's
       father was alive or immediately after his death.


   87. The Respondent points to a further inconsistency  arising  from  the
       burning of the crops because the Appellant says he  did  not  report
       that because the other family were politically influential but  then
       says that he did not know who had burned the crops. He says  in  his
       first statement that he does not know  whether  his  uncle  reported
       this to the authorities ([9]).  We accept that, as the Appellant was
       a child, it would be more likely that the  Appellant's  uncle  would
       report the problem.  There is no evidence one way or another whether
       he did so.

   88. However, we regard as embellishment what the Appellant says  in  his
       witness statement about the identity and reach of the other  family.



   89. We begin with what the Appellant says about  that  family.   In  his
       first witness statement, he said that he does not know who they are.
        He says he only knew what his uncle told him and he  had  not  told
       the Appellant who wanted to harm him.  At interview,  at  first,  he
       said that he did not know who they were or if  they  were  powerful.
       He said his uncle told him only that it was  a  large  family.   The
       Appellant has now said that they are  a  very  famous  and  powerful
       family who would be able to track him down in Cairo, that  they  may
       have been responsible for the killing of  government  officials  and
       are linked with the drugs trade ([15] of the Rebuttal Statement).

   90. In the Rebuttal Statement, the Appellant  says  that  he  could  not
       remember the name until it came to his mind  at  interview.   Before
       that, he says he had forgotten.  He says that "it just  happened  to
       be that I was able to recall the name of the family  that  my  uncle
       had told me  about."  Mr  Becket  said  that  the  inconsistency  at
       interview arose because the Appellant thought he was being asked for
       the family's first names.  In  order  to  consider  the  Appellant's
       explanation, it is necessary to look at the questioning relating  to
       this topic at interview as follows:


            "[Q97]     Did he [the uncle] say who these people were?
                 [A]   No
                 [Q98] Did you ask him?
                 [A]   I did. He said I don't know them.
            ...
                 [Q127]      Who do you fear?
            [A]  I don't know them.
            ...
            [Q138]     Are the people who want the land powerful?
            [A]  I don't know.
            [Q139]     What makes you think they have power or influence to
           find you in Cairo or Alexandria?
            [A]  My uncle told me they are a big family.
            [Q140]     So it is a family who want your land - correct?
            [A]  I don't know. They want to take land. Full stop.
            [Q141]     You said they were a big family?
            [A]  I don't know how they would take it. They are big families
           and taken anything they want.
            [Q142]     How do you know they are [?] families?
            [A]  They are well known but you don't know which of them.
            [Q143]     Name of the family?
            [A]  ZUKUM
            ...
            [Q149]     In your witness statement you said you did not  know
           who the people were.  Today  you  say  they  are  a  well  known
           political family. Why not mention this before?
            [A]  All I know they are well known people.  I don't know  what
           they do for a living.
            [Q150]     But why not mention their name on witness statement?
            [A]  I don't know them, their names. I didn't see them before.
            [Q151]     How did you learn they were called Zukum?
            [A]  If I say this family well known.  I don't know names.
            [Q152]     How know named Zukum?
            [A]  If I know names I would have told you.
            [Q153]     You said they were called Zukum?
            [A]  I know they are from Zukum family but I don't know names.
            [Q154]     How know this?
                 [A]   My uncle told me. This is small family. This  is  big
family.
                 [Q155]      You didn't mention this when I asked  you  what
uncle said?
            [A]  He told me a long time ago."


       Although we accept that the  latter  part  of  this  exchange  might
       suggest that the Appellant thought he was being asked  for  specific
       names (as Mr Becket suggested), as Mr Najib pointed out,  that  does
       not explain why in the earlier part of the  exchange  the  Appellant
       did not volunteer the name of the family but  later  gave  it.   Nor
       does it explain why he said that his uncle had not told him the name
       of the people threatening him (which is consistent with what he said
       in his first statement).


   91. As a child, as Mr Najib pointed out, it might be expected  that  the
       Appellant would be able to give more  detail  at  an  earlier  stage
       (while memories are fresher) rather than  less.   Whilst  we  accept
       that the impact of a traumatic journey might impact on  the  ability
       to remember, we find it wholly implausible that a person,  child  or
       not, would in the course of the same  interview  say  that  he  knew
       nothing of those at the source of his problems and then go on to say
       that he knew who they were and that they were influential.  Nor does
       the Appellant explain how he knows what  is  said  at  [15]  of  his
       Rebuttal Statement about the extent of that influence.   We  do  not
       accept the Appellant's evidence on this point.


   92. The Respondent points out that the Appellant could avoid  the  risk,
       if genuine, by selling the land or not using it.  The Appellant says
       that there would be no problem if the land was not used ([5] of  the
       Rebuttal Statement).  However, that assertion is contradicted by the
       fact that the Appellant's father was not targeted when he was  using
       the land to grow crops and also that the Appellant  claims  to  have
       been at risk at a time when the land was, he says, not  being  used.
       When asked why he did not just give up the land to avoid  the  risk,
       the Appellant said that the family needed it as  farmers.   However,
       as  the  Respondent  points  out,  that  is  inconsistent  with  the
       Appellant's case that it was not used and also with the fact that he
       left Egypt to avoid the risk which would mean that  the  land  would
       not be used.  Although, as  the  Appellant  points  out,  he  cannot
       answer for the actions of the other family since he left  Egypt,  it
       is notable that he does not say that the other family has taken  the
       land since he left.

   93. The Appellant also said that he could not sell the land because  his
       sisters were minors at the time.  He does not explain the  relevance
       of that since he too was a minor at that time.  The  Appellant  does
       not give any evidence about any attempts to dispose of the land  nor
       point to  any  background  evidence  suggesting  that  his  and  his
       sisters' ages would make it difficult for them to sell the land.  We
       accept that, as the Appellant was not an adult at the time,  if  the
       land was to be sold, it  would  be  his  uncle  who  would  have  to
       instruct someone to take that course.  However, it is not clear  why
       his uncle would not do so if, as the  Appellant  says,  it  was  not
       possible  to  usefully  farm  the  land  because  of  the   problems
       encountered from the other family and the holding of that  land  was
       causing a risk (on the Appellant's case).


   94.  The  Appellant  says  that  his  uncle  was  not  threatened.   The
       Respondent also says that this is implausible because the  Appellant
       says that his uncle only became aware of the  risk  because  he  was
       told about it by others in the community.   The  Appellant  did  not
       know the identity of these other people.  He does not know how  they
       came to know about the risk.  We recognise that the  Appellant  will
       not himself know how his uncle came to know about the risk, who told
       him etc.  That is something which only the Appellant's  uncle  would
       know unless the Appellant had  asked  him  about  it.   However,  we
       return to the point above that, if there were a genuine risk on this
       account, his uncle  also  would  have  been  targeted  or  at  least
       threatened directly.  If the other family genuinely wanted the  land
       for itself, it is not  plausible  that  they  would  not  have  gone
       directly to the person or people who  could  transfer  the  land  to
       them.

   95. We recognise that the Appellant has been consistent in his claim  to
       have been targeted because of the  land  dispute.   We  also  accept
       that, as a child, the Appellant  might  not  be  aware  of  all  the
       details about the threats and risk to him.  However, for the  reason
       we give above,  his  account  is  implausible  and  inconsistent  in
       certain significant aspects.  Some  of  the  inconsistencies  cannot
       simply be explained away by his age. For the reasons we give  above,
       we do not accept his account as credible.


    General Protection Claim: Risk as  a  Lone  Child  on  Return  to  Home
    Area/Cairo


   96. The Appellant claims that he has lost contact  with  his  family  in
       Egypt, in particular his uncle who cared for him before he  came  to
       the UK.


   97. The Respondent says that his account about how this  came  about  is
       implausible and incapable of belief.


   98. We begin by setting out what the Appellant now says  about  when  he
       lost contact and how.  That is in his supplementary statement  dated
       4 January 2018:


            "[4] I have had no contact with my maternal uncle  since  early
           2016.  I would like to clarify that I left Egypt  with  a  small
           mobile  phone  which  I  lost  in  Italy.   In  Italy  with  the
           assistance of people I managed to purchase another mobile  phone
           where I had my uncle's number stored.   I  would  also  keep  my
           uncle's number recorded on a piece of paper in my pocket.   Upon
           entering the UK after approximately  5  months  unfortunately  I
           lost that mobile too.  But I did manage to contact  my  uncle  a
           few times on this 2nd phone but  soon  after  my  uncle  stopped
           answering my calls.  I do not know why.  I do  not  know  how  I
           lost the 2nd mobile.   I  then  purchased  another  (3rd)  small
           mobile in the UK. I never stored my uncle's number on  this  3rd
           mobile as I was worried that again I may lose this  mobile  too.
           I feared  for  my  uncle's  safety.   I  confirm  that  I  never
           contacted my uncle on this  number.   Thus  there  would  be  no
           reason for his number to appear in the 'call  log  history'.   I
           understand that I have dialled my uncle's number many  times  in
           the past but cannot recall the number.  I always kept his number
           on a piece of paper and left the paper in my  jeans  which  were
           washed.  The paper with the number was torn and the  number  was
           illegible.  I ask the Tribunal to note that I have since lost my
           3rd mobile  and  now  purchased  a  4th  mobile.   I  have  been
           forthcoming about this and not concealed  any  information  from
           the Home Office.  I have not contacted my uncle and worried  for
           his safety.  He could have possibly relocated elsewhere or  even
           be displaced.  His current location is unknown to me.  I do  not
           know how the Home Office expect me to  return  to  Egypt  to  my
           uncle if I do not know where he is."


   99. As Mr Najib pointed out, the Appellant does not say how he was  able
       to get his uncle's number when he got a new phone.  It may  be  that
       the Appellant means that he was able to put the number on the  phone
       from the piece of paper with the number  which  he  claims  to  have
       since lost when his trousers were put in the washing machine.  We do
       not place weight on that as reason not to accept what the  Appellant
       says.


  100. The Appellant says that he has never had his uncle's contact details
       on his third phone.  However, as the Respondent points out, even  if
       the Appellant did not store the number,  if  the  Appellant's  uncle
       contacted him, his number would  show  on  the  call  history.   The
       Appellant does not say  in  his  statement  whether  his  uncle  has
       contacted him since he obtained the third phone.  However,  he  says
       that he lost the second phone about five months from his arrival  in
       the UK.  That would be in about February 2015.  The  Appellant  says
       however in his statement that he lost  contact  with  his  uncle  in
       early 2016.  If that is so, then his uncle must have  contacted  him
       since he obtained the third phone.

  101. The Appellant's assertion that he last contacted his uncle in  early
       2016 may be inconsistent with what he  told  the  age  assessors  in
       March 2015 (that he had not had contact for  some  time).   However,
       that is not necessarily the  position  if  he  had  resumed  contact
       thereafter.  In his substantive asylum interview, in June 2015,  the
       Appellant said that he was in contact with his uncle "once a  month"
       [Q46] and that his uncle contacts him. He said that he did not  have
       the number stored on his then current phone  (presumably  the  third
       phone) because  he  had  forgotten  and  deleted  all  the  numbers.
       However, it does not explain why the number would not have  appeared
       in the call history log.

  102. As Mr Najib  pointed  out,  the  Appellant's  only  family  (on  his
       account) are his uncle and sisters  in  Egypt.   We  agree  with  Mr
       Najib's  submission  that,  in  such  circumstances,  it  is  wholly
       improbable that the Appellant would have carelessly deleted the only
       contact details he held for that family. As Mr Najib submitted,  and
       we accept, it is more likely that the Appellant did so by design  to
       avoid the authorities contacting his uncle.

  103. That does not though take the Respondent home on  his  case  because
       the issue is whether the Appellant has the ability  to  contact  his
       uncle now and, if not, the situation that the Appellant  would  face
       on return to Egypt.

  104. On the issue of fact relating to whether the  Appellant  has  indeed
       lost contact with his uncle, Mr Bedford directed  our  attention  to
       the findings made by the previous Judges.  Dealing first with  Judge
       Graham's initial decision, the Judge does not make findings one  way
       or another.  She finds that  what  the  Appellant  says  about  when
       contact was lost is consistent as between his (first) statement  and
       the evidence from his social worker and that this was in early 2016.
        As we have already noted, that is to some extent undermined by  the
       chronology he now gives about the various phones.  The  Judge  takes
       account of the Appellant's age when dealing with this issue at  [34]
       of the decision but then goes on at [35] to decide it  by  reference
       to what the Respondent had or had not done in relation  to  tracing.
       There is no finding one way or another whether the  Appellant  still
       had contact at that stage although we accept  that  it  is  unlikely
       that the Judge would have determined the appeal as she purported  to
       do if she were satisfied that the Appellant was still in contact  as
       there would be no need for tracing if he was to be returned  to  his
       family in Egypt. The lack of finding on this issue is  moreover  one
       of the reasons why Judge Rimington found it necessary to  remit  the
       appeal.


  105. In relation to Judge Robertson's decision, the finding is set out at
       [25(VIII)] as follows:
           "...I  find,  to  the  lower  standard  of  proof,  that  it  is
           reasonably likely that the Appellant has been and  still  is  in
           contact with his uncle but he does not want to provide a  number
           for him to hamper the Respondent's efforts to  trace  his  uncle
           because he is now aware that it enhances his  chances  of  being
           given leave to remain in the UK...."


  106. We reject the gloss which the Appellant seeks to put on this finding
       as submitted by Mr Bedford that, because the  Judge  has  determined
       the issue only on the lower standard which is less than the  balance
       of probabilities, what the Judge in fact found is that  it  is  more
       likely than not that the Appellant has lost this contact.


  107. It is of course the case that the earlier decisions  have  been  set
       aside and none of the findings are preserved.  Having regard to what
       we say above about the implausibility of the Appellant's account  as
       to his ability to contact his uncle, we find his  evidence  on  this
       aspect not to be credible.  It follows that we do not accept that he
       does not retain that contact (or at least the ability to  make  that
       contact). We therefore find that the Appellant  can  return  to  his
       home area of Egypt (where we have found that he is not at risk)  and
       can return to his family there.

  108. In case we are wrong about that, though, we go on to  make  findings
       about what the position would be if the Appellant cannot be returned
       to his family in Egypt.  The Appellant is still a minor.   As  such,
       although we note that he is only  six  months  from  his  eighteenth
       birthday, he is still in the position of  an  unaccompanied  asylum-
       seeking child.

  109. Mr Najib made the submission that we should decide this issue on the
       basis and assumption that the Appellant  will  not  be  returned  to
       Egypt until after his eighteenth birthday.  We  were  initially  not
       disposed to accept that submission, inconsistent as  it  is  on  the
       obligation on us to decide all issues as at date of hearing.

  110. We have though come to the conclusion that on this  point,  that  is
       not the right approach on this issue.  That arises  because  of  the
       Respondent's guidance entitled Children's Asylum  Claims  (published
       on 9 October 2017).  Our attention was not drawn to this guidance by
       either party but it is a publicly available document which,  as  the
       Respondent's own guidance about  how  asylum  claims  from  children
       should be handled, is clearly relevant to this case.

  111. At page [67] there is a  section  dealing  with  the  obligation  on
       caseworkers to consider reception arrangements.  In the introductory
       section, the guidance states that "[t]he Home Office  has  a  policy
       commitment that no unaccompanied child will be removed from  the  UK
       unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that  safe  and  adequate
       reception arrangements are in place in  the  country  to  which  the
       child is to be removed".

  112. If that unambiguous statement of policy  requires  further  support,
       that is to be found at page [62] where it is stated  that  cases  of
       removal of children aged over 17.5 years (as here) need first to  be
       considered in line with the above  policy  commitment  and  "[w]here
       removal is  not  appropriate,  children  who  are  refused  outright
       because they are over 17.5, but are under 18 years of age,  will  be
       liable for removal on turning 18". In light  of  the  stated  policy
       commitment, the Appellant could challenge any attempt to remove  him
       before his eighteenth birthday in January 2019.

  113. We did not hear full argument about Mr Najib's second point that  we
       should not consider the Appellant's protection claim based  on  this
       risk because he  will  not  in  fact  be  removed  before  he  turns
       eighteen.  Section 82 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
       defines a protection claim as a claim that  removal  "would  breach"
       the Refugee Convention or the Respondent's obligations  in  relation
       to the grant of humanitarian protection.  In circumstances where  we
       did not hear full argument, we have decided that it  is  appropriate
       to determine this issue on the premise of removal as at date of  the
       hearing before us.


  114. In so doing, we accept Mr Najib's submission  that,  simply  because
       there is no contact  between  the  Respondent  and  the  Appellant's
       family and because the Appellant would therefore be returned  alone,
       does not lead to an automatic finding that a protection claim should
       succeed.  We of course accept  Mr  Bedford's  proposition  that  the
       returning of a lone child to his  home  country  can  give  rise  to
       treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR.  However, whether  that  is  a
       real risk  depends on the evidence that such a  risk  exists  for  a
       minor alone returning to Egypt.


  115. We have already determined that there is no risk to the Appellant in
       his home area and that he would be able to resume contact  with  his
       family in that area even if he has not maintained that contact since
       early 2016 as he claims.


  116. Even if the Appellant's family are no longer in that area and he has
       genuinely lost contact with them, it does not follow that  he  could
       not return to that area on his own or remain in Cairo.


  117. Mr Bedford drew our attention to  what  is  said  in  the  US  State
       Department report for Egypt dated 2015 ([B/129]).  Whilst  there  is
       evidence there of abuse and exploitation of children, what is  there
       said has to be read in context.  There is reference to the struggles
       faced by so-called "street children" which applies to  children  who
       are displaced but it is also there said that many of those  children
       are victims of violence and sexual abuse.  It is not suggested  that
       a child, particularly one approaching  adulthood  who  has  had  the
       benefit of education in the UK over the past four years, would  fall
       into that category simply by reason of his age.   Put  another  way,
       the report does not suggest that any child living  alone  in  Egypt,
       particularly one aged nearly eighteen, would be  at  risk  for  that
       reason.


  118. We accept, as  the  Appellant  says  at  [5]  of  his  supplementary
       statement, that he has been looked after by his  foster  mother  and
       social worker whilst he  has  been  in  the  UK  and  has  formed  a
       dependency on them.  He might not find independence easy.   However,
       we do not accept that the limited evidence such as it is gives  rise
       to a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR on return
       to Egypt, whether that be to the Appellant's home area or to  Cairo.
       The evidence is simply insufficient to establish  the  risk  to  the
       high threshold which applies.


    THE APPELLANT'S ARTICLE 8 ECHR CLAIM: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS


  119. Although  there  is  no  mention  of  an  Article  8  claim  in  the
       Appellant's statement of case for the hearing before us, we did  not
       understand the Appellant to have abandoned  his  previous  case  and
       there is nothing in Judge O'Connor's decision  which  suggests  that
       the findings of Judge  Robertson  dismissing  the  Article  8  human
       rights claim were to be maintained.  For completeness, therefore  we
       turn to deal with that claim.


  120. We begin with the Appellant's best interests as a child.  Whilst  on
       the one hand, he may well benefit, as he  has  done  to  date,  from
       remaining in the UK, on the other, his family are in Egypt and it is
       in his best interests as a child to have contact with and live in  a
       family unit.  His best interests are probably to remain  in  the  UK
       but only marginally so.


  121. Even accepting that the Appellant's best interests are to remain  in
       the UK, though, that is not the end of  the  Article  8  assessment.
       Much has been made in the appeal to date of the Respondent's  policy
       in  relation  to  unaccompanied  asylum-seeking  children  and   the
       assessment that such children should be given discretionary leave to
       remain until they are aged seventeen and a half.   However,  we  are
       not concerned with what the Respondent should have done in the  past
       but what the position is at the date of the hearing before  us.   At
       that date, the Appellant was only about one month  from  being  aged
       seventeen and a half.


  122. We do not accept that the Respondent's policy requires her to  grant
       discretionary leave as at the date of the hearing for  that  reason.
       We have regard to the Respondent's guidance cited at [110] above and
       to paragraph 352ZC(a) of the Immigration Rules which provides that a
       child should be granted  discretionary  leave  as  an  unaccompanied
       asylum-seeking child only where he/she would be  under  the  age  of
       seventeen and a half throughout the duration of the grant of  leave.
       That does not apply to this Appellant.


  123. We note what is said  in  the  Appellant's  supplementary  statement
       about his relationship with his foster mother and social worker.  We
       have read their evidence which speaks of  his  "fantastic  progress"
       particularly his educational achievements.  We accept that  he  will
       have formed a relationship with his foster carers akin  to  that  of
       parents and child.  He has lived with them since September 2014  and
       therefore for nearly four years.  We note what  is  said  about  the
       Appellant's immersion in British culture.


  124. However, the fact remains that  the  Appellant  has  his  biological
       family members living in Egypt.   For the purposes of this decision,
       we accept that he has lost his parents at a young age but he has  an
       uncle who raised him thereafter for a year or  so  and  he  has  two
       sisters with whom he grew up.  We accept  that  the  Appellant  will
       find it difficult to leave behind his foster parents but we  do  not
       accept that the interference with that relationship formed over only
       about four years is sufficient to outweigh the  public  interest  in
       immigration control in circumstances  where  the  Appellant  has  no
       other basis of stay in the UK.


  125. Turning to his private life, the Appellant has been in  the  UK  for
       nearly four years.  He is now aged seventeen and was  aged  thirteen
       on arrival.  However, that is an  insufficient  period  for  him  to
       succeed under paragraph 276ADE of the Rules.


  126. We have considered whether it can  be  said  that  there  are  "very
       significant obstacles" to his integration in Egypt for the  purposes
       of paragraph  276ADE.   We  do  not  accept  that  there  are.   The
       Appellant speaks the language and is used to the customs  in  Egypt.
       It may be that he has become accustomed to the culture here also but
       we do not accept that he would have lost his association with  Egypt
       where he spent a much larger part of his  formative  years.   As  we
       note, he also still has family in Egypt.


  127. That the Appellant cannot meet the Rules in relation to his  private
       and family life is relevant also to our assessment of  the  position
       outside the Rules.  We have already explained why we do not consider
       that the interference with his family life is sufficient to outweigh
       the public interest.

  128. We do not accept either that the interference with his private  life
       outweighs the public interest for the reasons which follow.


  129. We accept that removal will cause some disruption to the Appellant's
       private life.  In  particular,  we  note  what  is  said  about  his
       educational achievements and plans for a future career.   There  may
       be some disruption to his desire to become a tradesman. Although  no
       doubt such  trades  are  still  required  in  Egypt,  there  may  be
       differences in the training available for those trades.   We  accept
       also that it may take the Appellant some time  to  readjust  to  the
       cultural differences between Egypt and the UK.   The  Appellant  has
       not been in the UK for a lengthy period but, for a child, four years
       is still a long while.  According to the evidence,  though,  he  has
       adjusted well to the cultural differences in the UK (having  started
       from a point of knowing no English or  anything  about  the  culture
       here).  He can therefore be expected to be able to  adjust  back  to
       the culture with which he is familiar from his early years, with the
       assistance of his family in Egypt.


  130. As we have already noted, the Appellant has no basis of stay in  the
       UK. Having regard to Section 117B of the 2002 Act,  the  maintenance
       of  effective  immigration  control  is  therefore  in  the   public
       interest.  The Appellant's private life has been formed  at  a  time
       when his status here has been precarious.  It  is  therefore  to  be
       accorded little weight.


  131. Balancing all the factors to  which  we  have  had  regard,  we  are
       satisfied  that  the  decision  to  remove  the  Appellant  is   not
       disproportionate.  The decision is therefore not unlawful  as  being
       contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998.



            DECISION
      The Appellant's appeal is dismissed on  protection  and  human  rights
grounds.
