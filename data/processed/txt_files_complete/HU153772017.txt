For the appellant:     Ms Brakaj, on behalf of the appellant
For the respondent:    Ms Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. On 14 October 2017 the respondent made an order that the appellant is
       to be deported from the United Kingdom ('UK'), following her criminal
       convictions as it was considered that her presence in the UK was  not
       conducive to the public good. The respondent refused the  appellant's
       human rights claim in a decision letter dated 20th September 2017.

    2. The appellant, a citizen of Jamaica, appealed this  decision  to  the
       First-tier Tribunal (Judge Holmes) ('FtTJ').  In a decision  sent  on
       24th July 2019, the FtTJ allowed her appeal on human rights  grounds,
       and the Secretary of State has now appealed, with permission, to  the
       Upper Tribunal.

    3. Whilst this is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State,  for  ease  of
       reference I intend to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal.

The decision of the FtTJ:

    4. The appellant's background in set out in detailed chronological order
       in the FTtJ's very detailed and carefully drafted decision.  The FtTJ
       made comprehensive findings of fact having considered in  detail  the
       appellant's history and her medical circumstances  and  her  criminal
       offending in accordance with the documentation that  was  before  the
       Tribunal.

    5. The grounds advanced on behalf of  the  respondent  do  not  seek  to
       challenge the factual history of the appellant but seek to  challenge
       the conclusions reached by the FtTJ that there were "very significant
       obstacles to  her  re-integration"  to  Jamaica  or  his  alternative
       finding  that  "very  compelling  circumstances"  existed   for   the
       appellant.

    6. I shall therefore set out that factual history.

    7. The appellant arrived in the UK on 20 June 1993 when she was 7  years
       old  accompanied  by  her  grandmother.  The  circumstances  of   the
       appellant's immigration to the UK was that at the time that there was
       no family member then living in Jamaica to care for her. The aunt who
       had cared for her in the absence of her parents was ill, (she had  to
       all intents and purposes been abandoned by her parents)  and  had  no
       other family members  then  living  in  Jamaica.  The  appellant  was
       granted indefinite leave to remain ('ILR') in 1995.

    8. The appellant as having been diagnosed with schizoaffective  disorder
       in 2005 and it was in March 2005 was first detained under the  Mental
       Health Act. The FtTJ observed that the information available  to  the
       Tribunal had been incomplete despite having convened case  management
       hearings and having made directions  for  evidence  to  be  obtained.
       However, he set out within the  decision  the  factual  circumstances
       which were accepted by  the  respondent.  They  can  be  set  out  as
       follows:-

             1.  The  appellant  has  been  prescribed  medication  for  her
                condition for a number of years;

             2. Her mental health deteriorated between the years 2005 - 2007
                (at [E2]);

             3. The CMHT noted in March  2007  that  her  mental  state  was
                extreme fragile, she was without a fixed address so that she
                was extremely vulnerable to  exploitation  and  invited  the
                local authority to invoke its  safeguarding  procedures.  It
                was not known on the evidence before  the  Tribunal  whether
                that in fact had been carried out or if it had, what success
                there had been.

             4. The appellant had been detained under the MHA  on  at  least
                two occasions (although the FtTJ had no record or chronology
                of her interactions with the mental of teams in  the  places
                she resided);

             5. She is recorded as having a history of drug abuse  (cannabis
                since 2009 as set out in the GPs notes and not as  the  JWCI
                letter suggests at [K2}) and is recorded as having attempted
                suicide on two occasions (see  paragraph  3(e)  of  the  FtT
                decision).

    9. The appellant has a child born in 2009. Again, the FtTJ recorded that
       there was little information available concerning  his  circumstances
       and there was no evidence from family members who now care  for  him.
       The FtTJ did have evidence that he was a looked  after  child  for  a
       period between 2010 and 2011 and the inference raised  was  that  was
       one of the occasions when the appellant's mental health  deteriorated
       had been detained. The judge inferred from the evidence that at  some
       stage a child was placed  with  a  family  relative  under  what  was
       understood to be a private fostering arrangement and that the  family
       had always lived in a different area. There was  no  evidence  before
       the Tribunal as to whether there had been any public law proceedings,
       or any orders made. However the judge recorded at  paragraph  6  that
       the appellant's evidence was that she had the right  to  contact  her
       son although she had not been well enough to exercise direct  contact
       with him. She had last spoken to him approximately four months ago.

   10. During her residence in United Kingdom, the appellant has  a  history
       of criminal offending.

             i) The appellant's offending began in 2014 when she  was  first
                convicted of theft from the dwelling and received a 12-month
                conditional  discharge,  compensation  and  payment  of  the
                victim surcharge.

            ii) There were further offences  of  theft  for  which  she  was
                sentenced to in August 2014 and in 2015 which resulted in  a
                community order. It is recorded that this was later revoked,
                and she received a suspended sentence of imprisonment for 14
                days, suspended for six months.

           iii) In 2015 was convicted of shoplifting, failing  to  surrender
                custody  and  commission  a  further  offending  during  the
                operational period of the suspended sentence order  and  was
                therefore sentenced to a  total  of  14  days  imprisonment.
                Later in that  year  further  offences  of  shoplifting  and
                received 20 days imprisonment with a further seven  days  to
                be served consecutively.

            iv) In February 2016 she was convicted of possessing a  class  a
                controlled drug and was sentenced to community order with an
                exclusion requirement, a drug rehabilitation requirement and
                in rehabilitation activity requirement.

             v) In April 2016 she was convicted of battery and was sentenced
                to 12 weeks imprisonment. This was  shortly  followed  by  a
                further conviction for shoplifting  which  was  carried  out
                whilst the community order was in force. She  was  sentenced
                to 8 weeks imprisonment. In July 2016 she was  convicted  of
                further shoplifting and received  a  sentence  of  12  weeks
                imprisonment to be suspended for 24 months.

            vi) In August 2016 she was convicted of  possessing  a  class  a
                controlled drug but received no separate penalty.

           vii) In November 2016 she was convicted  of  burglary  and  theft
                (non-dwelling) and the commission  further  offences  during
                the operational period  of  a  suspended  sentence.  At  the
                magistrates  court  she  received  a  total  of   24   weeks
                imprisonment. As the judge records,  this  was  the  longest
                individual term of immediate imprisonment imposed  upon  the
                appellant which followed the  activation  of  the  suspended
                sentence imposed upon in October 2016 in relation  to  theft
                offences for which he been convicted in July 2016.

          viii) In 2017 she was convicted of theft on two occasions.

   11. In respect of that antecedent history, it is recorded in  the  FtTJ's
       decision that the judge had raised a number  of  points  during  case
       management hearings which the respondent was unable to  answer.  They
       concerned the appellant's mental health and  whether  that  had  been
       taken into account (in accordance with published policy) and  whether
       the  magistrates  courts  who  had   sentenced   the   appellant   to
       imprisonment in 2015 and 2016 were aware of her medical condition. It
       is further recorded that he had requested the respondent  to  provide
       information about the offences themselves beyond  that  contained  in
       the PNC and the brief extracts that were in the evidence before  him.
       The respondent did not provide that information to the FtTJ.

   12. As a result of that antecedent history it was  common  ground  before
       the FtTJ that the appellant fell within the definition of a  "foreign
       criminal" in section 117D(c)(iii) and as a "persistent offender".  By
       reason of her convictions, it was not  suggested  on  behalf  of  the
       Secretary of State that she  fell  within  any  other  limb  of  that
       section and therefore it was accepted on behalf of the appellant that
       she was liable to deportation and that section 117C (1)  applied  (it
       is in the public interest that foreign criminals should  be  deported
       from the UK).

   13. The judge recorded the position of the respondent at  paragraph  [13]
       that individually none of the appellant offences could  be  described
       as serious and it was common ground that this was  "persistent  petty
       offending" and that despite the persistence, the lack of  seriousness
       in the individual offences had consequences for the  "sliding  scale"
       of the strength of the public interest  in  deportation  set  out  in
       section 117C2. The FtTJ considered that the appellant  did  not  face
       the enhanced public interest in deportation faced by those who  would
       have committed more serious offences but  nonetheless  that  did  not
       mean that there was no public interest in her deportation, as set out
       in section 117C(1).

   14. The FtTJ set out a summary of the appellant's case at paragraphs [20]-
       [22] and that the appellant pursued human rights claim based  upon  a
       breach of both her article 3 and article 8 rights.

   15. In respect of article 3, it was argued that the  appellant  continued
       to pose a risk of suicide (although the judge recorded there  was  no
       evidence to support that argument) and that secondly, the combination
       of her circumstances and conditions in Jamaica for those perceived to
       be criminal deportees was such that there was a real  risk  that  her
       article 3 rights be breached. This was based on the  submission  that
       she  had  no  means  of  support  in  Jamaica  and  no  prospects  of
       employment. The consequences of mental health and drug addiction were
       that she would be unlikely to apply for a grant  on  her  behalf  and
       therefore could not manage in Jamaica. This would lead to destitution
       and she would be at risk of serious exploitation.

   16. The article 8 argument advanced on behalf of the appellant  was  that
       she met the exceptions in both Exception 1 and Exception 2, or in the
       alternative the appellant was able to establish that there were "very
       compelling circumstances" (see S117C (6)) which displaced the  public
       interest in her deportation. The basis of that argument was that  the
       public interest arose not because of the  individual  seriousness  of
       any offence, but only because of the  persistence  of  the  offending
       which is at the lowest end of the scale. The offending behaviour  had
       to be viewed in its proper context, alongside the  length  of  lawful
       residence, the lack of any offending behaviour  prior  to  2014,  her
       mental health, her substance abuse and addiction and the lack of  any
       clarity as to whether the appellant had ever been considered  as  one
       who should receive treatment rather  than  punishment.  Additionally,
       she lived in the UK all of her life and  never  returned  to  Jamaica
       since her arrival as a young child in 1993  and  had  no  friends  or
       family to provide her with support in any event of her deportation.

   17. By way of response, the respondent's case was that  set  out  in  the
       decision letter of 20 September  2017;  that  she  was  a  persistent
       offender and that on the factual circumstances  neither  Exception  1
       nor Exception 2 or the "very compelling circumstances"  test  applied
       in her case and therefore the public interest required to deportation
       pursuant to section 117C(3).

   18. The judge observed at [22] that none of  the  relevant  jurisprudence
       was referred to or provided before  the  Tribunal  when  hearing  the
       appeal. None the less, the FtTJ directed himself in  accordance  with
       the relevant legal principles set  out  in  the  case  law  which  he
       recited at [24].

   19. The FtTJ set out his findings of fact and analysis  of  the  evidence
       over a number of paragraphs from [25]-[84]. As I  have  stated,  they
       are comprehensive and do not fail to address any of the  points  made
       by the advocates.

   20. The FtTJ's decision makes reference to ss. 117A-117C of the 2002  Act
       and for convenience I set out the relevant extracts.

   21. These fall within Part 5A of the 2002 Act, which  was  inserted  into
       it, with effect from 28 July 2014, by section 19 of  the  Immigration
       Act 2014.  Part 5A is headed "Article 8 of the ECHR: Public  Interest
       Considerations" and includes the following.

           "117A Application of this Part

           (1)    This Part applies where a court or tribunal  is  required
                to determine whether a decision made under  the  Immigration
                Acts -

                (a)    breaches a person's right to respect for private  and
                    family life under article 8, and

                (b)    as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of  the
                    Human Rights Act 1998.

           (2)    In considering the public interest question, the court or
                tribunal must (in particular) have regard -

                (a)    in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
                    117B ...

           (3)    In subsection (2), 'the public interest  question'  means
                the question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's
                right to respect for private and family  life  is  justified
                under article 8(2).

           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases

           The maintenance of effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the
           public interest.

           ...

           (4)    Little weight should be given to -

                (a)    a private life, or

                (b)    a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that
                    is established by a person at a time when the person  is
                    in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

           (5)     Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
                established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
                immigration status is precarious

           ..."

   22. S.117B is followed by this at s. 117C:

           "Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign
           criminals

             1) The deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
                interest.

             2)  The  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
                criminal, the greater is the public interest in  deportation
                of the criminal.

             3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C")  who  has  not  been
                sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more,
                the  public  interest  requires   C's   deportation   unless
                Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.

             4) Exception 1 applies where-

                (a)    C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom
                    for most of C's life,

                (b)    C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                    Kingdom, and

                (c)    there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                    integration into the country to which C is  proposed  to
                    be deported.

             5) Exception 2 applies where C has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
                relationship with a qualifying partner,  or  a  genuine  and
                subsisting parental relationship with  a  qualifying  child,
                and the effect of C's deportation on the  partner  or  child
                would be unduly harsh.

             6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to
                a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the  public
                interest  requires  deportation  unless   there   are   very
                compelling circumstances, over and above those described  in
                Exceptions 1 and 2.

   23. The FtTJ reached the conclusion that Exception 1 was met.   The  FtTJ
       found that the appellant was lawfully resident in the UK for most  of
       her life having entered the UK lawfully the  day  before  her  eighth
       birthday, had  been  granted  ILR  therefore  she  had  a  period  of
       continuous lawful residence of 24 years from 1993 until the making of
       the deportation order in 2017 (see [37]).   The  respondent  accepted
       her history and in the decision letter (page 9)  also  accepted  that
       she had been lawfully resident in the UK for most of her life.

   24. As to whether she was culturally and socially  integrated  here  this
       was in dispute. The decision letter stated that the respondent  would
       accept a degree of social and  cultural  integration  but  noted  her
       offending and that she had not provided any evidence of her education
       in the UK or any periods of employment  or  voluntary  work.  It  was
       stated that presence in the UK was not integration (see page 9 of the
       decision letter).

   25. At paragraphs [38]- [43], the  FTT  J  analysed  a  number  of  legal
       authorities in those paragraphs.  The FtTJ

   26. The grounds advanced on behalf of  the  respondent  do  not  seek  to
       challenge the FtTJ's findings that she met limb 2 and  that  she  was
       socially and culturally integrated in the UK.  I  have  set  out  his
       findings  as  it  is  relevant  to  the  issue  of  very   compelling
       circumstances which was the alternative basis  upon  which  the  FtTJ
       allowed the appeal.

   27. The FTT also found that there would be very significant obstacles  to
       the appellant's integration to Jamaica.

   28. There are factors identified in Maslov  v  Austria  [2008]  ECHR  546
       relevant to the 'pros' side of the balance sheet  which  prima  facie
       increased the weight to be given to  the  appellant's  private  life:
       the appellant has  spent the major part of her childhood in  the  UK,
       she arrived in the UK when he was 7 and spent a significant  part  of
       her childhood in the UK; she has spent the majority of  her  life  in
       the UK and is closely socially and culturally integrated in  the  UK;
       she had no link to Jamaica and she faced very  significant  obstacles
       to integrating there.



The submissions of the parties:

   29. Ms Petterson on behalf  of  the  respondent  relied  on  the  written
       grounds.

   30. I shall set out those written grounds. It is submitted that the judge
       erred  in  his  consideration  and  finding  that  there  were  "very
       significant   obstacles   to   integration"   or   "very   compelling
       circumstances" existing for the  appellant.  The  grounds  go  on  to
       state:

           "having accepted that the appellant is a foreign criminal with a
           serious risk of reoffending [35] with  treatment  available  for
           her  for  her  schizoaffective  disorder  the  onus  is  on  the
           appellant to demonstrate that she would not be  able  to  access
           this treatment, it is submitted that this has not been done.  At
           [76] the FTT J finds that the risk on return  to  the  appellant
           come "if" she is unable to access or failed  to  regularly  take
           her medication, however it is respectfully  submitted  that  the
           FTT J has not effectively considered this and it is not made out
           that she is unable to access treatment. It is submitted that the
           evidence  is  not  conclusive  that   the   appellant   requires
           assistance to access and take the treatment.

           It is further submitted  that  the  FTT  J  failed  to  consider
           whether  her  aunt  and  cousin  who  currently  care  for   the
           appellant's  child  would  be  in  a  position  to  assist  with
           reintegration into Jamaica through visits or travelling with the
           appellant until she settled, only considering it [76) that there
           is no realistic prospect of a relative relocating  to  care  for
           her."

   31. Ms Petterson also relied upon the grant of permission by  UTJ  Pickup
       on 28 August 2090 in which he stated that it was  arguable  that  the
       judge gave insufficient consideration as to  whether  family  members
       could assist with integration in Jamaica on  a  temporary  basis.  No
       further submissions were made at the hearing.

   32. There was no rule 24 response on behalf of the appellant.  Ms  Brakaj
       submitted that there was no error of law in the analysis of the  FtTJ
       and that this was a decision which had been fully reasoned.

   33. She submitted that the failure to consider family members had been an
       issue raised in the grounds  the  first  time  whereas  it  had  been
       accepted before the FtTJ that she had no assistance  from  family  in
       the UK. The appellant had no contact with family  members,  and  this
       was made clear in the case management hearings which had been held to
       determine the evidence concerning  the  relationship  with  her  son.
       There had been no contact or any support letters from members of  the
       family despite the enquiries that were made. The position was that as
       set out in the medical report at page 9 the appellant had been  moved
       to a different area. The safeguarding  minutes  were  silent  on  the
       issue of family support and did not acknowledged any form  of  family
       assistance  which  was  consistent  with  the   appellant's   witness
       statement. She submitted the she had struggled significantly  in  her
       accommodation and that there was no indication family help. Had there
       been so, it was not likely that she would have been moved from X city
       to another city. Consequently, the lack of  family  members  and  her
       lack of contact with them was not an issue that was in dispute.

   34. As to the appellant's ability to obtain treatment for herself, it was
       submitted that the judge gave full consideration to this at paragraph
       53 and his assessment of the evidence at  paragraphs  48  -  50.  She
       submitted that nothing further and been provided by the respondent in
       respect of any country materials and the references in  the  decision
       of the FTT J related to the appellant's evidence. Thus there  was  no
       dispute to the background evidence, and it was difficult to see  what
       further the FTT J could have done when considering the issues in  the
       appeal.

   35. Ms Brakaj therefore invited the Tribunal to find that  there  was  no
       material error of law in the decision of the FtTJ and that it  should
       stand. No further submissions were made by way of reply on behalf  of
       the respondent.

   36. At the end of the submissions I reserved my  decision,  which  I  now
       provide with reasons.

Discussion:

   37. Whilst neither of the advocates addressed  the  Tribunal  as  to  the
       legal principles relevant to this appeal, they are not in dispute and
       are set out in a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal  and  the
       Supreme Court.

   38. The statutory provisions at s.117A-C provide a  "particularly  strong
       statement of public policy" - see NA (Pakistan) v SSHD [2017]  1  WLR
       207 at [22], such that "great weight" should generally be given to it
       and cases in which that public interest  will  be  outweighed,  other
       than  those  specified  in  the  statutory   provisions   and   Rules
       themselves, "are likely to be a very small minority" (see Hesham  Ali
       v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60 at [38], i.e. will be rare - NA  (Pakistan)  at
       [33].

   39. As set out at paragraphs [21] and [22] of KO (Nigeria) that exception
       1 is "self-contained" and "leaves no room for further balancing".  In
       other words, a foreign criminal sentenced to less than four years who
       is able to meet the three requirements in exception 1, is entitled to
       have his Article 8 appeal allowed.  There is no additional obligation
       to conduct a balancing exercise that attaches little weight to that
       appellant's private life in the UK or balances private life against
       the public interest, including the seriousness of the offending.

   40. In the alternative, the position  is  different  where  an  appellant
       cannot meet Exception 1 or 2.  The wide-ranging  evaluative  exercise
       required by s. 117C(6) necessarily includes  an  application  of  the
       public interest considerations in s. 117B  and  a  balancing  of  the
       public interest, including the seriousness of the offending - see the
       clarification provided by Lane J in MS

   41. In MS the President of the Upper Tribunal, Lane J (sitting in a panel
       with UTJs Gill and Coker)  considered  the  correct  approach  to  s.
       117C(6) with the benefit of the guidance provided in KO  (Nigeria)  v
       SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 and NA (Pakistan) (supra), and said this:

           "16.   By  contrast,  the  issue  of  whether  "there  are  very
           compelling circumstances, over  and  above  those  described  in
           Exceptions 1 and 2" is not in any sense a  hard-edged  question.
           On  the  contrary,  it  calls  for  a  wide-ranging   evaluative
           exercise. As NA (Pakistan) holds, that exercise is required,  in
           the case of all foreign criminals, in order to ensure that  Part
           5A of the 2002 Act produces, in each such case, a result that is
           compatible with the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8
           of the ECHR.

           17.    Viewed in this light, it can readily  be  seen  that  the
           ascertainment    of    what    constitute    "very    compelling
           circumstances", such as to defeat the public interest,  requires
           a case-specific analysis of the nature of the  public  interest.
           The strength of the public interest,  in  any  particular  case,
           determines the weight that must then be  found  to  lie  on  the
           foreign  criminal's  side  of  the  balance  in  order  for  the
           circumstances to be properly categorised as very compelling.  It
           would, frankly, be remarkable if  a  person  sentenced  to  four
           years' imprisonment  for  fraud  had  to  demonstrate  the  same
           circumstances as a person sentenced  to  life  imprisonment  for
           multiple murders.

           18.    To say this is not to  seek  to  introduce  a  "balancing
           exercise" into Exceptions 1  and  2  and  the  test  of  "unduly
           harsh". The words "over and above", as interpreted by Jackson LJ
           in  NA  (Pakistan),  underscore  the  difference  in  the  tasks
           demanded by, on the one hand, section 117C(4) and  (5)  and,  on
           the other, section 117C(6).

           19.    Furthermore, as Mr Pilgerstorfer pointed out, the  effect
           of the judgment  in  NA  (Pakistan),  in  bringing  all  foreign
           criminals within the ambit of section 117C(6), means that it  is
           difficult to see how the test of very  compelling  circumstances
           can operate differently,  depending  upon  whether  the  foreign
           criminal has, or has not, been sentenced to imprisonment  of  at
           least 4 years. In order for it to do so, yet further words would
           have to be assumed to be written  into  the  section,  over  and
           above those mandated by the Court of Appeal's judgment.

           20.     For  these  reasons,   despite   Ms   Patyna's   elegant
           submissions, we find the effect of section 117C is that a  court
           or tribunal, in determining whether there  are  very  compelling
           circumstances, as required by subsection  (6),  must  take  into
           account the seriousness of the particular offence for which  the
           foreign criminal was convicted, together with any other relevant
           public interest considerations. Nothing in KO (Nigeria)  demands
           a contrary conclusion."

   42. The  wide-ranging  evaluative  exercise  required  under  s.  117C(6)
       clearly includes an application of the principles in  the  Strasbourg
       authorities.   As NA (Pakistan) holds, the  s.  117C(6)  exercise  is
       required to ensure compatibility  with  the  UK's  obligations  under
       Article 8 of the ECHR.  In addition, the judgment in  NA  (Pakistan),
       given by Jackson LJ, reads:

           "29.   ... The phrase used in section 117C (6), in para. 398  of
           the 2014 ... does  not  mean  that  a  foreign  criminal  facing
           deportation is altogether disentitled from seeking  to  rely  on
           matters falling within the scope of the circumstances  described
           in Exceptions 1 and 2 when seeking to contend  that  'there  are
           very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in
           Exceptions 1 and 2'. ... [A] foreign  criminal  is  entitled  to
           rely upon such matters, but he would need to be able to point to
           features of his case of a kind mentioned in Exceptions 1  and  2
           (and in paras. 399 or 399A  of  the  2014  rules),  or  features
           falling outside the circumstances described in those  Exceptions
           and those paragraphs, which made his claim based  on  Article  8
           especially strong.

           30.    In the case of a serious  offender  who  could  point  to
           circumstances in his own case which could be said to  correspond
           to the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2, but  where
           he could only just succeed in such an argument, it would not  be
           possible to describe his situation as involving very  compelling
           circumstances, over and above those described  in  Exceptions  1
           and 2. One might describe that  as  a  bare  case  of  the  kind
           described in Exceptions 1 or 2. On the other hand, if  he  could
           point to factors identified in the descriptions of Exceptions  1
           and 2 of an especially compelling kind in support of an  Article
           8 claim, going well beyond what would be necessary to make out a
           bare case of the kind described in  Exceptions  1  and  2,  they
           could in principle constitute  'very  compelling  circumstances,
           over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and  2',  whether
           taken  by  themselves  or  in  conjunction  with  other  factors
           relevant to application of Article 8."

   43. In Maslov (supra), the Grand Chamber said this:

           "71.   In a case like the present one, where the  person  to  be
           expelled is a young adult who has not yet founded  a  family  of
           his own, the relevant criteria are:

              - the nature and seriousness of the offence committed  by  the
                applicant;

              - the length of the applicant's stay in the country from which
                he or she is to be expelled;

              - the time elapsed since the offence  was  committed  and  the
                applicant's conduct during that period;

              - the solidity of social, cultural and family  ties  with  the
                host country and with the country of destination.

           72.    The Court would also clarify that the age of  the  person
           concerned can play a  role  when  applying  some  of  the  above
           criteria.  For  instance,  when   assessing   the   nature   and
           seriousness of the offences committed by an applicant, it has to
           be taken into account whether he or  she  committed  them  as  a
           juvenile or as  an  adult  (see,  for  instance,  Moustaquim  v.
           Belgium, judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 193, p.  19,
           � 44, and Radovanovic v. Austria, no. 42703/98, � 35,  22  April
           2004).

           73.    In turn, when assessing the  length  of  the  applicant's
           stay in the country from which he or she is to be  expelled  and
           the solidity of the social, cultural and family  ties  with  the
           host country, it evidently makes a difference whether the person
           concerned had already come to the  country  during  his  or  her
           childhood or youth, or was even born there, or whether he or she
           only came as an  adult.  This  tendency  is  also  reflected  in
           various  Council  of  Europe  instruments,  in   particular   in
           Committee of Ministers  Recommendations  Rec  (2001)15  and  Rec
           (2002)4 (see paragraphs 34-35 above).

           74.     Although  Article  8  provides  no  absolute  protection
           against expulsion for any category of aliens  (see  �ner,  cited
           above, � 55), including those who were born in the host  country
           or moved there in their early childhood, the Court  has  already
           found that regard is to be  had  to  the  special  situation  of
           aliens who have spent most, if not all, their childhood  in  the
           host country, were brought up there and received their education
           there (see �ner, � 58 in fine).

           75.    In short, the Court considers that for a settled  migrant
           who has lawfully spent all or the  major  part  of  his  or  her
           childhood and youth in the host country very serious reasons are
           required to justify expulsion. This is all the more so where the
           person concerned committed the offences underlying the expulsion
           measure as a juvenile."

   44. Following Rhuppiah (supra), those with anything less than ILR, have a
       "precarious" immigration status for the purposes of s. 117B(5).   It
       is therefore fully acknowledged on the respondent's behalf that her
       immigration status in the UK has been lawful.

   45. The FtTJ reached the conclusion that the three requirements for
       Exception 1 to apply were met. The first two relate to private life
       in the UK.  As I have set out it was not in dispute that the
       appellant had lawfully resided in the UK for most of her life. Whilst
       the decision letter did not wholly accept that she was socially and
       culturally integrated here, it is clear from reading the decision as
       a whole, that the FtTJ considered the appellant to be socially and
       culturally integrated to the UK, notwithstanding those short periods
       of imprisonment and gave sustainable reasons supported by his
       analysis of her factual circumstances for reaching that view. I have
       set out his full findings earlier. It is sufficient to note that the
       respondent has not sought to challenge the FtTJ's assessment of that
       in the grounds advanced before the Upper Tribunal.

   46. The third requirement in exception 1 focuses upon the appellant's
       likely private life in Jamaica and whether there were very
       significant obstacles to her reintegration to Jamaica.  The FtTJ made
       reference to the relevant legal principles at [80]).

   47. The FtTJ addressed the circumstances for this appellant in Jamaica in
       detail at paragraphs [44]-[55] and [76]-[84].

   48. The respondent challenges this aspect of the FtTJ's decision but does
       so by reference only to two specific findings made; firstly, that the
       onus was on the appellant to demonstrate that she could not access
       treatment for her condition in Jamaica and that the evidence is not
       "conclusive" that the appellant requires assistance to access and
       take the necessary treatment. Secondly, that the FtTJ failed to
       consider whether the aunt or her cousin would be in a position to
       assist with her reintegration to Jamaica through visits or travelling
       with the appellant (at [76]). No other issues are identified, and no
       further argument has been advanced beyond that.

   49. It is plain from reading the decision of the FtTJ that he was
       critical that evidence had not been made available to the Tribunal
       despite holding case management hearings in order to establish the
       particular factual circumstances of the appellant. At [45] the judge
       observed that neither party had offered him any expert evidence upon
       the appellant's ability to integrate into Jamaican culture and at
       [45] the respondent had gone no further than the reasons given for
       the refusal set out at M10-11 and that the respondent relied upon the
       existence of mental health inpatient and outpatient facilities,
       suitably qualified professionals and medication although the
       respondent offered no source for the statistics quoted and no
       evidence to support the assertions that were made despite case
       management over a period of 18 months. It had been argued on behalf
       of the respondent that the appellant's condition was stable and that
       she was neither delusional nor psychotic and that she was compliant
       with her medication. It is also recorded that whilst the presenting
       officer sought to argue that nothing had changed since that
       assessment made by the respondent, she reflected on that position
       having accepted that the content of the medical notes and the
       safeguarding minute meetings indicated that the picture was far from
       so simple.

   50. The judge accepted that there was mental health treatment system in
       Jamaica but one that was "severely overstretched" (ss [48]). In
       reaching that conclusion the FtTJ had analysed the material relied
       upon by the appellant at [47] which consisted of an extract from the
       WHO report on the mental health system in Jamaica of 4/8/09 (AB
       117]). The judge recorded that whilst it was not a contemporary
       report," it is the most cogent available evidence; indeed it may be
       the source of the statistics relied upon by the respondent". The
       report recorded the dearth of professionals working in the field of
       publicly funded mental health due to the poor rates of pay. He noted
       that the lack of social services support and the need to de-
       institutionalised the mental hospital to free up beds and the fact
       that 91 - 95% of all admissions were involuntary. In addition, from
       that report only 1% of persons with mental disability in Jamaica
       received social welfare benefits. He did not accept the material
       referred to at [49] relied upon by the appellant. In addition, he
       placed weight on the letter dated 11 June 2019 and the minutes of the
       safeguarding strategy meetings held with the appellant in every 2019
       in March 2090. He recorded that those minuted remarks were of concern
       and were "elicited how the appellant has reached the positions she
       now finds herself in." He concluded at [51] when read together the
       documents presented a picture of a woman whose ability to cope with
       managing money, with her own care, fluctuated significantly. He
       questioned the consistency of her insight and set out relevant issues
       concerning her vulnerability and that the drug and alcohol abuse
       clearly continued for the reasons set out at [51]. At paragraphs 53 -
       54, the FtTJ further analysed those safeguarding minutes.

   51. His conclusions on this issue began at [76]. The FtTJ stated that in
       his judgement, the appellant circumstances in the event of
       deportation to Jamaica were very likely to be similar to those
       thought likely to be faced by the appellant in KE (Nigeria) and that
       the appellant had no relatives or friends in Jamaica, and there was
       no realistic prospect of any relative relocating to Jamaica to care
       for her or to ensure that she took a medication. He found that if she
       was unable to access or fail to regularly take her medication that
       her schizoaffective disorder would relapse. He found interruption to
       her methadone (which had been referred to in his factual findings at
       [52]), would be likely to cause to return into crime and that given
       her vulnerability she would face a real risk of a breach of article
       3. He found there was no real prospect of finding employment in
       Jamaica or being able to support or house herself from any earnings.

   52. As to family support, he found at [77] there was no prospect of any
       family support from family members living in the UK; her parents
       abandoned her when she was very young and there is no evidence that a
       wider family would be willing or able to take up that burden again.
       He considered whether a grant of money might in theory be available
       to the appellant from the Secretary of State to assist her in her
       reintegration, but he was not satisfied that the appellant herself
       would be able to access it on her own behalf. He further consider
       this issue on the basis of the material before him that even if it
       were successfully made, then the evidence pointed to the likelihood
       of her being unable to manage the money that she would be awarded. He
       found that it would be dissipated by her or for her by those who
       would seek to exploit her upon arrival. Thus he concluded that she
       would be perceived as vulnerable and open to exploitation upon
       arrival (see [77]).

   53. He concluded at [84) that the difficulties likely to be phased in
       Jamaica by the appellant were to be "formidable".

   54. I have set out the FtTJ's findings and analysis at length because it
       demonstrates in my judgment that the respondent's grounds are wholly
       lacking in merit. The FtTJ had regard to the limited evidence
       provided on behalf of the respondent and the limited acceptance made
       by the presenting officer which he set out at paragraph 46, that the
       assertions made in the decision letter were not adequately reflected
       in the evidence set out in the medical notes and the safeguarding
       minutes. He also analysed the evidence on behalf of the appellant,
       and it is plain when considering paragraph 49 that the judge did not
       accept all of that evidence. The submissions made on behalf of the
       respondent offer no real criticism of the FtTJ's analysis of the
       evidence and makes no reference to the material that was before the
       FtTJ. The ground simply assert that there was treatment available for
       her schizoaffective disorder and that she would have to demonstrate
       she could not access this treatment.

   55. When reading the decision of the FtTJ, it is plain in my judgement
       that the FtTJ carried out a full analysis of the evidence before him
       and taking into account the particular circumstances in relation to
       this appellant. He set out the country materials which made reference
       to this severely overstretched mental health treatment in Jamaica.
       However whilst he accepted there was such a treatment system (see 47-
       49), the FtTJ was entitled to take into account the particular
       circumstances of this appellant as outlined in the evidence and in
       particular the safeguarding minutes and the medical notes. He made
       reference to her vulnerability, her fluctuating compliance with the
       medication and to limited insight into her illness. Therefore even if
       the medication and medical facilities were available, overstretched
       as they were, he had given adequate and sustainable reasons as to why
       the appellant would not be able to avail herself of it. Furthermore
       at [76], his analysis of the circumstances in Jamaica for her should
       she not be able to access or fail to take a medication set out a dire
       picture. The only submission made about those findings is that the
       judge did not "effectively consider" the risks. That is plainly not
       the position and I am satisfied that the judge did adequately reason
       his assessment in dealing with the medical evidence.

   56. The second point relied upon by the respondent is that the judge
       failed to consider whether her aunt and cousin are currently caring
       for the appellant's child and would be in a position to assist with
       her reintegration to Jamaica. The circumstances of the appellant were
       considered with evident care by the FtTJ. He had held a number of
       case management hearings in order to obtain evidence particularly in
       relation to the appellant's son. He recorded at a number of places
       within the decision that it had been difficult for the evidence he
       requested to be made available. What is clear from his decision is
       that she had no relationship with any family members in the United
       Kingdom. As Ms Brakaj submits, the appellant's history demonstrates
       that she was moved to different places within the United Kingdom to
       live but none involved any placement or indeed any type of
       relationship with a family member. The judge had no evidence from the
       family members who were caring for the appellants son ( see [58] and
       [66]) and there was no evidence of any visits made by the appellant
       to her son since 2016 since her release from prison. It was therefore
       open to the judge to reach the conclusion that he did at [77] that
       there was no evidence that a wider family would be willing or able to
       take up the burden of providing her with any form of support. The
       respondent's submission in the grounds/grant of permission was made
       on the basis that this family contact could provide her with
       "temporary help" to reintegrate. However the judge also considered at
       [77] whether other forms of assistance as a temporary measure would
       be available and reference made to whether she could access a grant
       but for the reasons given at [77] it was open to him on the evidence
       and in the light of the particular characteristics of the appellant,
       that she would not be able to access it on her own behalf and even if
       she could, the money would be dissipated by her or for her by others
       seeking her exploitation.

   57. Consequently, I am satisfied that the limited grounds advanced before
       the Upper Tribunal concerning Exception 1 are not made out. That
       being the case, it is not necessary to consider the arguments
       advanced that relate to the FtTJ's alternative finding that there
       were "very compelling circumstances" because they rely on the same
       factual issues.

   58. However, even if the  FtTJ  had  been  in  error  in  his  assessment
       (although that has not been otherwise explained by the respondent  in
       any written or oral submissions), I am  further  satisfied  that  the
       FtTJ applied the correct test. In his analysis he undertook the wide-
       ranging evaluative exercise required  under  s117C(6)  which  clearly
       included  an  application  of  the  principles  in   the   Strasbourg
       authorities. When assessing  whether  private  life  contains  strong
       features, it is unlikely that any one factor is determinative, rather
       private life must be viewed holistically and each case will  turn  on
       its facts.  This includes private life that was developed in  the  UK
       as a child as on the facts of this  appeal.    Here,  her  length  of
       lawful residence was for a period of 24 years from the date  of  1993
       until the deportation order was made in October 2017. The judge found
       that between entry to the UK until mid-2014,  there  was  no  dispute
       that she was socially and culturally integrated in the UK having been
       educated since the age of eight and that any difficulties with social
       integration prior to her first conviction was a feature of her mental
       ill-health (see paragraph 43). Whilst he found that  the  passage  of
       time had not led to the formation of significant friendships, she had
       established a private life which "lies at  the  correct  end  of  the
       continuum to count in her favour"  (see  [66]).  He  weighed  in  the
       balance  her  right  to  British  citizenship  (at  [63]),  and   his
       assessment of the circumstances upon return to Jamaica for  her  (set
       out at [76]-[77] and at [84], which he described as "formidable"".

   59. I would accept that in a s. 117C(6) case, there is a  requirement  to
       the seriousness of the particular offence and to balance  the  strong
       public interest in support of deportation against  the  circumstances
       over and above exceptions 1 and 2 - see MS (supra).  I  am  satisfied
       that this is precisely what the FtTJ did.

   60. The FtTJ set out his analysis  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  at
       paragraphs [32- 36]. He took into account that there were 30 offences
       of theft, two offences of drugs possessions and a further 10 offences
       relating to failures to answer bail and offending was the subject  of
       a suspended sentence on bail. His summary of her  offences  have  not
       been in dispute and the theft offences could properly be described as
       shoplifting and petty criminality. As the judge recorded at paragraph
       13, the presenting officer on behalf  the  respondent  accepted  that
       individually none of the offences could be described as serious.  The
       judge also recorded at the same paragraph that "it is  common  ground
       that  this  was  persistent  petty   offending,   and   despite   the
       persistence, the lack of seriousness in the individual  offences  has
       consequences for the "sliding scale" of the strength  of  the  public
       interest in deportation provided for by section 117C(9)").

   61. In his analysis, the FtTJ properly directed himself as to the need to
       consider all matters collectively to  determine  whether  the  public
       interest in deportation could be displaced.  The FtTJ regarded it  as
       sufficient in the particular appeal to measure the seriousness of the
       offending history by reference to when her offending began,  that  is
       in 2014 (see [33]), and that this post-dated by 9 years her diagnosis
       and significantly post-dated the drug addiction that she was recorded
       to have had in 2013. The evidence  of  drug  addiction  predated  the
       first conviction. That said, the FtTJ made it plain that he  did  not
       lose sight of the fact  that  the  drug  addiction  must  necessarily
       involve the commission of criminal offences, even  though  they  were
       never the subject of convictions (at [34]).

   62. The  respondent  offered  no  argument  by  reference  to  any  legal
       principles or by any reference to the FtTJ's decision beyond that  in
       the grounds which related to the availability of treatment for her in
       Jamaica and whether she would have assistance from family members. In
       my judgment, the decision of the FtTJ properly assessed and  analysed
       those issues within the legal framework and gave sustainable  reasons
       as to why he reached the decision he  did  in  a  properly  analysed,
       detailed and comprehensive judgement.

Decision

   63. The decision of the FtTJ does not involve the making of an error on a
       point of law. The appeal by the Secretary of State is  dismissed  and
       the decision of the FtT shall stand.
