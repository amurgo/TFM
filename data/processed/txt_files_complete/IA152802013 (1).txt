                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The Respondent Bassey Moses Bassey was born  on  23  March  1978.   He
      arrived in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2005, with leave to enter as
      a student, which was later extended  to  December  2010  when  he  was
      granted leave to remain until December 2012 as a Tier  1  (Post  Study
      Work) Migrant.  On 8 December 2012, he made an in-time application for
      leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  under  the  Points
      Based System.  That application was refused by the Secretary of  State
      on 22 April 2013; but the  Respondent  successfully  appealed  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal (Tribunal Judge Coleman), the determination  being
      promulgated on 5 December 2013.  The Secretary of  State  now  appeals
      against that determination.

The Law

   2. Paragraph 245DD of  the  Immigration  Rules  (HC  395)  sets  out  the
      requirements an applicant must satisfy to qualify for leave to  remain
      as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  That paragraph provides that:


         "If the applicant meets these requirements, leave to remain will be
         granted. If the applicant does not  meet  these  requirements,  the
         application will be refused."


   3. For this appeal,  the  relevant  requirement  is  found  in  paragraph
      245DD(b):

         "The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35
         to 53 of Appendix A."


   4. Paragraph 36 of Appendix A provides that the available points are  set
      out in Table 4.   The Respondent sought to satisfy the requirements of
      (d) of that table which were, at the date of the Secretary of  state's
      decision in this case, as follows:

         "(d)     The applicant:
             (i)  is applying for leave to remain,

             (ii)     has, or was last granted, leave as a  Tier  1  (Post-
             Study Work) Migrant,

             (iii)    was, on  a  date  falling  within  the  three  months
             immediately prior to the date of application,

                  (1)  registered with  HM  Revenue  and  Customs  as  self-
                       employed, or

                  (2)  registered as  a  new  business  in  which  he  is  a
                       director, or

                  (3)  registered as a director of an existing business,

             (iv)     is working in an occupation which appears on the list
             of occupations skilled to  National  Qualifications  Framework
             level 4 or above, as  stated  in  the  Codes  of  Practice  in
             Appendix J, and provides the specified evidence  in  paragraph
             41-SD.  'Working' in this context means that the core  service
             his business provides to its customers or clients involves the
             business delivering a service in an occupation at this  level.
             It excludes any work involved in administration, marketing  or
             website functions for the business, and

             (v)  has access to not less than �50,000.

      To obtain the requisite points, the table requires the money  referred
      to in (v) to be held in one or more regulated financial  institutions,
      and to be disposable in the United Kingdom.


   5. Of these  requirements,  it  is  common  ground  that  the  Respondent
      satisfied  those  in  (d)(i)-(iii).   This  appeal  focuses   on   the
      requirements in (d)(iv) and (v).


   6. With regard to Table 4(d)(iv),  Appendix  J  to  the  Rules  sets  out
      relevant  skill  levels,  in  the  form   of   Standard   Occupational
      Classification (SOC) codes which are based on  the  comprehensive  SOC
      scheme designed for the Office of National Statistics.  The scheme  is
      designed to cover all jobs.   Paragraphs 2 and 3 of  the  Introduction
      to Appendix J indicate that, where in the Rules a job or occupation is
      relevant, the most appropriate match  for  that  job  within  the  SOC
      scheme, as set out in the tables in the appendix, is based on the  job
      description, i.e. on what the job in fact involves.  The various  jobs
      in the scheme  are  defined  by  reference  to  "Example  job  tasks",
      "Related job titles", and "Salary rates" for both  "New  entrant"  and
      "Experienced".  Having categorised all jobs thus, the scheme allocates
      them to levels within a hierarchy  known  as  National  Qualifications
      Framework ("NQF").

   7. In his application, the Respondent said  that  he  held  the  post  of
      Marketing Manager in  a  company  called  E-Business  and  E-Marketing
      Enterprise  Limited  which  offered  various  services  to   web-based
      business.  He did not give an SOC code  in  the  application,  but  Mr
      Junior submitted that he fell within SOC code 1132, "Marketing & Sales
      Manager"; and the Secretary of State always understood that he claimed
      to fall within that coded occupation.

   8. SOC code 1132 falls into NQF level 6.  The  "Example  job  tasks"  for
      that occupation are as follows:

        "Example job tasks:

            . Liaises with other senior staff to  determine  the  range  of
              goods and services to be sold;

            . Discusses employer's and  clients'  requirements,  plans  and
              monitors  surveys  and  analyses   customers'   reaction   to
              products;

            . Controls the recruitment and training of staff;

            .  Produces  and/or  assesses   reports   and   recommendations
              concerning marketing and sales strategies."

      The  "Related  job  titles"  are  "Marketing  director"   and   "Sales
      director".  The salary rates are �28,500 for a new entrant and �44,200
      for an experienced person.

   9. Paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules  provides  that
      the evidence referred to in Table 4(d)  -  which  the  applicant  must
      provide with his application - was, at the relevant time, as follows:

        "(i)      his job title,
        (ii)      the Standard Occupational Classification ("SOC") code  of
        the occupation that the applicant is working in, which must  appear
        on the list of occupations skilled to [NQF] level 4  or  above,  as
        stated in the Codes of Practice in Appendix J,
        (iii)  one or more of the following specified documents:
             (1)   advertising or marketing material, including printouts of
                 online advertising, that  has  been  published  locally  or
                 nationally, showing the applicant's name (and the  name  of
                 the business if  applicable)  together  with  the  business
                 activity,
             (2)   article(s) or online links to article(s) in  a  newspaper
                 or other publication showing the applicant's name (and  the
                 name of the  business  if  applicable)  together  with  the
                 business activity,
             (3)   information from a trade fair(s), at which the  applicant
                 has had a stand or  given  a  presentation  to  market  his
                 business, showing the applicant's name (and the name of the
                 business  if  applicable)  together   with   the   business
                 activity, or
             (4)   personal registration with a UK trade body linked to  the
                 applicant's occupation; and
        (iv)      one or more of contracts showing trading.  If a  contract
        is not an original the applicant must sign each page. The  contract
        must show:
             (a)   the applicant's name and the name of the business,
             (b)   the service provided by the applicant's business; and
             (c)   the name of the other party or parties  involved  in  the
                 contract and their contact details,  including  their  full
                 address, postal code and, where available,  landline  phone
                 number and any email address."


      We pause to mark that these provisions are  not  now  current  -  they
      change frequently, and were amended from 1 October 2013 (HC 628).



  10. Similarly, paragraph 41-SD(c) of Appendix A  sets  out  the  specified
      documents to show evidence of available funding for  the  purposes  of
      Table 4(d)(v) including, by sub-paragraph  (i),  a  letter  from  each
      financial institution holding the funds to confirm that the  money  is
      available.  That sub-paragraph sets out thirteen requirements for such
      a letter, including the following relevant to this appeal:




             "... Each letter must:

             ...

             (6)  state the applicant's name...,

             ...

             (10)  confirm the amount of  money  available  from  any  third
             party (if applicable) that is held in that institution,

             (11)  confirm the name of each third party  and  their  contact
             details, including their full address including post code,  and
             where  available  landline  telephone  number  and  any   email
             address,

             ..."










The Respondent' Application



  11. The Respondent provided the following  documents  in  support  of  his
      application which, we remind ourselves, was made on 8 December 2012.



  12. In respect of the requirements in Table 4(d)(iv), he  provided  (i)  a
      printout of a web advertisement on Craiglist, dated  7  December  2012
      and timed at 19.31 (ii) a screen  capture  of  a  blog  in  which  the
      Respondent described  his  business,  the  print  out  being  dated  7
      December 2012 and timed at 19.32,  (iii)  a  Companies  House  Current
      Appointments  Report  for  the  company  E-Business  and   E-Marketing
      Enterprise Limited, showing that it was created on 7 December 2012  at
      19.38, it had a paid up capital of  �1  and  the  Respondent  was  the
      secretary and sole director, and (iv) a contract dated 4 December 2012
      between the company and Reja Global for "consultancy on e-commerce  as
      per client's requirement" from 1 February to 31 July  2013  at  �1,000
      per month.



  13.  In respect of the requirements of Table 4(d)(v), he provided:



           i) A bank statement for an account with Ecobank Nigeria  Ltd  in
              the name of Akpakpan Monday  John,  dated  3  November  2012,
              showing a credit of just over $150,000 as at that  date,  all
              but about $6,000 having been transferred into the account two
              days previously.  The statement has this endorsement  on  it,
              signed by the Branch Manager:




                    "This is to confirm that Mr  Akpakpan  Monday  John  has
                    been  maintaining  a   bank   account   bearing   number
                    0202058549 at this bank.  Mr Akpakpan Monday John has US
                    Dollar  $151,071.42  in  his  own  name  available   for
                    investment  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  this  date  03
                    November 2012."




              The Respondent's name is nowhere shown.




          ii) A declaration by Mr John dated  31  October  2012  confirming
              that he has that amount in that bank that day, and saying:




                    "... [O]ut of  this  amount  I  will  make  GBP  $85,000
                    available to Mr Bassey Moses  Bassey  for  his  proposed
                    business in the United  Kingdom.   The  above  mentioned
                    fund is ready for disposal in the United Kingdom for the
                    applicant's proposed business if his Tier 1 Entrepreneur
                    application is granted as applying for."




              The declaration gives Mr  John's  personal  details,  and  is
              signed by Mr John.




         iii) A letter from Mr Smart Esheet, an attorney-at-law,  dated  31
              October 2012, confirming the declaration was duly made by  Mr
              John.





The First-tier Tribunal Determination



  14. It is unfortunate  that  the  decision  letter  dated  22  April  2013
      referred to an  out-of-date  version  of  Table  4(d)(iv),  one  which
      changed to that set out above on 13 December 2012.  The version relied
      upon was as follows, namely that the applicant:

              "is  engaged  in  business  activity,  other  than  the  work
              necessary to administer his business, in an occupation  which
              appears on  the  list  of  occupations  skilled  to  National
              Qualifications Framework level 4 or above, as stated  in  the
              Codes of Practice in Appendix J, and provides  the  specified
              evidence in paragraph 41-SD."


      That was also the version considered at the hearing before the  First-
      tier Tribunal.  The main change in December 2012 was that "engaged  in
      business activity" was replaced by simply "working"; but, importantly,
      both versions require the applicant to show that he is engaged in  "an
      occupation which  appears  on  the  list  of  occupations  skilled  to
      National Qualifications Framework level  4  or  above".   Furthermore,
      references to business activity are still found in the current version
      of Table 4(a)(iii)(1), (2) and  (3).   Consequently,  rightly  in  our
      view, neither party before us suggested that the change  was  material
      in this appeal.




  15. Before Judge Coleman, it was submitted on behalf of the  Secretary  of
      State that, in the context of a requirement under Table 4(d)(iv)  that
      the applicant was working in an occupation at SOC level 4  or  higher,
      the Respondent had produced insufficient evidence that he was  engaged
      in business activity.  Only one advertisement had been  produced,  and
      that was  on  an  open  pubic  platform;  the  blog  post  had  little
      information about the business provided;  and  the  contract  did  not
      comply with the rules because it did not have the Respondent's name on
      it.  Furthermore, the financial evidence was  deficient,  because  the
      bank statement/endorsement did not have the Respondent's name  on  it,
      as required; nor did it make clear that the funds  were  available  to
      the Respondent (although Mr John's declaration was to that effect).



  16. The judge rejected those submissions.  She found that  the  Respondent
      had, in substance, complied with the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-
      SD(c) of Appendix A.  An online advertisement  on  a  public  platform
      satisfied the requirement for "advertising or marketing  material"  in
      (ii)(1).  The contract did not  contain  the  Respondent's  name;  but
      that, said the judge, fell within the "evidential flexibility  policy"
      of the Secretary of State: had the Secretary of State raised the issue
      with the Respondent, he could easily have rectified that default.  The
      contract did not have to show "business activity": "Again that is  not
      required by the Rules", she said (paragraph 19).  In  respect  of  the
      financial information, the Judge held that, where there  was  a  third
      party investor, the required letter from the bank  need  not  say  how
      much money is available to the investor - that could be dealt with, as
      in this case, by a declaration from the investor himself.



  17. In the event, she allowed the appeal.





The Grounds of Appeal



  18. Mr Deller relied on two substantive grounds of appeal:



           Ground 1: The judge erred in stating that the contract need  not
           evidence business activity, and proceeding on the basis that the
           Respondent did not  need  to  show  business  activity.    Table
           4(d)(iii)(1),  (2)  and  (3)  all  still  referred  to  business
           activity; and (iv) referred to "trading".  The Rules do  require
           an applicant to show business activity, in  the  context  of  an
           occupation at NQF level 4 or higher; and the  evidence  produced
           by the Respondent in this case was insufficient to do so.




           Ground 2: On the evidence submitted with  the  application,  the
           Respondent had failed  to  satisfy  a  number  of  the  detailed
           specific requirements in the Rules, namely (i) a letter  from  a
           financial institution holding the relevant funds confirming  the
           amount available to the applicant and specifically  naming  him;
           and (ii) a contract  incorporating  the  applicant's  name,  the
           evidential flexibility policy having no application.




Ground 1



  21. It is clear from her determination read as a whole  (but  particularly
      from paragraphs 18-19) that the Judge proceeded on the basis that, for
      an application for leave to remain as an  entrepreneur,  an  applicant
      does not have to show any particular level of business  activity,  and
      that the requirements of Table  4(d)(iv)  are  met  if  the  specified
      evidence required by paragraph 41SD of Appendix A is supplied.



  22. However, Table 4(d)(iv) imposes  two  discrete  requirements  upon  an
      applicant.  First, he is required to  show  that  he  is  "engaged  in
      business activity" (or, now,  "working")  "  in  an  occupation  which
      appears on the list  of  occupations  skilled  to  [NQF]  level  4  or
      above...".   Second,  he  is  required  to  "[provide]  the  specified
      evidence in paragraph 41-SD".   The  relationship  between  these  two
      requirements is clear: although the occupation requirement  cannot  be
      satisfied without provision of the specified documents (see  paragraph
      39B of the Immigration Rules), if those documents are provided that is
      not necessarily  sufficient  to  satisfy  a  decision-maker  that  the
      applicant is indeed working in an occupation of at least NQF level  4.
      Therefore,  even  where  the  specified  evidence   requirements   are
      satisfied, the applicant must still show that  he  has  satisfied  the
      occupation requirement.



  23. An applicant has to identify and show the SOC  occupation  which  most
      closely fits the job which  he  or  she  does,  by  reference  to  the
      functions, duties and responsibilities of that job.   However,  to  be
      able to do that and show that the job is at NQF level 4 or higher, the
      business itself must be of such size and  standing  that  it  requires
      someone to fulfil the substantive functions of a job at  the  relevant
      level; and the applicant must be the person who fulfils that function.





  24. Although the provisions require the business to  be  up-and-running  -
      hence the need, e.g., to provide evidence  of  business  activity  and
      trading - the SOC provisions refer to "new entrants", and  the  nature
      of entrepreneurship means that a business may  be  at  only  an  early
      stage when an application  for  leave  as  an  entrepreneur  is  made.
      However, where the level of trading at the date of application is only
      modest, an applicant may still  be  able  to  satisfy  the  occupation
      requirement of Table 4(d)(iv), for example by showing that  there  are
      plans and strategies for growth and, on the basis of  those  plans,  a
      reasonable prospect of  the  business  growing  to  such  a  size  and
      standing that it will warrant someone performing the functions  of  an
      job at NQF level 4 or higher.  Given that an applicant is required  to
      have a minimum amount of investment capital available - in  this  case
      �50,000 - if the business  venture  is  seriously  intending  to  have
      employees (or even a single employee) at that level, whilst of  course
      one cannot be prescriptive, usually there will be  available  business
      plans for how that investment will be made and how the business is  to
      be structured and run.  Therefore, in an application, it is open to an
      applicant to show that, despite the early stage at which his  business
      might be, there are firm plans and intentions for it to be of  such  a
      size and standing that, in due course,  it  will  require  someone  to
      perform functions, duties and responsibilities in a particular job  at
      NQF level 4 or higher, and that person will be the applicant.



  25. However, all of that needs an evidential foundation.  It is  obviously
      insufficient for an applicant merely to assert that he or she  aspires
      to and intends setting up a business, even where  that  applicant  can
      show access to sufficient funds.



  26. In this case, there was and is no such evidential foundation.   As  at
      the date of the application, there was no evidence that the Respondent
      performed any of the "Example job tasks" set out in paragraph 8 above,
      or anything like.  There was no evidence that  he  had  performed  any
      services for anyone;  and,  although  he  produced  the  contract  for
      services for a period in 2013, he provided  no  evidence   that  there
      were (or were in future to be) any other staff  than  himself.   There
      was  no  evidence  that  he   produced   or   assessed   reports   and
      recommendations concerning marketing and sales strategy, or even  that
      he had any such strategy.  There was no suggestion that the Respondent
      had any plan for the future of the business.



  27. Unfortunately, the Judge in this case simply failed  to  grapple  with
      all the relevant issues.  In our view, she focused  too  much  on  the
      specific  evidence  required  by  paragraph  41-SD,  without  properly
      considering the more fundamental question of what  the  Respondent  in
      fact did, and what he might  reasonably  be  expected  to  do  in  the
      future; or the substantive requirement of  Table  4(d)(iii)  that  the
      applicant must be in an occupation at a particular SOC level.



  28. In our view, on the evidence before her, had she considered the issue,
      the Judge could not but have concluded that that the Respondent  could
      not satisfy that requirement.  There was no evidence here  upon  which
      the judge could properly find that the Respondent  had  an  occupation
      falling within SOC Code 1132 or  any  occupation  falling  within  NQF
      Level 4 or above; and no evidence upon which a finding could  be  made
      that, in the future, the business would likely be of such a  size  and
      standing that it would require a marketing and sales manager doing the
      sorts of things set out in the example tasks set out in SOC code  1132
      or in any job at NQF level 4 or higher, at a  level  of  job  function
      envisaged in those levels of the NQF  scheme.   Indeed,  the  evidence
      falls very far short of arguably showing that requirement to have been
      satisfied.



Ground 2



  29. It was submitted by Mr Deller that, in the evidence submitted with the
      application, the Respondent had failed to satisfy two of the  specific
      requirements in the Rules,  namely  (i)  a  letter  from  a  financial
      institution holding the relevant funds confirming the amount available
      to the applicant, and (ii) a contract  incorporating  the  applicant's
      name, the evidential flexibility policy having no application.



  30. Given our conclusion on Ground 1 -  which  is  determinative  of  this
      appeal and the appropriate disposal - we need not deal with Ground  2.
      In the circumstances, we would merely make  reference  to  the  recent
      illuminating decision of Secretary of State for the Home Department  v
      Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2, which emphasises that,  where  the  Rules
      impose  a  mandatory  requirement  for  a  specified  document  to  be
      submitted with an application for leave - on the basis that, if it  is
      not produced, then  the  application  will  be  refused  -  given  the
      importance of consistency and predictability in this area, there is no
      scope for imposing an obligation on the Secretary of State to  enquire
      after documents if they are not submitted.  Consequently, although the
      crucial and determinative issue in this case is (and ,  in  our  view,
      always  was)  whether  the  Respondent  applicant  had  satisfied  the
      substantive requirement of Table 4(d)(iii), it should not  be  thought
      that we consider the issues raised by Mr Deller as  to  the  specified
      evidence requirements of paragraph 42SD of Appendix A were necessarily
      without merit.  In respect of them, we simply make no findings.



Decision



30.  For the reasons we have given, we consider the Immigration Judge  erred
     in law; and her decision is set aside.  It is remade as follows:   the
     Secretary of State's appeal is allowed, and  the  Respondent's  appeal
     against the decision of the Secretary of State's is dismissed.
