For the Respondent:    Mr S Khan,  Counsel  instructed  by  Messrs  Malik  &
Malik Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant (hereinafter  called  the  Secretary
    of State) against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Wiseman,
    who sitting at Richmond on 14  October  2014  and  in  a  determination
    subsequently promulgated on 13 November 2014 allowed the appeal of  the
    Respondent (hereinafter called the claimant) a citizen  of  Afghanistan
    born on 2 May 1981, against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    dated 28 May 2014 to make a deportation order against the  claimant  by
    virtue of Section 32(5) of the United Kingdom Borders Act 2007.

Background

2.   On 11 July 2011 the claimant was  convicted  at  the  Central  Criminal
    Court on two counts of making false representations to make a gain  for
    himself or another or to cause loss to another/expose another to  risk,
    for which he received a sentence of 32  months'  imprisonment  on  each
    count to be served concurrently.

3.   This was not the first time that the claimant  had  been  convicted  of
    criminal offences.  Indeed, on 22 February 2010, he  was  convicted  at
    Isleworth Crown Court inter alia, of the same offence for which he  was
    fined �1,515 and in relation to which there was a victim  surcharge  of
    �15 and the claimant was also ordered to pay compensation in the sum of
    �630.

4.   At the same  hearing,  for  failing  to  surrender  to  custody  at  an
    appointed time, the claimant was sentenced to a community order  of  80
    hours' unpaid work.

5.   The claimant was also convicted on  30  September  2004  of  driving  a
    motor vehicle with excess alcohol and  no  insurance,  in  relation  to
    which he was disqualified from driving from twelve months and fined.

6.   The brief immigration history of the claimant is otherwise that he  was
    granted exceptional leave to remain on 28 October 2005.  On 26  January
    2006, the claimant was granted a No Time Limit leave to remain.

7.   Following the claimant's marriage on 11 March  2006,  he  submitted  an
    application for naturalisation that was refused on  12  February  2008.
    On 19 February 2008 the claimant's son was born.  A further application
    for naturalisation was refused on 17 July 2009.  On 19  September  2009
    the claimant's second son was born.  Both children respectively aged  7
    and 5 years at the time  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  are
    British citizens.  The claimant's wife, born on 1 January  1985  gained
    British citizenship on 15 August  2012  and  has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

8.   On 4 November 2011, a Notice of Liability to  Deportation  was  issued.
    On 9 December 2012, the claimant was detained under Home Office  powers
    following his release from prison.  On 13 December 2012,  the  claimant
    submitted a bail application subsequently granted on 19 December  2012.
    On 17 December 2012 a request for temporary admission was declined.

9.   In his determination, the First-tier Judge noted that the Secretary  of
    State accepted that the claimant had a genuine subsisting  relationship
    with each of his two children but  it  was  considered  in  their  best
    interests to remain in the UK where they would  be  cared  for  by  the
    claimant's wife.  It was also noted that the  Respondent  had  observed
    that at the time of her decision the claimant  was  33  years  old  and
    after discounting the period of time that he had spent in  prison,  the
    claimant had resided in the United  Kingdom  for  approximately  twelve
    years having spent the first eighteen years of his life in Afghanistan.
     It was not considered by the Respondent to  be  unreasonable  to  thus
    expect the claimant to be able to reintegrate  himself  in  Afghanistan
    where he still had family.

10.  It was noted by the Judge that the Respondent did  not  consider  there
    to be any exceptional circumstances  that  would  outweigh  the  public
    interest in the claimant being deported,  notwithstanding  the  medical
    condition of the claimant's youngest son,  in  relation  to  which  the
    Respondent noted that a medical report of 14 October 2014  stated  that
    although the claimant's son had what was described as a slight delay in
    cognitive skills, he was making good developmental  progress.   Further
    and in any event the claimant's wife  had  maintained  the  appropriate
    level of care for their youngest son whilst the claimant was in  prison
    and would continue to do so.

11.  The refusal letter made no  mention  of  a  third  child  born  to  the
    claimant and his wife, but the determination at paragraph 32 does refer
    to three children and at paragraph 47 through the Presenting  Officer's
    submission that the claimant and his wife "had deliberately had a third
    child, even though he  must  have  been  well  aware  of  the  risk  of
    deportation at the time; he should not be allowed to create a situation
    in this way to lead to him being able to avoid deportation; his  appeal
    should be dismissed".

12.  At paragraph 59 of his determination the Judge appreciated that he  had
    to consider in particular the  provisions  of  paragraph  117C  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  as  implemented  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014.

13.  The First-tier Judge proceeded to conclude there was no doubt that  the
    situation in Afghanistan  upon  his  consideration  of  the  background
    material and relevant country guidance case law, was that the situation
    in Afghanistan  was  such  that  it  would  be  "a  wholly  unrealistic
    proposition in the circumstances to  suggest  that  the  family  should
    travel back to Afghanistan" and the Judge recognised in  fairness  that
    the Respondent did not suggest to the contrary.

14.  In that regard at paragraph 60 of his determination the Judge had  this
    to say:

         "There are perhaps two separate points to make at this  stage;  the
         first is that the refusal letter itself concedes that the  starting
         point should be that the British wife and children will  remain  in
         the United Kingdom and that it would be unreasonable to expect them
         to leave.  That is a very sensible concession (particularly bearing
         in mind the health issues relating to D) and at least  reduces  the
         number of other matters that have to be considered.  Of  course  in
         theory  any  family  could  travel  together  in  order  to  remain
         together, but it is sensible for the case to be dealt with  on  the
         basis that it is unreasonable to require it.  As a matter of record
         of course I think the Appellant  himself  is  only  not  a  British
         citizen now because he had committed a significant motoring offence
         quite a number of years ago and he was  excluded  when  the  family
         were gaining that citizenship".

15.  At paragraph 65 the Judge pointed out that:

         "There is no such thing as a victimless crime and I have  no  doubt
         that these frauds caused problems for many people and  particularly
         if there were individuals who  actually  had  their  genuine  cards
         misused.  Even if that was not the case, someone must have lost out
         substantially during the course of all this criminal activity which
         was of course being carried out for the financial advantage of some
         individuals even if not the Appellant".

    Moreover in particular at paragraphs 70 to 72 of his determination  the
    Judge reasoned as to why he had  concluded  that  the  removal  of  the
    claimant would be disproportionate and in that regard although he  made
    no specific reference to it it is clear that the Judge had in mind  the
    Exception  provisions  as  set  out  over  Sections  117C(4)  and   (5)
    respectively.

The Legal Framework

16.  On 28 July 2014, Section 19 of the Immigration  Act  2014  was  brought
    into force that amended the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 by introducing a new Part 5A that contains  Sections  117A,  117B,
    117C and 117D.

17.  For the  purposes  of  this  case  and  the  challenge  raised  by  the
    Secretary of State, it would be as well to refer to the  provisions  of
    Section 117C that is headed "Article  8  additional  considerations  in
    cases involving foreign criminals".

18.  The Section states that the deportation of foreign criminals is (1)  in
    the public interest; (2) the more serious the offence  committed  by  a
    foreign criminal the greater is the public interest in deportation; (3)
    that in the case of a foreign criminal who has not been sentenced to  a
    period of imprisonment of four  years  or  more,  the  public  interest
    requires the foreign  criminal's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
    Exception 2 applies.

19.  It is in relation to those Exceptions,  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    maintains that the First-tier Judge materially erred in law.

20.  117(4) explains that Exception 1 applies where-

    (a)  the foreign criminal has been lawfully resident in the UK for most
         of his life,


    (b)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK, and


    (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to his integration  into
         the country to which it is proposed that he is to be deported.

21.  Section 117C(5) explains that Exception 2  applies  where  the  foreign
    criminal has  a  genuine  subsisting  relationship  with  a  qualifying
    partner, or a genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    qualifying child,  and  that  the  effect  of  the  foreign  criminal's
    deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

22.  A "qualifying partner" means a partner who was  a  British  citizen  or
    settled in the UK within the meaning of the Immigration Act 2014.

23.  A "qualifying child" means a person who is  under  18  and  who  was  a
    British citizen or resident in the  United  Kingdom  for  a  continuous
    period of seven years or more.

24.  Part 13 of the Immigration Rules  (deportation)  had  been  amended  to
    reflect these provisions that  are  tightened  up  as  to  when  it  is
    reasonable to expect a child to leave the UK or to be separated from  a
    foreign criminal who has a  parental  relationship.   It  is  thus  for
    Judges to decide  whether  there  are  exceptional  reasons  warranting
    departure from the Immigration Rules.  Where there are, then the  Judge
    will have to consider the public interest question.  That includes  the
    factors listed in Sections 117B and 117C.

25.  Public interest considerations are set out  at  Section  117B  and  are
    applicable in all cases.  Such considerations include the fact that the
    maintenance of effective immigration control is in the public interest.

The Proceedings

26.  The Secretary of State successfully obtained permission to  appeal  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision, the grounds of which  in  summary  took
    issue with the First-tier Judge's reasoning in  terms  of  Exception  1
    under s.117C(4) and  Exception  2  under  s.117C(5).   It  was  further
    contended that the Judge was in error in concluding that the claimant's
    circumstances were sufficient to outweigh the public interest in favour
    of deportation.

27.  In granting permission to  appeal  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Brunnen
    considered inter alia that the Judge implicitly found at  paragraph  68
    of his determination that the claimant did not fall within Exception  1
    in s.117C(4) and  made  no  findings  as  to  whether  Exception  2  in
    s.117C(5) applied.  It was thus arguable that the Judge's  approach  to
    the appeal was in error and/or that  he  failed  to  give  sufficiently
    clear reasons for his decision.

28.  Thus the appeal came before us on 21 January 2015 when our  first  task
    was to decide whether  or  not  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge contained an error or errors on a point of law  such  as
    may have materially affected the outcome of the appeal.

29.  Having considered the parties' submissions with care we  were  able  to
    inform them that  we  did  not  consider  that  the  previous  decision
    involved the making of an error on a  point  of  law  material  to  the
    outcome of the appeal and that we would order that it should stand.  We
    shall now give our reasons for so finding.

Assessment

30.  It became readily apparent at the outset of the hearing that there  was
    common ground between us and the parties that the safety of the  First-
    tier Tribunal determination was predicated on whether it  was  open  to
    the First-tier Judge to find for the claimant under the  provisions  of
    Exception 2 in s.117C(5).

31.  It was indeed apparent to us, with due respect to the First-tier  Judge
    who granted permission to appeal, that contrary to  his  understanding,
    the Judge did make findings as to whether Exception 2  applied  in  the
    particular circumstances of this case,  over paragraphs 70 to 72 of the
    determination. Further, that whilst the Judge  did  not  make  specific
    reference to the provisions of paragraph 399 of the  Immigration  Rules
    that they were essentially reflected within the provisions of Exception
    2.

32.  It would be as well therefore to set out below what the  Judge  had  to
    say over paragraph 70 to 72 as follows

         "70. (The claimant) does appear from the  lengthy  reports  I  have
             read to play a very significant role in the life of his family
             and in particular with D.  The double requirement to  look  at
             now under the new wording of  the  Immigration  Rules  is  'it
             would be unduly harsh for the partner  to  remain  in  the  UK
             without the person who is to  be  deported'  and  whether  'it
             would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to  remain  in  the  UK
             without the person who is to be deported' (Our emphasis).


         71.  I think one only really has to read the key  reports  to  form
             the view that both these situations would be  'unduly  harsh'.
             I have to say that the refusal letter grossly understates  the
             nature of the illness from which D suffers  and  almost  gives
             the impression that he is simply receiving  medication  for  a
             condition that causes little problems.  However, it  is  clear
             that Sturge-Weber syndrome is a serious neurological  disorder
             in  children  involving  certainly  developmental  delays  and
             mental retardation.  It does not appear to be curable and  can
             lead to further problems as a child gets older.  To sum up the
             reports  as  suggesting  that  'he  is  progressing  well  and
             improving as he matures' would  be  a  bold  assessment  by  a
             medical specialist but is almost meaningless  coming  from  an
             immigration caseworker.


         72.  There are many  pages  of  reports  that  cannot  sensibly  be
             summarised but I have no difficulty in finding that  it  would
             be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK without  the
             Appellant and indeed unduly harsh for his  wife  who  has  two
             other children to look after including a young baby.  Although
             she does have support from her in-laws  at  the  moment,  that
             cannot in any way replace the presence of the father of  three
             young children and in any event an unreasonable obligation  to
             place upon third parties in anything other than the short term
             as they might seek their own accommodation  and  have  further
             family commitments themselves".

33.  We did indeed together with the parties' representatives, consider  the
    plethora of medical reports  and  assessments,  within  the  claimant's
    bundle that were before the First-tier Judge from which it was apparent
    that as we find, it was properly open to him to  conclude  having  read
    the "key reports", to form the view that in applying the provisions  of
    paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules and  those  within  Exception  2
    under s.117C(5), against the backdrop of the facts as found,  it  would
    be unduly harsh for the children not least  D,  to  remain  in  the  UK
    without the claimant and unduly harsh for the claimant's wife to remain
    in the UK without him.  Such was of course  reflected  in  the  Judge's
    concluding remarks in this regard at paragraph 72 of his  determination
    (above).

34.  Mr Tarlow took issue with the Judge's  finding  at  paragraph  71  that
    "Sturge-Weber  syndrome  (was)  a  serious  neurological  disorder   in
    children  involving   certainly   developmental   delays   and   mental
    retardation". Indeed, our careful consideration of the medical evidence
    that was before the First-tier Judge, does not suggest that  such,  was
    specifically stated within them.  It is however  clear  to  us,  as  no
    doubt it was to the First-tier  Judge,  that  when  one  looks  at  the
    reports overall, it is self-evident that D is  very  clearly  a  person
    suffering not least from significant learning  difficulties,  cognitive
    development, language skills and physical balance as well  as  seizures
    such as to demonstrate, as indeed the First-tier Judge concluded,  that
    the  claimant's  son  D,  was  clearly  suffering   from   a   "serious
    neurological disorder ...".  We find  therefore  that  looking  at  the
    medical evidence holistically, it was open to the First-tier  Judge  to
    reach that conclusion.

35.  It is apparent that the seriousness  of  D's  condition  is  not  least
    reflected in the involvement of the sheer  number  of  medical  experts
    involved in his care and  continual  assessment.   We  note  that  this
    includes  in  no  particular  order,  a  Consultant  Opthalmologist,  a
    Consultant Paediatric  Neurologist,  a  Clinical  Nurse  Specialist,  a
    Clinical   Psychologist,   a   Speech   and   Language   Therapist,   a
    Physiotherapist and Trainee Clinical Psychologist as well as of  course
    the claimant's son's GP.

36.  Notably, Mr Tarlow informed us, whilst he relied on the grounds  before
    us and was not in a position to concede the appeal, his formal position
    was that the Judge's findings  at  paragraph  70  to  72  (above)  were
    unsustainable.  Mr Tarlow concluded "I say no more than that".

37.    It is also right to say that there was common ground between  us  and
    the parties, that the Judge was in error of law  in  concluding  within
    his determination that Exception (1) under Section 117C (4) applied  in
    this case in that as Mr Khan conceded, it could not be reasonably said,
    without more, that in light of the claimant's criminal convictions, the
    criteria under (b), that the  claimant  was  "socially  and  culturally
    integrated in the UK" could possibly be met.  In that  regard  and  for
    the sake of completeness we point out that the criteria at (a)  to  (c)
    that are required to be met in order for Exception 1  to  be  found  to
    apply, are cumulative and thus a failure  to  meet  any  one  of  those
    criteria will effectively be fatal to its compliance.

38.  Thus we find that the Judge's  conclusion  that  the  claimant  was  so
    integrated was not only unsustainable but indeed  was  lacking  in  any
    adequate explanation for that conclusion.

39.  Further we find there to have been no or  no  adequate  explanation  or
    consideration to satisfactorily demonstrate  that  the  claimant  would
    meet "very significant obstacles" to his reintegration into Afghanistan
    in circumstances where he would be returning as a single man and  where
    he continued to have family. To that extent  we  thus  agree  with  the
    Secretary of  State's  criticisms  of  the  determination.   The  issue
    however, for us is whether that error of law was material.

40.  It was as we have found, properly open to the Judge to conclude on  the
    application  of  the  facts  as  found  that  the  claimant   met   the
    requirements of Exception 2.  It was apparent to  the  Judge  that  the
    claimant took an active role in the care of the children  and  although
    it was observed by the Secretary of State in her refusal  letter,  that
    the claimant's wife appeared to have coped whilst the claimant  was  in
    prison, that of course was before the extra dimension of a third  child
    having been born to  the  couple  since  the  claimant's  release  from
    prison.

  42.   Whilst  we  appreciate  that  exceptional  circumstances  are   fact
    sensitive and whilst it may be that a Tribunal differently  constituted
    might have reached a different decision from the  First-tier  Judge  in
    this case,  we  are  nonetheless  and  for  the  above  reasons,  quite
    satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Judge applied the proper test in
    terms of Exception 2  under  Section  117C(5)  and  that  it  was  thus
    properly  open  to  him  to  conclude  that  there   were   exceptional
    circumstances  both  under  that  Section  and  under  the   equivalent
    Immigration Rule.

43.  It is also apparent to us as reflected not least  at  paragraph  65  of
    the Judge's determination to which we have above referred, that he  was
    properly mindful of the public interest in the balanced  approach  that
    he took in the particular circumstances of this case as found.

44.   The public interest requires a foreign criminal's  deportation  unless
    Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies and  in  this  case  the  First-tier
    Judge, for reasons supported  by  and  open  to  him  on  the  evidence
    concluded that the criteria within Exception 2 were in the case of this
    claimant, properly met. Such a finding was thus and as we  have  found,
    sustainable in law.

45.  Therefore, although there was an error of law  in  this  case  and  the
    Secretary of State was as we find,  perfectly  entitled  to  bring  the
    appeal as she did, we are equally satisfied that the decision  was  not
    affected by that error of law and therefore we dismiss the Secretary of
    State's appeal.




Decision

The making of the previous decision involved the making of  no  error  on  a
point of law material to the outcome of the appeal and  we  therefore  order
that it shall stand.
