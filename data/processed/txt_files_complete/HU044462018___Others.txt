Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms P Solanki, Counsel instructed by Law & Co
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J McGirr, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are nationals  of  Pakistan  and  a  family.  The  first
    Appellant first entered the UK on 25 June 2006 with leave to enter as a
    student.  That leave was subsequently extended and varied to that of  a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant and then to a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  On
    26 June 2016, he made an application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    with his wife and two children as his dependants.  That application was
    refused by the Respondent in a decision dated 26 January  2018  against
    which he appealed.  His appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal  for
    hearing on 13 July 2018 in  Birmingham.   In  a  decision  and  reasons
    promulgated  on  2  August  2018  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grimmett
    dismissed his appeal.

 2. Permission to appeal was sought to the Upper Tribunal on the  following
    bases: firstly, that at [13] the judge had  reached  conclusions  which
    were either irrational or inadequately reasoned on the basis that there
    was a discrepancy  between  the  profits  claimed  of  �50,844  in  the
    application for further leave  made  in  September  2013  and  the  tax
    returns for the period which the judge found covered a two year  period
    of 2012 to 2014 and amounted to �48,160.  It was submitted that in fact
    the  Appellant's  profit  over  that  period  was  based  on  the   tax
    calculation of �57,411 and that  this  was  an  amount  that  had  been
    declared to HMRC; secondly, the judge erred in conflating at  [19]  the
    accountants who prepared the 2012 to 2013 accounts whom  the  Appellant
    had been able to contact for an explanation and the accountants who had
    prepared the 2011 to 2012 accounts and the judge repeated this error at
    [22]; thirdly, that the judge had misinterpreted  legal  rules  on  the
    complex analysis of accounting methods on which the evidence was  based
    and further failed  to  state  in  a  decision  notice  the  method  of
    reasoning followed to arrive at her decision and  the  judge  erred  in
    concluding that she did not believe that there were  previous  accounts
    in light of the factors at G1 of the  Home  Office  appeal  bundle  and
    where there is reference to a letter from HMRC to  Premier  Accountants
    and Tax Advisers.

 3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lambert in a decision and reasons dated 16 October 2018.



     Hearing

 4. When the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal for hearing, Ms  Solanki
    on behalf of the Appellants sought to rely on a skeleton argument.  She
    submitted that there  were  three  errors  contained  in  [13]  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, which provides as follows:

         "I am satisfied that the Respondent has shown grounds  for  concern
         about the tax returns.  The Appellant claimed a profit  of  �50,844
         from PAYE and self-employment just  over  the  figure  required  to
         allow the Appellant leave to remain for the  tax  year  11  October
         2012 to 9 September 2013 when he sought leave to remain.   However,
         his gross income declared to HMRC for the two years from April 2012
         to April 2014 was only �48,160."

 5. Ms Solanki submitted that the first error is that the judge had got the
    material dates wrong and the point taken by the Respondent  related  to
    the tax year 12 September 2009 to 11  September  2010  rather  than  11
    October 2012 to 9 September 2013.  This  was  because  when  making  an
    application  for  further  leave  to  remain  UKVI  require  that   the
    application is based on earnings within the previous twelve months.  Ms
    Solanki indicated that the profit declared to HMRC from  a  combination
    of the Appellant's PAYE and self-employment was �57,954.55.  The second
    error made by the judge was in stating that the gross  income  declared
    to HMRC for the two years from April 2012 to April 2014 was �48,160 and
    the third error was claiming that the profit claimed i.e.  �50,844  was
    just over the threshold for making an application for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 Migrant whereas when calculated correctly the profit figure
    was  �57,954.55  which  was  well  over   the   upper   threshold   for
    qualification of �55,000.

 6. Ms Solanki submitted the judge had further erred at [19] to [20]  which
    provide as follows:

         "19. In his oral evidence the Appellant said he could not  remember
             the name of the original accountants.  He did  not  meet  them
             and  never  had  any  contact  with  them  they  were   simply
             recommended by his immigration consultant who dealt  with  all
             matters for him.   There  is  a  letter  from  TaxLounge,  the
             Appellant's current advisers dated  1  February  2016,  saying
             they have written to the Appellant's  old  accountants  asking
             for an explanation  about  the  incorrect  tax  returns.   The
             Appellant does not explain how his accountants have managed to
             do that when he says it is not possible for him obtain the tax
             returns completed by the original accountants because he never
             met them and did not know their name or address.

         20.  There is a letter at page 147A from  the  current  accountants
             saying they have concluded that the Appellant's tax return for
             2012 to 2013 was submitted on 31  January  2014  and  thus  on
             time.  Their client realised there was an error and  told  his
             accountants and that he was then emailed a copy of the amended
             return and advised to pay �600 to bring his account  to  date.
             However,  the  amended  return  was  not  submitted   by   the
             accountants for reasons unknown but  the  appellant  paid  the
             �600 on 21 March  2014.   There  is  no  mention  of  who  the
             accountants were or how TaxLounge arrived  at  the  conclusion
             they did."

 7. Ms Solanki drew my attention to letters written by TaxLounge  at  pages
    147 to 150 of the Appellant's bundle.  She acknowledged that  TaxLounge
    do not name the accountants to whom they have written, however, at page
    110 of the Appellant's bundle is a letter from the previous accountants
    and a set of management accounts.  This firm of  accountants  who  were
    representing  the  Appellant  in  2013  are  the  Accountancy  Advisory
    Service.

 8. At [22] the judge held as follows:

         "22. I was not satisfied that the Appellant was telling the  truth.
             There is no evidence to show the previous  accountants  exist.
             There is no evidence to show he had  an  immigration  advisor.
             He has not explained how he could  have  believed  he  had  an
             income of over �50,000 in a 12-month period  when  it  was  in
             reality,  according  to  the  information  he  gave   to   the
             respondent, his income was less than �20,000  per  annum.   He
             said his accounts were amended long before his application for
             leave to remain was made but that application was lodged on 16
             June 2016 and HMRC received the outstanding  tax  on  7  March
             2016."

 9. Ms Solanki submitted that there were further errors in this  paragraph:
    firstly, in respect of the judge's finding that there was  no  evidence
    that the previous accountants exist, this was contrary to the  evidence
    in the Respondent's bundle at G1 which is a letter from HMRC  dated  18
    November 2013 stating that a copy  of  the  notice  had  seen  sent  to
    Premier Accountants and Tax Advisers.  Therefore, they clearly  existed
    and clearly acted for the Appellant.  Secondly, the Appellant has never
    said to the Respondent that his income was less than �20,000 per annum,
    this is simply wrong.  Thirdly, the  judge  erred  in  respect  of  her
    understanding of the dates as to when the amendments to the Appellant's
    tax return were made.  There is no dispute that the  Appellant  amended
    his tax return in November 2013 and what the judge is referring  to  is
    to the final date when the  Appellant  paid  his  tax  according  to  a
    payment plan, thus the last payment was made  on  7  March  2016.   The
    Appellant's application for indefinite leave to remain was made  on  16
    June 2016, three months after the final payment in the payment plan had
    been made and that payment plan having been  arranged  far  in  advance
    with HMRC.

10. Ms Solanki further submitted that the judge had failed to determine the
    issues that she was asked to do.  Given that paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Rules is a discretionary basis of refusal, it is clear  from  the  Home
    Office guidance that it was not envisaged it would be used  in  such  a
    case as this given that it was  generally  it  was  used  for  eg.  war
    crimes, because the test is whether it is  undesirable  to  expect  the
    person to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.   It  is  clear  from  the
    jurisprudence eg. Ngouh [2010] EWHC 2218 (Admin) that the threshold  is
    a high one and that positive and negative factors have to be  balanced.
    Ms Solanki submitted there was nothing in the Tribunal's decision  that
    indicated any form of balancing exercise had been carried out.  On  the
    contrary the  judge  stated  simply  at  [23]:  "I  was  not  satisfied
    therefore the discrepancies  in  the  figures  come  from  an  innocent
    mistake.  I am satisfied that the Appellant has sought to  mislead  the
    Respondent and his application fails on grounds of suitability."

11. Ms Solanki set out in her skeleton argument  a  detailed  list  of  the
    material factors which are as follows:

      a) The Appellant's tax returns from 2010 to 2013 have been amended  in
         2013, long before any ILR application was made.

      b) The Appellant was at no stage prompted to make amendments by HMRC;

      c) The Appellant's  tax  returns  from  2013  onwards  have  not  been
         criticised at all.  The Respondent  is  supposed  to  look  at  the
         matter on the balance of probabilities.

      d) The Appellant has paid his tax in full.

      e) The Appellant pays  accountants  to  deal  with  his  tax  affairs.
         Whilst the Appellant has a responsibility to check his tax  affairs
         one would expect an accountant to deal with the same diligently and
         responsibly.  At the time the Appellant was new to  self-employment
         and his income was also  split  over  two  accounting  years.   The
         Appellant had no reason to suspect his accountants and  was  paying
         them to provide a service.

      f) The Appellant has had  a  complex  employment  situation  balancing
         employment and self-employment.  The Appellant's  accountants  also
         made errors in reporting employment income despite having access to
         payslips and P60s.

      g) The Appellant states he was stressed and  going  through  difficult
         times with his family.

      h) The Respondent has  not  had  regard  to  the  relevant  accounting
         periods and had not  sought  to  consider  the  Appellant's  income
         against this and the different periods  required  for  applications
         for leave to remain.  It is evident the Respondent  has  not  found
         any actual discrepancy.

      i) The  Respondent  failed  to  consider  that  the  Appellant  is  an
         individual who has always resided in the UK with leave to remain.

      j) The Appellant has complied with the terms of his  visas  completing
         his relevant studies and working as permitted.

      k) There is no suggestion by the Respondent  that  his  employment  or
         self-employment were anything less than genuine.

      l) There is no history of the Appellant ever having used deception.

      m) The Appellant has been in the  UK  lawfully  and  continuously  for
         twelve years.

      n) The Appellant's character is exemplary and this was attested to  by
         friends, colleagues and employers.

      o) The Appellant resides in the UK with his wife and two children  who
         are in  settled  education.   There  was  no  regard  to  the  best
         interests of his minor children when considering paragraph 322(5).

      p) Even if the Appellant made errors that were not  innocent  in  some
         way  many  years  ago,  the  question  remains  whether  that   was
         sufficient to make out the high  threshold  reached  for  paragraph
         322(5) and the discretionary basis of refusal.

12. Ms Solanki further submitted that consideration had to be given to  the
    fact that HMRC did not impose a penalty on  the  Appellant  but  simply
    interest for the late payment and that this is clear from pages  24  to
    26 of the Appellant's bundle.

13. In his submission Mr McGirr asserted looking at  [13]  of  the  judge's
    decision, that it was unclear where the figures there  had  come  from,
    but looking at the Appellant's bundle it was  also  unclear  where  the
    Appellant's figures have come from.  At page  108  this  sets  out  the
    SA302 in respect of the Appellant's PAYE income for  2012  to  2013  of
    �17,561 and at page 145 his PAYE income for 2013 to  2014  of  �39,850.
    He submitted it was unclear what other evidence had  been  provided  by
    the Appellant to the Tribunal in order to show his income and  that  it
    may be that he did not meet the financial threshold for the application
    based on his income for 2011 to 2012.  Thus, his  submission  was  that
    the judge may have been right but for  the  wrong  reason.   Mr  McGirr
    submitted that a similar lack of clarity arises at  [19]  and  [20]  in
    respect of the Appellant's former accountants.  The judge  makes  clear
    that her finding is based on the oral evidence of the Appellant at  the
    hearing and that may explain the confusion that has arisen.

14. In relation to the fact that HMRC did  not  take  any  punitive  action
    against the  Appellant,  he  submitted  that  the  way  one  government
    department conducts business may  not  be  the  way  that  business  is
    conducted by  other  government  departments  and  that  this  was  not
    significant.  Mr McGirr submitted that although the judge's figures are
    confusing in part this does not mean that the judge's  conclusions  are
    wrong.  He submitted it was telling that the judge found there  was  no
    evidence to show that there was an immigration adviser who was a  fall-
    back guy for the Appellant, nor that he had an income of  over  �50,000
    in the twelve month period when the evidence before the judge showed  a
    PAYE figure of less than this and there was no oral  evidence  to  show
    that the figure was as high as the Appellant maintained.  He  submitted
    on the basis of the facts regarding the  Appellant's  declared  income,
    the judge was quite entitled to raise the suspicions that she  did  and
    not to have regard to any action HMRC took and to consider  whether  or
    not there was an innocent explanation for this given that the Appellant
    was in a position to give evidence to provide an  innocent  explanation
    and failed to do so.  He asked that the judge's decision be  maintained
    and the appeal dismissed.

15.  In  reply,  Ms  Solanki  submitted  that   Mr   McGirr's   submissions
    demonstrated how easy it was to fall into error.  Looking at  page  108
    of the Appellant's bundle, contrary to his submission,  this  does  not
    show �17,561 for PAYE but �17,561 for everything.  At page 145 there is
    reference to �17,385 for his employment and �22,465 for self-employment
    which in total made up �39,850 for the April 2013  to  April  2014  tax
    year.  She submitted that both these tax calculations were  before  the
    judge at pages 94 to 107 and 129 to  146  of  the  Appellant's  bundle.
    These  also  show  his  expenses  and  his  P60s  in  relation  to  his
    employment.

16. In respect of the submission that the Judge's findings at [19] and [20]
    in respect of the Appellant's former  accountants  were  based  on  the
    Appellant's oral evidence, it is clear from his  witness  statement  at
    page 29 of the bundle, [19] that he declared a total income of  �50,844
    and that his new  tax  return  was  submitted  by  Accounting  Advisory
    Services, who were the second accountants.  Ms Solanki  submitted  that
    the letters from TaxLounge were very clear: these are at page  147  and
    are referring to the 2012 to 2013 tax return submitted in January  2014
    and that they had assisted in making amendments.

17. In respect of the issue of government bodies acting inconsistently,  Ms
    Solanki sought to rely on the judgment in Bapio Action Ltd and  Another
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 1139 where
    the court found that when one government body acts in a particular  way
    that is informative in respect of any other government body cf. [25] of
    her skeleton argument.

     Decision and Reasons

18. I find material errors of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Grimmett for the  reasons  set  out  in  the  grounds  of  appeal
    expanded upon by Ms Solanki in her skeleton  argument  of  27  November
    2018 and in her oral submissions.  It is apparent that  the  judge  was
    confused both  by  the  differing  figures  for  employment  and  self-
    employment and the distinction between profit and tax liability.   This
    was, in part, based on the  fact  that  in  the  refusal  decision  the
    Respondent made errors in relation to the Appellant's income. The basis
    of the refusal was that there was a discrepancy between the tax paid in
    relation to the 2009/2010  income,  albeit  in  light  of  the  amended
    calculation in November 2013 his earnings declared to HMRC were brought
    more in line with those to UKVI.

19. I find that it is crucial for a proper  determination  of  this  appeal
    that the details and clear analysis  of  the  tax  paid  vis-�-vis  the
    income declared for the purposes of making an application to  UKVI  are
    set out and findings based on the correct figures.  I further find that
    the judge  fell  into  error  at  [19]  to  [22]  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's accountants. Whilst it  would  have  been  helpful  if  the
    Appellant's current accountants,  TaxLounge,  had  indicated  in  their
    letter at page  147  of  the  Appellant's  bundle,  to  which  firm  of
    accountants they were referring, when this  letter  is  read  with  the
    letter at page 110 from the Accountancy Advisory Service, it  is  clear
    that that is the firm to whom  they  are  referring.  Consequently  the
    judge failed to take into account material evidence viz the letter from
    Accountancy Advisory Service at page 110 of the Appellant's bundle.

20. I further find the judge erred materially in her assessment of the date
    when the Appellant made his tax amendments, it not  being  disputed  by
    the Respondent and indeed contained in the refusal  decision  which  is
    recorded by the judge at [5] of her decision, that the  tax  amendments
    were made in November 2013,  whereas  his  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain was not made until June 2016.

21. I further find there is merit in the submission that the judge did  not
    set out and analyse all the factors that  required  consideration  when
    considering overall whether  the  Respondent  had  acted  correctly  in
    refusing the application with reference to  322(5)  of  the  Rules  and
    failed to take into consideration the fact that HMRC did not  impose  a
    penalty on the Appellant  but  simply  charged  him  interest  for  the
    outstanding amount of tax.





22.  For  these  reasons  and  given  that  the  Appellant's  evidence  and
    credibility was not accepted by the judge, I set aside the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge and remit the appeal  for  a  hearing  de
    novo.
