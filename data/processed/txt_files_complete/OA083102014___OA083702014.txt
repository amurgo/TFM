Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Khan (Solicitor, Anwar Law Associates)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants applied to enter the  UK  to  join  their  parents,  the
    application was made under paragraph 301 of the Immigration Rules.  The
    applications were refused by the ECO in a Refusal Notice of the 25th of
    May 2014. A  number  of  reasons  were  given  for  not  accepting  the
    financial  evidence  supplied  including  a  reference  to  a  document
    verification report (DVR).

 2. The appeals were heard by Judge S J Pacey at Nottingham on the 11th  of
    September 2015. Following criticism of  the  ECO  for  the  failure  to
    comply with directions for the service of documentation, including  the
    failure to provide the DVR, the Judge made positive findings in respect
    of the financial evidence provided. The Judge was  satisfied  that  the
    Sponsor earned more than �20,406.26, the figure given  in  the  Refusal
    Notice as being the minimum he would need to show to satisfy  paragraph
    301.

 3. The appeals were dismissed because the Judge found that  the  documents
    provided by the Appellants did not meet the requirements of paragraph 7
    of Appendix FM-SE in respect of annual audited accounts and the absence
    of an accountant's certificate.

 4. The Appellants appealed on the basis that this had not been  raised  by
    the Judge at the hearing and the representatives should have been given
    the opportunity to deal with the point. Permission was granted by Judge
    Dineen on the 27th of June 2016 and the matter heard in Field House  as
    indicated.

 5. As a side issue it is not necessarily an error of law for  a  Judge  to
    take a point that they notice when reading the papers  after  the  oral
    hearing has taken place.  If  a  party  is  represented  the  Judge  is
    entitled to take it that the representatives are aware of the  contents
    of the papers  that  they  have  submitted  and  to  be  aware  of  the
    requirements that they have to meet. With so much of the evidence being
    taken as read it is not realistic to expect  a  Judge  to  raise  every
    point that arises at the hearing.

 6. The error in this appeal is that Appendix FM-SE did not apply  to  this
    case. Paragraph A277 at the start of Part 8 of the Immigration Rules is
    to the effect that Appendix FM applies to all applications unless where
    the provisions of part 8 are preserved. By paragraph A280(f)  paragraph
    301 applies without additional requirements  to  an  application  by  a
    child of a person granted leave to enter or remain before  the  9th  of
    July 2012. By virtue of  the  Sponsor's  position  only  paragraph  301
    applies in this case.

 7. The focus of the appeal was  solely  on  whether  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 301 had been met at the  date  of  the  decision.  The  clear
    findings  made  by  the  Judge  are  that  the  Appellants  met   those
    requirements and having found that the earnings of the Sponsor exceeded
    the Income Support threshold, as set out in  the  Refusal  Notice,  the
    appeal should have been allowed at that point.

 8. I note that there is no cross-appeal by the Secretary of State  so  the
    Judge's  findings  on  the  ability  of  the  Appellants  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 301 in respect of finances and  accommodation
    remain unchallenged by the Secretary of  State.  There  is  no  alleged
    error in the approach taken or in the findings made and so they  remain
    undisturbed.

 9. In short the Judge erred in considering Appendix FM-SE when it did  not
    apply. In doing so she raised an additional requirement  that  did  not
    apply to these appeals and dismissed the appeal when, on the facts that
    she had found, the appeal should have been allowed. As there is no need
    for there to be any further enquiry into the facts  of  the  case  this
    appeal can be dealt with on the basis of the  findings  made  by  Judge
    Pacey in the decision of the 1st of October 2015. On that basis  I  set
    aside the decision to the extent that  the  appeal  was  dismissed  and
    remake the decision allowing the appeals of the Appellants.



CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I  remake  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   relying   on   the
unchallenged findings made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  and  allow  the
appeals of the Appellants.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  make  no
order.

Fee Award

In the light of the decision to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award  (rule  23A
(costs) o f the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005  and
section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award in the sum of �280.

Reasons: The appeal is allowed on the basis of  the  findings  made  by  the
First-tier Tribunal Judge and in the absence of any evidence  from  the  ECO
who had disregarded  directions  to  serve  relevant  documentation  on  the
Tribunal. The appeal should have been allowed  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
and accordingly a fee award is appropriate.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
Dated: 16th August 2016
