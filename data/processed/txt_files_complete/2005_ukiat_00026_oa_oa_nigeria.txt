                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by two citizens of Nigeria, respectively  the  husband
   and the daughter of the sponsor, against the decision of an adjudicator,
   Mr E A W Jones, sitting at Taylor House on 27 May  2004.  Permission  to
   appeal was given mainly on the question of whether the  adjudicator  had
   limited his consideration of whether the claimant and his wife  intended
   to live together to the evidence as at the date of decision.    This  is
   based on what the adjudicator said at paragraph 17 of his decision,

   The evidence  of  contact  between  the  parties  is  mainly  after  the
   decision.  This is surprising if they have  been  together  since  March
   2002. This raises further doubts as to the subsistence of the marriage.


2. Miss Ramachandran explained that paragraph on the basis  that  what  the
   adjudicator says there about post-decision evidence  really  relates  to
   his credibility finding, to the  extent  that  he  makes  one,  in  that
   paragraph; and not to what he did or did not consider  relevant  to  the
   main issue of intention to live  together.  So far  as  the  credibility
   finding is concerned, it says no more than  that  this  "raises  further
   doubts" as to the subsistence of the marriage; but we should be prepared
   to accept that the adjudicator's other findings  on  that  point,  taken
   together with it, would have supported a dismissal of the appeal.


3. We are not, however, satisfied  that  the  adjudicator  did  regard  the
   evidence of contact produced before him as a serious relevant  issue  in
   itself.  Clearly what used to be called "intervening devotion"  must  be
   as relevant as a matter of law to intention to live together as it  used
   to be to primary purpose; but, contrary to the position with for example
   the standard of proof in asylum cases, this has not for some  time  been
   adjudicators' daily fare, and we do not think we can  assume  that  this
   adjudicator did regard "intervening devotion" as relevant  to  the  main
   issue before him. If he had done so, then in  our  view  he  would  have
   needed to deal with it in more details than he did.

4. We are not clear exactly how much of the voluminous evidence put  before
   us was before the adjudicator; but in our view the adjudicator did  make
   a mistake of law on this point, and the whole of the  relevant  evidence
   will have to be re-examined. It is for this reason  that  we  allow  the
   appeal and remit the case, not to Mr Jones.  The next  adjudicator  will
   also have to consider the issues raised as to maintenance, on which  the
   relevant evidence will be as at the date of  decision.  The  sponsor  is
   strongly advised to get  represented  again  for  the  further  hearing,
   whether by IAS who appeared for her  before  the  adjudicator,  or  some
   other reputable body.
