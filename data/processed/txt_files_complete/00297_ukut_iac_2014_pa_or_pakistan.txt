Representation:

Appellant:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondents:  Mr I MacDonald QC and Mr M Iqbal (of  Counsel)  instructed  by
                    Farani Javid Taylor Solicitors

A  bank  letter,  which  does  not  specify  the  postal  address,  landline
telephone number and email address of the account  holders  is  not  thereby
"in  the  wrong  format"  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  245AA  of   the
immigration rules (documents not submitted with applications).

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. These two appeals have been conjoined from the outset as they  arise
       out of the same facts and circumstances.  They were heard in  tandem
       with two other appeals, namely the cases of Fayyaz  and  Durrani,[1]
       as all of these cases raise certain comparable  issues  relating  to
       the proper construction of those provisions of the Immigration Rules
       regulating the acquisition of what is known as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
       Migrant Status (described hereinafter  as  "entrepreneurial  migrant
       status"). The relevant  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  are
       appended hereto.


    2. Whereas the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  ("the
       Secretary of State") is  the  appealing  party,  we  shall,  in  the
       interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature
       of the decision at first instance.

    3. Parvaiz Akhter and Chandni Maqbool  (hereinafter  "the  Appellants")
       are nationals of  Pakistan,  aged  31  and  33  respectively.   They
       applied,   unsuccessfully,   to   the   Secretary   of   State   for
       entrepreneurial migrant status. Their ensuing appeals to the  First-
       tier Tribunal ("the FtT") were  allowed.   The  Secretary  of  State
       appeals, with permission, to this Tribunal.

    4. From December 2009 and February 2010 the Appellants, in  turn,  have
       been lawfully present in the United Kingdom, having  the  status  of
       Tier 4 (General) Student.  On 12 December 2012 they made a  combined
       application to the Secretary of State  for  Entrepreneurial  Migrant
       Status.  They  were  proposing  to  operate  a  business  enterprise
       jointly.   Accompanying and forming part of their  application  were
       several documents.  These included in particular the following:

          a) A letter dated 05 December 2012 from the HBL  Bank  of  Lahore,
             certifying that two named persons had a current account in  the
             bank with a credit balance of  a  specified  amount  which  was
             "available at all times and  transferrable  anywhere  including
             UK" on request of the  customers.   It  further  confirmed  the
             identity of the relevant authorised state financial institution
             and enclosed a statement of account.


          b) A Declaration (or affidavit) identifying and signed by the  two
             bank  customers   confirming   a   credit   bank   balance   of
             approximately �260,000, describing the  Appellants  as  "family
             friends" and affirming the  availability  of  �200,000  to  the
             Appellants "to set up business in UK".

          c) An accompanying written confirmation signed by a Lahore lawyer.

    5. During the period of the next four  months,  the  UK  Border  Agency
       ("UKBA") corresponded twice with one of the Appellants.   The  first
       letter  intimated  that  with  effect  from  30  January  2013   the
       Immigration Rules had been revised by the introduction of a  genuine
       entrepreneur test and a  requirement  for  applicants  to  hold  the
       necessary minimum funds, or invest them in the relevant business, on
       a continuing basis, applicable to all applications, including  those
       submitted prior  to  the  operative  date.   The  purpose  of  these
       revisions was described as to "....  ensure that abuse of this route
       is tackled so that we can continue to attract the brightest and  the
       best".  In the second of the two letters, written approximately  one
       month later, the Appellant Ms Maqbool was  requested  to  attend  an
       interview at a specified time,  date  and  place.  This  Appellant's
       witness statement  and  the  letter  combine  to  confirm  that  the
       interview was conducted on 28 May 2013.  This Appellant asserts:

             "In the interview I submitted a further letter from  HBL  Bank
             with a Declaration and letter from  Law  Associates.   I  also
             explained to the interviewer that I was  receiving  the  funds
             from my father's friend in Pakistan, who wanted to  invest  in
             business in the UK."

       Chronologically, the next material development was the Secretary  of
       State's refusal decision, contained in a UKBA letter dated  18  June
       2013.

    6. In common with the Appellants in the related  appeals  and,  indeed,
       every applicant for entrepreneurial migrant status, it was necessary
       for these Appellants to score 75 points in respect of  "attributes".
       This is not in dispute.  It is also common ground that  the  minimum
       funding to which they  had  to  demonstrate  access  was,  in  their
       particular case, �200,000.  Further, they had to achieve  10  points
       in respect of the English language  requirement  and  10  points  in
       respect of the maintenance (funds)  requirement:  they  did  so  and
       nothing turns on this.

    7. We turn to  examine  the  Secretary  of  State's  refusal  decision.
       Having  made  reference  to  the  three  documents  which  we   have
       highlighted in [4] above, the letter continues:

             "However, the bank letter is not acceptable  because  it  does
             not state your name and the name of your entrepreneurial  team
             partner. Furthermore, no contact details for the  third  party
             were given.  The bank letter must confirm  the  third  party's
             contact details, including their full address including postal
             code,  landline  phone  number  and  any  email  address.   In
             accordance with paragraph 41 of Appendix A of the  Immigration
             Rules, you are therefore not considered to have access to  the
             funds that you have claimed."

       As a result, the Appellants' claim for 25  points  was  allocated  a
       score of 0 points.  Consequentially, their  further  claims  for  25
       points in respect of "funds held in regulated financial institution"
       and 25 points in respect of "funds disposal in the  United  Kingdom"
       were also refused. This was described in argument  as  the  "domino"
       effect.  Thus they scored 0 points instead of the requisite 75.

    8. The appeal to and resulting decision of the FtT ensued.  As  in  the
       related Durrani case, the first ground of appeal advanced  was  that
       paragraph 41-SD(a) of the  Immigration  Rules  did  not  govern  the
       Appellants' application.  Rather, it was governed only by  paragraph
       41-SD(b).  We pause to observe that on appeal to this Tribunal  this
       argument was no longer pursued.  The alternative argument, which was
       maintained before us, was that if the application  was  governed  by
       paragraph 41-SD(a)(i), the sixth of the 11 listed requirements could
       not be satisfied and was, hence, absurd.  This  alternative,  second
       ground of appeal, was based on certain  contentions  concerning  the
       relationship of banker and customer.


    9. The FtT rejected the first ground of appeal.   With  regard  to  the
       second, alternative ground, the  Judge,  having  made  reference  to
       requirements (6) and (9) in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i), stated in [10]:

             "Providing the bank has its customer's  authority  to  do  so,
             then I see no reason why this would be impermissible.  Indeed,
             that  is  precisely  what  happened  after  the  date  of  the
             decision; the Appellant's bundle includes a  letter  from  the
             Manager of Habib Bank dated 28 June 2013 ................"

       It was common ground, both at first instance and upon the hearing of
       this appeal, that the Appellants could not rely on this  letter,  by
       virtue of section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
       2002, as it postdates the impugned decision.  However, this Tribunal
       was invited to take it into account  in  its  consideration  of  the
       construction issues.  As  noted  by  the  FtT,  it  post  dates  the
       Secretary of State's decision.  It is addressed "for  the  attention
       of the UK Border Agency" and states in material part:


              "In regards to the Tier 1  application  of  [the  Appellants]
       ......


             We have the consent of  [Mr  S  and  Mrs  G]  to  share  these
             findings ...  We confirm that from  04/12/2012  to  28/06/2013
             [Mr S and Mrs G] have �259,740.52 available for investment  in
             a  business  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  deposit  with  this
             financial institution.  We have been informed by our  customer
             that all of these funds are available for  investment  in  the
             United Kingdom for the above mentioned  [Appellants]  business
             .....


             Habib Bank Limited is regulated by the State Bank of  Pakistan
             .....  The sum of �200,000 is freely  disposable/transferrable
             to the United Kingdom at the discretion of our customer."

       This letter also specified the  postal  address,  phone  number  and
       email address of the Bank's customers.

   10. Thus the FtT rejected both the primary and  alternative  grounds  of
       appeal.  However, the appeal was allowed.  The Judge  reasoned  that
       the Secretary of State's decision was not in accordance with the law
       having regard to the principle of fairness and  a  failure  to  give
       effect to the "evidential flexibility" policy.  Permission to appeal
       to this Tribunal was granted to the Secretary of State on the  basis
       that the FtT  had  arguably  erred  in  law  in  thus  holding.  The
       Appellants, by the mechanism of a Rule 24 notice (qua  Respondents),
       raised before this Tribunal the absurdity argument  which  had  been
       rejected by the FtT.

   11. In common with the other, related appeals, the  centrepiece  of  the
       arguments developed before this Tribunal was that the  Secretary  of
       State's decision was not in accordance with the law as it was  based
       on a literal  construction  of  certain  aspects  of  paragraph  41-
       SD(a)(i) of the Rules which generates absurd  results.   As  in  the
       other cases, the Appellants' arguments focused on requirements  (6),
       (9)  and  (10).   The  absurdity  arguments  are  rehearsed  in  our
       determinations in the other two appeals and we do  not  repeat  them
       here.

   12. In this appeal, the focus of attention is the Habib Bank  letter  of
       05 December  2012.   Juxtaposing  this  letter  with  the  table  of
       requirements in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of the Rules, we consider that
       this letter suffered from two defects.  First, it did not state  the
       names of the Appellants.  Second, it  did  not  specify  the  postal
       address, landline phone number and any email address of the  account
       holders.  Thus the letter was non-compliant  with  requirements  (6)
       and (10).  Our analysis is that it was compliant  with  all  of  the
       other nine requirements.  This analysis is  duly  reflected  in  the
       Secretary of State's refusal decision.


   13. We consider that the two failures which we have identified cannot be
       attributed to any absurdity or anomaly in the  requirements  of  the
       Rules under scrutiny.  We reject the Appellants' arguments  that  in
       order to avoid absurdity, it is  necessary  (a)  to  substitute  the
       words "account  holder's"  for  "applicant's"  in  requirement  (6),
       deleting the remaining words and (b) to substitute "account  holder"
       for "third party" in requirement (10).   We  have  set  out  in  our
       decision in the Durrani appeal our reasons for thus concluding.   We
       would add that, in our judgement,  this  appeal  raises  no  further
       issue in relation to the words  "provided  to"  in  requirement  (9)
       since the bank later (as noted above) stated unequivocally that  the
       necessary funds  were  "available  at  all  times  and  transferable
       anywhere including UK on  his  [ie  the  customer's]  request."   We
       would, in any event, repeat the construction of "provided to"  which
       we have espoused in Fayyaz: see [28].  This disposes of  the  issues
       raised in the Rule 24 Notice of the Appellants (qua Respondents).

   14. We turn to address the issue raised  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
       appeal, which is whether the  FtT  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
       Appellants' appeals on the ground noted in [10] above.  As  the  FtT
       recognised in [18] and [19] of its determination, the effect of this
       finding was that the Secretary  of  State  had  not  made  a  lawful
       decision and was, in consequence, under a duty to do so.   In  [14],
       the Judge noted, correctly, that paragraph 245AA of the  Immigration
       Rules had been introduced with effect from 06 September  2012.   The
       determination of the Appellants' application postdated this,  on  18
       June 2013.  It is common ground that paragraph 245AA applied to this
       application.  Paragraph 245AA was at  that  time  in  the  following
       terms:

           "245AA. Documents not submitted with applications

           (a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part 6A state
           that specified documents must be provided, the UK Border  Agency
           will only consider documents that have been submitted  with  the
           application, and will only consider  documents  submitted  after
           the application where they  are  submitted  in  accordance  with
           subparagraph (b).

           (b) If the applicant has submitted:

              (i) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the
              sequence  have  been  omitted  (for  example,  if  one   bank
              statement from a series is missing);

              (ii) A document in the wrong format; or

              (iii) A document that is a copy and not an original document,




           the  UK  Border  Agency  may  contact  the  applicant   or   his
           representative in writing, and request  the  correct  documents.
           The requested documents must be received by the UK Border Agency
           at the address specified in the request within 7 working days of
           the date of the request.

           (c) The UK Border Agency will  not  request  documents  where  a
           specified document  has  not  been  submitted  (for  example  an
           English language certificate is missing), or where the UK Border
           Agency does not anticipate that addressing the omission or error
           referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a grant because the
           application will be refused for other reasons.

           (d) If the applicant has submitted a specified document:

              (i) in the wrong format, or

              (ii) that is a copy and not an original document,

           the application may be granted exceptionally, providing  the  UK
           Border Agency is satisfied  that  the  specified  documents  are
           genuine and the applicant meets all the other requirements.  The
           UK Border Agency reserves the right  to  request  the  specified
           original documents in the correct format in all cases where  (b)
           applies, and to refuse applications if these documents  are  not
           provided as set out in (b)."

       The next step in the Judge's analysis was to refer to two  documents
       appended  to  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Rodriguez
       (Flexibility  Policy)  [2013]  UKUT  00042  (IAC).   These  are  the
       "Evidential Flexibility Instruction" and the UKBA letter of  19  May
       2011.  The Judge stated in [15]:


             "It is arguable that paragraph  245AA  needs  to  be  read  in
             conjunction with the Evidential Flexibility  instructions  and
             the UKBA's letter of 19 May 2011.....


             There is no explicit  indication  that  the  policy  has  been
             withdrawn and it is perfectly possible for policy and rules to
             co-exist ....."




[Our emphasis]

       It is evident that the "policy" to which the Judge was referring was
       a combination of the two specified documents.

   15. We consider that the Judge  erred  in  law  in  assuming  that  this
       "policy"  remained  in  existence  following  the  introduction   of
       paragraph 245AA and, hence, applied to the Appellants'  application.
       The question of whether a policy exists, in any given context, is  a
       question of fact.  There was no concession to this effect.  Absent a
       concession, an evidential foundation for this finding was necessary.
        There was none.  The contrary was not argued before this  Tribunal.
       Furthermore, the additional evidence brought to the attention of the
       Court of Appeal in the Rodriguez case suggests that the documents in
       question had no enduring force or effect when paragraph 245AA of the
       Rules was introduced: see Secretary of State for the Home Department
       - v - Rodriguez and Others [2014] EWCA Civ 2, [47]  and  [65].   The
       information  contained  in  these  passages,  though  not   formally
       admitted in evidence by the Court of Appeal, was not  challenged  by
       the Appellants before this Tribunal.  Finally, and in any event, the
       Court of Appeal reversed  the  Upper  Tribunal's  finding  that  the
       documents under scrutiny constituted a new policy: see [87].

   16. The conclusion that the FtT erred in law  in  allowing  the  appeals
       follows inexorably. Its decision must be set aside accordingly.

   17. We proceed to re-make the decision of the FtT.  The sole question is
       whether the  Secretary  of  State's  refusal  decision  was  not  in
       accordance with the law by  reference  to  paragraph  245AA  of  the
       Immigration Rules, which applied at the time  when  the  Appellants'
       joint application was  determined.   We  have  reproduced  paragraph
       245AA in [14] above.   It  provides  that  UKBA  "may"  request  the
       applicant to supply "the correct documents" in any of  three  cases,
       that is to say where -

          a) A document has been (or documents have  been)  omitted  from  a
             sequence of documents;  or


          b) A document is in the wrong format; or

          c) A copy, rather than original, document has been furnished.

       See sub-paragraph (b).


   18. The exercise of this discretionary power, or choice, is informed  by
       sub-paragraph (c).  We refer to our finding in [12] above  that  the
       material defects in the Appellant's application were that  the  bank
       letter did not state the names of the Appellants and did not specify
       the postal address, landline phone number and any email  address  of
       the account holders.  We are of the opinion that paragraph 245AA(b),
       accorded its ordinary and natural meaning, is not engaged  in  these
       circumstances.  We consider that an application suffering from these
       shortcomings does not fall  within  any  of  the  three  categories.
       Accordingly, the  Appellants  cannot  invoke  paragraph  245  AA  in
       support of  a  contention  that  they  should  have  been  given  an
       opportunity to rectify the deficiencies in  their  application.   It
       follows that the Secretary of State  did  not  err  in  law  in  not
       offering this facility to them.  Thus the decision of the FtT cannot
       survive.

DECISION

18.  We set aside the decision of the FtT and  re-make  same  by  dismissing
       the Appellants' appeals. Thus we  allow  the  Secretary  of  State's
