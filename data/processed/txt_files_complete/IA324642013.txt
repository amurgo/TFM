For the Respondent:    Ms E. Savage, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on  25th  December  1987.   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 18th July 2013 to
    refuse to issue him with a residence card as confirmation of his  right
    of residence in the United  Kingdom  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  ("the  2006   Regulations").    The
    Appellant stated that he was the spouse of a citizen  of  Belgium,  Mrs
    Dorcas Owusu ("the Sponsor"), who was present  in  the  United  Kingdom
    exercising treaty rights.  The  application  was  refused  because  the
    Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant and  his  Sponsor  were
    married as claimed. The Appellant's appeal was  allowed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Chohan sitting  at  Sheldon  Court,  Birmingham  on  5th
    November 2014.  The Respondent appeals with leave against that decision
    and the matter thus comes before me in the first place as an appeal  by
    the Respondent against the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision.   For  the
    reasons which I have set out below I  have  set  aside  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision and remade the decision in this  case.   Therefore,
    for the sake of convenience I will continue to refer to the parties  as
    they were known at first instance.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  21st  June  2010  with  a
    visit visa which was valid until 26th October 2010.  He and the Sponsor
    were married by proxy at a customary marriage in Ghana on 7th  November
    2012.  This case has an unfortunate history which I need  not  rehearse
    here save to say that a previous appeal by the  Appellant  against  the
    Respondent's decision of 18th July 2013 had been allowed on the  papers
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mulvenna on 11th March 2014.   That
    decision was set aside, the appeal was remitted back to the First  Tier
    and the matter eventually came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chohan
    on 5th November 2014.

The Hearing at First Instance

3.   Judge Chohan recorded in his determination that at the  outset  of  the
    hearing before him the Appellant's solicitor (who also appeared  before
    me) submitted that  the  Appellant  and  his  partner,  Ms  Owusu,  the
    Sponsor, had made enquiries regarding recognition of their marriage  in
    Belgium but the enquiries had not been fruitful.  As such the Appellant
    would  no  longer  be  proceeding  under  Regulation  7  of  the   2006
    Regulations (that he was married to  the  Sponsor)  but  instead  under
    Regulation 8(5) of the 2006 Regulations on the basis that  he  and  the
    Sponsor were in a durable  relationship.   It  was  accepted  that  the
    Sponsor was in employment and therefore a qualified person.  The  issue
    was whether the Appellant and Sponsor were in a durable relationship.

4.   Although there was no documentary evidence of a tenancy  agreement  the
    Judge held that was not fatal to the  Appellant's  claim.   There  were
    some minor discrepancies in the oral testimony but they too did not  go
    to the core of the Appellant's claim.  The majority of the  documentary
    evidence in respect of utility bills, bank statements etc. were in  the
    Sponsor's name.  There was one document from Aviva in respect  of  life
    insurance, which was in  joint  names.   The  TV  licence  was  in  the
    Appellant's name.  The documentary evidence, described by Judge  Chohan
    as "limited", did nevertheless show that the Appellant and the  Sponsor
    had the same address.  He was satisfied that the Appellant and  Sponsor
    lived together and they had been since November 2012 in a  relationship
    akin  to  marriage.   Regulation  8(5)  of  the  2006  Regulations  was
    therefore met.  The Judge did not proceed  to  consider  Article  8  in
    those circumstances.

The Onward Appeal

5.   The Respondent appealed against that decision arguing  that  the  issue
    of a residence card to an extended family member was at the  discretion
    of the Respondent and as such the matter should have been referred back
    to the Respondent for reconsideration.  The  grounds  cited  Regulation
    17(4) of the 2006 Regulations which provides that  the  Respondent  may
    issue a residence card to an extended  family  member  if  in  all  the
    circumstances it appears to the Respondent  appropriate  to  issue  the
    residence card.  As the Respondent had not yet  considered  the  matter
    under Regulation 17(4) the Judge  had  erred  in  allowing  the  appeal
    outright.

6.   The Respondent relied in her grounds on  the  case  of  Ihemedu  [2011]
    UKUT 00340, whose head note states:

         "Regulation 17(4) makes  the  issue  of  a  residence  card  to  an
         OFM/extended family member  a  matter  of  discretion.   Where  the
         Secretary of State has not yet exercised that discretion  the  most
         an Immigration Judge is entitled to do is to allow  the  appeal  as
         being not in accordance with the law leaving the matter of  whether
         to exercise this discretion in the Appellant's favour or not to the
         Secretary of State."

7.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes on 21st  January  2015.   In  granting
    permission to appeal he wrote that:

         "The Appellant relied upon a proxy marriage in Ghana to  a  Belgian
         national, conducted whilst he had no immigration status in the  UK.
         He has a poor immigration history.  The Respondent considered  that
         there was no lawful marriage or if there were it was a marriage  of
         convenience and there was in truth no durable relationship  between
         the couple.

         The Appellant abandoned the argument before the  Tribunal  that  he
         had entered into a lawful marriage with the Sponsor and that he was
         her spouse as defined in  the  EEA  Regulations.   The  appeal  was
         pursued on the sole ground  that  the  Appellant  was  an  extended
         family  member  of  the  Sponsor  by  virtue   of   their   durable
         relationship under Regulation 8.

         If the appeal was properly to be allowed  on  the  basis  that  the
         Appellant was an extended family member of the Sponsor the decision
         reveals that the Judge did not  refer  himself  to  Ihemedu  or  to
         Moneke [2011] UKUT 430 and did not allow the appeal on the  limited
         basis that Regulation 8 having been made out the Respondent  should
         now consider the exercise of her discretion under Regulation 17(4).
          Even if the requirements of Regulation  8  were  made  out  it  is
         arguable that the Judge should not have simply allowed  the  appeal
         because in doing so neither he nor the  Respondent  had  considered
         how the Regulation 17 discretion should be exercised.  The grant of
         a residence card to an EFM being a two stage  process,  the  second
         stage had therefore not yet been undertaken."

8.   The Appellant  responded  to  the  grant  of  permission  in  a  letter
    addressed to the Presenting Officers Unit dated 24th  February  2015  a
    copy of which was sent to the court.  The letter stated:

         "We agree with the position taken by the Tribunal Judge J M  Holmes
         and suggest your agreement to the consent order below to save  time
         and costs.  Immigration Judge Chohan  in  his  determination  dated
         27th November 2014 was  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
         requirements of Regulation 8(5) of the 2006 Regulations  [paragraph
         15].  He allowed the appeal under the 2006  Regulations  [paragraph
         17].  In short the Appellant has shown that they are in  a  durable
         relationship for the purpose of Regulation 8(5) and thus  that  she
         is  an  extended  family  member  for  the  purposes  of  the   EEA
         Regulations.  Regulation  17(14)  of  the  Regulations  provides  a
         discretion to the Secretary of State to issue a residence  card  to
         an extended family member.  In the Appellant's case  the  Secretary
         of State has not yet considered the exercise  of  such  discretion.
         It is not open to an Immigration Judge to consider the exercise  of
         discretion absent the Secretary of State first doing  so.   In  the
         circumstances we suggest that we  both  agree  by  consent  without
         attending court that:

         The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  an  error  on  a
         point of law and is set aside.  The decision is remade as  follows:
         the appeal is allowed to the extent that the application for an EEA
         residence card remains outstanding before the Secretary of State."

9.   There was no response to that letter from the Respondent;  I  was  told
    by the Presenting Officer that it had only reached her  yesterday.   It
    was agreed by both parties that the findings  of  fact  made  by  Judge
    Chohan should be preserved when the matter was  once  more  before  the
    Respondent to make a fresh decision.

Findings

10.  In granting permission to appeal Judge Holmes stated  the  matter  very
    succinctly.  It was not open  to  Judge  Chohan  to  allow  the  appeal
    outright under Regulation 8, particularly in  the  circumstances  where
    the Appellant's appeal under Regulation  7  had  been  withdrawn.   The
    Respondent was not seeking for the Tribunal to rehear the whole  appeal
    all over again but  rather  for  the  matter  to  go  back  before  the
    Respondent to be considered in line with the discretion provided  under
    Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 Regulations.   In  my  view  that  was  an
    eminently sensible solutionfollowing a very sensible suggestion made by
    the Appellant's solicitor.  I indicated therefore that I found an error
    of law in Judge Chohan's decision which I  set  aside  (save  that  his
    findings of fact were all  preserved)  and  that  I  would  remake  the
    decision in this case by allowing the Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision to refuse to issue a residence card to the extent
    that the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the  law  and
    remained outstanding for the Respondent to take.

11.  In those circumstances I too do not consider the  issue  of  Article  8
    and the matter is now once again before  the  Respondent  to  consider.
    Given the unfortunate history of this matter and the  number  of  times
    that it has been before the  Tribunal  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  the
    Respondent will consider  this  matter  in  accordance  with  the  2006
    Regulations as soon  as  possible.   In  considering  this  matter  the
    Respondent should have a copy of  Judge  Chohan's  determination  which
    will inform her decision-making as Judge Chohan's findings of fact have
    been preserved.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set  it  aside.   I  remake  the  decision  by  allowing  the
Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to the extent that  the
Respondent's decision is not in accordance with the law.

Appellant's appeal allowed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I do not disturb the fee award of �80 made by Judge Chohan which  took  into
account the fact that on the one hand  the  Appellant  had  been  successful
below  but  on  the  other  hand  had  submitted  a  substantial  amount  of
information at a relatively late stage.
