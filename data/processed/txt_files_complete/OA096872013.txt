                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Iraq born on 1  April  1993  appeals,  with
    permission, against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Turquet who in a determination promulgated on 3 February 2014 dismissed
    the appellant's appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  Amman  to  refuse  her  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse.   Her
    application, which had been made in January  2013  was  refused  on  27
    March under the provisions of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

2.   The refusal asserted that the Entry Clearance Officer  did  not  accept
    that  the  relationship  was  genuine  and  subsisting  nor  that   the
    maintenance requirements of the Rules were met.

3.   The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge Turquet on 10  January  2014.
    She noted the reasons for refusal on the basis that  the  marriage  was
    not subsisting.  In brief these were that the appellant had stated that
    the wedding  had  been  arranged  by  their  respective  families,  the
    appellant and the sponsor had not married in their home country of Iraq
    in the presence of family members but in Jordan and that they  had  not
    spent any time together since they had married on 6  January  2013  and
    the appellant had applied for entry clearance six  days  later.   There
    was no evidence of the prior arrangements which had been  made  by  the
    respective families in Iran and Iraq for the wedding  and  it  was  not
    evident that they were present at the marriage.  There was no  evidence
    of shared financial responsibility.

4.   The sponsor's evidence was that  the  appellant's  father  had  been  a
    friend of his father and while staying with him he had got to know  the
    appellant and had fallen in love with her and they had spent a  lot  of
    time together.  His mother had agreed but the  appellant's  father  was
    more cautious and wanted to make enquiries about the appellant.  Having
    done so, he agreed to the wedding.  There had been an engagement  party
    in the appellant's family home in September 2011 and they  had  decided
    to marry in Jordan because they understood that  marriage  certificates
    from Iraq were often challenged by the British authorities.   They  had
    married in a registry office in Amman with witnesses  and  then  stayed
    together in a hotel there before the appellant had returned to Britain.
     After he had returned he had communicated with the appellant by e-mail
    and other modern methods of communication.  They had both been upset by
    the refusal.

5.   When considering the marriage the judge said that she considered  there
    was very  little  supporting  evidence  that  there  was  a  subsisting
    marriage at the date of decision.  She stated there was no evidence  of
    the marriage taking place in Iraq (an error as the marriage took  place
    in Jordan) and there  was  no  evidence  from  the  appellant's  family
    confirming the reasons for the marriage  taking  place  away  from  the
    country where they lived.  She went on to state:-

         "The sponsor was keen for me to see engagement DVD.   However  this
         is not evidence that a marriage subsists.  Evidence  post  decision
         is admissible if it throws light on the circumstances at  the  date
         of decision.  In this case the couple had not seen each other since
         last January.  I found  the  sponsor's  evidence  for  this  to  be
         unsatisfactory and not consistent with  him  being  a  party  to  a
         genuine and subsisting marriage.  He said he could not go back  and
         see his wife because there was no time.  He initially said that  he
         only got two weeks holiday and  it  cost  too  much.   However  his
         contract indicates that he gets 25 working  days  plus  eight  bank
         holidays.  The contract refers to a five day week, which would give
         him over five weeks' holiday."


6.   She noted that there was a record of e-mails, texts and phone bills  to
    December 2012 but said there was  no  supporting  evidence  of  contact
    between the end of 2012 and the photographs of the  couple  in  Jordan.
    There was no supporting evidence of contact  since  the  wedding.   She
    also stated there was no evidence of money being sent by the sponsor to
    his wife.

7.   In the grounds of appeal it was argued that the sponsor  had  explained
    that there was no embassy to which he and his wife could travel in Iraq
    and it was easier for them to travel to Jordan to get married and  make
    the application.  Moreover,  there  was  in  the  bundle  of  documents
    evidence that money had been sent by the sponsor to the appellant.  The
    reason that the sponsor had not been able to travel to Iraq to see  his
    wife was that he had two jobs in Britain  and  therefore  although  one
    contract gave him time off he was still working for the other  employer
    during the holidays from the other job.

8.   I  consider  that  the  judge  made  material  errors  of  law  in  her
    assessment of the evidence relating to the appellant's marriage in that
    she does not appear to have taken into account the  evidence  that  the
    sponsor was sending money to the appellant, that there was  a  sensible
    and reasonable explanation as to why the appellant and the sponsor  had
    married in Jordan and that the judge appeared to have placed no  weight
    on the evidence of electronic communication in the bundle let alone the
    photographs and the DVD of the engagement ceremony.  It is  bizarre  to
    consider that where an elaborate engagement ceremony such as that shown
    on the DVD takes place that somehow the marriage  was  not  subsisting.
    The period between the engagement ceremony and the marriage application
    was just over 15 months.  For a marriage to be subsisting it must  have
    been genuine in the first place and there is clear evidence  that  this
    was a genuine marriage.  I  cannot  conceive  of  a  situation  in  the
    appellant's culture where there would be such an  elaborate  engagement
    ceremony when the relationship was not genuine.  I  do  not  understand
    the judge's comment in paragraph 18 of  the  determination  that  there
    seemed to be little evidence of what happened between December 2012 and
    the date of the application given that that was a matter  of  days  and
    moreover that the evidence of the sponsor was that he and the appellant
    stayed in a hotel in Amman after the wedding until the sponsor  had  to
    return to Britain.   Moreover,  I  also  accept  that  he  has  limited
    opportunity to travel to see his wife given that he has two jobs  here.
    I do not consider that the suggestion of the judge that  the  appellant
    and his wife could meet in Europe is viable particularly given that the
    appellant is Iraqi and has a refusal of entry clearance evidenced  from
    her passport.  I consider that the chance of her being able  to  travel
    to Europe for a short stay is extremely unlikely.

9.   Finally I would add that I observed the sponsor  through  the  hearing.
    He was clearly a man who was upset by the delay and I would conclude by
    stating that I am convinced that this is a genuine marriage.   I  would
    add that Mr McVeety also accepted that the marriage was genuine.

10.  However the application was  also  refused  on  the  grounds  that  the
    appellant did not meet  the  maintenance  requirements  of  the  Rules.
    These are that the sponsor must be able to show that he was earning the
    sum of �18,600 at the date of the decision.  The issue is that to  show
    that he was earning that sum the rigid financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules must be met.

11.  Having considered the documentary evidence it  is  my  conclusion  that
    the sponsor is earning over the requisite sum of �18,600.  I reach that
    conclusion particularly taking into account the letter of  3  September
    2013 from HM Revenue and Customs confirming his employment history  and
    his PAYE coding.  That letter records his employment with Toyoda  Gosei
    UK Limited with a salary of �14,083 on which he paid tax  of  �1,194.80
    and his employment with Bakhtyar Abdullah Agha where his pay  from  the
    start date of 15 July 2012 to 5 April 2013 was �5,790 with the  payment
    of tax of �202.20.  I also note the  P60s  in  the  appellant's  bundle
    together with the relevant payslips showing deduction of  tax.   Indeed
    it is accepted that the sums showing his income from  Toyoda  Gosei  UK
    Limited are as asserted by the sponsor.  However the difficulty relates
    to the evidence required showing the appellant's income  from  Bakhtyar
    Abdullah Agha whose business "Select and Save" was the sponsor's second
    employer.  In order to provide appropriate evidence for that employment
    the appellant had to show the relevant documents as set out in Appendix
    E-ECP.3.3 of the Rules which in turn refer to paragraph EC-P.1.1(d)  of
    Appendix FM of the Rules.  The specified documents are  set  out  under
    Appendix  FM-SE  which  states  in  the  section  headed  "Evidence  of
    financial requirements" at paragraph 2  that  in  respect  of  salaried
    employment a P60 for the relevant period should be provided  if  issued
    and then refers to wage slips covering a period of six months prior  to
    the date of application or any period of  salaried  employment  in  the
    twelve months prior to the date of application  if  the  applicant  had
    been employed by their current employer for less than six months and  a
    letter from  the  employer  who  issued  the  payslips  confirming  the
    person's employment and  gross  annual  salary,  the  length  of  their
    employment, the period over which they have been or were paid the level
    of salary relied upon in the application and  the  type  of  employment
    together with a signed contract and monthly  personal  bank  statements
    corresponding to the same period as the wage slips.  The difficulty for
    the appellant is that although there were wage  slips  for  the  period
    August 2012 to the end of  January  2013,  these  did  not  necessarily
    correspond to the sums paid into the appellant's bank  and  indeed  one
    payment into the bank was missing.  Moreover the  appellant's  contract
    for his work  with  "Select  and  Save"  had  not  been  submitted.   I
    therefore must conclude that the appellant's appeal could  not  succeed
    under the terms of the Immigration Rules.  I  therefore  conclude  that
    there is o material error of law in  the  judge's  decision  that  this
    appeal cannot succeed under the financial requirements of the rules.

12.  I have very considerable sympathy with the sponsor  and  the  appellant
    in this case in that I believe that the sponsor's  work  brings  in  an
    income of over �18,600 and that therefore the principal  issue  in  the
    financial requirements - the income threshold - is met.  However,  this
    is not a situation in which the "evidential flexibility" provisions  of
    Rule 245AA would be relevant given that it is not the case  that  there
    is merely one in  a  series  of  documents  is  missing  and  that  the
    appellant should be given the opportunity to provide that  document.  I
    have therefore concluded  that  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  do
    anything other than dismiss this appeal on immigration grounds.

13.   Moreover,  I  do  not  consider  that  there   are   any   exceptional
    circumstances which are relevant in this case -  there  is  nothing  to
    indicate that the appellant and his wife would  not  live  together  in
    Iraq.  I would add that while I note that the judgment of Blake J in MM
    [2013] EWHC 1900 indicates that Blake J considered that  an  income  of
    �13,400 would be an appropriate income level and that  that  sum  would
    mean that the appellants would meet the financial requirements  of  the
    Rules,  the judgment in MM has been appealed to the Court of Appeal and
    I consider that it would be inappropriate to allow this appeal not only
    because the appeal against the decision of Blake J in MM is before  the
    Court of Appeal but also because the conclusion of Blake J was that  it
    was not appropriate to strike down the financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

14.  I consider that it is  not  unduly  harsh  to  conclude  that  a  fresh
    application should be made particularly as it appears that applications
    in Jordan are dealt with relatively quickly.  I would emphasise that  I
    believe this is  a  genuine  marriage  and  I  also  believe  that  the
    sponsor's income is  above  the  income  threshold  in  the  Rules.   I
    therefore trust that when an application  is  made  with  the  relevant
    specified documents it should be dealt with speedily and I  trust  that
    provided the specified documents are produced, entry clearance will  be
    granted.


Decision.
        The determination of the Judge of  the  first-tier  dismissing  this
    appeal on immigration and human rights grounds shall stand.
