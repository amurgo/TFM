                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This determination refers to parties as they were in the  First-tier
       Tribunal.

    2. The SSHD appeals against a determination by a panel  of  the  First-
       tier  Tribunal  comprising  Judge  Ievins  and  Mrs  S  Hewitt   JP,
       promulgated on  27  March  2014,  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal
       against deportation to Vietnam.

    3.  The  lengthy  immigration,  criminal  and  procedural  history   is
       summarised in the respondent's notice of decision dated 6 and served
       on 11 December 2013.  The live issue remaining was whether Article 8
       of the ECHR and in particular the best interests of the  appellant's
       children  constituted  exceptional  circumstances  outweighing   the
       public interest in deportation.  The respondent found that they  did
       not.  The panel concluded that they did.

    4. The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal are all  directed
       at failure to give reasons, or adequate  reasons,  for  the  panel's
       findings on material matters.

    5.  Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that  looking  at  the  findings  in   the
       determination,   together   with   preserved   findings   from   the
       determination of the panel which  heard  an  earlier  appeal  on  19
       January 2011, this was accepted to be a close family, and the result
       of deportation would be to leave the 4 children in a  single  parent
       unit, but no exceptional circumstances appeared (�1 of the grounds).
         Some  contact  could  be  maintained,  and  the  consequences   of
       separation could be  mitigated  (�2).   Deportation  does  break  up
       families.  The panel erred in its treatment of the public  interest.
       The panel thought there was little risk of re-offending, but did not
       consider whether the  appellant  had  addressed  his  problems  with
       alcohol, manifest in the 1997 offence, and should have noted that he
       still had the same associates.  The panel treated the  appellant  as
       now being older and a family man, but when he reoffended in 2007  he
       was already aged 42 and a family  man  with   young  children.   The
       concepts of deterrence and of public revulsion at serious  offending
       were given  insufficient  weight.   There  was  nothing  to  justify
       finding "a very strong claim indeed".  Notwithstanding a  degree  of
       rehabilitation, some crimes were so serious that it would always  be
       proportionate to deport.  While all cases were fact  sensitive,  the
       lengthy custodial sentences  for  offences,  one  involving  serious
       violence and both involving firearms,  were  such  that  deportation
       ought not to have been found  disproportionate.   The  determination
       should be set aside and the decision remade.  That could be done  in
       the Upper Tribunal as there was no need to revisit the  findings  of
       primary fact.


    6. I pressed Mr Whitwell on whether his final submission amounted to an
       argument that no rational panel of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  could
       properly have found in favour of the appellant.  He  said  that  the
       respondent did not go so far as  to  argue  that  the  decision  was
       perverse, rather that it was flawed by inadequacy  of  reasoning  on
       exceptional circumstances and on the public interest.

    7. Mr Jafar in his helpful skeleton argument and in submissions  argued
       along the following lines.  The panel  justifiably  found  that  the
       family situation  was  not  just  of  ordinary  but  of  exceptional
       strength.  The appellant's absence was seriously detrimental to  all
       four children, and to one in particular.  The panel applied all  the
       relevant authorities.  There had been no evidence to suggest ongoing
       problems  with  alcohol.   The  matter  of  continuing   undesirable
       associations  was  dealt  with  in  re-examination,  and  the  panel
       resolved the point in the  appellant's  favour.   There  was  strong
       evidence of rehabilitation and of low risk  of  reoffending  from  a
       probation officer.  The matters of revulsion and deterrence, and  of
       the very serious nature of the offending, were all dealt  with,  and
       the  public  interest  fully  factored  in.    The   panel   reached
       conclusions properly open to it and the  grounds  amounted  only  to
       reargument and disagreement.

    8. Mr Jafar accepted my observations that this was  a  finely  balanced
       case which different panels might have decided otherwise, and that a
       determination rehearsing all the  points  mentioned  in  the  SSHD's
       grounds and in submissions and coming down on the other  side  would
       have been very difficult to attack as a matter of law.

    9. I indicated that the SSHD's appeal would be dismissed.

   10. The SSHD does not go so far as to submit that there could rationally
       have been only one outcome.  The case was at best for the  appellant
       finely balanced.  No doubt some panels would have decided the  other
       way.  Whether the outcome might be considered generous is beside the
       point.  While the grounds and submissions have mounted all available
       challenges to the determination, I agree with the submission for the
       appellant that these  resolve  into  no  more  than  reargument  and
       disagreement.  All the legal and factual  matters  stressed  by  the
       SSHD in the grounds and in submissions are thoroughly and  carefully
       dealt with in the determination.


   11. The First-tier Tribunal reached a conclusion properly  open  to  it.
       No flaw in its factual analysis or legal approach has been  exposed.
       Its determination shall stand.
