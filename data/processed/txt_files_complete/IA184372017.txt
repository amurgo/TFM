Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr T. Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Hossain, instructed by SG Law Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By my decision promulgated on 28 March 2017 (appended to this
    decision), I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").
    I hereby remake the decision of the FtT.


 2. The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is a citizen of Thailand
    born on July 1972 who entered the UK in September 2010 as a Tier 2
    General Migrant. In March 2013 she began living with a partner and on
    29 January 2015 applied for leave to remain on the basis of her private
    and family life in the UK.


   3. The factual background, which has changed in the intervening period
      since the Secretary of State refused the claimant's application, is
      not contentious. Having considered the written evidence as well as the
      oral evidence of the claimant and her husband at the hearing before
      me, I make the following findings of fact:


   a) The claimant has been in the UK unlawfully since 2013, when her leave
      to remain as a Tier 2 General Migrant ceased.


   b) In 2012 she met a Thai national who subsequently became a British
      citizen. They started living together in March 2013 and married on 19
      April 2017.


   c) The marriage is genuine (as acknowledged by Mr Melvin).


   d) They have a son, born on [ ] 2016, who is a British citizen.


   e) The claimant's English language ability is limited. She took a test
      before coming to the UK in 2010 but has not taken one subsequently. At
      the hearing she communicated through an interpreter. Her evidence was
      that her English is better than her husband's, which I accept. My
      finding, in sum, is that neither the claimant nor her husband speak
      English, other than at a basic level, but the claimant's language
      skills are stronger than her husbands.


   f) The claimant and her husband are culturally and linguistically
      connected to Thailand, where they both have family (including
      parents).


   g) The claimant's husband and child are Thai citizens as well as British
      citizens.


   h) The claimant's husband has his own Thai restaurant, from which he
      earns in excess of �20,000 a year, and where he has five employees.


   i) If the claimant is removed from the UK, she will bring her son with
      her to Thailand, as although she would prefer him to live in the UK,
      her husband needs to work to maintain the family. Her husband would
      remain in the UK as they are concerned that if he returns with her to
      Thailand he will not be able to find work or earn sufficient money to
      support the family. She would, if returned to Thailand, seek re-entry
      to the UK as a spouse as soon as possible.


 4. It was common ground that the claimant was unable to succeed under the
    Immigration Rules as at the time she made her application she was not
    married and had not been living with her partner for two years, which
    is the minimum required under GEN 1.2 of Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules.
 5. It was also common ground that removal of the claimant, who has a
    British husband and British son, would constitute an interference with
    respect for family life of sufficient gravity as to potentially to
    engage the operation of Article 8 such that the issue to be resolved
    was whether removal of the claimant was proportionate.


 6. The assessment of proportionality requires consideration to be given to
    the mandatory considerations in Section 117B of the Immigration,
    Nationality and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").  My consideration of
    the factors specified in Section 117B are as follows:


     a) Section 117B(1). The first consideration is that maintenance of
        effective immigration control is in the public interest. I give
        particular weight to this consideration as the claimant has been in
        the UK unlawfully for several years. She justified her failure to
        apply before her leave expired on the basis of poor health. Whilst
        I accept she has had some health difficulties, these have not been
        of sufficient gravity to explain or justify her failure to comply
        with the law and do not mitigate against the weight I attach to
        this consideration.


     b) Section 117B(2). The second consideration is that it is in the
        public interest for immigrants to speak English. The evidence
        before me is that the claimant has a poor command of English.


     c) Section 117B(3). The third consideration concerns financial
        independence. The claimant is married to a man who has established
        a business and who earns over �20,000 per year. In my view, it is
        more likely than not that she will not be a burden on the taxpayer.


     d) Section 117B(4) and (5). The claimant's private life and
        relationship with her husband were established, at best, whilst her
        status was precarious, and to a substantial extent whilst in the UK
        unlawfully. Accordingly, I attach little weight to her private and
        family life with her husband.


 7. I now turn to consider Section 117B(6), which states that:
           In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
           public interest does not require the person's removal where-
           (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
           relationship with a qualifying child, and
           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
           United Kingdom.
 8. The affect of Section 117B(6) on an Article 8 proportionality
    assessment was explained by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ
    705 as follows:


         17..[T]here can be no doubt that section 117B(6) must be read as a
         self-contained provision in the sense that Parliament has
         stipulated that where the conditions specified in the sub-section
         are satisfied, the public interest will not justify removal. It is
         not legitimate to have regard to public interest considerations
         unless that is permitted, either explicitly or implicitly, by the
         subsection itself.
         ...
         19 In my judgment, therefore, the only questions which courts and
         tribunals need to ask when applying section 117B(6) are the
         following:
         (1) Is the applicant liable to deportation? If so, section 117B is
         inapplicable and instead the relevant code will usually be found in
         section 117C.
         (2) Does the applicant have a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship with the child?
         (3) Is the child a qualifying child as defined in section 117D?
         (4) Is it unreasonable to expect the child to leave the United
         Kingdom?
         20.If the answer to the first question is no, and to the other
         three questions is yes, the conclusion must be that article 8 is
         infringed.
 9. In this appeal, it was common ground that the answer to the first
    question under Section 117B(6) was no and the answers to the second and
    third questions were yes. Accordingly, the only issue in contention in
    respect of Section 117B(6) was the reasonableness of expecting the
    claimant's son to leave the UK.


10. In MA(Pakistan) it was explained that the concept of reasonableness is
    not limited to a focus on the child and that it brings back into play
    all potentially relevant public interest considerations, including the
    conduct of a child's parents. See MA (Pakistan) at [88]: "the conduct
    of the parents is relevant to their own situation which bears upon the
    wider public interest and does not amount to blaming the children even
    if they may be prejudiced as a result".


11. Accordingly, the fact that the claimant has been in the UK unlawfully
    is relevant to the question of whether it would be unreasonable to
    expect her son to leave the UK.


12. However, unlike the children of the appellants in MA (Pakistan), the
    claimant's son is a British citizen. The Secretary of State has
    Guidance on the reasonableness of removing British citizen children.
    See paragraph 11.2.3 of the Immigration Directorate Instruction -
    Family Migration - Appendix FM, Section 1.0(B) "Family Life as a
    Partner or Parent and Private Life, 10 year Routes" dated August 2015
    (which is referred to in the recent Upper Tribunal decision SF and
    others [2017] UKUT 120 (IAC)).


13. This Guidance makes clear that it would ordinarily be unreasonable to
    expect a British citizen child to leave the UK.  It states that a
    decision to refuse to grant leave is only likely to be appropriate
    where the child would be able to remain in the UK and the conduct of
    the parent gives rise to consideration of such weight as to justify
    separation. The examples given are criminality and a very poor
    immigration history such as where there have been repeated and
    deliberate breaches of the Immigration Rules. Although the claimant has
    remained in the UK without lawful leave, she cannot properly be
    categorised as someone who has engaged in repeated and deliberate
    breaches of the Immigration Rules.


14. Accordingly, following the Secretary of State's guidance, it would be
    unreasonable to expect the claimant's son to leave the UK. As his
    removal is unreasonable, it follows that Article 8 would be infringed
    by the claimant being removed as Section 117B(6) stipulates that where
    the elements therein are satisfied there is no public interest in a
    person's removal. Adopting the formulation of Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan)
    at [20], because the answer to the first question under 117B(6) (is the
    claimant liable to deportation?)  is no, and the answers to the other
    three questions (is the relationship genuine? is the child qualifying?
    is it unreasonable to expect the child to leave the UK?) are yes, the
    conclusion must be that Article 8 is infringed.


 Decision


  The appeal is allowed under Article 8 ECHR.
