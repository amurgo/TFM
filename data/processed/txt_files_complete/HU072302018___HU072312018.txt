For the Appellants:    Mr L Youssefian, Counsel instructed by  Adam  Bernard
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

1. By a decision promulgated on 8 March 2021, I found an error of law in
   the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge P S Aujla, itself promulgated
   on 20 February 2019, dismissing the Appellants' appeals against the
   Respondent's decisions dated 21 February 2018.  By those decisions, the
   Respondent refused the Appellants entry as the dependents of their
   mother, Georgina Asante ("the Sponsor").  My error of law decision is
   annexed hereto for ease of reference.


2. In my error of law decision, I also gave directions for the filing and
   service of further evidence on which the Appellants wished to rely and
   for skeleton arguments to be filed and served.  On 14 April 2021, the
   Appellants filed an appeal bundle consisting of a skeleton argument, the
   documents before Judge Aujla and additional documents.  I refer to
   documents in that bundle hereafter as [AB/xx].


3. My directions envisaged that the resumed hearing would take place on a
   face-to-face basis.  However, I was informed just before the hearing that
   the Sponsor had been directed to self-isolate and would not be able to
   attend in person.  It had been intended that she would give oral evidence
   at the hearing.  For that reason, the Tribunal set up a link via
   Microsoft Teams enabling the Sponsor to attend.

4. As it was, I did not need to hear evidence from the Sponsor as Mr Walker
   indicated that he did not have any questions for the Sponsor.  The
   Sponsor was asked questions about her current accommodation and earnings
   by Mr Youssefian.  Mr Walker then indicated that he accepted that the
   Appellants had made out their case on sole responsibility within the
   Immigration Rules ("the Rules").  He informed me that since the
   Respondent in these appeals is the Entry Clearance Officer, he was unable
   to concede the appeals entirely in the sense of agreeing to the grant of
   entry clearance.  Nonetheless, he did not oppose the appeals.


5. I confirmed that, in light of that concession, I would allow the appeals
   and would provide my decision in writing which I now turn to do.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION


6. I do not need to say much about the factual background to these appeals.
    I have summarised the facts at [2] and [3] of my error of law decision.
   The Appellants are now adults but made the applications which led to the
   decisions under challenge when they were still children.  As such, I need
   to consider those applications within the Rules as at the date of
   application.


7. Paragraph 297 of the Rules ("Paragraph 297") reads as follows so far as
   relevant:





      "Requirements for indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as the
      child of a parent, parents or a relative present and settled or being
      admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom

      297. The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave
      to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents or a
      relative present and settled or being admitted for settlement in the
      United Kingdom are that he:
      (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent, parents
      or a relative in one of the following circumstances:
         ...
         or
         (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
         being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had sole
         responsibility for the child's upbringing; or
         (f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in the United
         Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and
         there are serious and compelling family or other considerations
         which make exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable
         arrangements have been made for the child's care; and
    (ii) is under the age of 18; and
    (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a
civil partner, and has not      formed an independent family unit; and
    (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the parent, parents
    or relative the child is seeking to join without recourse to public
    funds in accommodation which the parent, parents or relative the child
    is seeking to join, own or occupy exclusively; and
    (v) can, and will, be maintained adequately by the parent, parents, or
    relative the child is seeking to join, without recourse to public
    funds; and
    (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this
capacity; and
    (vii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds for refusal."


8. Although I have cited Paragraph 297(i)(f) for completeness, the
   Appellants rely on Paragraph 297(i)(e).  As such the essential question
   is whether the Sponsor has (or had at the relevant time) sole
   responsibility for the Appellants.  There is no dispute that the
   Appellants' father plays no part in their lives.  The Appellants were
   left by the Sponsor in the care of her brother, Mr Kwabena Anane.  The
   issue to be determined therefore is whether responsibility at the time of
   the application was shared between the Sponsor and Mr Anane or whether
   the Sponsor had sole responsibility.


9. The Tribunal has provided guidance in relation to the assessment of sole
   responsibility in TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e): 'sole responsibility') Yemen
   [2006] UKAIT 00049 as follows:


    "'Sole responsibility' is a factual matter to be decided upon all the
    evidence. Where one parent is not involved in the child's upbringing
    because he (or she) had abandoned or abdicated responsibility, the
    issue may arise between the remaining parent and others who have day-to-
    day care of the child abroad. The test is whether the parent has
    continuing control and direction over the child's upbringing, including
    making all the important decisions in the child's life. However, where
    both parents are involved in a child's upbringing, it will be
    exceptional that one of them will have 'sole responsibility'".


10. Mr Walker has conceded that the evidence shows that the Sponsor had
   sole responsibility for the Appellants at the relevant time.  For
   completeness, I record what the evidence shows.


11. The Sponsor left the Appellants in the care of Mr Anane in 2011 when
   she came to the UK to marry her former husband, Mr Asante.  The Sponsor
   has one child with Mr Asante who is her second husband.  That child is
   British.  The Sponsor has indefinite leave to remain ("ILR").
12. The Sponsor's second marriage broke down as she became a victim of
   domestic violence.  Thereafter, her immigration status was precarious and
   she was reliant on State benefits so that she could not meet the entry
   clearance requirements.  She did not make an application for entry
   clearance for the Appellants until her situation was sorted.  The
   precariousness of her own situation at the time also prevented her from
   visiting the Appellants.  She was also prevented from so doing because
   her British child did not have a passport and she was unable to obtain
   one as the child's father had already applied for and been given one.


13.  The sponsor was granted ILR in February 2014.  She now works as a
   healthcare assistant with the NHS.  Her oral evidence is that she earns
   �20,000 plus benefits together totalling �26,552.  The applications which
   led to the decisions under appeal were made in November 2017 at which
   time both Appellants were still minors.


14. As part of the further evidence submitted on behalf of the Appellants,
   there is a letter from Mr Anane dated 31 March 2021 ([AB/237] which
   describes the arrangements made for care of the Appellants as follows:


    "I, Mr Kwabena Anane wish to inform you that Georgina Asante is my
    younger sister.  Before her departure to the United Kingdom we decided
    that her two kids Bernice Kumeah Yirenki and Emmanuel Larbi Yirenki
    should stay with me at my residence in Asare Botwe in the Adenta
    Municipal Assembly.
    Since 2011, I have been taking the day-to-day care of the kids such as,
        . Provide three meals a day for them
        . Ensure that they attend church services
        . Ensure they attend extra classes when they are on vacation
          holidays
        . Decide with the mother to choose a school for them
        . Do celebrate their birth days and,
        . Ensure they do not associate themselves with bad friends.
    However, their mother (Georgina Asante) is the sole sponsor for such
         purposes, that require
    money.
    Attached are samples of receipts of money sent to me."


15. That evidence tends to suggest that Mr Anane was responsible for some
   of the decision making in relation to the Appellants, such as choice of
   schools.  It will be recalled that the evidence about this was in some
   doubt at the time of the First-tier Tribunal hearing and was considered
   in my error of law decision.


16. Sole responsibility is not just about providing finance.  It is about
   responsibility for decisions taken about children.  The letter from Mr
   Anane might suggest that such responsibility was shared between him and
   the Sponsor.


17. I have however had regard to what is said in the witness statement of
   the Appellants about their mother's involvement in their lives as follows
   (taken from the First Appellant's statement at [AB/1(I)]):


       "..16. Appellant's mother keep sending them money for all their
       maintenance and expenses and remain in contact to look after them,
       but the appellants are insisting to be with their mother and are not
       ready to live without her anymore.
       17.    The appellant's guardian is worried and has no other
       alternative relative in Ghana to shift guardianship responsibility
       except mother.
       18.    Appellant's mother has always spent time on inquiring about
       friends and the associations we are living with, and also spend time
       inquiring about education from the teachers and the church if we are
       attending regularly.  She mostly have to approach our doctor to find
       out about health issues if any.  She has to spend most of her energy
       on our attention.
       19.    The appellant request that the honourable judge to consider
       that, the mother have to concentrate on our daily activities and
       have to make decisions where their guardian is not able to do so.
       We need our mother's patronage at every steps of our life.
       20.    The appellant's mother has to keep an eye on our clothings,
       food, daily routine, sleep which is one a loveable action by her and
       we always await to see her affection in such a way she performs in
       our life and this effect would be more better once we are united."


   The Second Appellant's statement is in identical terms.


18. Whilst the drafting of those statements leaves something to be desired
   in terms of professionalism and clarity, read with the letter from Mr
   Anane it appears that the Sponsor has had responsibility for decision
   making in relation to the Appellants' upbringing but Mr Anane has had day-
   to-day care for them and has made decisions in that regard.  Mr Anane's
   responsibility for the Appellants' day-to-day care however does not mean
   that the Sponsor has abdicated any of her responsibility for the
   Appellants' upbringing.  The issue is whether she has "continuing control
   and direction over [the Appellants'] upbringing, including making all the
   important decisions in [their lives]".


19. Based on the foregoing evidence and also on the other evidence showing
   regular communication between the Appellants and Sponsor and maintenance
   payments, and accepting Mr Walker's concession, I find that the Sponsor
   has (or had at the relevant time) sole responsibility for the Appellants.




20. That is not of course the end of the matter as the only ground of
   appeal on which I can allow the appeals is that the Respondent's
   decisions breach the Appellants' human rights.  I turn therefore to
   consider that issue.


21. I accept that the Appellants remain financially and emotionally
   dependent on the Sponsor.  There is ample evidence that she meets their
   financial needs and messages showing regular contact.  Notwithstanding
   the lack of face-to-face contact for a period of ten years (for the
   reasons I have set out above), and that the Appellants are now both
   adults, I am prepared to accept that the Appellants enjoy family life
   with the Sponsor and vice versa.


22. I also accept based on the statements of the Appellants and the Sponsor
   that they wish to continue that family life in person in the UK.
   Although that might be thought to go without saying, I am aware that, in
   the years between the applications for entry clearance and the hearing of
   these appeals, the Appellants have embarked on studies in their home
   country.  For example, the letter at [AB/316] shows that the First
   Appellant is enrolled in a degree programme which is not due to be
   completed until June 2023.  There will for that reason be some
   interference with the Appellants' private lives occasioned by their move
   to the UK.  They also have no familiarity with the UK never having
   visited this country.


23. Nonetheless, I accept that the interference with the Appellants' family
   lives if they are prevented from entering the UK is more significant.
   They have had no parental affection from their father throughout their
   lives.  It appears from their statements that they crave the affection of
   their mother and the opportunity to experience that affection at first
   hand rather than remotely.  Equally, as they say, the Sponsor has
   experienced hardship since coming to the UK, particularly having suffered
   domestic violence at the hands of her second husband.  She too will
   benefit from having her family in the UK with her.


24. Against that interference, I have to balance the public interest.  I
   have regard to the factors in Section 117B Nationality, Immigration and
   Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117B") so far as relevant.  The Appellants meet
   the Rules in the category in which they applied to enter.  There is
   therefore no public interest in refusal of entry based on the maintenance
   of effective immigration control (Section 117B(1)).  They have applied
   from outside the UK in accordance with the Rules and meet the Rules.


25. It appears from the Appellants' statements and communications with
   their mother that they are fluent in English.  They therefore satisfy
   Section 117B(2).


26. Mr Walker did not take any issue with the Sponsor's ability to maintain
   and accommodate the Appellants without recourse to public funds.
   Although that is a point raised in the Respondent's decisions under
   appeal based on lack of evidence, Mr Walker did not seek to challenge the
   evidence in this regard nor to suggest that the accommodation and
   earnings evidence was insufficient to show that the requirements are met.



27. The evidence in this regard appears at [AB/40-197] and although that is
   somewhat dated, it shows that the Sponsor remains renting under a secure
   tenancy a flat which can accommodate five persons.  At present, she lives
   there alone with her minor daughter.  It also shows that she earns
   broadly the amount she claims to earn and is in receipt of child benefits
   for her daughter.  Her bank statements show reasonably healthy balances
   and, as I have already pointed out, the Sponsor has been paying for the
   maintenance of the Appellants in Ghana so will be able to divert funds
   for their maintenance in the UK.  I am therefore satisfied that Section
   117B(3) is met.  In any event, the Appellants will not be entitled to
   have recourse to public funds under the Rules.


28. The remaining sub-sections of Section 117B have no bearing in these
   appeals.


29. Balancing the interference with, in particular, the Appellants' and
   Sponsor's family lives against the public interest, taking into account
   in particular the finding (and concession) that the Appellants meet the
   Rules for entry as the Sponsor's dependents, and having regard to Section
   117B, I am satisfied that the decisions to refuse the Appellants entry
   clearance amount to a disproportionate interference with their Article 8
   rights.


30. For those reasons, I allow the Appellants' appeals.

DECISION

The Respondent's decisions under appeal to refuse the Appellants entry
    clearance
amount to a disproportionate interference with the Appellants' Article 8
    rights and are
therefore in breach of section 6 Human Rights Act 1998.  The appeals are
    allowed on
human rights grounds.

Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr L Youssefian, Counsel instructed by  Adam  Bernard
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

   1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
      Judge P S Aujla promulgated on 20 February 2019 ("the Decision"). By
      the Decision, the Judge dismissed the Appellants' appeals against the
      Respondent's decisions dated 21 February 2018 (maintained on 21
      November 2018) refusing them entry as the children of their mother,
      Georgina Asante ("the Sponsor"), who is settled in the UK.


   2. The Appellants are nationals of Ghana.  They are now aged respectively
      twenty-one years and nineteen years.  The applications for entry
      clearance were made in November 2017 when they were respectively just
      under eighteen and sixteen years.  The Sponsor, also a national of
      Ghana, came to the UK in 2011 to join her husband and gave birth in
      2012 to a child who is a British citizen.  The Sponsor was granted
      indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") in February 2014.

   3. When the Sponsor left Ghana, the Appellants were left in the care of
      the Sponsor's brother ("the Guardian").  The Sponsor sent money to the
      Guardian for the Appellants' upkeep.  She has not visited them in
      Ghana since she left.

   4. The Respondent refused the applications on the basis that she was not
      satisfied that the Sponsor had sole responsibility for the Appellants
      and that there were no serious and compelling family or other
      considerations which made their exclusion undesirable.  The Respondent
      therefore concluded that the Appellants could not meet paragraph 297
      of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules").

   5. The Judge did not accept as credible some of the Sponsor's evidence.
      He too concluded that, whilst the Sponsor might have been financially
      responsible for the Appellants, it was the Guardian who was
      responsible for their upbringing.  He concluded at [30] of the
      Decision that, "[a]t best, it was a case of responsibility for the
      Appellants' upbringing shared between the sponsor and her brother".
      He also found that "there was no credible evidence before [him] that
      could remotely suggest that there were serious and compelling family
      or other considerations which made the Appellant [sic] exclusion from
      the United Kingdom undesirable" ([31]).  The Judge found that Article
      8 ECHR was not engaged and therefore dismissed the human rights
      grounds ([32] and [33]).

   6. The Appellants appeal on three grounds as follows:

     1) The Judge has materially misdirected himself as to the facts or has
        failed to take into account material facts.  The Appellants rely in
        this regard on Counsel's note of the proceedings and the evidence
        there recorded.
     2) The Judge has adopted a wrong approach to the issue of sole
        responsibility.
     3) The delay in promulgation of the Decision renders it unsafe.

   7. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge
      on 12 June 2020.  Following detailed reasoning, she concluded as
      follows:


         "..4.    I find that there is no arguable merit in the grounds.
         The matters raised in the grounds are an argument for a different
         interpretation of the assertive evidence which was presented.  None
         of the evidence was determinative of the issues.  The judge's
         conclusions were open on the evidence.  The evidence about the
         schooling has been isolated in these grounds, but reading the
         decision and the grounds it is clear that the judge was entitled to
         find that the brother was involved in the decision making process,
         and the brother's formal status as guardian carried weight.  The
         evidence of the sponsor taking responsibility for the children
         since she left was limited.  The judge has done sufficient to
         explain to the Appellants why their appeals did not succeed."


   8. On renewal of the application to this Tribunal, permission was granted
      by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker on 7 August 2020 in the following terms:


         "It is arguable, for the reasons set out in the grounds relied
         upon, that the FtT judge erred in law in failing to provide
         adequate reasons for adverse findings made, making significant
         errors of fact and failing to properly consider the issue of sole
         responsibility."


   9. Judge Coker gave directions permitting the parties to make further
      submissions in writing.  The Respondent filed a Rule 24 reply on 1
      October 2020, seeking to uphold the Decision on the basis that Judge
      Aujla had properly directed himself and that the grounds were mere
      disagreements with the findings which were open to the Judge on the
      evidence.


  10. So it is that the matter comes before me to determine whether the
      Decision contains an error of law and, if I so conclude, to either re-
      make the decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do
      so.  The hearing was listed to be heard remotely.  Neither party
      objected to that course.  The hearing was attended by representatives
      for both parties.  There were no technical issues affecting the course
      of the hearing.

  11. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Walker indicated that he was content
      that there was an error of law in the Decision.  In the course of
      discussions with both representatives, I accepted that there was an
      error of law identified by ground one.  It was agreed that the
      Decision would need to be set aside.


  12. The representatives accepted, following discussions, that the appeal
      could remain for redetermination in this Tribunal.  It is not
      necessary to remit it.  There are few issues of credibility and the
      appeal turns mainly on an assessment of the documentary evidence and
      oral evidence of the Sponsor.   Although Mr Youssefian initially
      indicated that it might be possible to re-make the decision based on
      the documentary evidence and the oral evidence of the Sponsor recorded
      in the Decision, I did not consider that to be a viable proposition
      since ground one raised by the Appellants took issue with the accuracy
      of some of what is recorded as being the Sponsor's evidence.
      Moreover, the First-tier Tribunal hearing took place over two years
      ago (as to which see below).  Although updating evidence might not be
      necessary in relation to the issue under the Rules as a Judge has to
      consider whether the Sponsor had sole responsibility for the
      Appellants at the time when the application was made, such evidence
      might be relevant to the Article 8 ECHR issue which is of course the
      only actual ground of appeal.


  13. I therefore gave directions for further evidence and skeleton
      arguments orally and indicated that I would provide my reasons in
      writing for finding an error of law in the Decision which I now turn
      to do.

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

   GROUND THREE

  14. I can deal very shortly with ground three.  Although I accept as
      indicated in the grounds that the Decision reached the Appellants only
      in March 2020, that was a re-promulgation, it appears as a result of
      it being accepted that it was not received on the first occasion it
      was sent.  The Decision on file shows that it was signed by the Judge
      on 7 February 2019 (the day after the hearing) and promulgated for the
      first time on 20 February 2019 (about two weeks after the hearing).
      There was therefore no delay in the writing of the Decision, and it
      cannot be said that the delay in the Appellants receiving the Decision
      has rendered it unsafe (see SS (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1391).

   GROUNDS ONE AND TWO

  15. The focus of grounds one and two is the evidence recorded at [23] to
      [29] of the Decision and the Judge's findings and conclusion in that
      regard.  That passage of the Decision reads as follows:


         "23. The sponsor came to the United Kingdom on 10 December 2011
         when the Appellants were 11 years 10 months and 10 years old
         respectively.  She came to United Kingdom to live with her husband.
          There was no evidence before me why the children's father was not
         involved in their upbringing if that was the case and no
         information about him whatsoever.  Regardless of that, there was no
         evidence before me to show why the sponsor and her then husband did
         not make efforts to bring the Appellants to the United Kingdom,
         before her marriage fell apart, especially as the Appellant claimed
         that her ex-husband was also sending remittances for their
         maintenance.
         24.  The sponsor was granted indefinite leave to remain on 12
         February 2014.  The Appellants still did not apply for entry
         clearance to come to the United Kingdom until November 2017 when
         they were 17 years 9 months and 15 years 10 months old
         respectively.  By then they had become near adults before the
         sponsor decided to sponsor them.  Even if she was in receipt of
         benefits between 2012 and 2016, she had found employment in
         November 2016.  She still did not apply for the children to come to
         the UK until November 2017.  Whilst I accept that she had built up
         some employment record before she sponsored them, her failure to
         bring the children to the United Kingdom before her marriage fell
         apart and the delay in making the application after she found
         employment counted against her claim that she had sole
         responsibility for the children's upbringing.
         25.  Furthermore, and most importantly, the sponsor was granted
         indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom on 12 February
         2014.  She had been absent from the Appellants' lives since 10
         December 2011 while they were going through their formative years
         and needed most support and input from the sponsor as their mother
         who was, on her evidence, the only parent responsible for then.
         The Appellant made no efforts whatsoever to pay a visit to Ghana to
         see the children.  I do not believe for a moment that, even if her
         account was believed, she would not have visited them, even once if
         she had sole responsibility for their upbringing.  Even if her
         brother was doing a good job in bringing them up I would have
         expected her to have had contact with the children at a level much
         higher than she had claimed, even visiting them at least once if
         not more often, as evidence of her concern about their well-being
         and in exercise of her sole responsibility.  She had been absent
         from the children's life for six years before they made the
         application.  There was no credible evidence before me of concerned
         and regular contact by the sponsor with the Appellants.
         26.  I carefully observed the sponsor giving evidence.  It was
         clear to me from her demeanour that she was making up the answers
         as she went along.  She talked about the children's ambition of
         studying medicine and law after their arrival and yet she was not
         able to put any evidence before me as to their current level of
         education standards and how they had become so familiar with the
         university system in the United Kingdom.  She was even sure that
         her son would go to South Bank University to study law.  It was
         clear to me that she was simply making up the evidence.
         27.  The sponsor stated that she was financially supporting the
         children from the time that she had come to the UK.  She stated
         that she was sending �500 a month.  When it came to light that she
         was on benefits for 4 years between 2012 and 2016, I asked her to
         explain how she was able to send �500 a month during that period.
         I intervened because there was an obvious discrepancy in her
         evidence and I wished to give her the opportunity of providing an
         explanation if she had one.  It was at that point of time that Mr
         Youssefian accused me of descending into the arena and I explained
         to him my reasons for the intervention.  The sponsor then changed
         her evidence and stated that she was sending about �300 a month.
         28.  The sponsor stated that she chose the school for the
         Appellants.  She chose the particular school because she had
         attended that school herself.  She then made the most startling
         admission, that when she chose the school, if her brother did not
         agree they would look for a different school.  That admission
         clearly ran counter to her assertion that she had sole
         responsibility for the children's upbringing.  If the sponsor's
         brother had a say in choosing the school, the sponsor could not be
         solely responsible for choosing the Appellants' school.
         29.  Whilst I accept that the person did not have to be present at
         the scene to exercise sole responsibility for their children, each
         and every case had to be looked at in view of its own particular
         circumstances.  The sponsor had almost abandoned her two children
         when they were very young and going through formative years.  She
         came to the United Kingdom.  She had been absent from their lives
         for six years when the application was made and seven years by now.
          She was aware from the decision that the Respondent did not accept
         that she had sole responsibility.  The decision was made on 21
         February 2018, nearly a year ago.  Although the sponsor had been
         working since November 2016, she made no effort to visit the
         children, even after the Respondent's decision was made, as part of
         her exercise of sole responsibility.  She had indefinite leave to
         remain in the United Kingdom since 12 February 2014.  She had been
         in employment since November 2016.  She had not taken the trouble
         of paying even a single visit to Ghana to see the children.  If she
         was a concerned mother who was very much interested in their proper
         upbringing, it would be reasonable to expect her to visit Ghana to
         see the children, at least once.  She has waited until the children
         had become near adults which, as submitted by Mr Harvey, ran
         counter to her claim that she had sole responsibility for their
         upbringing."


  16. Based on the conclusions drawn from the evidence at [29] of the
      Decision, the Judge went on at [30] of the Decision to conclude that
      the Guardian had sole responsibility or, at best, that the Sponsor's
      responsibility was shared with the Guardian.


  17. Mr Youssefian was also the Appellants' representative in the First-
      tier Tribunal.  He produced his record of the proceedings, redacted
      for legal privilege.  He did not however provide a witness statement
      in support of that record nor did he ask to give evidence in that
      regard.  Of course, had he done so, the Appellants would have had to
      seek the assistance of another barrister to represent them as he could
      not both give evidence and act as advocate.


  18. Notwithstanding the failure properly to give evidence as to what
      occurred, I am satisfied that Mr Youssefian's record of proceedings is
      reasonably accurate since it largely accords with the Judge's own
      record which is on the file.


  19. There is one discrepancy in relation to the point about choice of
      schools.  Mr Youssefian's record indicates that, when asked what would
      have happened if the Guardian disagreed with the Sponsor's choice, she
      replied that he had agreed with her whereas the Judge's note is as
      recorded in the Decision that she said that, if he disagreed, they
      would have looked for another school.  I am unable to decide on the
      evidence which of those two alternatives is the correct one.  The
      Appellants have failed however to show that Mr Youssefian's record is
      the accurate one.


  20. Fortunately, I do not need to need to resolve that dispute.  I accept
      the criticism made of the Judge's comment about the Sponsor's evidence
      regarding the Appellants' future in the UK.  Both records of
      proceedings show that her evidence was based on a conversation she had
      with the Appellants regarding their intentions and where they would
      wish to study.  Those intentions were formulated by the Appellants
      themselves who are of course now adults based on their own online
      research. Neither record of the evidence indicates that she was making
      her answers up as she went along.


  21. Further, the reason why Mr Walker conceded on this ground is due to
      what is said about the lack of visits by the Sponsor to see the
      Appellants in Ghana and the delay in making the entry clearance
      applications.  These issues are a major focus of the Judge's reasoning
      albeit I would accept those are not the only factors on which his
      conclusions are based.


  22. As indicated at [7] of the grounds, the Sponsor gave two reasons for
      the delay in making the application.  She made the applications one
      year after starting work.  As she points out, that is not an
      inordinately long period.  Moreover, she points out that she had to
      pay for two applications not just one.  She therefore said that she
      needed to save to pay the fees.  The second reason was that her
      marriage in the UK broke down due to domestic violence.  She said that
      she could not bring her children to the UK whilst that issue was
      unresolved.


  23. Paragraph [8] of the grounds sets out the three reasons why the
      Sponsor had not visited the Appellants in Ghana.  First, her domestic
      violence case was ongoing from her separation in 2013 until 2015.
      Second, thereafter, she needed to get her life in order before going
      to see the children.  Third, having obtained employment in November
      2016, she was unable to visit.


  24. Whether all of those are or are not cogent reasons for failing to make
      the applications sooner or not visiting the Appellants before the
      applications were made or since is not something I have to decide at
      this stage.  The fact is that the Judge has failed to have regard to
      the domestic violence background to the breakdown of the Sponsor's
      marriage; in the findings, he records only that the marriage had
      fallen apart.  There is one brief reference to the Sponsor's evidence
      in that regard at [18] of the Decision and to a submission that the
      Sponsor could not bring the Appellants to the UK sooner for that
      reason, but it is not taken into account in the Judge's reasoning on
      the evidence.  The domestic violence history is recorded in a
      Metropolitan Police letter dated 10 April 2014 at [AB/37-39].


  25. It was the Judge's failure to have regard to the evidence about the
      domestic violence endured by the Sponsor which gave rise to Mr
      Walker's concession that an error was identified in the Decision on
      ground one.  I accept that the concession was rightly made.


  26. That concession having been made and accepted, I do not strictly need
      to go on to consider ground two.  I do so for the sake of
      completeness.  The Judge had regard to the Sponsor's evidence that she
      had prevented the Appellants going on a school trip and had chosen
      their school for religious and personal reasons ([17] of the
      Decision).  Although the Judge did not refer to the evidence about the
      school trip at [28] of the Decision, he did refer to the evidence
      about choice of school which was the most important but, as indicated
      above, based on his record of the Sponsor's evidence found it most
      striking that the Sponsor said that she would have looked at an
      alternative school if the Guardian disagreed.  Based on the evidence
      the Judge recorded and the lack of sufficient evidence that the
      Sponsor gave a different answer to that recorded by the Judge, I would
      not have found any error in that regard.


  27. Nor would I have found any error in the Judge's analysis of the
      Sponsor's financial responsibility for the Appellants given his
      reasoning on this aspect at [27] of the Decision.  There is therefore
      no failure to follow the guidance given in  TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e):
      "sole responsibility" Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049 ("TD").


  28. Neither do I accept the interpretation which the Appellants seek to
      place on the guidance given in TD at [15] of the grounds.  The
      guidance reads as follows:

         "Sole responsibility" is a factual matter to be decided upon all
         the evidence. Where one parent is not involved in the child's
         upbringing because he (or she) had abandoned or abdicated
         responsibility, the issue may arise between the remaining parent
         and others who have day-to-day care of the child abroad. The test
         is whether the parent has continuing control and direction over the
         child's upbringing, including making all the important decisions in
         the child's life. However, where both parents are involved in a
         child's upbringing, it will be exceptional that one of them will
         have 'sole responsibility'".


  29. As that guidance makes clear, there is no presumptive starting point
      when only one parent is involved in a child's upbringing.  Where
      another person who is not the other parent is or may be involved in
      that child's upbringing in the child's home country, the issue of sole
      responsibility falls to be resolved on all the facts as between the
      parent who is not physically present in the home country and that
      other person based on the evidence of "control and direction" over the
      child's upbringing.  That is the exercise which the Judge conducted.
      I would have upheld the Judge's findings and conclusion based on that
      guidance had it not been for the failures to have regard to relevant
      evidence as identified above.


  30. For the reasons I have given above, however, I am satisfied that an
      error of law in the Decision is disclosed by the Appellant's ground
      one (as conceded by the Respondent).  For that reason, I set aside the
      Decision.  As already indicated, I have given directions for the re-
      making of the decision by this Tribunal.  Those are set out below.

   CONCLUSION


  31. For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that ground one discloses an
      error of law in the Decision.  I therefore set aside the Decision and
      give directions below for the re-making of the Decision.



   DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


   The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge P S Aujla promulgated on 20
   February 2019 (and re-promulgated on 11 March 2020) involves the making
   of an error on a point of law.  I therefore set aside the Decision and
   give directions for the re-making of the decision in this Tribunal as
   follows:

   1) Within 28 days from the date when this decision is sent, the
      Appellants shall file with the Tribunal and serve on the Respondent
      any further evidence on which they seek to rely.


   2) Within 14 days from the filing and service of any evidence in [1]
      above, the Appellants shall file with the Tribunal and serve on the
      Respondent a skeleton argument setting out the issues for the Tribunal
      to determine and any case-law relied upon.


   3) Within 14 days from the filing and service of the Appellants' skeleton
      argument at [2] above, the Respondent shall file with the Tribunal and
      serve on the Appellants her written submissions in response.


   4) The appeal will be listed for re-hearing on a face-to-face basis on
      the first available date after two months from the sending of this
      decision (time estimate � day).  No interpreter is required.  In the
      event that the Appellants wish to proceed via a remote hearing rather
      than a face-to-face hearing, they must inform the Tribunal and the
      Respondent accordingly within 14 days from the date when this decision
      is sent.

   5) Documents or submissions filed in response to these directions may  be
      sent by, or attached to, an email  to  [email]  using  the  Tribunal's
      reference number (found at the top of these directions) as the subject
      line.  Attachments must  not  exceed  15  MB.   This  address  is  not
      generally available for the filing of documents which should  continue
      to be sent by post.

   6) Service on the Secretary of  State  may  be  to  [email]  and  on  the
      Appellant, in the absence of any contrary instruction, by use  of  any
      address apparent from the service of these directions.


   7) The parties have liberty to apply to the Tribunal for further
      directions or variation of the above directions, giving reasons if
      they face significant difficulties in complying.
