                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:      no appearance
For the Respondent:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Presenting Officer


                         NOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL


 1. This is an appeal against a determination by First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    A M Baker, promulgated on 19 March 2013.

 2. The appellant did not appear on 30 July 2013 and was  not  represented,
    but his solicitors had confirmed in advance that the Upper Tribunal did
    not consider attendance necessary.

 3. By letter from his solicitors dated 25 July 2013 the  appellant  sought
    to "abandon his appeal".

 4. The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  do  not  appear  to
    provide for abandonment, but I treat the  letter  as  if  referring  to
    withdrawal, which requires the consent of the Tribunal.

 5. In terms of Rule 17, the appeal is recorded as having  been  withdrawn,
    with the consent of the Upper Tribunal.  The determination of the First-
    tier Tribunal therefore stands.
