                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Iqbal ('the Judge'), issued on  11  March  2019,  by  which  an  appeal
    against the respondent's decision not to issue  the  appellant  with  a
    residence card confirming that he enjoyed a retained right of residence
    was dismissed.

Anonymity

 2. No direction has been previously made, and there is no reason  for  one
    to be now issued.

Background

 3. The appellant is a national of  Pakistan.  He  married  a  national  of
    Lithuania, Ms. Naringa Jankauskaite, on 11 October 2012 and was  issued
    with an EEA residence card valid from 28 August 2014 to 28 August 2019.
    The appellant initiated divorce proceedings and a decree  absolute  was
    issued on 27 April 2017. On 15 February 2018, the appellant applied for
    a residence card confirming  his  retained  rights  of  residence.  The
    respondent refused the application by way of a decision dated  18  June
    2018 in which it was detailed:

           'We have determined that you do not have  a  retained  right  of
           residence in the UK following divorce from your EEA ... sponsor.
           In March 2014,  an  investigation  was  launched  into  a  money
           laundering operation being carried out by a Lithuanian national.
           This money laundering investigation  ran  alongside  a  criminal
           investigation and was  given  the  name  Operation  Jotaru.  The
           investigation was conducted by  an  Immigration  Officer  and  a
           Metropolitan Police Detective attached to the Home Office.


           The Lithuanian national, who will be referred to as  LTU  female
           1, was suspected of arranging  sham  marriages  between  females
           from Lithuania and non-EEA national males living in  the  United
           Kingdom.


           This investigation uncovered an organised  crime  network,  with
           links to Albanian drug traffickers and corrupt  solicitors.  The
           members of the crime group sourced  females  in  Lithuania,  who
           were often convinced to come to  the  United  Kingdom  with  the
           promise of obtaining a job in London. Some of the  females  were
           only made aware they would be expected to marry a male once they
           had arrived in the United Kingdom.


           The modus operandi of the gang was for a member of the  criminal
           group to source males who were either present illegally  in  the
           United Kingdom or whose visas were due shortly to expire.  These
           males would be given bank account details for various members of
           the crime group. Payment would then be made to the gang with LTU
           female 1 sourcing a flight for the female to come to the  United
           Kingdom, using a Hungarian based budget airline.


           The female would travel to Luton airport where she would be  met
           by members of the crime group. The female would then apply for a
           National Insurance number and in some  cases,  open  a  UK  bank
           account, in order to give the impression that they were  present
           in the United Kingdom, exercising their Treaty rights as an  EEA
           national.


           The female would return to Lithuania on a flight booked  by  the
           crime group. They would then return to the United Kingdom  again
           on a flight booked and  paid  for  by  the  crime  group  and  a
           registry office wedding would take place. The male  would  then,
           with the assistance of the crime group, make an application  for
           leave to remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse  of  an  EEA
           national.


           ... The male who had married the EEA national would be  expected
           to pay around �4,000 to �7,000 for this sham marriage service.


           ...


           Five members of the gang were arrested in August  and  September
           2014 and given police bail. This  was  a  lengthy  investigation
           with international enquiries carried out and  large  amounts  of
           electronical  material  and  media  devices  requiring  forensic
           analysis.


           All members of the crime group were charged  in  September  2015
           with 'Conspiracy to assist  unlawful  immigration'  contrary  to
           section 25(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 and 'Money laundering'
           contrary to sections 327 - 329 of  the  Proceeds  of  Crime  Act
           2002.


           ... Due to the scale of the investigation, it was  decided  with
           the Crown Prosecution Service to select a number of marriages to
           evidence and use these marriages to highlight to  the  jury  the
           criminality the gang were involved with.


           Twenty-six marriages were chosen, and they were  chosen  due  to
           the flows of money between the non-EU national male and  members
           of the  crime  group  and  evidenced  flight  booking  from  the
           airline's database.


           There is evidence of bank transactions between yourself and  the
           aforementioned crime group on the following  dates:  17/08/2012,
           03/09/2012, 11/09/2012.


           There is evidence of Neringa Jankauskaite flying to  the  UK  on
           flights paid for  by  LTU  female  1  on  the  following  dates:
           24/8/2012, 12/09/2012, 10/10/2012.


           The  marriage  of  yourself,  Muhammad  Umar  ...  and   Neringa
           Jankauskaite ... was one identified by the investigation team as
           being a sham marriage arranged purely to assist  you  to  obtain
           leave to remain in the United Kingdom.'

 4. A 'section 9 statement' authored by an Immigration  Officer,  dated  21
    May 2018, details the information above and confirms that  after  a  9-
    week trial held in 2017, five members of the crime group were convicted
    of assisting unlawful immigration and one member of  money  laundering.
    Four members received custodial sentences.


The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appeal was heard on 11 May 2019. The appellant was  represented  by
    Mr. Balroop, counsel, who observed that  no  exhibits  accompanied  the
    section 9 statement. Mr. Grennan,  for  the  respondent,  informed  the
    Judge that no  further  evidence  would  be  forthcoming,  and  it  was
    sufficient to rely upon a section 9 statement made for the purposes  of
    criminal proceedings. Mr. Balroop  confirmed  to  the  Judge  that  his
    instructing solicitors had made no request for copies for the  exhibits
    referred to within the section 9 statement prior  to  the  hearing.  No
    adjournment request was made by either party resulting in  the  hearing
    proceeding.

 6. The Judge found  that  the  evidence  relied  upon  by  the  respondent
    discharged the burden placed upon him  of  demonstrating  a  reasonable
    suspicion that the marriage was one of convenience. She then  proceeded
    to consider the totality  of  the  evidence  and  in  addition  to  the
    evidence contained within the section 9 statement she observed at [27],
    'Although it may be considered a whirlwind romance,  I  find  that  the
    dates from his entry to the United Kingdom in March 2011,  his  college
    closing down and then being unable to find another college, to  meeting
    his ex-spouse in 2012 and then subsequent marriage, is a time line that
    is highly convenient and further detracts from the credibility  of  the
    claimed relationship.' At [29] the Judge found  the  marriage  to  have
    been one of convenience and dismissed the appeal.


Grounds of appeal

 7. Grounds of appeal  were  drafted  by  Mr.  Balroop.  Three  grounds  of
    challenge were identified:

         i) The Judge erred in law in her approach to the section 9 evidence
             relied upon by the respondent, as the failure to  produce  the
             purportedly exhibited evidence meant that the  respondent  had
             not discharged the evidential  burden  initially  placed  upon
             him;


         ii)      The Judge made adverse findings on issues  that  were  not
             expressly put to the appellant; and


         iii)     The Judge acted unfairly in  requiring  the  appellant  to
             provide evidence as to the illness of the former wife's mother
             and by giving inadequate weight to the written evidence of the
             former wife and their former landlord.

 8. Permission to appeal was expressly granted on Ground 2 alone by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Birrell on 23  May  2019  in  accordance  with  the
    procedure identified by the President in Safi and Others (permission to
    appeal decisions) [2018] UKUT 00388 (IAC); [2019]  Imm  AR  437.  Judge
    Birrell observed, inter alia:

         'There is arguable merit in ground 2: it is arguable  that  if  the
         Judge has concerns about aspects of the appellant's account of  his
         marriage then he should have given the appellant the opportunity to
         address those concerns.


         There is no merit in the other two grounds. The Judge was  entitled
         to find that the respondent met the legal  burden  of  establishing
         the marriage was a sham given that there is  no  dispute  that  the
         defendants in the criminal case - in which it was asserted that the
         appellant's marriage was a sham - were convicted of the offences in
         question and therefore it is difficult  to  see  how  it  would  be
         argued that failure to produce  the  exhibits  (which  appeared  to
         relate to facts that were not in any event disputed)  was  material
         to the outcome. In relation to Ground 3 the Judge was  entitled  to
         give very little weight to evidence contained in witness statements
         where the witnesses did not attend court and there was no  evidence
         to support the reason given for non-attendance.'


The hearing

   I. Preliminary issue

 9. At the outset of the hearing, Ms. Joshi  sought  to  amend  grounds  by
    means of a skeleton argument dated 13 June 2019, which  reached  us  on
    the morning of the hearing. She asserted that the amendment was nuanced
    in relation to Ground 1, though we find that it constitutes  an  effort
    to raise several issues which were not expressly raised in the  earlier
    grounds of appeal. We observe that Joshi Advocates Ltd came  on  record
    on 5 June 2019 and no adequate reason was given for the late filing and
    service of the skeleton argument. Mr. Lindsay  had  no  notice  of  the
    request to amend grounds until the morning of the hearing.

10. The request was for  the  Tribunal  to  exercise  its  case  management
    powers: rule 5 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    ('the Procedure Rules') and permit the appellant to amend Ground  1  so
    as to incorporate a wide-ranging challenge  to  the  Judge's  decision.
    Several grounds of challenge are identified within 'amended Ground  1',
    including a ground that the respondent  had  provided  no  evidence  to
    connect 'LTU female 1' with any of the five persons convicted following
    trial;  no  evidence  was  filed  detailing  to  whom  the  money   was
    transferred and whether this was a gang member subsequently  convicted;
    no evidence as to the number of charges was provided to the  Judge  and
    no confirmation was provided as to whether the charges related  to  the
    three transactions made by the appellant to Ms. Jankauskaite's  friend;
    and further that the Judge could not have lawfully determined that  the
    burden of proof transferred from the respondent to the appellant.

11. The skeleton argument further details as to the amended ground:

         'The only connection between the  appellant/EEA  sponsor  and  this
         criminal matter is that the EEA sponsor travelled via Whizz Air and
         that the appellant paid for her  ticket  via  a  third  party  (EEA
         sponsor's friend's boyfriend) who may or may not be the  associated
         member of the gang involved in criminal activities  with  the  said
         crime gang, but given the absence  of  evidence  it  is  remote  to
         connect  the  appellant's  marriage   to   the   criminal   matters
         particularly as it is unclear whether the charges against the  gang
         members  related  to  the  appellant's  transactions,  whether  the
         associated person was charged/convicted.'

12. By way of rule 5(3)(c) of the Procedural Rules the Tribunal may  permit
    an appellant to amend the notice of appeal. Rule 2 establishes that the
    overriding objective is that this Tribunal deals with cases fairly  and
    justly, which includes dealing with a case in  a  way  that  is,  inter
    alia, proportionate to the importance of the case, avoiding  delay  and
    being aware of anticipated costs. Rule 2(4) provides that parties to an
    appeal are obliged to help  the  Tribunal  to  further  the  overriding
    objective.

13. We observe that the appellant was aware that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    had refused him permission to appeal on Grounds 1 and 3 by way  of  its
    decision of 23 May 2019. The appellant enjoyed a right to apply to  the
    Upper Tribunal to seek permission to appeal the refused grounds  within
    14 days after the date on which the First-tier  Tribunal's  notice  was
    sent to him: rule 21(3)(a)(i) of the Procedure Rules. Such time expired
    on 6 June 2019, after Joshi Advocates Ltd came on record. No such paper
    application was made. We further note that in NA (UT rule 45;  Singh  v
    Belgium) Iran [2014] UKUT 00205 (IAC), at [4], a  former  President  of
    this Tribunal refused to accede to a request to consider all grounds in
    circumstances where permission  to  appeal  was  granted  on  a  narrow
    ground, the application was inexplicably made without notice and if the
    request had been granted  it  would  have  inevitably  resulted  in  an
    adjournment with delay and resulting costs.

14. We refused the application to amend  the  appellant's  grounds  at  the
    hearing. We were mindful of the overriding objective but  observed  the
    failure to exercise a right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal by way of a
    paper application. Ms. Joshi sought to rely upon her  late  entry  into
    these proceedings, but we noted at the hearing that the  appellant  had
    enjoyed legal representation at the date of  Judge  Birrell's  decision
    and that time in which to bring an appeal was still  running  when  she
    came on record. Ms. Joshi could provide no adequate reason  as  to  why
    such step was not taken, in  circumstances  where  the  Upper  Tribunal
    would not proceed with consideration of the substantive appeal where an
    in-time application for permission to appeal remained outstanding:  see
    Safi, at [16]. The application amounted to a very late, without notice,
    effort to significantly amend the underlying nature of  the  appeal  in
    circumstances that were unfair to the respondent. We found it was  just
    and fair for the hearing to proceed on Ground 2 alone.


  II. Submissions

15. As to Ground 2, Ms. Joshi criticised the Judge for not  adjourning  the
    matter of her own volition if she were concerned as to  the  inadequacy
    of Ms. Jankauskaite's evidence  as  to  her  inability  to  attend  the
    hearing  due  to  her  mother's  illness.  Given  the  gravity  of  the
    respondent's evidence, there was a burden upon the Judge to permit  the
    appellant to address all elements of concern as to the marriage.

16. Mr. Lindsay resisted the appeal. In simple terms, the appellant was  on
    notice as to the case against him and there was no error in  the  Judge
    deciding that the appellant had failed to properly address such issues.
    The appellant was aware that if the burden were to  shift  to  him,  he
    would have to establish the  circumstances  of  his  marriage  and  its
    subsequent breakdown to the Tribunal's satisfaction.  The  findings  at
    [23] to [26] simply confirm that the appellant failed as  a  matter  of
    law to meet the burden placed upon him.

17. In reply, Ms. Joshi accepted that the former representatives could have
    explored matters in  more  detail,  but  the  appellant  was  penalised
    because of their failure. Though his former wife has sought to  support
    him by way of emailed evidence, the Judge should have been mindful that
    the appellant could  not  meet  the  burden  placed  upon  him  if  Ms.
    Jankauskaite was unable to provide more detailed evidence.


Decision on error of law

18. Ground 2 details at [8] - [10] of the appellant's grounds:

         'The FtT then proceeded  to  assess  the  appellant's  explanation,
         however the FtT made adverse findings without putting the issue  to
         the appellant.


         At paragraph 23 the FtT states, '... I find that the appellant  has
         failed to explain why he would have taken such an  active  role  in
         attempting to find her employments in the UK ...' the FtT continued
         at paragraph 26 '... I have no information  before  me  as  to  the
         breakdown of the marriage.'


         The appellant gave evidence however these issues were  not  put  to
         the appellant at any stage. It is  trite  law  that  the  appellant
         should be given  the  opportunity  to  respond  before  an  adverse
         finding is made. The FtT failed to give him that opportunity.'

19. The paragraphs of the Judge's decision complained of,  [23]  and  [26],
    detail in full:

         'I find the appellant has failed to explain why he would have taken
         such an active role in attempting to find her employment in the UK,
         when he barely knew her, or indeed pay for her  ticket  to  return,
         such that I am satisfied on balance  that  these  matters  detracts
         from the credibility of his claim. The appellant's explanation  for
         his ex-spouse returning to Lithuania on several occasions was  that
         her mother was a cancer patient. As  I  have  already  highlighted,
         there are two emails from his  ex-spouse  in  which,  I  note,  she
         confirms the appellant's account of how they met and in relation to
         the tickets that were bought. Further, she was unable to attend  as
         she was looking after her mother.'


         ...


         In addition, I have considered the fact that I have no  information
         before me as to the reasons for the breakdown of the marriage  save
         for  the  mention  that  there  were  some  marriage  difficulties.
         Further, I have noted  that  the  appellant's  immigration  history
         demonstrates that soon after arrival in 2011,  his  college  closed
         down and whilst he complained to the Home Office and  searched  for
         another college, it was at this time he met  and  married  his  ex-
         spouse.'

20. The respondent's refusal decision dated 18 June 2018 clearly placed the
    appellant on notice that the marriage  was  considered  to  be  one  of
    convenience and that Ms. Jankauskaite had sought to give an  impression
    that she was present in the United Kingdom exercising  relevant  Treaty
    rights when she continued to reside in Lithuania. The appellant  sought
    to explain at [7] of his witness statement dated 5 February 2019:

         'I can confirm that after meeting each other for the first time  we
         always stayed in touch with each other and even after my  ex-spouse
         left the UK on temporary basis to  see  her  mother.  It  was  also
         during this period that I found a nail technician job for  her  and
         informed her about the same. My ex-spouse was very  happy  to  hear
         that I found a job for her. However, she informed me that  she  has
         first to arrange the money for ticket and only then she can come. I
         really wanted to help my ex-spouse as I really liked her  and  also
         due to her mother's medical condition. It  was  therefore  in  this
         context that I offered to buy her ticket  for  coming  to  the  UK.
         However, due to my poor knowledge of airports I was unable to  book
         her ticket. It was therefore in  this  premise  that  my  ex-spouse
         requested me to transfer the money to her  friend's  boyfriend  who
         would be able to book the ticket for her. As a result of the  same,
         I transferred the money into given bank account with the particular
         reference namely 'ticket'. I can confirm that I never knew  or  had
         met my ex-spouse's friend's boyfriend who booked her tickets. I can
         further confirm neither my ex-spouse nor myself  were  involved  in
         any of the activities performed  by  this  group  at  all.  My  ex-
         spouse's flight booking were made entirely unintentionally for  all
         the above-mentioned reasons.'

21. Contrary to the allegation made within Ground 2, the appellant was  not
    only on notice that the respondent did not accept that Ms. Jankauskaite
    was working in this country, but he sought to address the issue by  way
    of his witness statement. Upon applying the correct burden and standard
    of proof, the Judge did not accept his evidence. We find that there  is
    no substance in the assertion that the appellant was not made aware  of
    this issue during the course of the hearing.

22. We further find that there is no merit to Ms. Joshi's  submission  that
    the Judge should have adjourned the hearing so that the appellant could
    file and serve further evidence as to the reasons for the breakdown  of
    his marriage. The appellant was  aware  that  the  respondent  did  not
    accept the genuineness of the marriage and he enjoyed some seven months
    from receipt of the respondent's decision  to  his  appeal  hearing  in
    which to prepare for his appeal. His witness statement runs to  over  3
    pages and the breakdown is simply detailed at  [12]  as,  'In  2016,  I
    started to encounter marital problems with my ex-spouse as a result  of
    which my marriage broke down conclusively on 27 April 2017  by  way  of
    divorce.' The burden rests upon the appellant to establish his case and
    the Judge cannot be criticised for not adjourning the appeal on her own
    motion so as to permit the remedying of failings in the presentation of
    evidence, particularly in circumstances where  the  appellant  and  his
    representatives have not sought such adjournment.

23. The Judge considered the  evidence  presented  to  her  in  the  round,
    undertook a careful assessment and gave clear and lawful  reasons  that
    are unimpeachable in the circumstances. The hearing was conducted in  a
    fair manner and the appellant cannot meritoriously assert that  he  was
    not put on notice of issues that were adverse to him.
