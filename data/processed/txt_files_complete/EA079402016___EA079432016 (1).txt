                     DECISION BY CONSENT AND DIRECTIONS

Decision by Consent

 1. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

    Upon the parties' prior agreement that the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal promulgated on 22nd August 2017 discloses a material error  of
    law, it is hereby ordered by consent as follows:

         Directions

          i) The Resident Judge made errors  of  law  in  relation  to  the
             dismissal of the appeal for want of jurisdiction and/or  other
             grounds in light of the Court of Appeal's subsequent  decision
             in Khan v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  &  Anor
             [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 and  in  light  of  the  Supreme  Court's
             recent judgment on 14th February 2018 of SM (Algeria) v  Entry
             Clearance Officer (UK visas section) [2018] UKSC 9.

         ii) The decision is set aside in its  entirety  with  no  findings
             preserved.

        iii) The matter is to be remitted to be heard by  a  Judge  of  the
             First-tier Tribunal other than Resident Judge Zucker.

 2. The Appellants' appeal in the Upper Tribunal is therefore allowed.  The
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  for  legal  error  by
    consent.

Anonymity

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


Signed                                  Date 22/03/2018

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Saini
