                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Appellant in relation to
    a decision and reasons of Immigration Judge Parkes promulgated on  28th
    November 2018 following a hearing at Birmingham.  The  Appellant  is  a
    lady of Afghan nationality who had applied to remain on the basis  that
    she was a spouse of a British citizen.  She  applied  on  human  rights
    grounds under Appendix FM.  The application was  refused  on  financial
    grounds and the Secretary of State also  decided  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles  to  the  Appellant  and  her  British  spouse
    enjoying family life in Afghanistan.

 2. The judge in considering human rights found that the  relationship  was
    genuine and subsisting, found at paragraph 14 that it was not  possible
    to enjoy their family life in Afghanistan but did find that they  could
    enjoy family life  in  India  on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had
    previously lived there.  India as an option was not  mentioned  in  the
    refusal letter, does not appear to have been mentioned or  relied  upon
    by the Secretary of State at the hearing  and  indeed  I  have  seen  a
    letter from UNHCR dated 30th  June  2015  indicating  that  whilst  the
    Appellant had been recognised by UNHCR in India as a refugee,  she  had
    withdrawn that on the basis that she was coming to the UK.   The  judge
    therefore made an error of law in considering return to India when that
    was not put to the Appellant, was not raised by the Presenting  Officer
    and indeed on the basis of the letter from UNHCR would appear to be not
    possible in any event.  The judge having  found  that  they  could  not
    enjoy family life in Afghanistan which is the only option open to them,
    the Appellant was clearly entitled to succeed in  this  appeal  on  the
    basis of EX.1 of Appendix FM.

 3.  I therefore set aside the decision of Judge Parkes on the basis of the
    error of law concerning return to India  and  I  re-decide  it  on  the
    findings made by him, unchallenged by the Secretary of  State,  and  on
    the basis that family life cannot be enjoyed in Afghanistan,  and  thus
    cannot be enjoyed outside the UK, the Appellant is entitled to succeed.
    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

    No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  to  make  a
whole fee award of ï¿½140 for the following  reason.   The  Appellant  clearly
met the requirements of Ex.1(b).
