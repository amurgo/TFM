For the Appellant:     Mr Stedman, Counsel instructed by Michael Rose
Baylis Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born on the 28th May 2000. She
    has lived in the United Kingdom since she arrived here with her  mother
    on the 24th October 2010, and now she would  like  to  stay  here.  She
    submits that it would  be  a  disproportionate  interference  with  her
    private life, as protected by Article 8 of the European Convention,  to
    expect her to leave now.

 2. The Appellant's human rights claim was rejected, along with those  made
    by her parents, on the 22nd July  2019.    The  family  pursued  linked
    appeals, all of which were dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Alis
    on the 1st October 2019.   All three sought permission to  appeal,  but
    only the Appellant was successful, being granted  permission  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Coker on the 26th February 2020.

 3. The written grounds of appeal are that in  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    human rights appeal Judge Alis erred in:

      a) Failing to give appropriate weight in the balancing exercise to  an
         earlier  injustice  visited  upon  the  Appellant  ('the   historic
         injustice' point)

      b) Failing to give reasons  for  the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant
         cannot today meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) ('the
         very significant obstacles' point)

      c) Failing to give appropriate weight to the fact that  the  Appellant
         had founded her private life in the United Kingdom as a child,  and
         had spent ten years' here ('the private life point').

 4. Before me  Mr  Stedman  declined  to  pursue  ground  (b).  He  further
    acknowledged that ground (a) may well be subsumed  by  ground  (c).  Mr
    McVeety for the Home Office opposed the appeal on all grounds.

    Ground (a): 'Historic Injustice'

 5. When the Appellant and her parents arrived in the United  Kingdom  they
    were all Tier 4 Migrants. Her father was a student, she and her  mother
    his dependents. At some point his leave was curtailed, because  he  had
    lost  his  place  at  university.   The  family   then   made   various
    unsuccessful attempts to regularise their status. One of these attempts
    was made on the 10th October 2017 when they made joint asylum and human
    rights applications.  These claims were rejected by  the  Secretary  of
    State on the 13th April 2018, and the consequent appeals  dismissed  by
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Evans) on the 22nd  November  2018.  The
    grounds submit that these three events, and the dates upon  which  they
    occurred, are  of  paramount  importance  in  the  Appellant's  present
    appeal. That is because on the date that the Respondent considered  the
    Appellant's human rights claim - the 13th April 2018 - she was a  minor
    who had lived in this country for a continuous period  of  seven  years
    and   therefore   qualified   for   consideration    under    paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv). Mr Stedman submits that the Respondent  failed  to  give
    the Appellant the benefit of that qualification, as did the  First-tier
    Tribunal and indeed  the  Upper  Tribunal  which  subsequently  refused
    permission to appeal. Although detailed and very specific complaint  is
    made  about  various  matters  including  the  behaviour  of   previous
    representatives and the failure of the Home Office to process a fee, in
    fact this point boils down to this  submission:  the  Appellant  should
    have been granted leave to remain in 2018 and that had she done so  she
    would today be on a path to settlement. This was a  weighty  factor  in
    the balancing exercise which Judge Alis refused to engage with.

 6. There are two obvious difficulties with this ground.

 7. The first is that the injustice - whether 'historic' or not, a matter I
    return to below - is not  made  out.  Paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
    Immigration Rules provides:

    (1)    The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave  to  remain
         on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at  the  date  of
         application, the applicant ...

         (iv)     is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
             the UK for at least seven years  (discounting  any  period  of
             imprisonment) and it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
             applicant to leave the UK".

 8. Assuming that the Appellant's dependency upon her mother's  asylum  and
    human rights claim can be characterised as  an  'application'  for  the
    purposes of 276ADE(1)(vi), it can be seen that  she  had  not,  at  the
    point that it was made, spent seven  continuous  years  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The application was made on the 10th October  2017,  when  she
    still had two weeks to go til she reached  the  seven  year  mark  (she
    arrived in the United Kingdom on the 24th October 2017).  She  was  not
    therefore a 'qualifying' child upon the date of application.  Nor could
    the Appellant establish that she prima facie met the requirement of the
    provision at the date of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal. The
    appeal was heard on the 22nd November  2018,  when  the  Appellant  had
    already turned 18. It could not therefore be said that at that date the
    refusal to grant leave was obviously disproportionate  on  the  grounds
    that the Appellant then qualified for leave under the Rules.  The  best
    that the Appellant could do is to point out that for a period  of  some
    months, between the 24th October 2017 (when  she  reached  the  7  year
    mark) and the 28th May 2018 (when she reached majority) she met one  of
    the requirements contained in 276ADE(1)(iv):  being  a  child  who  had
    lived here for seven years.

 9. The written Grounds  of  Appeal  are  conspicuously  silent  about  the
    remaining limb of the rule: the Appellant also had to establish that it
    would "not be reasonable to expect her to leave"  the  United  Kingdom.
    On that matter the First-tier Tribunal had in  2018  concluded,  in  an
    undisturbed decision, that it was not disproportionate to  expect  this
    child to leave the United Kingdom with her parents, neither of whom had
    had any extant leave to remain for some time. It  is  therefore  simply
    inaccurate to assert, as Mr Stedman  does,  that  the  Appellant  prima
    facie qualified for leave to remain during that  period,  or  that  her
    previous representatives were somehow at fault for  "failing  to  press
    this case".

10. I would  add  that  recent  Tribunal  authority  makes  it  clear  that
    arguments of this sort do not  gain  weight  simply  by  attaching  the
    adjective 'historic' to an allegation of  injustice:   Patel  (historic
    injustice; NIAA Part 5A) [2020] UKUT 00351(IAC).  In  that  decision  a
    Presidential panel draws a distinction between cases where  some  wrong
    has occurred in the past - historical injustice - and cases where there
    is now a recognition by the state of  a  particular  class  of  persons
    having been treated unfairly:

         For the future, the expression "historic injustice", as used in the
         immigration context, should be reserved for  cases  such  as  those
         concerning certain British Overseas citizens or families of  Gurkha
         ex-servicemen, which involve a belated recognition  by  the  United
         Kingdom government that a particular class of persons  was  wrongly
         treated, in immigration terms, in the past; and that this injustice
         should be recognised in dealing  with  applications  made  now  (eg
         Patel and Others v Entry Clearance Officer (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ
         17; AP (India) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]
         EWCA Civ 89).

         The fact that the injustice exists will be uncontroversial. It will
         be generally recognised. It will apply to  a  particular  class  of
         persons. Unlike cases of what might  be  described  as  "historical
         injustice", the operation of historic injustice will not depend  on
         the particular interaction between the  individual  member  of  the
         class and the Secretary of State. The effects of historic injustice
         on the immigration position of the  individual  are  likely  to  be
         profound, even determinative of success,  provided  that  there  is
         nothing materially adverse in their immigration history.

11. This case is, quite evidently, not of that type.

12. I now turn to Judge Alis' approach. At paragraph 6 of his  decision  he
    summarises the 2018 findings of First-tier Tribunal Judge Evans.  These
    included, at (h), the Tribunal's conclusions on the arguments  advanced
    in respect of 276ADE(1)(vi). Judge Evans had regard to the  Appellant's
    educational achievements, her good level of integration in  the  United
    Kingdom and the fact that she  had  spent  her  formative  teens  here;
    against those matters were  weighed  the  fact  that  she  could  speak
    Sinhalese, with some ability in reading and writing, and the fact  that
    in the 'real world' she would  be  accompanied  and  supported  by  her
    parents. Applying the guidance in KO (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53  Judge
    Evans found it reasonable to expect her to return to Sri Lanka with her
    parents in those circumstances.  At his paragraph 7  Judge  Alis  notes
    that the Appellant was unsuccessful in her attempts to  appeal  against
    the decision of Judge Evans.   At paragraph 15 Judge Alis records  that
    Mr Stedman had filed a skeleton argument which advanced the proposition
    that the Appellant had been treated unfairly by Judge Evans:

         "I indicated to him that I was  not  dealing  with  those  previous
         decisions...the appeal in these cases arose out of the 29 May  2019
         application and  subsequent  decision  and  when  the  second-named
         appellant was over the age of 18 years of age. She  was  no  longer
         covered by either paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) HC 395 or section 117B(6)
         of the 2002 Act.

         Even if Judge Evans had erred then that was something that  had  to
         be taken up in that appeal ...".

13. Having so directed himself in his subsequent proportionality  balancing
    exercise Judge Alis attaches no significant weight to the fact that  at
    some point in  the  past  the  Appellant  met  one  limb  of  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv). Mr Stedman contends that this  was  an  error.  For  the
    reasons set out above  am satisfied that no material  error  arises  in
    the context of  an  assertion  that  this  amounted  to  a  failure  to
    recognise historical injustice: whether there was some other  error  in
    approach to the Appellant's long residence I deal with below at  ground
    (c).

    Ground (b): Very Significant Obstacles

14. By the date of the appeal before Judge Alis the Appellant was an  adult
    woman of nineteen years. His starting point, upon consideration of  her
    private life claim, was therefore paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules,
    which provides that leave may be granted where the applicant  can  show
    that they have:

         "lived continuously in the UK for less than 20  years  (discounting
         any period of imprisonment) but there  would  be  very  significant
         obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to  which
         he would have to go if required to leave the United Kingdom".

15. In answering this question Judge Alis had a clearly delineated starting
    point: the findings of two panels of the First-tier Tribunal  that  had
    gone before him. In 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge Bell had found  that
    the Appellant and her parents have social  and  cultural  ties  to  Sri
    Lanka, relatives who were willing to support them and English  language
    education for the Appellant.  To the extent that  the  Appellant  might
    have lost some of her Sinhalese in the time that she has spent here she
    is a bright student  who  would  quickly  regain  proficiency  in  that
    language.  Those findings were confirmed by the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Evans in 2018.   Judge Alis found no material change  in
    circumstances, save that one close relative had now left Sri Lanka  for
    America.

16. The ground - not pursued orally by Mr Stedman  -  is  that  these  were
    insufficient reasons. They plainly were not. The test at  276ADE(1)(vi)
    is a narrow one and it does not purport to be a 'complete code' for the
    assessment of  Article  8  private  life,  excluding  as  it  does  any
    consideration of the individual's already established private  life  in
    the United Kingdom. This is a matter I return  to  below.  But  in  the
    context of the rule, Judge Alis was wholly entitled  to  conclude  that
    the high threshold of "very significant obstacles" was not met.

    Ground (c): Private Life

17. Without wishing to diminish Mr Stedman's submissions, both written  and
    oral, the real complaint here is about the fact that the Appellant  has
    lived in this country for a full decade of her  young  life,  and  that
    this matter has been given insufficient weight.

18. It is of course trite that weight is a matter for the judge: I can only
    interfere with the decision below on this matter if it is shown  to  be
    perverse.

19. I start with what was taken into  account.    The  First-tier  Tribunal
    started, as I note above, with directing itself to facts already  found
    by previous tribunals.  This  necessarily  involved  a  review  of  the
    findings in respect of  the  Appellant:  references  are  made  to  her
    education and language abilities  in  both  2016  and  2018  judgments.
    Moving on to the evidence as it stood before him, Judge Alis noted that
    the Appellant had completed both primary and secondary education in the
    United Kingdom and that she had been offered a place to read Psychology
    at Keele University; she arrived in this country aged 10, has spent her
    formative years here and is well integrated.  She has  volunteered  for
    various organisations and has  achieved  excellent  GCSE  and  A  level
    results. She regards the United Kingdom as her home,  over  Sri  Lanka.
    Against these matters the Judge balanced the  following  factors:  that
    there were no real obstacles to the family reintegrating in Sri  Lanka,
    the Appellant could,  as  found  in  2016,  quickly  brush  up  on  her
    Sinhalese, she could pursue her tertiary education  in  Sri  Lanka  and
    there was no basis for finding that the decision to refuse leave  would
    result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for her.

20. It is perhaps self-evident that all of that was  relevant.  Mr  Stedman
    submitted however that absent from  that  consideration  was  any  real
    analysis of his submissions about how the family  had  been  failed  by
    representatives in the past, and how greater weight  should  have  been
    given to the 'compliance window' in respect of  276ADE(1)(iv):  see  my
    [�8] above.  For the reasons I have set  out  above  that  argument  is
    entirely misconceived. It may be that another Tribunal  would,  between
    October 2017 and  May  2018,  have  concluded  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the Appellant to leave the United Kingdom so  that
    she qualified under the rule. But that was not  the  finding  of  Judge
    Evans and that decision remained undisturbed: Judge Alis was  therefore
    Devaseelan bound to accept that its findings were a final determination
    of matters as they stood at that date.  I  should  add  that  I  wholly
    reject Mr Stedman's criticism of  Counsel  who  appeared  before  Judge
    Evans on the Appellant's  behalf:   his  allegation  that  she  somehow
    failed to "press the case" under 276ADE(1)(iv) is obviously ill-founded
    given that the Appellant was, by  the  hearing  in  November  2018,  an
    adult.
