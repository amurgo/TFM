                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

    1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I will refer to
       the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 8th  October  1981.
       He applied for entry clearance to come to the UK as a family visitor
       and  was  refused  on  10th  July  2011.  He  appealed  but   in   a
       determination promulgated on 13th January 2012 Judge of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Bailey found he had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal
       as there was no evidence of the relationship between  the  appellant
       and sponsor. The appellant applied  again  for  entry  clearance  to
       visit his cousin Mr Mohammed A Uddin and  his  brother  Mr  Shafiqur
       Rahman who are both British  citizens.  The  application  was  again
       refused, this time on 12th June 2013.  The  appellant  appealed  and
       this appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  McDade  in  a
       determination promulgated on the 2nd September 2014.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Kelly on the 9th October 2014 on the basis that it was arguable that
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law as the refusal  raised  the
       issue of intention to return under paragraph 41 of  the  Immigration
       Rules and the First-tier Tribunal had  not  dealt  with  it  in  the
       determination.

    4. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    5. Mr Jarvis relied upon the grounds of appeal. These contended that it
       was an error of law for the First-tier Tribunal not to deal with the
       appellant's intention to return when this was raised in the  refusal
       notice.

    6. Mr Kamal accepted that the determination  did  not  deal  with  this
       issue, although he felt the issue had  been  aired  in  the  hearing
       before Judge McDade

Conclusion - Error of Law

    7. I informed the parties that I found that Judge McDade had  erred  in
       law by not making any findings on intention to leave the UK  at  the
       end  of  the  visit,  a  requirement  at  paragraph  41(ii)  of  the
       Immigration Rules; and on the issue of whether the appellant  was  a
       genuine visitor and thus  fulfilled  the  requirement  at  paragraph
       41(i) the Immigration Rules when these had clearly been put in issue
       by the refusal notice of 12th June 2013.

    8. There was no challenge to the findings of Judge McDade  in  relation
       to accommodation  and  maintenance  (and  thus  that  the  appellant
       satisfied the requirements at paragraph 41 (vi)  and  (vii)  of  the
       Immigration Rules) so I retained all the findings of Judge McDade at
       paragraphs 5 and 6 of the determination, but  set  aside  the  final
       decision allowing the appeal.

Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

    9. Mr Shafiqur Rahman (the  appellant's  brother)  confirmed  that  his
       letter in support of the appeal was genuine, true  and  correct.  In
       relation to the issues in remaking he says  the  following  relevant
       information. He is a British citizen who believes his  brother  will
       respect the UK immigration laws and visit him for a short period.

   10. Mr Mohammed  Amed  Uddin  (the  appellant's  cousin)  confirmed  his
       statement was genuine, true and correct. In relation to  the  issues
       in remaking Mr Uddin says that the appellant owns a poultry and fish
       farm in Sylhet. He would ensure that the appellant returns prior  to
       the expiry of his leave as a visitor and has no recourse  to  public
       funds. In oral evidence Mr Uddin added his cousin was coming to  the
       UK for one month.  He would report the appellant to the  authorities
       if he did not return straight away at the end of his visit. He  felt
       it would not look good for him if the appellant did not go back.  He
       would call the UKBA and let them know and give the UKBA any  details
       he knew. Another brother would care  for  the  appellant's  business
       whilst he was away. The appellant had not been to the UK before.  He
       himself had tried to sponsor someone once before but  the  visa  had
       been refused on the basis that that person would not go back at  the
       end of their visit. He was in Bangladesh recently for  10  days  and
       had seen the appellant, but not his business as  he  was  there  for
       another reason.

   11. Mr Jarvis submitted that he relied upon the notice  of  refusal.  He
       accepted that the sponsor had been found credible by Judge McDade.

   12. Mr Kamal submitted that in the appellant's bundle there was a letter
       from the cousin who would care for the appellant's  business  whilst
       he was away; there was a further statutory declaration from Mr Uddin
       stating that the appellant would  comply  with  immigration  control
       including  leaving  the  country;  and  in  his  own  statement  the
       appellant said that he would leave the UK and return  to  Bangladesh
       at the end of his visit. When all the evidence  was  considered  the
       appellant clearly was a genuine visitor who intended to return  home
       at the end of his visit.

   13. At the end of the hearing I informed the parties that I would  allow
       the appeal on this point for the reasons set out below, thus meaning
       that the appeal was allowed overall.

Conclusions - Remaking

   14. I must determine  whether,  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  the
       appellant can show he can meet the requirements at  paragraph  41(i)
       and 41(ii) of the Immigration Rules.  It has already been decided by
       Judge McDade that the appellant can meet paragraph 41(vi) and  (vii)
       of the Immigration Rules and no other sub-sections are put in  issue
       by the refusal of entry clearance.

   15. I find that the appellant has his own business, Rahman  Poultry  and
       Fishery Farm; he owns land in Bangladesh; and has money in the  bank
       there. He has made an arrangement with a  cousin  to  care  for  the
       business for the four weeks he wishes to come to visit  the  UK.  He
       has a wife and extended family in Bangladesh to whom  he  wishes  to
       return. The appellant and Mr Uddin (his primary sponsor)  are  fully
       aware that remaining beyond the terms of his entry  clearance  would
       be illegal. Mr Uddin is clearly close to the appellant and  saw  him
       on his recent trip  to  Bangladesh,  as  well  as  speaking  to  him
       regularly on the telephone, giving good family visit reasons for the
       trip. Judge McDade has  found  the  appellant  would  be  adequately
       accommodated and maintained without working or claiming benefits  in
       the UK and I adopt this findings.

   16. On consideration of the evidence of the appellant's sponsor Mr Uddin
       (which like Judge McDade  I  find  credible);  the  appellant's  own
       statement of evidence; and given the extensive  ties  the  appellant
       has with his country of origin giving him incentive  to  return  and
       the genuine family reasons for the visit to the UK  I  am  satisfied
       that the appellant is a genuine visitor who will  leave  the  UK  to
       return to Bangladesh at the end of his four week visit.

Decision

   17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   18. The decision but not the findings of the First-tier Tribunal was set
       aside.

   19. The  appeal  is  remade  allowing  it  under  paragraph  41  of  the
       Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a whole fee
award of ï¿½140 for the following reason. This was the fee award made by
Judge McDade and the respondent did not raise any issue with this or make
submissions on it during the remaking proceedings. Evidence and reasons why
the appellant would leave the UK at the end of his visit (his family,
business, property and understanding of the Immigration Rules) was provided
to the entry clearance officer prior to the refusal.
