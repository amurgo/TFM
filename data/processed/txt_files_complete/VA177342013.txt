Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Ghafur, Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 5th November  1920.  She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 21st July  2013  to
    refuse her entry clearance as a family visitor.  That  decision  stated
    that her right of appeal was  limited  by  section  84(1)  (c)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.   First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Oscar Del Fabbro sitting at Taylor  House  on  27th  August  2014
    allowed the Appellant's appeal. The matter comes before me as an appeal
    by the Respondent, who is the Entry Clearance  Officer  in  Abu  Dhabi,
    against the first instance decision to allow the  appeal.  However  for
    the sake of convenience I shall continue to refer  to  the  parties  as
    they were known at first instance.

2.   The facts of  the  case  are  relatively  straightforward  and  not  in
    dispute.  The Appellant made her application  for  entry  clearance  to
    come and see her extended family in the  United  Kingdom  on  5th  July
    2013.  The Judge refers at paragraph 8 of his  determination  to  there
    being a large extended family in the United Kingdom (I  was  told  that
    there were some 25  relatives  living  in  the  United  Kingdom).   The
    Appellant first came to the United Kingdom in 1976  with  her  husband,
    the Sponsor's father, with the intention  of  settling  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Appellant found it difficult to settle  in  this  country
    and chose to return to the  family  home.   She  returned  to  live  in
    Pakistan in 1979 having lived in the  United  Kingdom  for  some  three
    years.

3.   She has since returned on family visits  to  the  UK.  This  visit  was
    planned by her family in the UK because the Sponsor  and  the  extended
    family in the United Kingdom find it  difficult  to  coordinate  family
    trips to Pakistan which I can well appreciate as  did  the  Judge.  The
    Appellant was described as being in full health and sprightly  for  her
    age and self-sufficient.  Her brother would be accompanying her on  the
    visit and would return with her to Pakistan.  He  was  also  a  regular
    visitor to the United Kingdom and there was ample financial support.

4.   Given that history it is not  surprising  that  the  Judge  found  that
    paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules was satisfied.  Paragraph 41 sets
    out the requirements to be met by any person seeking entry clearance to
    the United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor  and  there  are  various  relevant
    requirements such as that there  is  an  intention  to  return  to  the
    country of origin at the end of the visit and that there are sufficient
    financial means to support the visitor during the period of the  visit.
    The Judge found as a fact that paragraph 41 would be  satisfied  and  I
    see no reason to doubt that finding.

5.   Up to 25th June 2013 that would have been the end of the  matter.   The
    appeal would have been allowed, there would have been no error  of  law
    and the first instance decision would stand.  No  doubt  the  Appellant
    would have her visit, see her family and return to Pakistan at the  end
    of the visit.  However, the situation is not quite that simple  because
    on 25th June Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act  2013  was  brought
    into force and this restricted  the  rights  of  appeal  for  visitors.
    Section 52 provides that there is only a  right  of  appeal  against  a
    decision to refuse a family visit visa in one of two circumstances,  1)
    that that decision would breach this country's  obligations  under  the
    European Convention on Human Rights or 2) the decision is  unlawful  by
    virtue of Section 29 of the Equality Act 2010 so far as it  relates  to
    race as defined by Section 9(1) of that Act..  Where Article 8  of  the
    Human Rights Convention (the right to respect for  private  and  family
    life) is argued the burden of proof of establishing that rests  on  the
    Appellant and the standard of proof is the usual civil standard of  the
    balance of probabilities. The Appellant would need  to  show  that  the
    refusal  of  their  visit  visa  application  would  disproportionately
    interfere with their rights under Article 8.

6.   Very fairly the Sponsor, Mr Ghafur, accepts that this  is  not  a  case
    where Article 8 or the Race Relations Act can properly be raised.  They
    have not been raised up to now, they were not raised in  front  of  the
    Judge and this appeal does not engage  either  the  convention  or  the
    statute.  There is no doubt that the Appellant has a family  life  with
    her relatives in this country but that is  a  relationship  of  adults.
    There is no dependency between the parties and it is difficult  to  see
    how Article 8 can be engaged in this case. There is no issue as to  the
    Equality Act. That being the case, the fact is that the Judge  did  not
    have a valid appeal in front of him and he made a material error of law
    in dealing with the case on the basis of paragraph  41  and  completely
    ignoring the 2013 Act.  I therefore  set  his  decision  aside  on  the
    ground of a material error of law and I proceed to remake the decision.

7.   It follows from what I have said  that  just  as  there  was  no  valid
    appeal before Judge Del Fabbro so there can be no valid  appeal  before
    me by the Appellant, and in those  circumstances  I  must  dismiss  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it  aside.   I  remake  the  decision  in  this  case  by
dismissing the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decision  to
refuse entry clearance.

Appellant's appeal dismissed

I make no anonymity direction as there is no public  policy  reason  for  so
doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The Judge made a full fee award in this case in  the  sum  of  ï¿½140  stating
that in the light of his decision to allow the appeal he would make such  an
award.  It follows that as he had no valid appeal before him  that  decision
too cannot stand and I therefore set aside the fee award decision.
