                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Burns,  promulgated on 7th February 2014, dismissing  his  appeal
    against refusal of entry clearance as a spouse.

 2. The ECO decided on 18 March 2013 that the Appellant could  not  benefit
    from paragraph E-ECP.3.3 of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules,  but
    gave no reason.  That provision enables financial  requirements  to  be
    met by showing that the applicant's partner is in  receipt  of  carer's
    allowance, along with "evidence that their partner is able to  maintain
    and accommodate themselves, the applicant and any dependants adequately
    in the UK without recourse to public funds."

 3. The Sponsor is in receipt of  carer's  allowance,  in  respect  of  her
    disabled daughter.

 4. In his Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal,  supported  by  an
    extract from a UKBA website, the Appellant maintained that he did  fall
    within  E-ECP.3.3  because  his  Sponsor  is  in  receipt  of   carer's
    allowance.  The UKBA source continues, "You will need to show that your
    Sponsor can maintain and  accommodate  you  without  access  to  public
    funds".

 5. Notwithstanding those well focussed  Grounds,  a  review  by  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager dated 4th September 2013 is in standard and unhelpful
    terms, maintaining the original refusal.

 6. At paragraph 28 of his determination Judge Burns  took  the  view  that
    because the Sponsor receives and intends to continue receiving  carer's
    allowance "therefore  E-ECP.3.3  is  not  a  route  available  to  this
    Appellant.  That  appears  to  be  an  interpretation  consistent  with
    paragraph 21 of Appendix FM-SE."

 7. Mr Mullen acknowledged that the Judge's interpretation is not  correct.
    Reliance on E-ECP.3.3 assumes continuing receipt of carer's  allowance.
    To read the provision as requiring a Sponsor  to  give  up  the  income
    which triggers its application would be absurd.  Mr  Mullen  also  took
    the approach that the Appellant's possible earnings in the UK could not
    be taken into account in relation to the Sponsor's ability to  maintain
    and accommodate, but that his savings were relevant.

 8. Submissions did not focus on that latter point, and I do not find it to
    have a clear answer.  Looking at E-ECP.3.3 in isolation, why should the
    ability of one partner not contribute to the other's ability?   On  the
    other hand, is the mention of a partner but  not  an  applicant  (which
    contrasts with other provisions of the Rules) designed to mean that the
    ability must be of the partner alone?  Why might  savings  be  relevant
    but not likely earnings?  As Judge Burns said  (�25)  these  provisions
    are difficult to follow.  Without any disrespect to the  ECO,  the  ECM
    and the two Presenting Officers who have been assigned a difficult task
    (no doubt in each case under pressure of time), it is an unsatisfactory
    system which does not produce any clear analysis  from  the  respondent
    even after such prolonged procedure.  (I add that  Mr  Mullen  did  his
    utmost to help the UT to work towards the correct outcome on the day.)

 9. Mr Mullen did not say that paragraph 21 of Appendix FM-SE supports  the
    disapplication of E-ECP.3.3, and I see nothing in paragraph 21 to  that
    effect.

10. For purposes of this case, I am content to adopt the approach  proposed
    by  the  Presenting  Officer,  which  is:  E-ECP.3.3  does  apply;  the
    Appellant's prospective earnings do not count; his savings do count.

11. Mr Mullen advised that the period of initial admission in such  a  case
    is 33 months.  While the Rules do not specify a period for which  funds
    for maintenance and accommodation must  be  shown,  he  suggested  that
    period would be the appropriate benchmark.  The Appellant  has  savings
    equating to �21,000.  The weekly income support level for a  couple  is
    �113.70.  The Sponsor's mortgage is due  to  be  paid  off  soon.   Her
    monthly repayments are modest (in  the  range  �82.79  to  �77.98  from
    November 2011 until  August  2012,  according  to  an  annual  mortgage
    statement produced with the application).  Having examined the relevant
    information, Mr Mullen finally, and very fairly, acknowledged that  not
    only had there been error of law in failing to identify that  E-ECP.3.3
    is a route available to the  Appellant,  he  succeeds  in  meeting  the
    requirements of that paragraph.

12. Having reached that conclusion, no submissions were made on Article  8,
    although that is what led to the grant of permission to appeal  to  the
    UT.  In the alternative, and recognising the limited scope of Article 8
    outside the Rules, there would be at least a good arguable case.  Apart
    from maintaining the Rules, there appears to be little public  interest
    in excluding the Appellant.  The Sponsor is a UK citizen who has always
    lived here, does not speak Arabic, and has all her family  and  private
    life here, which includes caring for her disabled daughter.

13. The determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
    following determination  is  substituted:  the  appeal,  as  originally
    brought to the First-tier Tribunal, is allowed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.
