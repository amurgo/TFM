For the Respondent:    The Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO"),  for
    convenience I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Malaysia who was born on 6 November 1993.
     On 23 April 2015, the ECO refused his application for  an  EEA  family
    permit as the family member of an EEA national  under  reg  12  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003 as amended).  The  ECO
    was not satisfied that the  appellant  had  established  as  a  "family
    member" in that he had not established that he  was  dependent  on  his
    mother who is the civil partner of an EEA national as  defined  in  reg
    7(1)(b).

 3. The appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  K  Real
    allowed the appellant's appeal.  She was satisfied that  the  appellant
    had established that the sponsor provided financial support,  in  part,
    to provide for his "basic needs".  He was, therefore, a  family  member
    of the civil partner of an EEA national and was entitled  to  a  family
    permit under reg 12.

 4. The ECO appealed to the Upper Tribunal  on  a  number  of  grounds,  in
    essence contending that the judge had inadequate evidence to  establish
    that the financial support the  appellant  received  from  the  sponsor
    provided for his essential or basic needs.

 5. Permission was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal, but on  30
    May 2017 the Upper Tribunal (UTJ Frances) granted the ECO permission to
    appeal.

 6. At the hearing before me, the ECO was represented by Mr  Diwyncz.   The
    appellant was not legally represented but  the  sponsor,  Liane  Gauder
    attended the hearing and spoke on the appellant's behalf.

The Judge's Decision

 7. The judge's reasons are at  paras  15-21  of  her  determination.   She
    accepted that the appellant was in receipt of  financial  support  from
    the sponsor.  In Malaysia (the  judge  inadvertently  referred  to  the
    appellant living in the "Philippines"), the  judge  accepted  that  the
    appellant lived with his maternal aunt.  He did not have  to  meet  any
    accommodation costs.   However,  the  judge  found  that  nevertheless,
    despite his income, his bank account demonstrated that he depleted  his
    resources each month in order to meet "his basic needs".  At paras  15-
    21, Judge Real reasoned as follows:

         "15. It is not in dispute, and I find, that the Appellant has  been
             receiving significant sums of money from his mother in the  UK
             over the past few years.  On the  basis  of  the  evidence  of
             before me, some very substantial sums have been spent to  fund
             courses for the Appellant.  I find these do not count as basic
             needs and I take them out of account.  However the last course
             was undertaken about 2.5 to 3 years ago and  large  sums  have
             continued to be sent from his mother in the UK.  In particular
             the documents show a payment of �2000 on 8th December 2014 and
             �3000 on 10th February 2015.  I am  satisfied  that  financial
             support is in fact being received by the  Appellant  from  his
             mother, who is the civil partner of the EEA sponsor.

         16.  I turn to the question  of  whether  the  Appellant  is  in  a
             position to support himself in order to meet his basic  needs.
             The documentary evidence submitted with  the  application  and
             subsequently has focussed upon the financial situation of  the
             Appellant's mother and her partner, the provision of financial
             support by them, and has evidenced the Appellant's employment,
             but does not directly provide an answer to this issue.   I  do
             not find that the fact that the Appellant has  employment  and
             income of his own to be determinative.

         17.  There are some bank statements of the Appellant from 2014  and
             2015 which show that his salary is paid into his  account  and
             then his account is depleted to a minimal balance prior to the
             next payment of his salary.   There  are  some  cash  deposits
             shown separately  to  the  salary.   It  is  not  possible  to
             determine from the documents how the money is being spent, but
             there is no evidence of a  significant  or  increasing  credit
             balance.  The monthly living costs stated on  the  Appellant's
             application (RM 2300) outstrip the salary as it  was  at  that
             same point (RM 1681.75  net).   I  find  all  of  this  to  be
             consistent with the Appellant's case as it is before me,  that
             is, that he relies on the financial support of his  mother  to
             meet his basic needs.

         18.  The Appellant did not have the benefit of legal representation
             and his sponsor, who was his representative  at  the  hearing,
             was frank in acknowledging, as she became cognisant of the key
             issue, that a calculation of living costs would have assisted.
               However  I  bear  in  mind  that  there  is  no   particular
             requirement as to the form of evidence,  simply  that  matters
             are established to the required standard.  I found the sponsor
             forthcoming in her answers and she was able to  give  detailed
             evidence, and the manner in which the case was put forward and
             the preponderance of paperwork I found to be indicative  of  a
             genuine attempt to assist the Tribunal.  For example  she  was
             clear where money in the past had been spent  on  courses  and
             she volunteered the  information  about  the  Appellant's  now
             increased salary.  For these reasons I found her  evidence  to
             be credible, and found nothing that suggested unreliability as
             to the facts she recounted  about  the  circumstances  of  the
             Appellant.

         19.  The sponsor gave an estimate of RM 15,000 to 20,000 per  month
             which would be necessary to live an independent  life  in  the
             Philippines.  Quite aside from whether  this  is  an  accurate
             estimate,  having  regard  to   the   social   and   financial
             circumstances of this Appellant in the Philippines  I  do  not
             find that this is the standard that I am required to consider,
             because the evidence was that the Appellant lives in a  family
             home, which would be the usual situation for any young  person
             in the Philippines before they got married.  For that reason I
             take the narrower  view  invited  by  Mr.  Howells,  that  the
             support required to meet this Appellant's basic needs does not
             presently include the  finances  necessary  to  rent  his  own
             accommodation.  Acknowledging this may not  be  the  permanent
             situation  I  do  not  find  that  the  evidence   before   me
             establishes  that  the   accommodation   will   be   withdrawn
             imminently.

         20.  It was common ground that the Appellant's current basic  needs
             involved food, clothing, and petrol.  I accept  the  sponsor's
             evidence  that  the  Appellant   does   not   have   luxuries,
             particularly because she was immediately able to give examples
             of common items that he did not own, such  as  an  iphone  and
             laptop.  I also found the necessity for  material  support  in
             respect of basic items was reinforced by  her  evidence  of  a
             recent trip to Hungary  where  they  had  not  only  paid  the
             Appellant's  travel  costs  and  given  him  �2500,  but  also
             purchased clothes for him.

         21.  Taking the evidence overall I am satisfied that the  Appellant
             cannot support himself from his own resources, even  with  the
             provision  of  free  accommodation  in  his   current   social
             circumstances, because he is regularly depleting his resources
             received as  a  combination  of  salary  from  employment  and
             transfers from his mother in the UK in order to meet his basic
             needs.  I am satisfied that there is a shortfall  between  his
             salary and that which he requires  to  be  in  a  position  to
             support himself, and that the  material  support  he  receives
             from his mother in the UK is necessary."

Discussion

 8. In his submissions, Mr Diwyncz contended that evidence, in the form  of
    a schedule of income and expenditure, would have helped in  determining
    the appeal.  However, he conceded that the judge's decision was  within
    the spectrum of reasonable findings that the judge could  make  on  the
    basis of the evidence.  Nevertheless, he  submitted  that  the  judge's
    reasons were inadequate.

 9. In determining whether the appellant was dependent upon the sponsor for
    the purposes of reg 7(1)(b) of the  EEA  Regulations  2006,  the  judge
    correctly directed herself on the law in accordance with the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision in Lim v Entry Clearance Officer, Manila [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 1383 at para 12 of her determination.  At [32], Elias  LJ  set  out
    the legal position as follows:

         "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the  claimant  is
         in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,  and  Reyes  now
         makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That is a simple matter
         of fact.  If he can support himself, there is no  dependency,  even
         if he is given financial material support by the EU citizen.  Those
         additional resources are not necessary to enable him  to  meet  his
         basic needs.  If, on the other hand, he cannot support himself from
         his own resources, the court will not ask why  that  is  the  case,
         save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights."

10. In this case, the judge clearly found on the evidence that the  sponsor
    provided  financial  support   to   the   appellant.    She   accepted,
    unequivocally, the sponsor's evidence and, as Mr Diwyncz  acknowledged,
    the judge was entitled to do so.  Her evidence was that  the  appellant
    could  not  live  without  financial  support.   At  para  20  of   her
    determination, Judge Real noted the evidence that the appellant  lacked
    certain luxuries (such as an I-phone and laptop) and that a recent trip
    to Hungary had been paid for including purchasing him clothes  for  the
    trip.  Importantly, at para 20, she notes  and  accepted  the  evidence
    that the appellant's bank account, in which he received both his salary
    and transfers from his mother in  the  UK,  was  depleted  each  month.
    Although the judge also noted that it would have been helpful  to  have
    had a "calculation of living costs" (see para 18 of the determination),
    that was not a requirement in order for the appellant to  succeed.   As
    the court in Lim emphasised, dependency  to  meet  basic  needs  is  "a
    simple matter of fact".  Here the judge had the evidence of the sponsor
    together with evidence that the appellant did not seem to  spend  money
    on luxuries and his money, received from his income together with  that
    from his mother in the UK, was exhausted each month.

11. In my judgment, the judge was entitled to accept  the  evidence  before
    her and find that the appellant was dependent on his  mother  and  that
    that dependency went to meet his basic needs.  As a consequence, he had
    established that he was a "family member" of the civil  partner  of  an
    EEA  national.   Judge  Real  did  not  err  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal on that basis.

Decision

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    under reg 12 of the EEA Regulations 2006 did not involve the making  of
    an error of law.  That decision stands.

13. Accordingly, the ECO's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Judge Real did not consider it appropriate to make a fee award.  I  was  not
invited to reach any different decision and so that decision stands.
