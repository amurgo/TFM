                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a decision by the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Coll)  ("FTT")  who  dismissed  the  appellant's   appeal   under   the
    Immigration rules against a  refusal  of  indefinite  leave  and  under
    Article 8 outside of the Rules.







    Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and he entered the UK in 2004 as
    a student in which capacity he was  granted  further  leave  to  remain
    until 27th July 2013. He made an application under Tier 1 on 26th  July
    2013 which was rejected on 26th September 2013  because  he  failed  to
    provide the biometric data. The application  was  treated  as  invalid,
    attracting no right of appeal. On 23rd October 2013 he  made  the  same
    application out of time. In a letter dated 12th December  2013  it  was
    refused for financial reasons with  no  right  of  appeal.  He  made  a
    further out of time application on 10th December 2014 for settlement in
    the UK on the basis of 10 years residence which was refused in a letter
    was dated 27th  March  2015.  The  appellant  was  considered  to  have
    overstayed since his leave expired on 27th July  2013.  He  was  served
    with a Notice to a person liable to removal and an immigration decision
    on 27th March 2015.  He was given a right of appeal under section 82(1)
    Nationality Immigration & asylum Act 2002.

    First -tier Tribunal decision

 3. The FTT found that the appellant was a credible witness.  It found that
    the application made in July 2013 was treated as  invalid  because  the
    appellant failed to produce biometric data as requested  [23-25].   The
    FTT found that letters were sent to the  Appellant  by  the  Respondent
    (dated 6.8.2013 and 30.8.2013) were never received by him [25] and that
    his solicitors had written to complain about the same  [26].   The  FTT
    found that the appellant should have appealed that decision  [27].  The
    FTT went on the decide that the  July  and  October  applications  made
    under Tier 1 were identical and therefore the non-delivery  of  letters
    to the appellant was a "red herring" [30].   The  effect  of  the  non-
    delivery of the letters was that the appellant was left with  no  right
    of appeal and without continuous lawful residence  [31].  The  decision
    and reasons recorded at [34] that it was accepted that the appeal could
    not have succeeded under the Rules for Tier 1 on financial  grounds  as
    the appellant failed  to  meet  the  threshold  of  ï¿½35,000.   The  FTT
    proceeded on the basis  that  the  appellant  had  lawful  leave  until
    20.12.2013 which was the  position  taken  by  the  respondent  at  the
    hearing.  The appellant argued that Article 8  was  engaged.   The  FTT
    found  that  there  were  no  compelling   circumstances   to   justify
    consideration of Article 8 outside of the Rules.

    Grounds

 4. The appellant argued that the effect of the non-delivery of the letters
    by the respondent had the effect of breaking the continuity  of  lawful
    residence in the UK.  The FTT's finding at [30] was  that  this  was  a
    "red herring" because the application under Tier 1 would have failed in
    any event.  The appellant argued that whilst it made no  difference  to
    the PBS application, it did impact on the continuity of residence under
    paragraph 276ADE having regard to section 3C Immigration Act 1971.

 5. The FTT failed to considered the Respondent's failure to  identify  the
    legitimate aim under Article 8(2).

 6. Permission to appeal was granted on the grounds argued.

 7. A Rule 24 response was relied on by Mr Norton which opposed the  appeal
    under the Rules and argued that the FTT had in any  event  gone  on  to
    consider if Article 8 was engaged.   The  FTT  took  into  account  any
    potential leave under section 3C Immigration Act, by agreeing that  the
    appellant had lawful leave until 20.12.2013.

    Submissions

 8.  Mr Miah contended that the FTT erred  by  failing  to  deal  with  the
    failure of the letters  to  arrive  as  a  non-communication  and  that
    resulted in a decision that was not in accordance with the law. The FTT
    wrongly concluded [27] that the appellant had a right of appeal against
    the decision dated 23.10.2013 and ought to have pursued that appeal. He
    argued that there was a fairness point following JH (Zimbabwe)  v  SSHD
    [2009] EWCA civ 78 and that this Tribunal should remit  the  matter  to
    the respondent for reconsideration of the indefinite leave application.
     The appellant only needed to establish lawful leave until 3rd  October
    2014.

    Discussion and decision

 9. I am satisfied that the FTT correctly considered the chronology of  the
    appellant's immigration history and that the date on which his  student
    leave expired was 27th July 2013. His application  made  on  26th  July
    2013 was in time and rejected on 26th September 2013 as  invalid.   His
    further application was made out of  time  on  23rd  October  2013  and
    rejected in a letter dated 20th  December  2013  on  the  grounds  that
    financial requirements were not met and he was given no right of appeal
    as he had no lawful leave at the time of making the application.  It is
    accepted that the PBS application would have been rejected in any event
    and after which the appellant would have had no extant leave nor  leave
    under section 3C.  Mr Miah submits that had the appellant's application
    been treated as in time,  it  would  have  been  refused  on  financial
    grounds but he would have had continuing leave that could have  met  10
    years continuous residence. The date to  be  reached  was  3rd  October
    2014.  The FTT ought to have remitted the matter to the respondent once
    it accepted that a mistake had been made. Mr Norton contends  that  the
    FTT considered the matter with reference to 3C leave in any  event  and
    had proceeded on the basis that the lawful leave ended on 20th December
    2013 and so the 10 year period was not met.

10. I find that there was a gap in the lawful leave between 20.12.2013  and
    10.12.2014, the latter was the  date  the  application  for  indefinite
    leave was made.  Even if the application made in  July  2013  had  been
    treated as valid, the appellant would only have leave under section  3C
    pending the making of the decision under the Tier 1  provisions,  which
    ultimately  was  refused  on  financial  grounds  on  20.12.2013.   The
    respondent accepted at the hearing before the FTT that the appellant be
    treated as having lawful leave until 20.12.2013.  I find that there was
    no material error of law notwithstanding that the FTT was incorrect  in
    stating that the appellant had a right of appeal when he did not.

11. As to the argument in the grounds re Article 8, I am satisfied that the
    FTT correctly approached the matter according to the recent guidance in
    SS (Congo) and found no compelling circumstances outside of  the  Rules
    [35].  Mr Miah made no submissions on this issue.

Notice of Decision
