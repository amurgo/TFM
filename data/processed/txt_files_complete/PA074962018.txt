Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Ms Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On August 22, 2014 the appellant lodged a Tier 4 (Student) visa
    application and she entered the United Kingdom on 4 September 2014 with
    a visa valid until 26 August 2015.


 2. Her visa expired and she claimed asylum on 5 December 2017 but the
    respondent refused her application on May 31, 2018.

 3. On 14 June 2018 the appellant appealed this decision under section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4. Her appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dhaliwal on 13
    July 2018 and in a decision promulgated on 24 July 2018, the Judge
    allowed her appeal on protection and article 3 ECHR grounds.

 5. The respondent appealed this decision on 4 August 2018 arguing the
    Judge had materially erred by making contradictory findings in
    paragraphs 37 and 38 of her decision. Permission was granted by Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Lambert and the matter came before me
    originally on 3 April 2019.

 6. Having found the Judge had found her involvement with the MDC was low
    level and did not have a significant profile within the MDC, she had
    been able to travel back and forth to Zimbabwe in both 2013 and 2015
    without incident, she had been able to leave Zimbabwe on her passport
    to travel to the United Kingdom and her involvement and her own
    father's involvement with the MDC was sixteen years ago I concluded the
    Judge had erred in subsequently finding the appellant was at risk or
    persecution and serious harm as she had failed to correctly apply the
    decisions of CM (EM country guidance; disclosure) Zimbabwe CG [2013]
    UKUT 00059 (IAC) and SSHD v MM (Zimbabwe) [2017] EWCA Civ 797.

 7. On the last occasion, I had intended to proceed to remake the decision
    but was noted the Judge had not considered her article 8 claim in
    circumstances where she has a daughter in the United Kingdom who held a
    British passport. The appellant produced her passport and stated her
    daughter lived with her although the child's father saw the child
    regularly.

 8. Mr Howells, the respondent's representative at that previous hearing,
    indicated his office would need to review this evidence and any further
    evidence on this issue against their well-stated policy.

 9. I adjourned the matter to enable the appellant to provide a statement
    setting out her circumstances and those of her daughter and, if
    possible, to obtain a statement from the child's father (she told me
    they were on friendly terms) as well as a letter from her doctors
    confirming the registration of the child and other pertinent details.
    The appellant served this evidence on the respondent.

10. At today's hearing, Mrs Aboni acknowledged that the appellant had a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a British child for whom she
    was the primary carer and she satisfied the requirements of section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act. She invited the Tribunal to allow the appeal
    under article 8 ECHR.

11. In light of this concession the appellant indicated she did not  intend
    to pursue her protection or article 3 ECHR claim.

12. I was satisfied the appellant was not at risk of persecution or serious
    harm for the reasons  set  out  in  the  FTT  Judge's  decision  and  I
    dismissed these grounds of appeal.

13. No anonymity direction is made.


    NOTICE OF DECISION

14. There was an error in law.

15. I set aside the Judge's decision and remake the decision as follows:

      a) I dismiss the protection claim.

      b) I dismiss her claim under article 3 ECHR.

      c) I allow her appeal under article 8 ECHR


Signed                              Date 23/07/2019
