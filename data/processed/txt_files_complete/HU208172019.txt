                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. These are the approved record of the decision and  reasons  which  were
    given orally at the end of the hearing on 29th January 2021.

 2. Both representatives and I attended the hearing via  Skype,  while  the
    hearing was also available to watch,  live,  at  Manchester  CJC.   The
    parties did not object to attending via Skype and I was satisfied  that
    the representatives were able to participate in the hearing.

 3. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Mulholland (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 8th  April  2020,
    by which she dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  respondent's
    refusal on 3rd December 2019 of his application for  leave  to  remain,
    based on long residence, in particular the fact that he had entered the
    UK on 19th June 1998. The respondent did not refuse the application  on
    grounds of  suitability,  but  did  not  accept  that  the  appellant's
    presence in the UK since 1998 as continuous. The appellant had lived in
    his country of  origin,  India,  until  aged  37  years'  old  and  the
    respondent further did not accept that there would be very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's integration in India for the  purposes  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.

 4. In essence, the appellant's claims involved the key  following  issues:
    his continuous presence in the UK; and a very significant obstacles  to
    his integration in India, having spent last 21  years  in  the  UK.  He
    claimed that he would be unable to find employment in India to  support
    his living costs and would face an incredible difficulty  in  adjusting
    to life there.

The FtT's decision

 5. The FtT noted that the appellant had entered the UK on a false identity
    with a false date of birth, on 19th June 1998 (�1).  His  asylum  claim
    had  subsequently  been  refused  on  11th  December  2014.    The  FtT
    considered extensive bundles of evidence running to 118 pages, and five
    witnesses. The FtT noted, at �13, his claimed cohabitation with one  of
    the witnesses since 1998 in West  Bromwich,  albeit  the  witness  then
    moved away (�14).  At  �15,  the  FtT  noted  that  the  appellant  had
    absconded and an address other than in West Bromwich was  recorded.  An
    NHS medical card issued in 2003 referred to a further  address  and  in
    2010, the appellant provided a fourth address  in  his  application  to
    register his father as a British citizen (�15).

 6. The FtT noted what she regarded as a changed account as to addresses at
    �16 and the lack of reliability a witness's evidence, at �17, as to the
    appellant's whereabouts after 2002 despite the witness claiming to have
    known that the appellant was lived in a  specific  address.  Witnesses'
    lack of awareness that the appellant claimed to have  lived  in  London
    undermined their evidence (�18).

 7. The FtT was satisfied that the appellant had attended weddings  in  the
    UK in 1999; 2003 and 2006, but did not find as reliable,  at  �20,  the
    appellant's assertion that he was unable to produce documents to open a
    bank account or obtain any other  services,  as  when  he  had  claimed
    asylum  on  entering  the  UK  he  would  have  been  given  an  Asylum
    application  Registration  Card  or  'ARC'.  The  FtT  found  that  the
    appellant had managed to live in the UK and work,  despite  not  having
    the right to do so, and so must have satisfied those employing that  he
    had the right to work (�21).

 8. The FtT placed particular weight, at �22, on the appellant's failure to
    appeal against the respondent's refusal of his asylum claim in December
    2014, after which his solicitors had sent a letter to the respondent on
    3rd December 2015 asking for an update on the appellant's claim,  which
    cast doubt on the appellant's whereabouts at the time (�23).

 9. The FtT noted that the appellant  was  able  to  produce  some  medical
    records in 2003, 2008 and 2010 but not medical records for  the  period
    before 2012 (�24).

10. At �26, the FtT noted that the appellant had since obtained a passport,
    which showed his address in India,  which  was  inconsistent  with  his
    claim to have no home to go to if he were returned there.

11. Considering evidence as a whole, the FtT concluded at �28 that she  was
    not satisfied that the appellant had discharged the burden of proof  of
    showing that he had been continuously present in  the  UK  since  1998.
    There were inconsistencies in the accounts of where the  appellant  was
    living; gaps in the knowledge of witnesses; a  paucity  of  independent
    documentary evidence; no  attempt  by  the  appellant  to  contact  the
    respondent about his outstanding asylum claim from 1998 until 2010; and
    no attempt to alert the respondent that he had given a false  name  and
    date of birth until 2010.

12. In relation to paragraph  276  ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    namely very significant obstacles to  the  appellant's  integration  in
    India for the purposes of his private life, at �32, the FtT  considered
    that the appellant had not  provided  any  information  as  to  how  he
    managed to live in India before coming to  the  UK  aged  37;  who  his
    family members were and where  they  were.  He  had  not  provided  any
    supporting evidence about job  prospects  and  only  when  pressed,  he
    indicated that his brother still lived in the family home in India. The
    FtT also recorded at �34 that the appellant had not  given  details  of
    his schooling or educational qualifications  or  what  obstacles  there
    might be to his integration in India, beyond the passage of time.

13. At �39, the FtT reminded herself of the provisions of Sections 117A and
    B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and carried out a
    proportionality assessment first through the lens  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, noting at �44 that if the appellant did not meet the  Rules,  it
    was unlikely that a different outcome would result from a free-standing
    proportionality exercise. The FtT nevertheless went  on  to  carry  out
    such a free-standing assessment, and concluded that while the appellant
    had established a private life in the UK (�52), and his Article 8  ECHR
    rights were engaged, the appellant was not financially independent  and
    his private life had been established when his immigration  status  was
    precarious, so that little weight should be attached to  it.   The  FtT
    concluded that the respondent's refusal of the appellant's  application
    was proportionate and dismissed the appellant's appeal.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

14. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on six grounds, details of  five
    of which are set  out  below.  Permission  was  initially  refused  all
    grounds by a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, Judge O'Garro,  on  16th
    June 2020, but renewed permission was granted by Upper  tribunal  Judge
    Norton-Taylor on 27th July 2020 on the following five grounds, starting
    with ground (2), the second ground comprising a number of elements:

      1. Ground (2) - the FtT had arguably imposed an additional requirement
         that the appellant was present in the  UK  every  single  day  from
         1998, for 20 years. Instead, the FtT should have looked at  all  of
         the evidence in the round and even if there were short  gaps,  this
         was not determinative of the appellant's appeal. The implication of
         the FtT finding that the appellant was not continuously present was
         that he must have left the UK and re-entered, which was irrational.
         This ground was, therefore, a perversity challenge,  based  on  the
         following passages in the FtT's reasoning:

             1. the FtT's reference at �20 to  the  appellant  being  issued
                with an ARC card ignored the fact that ARC cards  were  only
                introduced in 2002 and the appellant had claimed  asylum  in
                1998;

             2.  the  FtT's  reference  at  �21,  to  the  appellant  having
                satisfied those he worked for of his right to work, even  if
                under a false identity, ignored the point that the appellant
                sought permission to work, which had only  been  granted  in
                February 2014;

             3. the FtT's adverse finding at �23 that the  appellant  failed
                to appeal against the refusal of his  asylum  claim  ignored
                his solicitors chasing for an update and the fact that there
                could be many reasons for not appealing an adverse decision;



             4. the FtT's finding about the appellant living in London for a
                period in 2002 was perverse and  there  was  no  documentary
                evidence from which  it  was  possible  to  infer  that  the
                appellant had lived in London;

             5. the FtT's finding that the lack of consultations with his GP
                undermined  the  documentary  evidence  of   the   appellant
                registering with a GP in 2003 was also perverse;

             6. the FtT had perversely and impermissibly taken into  account
                the appellant's initial use of a false identity, contrary to
                the authority of ZH (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 8.

      2. Ground (3) - the FtT  had  erred  in  looking  at  the  documentary
         evidence in isolation rather than evidence in the round. There  was
         no  requirement  to  focus  narrowly  only  on  official  documents
         particularly where non-official, but independent  documents,  would
         suffice.

      3. Ground (4) - the FtT had failed to make findings in relation to the
         appellant's oral evidence as to his continuous lawful residence.

      4. Ground (5) - the FtT had  impermissibly  regarded  the  Immigration
         Rules as determinative of the appellant's appeal in respect of  his
         private life, dismissing it because of the  absence  of  compelling
         circumstances.

      5. Ground (6) - the FtT  had  erred  in  considering  the  appellant's
         Article 8 appeal through the lens of the Immigration  Rules,  which
         had been rejected by the Supreme Court in the case of Hesham Ali  v
         SSHD [2016] UKUSC, �44.

The hearing before me

The appellant's submissions

15. Mr Nasim relied upon, but did not reiterate, the detailed grounds.   In
    relation to ground (2), the FtT had been critical of witnesses whom she
    described as having given evidence of the appellant living at the  same
    address continuously, while if I considered the witness  statements  of
    Mr Rapinder Tanda, �3 at page [25] of the appellant's bundle ('AB') and
    Mrs Harbinder Kaur's statement at page [14], �2, neither had  suggested
    they knew that the appellant had lived at the location for the entirety
    of the period.  The same was true of correspondence from  a  supporter,
    Mr Rahul Hallan at page [111] AB.

16. Mr Nasim also referred me to the documents  starting  at  page  67  AB,
    which comprised the respondent's GCID records produced in response to a
    data subject access request.  Noting from those records suggested  that
    the appellant was not contactable when the  respondent  had  sought  to
    contact him.  Mr Nasim initially suggested that there was no  reference
    to the appellant absconding, although it appeared  later  in  the  GCID
    notes that there was such a reference at page 77 AB.   It  was  further
    irrational to speculate on what documentation the appellant would  have
    provided to obtain work, prior to 2014, when he had only given evidence
    working "now and then."

17. In relation to medical evidence, I was asked to consider page 98 AB and
    in particular the problem of medical records being transferred from one
    surgery to another, the implication being that  there  was  a  lack  of
    records because of the appellant's transfer between GP practices.

18. Referring back to the GCID records, at page 69 AB, it appeared that the
    appellant's representatives only,  and  not  the  appellant,  had  been
    informed of the refusal of the protection claim.  It was also  apparent
    that the  appellant's  solicitors  were  not  initially  aware  of  the
    decision, which was why they had chased (see page 70 AB).  The FtT  had
    failed to analyse this adequately when drawing  adverse  inferences  on
    the basis of a lack of an  appeal  and  late  correspondence  from  the
    appellant's solicitors, as somehow indicating that he might be  outside
    the UK.

19. It was further  impermissible  for  the  FtT  to  have  restricted  her
    analysis of the appellant's private life  claim  by  reference  to  the
    Immigration Rules, without a wider free-standing Article 8 analysis.

The respondent's submissions

20. Mr Bates reminded me that the burden of  proving  continuous  residence
    lay with the appellant.  The respondent did not have to prove, nor  did
    the FtT have to make findings, that the appellant had left the  UK  and
    in any event, it was certainly  not  irrational  to  entertain  such  a
    possibility.  Just as  the  appellant  had  entered  the  UK  on  false
    identity documents, it was quite possible that he might have sought  to
    leave the UK clandestinely, particularly as he would not necessarily be
    doing so to return to his country of origin, India, but  had  lived  in
    Germany for the  four  years  prior  to  coming  to  the  UK.   In  the
    circumstances, he may well have decided to 'try his  luck'  in  leaving
    the UK and the respondent was unlikely to be in the position to be able
    to prove this, particularly in the context of  someone  using  a  false
    identity.

21.  The  "ARC  issue  was  a  red-herring.  The  appellant's  own  witness
    statement, �3, page 1 AB referred specifically to "when  I  arrived  in
    the UK I gave my name and date of birth incorrectly...and that is  what
    is written on my asylum documents issued to  me  at  the  time  and  my
    Asylum Registration Card (ARC)."  Whilst the FtT may have  referred  to
    the ARC card issued later, his analysis remained accurate; even if  not
    an ARC card and  under  an  assumed  name,  the  appellant  had  asylum
    documentation, on his own case, issued at the time in 1998 and  it  was
    not irrational for the FtT to  have  considered  the  absence  of  such
    records or documentary evidence of working, even if illegally and under
    an assumed name.

22. In relation to the issue of not following  up  on  his  refused  asylum
    claim, if the appellant's case was that he  had  been  unaware  of  the
    decision for  a  year,  the  FtT  was  entitled  to  consider  why  his
    representatives had not informed him, and if  they  claimed  ignorance,
    how this was consistent with the GCID record confirming delivery of the
    decision to them nearly a year earlier. If it were now suggested he had
    not been aware for a year because his solicitors had not informed  him,
    there was no evidence from the appellant's solicitors at the time as to
    their delay (if at all) in informing the appellant.

23. The FtT reached her summary, at �28, which was based  on  adequate  and
    sustainable reasons. The challenge on the basis  of  irrationality  did
    not begin to get off the ground and the FtT unarguably  considered  the
    evidence in the round. The FtT was entitled to consider the appellant's
    use of a false identity,  not  because  this  made  him  ineligible  on
    grounds of suitability (the refusal had not been on that basis) but  as
    a factor in assessing the appellant's credibility and  ZH  (Bangladesh)
    did not prevent this.

24. Even if it were suggested, in relation to the remainder of the  private
    life claim, that the FtT  had  impermissibly  applied  the  Immigration
    Rules as a structure,  rather  than  a  starting  point,  the  FtT  had
    nevertheless gone on to carry out, at ��46 to 52,  a  classic  'Razgar'
    analysis in relation to proportionality and there  was  nothing  beyond
    the  fact  of  extended  residence  in  the  UK,  which  supported  the
    appellant's claim.



Analysis and conclusions

25. Dealing first of all with ground (2),  I do not  accept  that  the  FtT
    erred in impermissibly imposing an additional requirement  either  that
    the appellant was in the UK every single  day  from  1998;  that  there
    should be evidence of a formal nature as to such presence; or that  the
    FtT had failed to consider all of the evidence in the  round.  What  is
    clear  from  the  concluding  paragraph,  �28,  is  that  the  FtT  had
    considered all of the evidence in the round and was  conscious  not  to
    look  for  or  expect  official  documentation,  but,  as  many  Judges
    considering the same issue will need to do, she considered the  nuances
    of  the  available  evidence  including  the  reliability  of   witness
    evidence; the  gaps  in  evidence,  and  whether  such  gaps  might  be
    explicable.   At �28, the FtT stated:

         "Having considered the evidence, individually and in the  round,  I
         am not satisfied that the appellant has discharged  the  burden  of
         proof that he has been continuously present in the  United  Kingdom
         since 1998. I am not satisfied  that  the  witnesses  accounts  are
         reliable because of the inconsistencies about where he  was  living
         and their lack of knowledge of his London address. The appellant in
         evidence stated he had lived at the London address in 2002 but none
         of his witnesses knew that. There  are  gaps  in  their  knowledge.
         There is a paucity of independent documentary evidence  to  support
         his claim which is remarkable given he claims to have been here for
         more than 20 years. He made no attempt to contact the  Home  Office
         about his outstanding asylum claim from 1998 to 2010  and  made  no
         attempt to alert Home Office that he had given  a  false  name  and
         date of birth until 2010. He has failed to account for why  he  did
         not chase this matter up sooner if he was  in  the  United  Kingdom
         seeking asylum because he was in fear of his life if returned. This
         along with his lack of knowledge of the refusal of his asylum claim
         and the permission to work granted in 2014  leads  me  to  conclude
         that this part of his appeal must fail.

26. I am conscious that the bar for a challenge of irrationality to succeed
    is a high one and to iterate again it was clear that the FtT considered
    not only the  documentary  evidence  but  the  oral  witness  evidence,
    including that of the appellant, which she referred to at �16.  The FtT
    was unarguably entitled to  require  the  appellant  to  discharge  the
    burden of proof in relation to continuous residence,  and  it  was  not
    necessary, as Mr Nasim at one stage suggested before me, for the FtT to
    make findings on specific periods of time when the appellant might have
    been outside the UK; where he might have gone, and the means  by  which
    he left the UK, when practically, it was unlikely that a person who had
    left  the  UK  clandestinely  would  volunteer  such  evidence  to  the
    respondent or the FtT.

27. Not only did the FtT correctly require the appellant to  discharge  the
    burden of proof, but in my view, did so by applying the ordinary  civil
    standard, assessing informal evidence, including oral witness evidence,
    on a nuanced and holistic basis, as reflected in �28.

28. Dealing with the criticism of the FtT at the various points set out  in
    ground (2), first of all it was suggested the reference to the  ARC  at
    �20 must be erroneous because ARCs were not first  issued  until  2002,
    many years after the appellant first claimed asylum in 1998.   However,
    it is worth examining again what �20 says:

         "The appellant  asserts  that  he  has  been  unable  to  supply  a
         sufficiency of documentary evidence to support his claim as he  did
         not have identification documents to  allow  him  to  open  a  bank
         account or obtain any other service. I do not accept that. Whilst I
         accept the arrived in the UK in 1998 without documents, as the Home
         Office record show, he had claimed asylum and would have been given
         an ARC card to allow him to obtain services. I remind  myself  that
         the appellant is capable and resourceful. He managed to travel  all
         the way to the United Kingdom in 1998 and was prepared  to  deceive
         the authorities here about his true identity. He stated orally that
         he came to the UK from Germany  and  that  he  produced  a  driving
         licence with a false name and date of birth on it which  was  taken
         by the UKBA upon arrival. He has failed  to  provide  any  evidence
         that he could not  have  obtained  documents  to  verify  his  true
         identity from the Indian authorities before 3 July 2019 when he was
         issued with a passport."

29. I accept the force of Mr Bates's submission that taking the appellant's
    own witness statement, the appellant stated at  �3  that  he  had  been
    issued with an asylum document on claiming asylum in 1998, as  well  as
    an ARC at a later date, and the FtT was unarguably entitled to consider
    that the possession of such asylum document, even if the  FtT  referred
    to the  document as an ARC, could have enabled him to obtain  services,
    which would then generate further records.

30. In relation to the further criticism of the FtT at �21 in  relation  to
    the appellant only seeking the right to work in 2014  and  only  having
    worked from time to time, once again, the FtT's  comments  reflect  the
    appellant's evidence,  on  his  own  case,  that  he  had  registration
    documents, even if under a false name, since  1998,  and  the  FtT  was
    entitled to draw an inference (which was by no means  determinative  of
    the appellant's appeal) that given his possession of such documentation
    and having worked, the absence of any records  relating  to  such  work
    were an omission which had a bearing on the appellant's claim  to  have
    been continuously resident in the UK.  In my view, that  was  a  factor
    that the FtT  was  entitled  to  take  into  account  and  it  was  not
    irrational for the FtT to have done so.

31. In relation to the criticism of the FtT's reasoning  at  �23  that  the
    lack of an appeal by the appellant after  his  asylum  application  was
    refused cast doubt on  his  whereabouts,  it  is  clear  that  the  FTT
    considered at �22 the chronology of events; the decision  refusing  the
    asylum  claim  in  December   2014,   about   which   the   appellant's
    representatives were sent, and signed  for,  the  decision  in  January
    2015, but afterwards chased for  an  update  nearly  a  year  later  in
    December 2015; and the appellant also chased for an update.   In  these
    circumstances, the FtT was entitled to consider why there  was  such  a
    delay, particularly  when  the  appellant's  representatives  had  been
    informed as early as January 2015.  The FtT specifically considered the
    possibility that the appellant's solicitors may have failed  to  inform
    the appellant, but he had "failed to provide any evidence from them  to
    support his claim or any lack of knowledge of it."

32. Mr Nasim suggests that the GCID records before the FtT  indicated  that
    the appellant's solicitors may  have  been  unaware  of  the  decision.
    However, as Mr Bates, in my view correctly, submitted it  was  open  to
    the appellant to have adduced evidence from his  former  solicitors  to
    that effect, and yet he had failed to do so, either by confirming  that
    they were unaware of the decision or had, through negligence, failed to
    inform the appellant. The FtT was entitled to  take  into  account  the
    absence of such potentially available evidence, as part of an  holistic
    assessment, particularly  in  the  context  of  the  paucity  of  other
    documentary evidence.   The  drawing  of  such  an  inference  was  not
    perverse.

33. In relation to the challenge based on  the  FtT's  concerns  about  the
    appellant's witnesses, who were tendered as support for his  contention
    that he was continuously living in the UK, while  Mr  Nasim  criticises
    the interpretation of the witness evidence as being that they had lived
    with him continuously, that ignores what the FtT was entitled  to  take
    into account, namely that if the witnesses were tendered as  supporting
    about the appellant's continuous presence in the UK but were unaware of
    his changed oral evidence that he had lived in London for a period,  it
    was just as possible that the appellant was living outside the UK,  and
    the witnesses, however honest, would have been similarly unaware.   The
    FtT reflected that not only Ms Kaur, but both Mr Suhbinder Singh  Tanda
    and Rapinder Singh Tanda were unaware that the appellant had  lived  in
    London (�18). The FtT regarded the gaps in their knowledge as a factor,
    alongside a number of other factors in �28, which I  have  already  set
    out above.  The FtT was, in my view, unarguably entitled to  take  into
    account the gaps in the witnesses' knowledge of the  appellant's  home,
    for a  period,  however  genuine  those  witnesses  might  be,  in  the
    assessment of the appellant's continuous residence.

34. In relation to the challenge in relation to the FtT's  reasoning  about
    the absence of GP records, it is important to note that the FtT did not
    suggest that simply because there was a gap in the GP records, that the
    appellant was untruthful.  It is important,  once  again,  to  consider
    what the FtT did state, at ��24 to 25:

         "24. The GP medical records and NHS medical  cards  show  that  the
         appellant was issued with an NHS medical card on 27th  of  February
         2003 and again on 14 March 2008. He was  given  an  NHS  blood  and
         transplant letter on 17 October 2010. With the exception  of  these
         items, the appellant has not been able to  supply  a  copy  of  his
         medical records for the period before 2012. This means  that  there
         are large gaps from 1998 to 2003; from 2003  until  2008  and  from
         2008 to 2010. I accept that the appellant was present in the United
         Kingdom at the time he registered for  NHS  care  but  without  the
         records showing the consultations with his GP, I am not prepared to
         accept these  cards  and  letters  provide  much  support  for  his
         continuous residence in the UK.

         25.  The appellant has produced  his  medical  records  from  2012.
         These show consultations  with  his  GP  intermittently  from  2012
         onwards and go some way to substantiated his claim...."

35. The FtT was not discounting the records in their entirety  or  ignoring
    the fact of the GP registration in 2003. What the  FtT  was  doing  was
    placing more limited weight upon them because of the  substantial  gaps
    over many years whilst still noting that records  could,  in  part,  go
    some way to substantiating his claim. Once again, I find that that  was
    an analysis unarguably open to the FtT to make  and  the  challenge  on
    grounds of irrationality does not begin to succeed.

36. In relation to  the  final  element  of  the  perversity  challenge  in
    relation to ground (2), the FtT did not in my  err  in  dismissing  the
    appeal  because  of  the  appellant's  use  of  an  assumed   identity,
    particularly where as here,  there  was  no  challenge  on  suitability
    grounds. Instead, what the FtT did clearly, at �28, was to consider why
    the appellant would not have  sought  to  admit  his  use  of  a  false
    identity until 2010, when he had already made an asylum claim in  1998.
    She also took into account the fact that the appellant had  not  chased
    up on resolution of his asylum claim during the same  12  year  period.
    The FtT was in my view unarguably entitled to take both into account as
    relevant factors and this was not in breach  of  the  authority  of  ZH
    (Bangladesh).

37. I deal with grounds (3) and (4) together, the first asserting that  the
    FtT  had  failed  to  consider  the  appellant's  documentary  evidence
    holistically, particularly in seeking formal documents; and the  second
    challenges the lack of findings on the appellant's oral evidence.   The
    answer to both challenges is the analysis at ��13 to 17, which leads up
    to the conclusions in �28. Those conclusions referred expressly to  the
    evidence in the round, by reference to a number of  factors,  including
    the witness  evidence  of  supporters  and  the  inconsistency  in  the
    appellant's account, as recorded at �16 and which required an  analysis
    of the appellant's oral evidence, beyond documentary evidence  (whether
    formal or otherwise).  Neither of the grounds discloses  any  error  of
    law in the FtT's reasoning or conclusions and it  was  clear  that  the
    evidence was considered from a variety of sources  (witnesses;  wedding
    photographs and a marriage certificate; GCID notes; GP notes;  and  the
    appellant's current Indian passport).

38. In relation to the grounds (5) and (6) and the challenge to the Article
    8 ECHR assessment, I noted, on the one hand,  the  FtT's  analysis  by
    reference to the Rules (specifically paragraph 276ADE) at �� 30 to  36;
    and at [44], the FtT's comment that if the appellant could not meet the
    Rules, barring exceptional or compelling circumstances, it was unlikely
    that a different outcome would result from a proportionality  exercise.
    Nevertheless, on the other hand, the FtT did then go in to  consider  a
    classic "balance-sheet" exercise, as endorsed  by  Hesham  Ali,  taking
    into account the statutory factors required by Sections 117A and  B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, at ��46 to 53.  These
    included the neutral factors of the lack of proficiency in English  and
    the lack of financial independence;  the  limited  weight  attached  to
    private life developed in the UK; the absence of family life in the UK;
    an acceptance  of  private  life  in  the  UK  and  the  refusal  being
    interference of such  gravity  to  engage  Article  8,  but  the  FtT's
    conclusion that the interference was  proportionate.  When  considering
    the FtT's  reasoning  by  reference  to  the  Immigration  Rules,  that
    reasoning has to be considered in the wider  context  of  the  analysis
    outside the Immigration Rules, in a proportionality assessment that  is
    adequately  explained  and  discloses  no  error  of   law.    In   the
    circumstances,  both  grounds  (5)  and  (6)  take  references  to  the
    Immigration Rules  outside  that  wider  context.  When  considered  in
    context, the criticisms are not sustainable.
