For the Appellant:     Mr Tom Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Taj Shah of Taj Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant (hereafter the ECO) appeals against the decisions of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Davda)  allowing  the  respondents'  appeal
    against a decision taken on 14 August 2013 and later  confirmed  by  an
    entry clearance manager on 14 October 2014 to  refuse  entry  clearance
    for settlement following an application made on 20 May 2013. There  are
    two decisions but they are materially identical, save for  the  details
    of the respondents.

Introduction

 3. The first respondent is a citizen of  Bangladesh  born  on  9  February
    1995. The second respondent is also a citizen of Bangladesh, born on  9
    February 1999. The sponsor is their mother, Mrs Khatun,  who  is  a  UK
    citizen. Her husband, Mr Miah ("the  father")  and  their  eldest  son,
    Sakib, have been granted leave to remain in the UK until 13 March 2016.
    The respondents were left in Pakistan because the sponsor's income  was
    at that time inadequate to support an application for the whole family.
    Mr Miah works in the UK and is a second sponsor for financial purposes.



 4. The ECO considered the applications under paragraph 297 and Appendix FM
    of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules"). The respondents had  failed  to
    submit the specified documents in relation to the sponsors' employments
    (6 months wage slips).  It  was  unclear  who  was  looking  after  the
    respondents and there was no reason why the family could not move  back
    to Bangladesh. There were no exceptional circumstances.

The Appeal

 5. The respondents appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  sponsor
    attended an oral hearing at Taylor House on 14 April  2015.  They  were
    represented by Ms R Akther, Counsel. The First-tier Tribunal noted that
    the Home Office Presenting  Officer  conceded  that  the  sponsors  now
    earned a total of ï¿½28,080 per year but the documents  were  not  before
    the ECO. The judge found that the financial requirements of Appendix FM
    were met and that the father and Sakib had been in the UK  since  2011.
    The sponsor had sole responsibility for the respondents and there  were
    serious and compelling reasons which made  exclusion  undesirable.  The
    sponsor   and   the   father   had   temporarily   delegated   parental
    responsibility to an uncle but he died on 13 March  2014.  Since  then,
    the respondents had been  looked  after  by  an  aging  paternal  step-
    grandmother. The appeals were allowed under  the  Rules  and  on  human
    rights grounds.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  in
    finding that the respondents met the requirements  of  the  Rules.  The
    sponsor could not have sole responsibility because  both  parents  were
    involved in the upbringing  of  the  children,  the  judge  incorrectly
    stated that the 6 month period for assessing the  finances  was  April-
    October rather than the 6 month period prior to the application and the
    judge sought to water down the clearly high threshold in paragraph  297
    by suggesting that the test was no more than a question  of  where  the
    best interests of the children lay.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ransley
    on 13 July 2015. The judge had arguably erred in  taking  into  account
    evidence that post-dated the decision by 7 months and appeared to  have
    confused serious and compelling circumstances with best interests.  The
    decision included material inconsistencies and arguable errors of  law.
    Permission was granted on all grounds.

 8. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

 9. Mr Wilding relied upon the grounds of appeal and submitted  that  there
    were at least two clear errors of law. However, following  discussions,
    it was also clear that everyone had missed the obvious point. As at the
    date of decision the sponsor had British citizenship and the father was
    in the UK as her spouse, entry clearance granted in 2011. The  father's
    application for indefinite leave to remain as a spouse was made in time
    and so he has section 3C leave under the 1971 Act. He had leave with  a
    view to settlement, under paragraph 281 of  the  Rules.  Paragraph  301
    avoids the problems with paragraph 297 of the Rules.  The  ECO  muddied
    the waters by considering Appendix FM.  Maintenance  and  accommodation
    should have been considered under KA and those requirements  were  met.
    Paragraph 301(i)(a) applies and the requirements were  met  as  at  the
    date of decision.

10. Mr Shah agreed that the requirements of paragraph 301 were  met  as  at
    the date of decision. Appendix FM did not apply.  In  the  alternative,
    there are compassionate grounds and Article 8 is engaged. Both  parties
    agreed that I should set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    and remake the decision by allowing the appeal under paragraph 301.

11. Paragraph 301(i)(a) of the Rules states that the requirements to be met
    by a person seeking limited leave to  enter  the  UK  with  a  view  to
    settlement as the child of a parent given limited  leave  to  enter  or
    remain are that one parent is present and settled in  the  UK  and  the
    other parent is being or has been given limited leave to enter  the  UK
    with a view to settlement. Those requirements are met  by  the  sponsor
    and father. The remaining relevant requirements of paragraph  301  (age
    and  lack  of  independence  of  the   respondents,   maintenance   and
    accommodation) are also met. I find that leave  to  enter  should  have
    been granted by the appellant under paragraph 301 of  the  Rules.  Both
    parties concur.

12. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  various  material
    errors  of  law.  The  judge's  finding  that  the  sponsor  had   sole
    responsibility is a material error of law  because  it  is  clear  that
    responsibility was shared between both parents.  The  judge  materially
    erred in relation to the relevant period for financial  evidence  under
    Appendix FM and in any  event  Appendix  FM  did  not  apply  to  these
    applications.  The judge further erred in law by equating  the  serious
    and compelling family or other considerations test from  paragraph  297
    of the Rules to the best interests of the respondents. Article 8 has no
    application because the respondents meet the requirements of  paragraph
    301 of the Rules. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow the
    respondent's appeal under the Rules and Article 8 involved  the  making
    of an error of law and its decision cannot stand.

Decision

13. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    remake the decision by allowing the appeals of  the  respondents  under
    paragraph 301 of the Immigration Rules.
