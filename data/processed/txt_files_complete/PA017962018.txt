                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is the claimant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, brought with  the
    permission of a Judge of the Upper Tribunal, from  a  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the tribunal) which it  made  on  14  March  2018,
    following a hearing of 7 March 2018, and which it sent to  the  parties
    on 27 March 2018. The tribunal decided to dismiss the claimant's appeal
    from the Secretary of State's decision of 26 January 2018  refusing  to
    grant him international protection. The claimant was granted  anonymity
    by the tribunal and, although nothing was said about that  one  way  or
    the other before me, I have decided it would be appropriate to maintain
    the status quo and to continue that grant.

2.    The claimant is a national of  Afghanistan  and  he  was  born  on  30
    December 1998. He obtained a student visa whilst abroad and entered the
    United Kingdom (UK) on 2 February 2017  with  leave  until  26  October
    2020. In September 2017 he travelled to Afghanistan and returned  on  3
    October 2017. On that date he claimed asylum asserting that he  was  of
    adverse interest to the Taliban because they believed he had  converted
    to Christianity and was a spy. He said that his father had  been  taken
    by the Taliban from the family home in Logar Province, but that he (the
    claimant) had been able to flee and had flown back to the UK.

3.    The Secretary of State disbelieved  the  claimant  but  the  tribunal,
    having heard from him and on the  basis  of  a  thorough  and  balanced
    written evaluation, accepted the truth of the  account  he  had  given.
    Having made it plain that it did believe him the tribunal  went  on  to
    indicate,  at  paragraph  47  of  its  written  reasons,  that  it  was
    "satisfied that the appellant has proof to the lower standard  that  he
    is a refugee as defined by regulation 2". Further, the tribunal said at
    paragraph 53 of  its  written  reasons  that  it  thought  "the  Afghan
    authorities are unable, though willing, to provide effective protection
    in Afghanistan".  It then observed  at  paragraph  55  of  its  written
    reasons "the only  way  the  appellant  might  safely  be  returned  to
    Afghanistan is if he returned to an area where he could not be  located
    by the Taliban". At paragraph 56 it went on to make it  clear  that  it
    did not consider he could be safely returned to his home area.  But  it
    did ask itself whether he would be able to live  safely  in  Kabul  and
    whether requiring him to internally locate there would be unduly  harsh
    or unreasonable. At paragraph 59 it expressed a view that if he were to
    relocate to Kabul "it would be more difficult for the Taliban to  track
    him". At paragraph 61 it noted that the Taliban had not  been  able  to
    track the claimant down after he had fled his home area and added  "nor
    were they able to do so when his brother returned to Kabul  on  October
    02 2017 after collecting the  appellant's  belongings".  It  noted  the
    Country Guidance decision of the Upper Tribunal in  AK  (Article  15(c)
    Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163 (IAC) to the effect that, in  general,
    a return to Kabul would not be unsafe or unreasonable. At paragraph  63
    of the written reasons it said "in my judgment, for the reasons I  have
    identified above, the appellant would not have a well-founded  fear  of
    persecution in Kabul. He has not proved that to  the  lower  standard".
    Then, at paragraph 64, it said this:

         "64.     I next considered whether he can reasonably be expected to
         stay in Kabul. Whether, in effect  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
         require him to relocate. I am not satisfied that the appellant  has
         proved to the lower  standard  that  he  could  not  reasonably  be
         expected to stay in Kabul and that it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to
         require him to relocate for the following reasons:


          i) He is a healthy young man of nineteen years of age;


         ii) He has shown the capacity to relocate to  a  foreign  country,
             the UK. He could deploy that capacity to relocate to Kabul;


        iii) He is well-educated and  speaks  several  languages  (he  gave
             evidence in Pushtu  and  answered  questions  in  his  Tier  4
             interview in English);


         iv) His family appear to have  access  to  considerable  financial
             resources (they were  able  to  pay  �9000  tuition  fees  and
             maintain an account with a balance of �26307.00 as recorded on
             the Tier 4 application form);


          v) The appellant has at least one relation in Kabul, the uncle he
             stayed with in 2017; and


         vi) The appellant mentioned in his Tier 4 interview that there was
             a  demand  for  educated  individuals  in  the  workforce   in
             Afghanistan.


         65.      In summary, I am not satisfied - even though I have  found
         that the appellant meets the definition of a  refugee  -  that  the
         appellant has discharged his burden and  proved  that  his  removal
         from the UK would breach the UK's  obligations  under  the  Refugee
         Conventions as set out in the IR".


4.    Some of the above might seem confusing. I shall say  more  about  that
    below. But an  application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal followed the  issuing  of  the  tribunal's  decision.  It  was
    contended in the grounds (in summary) that the tribunal  had  erred  in
    failing to allow the appeal having concluded that he met the definition
    of a "refugee"; had erred in failing to allow the appeal given that  it
    had found there to be an insufficiency of  protection  in  Afghanistan;
    had erred in providing an inadequate explanation as to why  it  thought
    the claimant could relocate to Kabul; and had  erred  in  applying  the
    above Country Guidance  decision  without  addressing  some  background
    country material which contained indications that it should,  in  fact,
    depart from it. Permission to appeal was initially refused but such was
    granted on renewal. The granting Judge relevantly said this:

         "2.      It is correct that the Judge found that the appellant  was
         credible and in paragraph 47 found that he was a refugee and had  a
         well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of his  perceived
         religion.  She  then  also  found  that  protection  would  not  be
         available and that the appellant could not return to his home area.
         She does appear to find that internal relocation was  open  to  the
         appellant and that the appellant could relocate to Kabul  and  that
         it would be reasonable to expect him to  stay  there.  However,  in
         paragraph 67 the Judge again states that she is satisfied that  the
         appellant qualifies as a refugee.


         3. While it is clear that the Judge  was  correctly  looking  at  a
         stage-by-stage approach, her terminology is confusing and  although
         it is clear what she meant to say her repeated assertion  that  the
         appellant is a  refugee  is  arguably  an  error  of  law.  I  will
         therefore grant permission".


5.    Permission having been granted, the case  was  listed  for  a  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal (before me)  so  that  it  could  be  decided
    whether or not the tribunal had actually erred in law, and if had, what
    should flow from that. Representation at that  hearing  was  as  stated
    above and I am grateful to each representative. Mr Howard  relied  upon
    all of the written grounds but, primarily, focussed upon  the  argument
    that the tribunal had said, in terms, it was finding the claimant to be
    a refugee yet had still dismissed his appeal. Additionally,  argued  Mr
    Howard, the tribunal had failed to properly explain its  rationale  for
    concluding that the Taliban's reach did not extend into Kabul. Mr Mills
    said that the tribunal had got itself into a muddle  but  that  it  was
    clear what it was deciding. It  was  deciding  he  was  not  a  refugee
    because  he  was  able  to  take  advantage  of  an   internal   flight
    alternative. As to the viability of internal flight  it  had  said  all
    that was necessary.

6.    I have decided  that,  although  it  expressed  itself  clumsily,  the
    tribunal did not err in law. I shall now explain why.

7.    First of all, it is readily apparent from a reading of the  tribunal's
    written reasons that it was not, in fact, deciding  that  the  claimant
    fulfilled all of the criteria he would need to do in order for  him  to
    be a refugee. It was finding that he was at risk of persecution  for  a
    1951 Refugee Convention reason (that of religion) in his home area (the
    Logar Province in Afghanistan). It was finding that there would not  be
    a  sufficiency  of  protection  from  the   authorities   anywhere   in
    Afghanistan (I think including Kabul). It was  finding,  however,  that
    the Taliban members who had antipathy towards him would not be able  to
    locate him in Kabul. It was finding, therefore, that he would  be  safe
    in Kabul. Finally, it was finding that requiring him  to  go  to  Kabul
    would not be unduly harsh or unreasonable. Clearly, a person is  not  a
    refugee if that person has an internal flight alternative available  to
    him and it is not unreasonable to expect him to avail himself  of  that
    alternative. So, despite the tribunal saying (I accept more than  once)
    that it was finding the claimant  to  be  a  refugee  it  was  not,  in
    substance, doing so. That is the only way in which its written  reasons
    can sensibly be read. Indeed,  that  understanding  of  the  tribunal's
    meaning is consistent with the outcome of the appeal.

8.    The tribunal did find, as indicated, that the claimant would not  have
    a sufficiency of protection in Afghanistan. However, contrary  to  what
    seems to be contended in the written grounds, it did  not  follow  from
    that, that the appeal should succeed. A claimant might have enemies  in
    a particular country and might lack protection  from  the  authorities.
    But if there is a part of the country to which the claimant is able  to
    go and  where  his  enemies  will  be  unable  to  trace  him,  then  a
    sufficiency of protection is not necessary for that person to be  safe.
    Essentially, the tribunal had concluded that that was the position with
    respect to this claimant because his enemies would not be able to trace
    him  in  Kabul.  I  can  understand  why  Mr  Howard  argues  that  the
    explanation as to why his enemies would not be able to track  him  down
    in Kabul was insufficient. It addressed the  matter  only  briefly,  in
    specific terms,  at  paragraph  59  of  its  written  reasons.  But  at
    paragraph 61 it fleshed  out  its  reasoning  by  explaining  that  his
    enemies in the Taliban had not been able to trace  him  at  an  earlier
    stage when there had been an opportunity to do so. Further, and in  any
    event, there was nothing in the claimant's case as put  to  suggest  he
    had drawn anything other  than  antipathy  from  local  people.  In  my
    judgment it was open to the tribunal to find that his enemies would not
    be able to track him down in Kabul and its explanation as to why it was
    so finding was adequate if not obviously very much more than that.

9.    The tribunal, having found that the claimant would be  safe  from  his
    enemies in Kabul, also found it would not be unduly harsh to expect him
    to go there. It explained its reasoning as to that, at paragraph 64  of
    its written reasons. It relied upon a number of factors  which,  in  my
    judgment, amply justified its overall conclusion. Finally,  as  to  the
    safety of relocation to Kabul, it applied Country Guidance  as  it  was
    required to do. It cannot be faulted  for  that.  There  was  no  clear
    evidential basis  to  persuade  it  to  do  otherwise  given  the  high
    threshold which must be reached before Country Guidance may be departed
    from.

10.   In light of the above I have concluded that  the  tribunal's  decision
    does not have shortcomings other than its misleading description of the
    claimant as being a refugee when in fact and in substance  it  was  not
    finding that he is not one. So, I have concluded that the tribunal  did
    not err in law. That has the consequence that the claimant's appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal must be dismissed.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law. Accordingly, that decision shall stand and this appeal to  the
Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal granted the claimant anonymity. I  have  decided  to
continue that grant. Accordingly, no report of these proceedings shall  name
or otherwise identify the claimant or any member of his family.  This  grant
applies to all parties to the proceedings. Failure to  comply  may  lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.
