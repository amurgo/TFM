                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Mrs Bushra Sultana, date of birth 19  July  1982,  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan. Having considered the circumstances I do not  make
    an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant against the determination of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Herwald promulgated on 19th March 2014.  The  judge
    dismissed the appeal of the appellant  against  the  decisions  of  the
    respondent dated 19th December 2013 to  refuse  the  appellant  further
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom and to remove the appellant  from
    the United Kingdom to Pakistan.

 3. The original application to the respondent was on the  basis  that  the
    appellant was seeking to remain to help to care  for  her  sister,  who
    suffers from a mental illness. That was the basis upon which  the  case
    was advanced in the First-tier Tribunal. It now appears that that is no
    longer the basis on which the appellant is seeking to  remain.  In  the
    latest bundle submitted for the appeal the appellant makes reference to
    a husband and seeking to  remain  because  of  that  relationship.  The
    appellant married in April 2014.

Preliminary issue

 4. There was no attendance by the appellant. Notice of  hearing  had  been
    sent out on 15 July 2014 to the address given for the appellant and the
    appellant's sister.

 5. By letter received on or about  the  13th  August  2014  the  appellant
    stated that she had moved to an address in  London  to  live  with  her
    husband in London. The appellant asked that her appeal be dealt with on
    the papers. Accompanying that letter was a bundle  of  documents.  Many
    relate to the appellant's husband, his job and the  appellant  and  her
    husband living in the London area. Included in the documentation  is  a
    claim that the appellant's husband earns in excess of ï¿½18,600 and  that
    the appeal should be allowed by reason thereof.

 6. The Tribunal Administration replied on the same day  stating  that  the
    appeal would proceed as listed. Thus the appeal came before  me  on  27
    August 2014. In the circumstances I am satisfied that it  is  just  and
    proper to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the  appellant.  I
    am satisfied that the appeal can be determined  on  the  basis  of  the
    documentation currently before the Tribunal.

Error of law

 7. As stated this is an appeal by the appellant against the  determination
    of Judge  Herwald. On the 2 July 2014 permission to appeal was  granted
    by Judge McWilliam in the following terms: --

         4 Having considered the determination it appears  to  me  that  the
         judge may have failed to take into consideration all of the medical
         evidence relating to the appellant's sister. Dr Anisoke in a letter
         of the 23 July 2013 describes the support she gives to  her  sister
         as ' invaluable ' and that  not  having  the  support  would  '  be
         detrimental to her overall health'. There is also a letter from  Dr
         Gallagher of 17 June 2013.

         5 There is an arguable error of law.

 8. The appellant had entered the United Kingdom as a visitor in July  2009
    with leave valid until 4 January 2010. The  appellant  had  overstayed.
    The appellant applied and was granted leave  on  25  October  2011  for
    three months to enable her to put into place arrangements for the  care
    of her sister, who had a  mental  disorder.  On  24  January  2012  the
    appellant applied for further leave to remain for the same reason. This
    was refused on 5 March  2013.  The  respondent  agreed  to  review  the
    decision after an appeal.

 9.  The original application does not specify what basis the appellant  is
    seeking to remain in the United Kingdom.  However  correspondence  from
    her legal representatives at he time indicate that she  is  seeking  to
    remain on the basis of her sister's, Sadia Sultana, mental illness  and
    need for the appellant to care for the sister.

10. In the determination in paragraph 21 the judge has  carefully  set  out
    the illness of the  sister.  It  is  described  as  a  schizo-affective
    disorder. The judge has carefully assessed not only the  condition  but
    in paragraphs 21 to 25 set out the level of care that is in place  with
    regard to the sister from various agencies.  The  judge  has  carefully
    assessed the degree of support the sister required and is receiving.

11. The judge has carefully noted that the appellant had had  an  extension
    of stay on two occasions to be given an opportunity to put in place any
    further arrangements for the care of her sister.

12. On the documentation now submitted by the appellant it appears that the
    appellant is no longer living or caring for her sister but has  married
    and is seeking to remain on the basis  of  her  relationship  with  her
    husband. At the time of the original application and at the time of the
    hearing before the judge no reference appears to have been made to such
    a  relationship  or  marriage,  indeed  in  the  application  form  the
    appellant was claiming to be single.

13. The only basis upon which the matter was advanced before the first-tier
    was on the basis that the sister required the care  of  the  appellant.
    That clearly is not now the case as the appellant is no  longer  living
    with the sister.

14. However that is not the issue, the issue was whether or not  the  judge
    in assessing the facts as properly assessed the rights of  the  parties
    under the immigration rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

15. There are provisions in the rules for  carers  to  be  given  leave  to
    remain in the United  Kingdom.  The  appellant  had  been  given  leave
    appropriate to the needs of the sister to enable the appellant  to  put
    in place with the  cooperation  of  the  medical  services  and  social
    services proper care. The judge clearly assessed that and was satisfied
    that there was no need for the appellant provide immediate care to  her
    sister, which now appears to be justified by the  appellant  moving  to
    live with her husband. I put aside such considerations as they were not
    before the original Judge.

16. There is no right to have a care of a specific type or  by  a  specific
    family member under either the immigration rules or under article 8  of
    the ECHR.

17. The cases of Haleemudeen 2014 EWCA Civ 558 and MM  2014  EWCA  Civ  985
    make clear that the immigration rules are article 8 compliant and  will
    cover the majority of situations, in which an individual can succeed on
    the basis of family and private life including in this appeal providing
    care to a family member.

18.  The  judge  has  considered  all  the  circumstances  with  care   and
    acknowledged that where a family member is ill one may have empathy  or
    sympathy with such. However that  does  not  entitle  as  of  right  an
    individual to a specific type of care or care by a family member.

19. The judge has carefully  assessed  the  position  with  regard  to  the
    immigration rules and  has  given  valid  reasons  for  coming  to  the
    conclusion that the appellant does not meet  the  requirements  of  the
    rules.

20. The judge has gone on  to  assess  the  issues  under  article  8.  The
    appellant who had not been living with her sister came  to  the  United
    Kingdom as a visitor and could have no expectation of being entitled to
    remain. She had been given leave  to  remain  as  a  carer  but  for  a
    specific limited basis to enable proper care to be put  in  place.  The
    judge considered the help and assistance that was already  provided  to
    the sister and was satisfied taking all the factors into  account  that
    the needs of the sister were being properly met. In light of that there
    was no basis upon which it can be said that the appellant was needed to
    be in the United Kingdom to care for her sister.

21. On the facts as presented the  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that
    article 8 family and private life was  not  engaged  on  the  facts  as
    presented. Even if it was engaged on the facts as presented  the  judge
    has gone on and concluded that  in  this  case  the  decisions  by  the
    respondent were proportionately justified. The judge has  assessed  all
    the facts and was entitled to come to the decision that he did.

22. With regard to the appellants present position of seeking to remain now
    on the basis of  her  relationship  to  her  husband  that  is  not  an
    application that was before the judge or that the judge considered.  It
    cannot be a basis for challenging the decision by  the  judge.  If  the
    appellant wishes to pursue such she will have to make an application on
    that basis. It may be that the appellant will have  to  return  to  her
    home country to make that application. However that is  not  the  basis
    upon which the present decision can be challenged.

23. The judge has fully justified his decision both under  the  immigration
    rules and on article 8 grounds.  There  is  no  error  of  law  in  the
    decision. The decision to dismiss this appeal on all grounds stands.
