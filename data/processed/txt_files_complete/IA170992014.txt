Representation:
Appellant   Not present
Respondent  Mr Harrison (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria.  The background to this case is
    that the appellant was refused  permission  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  points  based
    system on March 18, 2014. She appealed that decision on April  9,  2014
    under section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002.

 2. The matter was heard by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Grant  on
    November 24, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on December 5, 2015 the
    Tribunal refused her appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The appellant applied for permission to appeal  on  December  16,  2014
    submitting the Tribunal had erred. Permission to appeal was granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Osborne on January  28,  2015  on  the
    basis that the Tribunal may have  misunderstood  the  appellant's  oral
    evidence.

 4. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response on February 3, 2015 maintaining
    that the Tribunal had made a finding that was open to it.

 5. The matter originally came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey  on
    May 1, 2015 when the case was adjourned with directions. On August  11,
    2015. Principal resident judge Dawson gave further directions as to the
    disposal of the matter and the matter was listed before me on the above
    date.

 6. The appellant's solicitors, on her instructions, informed the  Tribunal
    that she wished to withdraw her appeal as she intended to make a  fresh
    application in a different category.  The  solicitors  asked  that  the
    Tribunal treated the letter as  her  formal  request  to  withdraw  her
    appeal.

 7. Mr Harrison, on behalf of the respondent, did not oppose this request.

 8. Under Rule 17(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008
    as party may give notice of withdrawal either in writing or orally.  In
    light of the content of the letter dated October 9, 2015 I give consent
    under Rule 17(2) of the 2008 Rules.

 9. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make an order now.

    DECISION

10. There was no material error.  I uphold the original decision.
