                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

    By consent



       1. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  de  novo
          hearing pursuant to the consent order of the Court of Appeal made
          on 29 December 2014.

       2. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal is to be  conducted  by
          considering evidence which includes the SERCO assessment G2 to G8
          of the bundle before the Upper Tribunal.

       3. The appellant is permitted to adduce evidence in relation to  the
          classification of individuals processed by SERCO.

       4. For the  avoidance  of  doubt  the  remittal  to  the  First-tier
          Tribunal is on the basis that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
          Tribunal Judge Warren Grant contained a material  error  of  law,
          the reasons for which are not otherwise identified in  the  order
          of the Court of Appeal.
