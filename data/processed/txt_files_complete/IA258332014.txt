                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

 1. This is an appeal by Noman Aslam a citizen of Pakistan born 4th October
    1992.

 2. He appeals against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hussain issued on 23rd February 2015 dismissing his application for  an
    EEA residence card.  The Secretary of  State  refused  the  application
    because he was not satisfied that the Appellant's EEA family member was
    exercising Treaty Rights  in  the  UK  and  thus  a  family  member  as
    described in Regulation 6 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 3.  The Appellant applied to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  permission  to
    appeal against the decision of the Respondent and  on  24th  June  2015
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever refused permission.  He noted that  the
    grounds assert that the Judge had considered matters not raised by  the
    Respondent and  that  the  Respondent  should  have  been  flexible  in
    requesting further information but found that since the  Appellant  had
    requested that the appeal be dealt with on the  papers  the  Judge  was
    entitled to deal with the matter on the documents before him.  He found
    that the Judge had given clear reasons at paragraphs 2 to 3 and 7 to 14
    for not finding the Appellant to have established  that  his  wife  was
    exercising Treaty Rights in  the  UK.   He  found  that  there  was  no
    arguable error of law.  Permission  was  then  sought  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal and was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley.

 4. It is submitted in the grounds that the only finding of  fact  made  to
    support any refusal  is   that  the  Appellant  has  not  provided  any
    evidence to rebut the discrepancy in the phone number  and  address  of
    the Sponsor's employer. It is submitted that there was  a  plethora  of
    evidence, none of which had been scrutinised by the Judge.  There is no
    reference to the employer's letter dated 9th June 2014  which  confirms
    the authenticity of the  business  telephone  number  and  its  correct
    registered address nor to the fact that the payslips which were  issued
    East London Traders Ltd, a company which is registered  with  Companies
    House.  It is submitted that there was only a "bland"  reference  to  a
    letter from the director of the company confirming that he had  made  a
    statutory declaration that he had typed the incorrect phone number  and
    the incorrect address on the  headed  notepaper  used  for  the  letter
    confirming the employment.  It is also submitted that there is merit in
    the Article 8 grounds in this case and these were not dealt with.

 5. Judge Wikeley said:

         "2.  In the letter dated 9th June 2014 the Respondent gave a single
             reason  for  not  accepting  that  the  employment  could   be
             verified, relating to the unsuccessful attempt to make contact
             with the employer on the stated telephone number as  given  in
             the letter of 24th  April  2014.   The  Appellant  provided  a
             statutory declaration from the employer purporting to  explain
             the reason why the wrong number appeared on that letter.   The
             Judge noted this evidence at paragraph 9  but  it  is  unclear
             what weight was attached to that evidence and the  explanation
             it contained.

         3.   The Tribunal's  reasons  for  declining  to  accept  that  the
             Appellant's wife was employed and exercising Treaty Rights are
             set out at paragraphs 11 to 14.  It is arguable that these may
             disclose an error of law in part for the reasons given in  the
             Grounds of Appeal.  I make the following further observations.

         4.   First, the  Tribunal's  primary  reason  was  the  Appellant's
             failure to account for the discrepancy on the  wording  of  an
             employer's stamp that appeared on the papers at paragraphs  11
             and 12.  This raises two issues.  First, there is an issue  of
             fairness, as  this  was  not  the  reason  relied  on  by  the
             Respondent and had not apparently been put to the Appellant to
             provide an explanation.  A FTT is entitled to proceed  on  the
             papers but only if  due  process  is  observed.   Second,  the
             Judge's  transcription  of  the  stamp  at  paragraph  11   is
             incorrect as it inserts 'Luton'  where  that  place  does  not
             appear in the original.  This  error  may  have  affected  the
             significance attached to this evidence.

         5.   Second, the Tribunal was plainly exercised by  the  fact  that
             there was no evidence that  a  business  traded  from  No.  73
             Credon Road (see paragraphs 13 to 14);  rather,  any  official
             paperwork (e.g. from HMRC or Companies House) was addressed to
             No. 77 Credon Road.  However the main plank of the Appellant's
             argument against the case as put by the  Respondent  was  that
             No. 73 was a misprint and that No. 77 was the correct  address
             all along.  In this context,  the  failure  to  make  a  clear
             finding about the statutory declaration is problematic.

         6.   That is not to say that the Appellant's case was  in  any  way
             watertight - e.g. the alleged contract of employment  referred
             to the place of employment as being No. 73  and  not  No.  77.
             However there is sufficient here to justify giving  permission
             to appeal."

 6. The position of Mr Avery at the hearing before me was  that  the  Judge
    was entitled to make a decision based on the  documents  produced.   He
    relied on the documents produced and he  reached  findings  which  were
    open to him on the evidence before him.   He  said  there  are  clearly
    issues with the evidence.

 7. Mr Banavero submitted that the Judge should not have looked  at  things
    that were not raised by the Secretary of State because it  was  obvious
    that he could not get  any  answers  from  the  Appellant  about  these
    matters.  The Secretary of State had said that the phone number was the
    only issue.  Mr Banavero said that new issues were raised.   The  Judge
    ignored the PAYE information and the payslips.  The company  is  not  a
    dormant one.

Findings on error of law

 8. The Appellant requested that the appeal be heard on the papers.  A case
    dealt with in this way attracts a fee of �80 compared to  one  of  �140
    for an oral hearing. Apparently the Appellant said he could not  afford
    experienced Counsel to represent him at the hearing.  He  had  said  on
    the Notice of Appeal that he wanted to have an oral hearing  but  wrote
    to the Tribunal on 19th January 2014 asking that  it  be  done  on  the
    papers. It would have been open to the Judge to order an  oral  hearing
    if he thought one was necessary with no additional fee being charged in
    those circumstances.

 9. The Appellant had come to the UK originally as a Tier 4 Student Migrant
    and was granted leave to remain until 3rd May 2014.   It  is  the  case
    that the sole reason given  in  the  refusal  letter  is  that  when  a
    representative of the Home Office telephoned East London Traders Ltd on
    the number shown on the letter from them dated 24th April 2014 that the
    Appellant had provided with the  application  to  evidence  his  wife's
    employment, the person answering the call said that the number did  not
    relate to East London Traders Ltd and when a request was made to  speak
    to the person who had written the letter that name was not recognised.

10. The issue before  the  Judge  was  whether  the  Appellant's  wife  was
    exercising Treaty Rights in the United Kingdom.

11. In the Grounds of Appeal the Appellant said that  his  wife's  employer
    did not have a printed letterhead at the time  the  letter  dated  24th
    April 2014 was written and the letterhead was made up and the telephone
    number mistyped.  The Appellant  had  confirmed  this  in  a  Statutory
    Declaration.

12. The point made in the grounds about the Judge putting the word  "Luton"
    into his explanation of what was on the stamp is justified because  the
    word Luton does not appear on the stamp but the whole point is that the
    address given on the stamp is 7E Credun Road, Lunoon.  The postcode  is
    the same as that given by the Appellant as the  employer's  address  on
    the same page of the application form but  the  address  is  different.
    Companies House have the address  as  77  Credon  Road.   This  is  the
    address given by Mohammad Touhivul Islam in his  Statutory  Declaration
    dated 13th June 2014.  He says that the telephone  number  provided  on
    the letter dated 24th April  2013  was  incorrect  because  he  had  to
    compose a letterhead and typed the  wrong  phone  number  on  it.   The
    letter dated 24th April 2014 has the address of 73 Credon Road and  the
    telephone number bears no relation, apart from the prefix of  0208,  to
    the telephone number on the letter of 24th April.  Mr Islam also spells
    Credon with an "o" rather than a "u" as shown on the stamp, and I  have
    to say that the signature on the Statutory  Declaration  is  completely
    different to that on the letter.

13. Judge Hussain did rely on the discrepancy in the stamp.   He  said  the
    Appellant had not accounted for this.  He noted that  whilst  documents
    from Companies House state that the company East London Traders Ltd  is
    an "active" company, the last accounts were filed on 31st January  2013
    and there is a comment under "Recent  filing  history"-   "Accounts  of
    dormant company made up to 31/1/13".  The registered address  is  given
    as 77 Credon Road but the letterhead says 73 Credon Road.  There was no
    document addressed to the director at 73 Credon  Road.   There  was  no
    evidence that the business was trading either  in  May  2014  when  the
    Appellant's application was made or subsequently.

14. Basically the submission of Mr Banavero was that since  the  Judge  was
    raising points that had not been made by  the  Secretary  of  State  he
    should have arranged for an oral hearing to  take  place  so  that  the
    Appellant could be asked about these things.  The fact is however  that
    there were several discrepancies that were obvious to anyone looking at
    the evidence. They would have been obvious to  the  Appellant  and  his
    wife   had they checked  the  evidence  before  submitting  it  to  the
    Respondent.  Even leaving aside the issue of the stamp, one has to  ask
    how the Director of a business  would  put  down  the  wrong  telephone
    number and that so many variations of  the  address  were  given.   The
    records of Companies House indicated that the business was dormant. The
    Appellant chose not to have an oral hearing presumably  in  the  belief
    that the Statutory Declaration was all that was required to  rebut  the
    reason for refusal. It was the Sponsor's job  that  was  in  issue  and
    evidence from her could perhaps have resolved the doubts. The Appellant
    must have known that but chose not to offer oral  evidence.  I  do  not
    think there  was  any  obligation  on  the  Judge,  given  the  blatant
    discrepancies in the evidence before him to adjourn in  the  hope  that
    further evidence would be forthcoming.  The burden was on the Appellant
    to establish that on the balance of probabilities his wife was working.
    The fact is that even  leaving  aside  the  issue  of  the  stamp   the
    evidence that was produced to the Secretary  of  State  raised  serious
    concerns both about the viability of the business at the  time  of  the
    application and decision and of the address and telephone number  which
    the Judge found not to be explained by the Statutory Declaration.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  a  material  error
of law and shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
