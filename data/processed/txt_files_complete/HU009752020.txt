                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal G Clarke ('the Judge'), sent to the  parties  on  24  February
    2021, by which  the  appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse his entry clearance application was refused.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt granted the appellant permission to appeal on
    all grounds.

Remote Hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Microsoft Teams  hearing  held  during  the
    Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing room at Field House.  The
    hearing room and the building were open to the public. The hearing  and
    its start time were listed in the cause list. I was  addressed  by  the
    representatives in the same manner  as  if  we  were  together  in  the
    hearing room. I am satisfied: that this constituted a hearing  in  open
    court; that the open justice principle has been secured; that no  party
    has  been  prejudiced;  and  that,  insofar  as  there  has  been   any
    restriction on a right or interest, it is justified  as  necessary  and
    proportionate.

Anonymity

 4. No anonymity order was issued by the Judge.

 5. I observe that this appeal is concerned with an application  for  entry
    clearance. The sponsor, the appellant's father, is a recognised refugee
    residing in this  country.  By  means  of  his  witness  statement  the
    appellant identifies ongoing fears as to his  safety  in  Iraq  because
    people have threatened  him  whilst  they  continue  to  look  for  his
    sponsor. In the  circumstances,  I  find  that  the  common  law  right
    permitting the public to know about court proceedings in this matter, a
    right further protected by  article  10  ECHR,  is  outweighed  by  the
    appellant's rights under article 8 ECHR.

 6. I therefore grant the appellant anonymity and my order is  detailed  at
    the conclusion of this decision.

Background

 7. The appellant is a national of Iraq and is presently aged 31. He sought
    entry  clearance  under  the  Immigration  Rules  ('the  Rules')  as  a
    dependent of a refugee, but his application was  considered  under  the
    provision concerned with adult dependent relatives. An entry  clearance
    officer refused his application for  entry  clearance  on  19  December
    2019. An entry clearance manager maintained the  decision  on  7  April
    2020.

Hearing before the FtT

 8. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Hatton Cross on 9  February
    2021.

 9. The appellant conceded  that  he  could  not  satisfy  the  substantive
    requirements of the adult  dependent  route  under  the  Rules  but  he
    submitted that he could satisfy  paragraph  319V(i)(f)  of  the  Rules,
    namely that he is the son of a refugee living alone outside the  United
    Kingdom in the most exceptional compassionate circumstances.

10. The Judge concluded that the appellant could not meet the  requirements
    of paragraph 319V(i)(f) and (iii). Further, at ï¿½60 of the decision, the
    Judge found that no family  life  existed  between  the  appellant  and
    sponsor.

Grounds of Appeal

11. The grounds of appeal raise one ground of challenge,  namely  that  the
    Judge applied an unlawful test in the determination of  whether  family
    life exists between the appellant and his sponsor.

12. Paras. 13-14 of the grounds of appeal detail:

         '13. In the present appeal whilst it is acknowledged that the Judge
             correctly self-directed himself in relation  to  the  case  of
             [Singh v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2015]
             EWCA Civ 630], it is contended that:

               a) The Judge erred in law by focusing solely on the  question
                  as to whether the appellant was financially dependent upon
                  his UK sponsor and family, in concluding  that  article  8
                  ECHR was not engaged;

               b) The jurisprudence as summarised in [Rai v. Entry Clearance
                  Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320], makes clear  that
                  the test is the existence of real, committed or  effective
                  support.  Whilst  such  support  could  entail   financial
                  support,  it  is  plainly  not  a  requirement.  Emotional
                  support would, for example, potentially suffice.

               c) The Judge  failed  to  address  the  factors  set  out  at
                  paragraph 21 of the appellant's skeleton  argument,  which
                  were relied upon in support of  the  contention  that  the
                  ties of love and affection between the appellant  and  his
                  parents were more than the  normal  ties  that  one  would
                  expect between  adults  and  their  parents.  Those  were,
                  materially, that:

                   a) The appellant would be a  genuine  refugee,  were  he
                      outside his country of origin, and that his life  was
                      in danger in Iraq;

                   b) That the appellant's parents and all of his  siblings
                      (save for his USA-based  sister)  all  lived  in  the
                      United Kingdom; meaning  that  his  family  life  was
                      predominantly in the United Kingdom;

                   c) That the appellant's situation engaged the  principle
                      of protection for a refugee's  family  and  therefore
                      fell within the family reunion principle  of  Refugee
                      Convention.

         14.  It is recognised that decisions as to whether the relationship
             between adult family members engages article 8 ECHR are highly
             fact specific. It is contended, however, that:

               a) It remains incumbent upon a Judge  to  apply  the  correct
                  legal test;

               b) A Judge is, equally, required to ensure that all  relevant
                  factors  have  been  considered  in  reaching  that  fact-
                  specific determination.'

13. In granting permission to appeal UTJ Pitt reasoned, inter alia:

         '2.  It is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal took an  incorrect
             approach to the question of whether the appellant has a family
             life with his father and other relatives in  the  UK  for  the
             purposes of article 8 ECHR.'

Decision on Error of Law

14. The respondent filed and served a rule 24 response, dated 18 June 2021.
    It is authored by Mr. Bates, Senior Presenting Officer. The  respondent
    confirmed that she does not oppose the appellant's appeal at the  error
    of law stage and invited this Tribunal to determine  the  appeal  at  a
    resumed hearing.

15. The respondent observes at paras. 3 to 6:

         '3.  The crux of the challenge is the  FTTJ's  finding  (para.  60)
             that family life was not engaged, therefore the FTTJ failed to
             consider   the   further   Razgar   questions   and    general
             proportionality (para. 62).

         4.   The FTTJ recorded the SSHD's refusal in summary  (para.  7/8).
             This clearly indicates the SSHD's challenge  was  not  to  the
             existence   of   family   life   but   that   when   assessing
             proportionality  of  the  refusal  no   'unjustifiably   harsh
             consequences' were identified.

         5.   The FTTJ, therefore, appears to have gone behind a  concession
             of the SSHD  without  adequate  reasoning.  The  author  notes
             reference to the HOPO submissions (para. 33) that  Art  8  was
             not engaged but no  explanation  for  this  is  referenced  or
             considered by the FTTJ  as  to  whether  it  amounted  to  the
             withdrawal of the apparent concession made by the  ECO/ECM  on
             that point ...

         6.    Consequently,  the  SSHD  accepts  that  material  error   is
             disclosed either through procedural unfairness  or  inadequacy
             or reasoning as regards the finding of fact at para. 60.'

16. Before me Mr. Melvin did not seek to go behind the  rule  24  response,
    though he observed that he could not  read  such  concession  into  the
    respondent's decision.

17. On its face, the  respondent's  position  before  me  is  upon  initial
    consideration contradictory. However,  the  representatives  before  me
    agreed that the issue as  to  whether  a  concession  was  made  should
    properly have been addressed as a preliminary  matter.  Though  I  have
    much sympathy for the Judge, the  parties  having  not  addressed  this
    issue before him, the  existence  or  otherwise  of  a  concession  was
    properly to be considered as a preliminary issue and the failure to  do
    so is a material error of law.

18. The issue as to whether a concession was actually made was  not  argued
    before me and so I make no finding of fact on the issue. I observe that
    the decision letter may possibly be read as  being  contradictory.  The
    section entitled  'eligibility  relationship  requirement'  appears  to
    identify a lack of dependency in respect of family life  as  considered
    in Kugathas v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2003]  EWCA
    Civ 31, [2003] I.N.L.R. 170.  However,  when  considering  'exceptional
    circumstances and compassionate factors' the decision refers to  family
    life being 'maintained' by visitors, 'with no indication this could not
    continue for you' [Emphasis added]. I proceed no further on this matter
    as both representatives agreed before me  that  the  issue  as  to  the
    existence, or otherwise, of a concession can properly be addressed as a
    preliminary issue at the resumed hearing.

Resumed hearing

19. As to remaking the decision both Mr.  Lemer  and  Mr.  Melvin  were  in
    agreement that the matter should properly be remitted to the First-tier
    Tribunal. I have given careful  consideration  to  the  Joint  Practice
    Statement of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal concerning  the
    disposal of appeals in this Tribunal, and in particular to  para.  7.2,
    and conclude that the effect  of  the  identified  error  has  been  to
    deprive a party before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing.

20. I therefore conclude that it is just in all of the  circumstances  that
    this matter be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  decision  on
    all matters.

21. Mr. Lemer requested on behalf of the  appellant  that  this  matter  be
    transferred to Taylor House. Mr. Melvin did not object and so I  direct
    that this matter be heard by the First-tier Tribunal sitting at  Taylor
    House.



Notice of decision

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision  promulgated  on
    24 February 2021 pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of  the  Tribunal  Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007.

23. This matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  hearing
    before any judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal G Clarke.

24. This matter is transferred to the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor
    House.

25. No findings of fact are preserved.

26. An anonymity order is made.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise no  report  of  these
proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly or  indirectly
identify the appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  the
appellant and the respondent. Any failure  to  comply  with  this  direction
could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.
