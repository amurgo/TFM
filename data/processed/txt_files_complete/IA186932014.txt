For the Respondent:    Mr Saini, Counsel for MTG Solicitors, Middlesex


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary  of  State  however
    for convenience I shall now refer to the parties as  they  were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  10th  March  1981.   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated  3rd  April  2014
    refusing to grant him an EEA residence  card  as  confirmation  of  his
    retained right of residence following his divorce from his EEA national
    spouse.  His appeal was heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Napthine on 25th November 2014.   The  appeal  was  allowed  under  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 in a  determination  promulgated  on
    10th December 2014.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Fisher  on  2nd  February
    2015.  The grounds assert that the judge erred in law by  finding  that
    the Appellant could meet the  requirements  of  Regulation  10  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  His divorce was
    made absolute on 19th June 2014 and his  employment  did  not  commence
    until 6th October 2014, over three months  later.   The  grounds  state
    that on this basis the judge erred when he  found  that  the  Appellant
    could meet the requirements of Regulation 10(6).

The Hearing

 4. The Presenting Officer submitted that the matter in dispute is a narrow
    one. The Appellant failed to show that he came under  the  category  of
    employed, self- employed or self-sufficient when he was divorced.   The
    Appellant's claim before the judge was that when he was divorced he was
    self-sufficient but  the  judge  rejected  this.   I  was  referred  to
    paragraph 19 of the determination:

         "I do not accept that he was ever self-sufficient.  To  be  reliant
         upon another, even if he is one's  brother,  is  not  to  be  self-
         sufficient.  One is only self-sufficient if one  has  resources  of
         one's own which can be relied upon without the  favour  of  others.
         What would be the position if his brother fell out with him, or his
         brother took on his own family responsibilities, or fell upon  hard
         times?"

 5. The Presenting Officer submitted that because  the  Appellant  was  not
    self-sufficient he cannot meet the required criteria to satisfy the EEA
    Regulations.

 6.  The  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  at  paragraph  24  of   the
    determination the judge states that  the  Appellant  produced  evidence
    that he was employed by a company from  6th  October  2014  working  30
    hours a week for an annual salary of ï¿½10,140 and he produced wage slips
    confirming his  income.   The  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  he
    started this job more than three months after the date of his  divorce.
    She submitted therefore, that the Appellant does not fall into  any  of
    the required  categories  and  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Regulations.

 7. Counsel for the Appellant made  his  submissions  submitting  that  the
    ultimate issue is materiality and he submitted that the  error  by  the
    judge is not a material error.  He submitted that the Appellant  got  a
    job and started working on 6th October 2014.   He  submitted  that  the
    chronology has to be looked at.  The judge found that the Appellant had
    been a worker and so the sole issue  is  the  gap  between  the  decree
    absolute and the commencement of his new employment.  I was referred to
    the Appellant's witness statement at paragraph 7.  The Appellant states
    "I confirm that at the  time  of  the  application  I  had  been  self-
    sufficient for several  years  through  the  support  of  my  brother".
    Counsel submitted that the judge was therefore  mistaken  when  in  the
    determination he states that the Appellant was not self-sufficient.  He
    submitted that this is not a material error.

 8. Counsel submitted that the Appellant has sickness  insurance  and  this
    was accepted by the Respondent.  Counsel submitted that what we have to
    decide is whether the Appellant was self-sufficient for the gap between
    his decree absolute and the commencement of his new employment.

 9. At paragraph 19 the judge states that one is  only  self-sufficient  if
    one has resources of one's own and I was referred to the case of AG and
    others Germany [2007] UKAIT 00075.  At paragraph 59 it is stated "There
    is no justification for  any  suggestion  that  the  inclusion  in  the
    Citizens' Directive of an initial right of residence for  three  months
    represents a radical departure."  Counsel submitted that this Appellant
    had an initial right of residence for  three  months.   This  paragraph
    states that to meet the terms of the Regulations, nationals  of  Member
    States must have sufficient resources to avoid becoming a burden on the
    social assistance system of the host Member State during  their  period
    of residence.  Counsel submitted that  that  is  the  case  here.   The
    Appellant gets his resources from another  source.   Counsel  submitted
    that for the gap period from the date of the decree absolute until  the
    Appellant entered employment he was supported by  his  brother  and  he
    submitted that that is sufficient.

10. Counsel submitted that there is nothing in the Regulations stating that
    an applicant has  to  be  self-sufficient  using  his  own  money.   He
    submitted that this seems to be the personal view of the judge  but  it
    is not required in the Regulations.  He submitted that there is nothing
    to suggest that the Appellant was  ever  reliant  on  benefits  and  he
    submitted therefore, that if there is an error of law  in  the  judge's
    determination relating to this point, which is the only point in issue,
    it is not a material error.  He submitted that the judge was wrong when
    he found that the Appellant was  not  self-sufficient  during  the  gap
    period.

11. Counsel then submitted that there is no requirement for an applicant to
    be a worker from the day the decree absolute is granted.  He  submitted
    that he can be a jobseeker and that is the category the  Appellant  was
    in.  He submitted that this should have occurred to the judge.   I  was
    again referred to the Appellant's statement at paragraph 9 "I have also
    received a 'certificate of application' on 11th September 2014 from the
    Home Office which  I  required  in  order  to  engage  in  employment".
    Counsel submitted that it is crucial  for  a  jobseeker  to  have  this
    certificate of application and it is clear that  the  Home  Office  was
    aware that the Appellant was seeking work at this time.  I was referred
    to the letter from MTG Solicitors on behalf of the Appellant dated 29th
    January 2014 in which the Appellant's application for a residence  card
    was enclosed.  He submitted  that  the  application  was  made  at  the
    beginning of 2014 after the breakdown of the marriage  but  before  the
    decree absolute.  He submitted  that  in  spite  of  this  being  dated
    29th January 2014 the certificate was not sent to the Appellant  until
    September 2014 which is a gap of eight months.  He submitted  that  the
    Respondent should have considered the application within six months but
    did not do so.  He submitted that because of this the Respondent cannot
    say that the Appellant was not a worker as he could not have worked  at
    an earlier  date  than  the  one  he  did,  because  of  the  date  the
    certificate was sent to him.  He submitted that the  Respondent  should
    not criticise the  Appellant  on  this  basis  as  the  date  when  the
    Appellant was able to start work was due to the Respondent's  inaction,
    as the Appellant could not get  a  job  without  the  certificate.   He
    submitted that the Appellant was a jobseeker.  He  submitted  that  the
    Appellant made genuine attempts to get a job but was unable to register
    because he had  no  certificate,  so  although  he  was  not  a  formal
    jobseeker he was self-sufficient.  Counsel  submitted  that  there  are
    three ways in which the judge could have  looked  at  this,  the  first
    being that the Appellant was self-sufficient, the second based  on  the
    timing of the application and the third that he was a jobseeker.

12. Counsel submitted that the Appellant as  a  family  member  of  an  EEA
    citizen is entitled to a right of entry to the United Kingdom for three
    months.  He submitted  therefore  that  there  is  an  amnesty  in  the
    Appellant's case and for that  three  month  gap  period,  he  did  not
    require to do anything as long as he was  not  claiming  benefits.   He
    submitted that that  three  months  is  automatically  granted  to  the
    Appellant to enable him to get on his feet and he is then  entitled  to
    six months as a jobseeker.

13. Counsel asked me to uphold the judge's decision.

14. The Presenting Officer submitted that Rules are Rules and it  is  clear
    that Regulation 6 states that a qualified person has to be a jobseeker,
    a worker,  a  self-employed  person,  a  self-sufficient  person  or  a
    student.  She submitted that although the Appellant states that  he  is
    self-sufficient the refusal letter states on page 2:

         "The  documents  provided  to  demonstrate  your   self-sufficiency
         included bank statements in your name which show  regular  deposits
         into your account.  However these bank statements were  dated  from
         February 2013 to September 2013 which  means  you  have  failed  to
         prove your self-sufficiency since being separated from your  spouse
         in 2010."

    She submitted that the burden of proof is on the Appellant and what was
    provided was not sufficient to meet the terms of  the  Regulations.   I
    was again referred to the case of AG and others at paragraph 62.   This
    states that an Appellant must substantiate his claim and she  submitted
    that the Appellant in this case has not done so.  If the  Appellant  is
    now saying that he is a jobseeker it is up to him to prove this and she
    submitted that he has not done so.  She submitted that at paragraph  62
    of AG and others it is stated that at the  date  of  the  decision  the
    Secretary of State had no evidence that he was either a jobseeker or  a
    worker or any other sub-category of "qualified persons".  She submitted
    that that is the case here and in this case the judge was not  entitled
    to allow the appeal.  She submitted that there is a material  error  of
    law in the determination.

Determination

15. This Appellant had a residence card in the United  Kingdom  until  23rd
    May 2017 but this was revoked because he and his wife separated in 2010
    and got divorced in June 2014.  The decree absolute is dated 19th  June
    2014.  The Appellant's argument has been set out clearly by Counsel  at
    this hearing.  He states that the Appellant could not apply for  a  job
    until he got a certificate of application  which  he  did  not  receive
    until 11th September 2014.  He got a job  shortly  after  that  on  6th
    October 2014.  The problem is the gap between 19th June  2014  and  the
    job start up date of 6th October 2014.

16. The evidence before the judge, according to the Appellant, was that  he
    was self-sufficient during that gap period.  The judge found that  that
    was not the case.

17. The requirements of Regulation 10(6) are that the  Appellant  needs  to
    provide evidence that since the date of  his  divorce  he  has  been  a
    worker, a self-employed person or a self-sufficient person as if he was
    an EEA national.  I find that the judge was  right  to  find  that  the
    Appellant was not a self-sufficient person.  At the First-tier  hearing
    the Appellant's representative submitted that the Appellant would  need
    to show that he qualified in his own right  from  the  date  he  became
    independent.  The judge accepts that at no time has he been reliant  on
    state support for accommodation or maintenance.  Although  being  self-
    sufficient in terms of the Regulations does not specifically state that
    a  person  has  to  be  self-sufficient  on  his  own  resources,   the
    Regulations make it clear what is required.  The judge finds that self-
    sufficient is to have savings and investments, property and  income  of
    one's own on  which  one  can  rely.   That  does  not  apply  to  this
    Appellant.  The judge has given adequate reasons for  his  findings  on
    self-sufficiency.

18. The Appellant's representative now states  that  the  Appellant  was  a
    jobseeker.  Counsel admitted that he  was  not  formally  a  jobseeker.
    This was not raised before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   The  burden
    of proof is on the Appellant.  I do not find that he has shown  himself
    to be a jobseeker for the three month period in question.  He  was  not
    registered as a jobseeker with the relevant employment office.

19. The Appellant was not a worker for that period so during that period he
    was not a worker, was not self-employed, was not  self-sufficient,  was
    not a jobseeker and was not a student.

20. The Appellant did not get his certificate  of  application  until  11th
    September 2014.  I accept that this was unfortunate but we  still  have
    the gap between the date of the decree absolute on 19th June  2014  and
    the date of  commencement  of  his  employment  on  6th  October  2014.
    Counsel has referred to a three month period  of  amnesty  but  in  the
    Appellant's circumstances the period between the divorce and the job is
    three weeks more than  three  month,  even  if  I  accept  this  as  an
    argument.

21. The terms of the Regulations are clear.  The Appellant  does  not  meet
    the definition of "qualified person" from 19 June 2014 until 6  October
    2014.

22. Because the Appellant's divorce was not made absolute until  19th  June
    2014 and because he did not commence work until 6th  October  2014  the
    Appellant can not meet the requirements of Regulation 10(6).

23. There is a material error of law in the judge's determination.

24. I am setting  aside  the  determination  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Napthine promulgated on 10th December 2014.
