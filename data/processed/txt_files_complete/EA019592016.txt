                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 12th of October 1987.  He
    appeals against a decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Paul
    sitting at Taylor house on 1st of June 2017 in which the Judge dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent  dated  28th
    of January 2016. That decision was to refuse to grant  the  Appellant  a
    permanent residence card as a confirmation of a right to reside  in  the
    United Kingdom following the Appellant's divorce from an  EEA  national,
    Ms Kinga Czajkowska, ("the Sponsor"). The Appellant  originally  arrived
    in the United Kingdom in 2006 on a student visa which  was  subsequently
    extended until 30th of September 2011. He then applied for a certificate
    of approval to marry the Sponsor on 16th of  March  2009,  the  marriage
    taking place on 6th of  May  2009.  The  Appellant  was  issued  with  a
    residence card dated 3rd of November 2011 valid until  22nd  of  October
    2015. There were two children of the marriage. The marriage subsequently
    broke down and the Willesden Family Court pronounced a  decree  absolute
    of divorce on 13th of May 2015.

The Appellant's Case

 2. The Appellant argued that the Sponsor had been exercising treaty  rights
    because she had been self-employed  since  November  2014  as  a  beauty
    therapist. She had commenced employment with a company  called  Everyday
    Snacks Ltd from 1st of February 2013 until 31st  of  December  2013  and
    recommenced her employment with them in June 2014 lasting until 19th  of
    May 2015. The Appellant produced 2 payslips from that company dated 31st
    of August 2014 and another dated 30th of  September  2014.  This  showed
    that the Sponsor was paid in cash but there was no other  evidence  that
    wages had been paid. Further no tax or national insurance  was  paid.  A
    P45 stated that  the  Sponsor  had  left  this  employment  on  30th  of
    September 2014 (as opposed to 19th of May 2015 as claimed).


 3. HMRC national insurance contribution letters dated 14th of November 2014
    and 28th of March 2015 were provided as was a unique taxpayer  reference
    number for the Sponsor. The Appellant argued that the Sponsor was  being
    uncooperative regarding his application but the Respondent noted in  the
    refusal letter that the Appellant had been able to provide the Sponsor's
    full bank statements from 2009 to 2014, her HMRC employment record in  a
    letter dated 7th of July 2014, payslips and P 45's. She had also written
    a letter of support in which  she  had  said  "things  never  got  sour"
    between the couple after they separated and that she did  not  want  her
    children "to grow up without the presence of their father".


 4. The Respondent decided that  the  Appellant  could  not  bring  himself
    within the requirements of Regulation 15(1)(f) of the 2006  regulations
    and had not retained a permanent right of residence following  divorce.
    Regulation 15(1)(f) provides that a permanent right to reside  will  be
    acquired where  the  applicant  has  resided  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations for at least five years and was at the end of that period a
    family member who had retained the right of  residence.  The  Appellant
    could not show that he was residing in accordance with the  Regulations
    at the point of divorce because he could not show that the Sponsor  was
    exercising treaty rights.

The Decision at First Instance

 5. At the hearing at first instance the Appellant applied to the Judge  for
    an adjournment in order to obtain an "Amos" direction directing the Home
    Office  to  investigate  the  material  that  had  just  been   provided
    concerning the Sponsor's employment. This  investigation  the  Appellant
    argued would show that the Sponsor was working at the relevant time. The
    further documentation  was  described  by  the  Judge,  at  [6]  of  the
    determination as a calculation result for the years 2015  and  2016  for
    the Sponsor and an income tax return for the Sponsor.  The  Respondent's
    decision was made on 28th of January 2016 but these further documents to
    support the Appellant's case were  only  provided  the  day  before  the
    hearing on 31st of May 2017.


 6. When pressed as to why this was so the Appellant's  representative  said
    he had instructions  that  the  Sponsor  had  been  uncooperative  until
    relatively recently when further documents were provided.  By  contrast,
    the Appellant's statement in his bundle maintained that the Sponsor  had
    been uncooperative (with no indication of any assistance she had given).
    The Judge held at [8] that there was no sensible explanation within  the
    witness statement as to how the further documents were obtained  or  how
    obtaining any further documents could be consistent with  the  Sponsor's
    so-called lack of co-operation.


 7. The Judge rejected the request for an adjournment at [9] as there was no
    reason to believe that the Respondent would consider  herself  bound  to
    make any of the enquiries sought by the  Appellant.  Further  there  had
    been a period of 18 months for the Appellant to get his  case  in  order
    and the submission of these materials at  the  door  of  the  court  was
    unsatisfactory. The Judge had doubts as  to  the  further  documentation
    provided by the Appellant not least because the Sponsor was referred  to
    as Mr instead of Miss in an HMRC  document.  If  the  Sponsor  had  been
    filling in the forms herself she would not have described herself  as  a
    male.


 8. There were discrepancies between the calculation results which  appeared
    to show that the pay from all employments for the year 2015/16 was �3608
    with a net profit of �902 whereas the actual tax return for  the  period
    showed that the turnover amounted to no more  than  �1182.  Very  little
    reliance could be placed on the documents.  They  did  not  include  any
    evidence of any payments in to the Sponsor's account in respect  of  any
    work done by her. The Appellant argued that the statements provided were
    a personal account not the Sponsor's  business  account  but  the  Judge
    found it strange that only the personal accounts had been produced.  The
    Respondent's decision was not wrong and the Judge dismissed the  appeal.
    In doing so he made it clear he was not making  a  final  ruling  as  to
    whether or not the Sponsor was indeed exercising treaty  rights  at  the
    point of divorce simply concluding that on the evidence before him  that
    had not been demonstrated to the requisite standard.

The Onward Appeal

 9. The Appellant appealed against this decision arguing that the Respondent
    had a duty under section 40 of the UK Borders  Act  2007  to  carry  out
    checks on whether an EU Sponsor was exercising her treaty  rights  where
    the couple were divorcing. I pause to note here that in fact section  40
    states  that  HMRC  and  the  Respondent  may  supply  each  other  with
    information for the purposes of immigration control and  other  purposes
    mentioned in the section. The section does not impose an  obligation  on
    the Respondent and the  grounds  were  misconceived.  The  grounds  also
    argued that the Judge had made no proper findings on whether the Sponsor
    was  exercising  her  treaty  rights  at  the  point  of  divorce.  They
    reiterated  that  the  Sponsor  was  unwilling  to  cooperate  with  the
    Appellant.


10. The application for permission to  appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Osborne on 29th  of  January  2018.  In
    granting permission to appeal he wrote that it  was  arguable  that  the
    Judge should have adjourned the appeal hearing  and  directed  that  the
    Respondent should provide work/income tax records  for  the  Sponsor  to
    establish whether she was exercising treaty rights at the material time.
    All of the issues raised in the grounds were arguable.

The Hearing Before Me

11. As a result of the grant of permission the  matter  came  before  me  to
    determine in the 1st place whether there was a material error of law  in
    the determination of the First-tier Tribunal such that it fell to be set
    aside. If there was not then the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    would stand.


12. For the Appellant counsel submitted that the issue in  the  case  was  a
    narrow one, whether the Sponsor was exercising treaty rights at the time
    of the divorce. The Judge had  left  open  the  issue  at  [14]  of  the
    determination where he had written that he was not making a final ruling
    as to whether or not the Sponsor was exercising  treaty  rights  at  the
    point of divorce. The main complaint the Appellant made in this case was
    that it was perverse and irrational not to adjourn  the  hearing  for  a
    direction to be made in accordance with Amos [2011] EWCA  Civ  552.  The
    Appellant accepted that Amos was not authority for the proposition  that
    the Respondent was compelled to make  enquiries  of  the  HMRC  but  the
    reason the Judge gave at [9] for refusing the adjournment was wrong.  It
    was not a late issue being  raised  that  the  Sponsor  was  failing  to
    cooperate with the Appellant about her working history. The relationship
    post-divorce had fluctuated for example there were now difficult  issues
    between the parties involving contact to the two children of the family.




13. The Appellant had made it clear in his application form at section  2.13
    that he was unable to provide the Sponsor's passport because  she  would
    not cooperate. The Respondent had  the  option  at  that  stage  not  to
    proceed further with the application. The fact that the  Respondent  did
    proceed to consider it meant that the Respondent was accepting that  the
    Appellant could not provide the Sponsor's passport but that would not be
    held against the Appellant. The Sponsor had provided a letter of support
    (see paragraph 3 above) but that had not indicated she  was  willing  to
    give documents it just said she was willing to permit contact.


14. The purpose of an Amos direction was not for the Respondent to make  the
    Appellant's case  for  him  but  the  Appellant  had  provided  whatever
    evidence he could. It was obvious the Sponsor  would  not  come  to  the
    hearing. Counsel was unable to say when the further documents that  were
    supplied at the hearing came into the possession of the Appellant  other
    than to say it was close to the hearing. Leaving the  matter  open  (and
    not making a final decision on) whether  the  Sponsor  was  or  was  not
    working at the  date  of  divorce  was  generous  of  the  Judge  but  a
    successful application by the Appellant would only succeed if help  came
    from HMRC. The pragmatic step was for the application to succeed and  an
    Amos direction would have to be made.


15. In response the Presenting Officer argued that the  Judge  was  entirely
    right not to grant an adjournment. The Respondent was not bound to  make
    enquiries of HMRC. The Judge's finding at [9], that  the  Appellant  had
    had a period of 18 months to get his case in order but had not done  so,
    was open to the Judge who had left the matter  open  for  the  Appellant
    were the latter to be able to produce further documents. The grounds  of
    appeal were merely a disagreement with the result. The  decision  should
    stand.


16. In conclusion counsel argued that there was more  than  a  disagreement,
    there were no findings as to whether the Sponsor was  exercising  treaty
    rights, the matter was left in a vacuum. The final paragraph of Amos was
    narrower than the Respondent was suggesting (see below). Submissions had
    been made in Amos that it was  open  to  an  Appellant  to  have  sought
    directions, the problem was that the Appellant in that case had not done
    that.


17. I note here that at paragraph 40 of Amos  that  the  appeal  of  another
    Appellant, Ms Theophilus was criticised thus: "[She] could have  applied
    under regulation 50 for a witness summons requiring  her  ex-husband  to
    attend and give evidence as to whether  or  not  he  was  and  had  been
    working. She did not do so. Nor did she seek a direction under  rule  45
    requiring the Secretary of State to provide  any  information  necessary
    for the determination of  her  appeal.  Indeed,  she  made  no  relevant
    application to the Tribunal."


18. An earlier decision of Kerr [2004] UKHL 23 cited  in  Amos,  held  that:
    "The department is the one which knows what questions it  needs  to  ask
    and what information it needs to have in order to determine whether  the
    conditions of entitlement have been met. The claimant  is  the  one  who
    generally speaking can and must supply that information. But  where  the
    information is available to the department  rather  than  the  claimant,
    then the department must take the necessary steps to  enable  it  to  be
    traced." The Court of Appeal in Amos  made  clear  that  Kerr  "was  not
    authority for the proposition that the Home Secretary is bound  to  make
    enquiries of other government departments for evidence they may  or  may
    not have concerning issues before the Tribunal".

Findings

19. The difficulty for the Appellant in this case was that he did  not  have
    sufficient evidence to show that as at May 2015 when the decree absolute
    was pronounced his former wife was exercising treaty rights by  working.
    There was some evidence before the  Judge  which  he  rejected  for  the
    reasons he gave which I have summarised above, see paragraphs 7  and  8.
    What the Appellant wanted in this case  was  a  further  opportunity  to
    obtain more information by adjourning the hearing at  1st  instance  and
    obtaining a direction from the Tribunal that the Respondent  should  use
    her best endeavours to obtain documentation of the Sponsor's employment.
    The Judge was not prepared to make such a direction or adjourn the  case
    for that to be done.


20. The test of whether to  adjourn  is  one  of  fairness,  see  the  Upper
    Tribunal authority of Nwaigwe [2014] UKUT 418. The  Appellant  had  been
    able to obtain some documents but could not explain how those  documents
    had been obtained against  the  background  of  an  alleged  failure  to
    cooperate by the Sponsor, who seemed far from uncooperative according to
    her letter of support. No explanation was given to  the  Judge  why  the
    further papers that  were  produced,  which  had  not  been  before  the
    Respondent at the time of the decision, had not been  disclosed  earlier
    than the day before the hearing. I queried that with counsel and  I  too
    was not told when the Appellant had come into possession of the  further
    documents that is the calculation results and income tax returns.


21. This was an important point in the determination because it was part  of
    the reasons why the Judge was not prepared to adjourn  the  hearing.  At
    the very least it could be expected that the Appellant would be able  to
    deal with that point but no such explanation was forthcoming.  In  those
    circumstances it is difficult to criticise the Judge for being reluctant
    to adjourn the hearing on a purely speculative  exercise  with  no  real
    prospects that an adjournment would  secure  the  result  the  Appellant
    requested.


22. The Respondent  could  not  be  compelled  to  make  enquiries  but  the
    Appellant also had to play his part in the process as the House of Lords
    put it in Kerr.  A reason for refusing the adjournment was the issue  of
    the delay in lodging the extra documents the Appellant had and the  lack
    of explanation how he was able to obtain those.  For  the  Appellant  to
    demonstrate that it was unfair to refuse the adjournment he needed to be
    able to deal with those points but they were not dealt with in front  of
    the First-tier Tribunal and  I  was  not  able  to  obtain  any  further
    explanation either. The Judge was entitled to proceed as he did  on  the
    basis of what he had in front of him. What he had was not enough to show
    that the Sponsor was exercising treaty rights at the relevant time.


23. I do not accept the argument that because the Appellant had put  in  his
    application form that he could not obtain the  Sponsor's  passport  that
    the Respondent necessarily accepted that position  and  would  not  hold
    against the Appellant that he was not producing  sufficient  documentary
    evidence of the Sponsor's employment. If the Respondent had rejected the
    application at that stage because of a failure to produce  the  Sponsors
    passport, it would drive a  coach  and  horses  through  the  provisions
    relating  to  retained  rights  of  residents  following  divorce.   The
    Appellant had to be given his chance to show what he had in relation  to
    the Sponsor's employment.


24. The issue was why if  the  Appellant  could  not  produce  the  Sponsors
    passport he was able to produce tax returns, bank statements  and  other
    documents. That was what the Appellant needed  to  explain  clearly  and
    that was what he failed to do. An Amos direction would  not  have  dealt
    with the  problem  that  the  Sponsor's  personal  bank  statements  the
    Appellant produced did not assist him. The Appellant had  the  Sponsor's
    address but no request for a witness summons  was  ever  made.  Yet  the
    Appellant was prepared to take the  Sponsor  to  court  in  relation  to
    contact matters.


25. In any event there were difficulties with  the  documents  such  as  the
    description of the Sponsor as male. The important point was that  before
    the Tribunal gave a case  management  direction  to  the  Respondent  to
    obtain documents relating to the Sponsor, some good reason needed to  be
    shown why the Respondent should do this and that the Appellant had  done
    all he could. The evidence for a lack of co-operation by the Sponsor was
    distinctly lacking. The Appellant  was  unable  to  show  that  fairness
    required an adjournment.


26. The Judge did leave one matter open in the sense that if  the  Appellant
    could produce further and better documents  which  tended  to  show  the
    Sponsor was working at the relevant time, the Appellant would be able to
    make a fresh application under the  2016  Regulations  for  a  permanent
    residence card. Had the Judge decided finally that the Sponsor  was  not
    working at the relevant time that might have created severe difficulties
    for the Appellant in the future. The burden  of  proof  of  establishing
    that the Sponsor was exercising  treaty  rights  at  the  relevant  time
    rested on the Appellant. If the Appellant could not prove  that  it  was
    more likely than not that the Sponsor was working his application  would
    fail. It was not for the Judge to go on to make a definite finding  that
    Sponsor was not working unless the  evidence  clearly  pointed  in  that
    direction. The problem for the Appellant was that the evidence  did  not
    point clearly in any direction and since the burden was on him he  could
    not show he was entitled to the grant of a permanent residence card.


27. Although there was  reference  in  submissions  and  on  the  papers  to
    outstanding issues between the Appellant and the Sponsor relating to the
    children of the marriage, this was not a  case  where  Article  8  arose
    because it was a purely EEA case with no removal directions  or  section
    120 notice. I do not consider there was any material error of law in the
    Judge's decision to refuse the adjournment and proceed to deal with  the
    matter. The Appellant's remedy is to make fresh  application  if  he  is
    able to with further documentation. It is not for the Respondent to make
    the Appellant's case for him particularly where, as the Judge found, the
    Appellant has not done all that could reasonably be expected of  him.  I
    therefore dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
    error of law and I uphold  the  decision  to  dismiss  the  Appellant's
    appeal

Appellant's appeal dismissed

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
