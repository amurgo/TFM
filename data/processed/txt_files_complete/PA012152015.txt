For the appellant:     Mr K Behbahani, instructed by Behbahani & Co
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, MR, date of birth 31.3.81, is a citizen of Iran.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Shand promulgated 4.4.16, dismissing on all grounds his appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 28.8.15,  to  refuse  his
    asylum, humanitarian protection,  and  human  rights  grounds,  and  to
    remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 5.1.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ransley  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.6.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 25.8.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found such  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Shand to be set aside and the decision in the  appeal
    remade by allowing the appeal.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Ransley found it arguable that:

      a)  in assessing the risk on return as a Christian convert  the  judge
         failed to properly  consider  and  apply  the  relevant  case  law,
         including HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon);

      b) the judge  failed  to  properly  consider  the  background  country
         materials provided  by  the  appellant  and  the  respondent,  both
         highlighting similar risk factors;

      c) the judge erred in law by failing to make a clear finding as to who
         was telling the truth, the appellant or his brother;

      d) the judge erred in applying a degree of assumption in reaching  the
         adverse credibility findings set out in �31 to �35.

 7. At �39 of the decision the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  found  that  the
    appellant is a Christian convert from Islam and that on return to  Iran
    he would seek to attend church and associate with Christians. The judge
    also found that his  conversion  is  likely  to  become  known  to  the
    authorities, as well as friends, family and colleagues.

 8. Although doubts were expressed at �20 and elsewhere  in  the  decision,
    ultimately, the judge was prepared to give the appellant the benefit of
    the doubt at �49 and accepted the appellant's factual claim of  adverse
    encounters with  the  authorities  on  account  of  his  conversion  to
    Christianity in Iran.

 9. However, the judge found that he  would  not  be  at  risk  on  return,
    because he would not be an evangeliser and would be  no  more  than  an
    ordinary convert. The judge considered that the Tribunal was  bound  by
    the country guidance case law of SZ & JM (Christians  -  FS  confirmed)
    Iran CG [2008] UKAIT 00082, notwithstanding the  Secretary  of  State's
    own more recent policy guidance  on  'Iran:  Christians  and  Christian
    Converts,' addressed at �47 of  the  decision,  which  quotes  that  as
    Sharia law does not recognise the right of Muslims to change  religion,
    the  conversion  of  Muslims  to  Christianity  is  illegal  in   Iran.
    "Christians  who  have  converted  from  Islam  are  at  real  risk  of
    persecution in Iran and a grant of asylum is likely to be appropriate."
    Judge Shand did not find this and other background information  to  the
    same effect to be sufficiently cogent  evidence  to  justify  departing
    from the country guidance of SJ & JM.

10. I accept Mr Behbahani's submission  that  even  on  the  basis  of  the
    primary finding that the appellant is a Muslim convert to Christianity,
    he has a well-founded fear of persecution.  It appears that  the  judge
    was misdirected in conflating the issue of evangelism with whether  the
    appellant would exercise discretion in following his Christian faith in
    Iran, and failed to recognise that following HJ (Iran),  the  appellant
    cannot be expected to conceal his faith  (which  conversion  the  judge
    accepted the authorities are already aware of). If  he  would  only  be
    discrete about exercising his faith because of the fear of persecution,
    he is at risk on return and entitled to asylum. The judge's reliance on
    SZ & JM fails to take account the ratio of HJ (Iran). In any event,  as
    his conversion is already  known  to  the  authorities,  as  the  judge
    accepted, there is no real question of the exercise of discretion.

11. Mr Walker accepted that the judge had not properly assessed the risk on
    return and had not applied HJ (Iran), and thus that the decision  could
    not stand.

12. There are other  flaws  in  the  decision.  For  example,  at  �34  and
    elsewhere, the judge compared and contrasted the  appellant's  evidence
    of events in Iran with  that  of  his  brother,  pointing  out  alleged
    discrepancies between the two as to whether  they  were  in  the  house
    together and left before the police arrived. However, the judge  failed
    to indicate whether he accepted the brother's evidence as accurate  and
    if so, why he preferred his evidence to that of the appellant. That the
    appellant allegedly differed from the account of his brother  does  not
    mean that the appellant is not telling the truth. In the circumstances,
    the judge made flawed credibility  findings  based  on  these  supposed
    discrepancies. Further and in any event, on examining  the  evidence  I
    find that there is in fact no real discrepancy between their  accounts.



13. It follows that  on  the  judge's  own  findings  of  fact  as  to  the
    appellant's conversion, the appeal should have been allowed  on  asylum
    grounds.

Conclusions:

14. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the  appeal  by  allowing  the
                    appeal on asylum grounds. In the  circumstances,  it  is
                    not necessary  to  decide  the  appeal  on  humanitarian
                    protection or human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  continue
that anonymity order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
