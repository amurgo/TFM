Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Sills of Counsel, instructed by J D Spicer Zeb
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant claims to be a citizen of Eritrea whereas the respondent
believes her to be an Ethiopian citizen.  She was born on 29th October 1997
and arrived in the United Kingdom on 20th December 2017, when she claimed
asylum.

2.   The respondent refused her application on 1st July 2018 and she
appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against that refusal.  The appeal was
heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge M Davies at Manchester Piccadilly on
21st August, 2018.

3.   This morning Mr McVeety and Mr Sills have agreed between them that the
determination of First Tier Tribunal Judge M Davies contain material errors
of law and have invited me to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
for hearing afresh by a judge other than Judge M Davies.  I am grateful to
them.

4.   I find that the determination of Judge M Davies does contain material
errors of law and I set it aside.  The appeal will be heard afresh by the
First-tier Tribunal before a judge other than Judge M Davies.

Notice of Decision

The determination is set aside

No anonymity direction is made.
