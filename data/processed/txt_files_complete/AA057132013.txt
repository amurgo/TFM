                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

   1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party  invited
      me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria who was born on  16  July  1981.
      It would appear that the appellant entered  the  UK  illegally  on  or
      around 11 May 2010 as he was  arrested  on  that  day  by  the  police
      leaving a lorry near the M25.  He produced a  false  ID.   He  claimed
      asylum but his application was treated as withdrawn on 5 November 2010
      as he had absconded from his allotted accommodation and had failed  to
      advise the UKBA of his  whereabouts.   On  12  November  2010  he  was
      arrested on suspicion of theft, namely shoplifting.  He then  provided
      a different but false ID and, as a  result  of  fingerprints,  he  was
      linked to the previous false ID that he had provided.   He  failed  to
      report regularly to the UKBA and was again registered as an absconder.
       On 12 March 2013, he was  arrested  by  immigration  officers  whilst
      attending the wedding of his brother at the Cardiff  Register  Office.
      During that arrest, he provided ID in his current  name  which  it  is
      accepted is his true identity.  On 3 May  2013,  the  appellant  again
      claimed asylum.  On 30 May 2013, the Secretary of  State  refused  the
      appellant's claim for asylum and also his claim under the  Immigration
      Rules and under Article 8 for leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis
      of his marriage to a British citizen  which  had  taken  place  on  12
      February 2013.   I will refer to his wife as LB.  She is 21  years  of
      age and, as a  result  of  her  relationship  with  the  appellant  is
      pregnant and their baby is due on 20 January 2014.

   3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In a  determination
      promulgated on 24 July 2013, Judge B Lloyd dismissed  the  appellant's
      appeal on asylum grounds.  He made an adverse credibility finding  and
      did not accept that the appellant  would  be  at  risk  on  return  to
      Algeria.  In addition, he found that the appellant did  not  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules and that he had not  established
      a breach of Article 8 on the basis of his private life and his  family
      life with his wife.

   4. The appellant sought permission to appeal against the Judge's decision
      in respect of Article 8.  The appellant did not challenge the  Judge's
      dismissal of the appeal on asylum grounds.  On  22  August  2013,  the
      First-tier Tribunal (Judge Brunnen) granted the  appellant  permission
      to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the basis that:

           "It is arguable that the Judge did not make adequate findings as
           to whether it would be reasonable to expect the appellant's wife
           to accompany him on removal and did not  give  adequate  reasons
           for finding that the decision was proportionate".

   5. Thus, the appeal came before me.  The appellant was  unrepresented  at
      the hearing and when the hearing initially commenced it  became  clear
      that the appellant required an interpreter which had not  been  booked
      by the Tribunal.  Having made enquiries, the hearing was adjourned for
      around two hours until an interpreter could attend.  The hearing  then
      continued with the appellant having the benefit of an interpreter.

   6. The appellant relies essentially on the fact the Judge Lloyd had found
      that the appellant's wife could accompany him to Algeria and,  in  the
      appellant's view, that is impossible.  She would not be able  to  find
      work and neither would he.  The appellant also pointed  out  that  his
      wife's salary was about �800 monthly after tax and deductions and that
      he and his wife could not meet the requirement in the Rules of �18,000
      annual income.   He told me that he did not feel that he  could  leave
      her here given her circumstances.

   7. Mr Richards submitted that the Judge had  taken  account  of  all  the
      relevant evidence and he was clearly aware that the  appellant's  wife
      was  pregnant.   He  submitted  that  the  Judge  had  considered  the
      possibility of the appellant's wife  travelling  to  Algeria  and  the
      processing times in Algeria for visa applications  and  had  concluded
      that the appellant's removal was proportionate.  Whilst the  appellant
      might disagree with that finding, the Judge had not erred  in  law  in
      reaching it.

   8. As I have already indicated, the Judge Lloyd first concluded that  the
      appellant could not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.
      It is not entirely clear upon what basis he came to  that  view.   The
      respondent, in her refusal letter, had done so on the basis  that  she
      did not accept that the appellant's relationship with his wife  was  a
      "genuine and subsisting relationship" for the purposes of EX.1.   That
      cannot have been the basis for the Judge's finding as he accepted that
      the appellant and his wife had "family life in  the  UK"  and  such  a
      finding would be wholly inconsistent with  the  Secretary  of  State's
      view that their relationship was not "genuine  and  subsisting".   The
      Judge's  reasoning  is  brief  and  is  found  at  para  43   of   his
      determination as follows:

           "43.  Taking into account the totality of the evidence  relating
                 to his family circumstances in the UK I  conclude  that  he
                 does not satisfy the Immigration Rules under the new regime
                 constructed by HC194 and Appendix FM."

   9. It maybe that the Judge had in  mind  the  financial  requirements  of
      Appendix FM but, if that is the case, no where  in  his  determination
      does he set out any of the  evidence  concerning  the  income  of  the
      appellant's  wife.   Alternatively,  perhaps  he  concluded  that  the
      requirements in EX.1 were not satisfied because it had not been  shown
      that:

           "There are insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with  [the
           appellant's wife] continuing outside the UK."

  10. However, the Judge does not appear to have made any finding in respect
      of the appellant and  his  wife  carrying  on  their  family  life  in
      Algeria.  In relation to Article 8, the Judge said this at  paras  48-
      50:

           "48.  I have listened with great care to the evidence  which  Ms
                 Robins has given about her strong disinclination to  travel
                 to Algeria with her husband if he is  required  to  return.
                 Her reluctance extends  to  a  temporary  as  well  as  any
                 permanent return.

             49. The Appellant may of course upon return to Algeria  make  a
                 prompt application for re-entry to the UK on the  basis  of
                 his marriage to Ms Robins.  Mr  Hammonds  argues  that  the
                 processing  times  are  not  necessarily  excessive.    The
                 Presenting Officer refers also to the foreign travel advice
                 relating  to   Algeria   (http://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-
                 advice).  The FCO advise against all but  essential  travel
                 specifically to the following administrative districts east
                 of Algiers: Poumerd�s  Bouira  and  Tizi  Ouzou.   This  is
                 because of a threat from terrorism.  However the  Appellant
                 has stated in his own evidence that his parents  have  been
                 mobile to avoid  any  trouble.   He  could,  if  absolutely
                 necessary, adopt the same policy for himself and his family
                 upon return to his home country.

             50. Having regard to the  totality  of  the  evidence  and  the
                 relevant law (and with regard to the guiding principles  of
                 the judgment in FM) I find that a decision  to  remove  the
                 Appellant to Algeria is a  proportionate  one  in  all  the
                 circumstances having regard  to  the  qualified  rights  of
                 Article 8.

  11. In fact, the Judge said this is the context of Article  8.   But,  the
      evidence of the appellant's wife was that  she  could  not  travel  to
      Algeria temporarily or permanently.  The Judge approached Article 8 on
      the basis that the appellant could be expected to return to Algeria to
      obtain entry clearance.  There  is  no  finding  here  concerning  the
      reasonableness of the appellant's wife accompanying him certainly on a
      permanent basis or whether, for the purposes of the Rules, there  were
      no insurmountable obstacles to them living in Algeria.

  12. It seems to me that the Judge's decision to  dismiss  the  appellant's
      appeal is flawed for two reasons.  First, the Judge failed to give any
      reasons for his conclusion that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules, in particular, the  Judge  made
      no finding on whether there  are  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  the
      appellant and his wife continuing family life in Algeria.    Secondly,
      in relation to Article 8, the Judge failed  to  consider  whether  the
      appellant had any prospect of obtaining entry clearance to return as a
      spouse, in particular, the financial requirement of Appendix  FM.   If
      it was the case that  the  appellant  was  unlikely  to  obtain  entry
      clearance, the Judge made no findings on  whether:  (a)  it  would  be
      reasonable to expect the appellant's wife to live in Algeria with  the
      appellant given that she is a British citizen and would  shortly  give
      birth to a child who will be a British citizen; and,  if  it  was  not
      reasonable, whether the inevitable interference with their family life
      that would result was proportionate.

  13. The Judge's failure to make those findings amounted, in my  judgement,
      to errors of law which flawed his finding that the appellant's removal
      would not breach Article 8.  Although the legitimate aim of  effective
      immigration control merited considerable weight in this  appeal  given
      the appellant's very poor immigration history, I cannot  be  satisfied
      that this appeal would have inevitably failed.

Decision and Disposal

  14. As a consequence, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss
      the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and  Art  8  cannot
      stand and I set it aside.

  15. The decisions in respect of those grounds of appeal  must  be  remade.
      The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  decided  de
      novo.

  16. The Judge's decision to dismiss the appeal on asylum and  humanitarian
      protection grounds stands.
