Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr C Timson, instructed by Platt Halpern Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Khurram Shehzad, date of birth 17.8.84, is a citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Simpson promulgated 16.9.14, dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the secretary  of  State,  dated  2.12.13,  to  refuse  his
    application made on 24.9.12 to extend his discretionary leave to remain
    in the UK and to remove him from the UK  by  way  of  directions  under
    section 47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 24.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox granted permission to appeal on 29.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.1.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Simpson should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be summarised  as  follows.  The  appellant
    first came to the UK with leave as  a  spouse  in  2005.  In  2008  his
    application to extend leave to remain was refused, as his marriage  was
    no longer subsisting. However, he was granted  discretionary  leave  to
    remain until 1.10.12 on the basis of being  the  parent  of  a  British
    citizen child in respect of whom he was to commence access rights.

 7. The chronology set out at �2 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    discloses that over a period of 2 years and  10  months  prior  to  the
    application the subject of this appeal he spent 367 days  in  Pakistan.
    The  respondent  concluded  that  he  had  failed  to  such  sufficient
    developments in his case for access rights so as to warrant  a  further
    grant of leave. The latest documentation provided, dated 6.8.13, showed
    that he was to have indirect contact with his son,  via  post,  with  a
    letter sent once every three weeks. Although a case review was set  for
    28.1.14, there  was  no  indication  that  contact  was  likely  to  be
    increased. The appellant need not remain in the  UK  to  continue  such
    contact as he was permitted.

 8. As the appellant did not have access rights to his child  and  did  not
    provide evidence that he was taking and intended to continue to take an
    active  role  in  the  child's  upbringing,  he  failed  to  meet   the
    eligibility requirements of Appendix FM. Neither did he meet 2876ADE in
    respect of private life.

 9. At the hearing before Judge Simpson the appellant stated  that  at  the
    last family hearing on 10.6.14, a new CAFCASS report  was  commissioned
    because his wife reported that their child no longer wished to see  the
    appellant. A new hearing date was fixed  for  September  2014,  some  3
    months after the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.

10. Between �7 and �10 the judge set out the appellant's case and evidence.
    The judge concluded at �13 that the appellant had only limited  contact
    rights with his child and thus that there was nothing to show  that  he
    was taking and intending to continue to take  an  active  role  in  the
    child's upbringing and thus failed to meet LTRPT 2.4. At �14 the  judge
    found that the appellant  could  exercise  his  indirect  contact  from
    anywhere in the world and did not need to be in the UK to do  so,  thus
    dismissing the appeal on all grounds.

11. In granting permission to appeal Judge Cox found arguable merit in  the
    grounds. "Given that the judge was aware  of  ongoing  proceedings  for
    contact with the appellant's child, that a new CAFCASS  report  was  in
    preparation, that a further hearing date had been fixed  for  September
    (she heard the appeal on 24th June) and that the appellant already  had
    an order for indirect contact, it is arguable that she materially erred
    in pre-empting, in effect, the decision of the FPC and  dismissing  the
    appeal outright on the basis that the unrepresented appellant  had  not
    satisfied her that he met the requirements of E-LTRPT 2.4. The  grounds
    disclose an arguable material error of law  in  the  determination  and
    permission is granted."

12. For the reasons set out herein, I disagree with Judge Cox and find that
    there was no material error of law in the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

13. Appendix FM provides a route for leave to remain in  the  circumstances
    of a parent exercising access to a British citizen  child.  Whilst  the
    appellant had access rights, at the date of the appeal hearing they had
    been limited to indirect contact by letter. In the  circumstances,  the
    appellant could not demonstrate as is required in E-LTRPT 2.4  that  he
    is taking and intends to continue to take an active role in the child's
    upbringing. Despite the appellant's intentions  and  the  then  pending
    further proceedings, the evidence before the judge was to the contrary.
    The appellant was not and could not properly be described as taking  an
    active role in the child's  upbringing.  At  the  date  of  the  appeal
    hearing,  the  indications  were  that  the  further  proceedings  were
    instigated by the appellant's former wife on the basis that  the  child
    did not want  to  see  the  appellant  at  all.  In  other  words,  the
    consideration was not  as  to  whether  access  or  contact  should  be
    increased but whether it should be terminated. In  this  regard,  Judge
    Simpson noted that there had been allegations of raped against the  ex-
    wife and of assault on the child, neither of which had progressed to  a
    prosecution. The judge had also noted the lengthy period  of  time  the
    appellant had spent outside the UK.

14. The Rule 24 response to the appeal, dated 14.11.14, submits that it was
    clear that at the date of the First-tier Tribunal  appeal  hearing  the
    appellant did not meet  the  relevant  immigration  rules  relating  to
    contact. No application was made to adjourn the hearing and  it  cannot
    thus be said to have been an error  for  the  judge  to  determine  the
    matter of the facts as they pertained at the date of the hearing.

15. Mr  Timson  took  a  preliminary  point  that  under  the  transitional
    arrangements and UKBA Guidance chapter  8,  an  application  to  extend
    discretionary leave would be considered  under  that  policy,  provided
    that the circumstances have not changed. It follows, he submitted, that
    the judge was in error  to  consider  the  matter  under  Appendix  FM.
    However, that was neither pleaded in the grounds of appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal nor in the the grounds of application for  permission  to
    appeal and there had been  no  application  to  amend  the  grounds  of
    appeal. Mr Timson suggested that it was a Robinson obvious  point,  and
    should have been considered by the judge even though not pleaded.

16. I disagree with Mr Timson's submissions. It was not  an  obvious  point
    and neither having been pleaded nor raised in argument before the First-
    tier Tribunal, nor addressed in any skeleton argument, I declined leave
    to add it as a ground of appeal at this stage. I also note  in  passing
    that that the guidance Mr Timson relied  on  is  dated  November  2014,
    after the date of the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing. He was unable
    to produce to me any relevant guidance in force  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing before Judge Simpson.

17. In any event, the transitional arrangements provided,  "Applicants  who
    were granted leave under the Discretionary Leave policy before  9  July
    2012 will continue to  be  considered  under  that  policy  through  to
    settlement, provided they continue  to  qualify  for  leave  and  their
    circumstances have not changed." The appellant's circumstances had very
    clearly changed since the grant  of  discretionary  leave,  his  access
    rights had been reduced by order of the court  on  6.8.13  to  indirect
    contact by letter. His discretionary leave  had  been  granted  on  the
    basis that he was pursuing access  rights  through  the  courts;  those
    proceedings had resolved against him. The only further proceedings were
    instituted not by him but by his wife to terminate all contact. In  the
    circumstances, there were very significant changes in circumstances and
    there is no merit in the argument  that  the  judge  was  in  error  in
    considering the matter under Appendix FM, as did the Secretary of State
    in the refusal decision.

18. Mr Timson also submitted that  the  judge  should  have  adjourned  the
    hearing, even though there was no application by the  appellant  to  do
    so, on the basis of the joint protocol, date 19.7.13.  Paragraph  6  of
    this explains that  it  is  not  the  role  of  the  judges  in  either
    jurisdiction to predict the outcome of the  proceedings  in  the  other
    jurisdictions. "Where the decision in the Family Court is likely to  be
    a weighty consideration in the immigration decision, it is  anticipated
    that it will normally be necessary for the Tribunal to wait  until  the
    Family Court judge has reached a decision on the issue relevant to  the
    immigration appeal. If  so,  either  appeal  will  be  allowed  by  the
    Tribunal in anticipation of a short period of leave  being  granted  or
    the hearing will be adjourned, depending on the  anticipated  timescale
    of the family proceedings."

19. In Mohammed (Family Court proceedings  -  outcome)  [2014]  UKUT  00419
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal panel held that whilst there was  always  the
    possibility of a parent making a fresh application relating to contact,
    there is nothing in guidance approved  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  that
    supports the notion that the mere possibility of  such  an  application
    being made or pursued is  a  relevant  criterion  in  the  case  of  an
    immigration appeal when deciding whether to adjourn  an  appeal  or  to
    direct a grant of discretionary leave in order for such proceedings  to
    be pursued.  "The  guidance  is  concerned  with  whether  there  is  a
    realistic prospect of the Family Court making a decision that will have
    a material impact on the relationship between a child  and  the  parent
    facing immigration measures such as deportation."

20. In that case the Tribunal considered it significant that the  appellant
    in that case had been granted only indirect  contact  via  letters  and
    video link. "There was nothing to show  that  the  order  for  indirect
    contact was qualified by any suggestion that it  might  be  changed  to
    direct contact. In short, the documentary evidence  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal established that the Family Court has reached a concluded
    view as to the best interests of the child  which  identified  them  as
    entailing no direct contact with the appellant.  Whilst  the  appellant
    sought in evidence to claim that the Family Court left  open  that  the
    appellant could become more directly  involved  in  K's  life,  he  had
    simply failed to substantiate that claim. That claim  was  at  best  an
    explanation of his own aspiration." It was also pointed  out  that  the
    burden of proof was on the appellant. The Upper Tribunal found that  it
    was  entirely  proportionate  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  panel  to
    consider that the  appellant's  removal  would  not  prevent  him  from
    maintaining from abroad an indirect contact of a similar kind  that  he
    had been granted in the UK.

21. The grounds of application for permission to appeal complaint that at a
    hearing on 8.8.14, the Family Court had directed a  pre-hearing  review
    for 29.9.14 and final hearings for 8.10.14  and  10.10.14.  It  is  not
    clear whether this information was provided to Judge Simpson.  However,
    I was told that the matter  remains  unresolved  even  now.  I  am  not
    satisfied  that  the  circumstances  of  this  case  fall  within   the
    provisions of the protocol set out  above.  The  circumstances  of  the
    appellant in Mohammed are not  dissimilar  to  the  available  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal in the present case. It appears that the
    pending decision in the Family Court was whether to termination contact
    altogether, on the basis that  the  child  did  not  wish  to  see  the
    appellant. There was no evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and
    none before me today, to suggest  that  there  was  likely  to  be  any
    increase in contact between the appellant and his son, or that  he  had
    made any application for such, although  he  made  it  clear  to  judge
    Simpson that he wished to pursue contact with his son. On the  evidence
    available to the First-tier Tribunal, this is  not  a  case  where  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal was likely to pre-empt the decision
    of the Family Court. In the circumstances there is  no  merit  in  this
    submission, which was not in  any  event  pleaded  in  the  grounds  of
    application for permission to appeal.

22. In the circumstances, I find no error of law in the decision  of  Judge
    Simpson. She assessed the available evidence and reached  a  conclusion
    that was open to her on that evidence and for which cogent reasons have
    been provided. The appellant did not meet the requirements of  Appendix
    FM and there is no basis for considering that any article 8  assessment
    on the same facts would demonstrate that the decision of the  Secretary
    of State was either unjustifiably  harsh  or  disproportionate  to  the
    appellant's article 8 ECHR right to respect for  family  life.  As  the
    judge pointed out, such family life as he had with his child  had  been
    assessed and limited by the Family Court and he did not need to  be  in
    the UK to exercise the limited degree of contact the Family  Court  had
    ordered in the best interests of the child.

Conclusion & Decision:

23. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
