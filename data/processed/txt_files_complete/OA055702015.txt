Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tarlow
For the Respondent:    Mr Victor-Mazeli

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Ms Ait is a citizen of Morocco born in 1974.  She  appealed  against  a
    decision of the ECO, Paris who in a  decision  dated  29  January  2015
    refused her application for  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse  of  Hamid
    Moudjeb under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. Although  for  proceedings  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  ECO  is  the
    Appellant, for convenience I retain the designations as  they  were  in
    proceedings  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  thus  Ms  Ait  is  the
    Appellant and the ECO, the Respondent.

    Respondent's reasons

 3. It was  noted  in  the  refusal  letter  that  the  Appellant  met  the
    suitability,  relationship  and  eligibility  requirements,  also   the
    English language requirements.  However in relation  to  the  financial
    requirements it was noted that the Sponsor was not  exempt  from  those
    defined by E-ECP3.3.  The Respondent was not able to take into  account
    any potential employment in the UK or offers of financial support  from
    third parties.  The Appellant was therefore required to demonstrate  an
    income of �18,600 and the mandatory documents relating to employment as
    set out in Appendix FM-SE were required.

 4. Although it was  noted  that  she  had  provided  pay  slips  and  bank
    statements covering six months immediately prior to the application, on
    self-employment being combined  with  the  employment  income  all  the
    evidence provided had to be from the same  financial  year.   Thus  the
    only employment that could be taken into account  was  that  which  was
    taken from financial year 2013/2014.  The Appellant  had  not  provided
    any employment evidence from the relevant financial year and  therefore
    this could not be taken into account.

 5. In order to demonstrate the Sponsor's self-employment evidence was also
    required and the only evidence of self-employment provided  was  an  SA
    302 and evidence of national insurance payments.   The  Respondent  was
    not satisfied that they had provided  the  necessary  documentation  to
    demonstrate the Sponsor was earning the required amount of �18,600  per
    annum.

 6. In relation to Article 8 of the ECHR it was noted  that  there  was  no
    reason why the Sponsor was unable  to  travel  to  Morocco  or  another
    country to  be  with  the  Appellant  and  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances which were raised consistent with a right to respect  for
    private and family life contained in Article 8.

 7. In the review dated 12 June 2015 it  was  noted  that  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal stated that the Sponsor had earned the required amount through a
    combination of salaried work and self-employment.  However, as  already
    noted when self-employment was being combined with employed income  all
    the evidence provided had to be from the same  financial  year  and  no
    evidence of salaried employment for the  relevant  financial  year  was
    provided with the application.  Although it was noted that  a  P60  had
    been provided with the appeal, none of the required specified  evidence
    had been provided as listed in Appendix FM-SE and as specified  in  the
    refusal letter for the relevant financial year.

 8. Additionally, in respect of self-employed income it was  noted  that  a
    tax return, company accounts and evidence of  tax  paid  had  now  been
    provided, however this was not all the specified evidence  required  by
    Appendix FM-SE.  It was noted there were no  bank  statements  provided
    for the full financial year which showed  income  from  self-employment
    being received.  It was not considered that the evidential balance  had
    been tipped in the Appellant's favour.

 9. She appealed.

    First tier hearing

10. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 22 September 2016 Judge  of  the
    First-tier tribunal Iqbal allowed the appeal under the Rules.

11. It was agreed by the parties that the Appellant met the requirements of
    Appendix FM-SE  insofar  as  employment  was  concerned.   However  the
    Respondent maintained that the bank statements submitted did  not  show
    self-employment.

12. The judge's findings are at paragraph 23ff.  Having  noted  documentary
    evidence provided by the  Sponsor  she  found  that  they  did  confirm
    claimed income from employment of �14,644.

13. Turning to  self-employment  she  noted  (at  [26])  various  documents
    provided, including the SA 302 which confirmed earnings of �4,306  from
    self-employment as well as �14,644 from employment.

14. Having set out the other  documents  provided  to  the  Tribunal  which
    included twelve months' bank statements covering  the  relevant  period
    she continued:

         "... (the) bank statements for the relevant year do not demonstrate
         the monies received from his self employment  given  the  Sponsor's
         explanation that he was paid in cash and did not deposit the monies
         in his account, rather, he used it towards expenses.

         The Sponsor confirmed that he ran a small business but that all the
         evidence surrounding his self employment  confirmed  his  earnings,
         including that tax was  being  paid  therefore  he  was  running  a
         genuine business".

15. The  judge  had  noted  the  relevant  paragraphs  of  Appendix  FM-SE,
    including

         "7.  In respect of self employment in the UK as  a  partner,  as  a
             sole trader or in a franchise all of  the  following  must  be
             provided:

             ...

             (f)  personal bank statements for the same 12 month period  as
                  the tax  return(s)  showing  that  the  income  from  self
                  employment has been paid into an account in  the  name  of
                  the person or in the name of the person and their  partner
                  jointly ...".

16. In noting the concession that the Appellant could not demonstrate  that
    the income from self-employment was contained in the  bank  statements,
    given the Sponsor's evidence  that  money  was  not  deposited  in  the
    account, the judge then considered the  submission  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that the Respondent ought to have exercised discretion  under
    Appendix  FM-SE,  paragraph  D,  alternatively,  that   if   evidential
    discretion had been exercised it has not been exercised correctly.

17. The judge at [30] found that the Respondent had considered the exercise
    of evidential flexibility and the discretion afforded by it.

18. In going on to consider whether it had  been  exercised  correctly  she
    stated: "the requirements of the paragraph [D] set out,  that  where  a
    document does not  contain  all  the  specified  information,  but  the
    missing information is verifiable from other documents  submitted  with
    the application then providing the  decision  maker  is  satisfied  the
    document is genuine and the applicant meets the requirements  to  which
    the  document  relates,   then   the   application   may   be   granted
    exceptionally" [31].

19. The judge concluded (at [32]):

         "I find on balance that bank statements are the specified evidence,
         but from which specified information, that is  the  Sponsor's  self
         employment income, is missing.  No question is  raised  as  to  the
         genuineness of the bank statements, therefore given I find that the
         Sponsor has offered a reasonable explanation as  to  why  the  bank
         statements do not contain the information, that is, he is paid cash
         in hand, I find that the Respondent is exercising  his  discretion,
         ought  to  have  allowed  the  appeal  on  an  exceptional   basis.
         Especially as the Sponsor's self employment is verifiable from  all
         other specified documents that I have listed above."

20. The Respondent sought permission to appeal  which  was  granted  on  25
    April 2017.

    Error of law hearing

21. At the error of law hearing before me  Mr  Tarlow  submitted  that  the
    judge's decision to allow the appeal on the basis that  the  evidential
    flexibility provisions within Appendix FM-SE should have been exercised
    differently was contrary to the approach set out in Sultana and  Others
    (rules: waiver/further enquiry; discretion)  [2014]  UKUT  00540  which
    stated that "(2) where applicants wish to invoke any discretion of this
    kind,  they  should  do  so  when  making  the  relevant   application,
    highlighting the specific provisions  of  the  Rules  invoked  and  the
    grounds upon which the exercise of discretion is requested".

22. The Appellant failed to follow that procedure.  The First-tier  Judge's
    decision in failing to apply the law should be set aside and remade  by
    dismissing the appeal. Mr Victor-Mazeli in response submitted that  the
    approach had been appropriate and the decision was sustainable.

    Consideration

23. In considering this matter there is no  dispute  that  every  applicant
    must satisfy the applicable requirements  of  Appendix  FM  and  FM-SE,
    including those pertaining to the stipulated documentary evidence.   In
    the context of this appeal, as Judge Iqbal noted, the key provision  is
    contained in paragraph [7] of FM-SE:

         "In respect of self employment in the UK as a partner,  as  a  sole
         trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:

         (a)  Evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid or unpaid for  the
             last full financial year...

         (b)  The following documents for the last  full  financial  year...



             (i)  annual self assessment tax return  to  HMRC  (a  copy  or
                  print out).

             (ii) statement of account (SA 300 or SA 302).

         (c)  Proof of registration with HMRC as self employed if available.



         (d)  Each partner's Unique Tax Reference Number  (UTR)  and/or  the
             UTR of the partnership or business.

         (e)  Where the person  holds  or  held  a  separate  business  bank
             account, bank statements for the same 12 month period  as  the
             tax return.

         (f)  Personal bank statements for the same 12 month period  as  the
             tax return(s) showing that the income from self employment has
             been paid into the account in the name of the person or in the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.

         (g)  Evidence of ongoing self employment through ...  [one  of  the
             specified documentary sources]".

24.  This  appeal  centres  on  the  personal   bank   account   evidential
    requirements in paragraph 7(f) of the Appendix.  There is no claim that
    the Appellant had a business bank account.

25. It is accepted that the bank statements in  respect  of  the  Sponsor's
    business were non compliant with paragraph 7(f) because, it is claimed,
    he is paid in cash and did not put the money in the  account  using  it
    instead for expenses.

26. It is clear that the ECO did not have with the application the required
    twelve months' bank statements required for  self-employment.   Indeed,
    the only evidence before him  was  an  SA  302,  evidence  of  national
    insurance payments and six  months'  bank  statements  for  the  period
    immediately before the application (the date of which is unclear).

27. It does not appear that  the  ECO  was  asked  to  exercise  evidential
    discretion and he did not do so.  As the provisions confer a discretion
    on the ECO confined to cases where  the  applicants  have  submitted  a
    document in the wrong  format  or  a  copy  document,  rather  than  an
    original or a  document  which  does  not  contain  all  the  specified
    information, in light of  the  failure  to  provide  several  mandatory
    documents there is no basis for concluding that his failure to exercise
    discretion was not in accordance with the law.

28. The emphasis appears to be on the ECM's actions  following  receipt  of
    the Grounds of Appeal.  Several more of the  mandatory  documents  were
    submitted at that later stage but not the mandatory twelve months' bank
    statements covering the last full financial year.

29. The judge found that the ECM had considered the exercise of  evidential
    flexibility and the discretion afforded by it.  She concluded  that  it
    had not been correctly exercised.

30. The difficulty, in my judgement, is that the judge has proceeded on the
    erroneous basis that the ECM had before him all the mandatory documents
    that were put before her at the hearing (and as set out by her at [26].

31. In respect of the bank statements alone there  was  no  issue  of  them
    being in the wrong format or a copy.  Nor was it a matter of, e.g.  one
    bank statement from a series being missing or it being a document which
    did not contain all the specified information.  Rather it was the  case
    that at least six months of the required twelve  months  of  statements
    were missing.  In other words specified evidence was missing  entirely.



32. The ECM's decision not to exercise discretion in the Appellant's favour
    was unassailable.  The judge has materially erred  by  misunderstanding
    that the information before the ECM was not what was before  her.   The
    result is in applying paragraph D(d)(iii) of Appendix  FM-SE   she  has
    exercised the discretion based on all  the  mandatory  documents  being
    provided to her.  However  the  discretion  in  question  is  conferred
    exclusively on the Respondent and is not exercisable by the Tribunal.

33. There is a further difficulty and it is the one on which the Respondent
    principally relies.  In Sultana (at [20]) it is stated

         "... applicants and their advisers must obviously be alert  to  the
         totality of the applicable requirements enshrined in  Appendix  FM-
         SE.  Alertness to the various obligatory requirements is  obviously
         essential.  We would also encourage applicants and  their  advisers
         who consider that any of the discretionary powers conferred on  the
         ECO by paragraph  [D]  should  be  exercised  in  their  favour  to
         proactively make this case when submitting their  applications  ...
         if this Sponsor genuinely  cannot  provide  the  necessary  records
         concerning  his  decorating  business,  as  it  is  a  purely  cash
         enterprise he should in any fresh application, specifically  invoke
         paragraph [D](e) of the Appendix and  make  his  case  accordingly,
         advancing all  relevant  facts,  justifications  and  explanations.
         Issues of this kind belong firmly to the primary decision maker and
         should not be belatedly ventilated at the  stage  of  either  first
         instance or second instance appeal".

34. In failing to apply the guidance contained in Sultana  the  judge  also
    erred.



Notice of Decision

Giving effect to the above analysis and conclusion:

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material error of law.   It
is set aside.  I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal  and  thereby
affirm the decision of the ECO.

No anonymity direction is made.
