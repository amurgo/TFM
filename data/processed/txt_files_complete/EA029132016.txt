                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Lazar, Highland Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal issued on 22 June 2017 dismissing his appeal against  the
    respondent's decision made on 24 February 2016 refusing his application
    for a residence card as the extended family member of an  EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights in the UK.

2.    The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  born  on  25  May  1989.  He
    entered the UK on 8 September 2010 as a Tier 4 student. On 3  September
    2015 he applied for a residence card as  confirmation  of  a  right  to
    reside in the UK as the extended family member of an EEA national.  His
    application was refused for the reasons set  out  in  the  respondent's
    decision.

3.    The appellant appealed  against  this  decision  and  his  appeal  was
    allocated for a decision on the papers on 21 June 2017. In the light of
    the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of  Appeal)
    [2016] UKUT 411, the judge found that he had no  jurisdiction  to  hear
    the appeal.

4.    However, in Khan v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1755, the Court of Appeal held that there was jurisdiction  to
    hear an appeal against an extended family  member  decision.  This  has
    been confirmed by the Supreme Court in SM (Algeria) v  Entry  Clearance
    Officer [2018] UKSC 9.

5.    In the light of these judgements, Mr Avery conceded  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal and had erred in
    law by holding to the contrary. Both representatives accepted that  the
    proper course would be for the appeal to be remitted to the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a full hearing.

Decision

6.    The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and the decision that  there  was
    no jurisdiction to hear the appeal is set aside. The appeal is remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House for  reconsideration
    by a full hearing on the merits.
