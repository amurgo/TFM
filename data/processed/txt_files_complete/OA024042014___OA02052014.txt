Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Quinn  sitting  with  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Plumtre promulgated  3.12.14,  allowing  the  claimants'  appeals
    against the decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  their
    applications made on 3.12.13 for entry  clearance  as  adult  dependant
    relatives.  The First-tier Tribunal panel heard the appeal on 13.11.14.



 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 24.3.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was an error  of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside and remade.

 5. The relevant background is that by application dated either 29.11.13 or
    3.12.13 the claimants, husband and wife, sought entry clearance to  the
    UK as the dependent adult relatives of their son and sponsor in the UK,
    Mr Chran Jit Singh. The Entry Clearance Officer considered  that  there
    was insufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the  claimants  were  fully
    financially supported  by  the  sponsor;  that  despite  their  medical
    problems they were receiving adequate level of medical care  in  India;
    that they have extended family and friends to help; and  that  domestic
    help is available in India at modest cost. The Entry Clearance  Officer
    was not satisfied that the claimants were unable to obtain the required
    level of care, with reference to EC-DR.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal  purported  to  allow  the  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules and in consequence there was no  need  to  go  on  to
    consider article 8 in the decision.

 7. The grounds of appeal complain that it is not clear from  the  decision
    whether the appeals were allowed by reference to paragraph 317  or  the
    requirements of Appendix FM, but that in either case the  reasoning  is
    inadequate.

 8. In granting permission to  appeal  Judge  Cruthers  found  the  grounds
    arguable and in particular that inadequate reasons were given  for  the
    findings, reference being made to R (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 982.

 9. It is something of a mystery why the First-tier Tribunal made reference
    to paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules, since the correct provisions
    are those under section EC-DR of Appendix FM, which were not addressed.
    Paragraph A277 sets out that from 9.7.12 Appendix FM will apply to  all
    applications to which Part 8 applied on or before 8.7.12, except  where
    the provisions of Part 8 are preserved and continue to apply as set out
    in A280 to A280A. Those provisions do not preserve  paragraph  317  for
    applicants matching the circumstances of  the  claimants,  applications
    made after 9.7.12 from outside the UK. Ms Harris agreed that there  was
    no purpose in the Tribunal considering the  requirements  of  paragraph
    317at �26 of the decision. The applications were refused  by  reference
    to EC-DR and the First-tier Tribunal should have  carefully  considered
    the requirements of both EC-DR 2.4 and 2.5, as well as  the  evidential
    requirements under paragraphs 33-37 of Appendix FM-SE,  which  was  not
    done.

10. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal did not  consider  either  the
    requirements  of  EC-DR  2.4  and  2.5  or   the   specified   evidence
    requirements under Appendix FM-SE. In the circumstances,  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed for want  of  adequate  reasoning
    and must be set aside and remade.

11. It is  also  clear  that  the  application  was  poorly  prepared  with
    inadequate evidence to meet the requirements of EC-DR  of  Appendix  FM
    and paragraphs  33-37  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  to  the  extent  that  the
    application as made could not possibly have succeeded.

12. Under EC-DR 2.4 the claimants have to demonstrate  that  by  reason  of
    age, illness or disability they  require  long-term  personal  care  to
    perform everyday tasks. This  requires  independent  medical  evidence.
    There was no expert evidence and the  claimants  rely  on  the  medical
    records and two letters or notes. First, a handwritten  letter/note  at
    A79, in relation to the  male  claimant  only,  that  he  suffers  from
    progressively deteriorating vascular dementia, requiring daily care  by
    family members. It states that he is not able to carry  out  his  daily
    household work, and needs support for bathing, toilet or  walking.  "He
    should stay with his family member for better care  and  betterment  of
    his mental health." Second, a similar note at A82 in  relation  to  the
    female claimant states  that  she  is  not  able  to  carry  her  daily
    household works easily and needs permanent help to take  care  of  her.
    "It is advisable that she should  stay  with  the  family  and  may  be
    allowed for indefinite stay with the son and his family."

13. That evidence may be sufficient to meet the evidential requirements  of
    EC-DR 2.4, but under EC-DR 2.5, the appellant has to  demonstrate  that
    each is unable, even with the  practical  and  financial  help  of  the
    sponsor, to obtain the required level of care in India, because  either
    it is not available and there is no person  in  that  country  who  can
    reasonably provide it,  or  it  is  not  affordable.  Paragraph  36  of
    Appendix FM-SE requires that evidence that  the  appellant  is  unable,
    even with the practical and financial help of the sponsor in the UK, to
    obtain the required level of care should be from either  a  central  or
    local health authority, a local authority, or a doctor or other  health
    professional. However, no satisfactory evidence was adduced relating to
    the ability of the claimants at the date  of  decision  to  access  the
    necessary level of care in  India.  Whilst  the  doctor  may  think  it
    desirable that the claimants be looked after by family members  in  the
    UK, the evidence falls far short of demonstrating  that  any  necessary
    care is not available in India with the practical and financial help of
    the sponsor, or that there is no person in India who  could  reasonably
    provide such care, or that it is not affordable. The evidence suggested
    that in addition to the pension income and regular money transfers from
    the sponsor, the sponsor also gave his parents  lump  sums  "to  ensure
    that they are not left wanting." Further, the property occupied by  the
    claimants is worth �30,000 and could be sold to help pay for  care,  or
    enable them to move into a retirement home. Daily  domestic  assistance
    is also available in India.

14. In summary, the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal does  not  meet
    the requirements of EC-DR or Appendix FM-SE and  in  the  circumstances
    the application and appeal were doomed to failure from the outset.

15. Further, by reason of paragraph 37 of FM-SE if it is suggested that the
    level of care is not, or is no longer, affordable, the  appellant  must
    provide records of what care has been provided and  an  explanation  of
    why that cannot continue. If financial support has been provided by the
    sponsor or other close family in the UK, the claimants must provide  an
    explanation of why this cannot continue or is no longer  sufficient  to
    enable the required level  of  care  to  be  provided.  None  of  these
    considerations have been addressed in the documentation submitted  with
    the application or for the appeal. It appears that  these  requirements
    have been overlooked in the preparation of both application and appeal.

16. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the appellants have  failed
    to demonstrate that even if they do require long-term personal care  to
    perform everyday tasks, taking the evidence in the case as a whole,  in
    the round, I find that they have failed to demonstrate  that  they  are
    unable to obtain the required level of care, given that  practical  and
    financial help is available  through  the  sponsor,  and  indeed  other
    family members. They thus do not meet the threshold requirements of the
    Immigration  Rules  for  entry  in  the  capacity  of  dependent  adult
    relatives. In the circumstances it is very clear that at  the  date  of
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer the claimants did  not  qualify
    for entry clearance under EC-DR.

17.  By  reason  of  section  85A  the  Tribunal  can  only  consider   the
    circumstances prevailing at the date of decision. Thus  the  fact  that
    the second claimant is now said to be in the ICU in hospital  in  India
    is not relevant to the immigration issues in the appeal.

18. Ms Harris relied on article 8 family life. I note that  article  8  was
    not raised in the grounds of appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    there is no section 120 notice, though Ms Harris maintains that article
    8 was raised during the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  Therefore,  after
    setting aside the decision for error of law  and  before  remaking  the
    decision in the appeal I heard submissions in relation  to  article  8,
    considering the Razgar stepped approach.

19. I am not satisfied that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer  to
    refuse  the  application  causes  such  grave  interference  with   the
    claimants' family life so as to engage article 8 at all.  In  my  view,
    there is no merit in any article 8 claim outside the Rules.  Ms  Harris
    suggested that there were emotional ties and  dependency  going  beyond
    the normal emotional ties to be expected between adult relatives and  I
    have borne in mind the Kugathas principles and that in  cases  such  as
    Ghising and others (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong; weight) [2013]  UKUT
    00567 (IAC),  and Gurung and others [2013] EWCA Civ 8, it was held that
    it is possible for family life to continue even though  family  members
    have voluntarily separated. Whilst I accept that there is a  degree  of
    family life between sponsor and parents, the decision in question  does
    not alter the family life situation at all, and leaves the  status  quo
    intact. The claimants have lived in India all  their  lives  and  their
    children chose to settle in the UK. Their separation is not an enforced
    one. There never was any intention that they should  live  together  in
    the UK. The type and extent of family life between  the  claimants  and
    their family members in the UK is the same as  it  has  been  for  many
    years, with the claimants in India and the sponsor and  his  family  in
    the UK. I accept that as they have aged, the claimants wish  to  depend
    more on their family members for support. However, that does  not  mean
    that article 8 entitles them to come to live in the UK. It is  entirely
    open to the sponsor to continue to visit the  claimants  in  India  and
    indeed I was told that he was there now, explaining  his  absence  from
    the appeal. Further, there is no reason why financial  sponsorship  and
    occasional visits cannot continue.

20. Even if article 8 is engaged, following Razgar the crucial issue  would
    be the proportionality  balancing  exercise  between  the  family  life
    rights of the claimants on the one hand and on the other the  undoubted
    legitimate and necessary public interest  in  protecting  the  economic
    well-being of the UK through immigration control. I bear in  mind  that
    when an applicant has shown that there is family/private life  and  the
    decision made by the Entry Clearance  Officer  or  Secretary  of  State
    amounts to an interference with it, the burden lies with the Respondent
    to show that a decision to remove is proportionate.

21. I take into account all that has been urged on behalf of the appellants
    and in particular  their  mental  and  physical  health  conditions  as
    outlined in the medical records, together  with  the  extent  of  their
    close bond with family members in the UK. However, I also have to  take
    into account that through financial and  practical  assistance  of  the
    sponsor they can have access  to  domestic  help  and  as  the  sponsor
    conceded in his oral evidence to the  First-tier  Tribunal  their  home
    could be sold to fund residence in a care home.  Suggestions  that  the
    claimants would not trust someone to come into their  home  or  not  be
    safe with such carers carry little weight  in  the  absence  of  cogent
    evidence. It remains  the  case  that  the  claimants  have  failed  to
    demonstrate that they cannot have the care they need in India, which is
    a highly relevant

22. In favour of the public  interest  in  that  balancing  exercise  I  am
    required to take account of section 117B of the 2002 Act, which  states
    that immigration control is in the public interest. More  significantly
    under section 117B(2)  it  is  also  in  the  public  interest  and  in
    particular in the interests of the economic well-being  of  the  United
    Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
    are able to speak English, because persons who can speak  English-  (a)
    are less of a burden on taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate
    into society. Further, under 117B(3) It is in the public interest,  and
    in particular in the interests of the economic well-being of the United
    Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
    are financially independent, because such persons- (a) are not a burden
    on taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into society.

23. There is no evidence  that  the  claimants  speak  English  and  it  is
    certainly the case that they  are  not  financially  independent.  With
    their ill-health it is undoubtedly the case  that  they  will  wish  to
    access NHS medical treatment and thus will likely be a  burden  on  the
    state, regardless of any claim to state financial assistance.

24. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with  the  Immigration  Rules
    and the claimants are not entitled to settle in  the  UK  just  because
    that is their desire or the will of their family  members  in  the  UK.
    There is a route for entry  clearance  in  the  capacity  of  an  adult
    dependant relative and the claimants have failed  to  demonstrate  that
    they meet the requirements of those Rules, which is  the  Secretary  of
    State's  proportionate  response  to  family  life   claims   in   such
    situations. If the claimants believe that they can muster the necessary
    evidence, it is open to them to make a further application, ensuring on
    this occasion that those acting on their behalf understand and  address
    the evidential requirements under both Appendix FM  and  the  specified
    evidence requirements under Appendix FM-SE.

25. Given  that  it  is  open  to  the  claimants  to  make  such  a  fresh
    application, I find it difficult to  understand  how  the  decision  to
    refuse  to  grant  the  inadequately  evidenced  application  could  be
    disproportionate to the claimants' rights under article 8  ECHR.  There
    is no reason why article 8 should exempt the claimants  from  making  a
    settlement application in the same way as  any  other  adult  dependant
    relative,  addressing  the  evidential  requirements.  Taking  all  the
    factors into consideration together, in the round, it is clear that the
    decision was entirely proportionate  to  the  claimants'  rights  under
    article 8 ECHR.

Conclusions:

26. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal of each claimant.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
