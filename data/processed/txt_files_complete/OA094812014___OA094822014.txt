               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms C Fielden (Counsel instructed)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are mother and daughter.  The first appellant  was  born
    on 29 October 1984  and  is  a  citizen  of  the  Palestinian  Occupied
    Territories.  The second appellant is the daughter born on [ ] 2013 and
    is a citizen of Libya.  The sponsor, Mr Emadedin Khayal, is  a  British
    citizen born on 26 October 1975.

2.   The appellants appeal against a decision made  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Aujla) ("FTT") promulgated on  2  September  2015  in  which  he
    dismissed the appeal in respect of the Immigration Rules and  on  human
    rights grounds under Article 8.

3.   The appellant applied for entry clearance to join the  sponsor  as  his
    spouse.  The daughter's application was made in line with that  of  the
    first appellant.  The Secretary of State refused the  application  with
    reference to Appendix FM at paragraphs EC-P.1.1(c), S-EC.2.2(a) and EC-
    P.1.1(d) and E-ECP.3.1.  The evidence relied on  by  the  appellant  in
    connection with the sponsor's earnings and employment was found not  to
    be genuine.  The respondent relied on  S-EC.2.2(a)  namely  that  false
    information representation documents had been submitted in relation  to
    the application.  For  the  same  reason  the  respondent  refused  the
    application under the eligibility requirements with  reference  to  the
    financial  requirements  under  3.1.   The  respondent  relied  on  two
    document verification  reports  ("DVR").   The  first  DVR  dealt  with
    evidence submitted with the application and the second DVR  dealt  with
    evidence including payslips and a P60 submitted  with  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  The respondent reviewed the decision and upheld the refusal in
    an explanatory statement.

The FTT Decision

4.   The FTT expressed the standard of proof as the civil standard  [  11  &
    14] and referred to the burden of proof on the respondent.

5.   The FTT recorded the sponsor's evidence  about  his  earnings  and  the
    payslips produced by his employer following his request for evidence of
    earnings in connection with his wife's application for entry  clearance
    [23].  The FTT noted that the appellant's representative conceded  that
    there were problems with the payslips but he relied on  the  P60  which
    showed earnings consistent with HMRC records.

6.   At [31] the FTT found the appellant failed to produce  proper  payslips
    and found that these were not genuine.  The sponsor had  not  explained
    discrepancies shown in the payslips, the claimed earnings did not match
    records held by HMRC.  It placed little weight on the  P60  as  it  was
    issued by the sponsor's employer.  It was accepted that  tax  had  been
    paid by the sponsor in  the  sum  of  ï¿½6,894.60.   The  FTT  found  the
    evidence to be consistent with the second DVR, that the evidence showed
    possible contrived earnings.


     Grounds of Application

7.   The grounds were drafted by the sponsor as follows:

    (i)  The appellant has now obtained full and frank wage  slips  of  her
         partner these wage slips correspond with the HMRC evidence  of  tax
         and national insurance paid to her husband.


    (ii) The Immigration Judge erred by  reaching  a  conclusion  that  the
         appellant had contrived her partner's earnings without allowing him
         sufficient time to gather the correct evidence was a material error
         of law.


    (iii)    To find the appellant's husband has contrived to  conceal  his
         earnings effectively places a bar on the appellant  being  reunited
         with her husband for the next ten years.


    (iv) Furthermore, the Immigration Judge erred in law by failing to give
         adequate consideration in accordance with Razgar  when  determining
         that the appellant or her daughter had not met  Article  8  of  the
         ECHR.  No reasons were given for this.

8.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  M
    Hollingworth on 15 February 2006.  He  also  granted  an  extension  of
    time.


9.   FTJ Hollingworth found an arguable error of law had arisen in  relation
    to the standard of proof which the respondent must reach with reference
    to paragraphs 14 and 32 of the  FTT  decision  which  referred  to  the
    balance of probabilities.  Permission was granted  on  the  basis  that
    "The judge has not particularised or used appropriate words to indicate
    the place on the spectrum of the balance of probabilities which must be
    reached by the respondent in order  for  the  burden  of  proof  to  be
    discharged." [No permission was granted in respect of  the  grounds  of
    application as drafted by the sponsor.]

Rule 24 Response

10.  The respondent opposed the appeal arguing that the FTT directed  itself
    appropriately.  At paragraph 32 of the decision  and  reasons  the  FTT
    referred to the correct burden  of  proof;  the  respondent  needed  to
    establish on the balance of probabilities that  the  documents  showing
    the sponsor's earnings were not genuine (see  re  B  (children)  [2008]
    UKHL 35).  The FTT gave adequate reasons in paragraphs 28 to 32  as  to
    why the documents were not reliable.

Error of Law Hearing

Preliminary Issue

11.  At the start of the hearing I drew Ms Fielden's attention to  terms  of
    grant of permission specifically as  to  the  burden  and  standard  of
    proof.  There was no ground in support of that issue and no application
    for leave to amend had been made.

12.  Mr Clarke submitted that the  UT  was  not  required  to  consider  any
    ground of appeal other than  those  included  in  the  application  (E.
    Miftari [2005] EWCA Civ 481).

13.  Ms Fielden made an application  for  leave  to  amend  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  The sponsor had drafted the grounds himself and at that  stage
    was acting in person.  The  permitting  judge  had  raised  an  obvious
    point.

Leave to amend
14.  I granted permission to amend the grounds of appeal pursuant to Rule  5
    (Tribunal Procedure Rules (Upper Tribunal)  2008)  to  incorporate  the
    ground  that  the  FTT  erred  by  failing  to  particularise  or   use
    appropriate words to indicate the place on the spectrum of the  balance
    of probabilities that must be reached by the respondent  in  order  for
    the burden of proof to be discharged.


Submissions

15.  Ms Fielden relied on written submissions and expanded on the same.  The
    current  position  as  submitted  by  Ms   Fielden   is   that   whilst
    acknowledging that there were difficulties "with the payslips relied on
    by the sponsor", there was no deception by the appellant or sponsor  as
    the payslips were produced by his employer.  There was  other  evidence
    before the FTT that was capable of showing that the sponsor had met the
    financial requirements.  In any event Ms Fielden acknowledged that  the
    appeal ought to have been dismissed as the appellant failed to meet the
    specified documents requirements.  Her main concern was that there  had
    been no dishonesty on the part of the appellant or sponsor.

16.  As to the main ground of appeal, Ms Fielden argued that the FTT  failed
    to  express  the  qualification  or  flexibility   that   arises   when
    considering an allegation of deception.  It is necessary for the FTT to
    have regard to the very  serious  consequences  for  the  appellant  in
    making any future applications.  She further argued that  the  scrutiny
    of the evidence carried out by the FTT was  inadequate.   She  accepted
    that the payslips were unreliable evidentially but that they  had  been
    produced by the sponsor's employer.  She argued that  the  approach  to
    the standard of proof required by the FTT was in accordance with  Ghiri
    (paragraphs 36 and 37) which required a degree of  flexibility  in  its
    application to the extent that the  more  serious  the  allegation  the
    stronger the need for cogent evidence.  She indicated that a heightened
    degree of scrutiny was required and that the  FTT  erred  by  referring
    simply to the standard of proof as the balance of probabilities.

17.  Mr Clarke submitted that there was no error of law.  The  FTT  had  set
    out and applied the correct civil standard of proof and the  burden  of
    proof was on the respondent.  The decision and  reasons  showed  proper
    scrutiny of the evidence before the FTT.  The payslips were  found  not
    to be genuine.  The sponsor had been fully aware of the refusal reasons
    and the concerns raised as  to  the  reliability  of  the  evidence  in
    particular the payslips.  He failed to deal with those concerns by  way
    of any proper explanation at  the  FTT  hearing.   The  FTT  found  the
    payslips  together  with  inconsistencies  had  all  the  hallmarks  of
    contrived earnings.  Mr Clarke submitted that in such circumstances  it
    was difficult to see how the evidence could not have been  regarded  as
    strong or cogent.

Discussion and Decision

18.  The two grounds of appeal drafted by the sponsor were  not  pursued  by
    Ms Fielden and therefore I do not propose to consider the same.

19.   It was common ground that the standard of proof is the civil  standard
    namely the balance of probabilities and that when considering issues in
    relation  to  deception  it  is  necessary  to  import  some  level  of
    flexibility to the extent that the respondent must produce and rely  on
    strong and cogent evidence to meet the standard of proof.

20.  As to the substance of this appeal  I  must  consider  whether  or  not
    there was a  material  error  of  law  by  FTT  having  regard  to  the
    application of the correct standard of  proof.   I  am  satisfied  that
    although it expressed the burden and standard  of  proof  correctly  at
    paragraphs 11 and 14, there was no reference to any flexibility  as  to
    the quality of the evidence  relied  on.   I  find  no  basis  for  any
    argument that the FTT failed to consider the evidence with a sufficient
    level of scrutiny. The FTT dealt with the particular concerns raised by
    the respondent as to the reliability of the financial evidence and gave
    the sponsor every opportunity to explain and deal with those concerns.

21.  Whilst accepting that no specific reference was made by the FTT to  the
    need for strong and cogent evidence in order to  discharge  the  burden
    and standard of proof that false documents were used,  I  am  satisfied
    that the FTT found that the respondent had relied on strong and  cogent
    evidence, namely the payslips produced by the appellant as evidence  of
    his employment /earnings.  The FTT also referred to the  fact  that  at
    the hearing the appellant's representative acknowledged that there were
    problems with the payslips. It is now conceded by Ms Fielden  that  the
    payslips were not reliable evidence of the appellant's  earnings.   The
    FTT made clear findings that those documents could not be relied on  as
    an accurate reflection of  the  sponsor's  earnings.  According  to  Ms
    Fielden the sponsor now claims that he lost his original  payslips  and
    asked his employer to produce a further set. That explanation  was  not
    put to the FTT and the fact remains that the payslips, which were found
    to show false information, were adduced with  the  grounds  of  appeal.
    The fact that they were purportedly produced by  his  employer  is  not
    material as it was the appellant\sponsor who used them as  evidence  in
    response to the concerns raised about his earnings and employment.

22.  Whilst accepting that there was  a  P60  in  evidence  before  the  FTT
    capable of supporting  the  appellant's  claim  that  her  husband  was
    earning and that P60 tallied with HMRC records, however the  FTT  found
    that the P60 was not reliable evidence as it  came  from  his  employer
    rather than from HMRC.  It was open to the FTT  to  make  the  findings
    that it did having regard to the evidence before it.   I  am  satisfied
    that there is no material error of law. Even though the FTT  failed  to
    express the flexibility in the approach to the  standard  of  proof  in
    cases where deception is used, I am satisfied  that  there  would  have
    been no difference to the outcome in the light of  the  findings  made.
    There were suspicions aired in the DVRs that the  sponsor's  employment
    and earnings  were contrived, but the issue before the FTT was  whether
    or not the respondent had shown to the required standard of proof  that
    the payslips relied on by the appellant were false. That was the  basis
    of the refusal decision and not whether the appellant  met  the  income
    threshold or related evidential requirements. The decision and  reasons
    shall stand and the appeal is dismissed.
