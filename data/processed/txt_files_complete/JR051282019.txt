                                  Judgment

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr P  Turner,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  the
Legal Resource Partnership, on behalf of the Applicant and Mr D  Ruck-Keene,
of Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of  the
Respondent, at a hearing at Field House, London on 20 August 2020


Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt:


Introduction


   1. The applicant challenges a decision of the respondent of 5  July  2019
      which was an Administrative Review upholding a decision dated  21  May
      2019 which refused an application for indefinite leave to remain (ILR)
      as a Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) Migrant.


Factual Background


   2. The applicant is a citizen of Nigeria and was born on 3 May 1973.  His
      wife,  and  their  three  minor  children  are   dependents   on   the
      application.


   3. On 28 August 2012 the applicant's wife was granted a visa  as  Tier  4
      (General) student valid until 30 January 2014 and the family  came  to
      the UK with the applicant and the children as dependents.


   4. On 29 January 2014 the applicant applied for further leave  to  remain
      as a Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) Migrant. He was  granted  leave  in
      that category on 13 February 2014  until  16  February  2017  and  the
      family were granted leave as his dependents.


   5. On 8 February 2017 the applicant applied for further leave as a Tier 2
      (Minister of Religion)  Migrant.  That  leave  was  granted  until  18
      February 2019.


   6. On 1 February 2019 the applicant applied for ILR as a Tier 2 (Minister
      of Religion) Migrant.


   7. The applicant's Tier 2 sponsor was City Chapel. On 12 April  2019  the
      respondent revoked City Chapel's sponsor's licence.


   8. On 21 May 2019 the respondent refused the applicant's ILR  application
      with right to Administrative Review. The application  was  refused  as
      City Chapel's licence had been revoked and there was  no  evidence  to
      show that the organisation had made  an  application  to  renew  their
      licence. The application was refused as the applicant did not meet the
      requirements of Paragraph 245HG(c)(i) of the Immigration Rules.


   9. On 7 June 2019 the applicant applied for Administrative Review on  the
      basis that as all requirements were met at the date of application  (1
      February 2019) and/or by 13 February 2019 when he  met  the  5  years'
      continuous residence requirement, otherwise and would cause  detriment
      to the applicant for a reason entirely outside his control,  that  is,
      the revocation of the sponsor's licence.


  10. On 5 July 2019 the respondent upheld  the  decision  of  21  May  2019
      maintaining that it was lawful where the applicant did  not  meet  the
      Immigration Rules at the date of the decision. Further, there had been
      no unnecessary or undue delay in processing the ILR application.


  11. This application was lodged on 4 October 2019. Permission was  refused
      on the papers on 2 December 2019.  The  application  was  renewed  and
      permission to apply for judicial review was granted on 31 January 2020
      after an oral hearing.


  12. The respondent lodged detailed grounds of defence on 22 June 2020. The
      applicant lodged a skeleton argument on 31 July 2020.  The  respondent
      lodged a skeleton argument on  7  August  2020.  The  application  was
      listed for a substantive hearing on  20  August  2020.  The  applicant
      applied on 18 August 2020 to amend his grounds. That  application  was
      refused on 19 August 2020.


Legal and Policy Framework


  13. The paragraphs of the Immigration Rules in question here  state  (with
      my emphasis in bold):


         245HG. Requirements for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 2
         (Minister of Religion) Migrant


         To qualify for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 2 (Minister of
         Religion) Migrant, an applicant must meet the requirements listed
         below. If the applicant meets these requirements, indefinite leave
         to remain will be granted. If the applicant does not meet these
         requirements, the application will be refused.


         Requirements:


          a) The applicant must not fall for refusal under the general
             grounds for refusal, and must not be an illegal entrant.


          b) The applicant must have spent a continuous period of 5 years
             lawfully in the UK, of which the most recent period must have
             been spent with


          c) The Sponsor that issued the Certificate of Sponsorship that
             led to the applicant's last grant of leave must:


             (i)  still hold a Tier 2 Sponsor licence in the relevant
                  category, or have an application for a renewal of such a
                  licence currently under consideration by the Home
                  Office[pic]


  14. The respondent's "Tier 2 Policy Guidance" for applicants states:


         "189. Where your application relies on a Certificate of Sponsorship
         that has been either withdrawn or cancelled, your application  will
         be refused."


  15. The "Tier 2 and 5: Guidance for Sponsors" states (with my emphasis  in
      bold):


         "What happens to my sponsored migrants if my licence is revoked?


      9. If your licence is revoked, any COS you have assigned automatically
         become invalid. This means that any application for entry clearance
         to the UK or leave to remain in the UK made on the basis of the COS
         will automatically be refused.


     10. Where a migrant has already been granted entry clearance to the  UK
         when we revoke your licence, if they have not yet travelled to  the
         UK, their entry clearance will be  cancelled  under  paragraph  30A
         (ii) of the Immigration Rules. If the migrant has travelled to  the
         UK, they will be refused  entry  to  the  country  under  paragraph
         321A(1) of the Immigration Rules.


     11. If your sponsor licence is suspended while we  are  considering  an
         application  for  settlement,  also  called  'indefinite  leave  to
         remain' (ILR), from a Tier 2 or 5 migrant that you are  sponsoring,
         we will not make the decision on their settlement application until
         the outcome of  the  suspension  is  decided.  If  the  licence  is
         revoked, we will then refuse the settlement application."


Discussion


  16. The core challenge here is that the  respondent  acted  unlawfully  in
      refusing the application on 21 May 2019 where it is undisputed that on
      13 February 2019 the applicant could have met the  Immigration  Rules,
      his sponsor's licence only being revoked on 12 April 2019.


  17. It is well understood that the respondent acts  lawfully  in  applying
      the law in force  at  the  date  of  her  decision  and  not  the  law
      pertaining at an earlier date, for example the date of an application.
      This principle was set down by the House of Lords in  Odelola  v  SSHD
      [2009] UKHL 25. It has been approved consistently by the higher courts
      since then. In BB (Algeria) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ  25  at  [32],  for
      example:


         "In Odelola the House of Lords clearly  established  the  principle
         that, absent  an  express  transitional  provision  which  provides
         otherwise, immigration decisions are to be taken by  the  Secretary
         of State in accordance with the Immigration Rules in force  at  the
         time the decision is made."


  18. The Court of Appeal in BB (Algeria) went on in paragraphs 33 to 46  to
      set out equally clearly that as  of  the  date  of  the  decision,  an
      applicant does not retain  "any  kind  of  vested,  or  other,  right"
      arising from the fact that at some earlier point, including  the  date
      of the application, he may have met the Immigration Rules.


  19. Following this principle, the respondent acted  lawfully  in  applying
      the law as it stood at the date of the decision on 21 May 2019.


  20. The applicant seeks to distinguish the principle set  out  in  Odelola
      arguing that it only applies where there has  been  a  change  in  the
      Immigration Rules after an application is made, the  particular  facts
      in Odelola. He maintains that the situation here was different as  the
      Rules at the date of the  application,  during  the  period  that  the
      application was outstanding and at the date of the decision  were  the
      same. I was not taken to anything in Odelola that  suggests  that  the
      principles set out  therein  were  intended  to  be  limited  only  to
      situations where the Immigration Rules changed  after  an  application
      was made and before the respondent makes  a  decision  and  would  not
      applicable here. Indeed, Odelola, and all of the case law that  I  was
      taken to that affirms it, is predicated on the date  of  the  decision
      being the relevant date for the respondent to apply the current law to
      the applicant's circumstances. If that were not so, the  arguments  in
      that line of case law as to what iteration of  the  Immigration  Rules
      should be applied at the date of the decision would not have arisen.


  21. The applicant maintains that the ordinary reading of  paragraph  245HG
      is that ILR should have been granted here as by 13 February  2019  the
      applicant had met the Rule indicated that he  needed  to  do  more  in
      order to be granted ILR, regardless of what  followed  in  the  period
      thereafter prior to the decision actually being made.


  22. That argument does not have merit. The applicant's submission is  that
      the wording of paragraph 245HG is sufficiently clear so as to indicate
      that if the applicant "still" has a sponsor with a Tier 2 licence or a
      sponsor applying for such a licence on the  date  that  the  applicant
      meets the 5 years' continuous residence  requirement,  then,  whatever
      follows, and whatever the circumstances pertain  when  the  respondent
      comes to make a decision, he is still entitled to ILR. In my  judgment
      nothing in the wording of the Rule provides for the  specific  meaning
      argued for the applicant. A great deal would have to be read  into  it
      for that  to  be  so.  There  is  nothing  approaching  the  "express"
      provision referred to in paragraph 32 of BB (Algeria) to allow for the
      interpretation argued for the applicant and for that interpretation to
      have legal force capable of displacing the Odelola principle.


  23. Secondly, it does not, in my view, reflect the ordinary meaning of the
      wording  of  paragraph  245HG  when  construed  against  the  relevant
      background, that is, the Immigration Rules taken as a  whole  and  the
      function they serve in the administration of immigration policy; Mahad
      v ECO [2009] UKSC 16 at [10] applied. The higher courts have confirmed
      consistently that the Points Based System is intended to simplify  the
      procedure for applying for leave in certain classes of case,  such  as
      economic migrants and students, and have recognised that "hard"  cases
      can arise as the price of securing consistency and predictability; see
      EK (Ivory coast) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1517.


  24. The "bright line" provisions of the Tier 2 Migrant  category  and  the
      situation when a sponsor's licence is revoked after an application  is
      made were considered in the case of Pathan  v  SSHD  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
      2103. In that case, it was found that the respondent acted lawfully in
      simply refusing a Tier 2 application where the sponsor's  licence  had
      been revoked after  the  application  for  leave  had  been  made.  As
      indicated by Singh LJ at [73]:


         "[pic] no-one who is given leave as a Tier 2 Migrant can  have  any
         reasonable expectation that they will be  permitted  to  remain  in
         this country if the particular employer who is  their  sponsor  has
         its licence revoked. This is because, as I have already  said,  the
         Tier 2 scheme is closely tied to there being a  particular  vacancy
         in the labour market which cannot otherwise be filled. It is not  a
         general permission to come to this  country  for  the  purposes  of
         work, still less for the purposes of looking for work."


  25. The Court of Appeal also found support for the "bright line" operation
      of the Tier 2 Migrant system in the respondent's guidance  to  Tier  2
      applicants  and  sponsors.  As  shown  in  the  extracts  set  out  in
      paragraphs 14 and 15 above, the guidance informs a  Tier  2  applicant
      and  sponsor  expressly  that  if  the  licence  is  revoked  then  an
      application will be refused. The respondent's "Tier 2 Policy Guidance"
      for applicants at paragraph 189 states that in the circumstances  that
      arose here, the application fell to be refused.  These  paragraphs  in
      the guidance  documents  are  consistent  with  an  interpretation  of
      paragraph 245HG requiring there to be a valid  Tier  2  sponsor  or  a
      sponsor applying for a Tier 2 licence as of the date of the  decision.
      Singh LJ indicated at [72] of Pathan that:


         "I do not consider there to be any unfairness, certainly  not  such
         as to be irrational, in circumstances where fair notice  was  given
         to everyone concerned, including these appellants, that the  regime
         which would apply would be exactly the one  which  was  applied  to
         them. This was made particularly clear in para 190 of the  guidance
         for applicants which I have quoted earlier." [pic]


  26. The applicant seeks to draw a distinction between the  application  in
      Pathan being one for an extension of Tier 2 leave rather than ILR but,
      in my view, the issues  are  the  same.  When  construed  against  the
      purpose of the Points Based System, the ordinary meaning of "still" in
      paragraph 245HG(c)(i) of the Immigration Rules is that a sponsor  must
      still be a valid sponsor at the point  the  decision  is  made  on  an
      application for ILR.


  27. There is a reference in one iteration of the  applicant's  grounds  to
      public law error arising from delay but this was not  pursued  at  the
      hearing. It is sufficient to indicate that where the decision was made
      within 4 months of the application and nothing required the respondent
      to make a decision at any earlier time, any argument on the  basis  of
      delay has no merit; FH and Ors v SSHD [2007] EWHC 157 applied.


  28. It was accepted at the hearing that the application that was  made  to
      the respondent was not an Article 8 ECHR application but only one  for
      ILR under paragraph 245HG of the Immigration Rules. Any arguments  put
      forward on Article 8 ECHR human rights grounds and  referring  to  the
      best interests of the children do not have merit where  no  Article  8
      ECHR application was made. It remains open to the  applicant  to  make
      such an application now to the respondent in the usual manner.  It  is
      at that point that the respondent  can  be  expected  to  address  any
      difficulties concerning the applicant's ability to pay the fee  for  a
      further application.


Conclusion


  29. For these reasons, the application is refused.

Application for judicial review: substantive decision


Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr P  Turner,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  the
Legal Resource Partnership, on behalf of the Applicant and Mr D  Ruck-Keene,
of Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of  the
Respondent, at a hearing at Field House, London on 20 August 2020

Decision


      1. The application for judicial review  is  refused  for  the  reasons
         given in the judgement attached.

Order

      2. The judicial review application is dismissed.




Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal


      3. The applicant provided written grounds dated 21 September  2020  in
         support of an application for permission to appeal to the Court  of
         Appeal.

      4. Paragraph 6 of the grounds is highly misleading. It  seeks  to  re-
         assert that the applicant qualified for indefinite leave to  remain
         (ILR) on 17 January 2019. This was not a point  argued  before  the
         Upper Tribunal.  An application  to  admit  amended  grounds  which
         included this assertion was refused with full reasons  given  in  a
         decision issued on 19 August 2020, the day before the oral  renewal
         hearing.  That  decision  indicated  clearly  that   the   argument
         concerning qualification  for  ILR  on  17  January  2020  was  not
         admitted and was wrong in law in any event.  The  applicant  cannot
         seek to argue the point now  or  rely  on  this  assertion  in  the
         grounds for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

      5. Paragraph 7 of the grounds repeats a speculative argument  that  if
         he had made a premium service application  the  revocation  of  his
         sponsor's licence would not have occurred so  he  would  have  been
         granted ILR. This ignores the basic facts. He  did  not  apply  for
         premium service. It was in no way certain that even had he done  so
         he would have been granted ILR.

      6. The grounds at 14 only seek to re-argue the case  made  before  the
         Upper  Tribunal.  They  make   almost   entirely   unparticularised
         submissions. In 14a., for example, how or where in the judgment did
         the Upper Tribunal misapply the  Immigration  Rules?  Or  in  14c.,
         where in the judgment did the Upper  Tribunal  give  precedence  to
         guidance over the Rules?

      7. The Upper Tribunal applied an ordinary and proper  reading  of  the
         Rules to the facts and was correct to find  that  respondent  acted
         lawfully in applying the law as it  stood  at  the  date  that  the
         decision on  leave  was  made.  The  Upper  Tribunal  addressed  BB
         (Algeria) at [18] and Pathan at [24]-[26]  and  did  so  correctly,
         setting out why they  were  applicable  here.  The  Upper  Tribunal
         considered the allegation of unlawful delay correctly in [27].

      8. For these reasons the application for permission to appeal  to  the
         Court of Appeal does not have merit and is refused.

Costs


      9. The applicant has not been successful and nothing in the  materials
         indicates that he should not be expected to bear  the  respondent's
         reasonable costs.

     10. The applicant will pay the  respondent's  reasonable  costs  to  be
         assessed if not agreed.

     11. This order is  maintained  following  the  applicant's  application
         dated 18 September 2020 for costs to be "reduced and spread out" as
         he is not  "in  a  financially  strong  position."  He  enclosed  a
         schedule of income which showed a  monthly  income  of  �5,632  and
         expenditure of approximately �3,000. These figures do not support a
         claim to be unable to  pay  the  respondent's  costs  where  income
         exceeds outgoings by over �2,000.

       Notification of appeal rights


      A decision by the Upper  Tribunal  on  an  application  for  judicial
      review is a decision that disposes of proceedings.


       A party may appeal against such a decision to the Court of Appeal on
      a question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply
      to the Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the
      decision is given. If no  application  is  made,  the  Tribunal  must
      nonetheless consider  at  the  hearing  whether  to  give  or  refuse
      permission to appeal (rule 44(4B) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008).


      If  the  Tribunal  refuses  permission,  either  in  response  to  an
      application or by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the  party  wishing  to
      appeal can apply for permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This
      must be done by filing an appellant's notice with the  Civil  Appeals
      Office of the Court  of  Appeal  within  28  days  of  the  date  the
      Tribunal's decision on permission to appeal was sent (Civil Procedure
      Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
