Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Briddock, Counsel instructed by M & K
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION
Background

     1. By a decision promulgated on 11 July 2018, I found an error of  law
        in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Gribble dismissing the
        Appellant's appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decision  dated  25
        February 2016 refusing  him  a  residence  card  on  the  basis  of
        retained rights of residence  as  the  former  family  member  (ex-
        spouse) of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in  the  UK.  I
        set  aside  that  decision  and  gave  directions  to  re-make  the
        decision.  My error of law decision is appended  to  this  decision
        for ease of reference.

     2. The Appellant's immigration history is amply set out at [2] to  [4]
        of my earlier decision and I do  not  need  to  repeat  that.   The
        salient dates in relation to the issues which I have to decide  are
        the date of the Appellant's marriage to his Latvian spouse, Ms [F],
        which took place on 25 July 2010 and the date of his  divorce  from
        her.  In that regard, the decree nisi was pronounced on 5  December
        2013 and was made absolute on 6 March 2014.  I will  also  need  to
        deal with the dates when  the  couple  lived  together  at  various
        addresses and their employment history,  but  I  will  do  so  when
        considering the evidence below.

     3. I referred  in  my  earlier  decision  to  two  earlier  First-tier
        Tribunal decisions made on 20 September 2012  and  30  March  2015.
        However, for the reasons given  at  [20]  to  [24]  of  my  earlier
        decision, I do not take those decisions as my starting point as the
        earlier findings were not concerned with the issues which I have to
        determine. I will refer  to  them,  however,  as  appropriate  when
        dealing with the facts of the case.

   The Legal Framework and Issues

     4. Turning then  to  the  issues  for  me  to  decide  and  the  legal
        framework, the parties are  agreed  that  the  relevant  applicable
        regulations  are   The   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
        Regulations 2006 ("the Regulations").  The relevant  provisions  of
        the Regulations are regulations 10 (in relation to retained  rights
        of residence) and 15 (permanent right of residence).  Those read as
        follows (so far as relevant):



           Regulation 10

           "Family member who has retained the right of residence"

           10.- (1) In these Regulations, "family member who has retained
           the right of residence" means, subject to paragraph (8), a
           person who satisfies the conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4)
           or (5).

           ...

           (5) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-

           (a) he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person or of
           an EEA national with a permanent right of residence on the
           termination of the marriage or civil partnership of that person;



           (b)he was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with
           these Regulations at the date of the termination;

           (c)he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and

           (d)either-

           (i)prior to the initiation of the proceedings for the
           termination of the marriage or the civil partnership the
           marriage or civil partnership had lasted for at least three
           years and the parties to the marriage or civil partnership had
           resided in the United Kingdom for at least one year during its
           duration;

           (ii) ....

           (6) The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

           (a) is not an EEA national but would, if he were an EEA
           national, be a worker, a self-employed person or a self-
           sufficient person under regulation 6; or

           (b)is the family member of a person who falls within paragraph
        (a).

           ....

           (8)  A person with a permanent right of residence under
           regulation 15 shall not become a family member who has retained
           the right of residence on the death or departure from the United
           Kingdom of the qualified person or the EEA national with a
           permanent right of residence or the termination of the marriage
           or civil partnership, as the case may be, and a family member
           who has retained the right of residence shall cease to have that
           status on acquiring a permanent right of residence under
           regulation 15."

           Regulation 15

           "Permanent right of residence
           15.-(1) The following persons shall acquire the right to reside
           in the United Kingdom permanently-
           (a) ....;
           (b) a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an EEA
           national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the EEA
           national in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous
           period of five years;
           ...
           (f)a person who-
           (i)has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with these
           Regulations for a continuous period of five years; and
           (ii)was, at the end of that period, a family member who has
           retained the right of residence.
           ...."

     5. The Respondent accepts in his decision letter that the  Appellant's
        marriage to Ms [F] subsisted  for  at  least  three  years  (as  is
        evident from the chronology at [2] above).  However, the Respondent
        did not accept that the marriage was a genuine one and he  asserted
        that the marriage was one of convenience.  In addition,  issue  was
        taken whether Ms [F] was exercising Treaty rights at  the  relevant
        times and whether the Appellant was himself economically active  as
        if he were an EEA national during the relevant  periods.   Although
        Mr Duffy accepted in oral submissions that the evidence as  to  the
        employment activity of  Ms  [F]  and  the  Appellant  is  now  more
        complete, he continued to argue that their earnings were such  that
        any such activity was marginal and ancillary so  that  it  did  not
        amount to genuine economic activity and  that  the  evidence  still
        does not show that they meet the relevant criteria.

     6. In relation to the  genuineness  of  their  economic  activity,  Mr
        Briddock reminded me that the genuineness of economic  activity  is
        not dictated by the level of earnings.  I refer to what was said by
        this Tribunal in the  case  of  Begum  (EEA-  worker  -  jobseeker)
        Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00275 (IAC), the headnote to  which  reads  as
        follows (so far as relevant):


           "(1)   When deciding whether an EEA national is a worker for the
           purposes of the EEA Regulations, regard must be had to the  fact
           that the term  has  a  meaning  in  EU  law,  that  it  must  be
           interpreted broadly and that it is not conditioned by  the  type
           of employment or the amount of income derived.  But a person who
           does not pursue effective and  genuine  activities,  or  pursues
           activities on such a small scale as to  be  regarded  as  purely
           marginal and ancillary or which have no  economic  value  to  an
           employer, is not a worker.  In  this  context,  regard  must  be
           given to the nature  of  the  employment  relationship  and  the
           rights and duties of the person  concerned  to  decide  if  work
           activities are effective and genuine...."


        I will consider the evidence as to economic activity below.

     7. I set out the case law relevant to  the  burdens  and  standard  of
        proof in relation to  the  issue  whether  a  marriage  is  one  of
        convenience at [15] to [16] of my earlier decision  and  I  do  not
        need to repeat  that.   As  Mr  Briddock  submitted  and  Mr  Duffy
        accepted, the legal position is that  the  Respondent  retains  the
        legal burden of proof throughout to establish that the marriage  is
        one of convenience.  At highest,  if  the  Respondent  is  able  to
        establish  a  prima  facie  case  that  the  marriage  is  one   of
        convenience, the Appellant has an evidential burden to  respond  to
        the doubts raised.

   The Respondent's Case

     8. Turning then to the  Respondent's  reasons  for  finding  that  the
        marriage was one of convenience, those are set out at page [2/4] of
        the decision letter as follows:

           "...Furthermore, you were invited to attend an interview at  our
           offices in Liverpool on 12th January 2016.  The purpose  of  the
           interview was to verify the genuine nature of your  marriage  to
           your EEA sponsor when it subsisted.

           During the interview you were asked various questions about your
           EEA sponsor and your marriage.  You were asked  about  your  EEA
           sponsors work and stated that when you met, your EEA sponsor was
           working as a cleaner.  You stated at the point of  your  divorce
           your EEA sponsor was a cleaner at Alfa Rose Kebabish  Restaurant
           and could be called anytime to clean between 11am and 11pm.  The
           interviewer  found  that  you  were  evasive  when  it  came  to
           answering questions in more details.  We do not find it credible
           that your EEA sponsor would just be called into  clean  whenever
           and would not have a set shift pattern or working hours.

           You had previously been invited on two occasions  to  attend  an
           interview when you submitted an application  in  2013  based  on
           your marriage to your EEA sponsor.  You failed to attend on both
           occasions and failed to provide any compelling reason as to  why
           you did not attend.  You  stated  to  the  interviewer  on  this
           occasion that you did not attend due to depression but you  have
           never provided any medical evidence of this.  You did not inform
           the Home Office that in September 2013 your marriage to your EEA
           sponsor  had  broken  down,  and  instead  continued  with  your
           application and subsequent appeal based on  the  fact  that  you
           were in a relationship with your EEA sponsor.

           You have previously made applications for a residence card based
           on your  relationship  to  your  EEA  sponsor  however  on  each
           occasion these were refused as you failed to provide  sufficient
           evidence relation to your EEA sponsors treaty rights.

           Due to the evidence above we  have  doubts  as  to  whether  the
           marriage between you and your EEA sponsor was  genuine  when  it
           subsisted."

     9. The interview record runs to some twenty-four pages.  The Appellant
        was asked a number of questions about his  relationship,  including
        Ms [F]'s background and family circumstances, when they  met,  when
        they started living together and where,  the  wedding  arrangements
        and the divorce.   No issue is taken with the  Appellant's  answers
        to those questions.  Of course, by the time of the interview, on 12
        January 2016, the  Appellant  was  already  divorced  and,  on  his
        account, no longer in contact with Ms [F] so that she could not  be
        interviewed.

    10. The relevant exchange between the interviewer and the Appellant  on
        which the Respondent relies is as follows:

           "Interviewer:     How many hours of work did your ex wife  work,
                        how many hours did she work at the ...as a cleaner?
                        Wat that her only job in the restaurant, or did she
                        work elsewhere as well?


           Applicant:  No, just for work last (inaudible)


           Interviewer:      So what were  her  hours  of  work?  How  long
                        did...What time did she start work  and  what  time
                        did she finish work?


           Applicant:  It different times when they calling, but it's  less
                        than 20 hours.


           Interviewer:      So what time did she start work?


           Applicant:  It's different times.


           Interviewer:      When you say different times, what do you mean
                        by that?


           Applicant:  When they calling, when they calling.


           Interviewer:      What times of day would they call?


           Applicant:  They start 11, 11 to 9, 10, no it's 11am to 11pm


           Interviewer:      She would be called anytime from 11am to 11pm?


           Applicant:  Yes, anytime, yes.


           Interviewer:      But if she's working in a  restaurant,  surely
                        they don't  want  her  cleaning  when  they've  got
                        customers in that restaurant, so what  times  would
                        she go to clean?


           Applicant:  It's not exactly time, I told you it's  not  exactly
                        time, it's different times.


           Interviewer:      What time did she normally go to work?


           Applicant:  It's not different time, it's four times...


           Interviewer:      So you don't know what time  your  wife  would
                        usually go out to work?


           Applicant:  No, I know, but sometimes I'm going to  my  job  and
                        she's going there. I  told  you  in  between  times
                        she's going.


           Interviewer:      So it's a restaurant, is it a restaurant  that
                        has customers sitting down in? Is  this  restaurant
                        has customers sitting down?


           Applicant:  Yeah.


           Interviewer:      So she's a cleaner, OK, so surely she would go
                        before they opened or when they finished,  so  when
                        did she go?


           Applicant:  Most of the time, sometimes before starting.


           Interviewer:      So what time would the restaurant open?


           Applicant:  I think they open at 10 to 11, yeah, this time.


           Interviewer:      They opened at 10 o'clock in the morning?


           Applicant:  Yeah. But that's different timing every day.


           Interviewer:      So she'd clean while there were  customers  in
                        the restaurant?


           Applicant:  She's cleaning, it's a cleaning job.


           Interviewer:      She would clean while there were customers  in
                        the restaurant? Did she clean out in the restaurant
                        or did she clean kitchen, toilets,  where  did  she
                        clean?


           Applicant:  I don't know  what  she  doing  there,  but  she  is
                        working there as a cleaning, yeah."


    11. The  Appellant  was  invited  to  interview  with  Ms  [F]  on  two
        occasions, in August and September  2013,  in  connection  with  an
        earlier application made on 3 April  2013  for  a  residence  card.
        They failed to attend.   The Appellant was asked about this and the
        breakdown of their marriage at the interview in January 2016 in the
        following exchange:

           "Interviewer:     So tell me about  your  application  in  2013.
                        You were asked to attend an interview  like  you're
                        in an interview today, why didn't you and your wife
                        attend the interview?


           Applicant:  In 2013?


           Interviewer:      Yes, in 2013.


           Applicant:  Because basically at this moment, at that time it's,
                        we are,  I  think  I  told  you,  [inaudible]  it's
                        basically that times I'm too much disturbed and I'm
                        medical unfit, yeah, last time, that's the reason I
                        did not come on the interview.  We give our medical
                        certificate for the doctor, we sent it.


           Interviewer:      Yes. But, OK.  So, OK, so you  were  medically
                        unfit at that time. What was wrong with you?


           Applicant:  Too much stress and tension and stress,  yeah.   I'm
                        still on occasions have stress today because  I  am
                        completing the tablets and everything because  last
                        three, four years.


           Interviewer:      We received confirmation from  you  in  August
                        2013 to say that you could not attend the  marriage
                        interview due to medical reasons.


           Applicant:  Yes, yes.


           Interviewer:       You  were  then  asked  to  attend  a  second
                        interview in..OK, let  me  check...You  were  asked
                        then  to  attend  a  marriage  interview   on   2nd
                        September, sorry, on 3rd September 2013,  OK.   Why
                        didn't you attend for that one?


           Applicant:  Because I'm sick.


           Interviewer:      You were sick as well for that one?


           Applicant:  Yeah, I'm still using my  medicine,  in  my  pocket,
                        yeah.


           Interviewer:      So you've not  attended  because  for  medical
                        reasons.


           Applicant:  Yes, yes.


           Interviewer:      You've said to me that you started having,  so
                        in September 2013, you moved out of the address.


           Applicant:  Yes


           Interviewer:      So why did you not inform the Home  Office  of
                        your problems with your marriage at that time?


           Applicant:  My marriage, my marriage continue, always continue.


           Interviewer:      OK, but you moved  out  of  your  property  in
                        September 2013.


           Applicant:  Yes


           Interviewer:      Why did you not inform the  Home  Office  that
                        you were having problems in your marriage and  that
                        you had moved, that you have moved out of your home
                        with your wife? Why did you not inform us?


           Applicant:  It's, it's a medical problem.


           Interviewer:


           Representative:   No, no, no. The lady's asking you,  you  moved
                        out from your house, you left your wife  there  and
                        you moved out in 2013, September.  Why  didn't  you
                        tell the Home Office?


           Interviewer:


           Applicant:  OK, OK, yeah.  It's out case  is  already  in  court
                        [phonetic] in between time, in between our case  is
                        already in court at that time, yeah.


           Interviewer:      Yes it's in the Home Office, but at  no  point
                        have you said at that time that you've moved out of
                        your house to us and that you were having  problems
                        with your marriage in 2013.


           Applicant:  No it's basically at that moment we are, our case is
                        in Home...[inaudible] in court.


           Interviewer:      But you didn't inform us, we've requested  you
                        to come to an  interview,  you  didn't  attend  the
                        interview  because  you  said   you   had   medical
                        problems.  However, you did not tell  us  that  you
                        were having problems in your marriage at that time.


           Applicant:  It's basically, I told you in the  medical  stuff  I
                        send you.


           Interviewer:      But you did not tell us that you  were  having
                        problems in your marriage at that  time.   Why  did
                        you not tell us? Why did you not inform us?


           Applicant:  I told you at the moment because our case is already
                        done in the course.


           Interviewer:      The application was going through, however  at
                        no point did you tell that you were having marriage
                        difficulties. Why did you not tell us?


           Applicant:  This is a nature, this is a nature, a human body, if
                        we have some problem in life,  in  couple,  in  the
                        home, we want to try to solve this problem, we want
                        to try.


           Interviewer:      But you left in September 2013.


           Applicant:  Yes.


           Interviewer:      You left your marital home in September  2013,
                        in September 2013, you were requested to  attend  a
                        marriage  interview  with  your  wife.   So  at  no
                        point...you did not attend that interview and at no
                        point after that, after September, did you tell  us
                        that you had separated from your wife.


           Applicant:  Not separated, we start the separation probably.


           Interviewer:      You had left the marital home.   At  no  point
                        did you inform us, why was this?


           Applicant:  I informed my solicitors everything, I ...


           Interviewer:      Your solicitors did not inform us, OK, so  why
                        did...the onus isn't just on  yourself,  it  is  on
                        your...the onus isn't just on your solicitor, it is
                        also on yourself to inform us that...of any changes
                        in your circumstances.


           Applicant:  How can I tell you because it's our case is  already
                        in court.  We are running our case in court.


           Interviewer:      It wasn't in  Sept...it  wasn't  in  September
                        when you split, when you separated from your  wife.
                        So...


           Applicant:  No. It's basically it's our case is all in court, we
                        are fighting our case, at that times.


           Interviewer:      So why didn't you tell us that your  wife  and
                        yourself had separated?  Why did you not  tell  the
                        courts?  Why did you not inform anyone?


           Applicant:  We told the courts everything when we went to there,
                        the court everything, we told them  medical  stuff,
                        we showed them absolute decree, we...


           Interviewer:      Did you tell them that you had separated?


           Applicant:  Who, for who?


           Interviewer:      Did you tell anybody in September that you had
                        separated?  Did  you  tell  the  Home  Office,  the
                        courts, anybody that you had separated, that  there
                        had been a change of circumstances?


           Applicant:  No, we,  we,  just  start  in  September  in  mutual
                        understanding, but we do the same  papers  then  in
                        March 2014.


           Interviewer:      Yes.


           Applicant:  We are case, we are fighting case in court.


           Interviewer:      Yes but at no point did you say to us that you
                        have separated.  Did you... Why was this?


           Applicant:  Because we [inaudible] at the moment is at court.


           Interviewer:      But you're missing the point here, is that you
                        didn't tell us that you were separated, so then you
                        could've got, if you had  separated,  you  could've
                        then  maybe  looked  at  a   different,   different
                        application at that time, why did you not tell us?


           Applicant:  How can I showed you  at  the  moment  because  it's
                        already we are fighting case in court,  because  we
                        showing   the   court   everything,   we    telling
                        everything, before this situation  and  after  with
                        the situation."


    12. The application made on  3  April  2013  was  not  refused  by  the
        Respondent until 1 October 2013.  It was refused on the basis  that
        the Appellant had not shown  that  Ms  [F]  was  exercising  Treaty
        rights.  The Respondent noted that  the  company  which  owned  the
        restaurant for which she was said to be  working  had  applied  for
        voluntary  strike  off  on  20  August  2013  and  that  there  was
        insufficient evidence of her working prior to that date and at  the
        date of application.  In addition, the Respondent  did  not  accept
        that the relationship was genuine and subsisting.  That  was  based
        in part on the earlier First-tier Tribunal decision  but  also  the
        failure to attend the interviews in August and September 2013.  The
        Respondent did not however go so far as to assert that the marriage
        was one of convenience from the outset.  Of  course,  however,  the
        Respondent  had  not  at  that  time  been  made  aware  that   the
        relationship had broken down.

    13. The Appellant appealed the refusal of 1 October 2013  which  appeal
        culminated in the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lloyd
        promulgated on 30 March 2015.  As is noted at [6] of  the  decision
        of First-tier Tribunal Judge Gribble, Judge Lloyd was not satisfied
        that Ms [F] was a qualified person at the time of  the  termination
        of the marriage.  Judge Lloyd was however, provided  with  evidence
        that the marriage was by that time at an end and did not  make  any
        findings about the genuineness of the relationship as a result (see
        also what I say at [22] of my earlier decision about the extent  of
        the finding made earlier by Judge James about the relationship).

    14. I will come on to consider the  Respondent's  reasons  for  refusal
        after I have set out the Appellant's evidence in  response  to  the
        Respondent's case.







   The Appellant's Evidence

    15. The Appellant produced the bundle of documents  which  were  before
        Judge Gribble (hereafter referred to as [AB/xx].  In  addition,  in
        response to my earlier decision and directions, the Appellant filed
        a supplementary bundle  of  documents  (hereafter  referred  to  as
        [ABS/xx].  Mr Duffy did not  have  a  copy  of  that  supplementary
        bundle so one was provided to him at the hearing and he was given a
        short time to read it.

    16. I also received oral evidence from the  Appellant  and  four  other
        witnesses.  Notwithstanding the very clear direction in my  earlier
        decision that the Tribunal should be informed if an interpreter was
        required, none was requested.  I was told that the Appellant  would
        have preferred to give evidence via an interpreter but  since  none
        was requested and in order to avoid an adjournment, he was  content
        to give evidence in English.  The Appellant came to the UK in  2007
        and has studied here.  I was therefore satisfied that he  ought  to
        be able to proceed with his evidence in English.  He was told  that
        if he did not understand a question and needed it to be repeated or
        re-phrased, he should ask and that questions would be asked  slowly
        to ensure he was not in any way  disadvantaged.   I  was  satisfied
        that he understood the questions asked  of  him  and  was  able  to
        convey what he meant by his answers in English.

    17. I begin with the evidence as to  the  nature  of  the  relationship
        between the Appellant and Ms [F].  The  Appellant  has  provided  a
        detailed statement which appears at [AB/32-38].  The Appellant says
        that they met in Luton in 2009 and started to live together at  [~]
        St Mildreds Avenue from early 2010.  They  married  in  a  registry
        office on 25 July 2010.   There  are  photographs  of  the  wedding
        ceremony and reception.  At [AB/71-73] is a tenancy agreement dated
        1 March 2011 for one year  of  the  property  at  [~]  St  Mildreds
        Avenue.  The property is described as  "one  bedroom  with  setting
        [sic] room".  There are a few bills relating to a TV  licence  sent
        individually to the Appellant and Ms [F].  There  is  some  overlap
        between those.  For example, the documents at [AB/74]  and  [AB/79]
        suggest that the Appellant was paying for the TV licence which  was
        in the name of Ms [F].  There are no bills issued to them in  joint
        names. There is no earlier  tenancy  agreement  showing  that  they
        moved into the property at any earlier date.  There is no  evidence
        from the landlord of that property.

    18. The Appellant corrected his statement in oral  evidence  concerning
        the date when they moved address to [~] Freeman Court.  He says  at
        [5] of his statement that he and Ms [F] moved there in  2013.  They
        moved in with Ms Claire Langley who is the wife of a friend of  the
        Appellant who died in Pakistan,  he  says,  in  October  2013.   He
        confirmed though that this was  an  error  in  year  and  that  the
        statement should read that his friend died in Pakistan  in  October
        2012.  That is consistent with Ms Langley's  letter  at  [AB/53-54]
        which letter is dated  1  July  2014.   The  dates  are  also  then
        consistent with the Appellant's evidence that the move followed the
        death of his friend which could not be  the  case  if  he  died  in
        October 2013 as the Appellant's  case  is  that  he  moved  out  of
        Freeman Court in September 2013 when the marriage broke down.

    19. Ms Langley's letter confirms that the Appellant and  Ms  [F]  lived
        with her for almost a year and that the Appellant  moved  out  when
        the couple separated in September  2013.   She  says  that  Ms  [F]
        remained at that address until December 2013.  I note that this  is
        inconsistent with other  documents  in  the  bundle,  such  as  the
        witness statement from HMRC at [AB/110-112] which  gives  Ms  [F]'s
        address held as [~] Freeman Court.  That is  consistent  also  with
        other documents in the bundle addressed to Ms [F] from  HMRC  being
        sent  to  that  address  after  December  2013.  There  is  also  a
        discrepancy in this regard in relation to the  evidence  concerning
        the Appellant as a letter from his accountants dated 22 March  2017
        at [AB/141] also refers to [~] Freeman Court as his address.   This
        may be an  error  by  the  accountants,  however,  since  the  same
        accountants have provided what the Appellant says  is  his  correct
        address in  a  letter  dated  9  September  2015  ([AB/142]).   The
        documents relating  to  Ms  [F]  are  more  difficult  to  explain.
        However, the content of the HMRC statement refers (as at 10 October
        2017) to having records of  employment  only  to  2013-14.   It  is
        therefore plausible that, since there  have  been  no  tax  returns
        filed or PAYE paid since 31 March 2014, HMRC would have no updating
        address.

    20. Although Ms Langley refers to Ms [F] as the Appellant's wife and to
        them moving in with her together  and  thereafter  separating,  the
        letter written by Ms Langley says nothing about the nature  of  the
        relationship.  As Mr Briddock pointed  out,  the  letter  is  dated
        prior to the Respondent's decision  under  appeal  challenging  the
        genuineness of the relationship prior to the separation.   However,
        I note that it post-dates  the  earlier  decision  of  Judge  James
        which, whilst not finding that the marriage was one of convenience,
        had cast some doubt about whether the relationship was genuine  and
        subsisting in 2012.

    21. Ms Langley has not provided any subsequent statement  and  was  not
        called to give evidence.  She is said to have  lived  in  the  same
        property as the Appellant and  Ms  [F]  and  that  is  therefore  a
        surprising  omission  in  the  evidence.   However,  the  Appellant
        explained that Ms  Langley  has  since  re-married,  that  her  new
        husband does not like her continuing  contact  with  the  Appellant
        and, as a result,  he  has  lost  contact.   That  is  a  plausible
        explanation for the omission.

    22. There is a  discrepancy  in  the  documentary  evidence  between  a
        Council tax bill naming the Appellant alongside Ms Langley  and  Ms
        [F] as occupying [~] Freeman Court as at 28  March  2013  ([AB/86])
        and a P45 issued by Euro 1 Stop Cash & Carry dated 1  October  2013
        which gives the Appellant's address as St Mildred's Avenue.   After
        a short exchange during his oral evidence, the Appellant  confirmed
        that the address  held  by  his  former  employer  must  have  been
        incorrect at the time.  It is  plausible  that  the  Appellant  had
        either failed to change his address with his employer when he moved
        or that his employer simply provided a wrong address.

    23. There are four witness statements from friends in  the  Appellant's
        bundle and supplementary bundle and a number of letters from  other
        individuals which, as with  Ms  Langley's  letter,  contain  little
        evidence of the nature of the relationship.  I heard oral  evidence
        from Mr Mahzar Abbass, Mr Mohammad Sarwar, Mr M  Choudhury  and  Mr
        Zahoor Sharif.

    24. Mr Abbass knew the Appellant  when  he  lived  in  Luton.   He  has
        provided a statement which appears at [AB/39-40].   He  says  that,
        when the Appellant and Ms [F] lived together  in  Luton,  he  would
        "often" visit them and they would also come to his  home.   He  did
        not provide evidence about the number of such occasions.   He  says
        that he "always saw them like a genuine loving couple"  and  "never
        had any doubts about their relationship and marriage".  When he was
        asked on what that opinion was based, he said that he saw them  out
        shopping and generally out and about together.  They looked out for
        each other and held hands.  He also said that  he  socialised  with
        them sometimes as the Appellant was a work colleague.  Mr Abbass is
        a married man and considered the Appellant's relationship  with  Ms
        [F] to be similar to his own relationship.

    25. Mr Sarwar has known the Appellant since before he came to  the  UK.
        He also said in oral evidence that the Appellant is his  uncle  and
        that they re-established contact when the Appellant came to the UK.
         Mr Sarwar says in his  statement  ([AB/42-43])  that  he  saw  the
        Appellant with Ms [F] on "multiple occasions" when  they  lived  in
        Luton.  However, when asked how many times, he said only "more than
        a couple".  He pointed out  that  they  lived  in  Luton  and  then
        Wellingborough and he lives in High Wycombe.  He said however  that
        he saw them as a "normal couple" and "did not observe anything  out
        of the ordinary".  In oral evidence, he said  they  were  a  loving
        couple.  He became aware of problems in the marriage after 2010  as
        the Appellant had confided in him but the Appellant was  trying  to
        resolve those problems.  That  is  incidentally  inconsistent  with
        what the Appellant said in oral evidence  that  the  problems  only
        occurred in September 2013 when they separated although  consistent
        with what the Appellant said in interview  in  January  2016  that,
        after one year of marriage,  his  wife  started  going  out  a  lot
        drinking and  that  is  when  the  problems  started  [G18  of  the
        Respondent's bundle] and what is said at [6] to [7] of his  written
        statement.

    26. Mr Choudhury is the owner of Akash  Tandoori  Restaurant.   He  has
        written a letter dated 16  July  2014  which  appears  at  [AB/52].
        There is no witness statement from him. He says that he met Ms  [F]
        a few times as a customer in his restaurant when she was  with  the
        Appellant.  He did  so  on  "two  to  three  times  maximum".   The
        Appellant had introduced her as his wife.  He also expanded on that
        evidence and said that they had a "few parties" in his restaurants.
         He thought that one "was to do with their marriage".

    27. Mr Sharif provided a witness statement most recently  on  6  August
        2018 which appears at [ABS/1-2].  He says that he met Ms [F]  first
        in 2011 in Luton town centre when he was introduced to her  as  the
        Appellant's wife.  Thereafter, he visited them at home  from  "time
        to time" and he saw Ms [F] living with the Appellant.  He says that
        "to the best of [his] knowledge" the couple were "genuinely married
        and living together as husband and wife".   He  was  "content  that
        there is nothing non-genuine about  their  relationship".   In  his
        oral evidence, Mr Sharif said that he  visited  the  couple  a  few
        times per month.  They were living together like a  normal  couple,
        socialised like a normal couple, went shopping together  and  acted
        like a  "normal  happy  couple".   He  did  add  that  "after  what
        happened" he "didn't know about them".  He did go on to say  though
        that he is a married man and the Appellant's relationship was  like
        his own.

    28. The Appellant deals in his witness statement with the  reasons  why
        he did not attend the interviews in August and September  2013  and
        why he did not inform the Home Office of his marriage breakdown  as
        follows:

           "[23] The Home Office  also  state  that  I  have  not  attended
           previous interviews that I was invited to on  two  occasions  in
           support of my applications based on my marriage to my EEA  wife.
           The Home Office state that my explanation for not attending  due
           to my medical issues namely, depression is not accepted as I did
           not provide any medical evidence  of  this.   I  would  like  to
           mention that the Home Office have always been aware that due  to
           my medical circumstances due to which I have not  been  able  to
           attend the interviews which  they  previously  invited  to.   As
           explained I suffered a lot mentally due to my marital breakdown.
            I suffered from depression  and  took  medication  to  help  me
           during 2012 and 2014.  I was stressed due to my wife's behaviour
           and trying to complete my studies.  Everything got on top of  me
           and I couldn't  cope  so  I  went  to  my  doctor  who  gave  me
           medication to help me.

           [24]  The Home Office also states in September 2013, I  did  not
           inform the Home Office that my marriage to my  EEA  Sponsor  had
           broken down  and  instead  continued  with  my  application  and
           subsequent appeal that was based on the fact that  I  was  in  a
           relationship with my EEA Sponsor.  I would like to explain  that
           I didn't think that the start of this separation that I  had  to
           notify the Home Office about immediately as I did mention it  to
           my solicitor but was we had an ongoing case, I didn't  tell  the
           Home Office about my marital problems as these things are common
           in life but it does  not  mean  that  a  separation  has  to  be
           permanent."

    29. Mr Briddock confirmed that there was no medical evidence in support
        of the Appellant's depression but pointed out that the extract from
        the interview which I have set out at [11] above, does confirm that
        some medical evidence had been  provided  to  the  Home  Office  to
        explain the Appellant's failure to attend interview in August 2013.
         He submitted that  it  was  not  implausible  that  mental  health
        problems would be exacerbated  by  the  separation  and  subsequent
        divorce and that this was good reason for the  Appellant's  failure
        to attend both interviews.

    30. The difficulty with that submission  is  that,  although  the  Home
        Office interviewer accepts that there was something which suggested
        that there were medical  reasons  for  the  non-attendance  at  the
        August interview, it is not said what those reasons were and  there
        is no detail in the Appellant's statement as to the nature  of  any
        mental health condition nor any supporting evidence to  corroborate
        the timing and extent of any such condition.  I am not satisfied on
        the evidence that the Appellant was suffering health problems which
        prevented his attendance at the  interviews  in  August/  September
        2013. I think it more likely,  particularly  given  the  timing  of
        those interviews, that the Appellant did not attend as his marriage
        was breaking down at that time and he either thought or  knew  that
        Ms [F] would not support his application.

    31. I accept however Mr Briddock's submission that  the  Appellant  was
        not obliged to tell the Home Office that his marriage either was in
        the process of or already had broken down.  As he pointed out, this
        is not a right to remain under  the  Immigration  Rules  where  the
        breakdown of the marriage would bring  to  an  end  that  right  to
        remain and ought to be notified to the Home Office.  Until the date
        of the  termination  of  the  marriage,  the  Appellant  was  still
        entitled to exercise his rights as the  family  member  of  an  EEA
        national (provided Ms [F] was still exercising her  Treaty  rights)
        and then and thereafter was entitled to rely on retained rights  of
        residence if he is able to establish that he meets the criteria.

    32. I deal finally with what the evidence shows about the  exercise  of
        Treaty rights by Ms [F] and the Appellant.

    33. I begin with Ms [F].  The Appellant is no longer  in  contact  with
        her and therefore I accept that his access to documents  concerning
        her employment is more limited.

    34. The  Appellant's  bundle  includes  at  [AB/98-105]  the  following
        evidence:

        2010/11  self-assessment  tax  calculation:   profit   from   self-
        employment shown as �15,802.  That is  inconsistent  with  the  tax
        calculation provided by HMRC at [AB/103] which  shows  profit  from
        self-employment as only �5,114.  It is however consistent with  the
        tax calculation at [AB/98] which shows tax due of �2,672.36.  Those
        discrepancies are largely irrelevant to the issue which I  have  to
        decide. It may be that the discrepancy  is  explained  by  earnings
        from paid employment in addition to self-employment.

        2011/12 tax  calculation:  profit  from  self-employment  shown  as
        �5,477

        2013/14 tax  calculation:  profit  from  self-employment  shown  as
        �6,864

    35. In addition to those documents, HMRC has provided  a  statement  at
        [AB/110-112] to which I have already referred  at  [19]  above  (in
        relation to  Ms  [F]'s  address).   That  statement  confirms  that
        returns were filed  for  2010-11,  2011-12  and  2013-14  and  that
        taxable profits were as I  have  indicated  above.    There  is  no
        evidence of any earnings at all for 2012-13.

    36. The only other documents relating to Ms Filinova's  employment  are
        at [AB/91-96] which are a letter and payslips issued by  Al  Fairoz
        Kebabish Northampton.  Those indicate that Ms [F] worked  for  that
        organisation to May 2014.  The payslips cover  the  period  October
        2013 to February 2014 and show earnings of �620 per month  paid  in
        cash.  The name of that  restaurant  is  consistent  (phonetically)
        with the name of Ms  [F]'s  employer  given  by  the  Appellant  at
        interview in January 2016.  I  assume  that  it  is  not  the  same
        employer as the one for whom Ms [F] was said to be working when the
        2013 application was made, particularly since the  decision  letter
        in that case asserted that the employer for whom Ms [F] was said to
        be working had applied for  voluntary  strike-off.   That  evidence
        does not therefore show that Ms [F] was working from 2012-13.   The
        earnings level though is  consistent  with  Ms  [F]  having  worked
        throughout most of 2013-14 (by reference to the tax calculation for
        that year).

    37. In relation to the  Appellant  himself,  Mr  Briddock  directed  my
        attention to the evidence at [AB/122-292] and [ABS/4-36]  which  he
        said  showed  that  the  Appellant  has  been  economically  active
        throughout the relevant periods.  He also drew my attention to [19]
        and [20] of the Appellant's statement which he said summarised what
        the documents show.  I deal  with  the  evidence  in  chronological
        order.

    38. There is a letter from HMRC dated 27 August 2015  ([AB/123])  which
        confirms that the Appellant was working for  Euro  1  Stop  Cash  &
        Carry from 1 August 2011 to  28  September  2013.   There  is  also
        evidence (which is not relevant to the issues  I  have  to  decide)
        that he worked for that company in 2007-2009 ([AB/144-145]).   From
        his employment with that company, the Appellant  earned  �3,385  in
        the tax year 2011-12, �5,853 in the tax year 2012-13, and �2,414 in
        the tax year to 5 April 2014.

    39. The Appellant also declared self-employed profits of �3,120 for the
        tax year 2013-14 ([AB/195]). In the tax year 2014-15, the Appellant
        declared self-employed profits of �8,705  ([AB/180]).  In  the  tax
        year 2015-16,  the  Appellant  declared  self-employed  profits  of
        �3,102 ([AB/216]).  There is no tax return for 2016-17 (which would
        be due to be filed by end January 2018).

    40. The Appellant worked for Al-Hamra Supermarket from 23 January  2017
        (confirmed by letter at [AB/125]) earning �172.80  per  week.   The
        P60 at [AB/140] indicates that he earned �1,735.20 for the tax year
        to 5 April 2017 (which is consistent  with  earnings  from  January
        2017 to the end of that tax year).  A  P60  at  [ABS/26]  indicates
        that he earned �12,675 from employment with  that  company  in  the
        2017-18  tax  year.   There  are  payslips  for   the   Appellant's
        employment with that company up  to  end  June  2018  ([ABS/4-25]).
        Although the bundle does not include a payslip for  July  2018  and
        the supplementary bundle was not filed until 7 August 2018 (so that
        could have been  included),  I  am  prepared  to  assume  that  the
        Appellant continues to work for that company as at date of hearing.



    41. The Appellant has produced some bank statements for  the  period  6
        July  2011  to  6  August  2017  ([AB/217-292]).   There  is   some
        difficulty with ascertaining earnings from those statements as  the
        Appellant says he is paid in cash.  Some  of  the  credits  to  the
        account, for example, in 2011 show names of individuals  paying  in
        to the account.  The Appellant said in  evidence  that  he  thought
        that the individuals concerned were his employer at the time.   The
        cash or cheque payments in are not of a  regular  amount  or  on  a
        regular basis and it is therefore difficult to use that evidence as
        corroboration of employment.  In the period for which there  is  no
        other corroboration of earnings, namely from 6  April  2016  to  23
        January 2017, the total credits  shown  in  the  bank  account  are
        �2,835.   However,  of  those  credits,  two  (of  �170  and   �800
        respectively) are matched by debits to the account on the same  day
        with the description "Zoya Travel Shakeel" which casts doubt on the
        basis of the source of the funds as  being  from  employment.   The
        remainder as cash payments in do  not  substantiate  earnings  from
        employment.

    42. I appreciate that the Appellant must have been in receipt  of  some
        money on which to live.  However, when questioned by Mr Duffy about
        his income for 2013-14, the Appellant said that he was able to live
        on the low level of earnings which he received when he was  working
        because he lived with friends, shared expenses and it was therefore
        very cheap to live.  I  note  also  that  the  Appellant's  witness
        statement which is dated 22 March 2017 says that  he  worked  as  a
        self-employed teacher "between 2013 and 2016" and has been employed
        by Al-Hamra Supermarket "since January 2017". It may  be  that  the
        Appellant was helped out financially by friends in the period April
        2016 to January 2017.  It is not for me to speculate.  There is  no
        detail of any earnings from April  2016  to  January  2017  and  no
        documentary evidence to confirm that the Appellant was economically
        active in that period.

   Discussion and Conclusions

    43. I begin by considering the evidence concerning the  genuineness  of
        the Appellant's relationship with Ms [F] as,  if  the  relationship
        were not genuine then the Appellant cannot succeed.

    44. As Mr Briddock points out, the  Respondent's  decision  gives  four
        reasons for concluding that the marriage is one of convenience:

               1) The Appellant's answers in interview were evasive;

               2) It was not credible that the Appellant would not know  his
                  wife's working hours if the relationship were genuine;

               3) The Appellant and Ms [F] failed to attend  the  interviews
                  in August and September 2013;

               4) The Appellant did  not  inform  the  Respondent  that  his
                  marriage had broken down in September 2013.

    45. As Mr Briddock submitted and I  accept,  the  Respondent  does  not
        point to any instances in support of the Appellant being evasive in
        interview other than in relation to the answers given about his ex-
        wife's working patterns.  That  does  not  prevent  me  considering
        whether the interview record suggests evasiveness.  It is  possible
        for example that the exchange which I have set out  at  [11]  above
        could be seen as such an example.  However,  I  am  satisfied  that
        this, as with the exchange concerning working patterns,  is  simply
        an example of the Appellant missing the point of the  question  (as
        is evident from the need for the  representative  to  intervene  to
        explain what the interviewer was asking). I observed much the  same
        reaction from the Appellant when he was asked about the discrepancy
        of addresses which I record at [22] above.  I  am  satisfied  that,
        overall, the interview record does not suggest that  the  Appellant
        was deliberately seeking to avoid answering questions.

    46. Turning then to Ms [F]'s working pattern, as Mr Briddock submitted,
        what the Appellant appears to be describing  is  a  type  of  "zero
        hours" contract where Ms [F] would be called in at different  times
        of day. I understand why the  interviewer  would  have  thought  it
        strange that Ms [F] would be asked to come into the  restaurant  to
        clean  when  there  were  customers  eating.   However,  what   the
        Appellant actually says in his answers is that she might be  called
        at any time between 11am to 11pm and told when to come in not  that
        she  actually  went  in  at  those  times.   Further,  it  is   not
        necessarily strange for a cleaner to be  asked  to  clean  after  a
        restaurant has closed.  I was not provided with  any  detail  about
        the nature of the restaurant or employer, but this is not  said  to
        be a mainstream chain restaurant  which  might  have  a  number  of
        cleaners working formal shift  patterns.   It  is  not  implausible
        therefore that Ms [F] might have been working irregular  hours  and
        on call.

    47. As I indicate at [30]  above,  I  do  not  accept  the  Appellant's
        evidence that he did  not  attend  the  interviews  in  August  and
        September 2013 because he was suffering from depression.  As I have
        there indicated, I think it more likely  that  he  did  not  do  so
        because he thought or knew that Ms [F] would not  attend  with  him
        and that he would be obliged to disclose that the relationship  had
        broken down.  That is an indication that the  relationship  had  by
        then broken down and was no longer subsisting but that fact and the
        fact that the Appellant did not wish to tell the  Respondent  about
        the breakdown is not of itself an indication that the marriage  was
        always one of convenience.  The Appellant  may  well  have  thought
        that he would not be allowed to remain once  the  relationship  had
        broken down and for  that  reason  may  deliberately  have  avoided
        telling  the  Respondent  but  that  is  only  evidence  that   the
        relationship was no longer  subsisting  which  is  the  Appellant's
        case.

    48. The evidence in the Appellant's statement (which was not tested  in
        cross-examination) is that he married Ms [F] because he  loved  her
        and that the problems in the marriage arose because she  would  not
        stay at home with him and wanted to go out socialising.   That  may
        well be an  indication  that  Ms  [F]  was  not  committed  to  the
        relationship, but, again, is not of itself an indication  that  the
        Appellant married Ms [F] only to secure an immigration benefit.

    49. I did not find of much assistance the evidence of  those  who  gave
        oral  testimony  about  the   nature   and   genuineness   of   the
        relationship.  They only had intermittent contact with  the  couple
        and provided little detail about the nature  of  the  relationship.
        However, as Mr Briddock pointed out, Mr Duffy did not suggest  that
        any of them were lying; merely that they may  have  been  mistaken.
        In any event, as I indicate at [7] above, it is for the  Respondent
        to make out a prima facie case  before  any  evidential  burden  is
        placed on the Appellant.  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  am  not
        satisfied that the Respondent has made out a prima facie case  that
        the marriage was one of convenience.  It follows that the Appellant
        is entitled to rely on the marriage in relation to retained  and/or
        permanent rights of residence.  Regulation 10(5)(d)(i) is therefore
        satisfied.

    50. I turn to consider whether Ms [F] was exercising Treaty  rights  at
        all relevant times.  I  accept  as  did  Mr  Duffy  that  there  is
        evidence that she was working from October 2013 to March 2014.   As
        the Court of Appeal has now made clear in the case of Baigazieva  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1088,
        the relevant date for the exercise  of  Treaty  rights  by  an  EEA
        spouse in order to acquire a right of residence is  the  date  when
        divorce proceedings are initiated.  In this case, that is  at  some
        point prior to 5 December 2013 when the decree nisi was pronounced.



    51. Notwithstanding the lack of evidence  as  to  Ms  [F]'s  employment
        before October 2013, I am prepared to infer that  she  was  working
        for most of the tax year 2013-14 (see [36] above) and that she  was
        exercising Treaty rights when divorce proceedings were begun.  I do
        not accept Mr Duffy's submission that Ms [F]'s earnings are such as
        to be marginal and that they do not show genuine economic activity.
         As is made clear in Begum (see [ 6] above), the level of  earnings
        is not necessarily any indication that those  are  not  genuine  if
        there is evidence that work is genuinely being  carried  out  as  I
        accept (based on the HMRC evidence) is  the  case  here.  As  such,
        Regulations 10(5)(a) and (b) are satisfied.

    52. It is relevant to the Appellant's  case  that  he  is  entitled  to
        permanent residence to reach  a  finding  about  when  Ms  [F]  was
        exercising Treaty rights prior to the  divorce.   For  the  reasons
        given at [36] above, I am not satisfied on the evidence that Ms [F]
        was working in the tax year 2012-13.  As such,  the  earliest  date
        from when the Appellant might be able to claim a continuous  period
        of five years is from 6 April 2013, depending  on  what  the  other
        evidence shows.

    53. I turn then to whether the Appellant is able to show  that  he  has
        been exercising Treaty rights as if he  were  an  EEA  national  in
        order to satisfy Regulation 10(6).  Mr Briddock submitted that,  in
        relation to the retained right of residence, the Appellant  has  to
        show that he is exercising Treaty rights as  at  the  date  of  the
        hearing.  I  have  accepted  at  [40]  above,  that  the  Appellant
        continues to work for Al-Hamra Supermarket Ltd as at  the  date  of
        the hearing.  The Appellant is now said to be earning  �12,675  per
        annum and there is  evidence  that  this  income  is  derived  from
        genuine employment.  Accordingly, Regulation 10(6) is met  and  the
        Appellant is entitled to a retained right of residence.

    54. Although the application made  by  the  Appellant  was  one  for  a
        retained right of residence and not a permanent right of  residence
        and that is the basis on which the application  was  considered  by
        the Respondent, Mr Briddock submitted that it was  open  to  me  to
        find on the evidence that  the  Appellant  is  now  entitled  to  a
        permanent right of residence.

    55. I accept that I could find that the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  a
        permanent right of residence if that is what the evidence before me
        shows.  However, I do not accept that the evidence goes  this  far.
        As I have found at [52] above, there is no evidence to show that Ms
        [F] was exercising Treaty rights in the tax year 2012/13.  There is
        a lack of any corroboratory evidence about what she  was  doing  in
        that year.  Accordingly, the  earliest  that  the  continuous  five
        years' period could begin is 6 April 2013.

    56. If that were the only evidential  difficulty,  I  accept  that  the
        Appellant may be entitled to permanent residence on  6  April  2018
        and therefore prior to the hearing depending whether  the  earnings
        in that period were all  considered  to  be  derived  from  genuine
        economic activity.  I do not need to consider  that  issue  because
        there is a gap in the evidence as to the  Appellant's  exercise  of
        Treaty rights as I identify at [41] above.  There is no evidence as
        to what the Appellant was doing from the start of the tax year 2016
        to 23 January 2017, a gap of over nine months.  I am not  satisfied
        therefore that there is evidence  that  he  was  exercising  Treaty
        rights as if he were an EEA national from 6 April 2013 to  6  April
        2018.  It follows that the Appellant is not entitled  to  permanent
        residence.  If he has evidence of economic activity in that  period
        and  evidence  that  he  has  been  genuinely  economically  active
        throughout the period from April 2013, it is open to  him  to  make
        another application to the Respondent.



DECISION
I allow the Appellant's appeal on  the  basis  that  he  is  entitled  to  a
residence card showing that he has a retained right of residence.

                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

Background

     1. The Appellant appeals against a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Gribble  promulgated  on  9  January  2018  ("the  Decision")
        dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision
        dated 25 February 2016 refusing him a residence card on  the  basis
        of retained rights of residence as the former  family  member  (ex-
        spouse) of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the UK.

     2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan.  He claims to have entered
        the UK in 2007 and was granted leave to remain as a  student  until
        31 December 2011.  On 17 September 2010, he applied for a residence
        card as the spouse of a  Latvian  national,  Ms  [F],  who  he  had
        married on 25 July 2010.  That application was  refused  as  was  a
        second application on the same basis.  The Appellant  appealed  the
        latter refusal decision which was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge James in a decision promulgated on 20 September 2012.

     3. A third application on the  same  basis  was  again  refused.   The
        Appellant and his spouse were invited to interview on two occasions
        but failed to attend.  An appeal against the third refusal was once
        again dismissed by a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lloyd
        promulgated on 30 March 2015.

     4. The Appellant was divorced from his wife on 6 March  2014.   On  17
        September 2015, he made the application which led to  the  decision
        now under appeal.  In  refusing  the  application,  the  Respondent
        accepted that the marriage had subsisted for at least  three  years
        and that the Appellant had resided in the UK for at  least  one  of
        those years.  However, it  was  not  accepted  that  his  wife  was
        exercising Treaty rights as at the date of divorce.  The Respondent
        also  did  not  accept  that  the  Appellant   himself   had   been
        economically active following the divorce.  The Respondent  refused
        the application under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006.  The
        Respondent also did not accept that the marriage had  ever  been  a
        genuine one; in other words, he decided that the marriage  was  one
        of convenience.

     5. The Judge found that the marriage was indeed one of convenience and
        dismissed the appeal on that basis.

     6. The Appellant initially  appealed  on  three  grounds.   The  first
        ground took issue with the way in which the  Judge  approached  the
        facts and evidence surrounding the marriage.  The  second  asserted
        that the Judge had wrongly concluded at [53] of the  Decision  that
        she did not need to consider whether Ms [F] was in fact  exercising
        Treaty rights.  The third  asserted  that  the  Judge  had  wrongly
        applied the Devaseelan  principles  when  considering  the  earlier
        appeal decisions.

     7. Permission was refused by the First-tier Tribunal  but  granted  by
        Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington on 10 April 2018 for  the  following
        reasons so far as relevant:

           "...The grounds are  arguable.   The  judge  applied  Devaseelan
           [2002] UKIAT 00702 but having clearly assessed all evidence as a
           whole - see  [46],  it  is  arguable  that  the  judge's  social
           expectations displaced an objective analysis of the evidence  as
           a whole.  For  example  the  judge's  opinion  on  what  couples
           achieve by way of photographic evidence eg 'from restaurants' at
           the start of a relationship may be an arguable error."

     8. Under cover of  a  letter  dated  28  June  2018,  the  Appellant's
        solicitors sought permission to amend their grounds.   Mr  Briddock
        addressed me briefly on that  application  and  indicated  that  Mr
        Walker did not object to the  amendment.   I  therefore  agreed  to
        permit the amendment.  Mr Walker did not  seek  an  adjournment  to
        respond to the amended grounds.  Having heard from Mr  Briddock  on
        the merits, for reasons which follow and in light  of  Mr  Walker's
        further concession that the amended grounds disclose  an  error  of
        law in the Decision, I also grant permission to appeal in  relation
        to the amended grounds.

     9. The amended grounds include the original ground three  (application
        of Devaseelan) re-numbered as ground four ("Ground four").   Ground
        three is, in essence, the same ground as the original  ground  two.
        Ground two is similar although not identical to the original ground
        one.  The complaint there  pursued  is  that  the  Judge  erred  by
        imposing a subjective view of the evidence rather than  considering
        that evidence objectively.

    10. The main ground pursued by the Appellant is that the Judge  applied
        the wrong burden and standard of proof  (Ground  one).   The  other
        remaining ground (Ground Five) focusses on the Judge's treatment of
        the evidence arising from the  record  of  an  interview  with  the
        Appellant in 2016.

    11. I indicated at the end of the hearing that I found a material error
        of law, in particular on Ground one, Ground four  and  Ground  five
        and that I would elaborate on my reasons for so finding in  writing
        which I now turn to do.

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

   Ground one

    12. The Appellant challenges the way in which the Judge has  approached
        the burden and standard  of  proof  when  determining  whether  the
        Appellant's marriage is one of convenience.  The  Judge  sets  this
        out at [22] of the Decision as follows:

           "In terms of the burden of proof, I have followed the  reasoning
           of the recently decided Supreme Court  decision  of  Sadovska  v
           SSHD [2017] UKSC 54. This case  was  published  on  26.6.17  and
           effectively repeated the ruling in Rosa  which  itself  confirms
           the  position  in  Papajorgii  (EEA   spouse   -   marriage   of
           convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC). The  theme  of  the
           cases is that in cases of this nature the respondent  bears  the
           primary  burden  of  proof  to  show  the  marriage  is  one  of
           convenience on the balance  of  probabilities.   Thereafter  the
           appellant has to show on balance that the marriage is not one of
           convenience."

    13. The Judge's approach is reiterated at [43] of  the  Decision  where
        the Judge says that "the  respondent  had  discharged  the  initial
        burden  to  the  required  standard.   The  burden  shifts  to  the
        appellant to provide evidence on the balance of probabilities  that
        the relationship was genuine".

    14. Mr Briddock  fairly  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  expressly
        indicated in the original grounds  of  appeal  that  this  was  the
        correct approach ([3] of those  grounds)  but  submitted  that  the
        Appellant should not be fixed with a  concession  wrongly  made  in
        law.  I accept that submission.

    15. Mr Briddock drew my attention to what  was  actually  said  in  the
        relevant case  law.   In  Papajorgji  (EEA  spouse  -  marriage  of
        convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC) the  relevant  part  of
        the headnote reads as follows:


           "i) There is no burden at the outset  of  an  application  on  a
           claimant to demonstrate that a marriage to an  EEA  national  is
           not one of convenience.
           ii)  IS  (marriages  of  convenience)  Serbia  [2008]  UKAIT  31
           establishes only that there  is  an  evidential  burden  on  the
           claimant to address  evidence  justifying  reasonable  suspicion
           that the marriage is entered into for the predominant purpose of
           securing residence rights."

    16. The Judge also drew attention to the Court of Appeal's judgment  in
        Rosa v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWCA  Civ
        14.  Mr Briddock directed my attention to the relevant part of  the
        judgment as follows:
           "[24] In my judgment, the legal burden lies on the Secretary of
           State to prove that an otherwise valid marriage is a marriage of
           convenience so as to justify the refusal of an application for a
           residence card under the EEA Regulations. The reasoning to that
           effect in Papajorgji, as endorsed in Agho, is compelling.
           ...
           [29]  What I have set out above does little more than to expand
           upon paragraphs 33 to 37 of the decision in Papajorgji and to
           reject Mr Kellar's criticisms of the reasoning in those
           paragraphs. It seems to me that paragraph 14 of the decision in
           IS Serbia, which prompted the tribunal in Papajorgji to say what
           it did about the legal burden of proof, was seriously confused.
           It stated that the burden of proving that a marriage is not one
           of convenience lies on the appellant, but it also stated that if
           there is no evidence that could support a conclusion that the
           marriage is one of convenience, the appellant does not have to
           deal with the issue. If, however, the legal burden lies on the
           appellant, the appellant has to adduce some evidence in order to
           discharge that burden: in the absence of any evidence either
           way, the appellant will fail. I do not think that that can have
           been the result intended by the tribunal. The result that I
           think the tribunal must have intended is achieved if the legal
           burden of proof lies on the Secretary of State throughout but
           the evidential burden can shift, as explained in Papajorgji. In
           my judgment, that is the correct analysis."

    17. In the paragraphs to which I refer at  [12]  and  [13]  above,  the
        Judge has clearly understood the position  to  be  that,  once  the
        Respondent satisfies the  evidential  burden  on  him,  the  entire
        burden of proof then shifts to the Appellant.  That  is  incorrect.
        Even though,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  indicates,  there  is  an
        evidential burden on the Appellant once the Respondent has provided
        sufficient evidence to discharge the evidential burden on him,  the
        legal burden to show, on the balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
        marriage is one of convenience lies with the Respondent. The  Judge
        has clearly applied an erroneous approach.  Mr Walker  conceded  as
        much.

    18. That is though not the end of the matter as the error might not  be
        material if the Judge's approach to the evidence would have led  to
        the result that she was entitled to find that the Appellant had not
        discharged the evidential burden on him and if the  evidence  shows
        that the Respondent could thereby satisfy the  legal  burden.   For
        that reason, I turn to the other grounds on  which  I  indicated  I
        found an error of law.

   Ground four

    19. This is the originally formulated ground three.   It  concerns  the
        Judge's application of the Devaseelan principles.  Those principles
        concern the approach of a second Tribunal  to  the  findings  of  a
        first Tribunal between the same parties and emerge from the case of
        Secretary of State for the Home Department v D (Tamil) [2002] UKIAT
        00702). The principles apply as follows (taken from [39] to [41] of
        the judgment in that case):

           1) The first Judge's determination should always be the starting-
              point.

           2) Facts happening since the  first  Judge's  determination  can
              always be taken into account by the second Judge.

           3) Facts happening before the first  Judge's  determination  but
              having no relevance to the issues before him  can  always  be
              taken into account by the second Judge.

           4) Facts personal to the Appellant that were not brought to  the
              attention of the first Judge, although they were relevant  to
              the issues before him, should be treated by the second  Judge
              with the greatest circumspection.

           5) Evidence of other facts may not suffer from the same concerns
              as to credibility, but should be treated with caution.

           6) If before the second Judge, the  Appellant  relies  on  facts
              that are not materially different from those put to the first
              Judge the second Judge should regard the issues as settled by
              the first Judge's determination and make his findings in line
              with that determination.

           7) The force of the reasoning underlying guidelines (4) and  (6)
              is greatly reduced if there is some very good reason why  the
              Appellant's failure to adduce relevant  evidence  before  the
              first Judge should not be held against him.

        Those principles are said by the Tribunal not to be exhaustive.

    20. In this case, there are two  previous  appeal  decisions,  that  of
        First-tier Tribunal Judge James promulgated on  20  September  2012
        and that of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lloyd promulgated on 30 March
        2015.  The Judge, at [29] of the Decision,  referred  to  what  had
        been decided in the first of those decisions as follows:

           "[29] It was put to [the Appellant] that a judge in 2012 did not
           believe he was in a relationship.  The appellant responded  that
           he had been given permission to marry...."

    21. That point is reinforced by the Respondent's  submissions  recorded
        at [36]  of  the  Decision  and  the  Appellant's  answer  to  that
        submission  as  recorded  at  [37]  of  the  Decision.   The  Judge
        accurately sets out  the  Devaseelan  principles  at  [44]  of  the
        Decision.  She records at [45] of the Decision the  evidence  which
        was before Judge James before going on to consider  evidence  which
        was not considered in 2012.  The Judge then goes on  to  record  at
        [49] of the  Decision  the  submission  that  there  was  "evidence
        sufficient to neutralise the  past  findings  about  the  marriage"
        which submission she indicates that  she  finds  "superficially  an
        attractive argument".  Having considered the more recent  evidence,
        however, and for reasons set out at [50] to [52] of  the  Decision,
        the Judge reaches the conclusion that the marriage is indeed one of
        convenience.

    22. Although the Judge did not expressly state in the Decision that she
        adopted the findings made by Judge James, it is clear from  what  I
        say at [20] and [21] above, that the Judge  took  as  her  starting
        point the finding that she considered that Judge James had  reached
        that the relationship was  not  a  genuine  one.   As  Mr  Briddock
        pointed  out,  however,  by  reference  to  [21]  of  Judge  James'
        decision, what was at issue there was not whether the marriage  was
        a marriage of convenience for the purposes of EU  law  but  whether
        there was a "genuine and subsisting relationship" for the  purposes
        of an assessment of family life under Article 8  ECHR.   The  Judge
        found that there was not.  As it happens, the Judge may  well  have
        been right about this at that time as even on the Appellant's case,
        his marriage developed problems at an early stage.  Be that  as  it
        may, Mr Briddock is right to point out that there is  a  difference
        between a finding that a relationship is not  genuinely  continuing
        and a finding that a relationship has not  been  genuine  from  the
        outset.

    23. Although the point was not  made  to  me  in  submissions,  I  also
        observe that Judge James appears to have fallen into the same legal
        error as Judge Gribble in finding that the burden in EU law lies on
        the Appellant ([6]).

    24. For those reasons, the Judge has also  erred  by  adopting  as  her
        starting point a finding that the marriage was not  a  genuine  one
        and therefore was a marriage of  convenience.   That  was  not  the
        finding made.

   Ground Five

    25. Mr Briddock directed my  attention  to  the  Respondent's  decision
        letter refusing the application.  As he rightly  pointed  out,  the
        only reason for finding the marriage to be a sham which relates  to
        the Appellant's answers given in interview is  that  the  Appellant
        did not know his wife's shift working  pattern.   The  Judge  deals
        with this at [42] of the Decision as follows:

           "The interview in 2016 was, I appreciate,  undertaken  some  two
           years after the divorce, however the appellant knew so little of
           his wife's former employment that I cannot  find  his  responses
           demonstrate that he knew much about his wife's jobs, which given
           they had been together on his account since late 2009 was simply
           not credible."

    26. I was not particularly  impressed  by  Mr  Briddock's  attempts  to
        explain what the Appellant's answers show about his wife's  working
        patterns.  I do not though intend to comment on that further as  it
        will be a matter for submission and evidence when it comes  to  the
        re-hearing.  However, I accept Mr  Briddock's  more  general  point
        that the Judge does not there refer to the parts of  the  interview
        on which she relies, does not expand on her reasoning and does  not
        draw attention to the other  parts  of  the  interview  (which  was
        lengthy) and to what  the  remainder  of  the  Appellant's  answers
        showed.  I am satisfied that this discloses a further error of law.
         Again, Mr Walker expressly conceded as much.

   Summary

    27. For the above reasons, I find an error of law on Ground one, Ground
        four and Ground five.  Mr Briscock did not develop Ground  two  and
        accepted  that  Ground  three  stood  or  fell  depending  on   the
        Appellant's case on the other grounds.  In  light  of  what  I  say
        above, I do not need to deal with those grounds.

   Resumed hearing

    28. Both parties accepted that, having found an error of law, I  should
        retain the appeal in the Upper Tribunal.  Mr Briddock asked  though
        that the  hearing  be  adjourned  in  order  that  the  Appellant's
        witnesses could attend to give evidence.   Mr  Walker  agreed  that
        there should be an adjournment.  Although the  directions  indicate
        that parties should be ready to proceed with a hearing  to  re-make
        the decision on the  same  day,  in  this  case  I  agreed  it  was
        appropriate to adjourn.  Mr Walker only had notice of  the  amended
        grounds immediately prior to the hearing before  me  and  may  have
        formed the view on the original grounds that it was  unlikely  that
        an error of law would be found.  He was therefore unlikely to  have
        considered the need  for  cross-examination  of  witnesses.   Their
        evidence is in any event  likely  to  assist  the  Tribunal  and  I
        therefore  considered  for  reasons  of  fairness   that   it   was
        appropriate to adjourn the hearing to a later date  for  re-making.
        I have given directions in relation to  further  evidence  and  for
        that hearing below.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Decision involves the making of a material error  on
a point of law. I therefore set aside the First-tier  Tribunal  Decision  of
Judge  Gribble  promulgated  on  9  January  2018.   I  make  the  following
directions for the re-making of the decision.

DIRECTIONS

    1. Within 28 days from  the  date  when  this  decision  is  sent,  the
       Appellant shall file with the Tribunal and serve on  the  Respondent
       any further evidence on which he relies which should include  signed
       witness statements of any person who the Appellant intends  to  call
       as a witness at the next hearing.
    2. The resumed hearing will be listed on the first available date after
       35 days from the date when this decision is sent.  Time estimate  is
       half  a  day.   An  interpreter  will  not  be  booked  unless   the
       Appellant's representatives inform the Tribunal  at  least  fourteen
       days before the resumed hearing that one is required  in  order  for
       the Appellant or any of his witnesses to give evidence.
