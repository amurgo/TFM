                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant  is  a  citizen  of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo
    ("DRC"), who was born on 13th April, 1973.
2.   The appellant has a long and detailed immigration  history.   He  first
    arrived in the United Kingdom on  25th  September,  2004,  and  claimed
    asylum.  The appellant's application for  asylum  was  refused  on  5th
    March, 2005, and he appealed that decision on  31st  March,  2005,  but
    then appears to have absconded.  His appeal was heard  in  his  absence
    and was dismissed on  23rd  May,  2005,  and  his  appeal  rights  were
    exhausted on 6th June, 2005.

3    On 15th December, 2005, the appellant again claimed  asylum,  but  this
    time under an alias Udo Udoh Okwot, a citizen of Cameroon, born on 17th
    September, 1980.  A fingerprint check revealed a  multiple  application
    and the appellant was arrested.  On 3rd March, 2006, at  Croydon  Crown
    Court the appellant was found guilty of attempting to obtain  leave  to
    enter by deception and sentenced to twelve  months'  imprisonment.   He
    was  recommended  for  deportation.   He  did  not  appeal  either  his
    conviction or sentence.

4.   On 12th January, 2007, the  appellant  was  released  on  licence  from
    prison into the care of the Royal Victoria  Infirmary,  Newcastle  upon
    Tyne and later into the care of Newcastle social services.  The  former
    UK Borders Agency was informed that the appellant  was  terminally  ill
    and would not be leaving hospital.  A report from South Tees  Hospitals
    dated 27th May, 2009, states  that  the  appellant  was  diagnosed  HIV
    positive in January  2007  with  toxoplasmosis  encephalitis.   He  has
    significant memory loss and is, or was at that time,  in  a  care  home
    with the support of workers to assist him on a daily  basis.   On  10th
    May, 2010, UK Borders Agency received a letter from South Tees  General
    Hospital indicating their support to an application by the appellant to
    remain in the United Kingdom.

5.   On 14th May, 2010, the appellant  was  notified  of  his  liability  to
    deportation from the United  Kingdom.   On  18th  November,  2010,  the
    appellant stated that he  wished  to  return  home  to  the  Democratic
    Republic of the Congo and on 6th December, 2010, this  was  amended  to
    Cameroon.  On 7th December, 2010, a letter was sent  to  the  appellant
    indicating that he could return, voluntarily  to  Cameroon,  or  via  a
    facilitated return scheme to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  On 13th
    December, 2010, the appellant stated that he was from DRC and not  from
    Congo, but he still wished to return to  Congo,  since  he  had  family
    living there.  On 11th March, 2011, the appellant indicated that he  no
    longer wished to return to Cameroon,  and  instead  wanted  his  asylum
    claim to be considered.  On 10th May, 2011, he indicated that he wished
    to return to Congo and a further letter was sent to him indicating that
    he could return voluntarily to Cameroon, or with the facilitated return
    scheme to the DRC.  On 16th May, 2011, UK Borders Agency received a fax
    withdrawing the asylum claim.

6.   On 23rd September, 2011, the appellant's social worker  confirmed  that
    the  appellant  did  wish  to  return  to  the  DRC,  at  the  earliest
    opportunity.  The same day a disclaimer was sent to him for him to sign
    withdrawing any outstanding application.  On 18th  October,  2011,  the
    signed disclaimer in the case of voluntary departure was received at UK
    Borders Agency, signed and dated by  the  appellant  on  11th  October,
    2011.

7.   On 14th November, 2011, a new ICD 0350, Notice of Intention  to  Deport
    was issued to the appellant giving him ten working days to  reply.   On
    15th December, 2011, UK Border Agency wrote to the appellant requesting
    a recent medical report from his doctor or consultant.  This letter was
    dated 22nd December, 2011, and received by the UK Borders Agency on 5th
    January, 2012.   The  letter  was  from  South  Tees  Hospital  and  it
    confirmed that the appellant's CD4 count was 589, with a viral load  of
    more than 20.  Italso confirmed that he  was  receiving  Tenofovir  245
    milligrams per day, Kaletra two tablets twice daily  and  Combivir  one
    tablet twice daily, as well as  Lansoprazole  and  Metroclopramide,  as
    required.  It confirmed that the  appellant's  viral  control  to  this
    regime had been  excellent.   The  hospital  also  confirmed  that  the
    appellant is hepatitis B immune.

8.   On 3rd February, 2012, a  new  Notice  of  Deportation  decision,  plus
    covering letter, was sent to the appellant at his last  known  address.
    Unfortunately it was returned by the Royal Mail marked, "addressee gone
    away", on 23rd February, 2012.  On 25th April, 2012, UK Borders  Agency
    wrote to the appellant's solicitors enclosing the Notice of Deportation
    letter, giving ten working days from receipt to reply and no reply  was
    received.  As a result the Secretary of State made a Decision to make a
    Deportation Order on 25th May, 2012.

9.   The appellant appealed that decision to the First-tier Tribunal  and  a
    panel of the Tribunal, First-tier Tribunal Judge D J B Trotter  sitting
    with Mrs L R Schmitt, heard the appellant's appeal  on  13th  December,
    2012.  In a  determination  promulgated  on  2nd  January,  2013,  they
    concluded that the appellant's removal would  not  breach  the  Refugee
    Convention and they dismissed his human rights appeal.

10.  I granted permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  22nd  March,
    2013.  There were three challenges to the panel's  determination.   The
    first alleging an error  in  the  treatment  of  proportionality.   The
    second erring in the assessment of proportionality in relation  to  the
    lack of care the appellant would have in the DRC and the last challenge
    was effectively a repeat of the first.

11.  At the hearing today, Counsel addressed me  suggesting,  amongst  other
    things, that in assessing proportionality and particularly  bearing  in
    mind the support the Tribunal had noted  that  the  appellant  receives
    from  Ms  Lavine,  the  Tribunal  failed  at  paragraph  28  of   their
    determination to consider that on return to the DRC the appellant would
    have no one to assist him with his daily care.  That she suggested  was
    an error of law.

12.  Responding Mr Dewison sought to persuade me that there  was  no  error,
    but indicated that in view of the fact that the Tribunal had  concluded
    that they were not going to allow the appeal, they must by  implication
    have considered the lack of care available to the appellant in the DRC.



13.  I indicated that I was  satisfied  that  the  grounds  do  disclose  an
    error.  I indicated to the representatives that I was minded  to  remit
    the appeal for hearing afresh before a  new  panel  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in exercise of my powers under Section 12(2)(B2) of  the  2007
    Act.  Both representatives agreed that that was an appropriate  course.



14.  I am satisfied  that  this  is  a  case  which  falls  squarely  within
    paragraph 7 of the Senior President's  Practice  Statement,  given  the
    length of time the parties would have to wait  for  the  matter  to  be
    relisted before me in North Shields or  at  Field  House  and  that  it
    could, conversely, be  heard  relatively  speedily  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and in view of the overriding objective in forming the  onward
    conduct in this appeal  I  have  decided  that  the  appeal  should  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh before a  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  Immigration  Judge  David  Trotter.
    Whether or not the judge sits with a lay member will be  a  matter  for
    the First-tier Tribunal.
