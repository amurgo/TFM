                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

1.          By a decision made on the papers without a hearing and dated  25
      August 2020, I found an error of law in  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Obhi promulgated on  29  October  2019  dismissing  the
      Appellant's appeal.  I therefore set  aside  that  decision  and  gave
      directions for a resumed hearing in this Tribunal.   My error  of  law
      decision is annexed hereto for ease of reference.  Notwithstanding the
      High Court's judgment in JCWI v The President of  the  Upper  Tribunal
      (IAC) [2020] EWHC 3103 (Admin) neither party has sought to  set  aside
      my decision.

2.          The resumed hearing was listed before me on  25  November  2020.
      That hearing had to be adjourned due to a lack of preparedness on  the
      part of the Respondent.  The Senior Presenting Officer had not seen my
      error  of  law  decision.   As  I  will  come  to,   the   Appellant's
      circumstances had also changed as a result of the birth of her  child.
      It was accepted by the Respondent that  the  Tribunal  could  consider
      that changed circumstance and the Senior Presenting Officer  suggested
      that the adjournment would also give time for reconsideration of  that
      changed circumstance.  My adjournment decision is also annexed  hereto
      for ease of reference.

3.          In my adjournment decision,  I  gave  directions  requiring  the
      parties  to  file  further  evidence  relevant  to   the   immigration
      chronology in this case which is particularly complex.  The Respondent
      has not complied with those directions.  For reasons I will  come  to,
      however, I consider that I am in a position to determine the issues in
      this case without that further evidence.

4.          I have before me  a  bundle  of  core  documents  including  the
      Respondent's bundle, the Appellant's bundle as before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (referred to hereafter as [AB/xx]),  the  Appellant's  bundle
      prepared for the November hearing (referred to hereafter as  [AB2/xx])
      and the Appellant's bundle for this hearing (referred to hereafter  as
      [AB3/xx]).  I also have as a separate document a  chronology  prepared
      by Ms Cunha who appeared for the Respondent at  the  November  hearing
      and which I have found useful in order  to  set  out  the  Appellant's
      immigration  history.   I  also  have  a  skeleton  argument  for  the
      Appellant.   Although the Appellant and her husband were both  present
      at the hearing, it was not suggested that I should hear oral  evidence
      from them.  Mr Kamal indicated that it was not necessary to call  them
      and Mr Tufan did not ask to cross-examine them.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

5.          It is necessary to set out the Appellant's  immigration  history
      in some detail due to the importance of this to her status now.

6.          The Appellant came to the UK on 22 October 2012  as  the  spouse
      of her husband, Mr Razzak Hossain who was  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  2
      migrant.  She was named as the dependant on her husband's  application
      made on 22 January 2015 for further  leave  in  that  capacity.   That
      application was refused by the Respondent on 9 December  2015  on  the
      basis that the Appellant's husband had used a proxy  test  taker  when
      sitting  an  English  language  test  ("the  ETS  allegation").    The
      Appellant and her husband appealed.  The appeal  decision  promulgated
      on 17 July 2017 is at [AB/158-162].  The appeal  was  allowed  on  the
      basis that the ETS allegation was not made out.   The Judge  purported
      to remit the Tier 2 application to the Respondent  to  decide  whether
      the certificate of  sponsorship  relied  upon  related  to  a  genuine
      vacancy.  It is not clear to me that the Judge had any jurisdiction to
      do this.  The appeal could only be on the ground that the Respondent's
      refusal breached the Appellant's (and  her  husband's)  human  rights.
      The appeal was on that basis allowed.

7.          No leave to remain was subsequently granted based either on  the
      outcome of the appeal or the Tier 2 application.  As  appears  from  a
      letter dated 5 October 2017 at [AB/155], the Respondent indicated that
      she would aim to implement the Judge's decision as soon  as  possible.
      There is nothing to indicate that any leave was subsequently  granted.
       It is however worthy of note that the Appellant's case  and  that  of
      her husband on whose application she was at the  time  dependent  were
      being handled by the "Post Decision Casework Unit".

8.          On 26 October 2018, Mr Hossain's solicitors made an  application
      for him to remain based on his long residence.  This  application  was
      therefore for indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") and not as a  Tier  2
      migrant or for limited leave to remain based on Article 8  ECHR.   The
      covering letter to that application is at [AB3/56-61].  I record  that
      the application is made only in the name of Mr Hossain.  There  is  no
      mention of the Appellant.  I was shown by Mr Tufan the  Home  Office's
      Long Residence Guidance  Version  16.0  which  states  in  terms  that
      "[t]here is no provision within the Immigration Rules for an applicant
      to include dependants on a long residence application".  It is  stated
      very clearly that "[d]ependants must make their own sole  applications
      if they wish to rely on the 10 year long residence rule."  Of  course,
      by that time, the Appellant had not lived in the  UK  for  ten  years.
      Indeed, she has  not  done  so  even  now.   She  could  not  make  an
      application on that basis in her own right.

9.          On 7 November 2018, Mr Hossain's  solicitors  again  wrote  this
      time to the Post Decision Casework Unit.  The letter is  at  [AB3/61].
      Again, that letter is headed with reference only to Mr Hossain.  There
      is no mention of the Appellant.  The content  of  that  letter  is  of
      importance, and I therefore set it out in full:

            "RE: VARIATION OF APPLICATION; MR RAZZAK HOSSAIN, DOB: 12/12/84:
           BANGLADESHI NATIONAL
                 Dear Sirs,
            We act for the above named person.   We  refer  to  your  letter
           dated 5 October 2017 - copy attached.
            We understand that the implementation of the appeal decision  of
           the above case will be undertaken by the Post Decision  Casework
           Unit  in  Sheffield.   However,  our  client  made  a  variation
           application on 26 October 2018 for indefinite leave to remain in
           the United Kingdom  as  his  material  circumstances  have  been
           changed.   Therefore,  his  previous   application   (Case   ID:
           018846200) has been varied to  his  present  application  (Royal
           Mail Ref: AF434986773B).  Please update your records.
            If we can be of further assistance, please do  not  hesitate  to
           contact us."
            [my emphasis]

10.         That then led it appears to  a  refund  of  an  application  fee
      ([AB3/62]).  It is not entirely clear which fee  was  being  refunded.
      However, since the Respondent went on to  grant  the  application  for
      long residence, it must be assumed that  the  refund  related  to  the
      application  which  was  at  that  time  pending  reconsideration  and
      implementation.  The long residence application was granted on 8 March
      2019 ([AB3/63-64]).  As with the application itself, the grant related
      only to Mr Hossain.  There is no mention of the Appellant.  Since  the
      grant of ILR, Mr Hossain has  gone  on  to  naturalise  as  a  British
      citizen.  As I will come  to,  Mr  Hossain's  status  means  that  the
      Appellant's child is also a British citizen.

11.         The Respondent's position is that the Appellant's leave came  to
      an  end   when   her   husband's   application   which   was   pending
      implementation/reconsideration was varied.  As she was a dependant  on
      that application and had no application  pending  in  her  own  right,
      whatever the intention of the Appellant and her  husband,  I  consider
      that this is correct as a matter of law.

12.         The Respondent says  in  her  decision  under  appeal  that  the
      application was voided at the Appellant's request on 21 November 2018.
       The Appellant disputes that any such request was made.  I can find no
      document of that date nor any express request but I consider  that  to
      be  consistent  with  the  dates  of  the  correspondence   concerning
      variation and the  subsequent  refund  of  the  fee  for  the  pending
      application.  Any delay between 7  November  2018  when  Mr  Hossain's
      solicitors wrote expressly requesting to vary the decision and the  21
      November date is probably explained by delay in receipt and action  by
      the Home Office.   The reference in the decision  under  appeal  to  a
      request to void the application can only be read as a reference to the
      7 November 2018 letter.

13.         There is nothing to explain  why,  in  those  circumstances  the
      Appellant's solicitors waited until 14 January 2019 before  making  an
      application in her name.  The covering letter to that  application  is
      at [AB/11-15].  It is similarly headed up as a  variation  application
      this time for "leave to remain/discretionary leave to  remain  in  the
      United Kingdom based on family life as a  partner,  human  rights  and
      compassionate grounds".  It  is  explained  in  the  letter  that  the
      Appellant's husband had already applied for ILR.  However, although it
      is stated that the Appellant wished to apply for leave  to  remain  as
      the spouse of a settled person, her husband did not by that time  have
      ILR.  It was not granted until March 2019.  That  therefore  does  not
      explain the delay in making this application.

14.          The  letter  asks  for  the  Appellant's  application   to   be
      considered alongside her husband's but there is no explanation why she
      did not make this application  at  the  same  time  as  her  husband's
      application.  It is asserted that the Appellant had not overstayed for
      more than fourteen days because her section 3C leave had been extended
      by  the  outstanding  reconsideration/implementation  of  the   appeal
      decision.  As I have already concluded, however, that was incorrect as
      that earlier application on which the Appellant was  a  dependant  had
      already been varied by the long residence application.   By  the  time
      the application was made in her own right,  therefore,  the  Appellant
      had already been an overstayer for  well  over  one  month.   She  has
      remained an overstayer since.

15.         The final factual point of note is the birth of the  Appellant's
      daughter on 16 August 2020 ([AB2/46]).  She is a British citizen.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

16.         As  the  Appellant  was  at  the  date  of  the  application  an
      overstayer and had overstayed for more  than  fourteen  days,  she  is
      unable to meet all of the eligibility requirements in the  Immigration
      Rules ("the Rules").  She can however succeed within the Rules if  she
      meets EX.1 of Appendix FM to the Rules ("EX.1") either as a result  of
      her relationship with her husband  or  as  the  mother  of  a  British
      citizen child.

17.         Paragraph EX.1 reads as follows:

            "EX.1. This paragraph applies if
           (a)
           (i) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting parental
           relationship with a child who-
           (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of 18
           years when the applicant was first granted leave on the basis
           that this paragraph applied;
           (bb) is in the UK;
           (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK continuously
           for at least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of
           application; and
           (ii) taking into account their best interests as a primary
           consideration, it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
           leave the UK; or
           (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
           a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in
           the UK, or ..., and there are insurmountable obstacles to family
           life with that partner continuing outside the UK.
           EX.2. For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) 'insurmountable
           obstacles' means the very significant difficulties which would
           be faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their
           family life together outside the UK and which could not be
           overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
           or their partner."

18.         Even if the Appellant does not satisfy the test  under  EX.1,  I
      must still consider whether, having regard to the balance between  the
      interference with the private and family lives of the  Appellant,  her
      husband and child on the one hand  and  the  public  interest  on  the
      other,  removal  of  the  Appellant  would  have  unjustifiably  harsh
      consequences for the Appellant and  her  family  (see  Gen  3.2(2)  of
      Appendix FM to the Rules  -  "Appendix  FM").   That  the  outcome  of
      consideration under EX.1 is not determinative of the  appeal  in  this
      case is made plain by what is said by the Supreme Court in Agarko  and
      Ikuga v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  UKSC  11  (
      "Agyarko") at [45] as follows:

              "45.              By   virtue   of    paragraph    EX.1(b),
           'insurmountable obstacles' are treated as a requirement for  the
           grant of leave under the Rules in cases to which that  paragraph
           applies. Accordingly, interpreting the expression  in  the  same
           sense as in the Strasbourg case law, leave to remain  would  not
           normally be granted in cases where an  applicant  for  leave  to
           remain under the partner route  was  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
           immigration laws, unless the applicant or  their  partner  would
           face very serious difficulties in continuing their  family  life
           together outside the UK, which could not be  overcome  or  would
           entail  very  serious  hardship.  Even  in  a  case  where  such
           difficulties  do  not  exist,  however,  leave  to  remain   can
           nevertheless  be  granted  outside  the  Rules  in  'exceptional
           circumstances', in accordance with the Instructions: that is  to
           say,  in  'circumstances  in  which  refusal  would  result   in
           unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual  such  that
           refusal of the application would not be proportionate'.."

            Mr Tufan very fairly accepted that to be the position.

19.         When  considering  the  public  interest  question  outside  the
      Rules,  I  have  to  have  regard  to  the  factors  in  section  117B
      Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002   Act")
      ("Section 117B").  That includes  the  need  for  the  maintenance  of
      effective immigration control.  It also includes the issue whether  it
      is reasonable for the Appellant's minor British child to  be  expected
      to return to Bangladesh (Section 117B(6)).

20.         As  is  made  clear  by  section  55  Borders,  Citizenship  and
      Immigration Act 2009 ("Section 55") and EX.1, I must  have  regard  to
      the best interests of the Appellant's  child.   That  includes  having
      regard not only to the present impact on that child of removal of  her
      mother but also the impact in terms of that child's  citizenship.   As
      was said by the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) v  Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4 at [41] of the judgment:

            "... there is much more to British citizenship than  the  status
           it gives to the children in immigration law. It carries with  it
           a host of other benefits and advantages, all of which Lady  Hale
           has drawn attention to and carefully analysed. They ought  never
           to be left out of account, but they were nowhere  considered  in
           the Court of Appeal's judgment. The fact of British  citizenship
           does not trump everything else. But it will hardly ever be  less
           than a  very  significant  and  weighty  factor  against  moving
           children who have that status to another country with  a  parent
           who has no right to remain here, especially  if  the  effect  of
           doing this is that they will inevitably lose those benefits  and
           advantages for the rest of their childhood."


21.         The best interests of the  child  are  a  primary  consideration
      although not paramount.  The weight to be given to  the  rights  of  a
      British citizen child in this scenario is however echoed  in  comments
      made by the Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan) and others v Secretary of
      State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 705.

22.   As the  Supreme  Court  made  clear  in  KO  (Nigeria)  and  others  v
      Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2018]  UKSC  53  ("KO
      (Nigeria)"), the issue whether it is reasonable to expect the child to
      leave has to be considered in the real  world  context.   The  Supreme
      Court made the following observations:


           "18.              On  the  other  hand,  as  the  IDI  guidance
           acknowledges,  it  seems  to  me  inevitably  relevant  in  both
           contexts to consider where the parents, apart from the  relevant
           provision, are  expected  to  be,  since  it  will  normally  be
           reasonable for the child to be with them.  To  that  extent  the
           record of the parents may  become  indirectly  material,  if  it
           leads to their ceasing to have  a  right  to  remain  here,  and
           having to leave. It is only if,  even  on  that  hypothesis,  it
           would not  be  reasonable  for  the  child  to  leave  that  the
           provision may give the parents a right to remain. The point  was
           well-expressed by Lord Boyd in SA (Bangladesh) v Secretary  of
           State for the Home  Department 2017  SLT  1245, [2017]  ScotCS
           CSOH_117:
                 '22.     In my opinion before one embarks on an  assessment
                 of whether it is reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
                 the UK one has to address  the  question,  'Why  would  the
                 child be expected to leave the United Kingdom?' In  a  case
                 such as this there can only be  one  answer:  'because  the
                 parents have no right to remain in the UK'. To approach the
                 question in any other way strips away the context in  which
                 the assessment of reasonableness is being made ...'
           19.              He noted (para 21) that Lewison LJ had made  a
           similar point in considering the "best interests" of children in
           the context of  section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
           Immigration Act 2009 in EV (Philippines) v Secretary  of  State
           for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874, para 58:
                 '58.     In my judgment, therefore, the assessment  of  the
                 best interests of the children must be made  on  the  basis
                 that the facts are as they are in the real  world.  If  one
                 parent has no right to remain, but the other  parent  does,
                 that is the background  against  which  the  assessment  is
                 conducted. If neither parent has the right to remain,  then
                 that is the background  against  which  the  assessment  is
                 conducted. Thus  the  ultimate  question  will  be:  is  it
                 reasonable to expect the child to follow the parent with no
                 right to remain to the country of origin?'
           To the extent that Elias LJ may have suggested otherwise  in MA
           (Pakistan) para 40, I would  respectfully  disagree.  There  is
           nothing in the section to suggest that 'reasonableness' is to be
           considered otherwise  than  in  the  real  world  in  which  the
           children find themselves."

23.         As the Supreme Court also made clear in KO (Nigeria), the  issue
      of reasonableness in relation to the expectation of  a  child  leaving
      the UK has to be determined by reference to the impact on  that  child
      alone.  That question does not involve consideration of  the  parents'
      immigration history.  It is only once one gets to the balance  between
      interference and public interest that the immigration history  of  the
      parents has a part to play.  As the extract from KO (Nigeria) which  I
      have set out shows, however, the issue of  reasonableness  has  to  be
      considered against the background of the immigration status of one  or
      both of the parents.

24.         Finally, I need  to  refer  to  the  Tribunal's  entitlement  to
      consider the position of the child.  That is a matter which has arisen
      since the Appellant's application was made in January 2019 and  indeed
      since the application was refused in June 2019 by the  decision  under
      appeal.  It is therefore a "new matter" which the  Tribunal  does  not
      have jurisdiction to consider without the consent  of  the  Respondent
      (section 85(5) of the 2002 Act - "Section 85(5)")).  At  the  time  of
      the adjournment decision in November 2020, the view was taken by  this
      Tribunal in Birch (Precariousness and mistake:  new  matter:  Jamaica)
      [2020] UKUT 86 (IAC) ("Birch") that Section  85(5)  did  not  preclude
      this  Tribunal  (as  distinct  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal)   from
      considering  any  such  new  matters  without  the  consent   of   the
      Respondent.  Since then, the Tribunal in Hydar  (s120  response;  "new
      matter": Birch) [2021] UKUT 0176 (IAC) has determined that approach to
      be incorrect (see (3) of the headnote).  Nonetheless, in this case, Ms
      Cunha had indicated at the previous hearing that the Respondent wished
      to reconsider the Appellant's position in light of the  birth  of  her
      child and, although that has not happened, Mr Tufan accepted that this
      was an indication by the Respondent that she was content for  the  new
      matter to be considered and  he  accepted  that  the  Tribunal  should
      consider it.  I therefore have the Respondent's consent to  take  into
      account the impact of the Appellant's removal on her child.

 EVIDENCE, FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

25.         Set against that legal framework, I then turn  to  consider  the
      evidence.  I do not  need  to  repeat  what  I  have  said  about  the
      immigration history of the Appellant or her husband.  That is set  out
      under the heading of "Factual Background" and includes my finding that
      the Appellant is  an  overstayer  albeit  it  clearly  was  never  her
      intention to overstay.  I have regard in particular to what is said by
      the Appellant in her statement dated 22 July 2021 ([AB3/13-15])  that,
      following her and her husband's successful appeal, she was waiting for
      leave to be granted (� 5).  I also have regard to her assertion (which
      I accept) that she did not expressly ask for the previous  application
      to be voided (�16).  Unfortunately for her, she was only  a  dependant
      on that previous application and the effect of her husband varying the
      application on which she was a dependant to one on which she could  no
      longer be a dependant has had unforeseen consequences for  her.    She
      says in that paragraph that she is entitled to a refund,  but  she  is
      not.  The previous application was made by her  husband,  and  he  did
      receive a refund of the fee ([AB3/62]).

26.         Unfortunately, the Appellant does not explain what  led  to  the
      making of the application in January 2019 and why that  could  not  be
      made at  the  same  time  as  or  very  shortly  after  the  variation
      application made by her husband.  It cannot be suggested that she  was
      awaiting the outcome of  her  husband's  application  for  ILR  before
      making her application as it was made whilst her husband's application
      for ILR remained pending.  It may be that her then solicitors realised
      the predicament in which they had  placed  her  by  their  actions  in
      relation to her husband and sought to  remedy  it.   That  is  however
      somewhat speculative on my part.  However, I do take into account that
      at some point the Appellant and those advising her must have  realised
      the situation in which she had been placed and sought  to  remedy  it.
      The Appellant did not simply bury her  head  in  the  sand  until  her
      husband's situation was resolved  and  deliberately  overstay  in  the
      meanwhile.  That is to her credit.

27.         The Appellant's application was refused by the  Respondent  only
      on the basis that  she  is  unable  to  meet  the  immigration  status
      requirement unless EX.1 applies.  It is accepted  that  the  Appellant
      meets the eligibility requirement as regards her relationship  with  a
      person settled in the UK (now also a British citizen).  It is accepted
      that the suitability requirements are met.  It is also  accepted  that
      both the financial and English language requirements  of  Appendix  FM
      are met.

28.         I turn then to consider whether EX.1 is met. Before I deal  with
      this, I ought to clear up one oddity about this case.  It is  said  in
      the Appellant's husband's witness statement at  [AB3/17-18]  that  the
      Appellant cannot be expected to leave the UK and go  to  Pakistan  not
      least because she is Bangladeshi (�17-18).  I suspect this arises from
      an error in the Respondent's  decision  letter  which  refers  in  the
      heading to the Appellant being from Pakistan.  As is confirmed by  her
      passport at [AB3/19], she is from Bangladesh as is her husband.   Both
      were born in Sylhet.  The  issue  I  have  to  consider  therefore  is
      whether it would be unreasonable for the Appellant's child  to  go  to
      live in Bangladesh and whether there would be insurmountable obstacles
      to the Appellant and her husband continuing their family life in  that
      country.

29.         I begin with the position of the  Appellant's  child  since  her
      best interests are in any event  a  primary  consideration  within  my
      assessment.

30.         The Appellant's child is now aged one year.  It is  self-evident
      that, at that age, her best interests are  to  remain  with  both  her
      parents who are in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  At her very
      young age, probably the more important of her parents for her purposes
      is her mother but I accept that it is in her best interests to  remain
      with both her parents.

31.         The child's father is a  British  citizen  and  is  entitled  to
      remain in the UK.  He cannot forcibly be removed.   Equally,  however,
      in circumstances where his wife has no right to remain, if she were to
      be removed, I have no reason to think that he would not leave with her
      and their child.  I have already dealt with the point he  makes  about
      the Appellant not being able to go to live in Pakistan.  She would  be
      returning to Bangladesh.  He says that he has  a  private  and  family
      life in the UK through his residence and work but offers  very  little
      detail (see below).  He is a British citizen but that is not of itself
      reason why family life could  not  be  continued  in  Bangladesh  (see
      Agyarko in this regard).  He says in his statement at [AB/8]  that  he
      could not bear to be separated from his wife even for a day (�6).

32.         I consider it likely therefore that if the Appellant were to  be
      removed, her husband and child would accompany her.  That is the  real
      world situation which would face the family.

33.         I have very limited if any information about the child.   It  is
      not suggested that the child is other than a healthy  baby.   Although
      she is a British citizen, that is not something of which she will  yet
      be aware.  Both her parents are Bangladeshi and will be very  familiar
      with the culture of that country.  Her father left  in  2009  and  her
      mother in 2012.  I am not told if they still have other family members
      in Bangladesh but even if they do not, there is no reason  why  either
      or both parents would be unable to find  work  in  Bangladesh.   I  am
      provided with no evidence that they would be unable to do so.

34.         I take into account the citizenship of the  child.  I  am  aware
      that removal of her mother would entail a loss  of  benefits  for  the
      child if she were to return to Bangladesh.  That is a factor to  which
      I give some weight  and  I  accept  that  for  that  reason  her  best
      interests are favoured by  remaining  in  the  UK  with  her  parents.
      However, overall her best interests are more  strongly  in  favour  of
      remaining with her parents  wherever  they  are  living.   I  have  no
      evidence to show that it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child
      to return to Bangladesh with her parents.  EX.1 is not for that reason
      met by the Appellant's relationship with her child.

35.         As is evident from what I say above, I cannot find  either  that
      there are insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant's family life with
      her husband continuing in Bangladesh.

36.         In his statement dated 7 October 2019 ([AB8-9), the  Appellant's
      husband says the following about return to Bangladesh:

            "7.  I have been working  full  time  with  Surma  Travels  (UK)
           Private  Ltd  as  an  Account  Manager.  My  income  is   around
           �35,000.00 which is more than  �18,600  (the  current  financial
           requirement).  We submitted specified documents  in  support  of
           the income with the original application.  My wife has also been
           working as a carer with Care Solution Breau  [sic]  CIC  in  the
           United Kingdom.  She gets monthly �800 from my job.  The  nature
           of my work does not allow me to access  more  than  three  weeks
           leave and if my partner goes to Bangladesh it will be  hard  for
           me to sustain to my obligations, job contract,  as  well  as  my
           relationship with my partner.  Also, my  partner  cannot  go  to
           Bangladesh because she has been  receiving  fertility  treatment
           from the NHS since 2017.
             8.    I  am  very  independent  and  able  to  lead   my   life
           independently in UK.  I have the flat which I am renting  and  I
           was solely responsible for all expenses.  I will not be able  to
           live a life in Bangladesh that I already have  developed  in  UK
           and it will put me in to a risk of my life and career.  We  have
           planned to buy our own house and have personnel  [sic]  mortgage
           in the future to have secured future and better life.  My  dream
           will be shattered as well as her if we are to be separated  from
           each other and it will have huge impact on our future life.
            9.   I strongly believe that Bangladesh is not suitable  for  my
           partner and for me because she cannot provide  shelter  or  bear
           the living expenses.
            10.  We have been living in the UK  for  many  years.   We  have
           been adopted UK's culture, beliefs and life style as clearly  we
           cannot live in Bangladesh.  Most important of our life  time  we
           have spent in UK.
            11.  Most  importantly,  my  partner  and  I  have  been  living
           together for a long time and we were not blessed  with  a  child
           yet.  My partner has been receiving treatments in  this  regard.
           If she were to return to Bangladesh, she would not receive  same
           treatment as treatments are not free in Bangladesh.
            12.  We have  close  families  living  in  UK  who  are  British
           citizen and we have very good close relationship with them.   We
           have close relationship and share good bonding  with  our  close
           relatives.  I cannot imagine living in Bangladesh.  It would  be
           wholly unjust for me and my partner to return to Bangladesh."

            What is there said is echoed in almost identical  terms  by  the
      Appellant in her statement of the same date at [AB/5-6].

37.          There  have  of  course  been  some  developments  since  those
      statements.  The couple now have a child.  There  is  no  evidence  of
      continuing fertility treatment nor any evidence that such treatment is
      not available in Bangladesh.  The Appellant's husband speaks of moving
      to Bangladesh to be a risk to  his  life  but  does  not  provide  any
      particulars.  He has never made any protection claim.   The  Appellant
      and her husband were apparently at the time of their statements living
      with his uncle who is a British citizen and has lived in the UK  since
      2002.  However, other than confirming that they lived with him in 2019
      ([AB/26]) there is no information about the uncle's  family  or  their
      relationship between them and the Appellant and her husband.  The only
      evidence  about  that  family  is  to  be  found  in  the  Appellant's
      application at [AB/44] indicating that she and her husband  live  with
      his uncle and aunt and that they have two minor children.  There is no
      other evidence from those family members.

38.         The Appellant's husband was in his twenties when he came to  the
      UK.  He grew up in Bangladesh and was educated there.   The  Appellant
      was similarly in  her  early  twenties  when  she  came  here  as  her
      husband's  dependant.   The  couple  married  in  Bangladesh  in  2012
      ([AB3/25]).  At that time, it appears from the Nikahnama  at  [AB3/26-
      27] that both sets  of  parents  were  alive  and  living  in  Sylhet.
      According to the Appellant's application ([AB/27-48]),  the  Appellant
      has "some friends and family in Bangladesh".   Both the Appellant  and
      her husband speak Bengali.  Perhaps the  clearest  evidence  that  the
      Appellant  and  her  husband  could  continue  their  family  life  in
      Bangladesh comes  in  the  response  given  to  the  question  in  the
      application seeking an explanation why they could  not  live  together
      outside  the  UK.   The  response  given  is  "N/A  AS   IT   IS   NOT
      DISPROPORTIONATE TO RETURN TO BANGLADESH" ([AB/37]).  I  consider  the
      evidence about obstacles to the couple living in Bangladesh as set out
      in their statements to be overstated.  There  is  no  evidence  beyond
      their mere assertions that they could not do so.

39.              For the foregoing reasons, I do not  accept  that  EX.1  is
      met either by reason of the Appellant's relationship with her child or
      her husband.

40.         Nevertheless, I must go on to consider the position outside  the
      Rules.  When doing so, I again have regard to the  best  interests  of
      the Appellant's child as well as the other factors in Section 117B.

41.         I have already made the finding that it is not  unreasonable  to
      expect the Appellant's child to go with the Appellant to Bangladesh if
      she is removed.  That is also therefore  the  position  under  Section
      117B (6).  Nonetheless, when  assessing  the  interference  under  the
      Rules I also have regard to my previous finding that the child's  best
      interests are favoured by remaining in the UK so that,  as  she  grows
      up, she can exercise the rights and privileges  which  come  with  her
      British citizenship.

42.          The  Appellant  speaks  English   and   meets   the   financial
      requirements of the Rules.  Those are neutral factors when considering
      Section 117B, but I take into account that the factors are not adverse
      to her.  The financial documents in the Appellant's  evidence  confirm
      that the Appellant's husband is working and  earning  a  good  income.
      The bank statements etc show healthy balances.  The family is  clearly
      self-sufficient.

43.         Whilst there is limited evidence of the family's integration  in
      the UK, the Appellant and her husband have both worked here  and  both
      speak English.  I do not have evidence from their  family  members  or
      any friends they have in the UK, but I accept that they are integrated
      here having spent nine and twelve years respectively in the  UK.   The
      Appellant's  husband  has  taken  the  step   of   acquiring   British
      citizenship.

44.         Although the couple retain  ties  to  Bangladesh  and  have  not
      shown there to be insurmountable obstacles to being able  to  continue
      their family life in that  country,  I  accept  that  there  would  be
      disruption to their private and family lives  if  the  Appellant  were
      removed to Bangladesh and her husband and child were  to  follow  her.
      That disruption is not insignificant given their length of  residence,
      work and the citizenship of their child.

45.           The   issue   then   becomes   one   of   justification    and
      proportionality.  Would the interference be unjustifiably harsh?  That
      involves consideration of the very unusual aspects of this case.   The
      Appellant's husband has always been lawfully resident  in  the  UK  as
      accepted by the Respondent when  granting  him  ILR.   Whilst  an  ETS
      allegation was made against him, that was not upheld on appeal.  There
      can therefore be no  criticism  of  him  as  regards  his  immigration
      history.

46.         The Appellant and her husband followed the  Rules  when  seeking
      to come to the UK.  The Appellant was granted entry clearance to  come
      here as her husband's dependant based on his  work  in  the  UK.   The
      reasons why the application for further leave failed were  not  upheld
      on appeal.  The couple could therefore have  expected  to  be  granted
      further  leave  and,  in  due  course,  to  be  entitled   to   remain
      indefinitely.  The Appellant's husband was in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  2
      migrant on a potential route to settlement.

47.         The Appellant's and her husband's  appeals  were  allowed  by  a
      Judge in July 2017.  It was not  until  October  2017  that  the  Home
      Office wrote to their solicitors indicating that the outcomes would be
      implemented ([AB/155]).  By October 2018 when the Appellant's  husband
      applied for ILR, the appeal decision still had not  been  implemented.
      At that stage, the Appellant still benefitted from section  3C  leave.
      Had it not been for the Respondent's delay in implementing the  appeal
      decision, therefore, the Appellant would  have  been  granted  further
      leave which is likely still to  have  been  extant  when  her  husband
      sought to vary his leave and would not have left her in  the  position
      in which she found herself.

48.         Although, as I have already noted, there is no  explanation  why
      the application for the Appellant was not made at the same time as her
      husband's application for ILR, she was at that  time  advised  by  the
      same solicitors as were acting for her husband. I can only assume that
      they did not  realise  the  consequences  of  their  actions  and  the
      detriment which this would cause for the  Appellant.   Once  that  was
      apparently appreciated, she acted to seek to remedy it.  It is perhaps
      unfortunate that those advising her  did  not  accept  the  part  they
      played in her predicament and did not accept from the outset that  she
      had overstayed but with good reason  due  to  the  complexity  of  the
      immigration status position.  Nonetheless, that  this  was  a  complex
      history is evident from the previous  decisions  in  this  appeal.   I
      accept that the Appellant did act to remedy  the  situation  within  a
      reasonable time although that was not within a timescale  which  would
      have allowed the overstaying to be disregarded.

49.          I  accept  of  course  that  the   maintenance   of   effective
      immigration control is in the public interest and is favoured  by  not
      permitting those with no right to remain within the Rules to  stay  in
      the UK.  However, in this case, I do not consider that to be a  strong
      public interest.  That is in part due to the Respondent's contribution
      to the Appellant's situation by her  own  delay  in  implementing  the
      successful appeal decision and in part because of  the  complexity  of
      the immigration status position as a  result  of  that  failure.   The
      Appellant sought to regularise her position once it became clear  that
      she needed to do so.  Prior to that time, she  had  acted  within  the
      Rules.  She has admittedly overstayed as a result now for nearly three
      years but that  is  due  to  having  no  leave  at  the  time  of  her
      application and the consequence of  spending  time  since  seeking  to
      vindicate her position.

50.         Whilst the interference  caused  by  removal  of  the  Appellant
      would not have such significant impacts as to permit her to meet EX.1,
      there would still be impacts for her and her husband and child who are
      both British citizens.  The interference with their private and family
      lives would be harsh although not  significantly  so.   On  the  other
      hand, however, I do not consider the public interest to  be  a  strong
      factor in this case for the reasons I have explained above.  Balancing
      the one against  the  other,  I  have  reached  the  conclusion  that,
      although the case is finely balanced, the interference just  outweighs
      the public interest.  For that reason, the impact of  removal  on  the
      Appellant and her family is  unjustifiably  harsh  and  therefore  the
      decision to remove is disproportionate.

CONCLUSION

51.          Removal  of  the  Appellant  would  have  unjustifiably   harsh
      consequences for the Appellant and her family.  The decision to remove
      is therefore disproportionate and amounts to a  breach  of  section  6
      Human Rights Act 1998.  I therefore allow the appeal.


DECISION

The refusal of the Appellant's human rights claim breaches section  6  Human
Rights Act 1998.  I therefore allow the appeal.

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

BACKGROUND

1.          The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh.  She  is  the  spouse
      of Mr Razzak Hossain who is now settled in the UK.  She came to the UK
      as his dependent in 2012.  She appeals against the decision of  First-
      tier  Tribunal  Judge  Obhi  promulgated  on  29  October  2019  ("the
      Decision").  By the Decision,  the  Judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's
      appeal against the Respondent's decision dated 4  June  2019  refusing
      her human rights claim made in the context of an application for leave
      to remain as the spouse of Mr Hossain who had been granted  indefinite
      leave in October 2018.

2.          The Respondent refused the application because it is  said  that
      the Appellant did not have leave to remain after 21 November 2018 when
      a pending application was voided at her request.  The Appellant denies
      this.  The Respondent says that as the  Appellant  was  an  overstayer
      when she made the application which led to the decision  under  appeal
      (on 4 January 2019), paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM ("paragraph  EX.1")
      to the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")  applies.   The  Respondent
      refused the application on the basis that there are no  insurmountable
      obstacles to family life continuing  in  Bangladesh.   The  Respondent
      accepts that the requirements of the Rules other than in  relation  to
      immigration status are met.

3.          For reasons which I will come to later  in  this  decision,  the
      Judge  accepted  the  Respondent's  case  that   the   Appellant   had
      overstayed.  She did so notwithstanding an observation at [23] of  the
      Decision that it was "not entirely clear to [her] what happened on the
      21 November 2018".  Having found that the Appellant was an overstayer,
      she went on to consider paragraph EX.1 but found that  there  were  no
      insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Bangladesh.  She
      also considered whether it could be said that the Appellant was  bound
      to be granted entry clearance if she were to return to  Bangladesh  to
      make her application  (such  that  it  might  be  disproportionate  to
      require her to return to make that application).  She  concluded  that
      this was not certain and accordingly that the appeal did not  fall  to
      be allowed on this alternative basis.

4.          The Appellant appeals for a number of reasons as follows:
            (1)   The  Decision  is  unclear  because  the  reasoning  lacks
      details.
            (2)  The Judge has failed to  make  a  finding  on  the  central
      issue regarding the
            voiding of an application in November  2018,  as  to  which  the
           Respondent has failed to discharge her burden of proof.
      (3)   The Judge erred in her conclusion that  the  Appellant  did  not
           have section 3C leave when she made her application  in  January
           2019.
            (4)  Even if the Appellant did  overstay,  the  Judge  (and  the
      Respondent) failed to
            exercise discretion on the basis that the  overstaying  was  not
           lengthy and not deliberate.
      (5)   The Decision is therefore irrational.

5.          Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Martin
      (sitting as a First-tier Tribunal Judge)  on  14  April  2020  in  the
      following terms so far as relevant:

            "... 2.    It is arguable that the judge erred  in  finding  the
           appellant's application was  voided  in  November  2018  without
           evidence that this was so.  The judge stated that she was unsure
           what had happened in November and this was crucial to the  point
           whether the appellant had s.3C leave."

6.          By a Note and Directions sent on 12 May  2020,  having  reviewed
      the file, Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson  reached  the  provisional  view
      that it would be appropriate to determine without a hearing  (pursuant
      to Rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  -
      "the Procedure Rules") the following questions:
            (a)  whether the making of the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
           involved the making of an error of law and, if so
                 (b)   whether that decision should be set aside.
            Directions were given for the parties  to  make  submissions  in
      writing on the appropriateness of that course and further  submissions
      in relation to the  error  of  law.  The  reasons  for  the  Note  and
      Directions was the "present  need  to  take  precautions  against  the
      spread of Covid-19, and the  overriding  objective  expressed  in  the
      Procedure Rules".

7.          Neither party has filed submissions either as to  the  substance
      of the appeal or the forum for determining the  error  of  law  issue.
      However, for reasons which follow, I consider that I can determine the
      error of law issue on the papers based on  the  Decision  itself,  the
      grounds as pleaded and the documents before me (which  documents  were
      also before Judge Obhi).

8.          At this  stage,  the  issue  for  me  is  whether  the  Decision
      contains an error of law.  If I conclude it does, I need  to  consider
      whether I should set aside the Decision based on  that  error.   If  I
      decide to do so, I would either re-make  the  decision  or  remit  the
      appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

9.          The main focus of the grounds and indeed the appeal as  a  whole
      is the events prior to the making of the application which led to  the
      decision under appeal.  It is therefore appropriate to set  those  out
      in a little more detail.

10.         The Appellant's husband, Mr Hossain, came to  the  UK  initially
      as a student in October 2008.  He was later granted leave to remain as
      a Tier 1 Post-Study Migrant and then, in February 2012, as  a  Tier  2
      Migrant.  That latter leave was granted until 23  January  2015.   The
      Appellant entered the UK as a Tier 2 dependent of Mr Hossain in 2012.

11.         On 23 January 2015, Mr Hossain made an application  for  further
      leave to remain as  a  Tier  2  Migrant  with  the  Appellant  as  his
      dependent.  That application was refused on  9  December  2015  and  a
      decision was made to remove Mr Hossain and the Appellant on the  basis
      that Mr Hossain had cheated  in  an  English  language  test  and  had
      submitted a certificate with  his  2012  application  which  had  been
      obtained using a proxy test taker (in other  words,  this  was  a  so-
      called "ETS case").  Mr Hossain and the Appellant were given  a  right
      of appeal against the 9 December 2015 decision.  The 9  December  2015
      decision appears at [AB/163-168].

12.         The appeals of Mr Hossain and  the  Appellant  were  allowed  by
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Mr R G Walters in a decision promulgated  on
      17  July  2017  ([AB/158-162]).   The  Judge  accepted  that  the  ETS
      certificate had not been obtained by deception.   The  Respondent  did
      not appeal that decision.

13.         The effect of that decision is that  the  Respondent's  decision
      under appeal needed to be revisited.  Whilst not definitively reaching
      a conclusion as I do not  have  the  Respondent's  arguments  in  this
      regard, it seems to me that the position under Section 3C  Immigration
      Act 1971 ("Section 3C") is that  the  application  which  led  to  the
      successfully appealed decision is once again pending  and  that  leave
      therefore  continues  under  Section  3C  until  the  application   is
      redetermined.   It  appears  from  a  letter  dated  5  October   2017
      ([AB/155]) that the Respondent recognised that the  appeals  had  been
      allowed and proposed to implement  the  decision  (presumably  by  the
      grant of leave).  It is not clear what occurred subsequently  and  why
      some action was not taken in this regard (if it was not) by  the  time
      that Mr Hossain completed his ten years' lawful residence in the UK.

14.         One finds some  explanation  from  the  Respondent  during  that
      period recorded  in  the  Respondent's  submissions  at  [15]  of  the
      Decision as follows:

            "Ms Lambert invited me to dismiss the appeal.   Relying  on  the
           refusal letter she submitted that the decisions in the  case  of
           the husband were relevant, in that he had applied for  leave  to
           remain and it had been refused but on appeal the respondent  had
           to look at the decision again.  The  respondent  had  considered
           the point  and  issued  a  further  decision  stating  that  the
           certificate he had  provided  was  not  genuine.   Although  the
           respondent  had  not  appealed  against  the  decision  of   the
           Immigration  Judge  the  respondent  did  not  accept   it   and
           considered that there had been a material error of law  as  this
           was  not  a  genuine  vacancy.   He  then  did  not  pursue  the
           application and submitted one on the grounds of  long  residency
           which was granted.  The appellant could not  therefore  rely  on
           Section 3C as the decision which she had appealed was based on a
           situation which no longer prevailed.  The respondent had written
           to her on that basis and told her that she no longer had  extant
           leave and she would have to  leave  the  UK.   Had  his  earlier
           application continued she would have had leave under Section  3C
           of the Immigration Act.  However,  she  could  not  apply  as  a
           dependent on someone who has a settled status,  i.e.  she  could
           not say that she was dependent on someone who did not have leave
           to remain.  Her application was  frustrated  because  of  events
           relating to his application."

15.         Whilst I have no reason to  doubt  what  is  there  recorded  as
      representing the Respondent's  understanding  of  what  occurred,  the
      unfortunate fact is that there is no evidence about what  happened  in
      the period between October 2017 and October 2018  (and  January  2019)
      and the Respondent's decision letter under appeal is silent about  the
      chronology of the case at that time.  None of  the  correspondence  at
      that time between the  Respondent  and  Mr  Hossain/the  Appellant  is
      submitted by either party.

16.         It is no doubt as a result  of  the  evidential  void  that  the
      Judge was unclear as to the facts.   The Judge dealt with those  facts
      in her findings at [17] onwards of the Decision.  Having recorded  the
      parties' competing submissions at [17] of the Decision, she went on to
      find as follows:

            "18. I am satisfied that I cannot go  behind  a  decision  which
           has not been appealed or set aside.  I accordingly  accept  that
           the appeal of  the  appellant's  husband  on  which  she  was  a
           dependent was allowed.
            19.  However, if the husband's permission to remain  lapsed,  as
           the permission of the wife, the appellant was dependent  on  his
           application, it follows that her leave also expired.   The  only
           issue is whether, during the period between the husband's Tier 2
           leave coming to an end and him being granted indefinite leave to
           remain, the appellant had extant leave to remain in the UK under
           Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971."

17.         The Judge then set out Section 3C and continued as follows:

            "21. The appellant was given  leave  to  enter  the  UK  as  the
           spouse of a Tier 2 Migrant, and she did so  on  the  22  October
           2012.  She sought to vary that leave  in  August  2015  but  her
           application was refused on the  9  December  2015  and  was  the
           subject of an appeal to the Tribunal.  This appeal  was  allowed
           by Judge Walters.  The decision is produced in  the  appellant's
           bundle.  The appellant was a  dependent  on  that  appeal.   The
           respondent had refused the appeal as she was not satisfied  that
           the TOEIC certificate from ETS (confirming that the  appellant's
           husband had passed the  relevant  English  language  tests)  was
           reliable.  The respondent considered that the appellant had used
           a proxy speaker to  take  the  test.   The  respondent  was  not
           represented at the hearing before Judge Walters, who heard  from
           the appellant who was represented at the  hearing  and  accepted
           his evidence that he had not used a proxy speaker.   The  appeal
           was allowed on that point only, but there  was  a  second  issue
           which was not determined and that related to whether Certificate
           of Vacancy produced  by  the  appellant  related  to  a  genuine
           vacancy,  that  was  effectively  left  for  the  respondent  to
           determine.
            22.  I accept that up to the date of that decision,  namely  the
           17 June 2017, and until a decision was made by the respondent on
           the Tier 2 application in respect of the certificate of  vacancy
           was made, the leave under Section  3C  continued  for  both  the
           primary appellant (the appellant's husband) and  the  appellant,
           who was his dependent on that appeal.  The two ran together.  On
           the 5 October 2017 the decision had yet to be made, so the leave
           remained extant.  This is clear from  the  letter  dated  the  5
           October 2017, at page C9 of the respondent's bundle.
            23.  The respondent submits that an event  on  the  21  November
           2018 brought her leave to an end.  The respondent  describes  it
           as the appeal having been 'voided' - which cannot  be  right  as
           the appeal had been determined.  This is probably a reference to
           the appellant's husband deciding not to pursue  his  application
           under Tier 2.  Although it is not  entirely  clear  to  me  what
           happened  on  the  21  November  2018,  the  fact  is  that  the
           appellant's husband upon whom the appellant was dependent on his
           Tier 2 application had not pursued his application  for  further
           leave to remain.
            24.  Mr West invites me to find that the burden of proving  that
           the application had been voided rests with the respondent as she
           is the one who asserts it.   I  am  satisfied  on  the  evidence
           before me that some action was taken by the appellant's husband,
           it is likely to  have  been  his  decision  not  to  pursue  the
           application under Tier 1 on or around the 21 November 2018 which
           resulted  in  the  appellant's  leave  lapsing  alongside   that
           application.   The  appellant  did  not  have   a   freestanding
           application, it was  always  as  a  dependent  on  that  of  her
           husband, so once his leave, on  the  basis  upon  which  it  was
           applied for ended, so too did hers and the lave under Section 3C
           lapsed accordingly.
            25.  Even if the date of the 21 November 2018 is wrong, at  some
           point between the application of  the  appellant  for  leave  to
           remain as the dependent of a person with  settled  status  being
           made and her extant leave as the dependent of a Tier 2 dependent
           ending, there must have been a  gap.   In  other  words  if  her
           husband did not pursue an  application  upon  which  she  was  a
           dependent, then she could not be a dependent."
            [my emphasis]

18.         If the position is as the Respondent appears to suggest  and  Mr
      Hossain did indeed  abandon  his  earlier  application  on  which  the
      Appellant was dependent in favour of  an  application  which  did  not
      concern her, then the Respondent's position and the  Judge's  analysis
      may well hold good.   However,  the  difficulty  as  things  currently
      stand, is there is an evidential vacuum on both sides.  I  agree  with
      the submission made to Judge Obhi concerning  the  burden  of  proving
      what is said about Mr Hossain's application and status at the relevant
      times.  That is clearly on the  Respondent.   It  is  however  equally
      notable that Mr Hossain's statement is silent on the subject  of  what
      occurred at this important time and none of the  correspondence  other
      than the 5 October 2017 letter is included.  Both parties  were  aware
      of the central issue and owe a duty of candour to provide all relevant
      documentation.

19.         Nonetheless, for present purposes, I am satisfied that there  is
      an error of law in the Decision based on the Judge's  reasoning.   The
      erroneous approach begins at [19] of  the  Decision  where  the  Judge
      correctly identifies that  "if  the  husband's  permission  to  remain
      lapsed" then so would that of the Appellant.  However, that  begs  the
      question whether his leave had at any time  lapsed.   The  Judge  then
      accepts without any evidence and without Mr Hossain being asked  about
      this, that he had "decided not  to  pursue"  the  outstanding  Tier  2
      application and that, in consequence of his actions,  the  application
      on which the Appellant's leave depended had lapsed.  None of the facts
      submitted by Ms  Lambert  appear  to  have  any  underpinning  in  the
      evidence I have seen and nor does the Judge refer to any.  As such, it
      is difficult to see how the Judge could reach the conclusion  she  did
      that the Respondent had satisfied her that the Appellant's  leave  had
      either lapsed or the application had been somehow voided. The findings
      made  are  speculative  and  without  evidential  foundation  (as  the
      position currently stands).

20.         For those reasons, it is appropriate to set aside the  Decision.
       The questions of the Appellant's and Mr Hossain's leave, whether that
      had indeed lapsed at any time, and whether the Appellant was  in  fact
      an overstayer are central to her ability to succeed  in  this  appeal.
      The decision therefore needs to be re-made. The findings  are  however
      quite narrow, and it is appropriate  to  retain  the  appeal  in  this
      Tribunal for that purpose.

21.         Given what I say above about the lack of evidence on both  sides
      concerning the events between the allowing of the appeal in  2017  and
      the Appellant's application in January 2019, I have  given  directions
      below for further evidence to be provided as to those events prior  to
      the hearing to re-make the decision.  Since it may be  the  case  that
      further oral  evidence  is  required  from  the  Appellant  and/or  Mr
      Hossain, I have directed that the hearing proceed on a  face  to  face
      basis.  If the parties are content however for evidence  to  be  given
      remotely (provided an interpreter is not required) or if oral evidence
      is not required, the parties may request a remote hearing.


DECISION

I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Obhi
promulgated on 29 October 2019 discloses an error of law.  I set aside  that
decision.  I make the following directions for a resumed hearing:

DIRECTIONS
   1. Within 28  days  from  the  date  when  this  decision  is  sent,  the
      Respondent shall file with the Tribunal and  serve  on  the  Appellant
      evidence relating to the immigration position of Mr  Hossain  and  the
      Appellant between the allowing of their appeals on 17  July  2017  and
      the making of the Appellant's application on 4 January 2019 to include
      all notes on CID which are  relevant  to  that  time  period  and  all
      correspondence passing  between  the  Respondent  and  Mr  Hossain/the
      Appellant and/or their representatives.
   2. Within 28 days from the service of the  evidence  in  [1]  above,  the
      Appellant is to file with the Tribunal and serve on the Respondent any
      further evidence on which she relies.
   3. The appeal is to be relisted for a hearing at Field House on a face to
      face basis with a time estimate of � day.  If the  Appellant  requires
      an interpreter for herself or any of her witnesses, she is  to  notify
      the Tribunal within 14 days from the sending of this decision.
   4. The parties are at liberty to apply to amend these directions,  giving
      reasons, if they face significant practical difficulties in complying.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Khan, Counsel, instructed by Reza Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                     ADJOURNMENT DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

    1. The Appellant appealed against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Obhi promulgated on 29 October 2019 dismissing the Appellant's
       appeal on human rights grounds  ("the  Decision").   By  a  decision
       dated 25 August 2020, made under Rule 34 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 on the papers  and  without  a  hearing,
       Judge Smith  found  an  error  of  law  in  the  Decision  and  gave
       directions for a resumed hearing before this Tribunal  and  for  the
       filing  of  further  evidence.   Unfortunately,  Ms  Cunha  had  not
       received the error of law decision and was under the misapprehension
       that the hearing before us was at error  of  law  stage.   For  that
       reason and for ease of reference, we have appended the error of  law
       decision to this decision.


    2. Ms Cunha indicated in response to a question from us, that  she  did
       not seek to reopen the error of law decision on the  basis  that  it
       had been made on the papers (in light of the recent judgment in JCWI
       v The President  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  (IAC)  [2020]  EWHC  3103
       (Admin)).


    3. In response to Judge Smith's earlier directions, the  Appellant  has
       filed an additional bundle of evidence (on 30 October 2020).  Again,
       unfortunately, Ms Cunha had not received that.  Nor had any  further
       evidence been filed by the Respondent although Ms Cunha did  attempt
       to overcome that difficulty by the filing of a chronology.

    4. In any event, as we indicated at the hearing, there remains scant if
       any evidence of what occurred at the times which are material to the
       issue in this case, namely  whether  the  Appellant  has  been  (and
       remains) an overstayer.

    5. Since the Decision and the grounds of appeal, the Appellant and  her
       husband have had a child.  The Appellant's husband is now a  British
       citizen and the child is also a British citizen.  Ms Cunha indicated
       that, in light of that development, the  Respondent  would  like  to
       have the opportunity to reconsider the decision under appeal and  to
       consider whether the Appellant ought to be granted leave to remain.

    6. Various options were discussed to that end.  As both representatives
       agreed, it would not be appropriate for the Respondent  to  withdraw
       her decision under appeal and for  the  Appellant  to  withdraw  her
       appeal.  The Respondent's decision is made on the premise  that  the
       Appellant was an overstayer when she made the application leading to
       the decision under appeal and would remain  an  overstayer  in  that
       event which may have an impact on any reconsideration.

    7. Ms Cunha accepted that the Tribunal could consider  for  itself  the
       impact of the birth of the child following the  Tribunal's  decision
       in Birch (Precariousness and mistake: new matters:  Jamaica)  [2020]
       UKUT 86 (IAC).  However, she submitted  that  the  Tribunal  may  be
       assisted by the Respondent's view and in any event,  the  Respondent
       might be minded to grant leave to remain in which case time would be
       wasted by proceeding with the  hearing  before  us.   She  suggested
       therefore that the appeal hearing be adjourned  in  order  to  allow
       reconsideration to take place.  Mr Khan agreed with that course.

    8. We too considered it a sensible  option  and  in  the  interests  of
       justice, not least because it would then allow the parties  to  file
       the  evidence  (if  necessary)  which  was  sought  by  the  earlier
       directions.  We have therefore provided  again  for  the  filing  of
       further evidence in the event that the  Respondent  does  not  grant
       leave to remain following reconsideration.  The directions  made  in
       that regard are in order to  ascertain  what  occurred  between  the
       making of  the  Appellant's  husband's  application  based  on  long
       residence on 26 October 2018 and  the  refusal  of  the  Appellant's
       application on 4 June 2019.

    9. If, as Mr Khan suggested may be the position, the Appellant remained
       a dependent on her  husband's  application  or  was  entitled  to  a
       decision in her own right  on  the  earlier  application  which  was
       before the Respondent for reconsideration, then it may be  that  she
       did not overstay at all.

   10. On the other hand, if the effect of the making  of  the  Appellant's
       husband's application on 26 October 2018 was  to  vary  the  Tier  2
       application which was pending reconsideration at that time  (and  on
       which the Appellant was definitely  a  dependent)  but  without  the
       Appellant being a dependent on that later application, the effect of
       the application varying the earlier application may well be to  void
       the earlier application with a potential impact on  the  Appellant's
       status.   We directed Mr Khan's attention to a letter  at  [177]  of
       the Respondent's bundle from the Home Office Charging Team dated  19
       December 2018 refunding an application fee  of  �601  in  connection
       with application number PP5504001668/001.  That may suggest that the
       Respondent had treated as withdrawn the pending Tier 2  application.



   11. We make clear however that we have not reached any firm view  as  to
       which of the above (or indeed any other) scenarios apply, not  least
       because, as we say, we do not have the evidence on  which  we  could
       determine those facts.


    DIRECTION


    1. By Monday 1 February 2021, the Respondent is to reconsider the
       Appellant's case and communicate any further decision to her (filing
       a copy of any such decision with the Tribunal).


    2. In the event that the Respondent does not provide a further decision
       by that date or, by her reconsidered decision, does not grant the
       Appellant leave to remain, the parties shall, by 4pm on Monday 15
       February 2021, file the following evidence with the Tribunal and
       serve it on the other party:
       (a)  From the Respondent: a full copy of the CID records in relation
       to the Appellant and the Appellant's husband, Mr Razzak Hossain;
       (b)  From the Appellant and the Respondent: a copy of the
       application made by the Appellant's husband on 26 October 2018 with
       any covering letter;
       (c)  From the Appellant and the Respondent: all and any
       correspondence passing between the Home Office, and the Appellant,
       the Appellant's husband and/or the solicitors for the Appellant and
       the Appellant's husband in the period 26 October 2018 to 4 June
       2019.


    3. The appeal will be  listed  for  a  resumed  hearing  on  the  first
       available date after Monday 1 March 2021 before UTJ Smith.


    4. The parties are at liberty to apply to vary these directions, giving
       reasons,  if  they  face  significant  practical   difficulties   in
       complying.

    5. Documents or submissions filed in response to these  directions  may
       be sent by, or attached to, an email to [email] using the Tribunal's
       reference number (found at the  top  of  these  directions)  as  the
       subject line.  Attachments must not exceed 15 MB.  This  address  is
       not generally available for the filing of documents.


    6. Service on the Secretary of State may  be  to  [email]  and  to  the
       Appellant, in the absence of any contrary instruction, by use of any
       address apparent from the service of these directions.
