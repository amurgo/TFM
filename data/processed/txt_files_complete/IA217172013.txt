                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Davies promulgated on 13th November 2013.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born 23rd March 1990 who applied
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    Migrant.

 3. The application was refused on 21st May 2013, the Respondent  making  a
    combined decision to refuse to vary leave to remain, and to remove  the
    Appellant from the United Kingdom.

 4. The Respondent refused the  application  with  reference  to  paragraph
    245ZX(c) of the Immigration Rules, not accepting that the Appellant was
    entitled to be awarded 30  points  for  attributes  under  Appendix  A.
    Refusal was based upon the  fact  that  in  accordance  with  paragraph
    118(b)(ii)(1) to (4)  the  Appellant  needed  to  provide  an  original
    English  language  test  certificate  from  an  English  language  test
    provider approved  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   The  Appellant  had
    provided three TOEIC certificates from the Educational Testing  Service
    (ETS).  The Respondent contended that the Appellant needed to show  the
    required minimum scores for the reading and listening components on one
    certificate of the same date, as  well  as  the  speaking  and  writing
    components on one certificate of  the  same  date,  to  show  that  the
    Appellant  had  achieved  or  exceeded  CEFR  level  B2  in  all   four
    components.  The Respondent would  not  accept  the  TOEIC  certificate
    dated 16th January 2013 which only showed the speaking  score  and  not
    the writing score.  Therefore the Appellant had not proved that he  had
    achieved CEFR level B2 in all four components  of  listening,  reading,
    speaking, and writing.

 5. The Appellant appealed contending that there was no justification given
    by the Respondent for rejecting  the  TOEIC  certificate  and  had  not
    referred to any Immigration Rule which prohibited submitting more  than
    one certificate.

 6. Judge Davies (the  judge)  determined  the  appeal  on  the  papers  as
    requested by the Appellant.  The judge dismissed the appeal finding  no
    evidence to show that the Appellant had obtained the minimum score  for
    reading, listening, speaking and writing on the same date.

 7. The Appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal contending in summary that
    the Appellant had provided TOEIC certificates from an approved  English
    language test provider, and that there was nothing in  the  Immigration
    Rules which required the Appellant to sit all of  the  examinations  on
    the same date.  The combination of the three certificates  proved  that
    the Appellant had achieved level B2 of the CEFR and his  appeal  should
    have been allowed.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Grant-Hutchison in the following terms;

         "It is an arguable error of law that the judge misdirected  himself
         when he finds that the Appellant  failed  to  provide  certificates
         showing  the  same  date  as  evidence  of  his  English   language
         requirement when he  produced  a  certificate  for  speaking  on  a
         different  date  when  there  is  arguably  nothing  specified   in
         paragraph 118(b)(ii)(1-4) of Appendices A and O either at the  date
         of application (1st March 2013) or in the particular  circumstances
         of this appeal as at the date of decision (21st May 2013)  for  the
         scores to be achieved in  all  the  relevant  components  during  a
         single sitting.  (The rules were changed on 1st October 2013).  The
         date of the certificate for speaking is dated 16th January 2013."

 9. The Tribunal issued directions that there should be  a  hearing  before
    the Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    erred in law such that the decision should be set aside.

The Tribunal Hearing

10. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Harrison conceded that the  refusal  was
    incorrect  and  that  the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    contained a material error of law.  It was accepted that  the  decision
    should be set aside and either found to be not in accordance  with  the
    law, which would mean that the decision would be outstanding before the
    Secretary of State for a lawful decision to  be  made,  or  remade  and
    allowed by the Upper Tribunal.  Mr Malik submitted that the appropriate
    course of action was to  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and for the Upper Tribunal to remake the  decision  and  allow
    the appeal.  Mr Harrison accepted that the appeal should be allowed.

My Conclusions and Reasons

11. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  I  conclude  that
    the Respondent's refusal was incorrect.  There was no prohibition  when
    the refusal was  made,  on  the  Appellant  submitting  more  than  one
    certificate to prove his English  language  ability.   The  rules  were
    subsequently changed on 1st October 2013.

12. The judge erred in finding  that  there  was  such  a  requirement  and
    therefore the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

13. It is conceded on behalf of the Respondent that the  appeal  should  be
    allowed.  I conclude that  the  Appellant  provided  evidence  that  he
    satisfied level B2 of the CEFR and the Respondent's  decision  refusing
    his application is not in accordance with the law and  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The application should have been granted.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.



Signed                              Date 19th June 2014

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge M A Hall
TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeal is allowed.  I therefore make a fee award  in  the  sum  of  ï¿½80.
The Appellant provided evidence  that  he  satisfied  the  English  language
requirement to the Respondent.
