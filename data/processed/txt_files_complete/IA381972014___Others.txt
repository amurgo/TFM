                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellants. Having considered all the circumstances and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this  appeal  but
    in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert promulgated  on
    12 February 2015 which allowed the Appellant's appeal  to  the  limited
    extent that it was remitted to the  Secretary  of  State  for  a  fresh
    decision to be made.

Background

 3. The first Appellant was born on 25 January 1987 and is  a  national  of
    India. The other Appellants are her  husband  and  child  who  are  her
    dependents in this appeal. I shall refer throughout  this  decision  to
    'the Appellant' meaning the first Appellant.

 4. On 24 January 2014 the Appellant  applied for leave to remain in the UK
    as a Tier 1(Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based System

 5. On 5 September 2014 the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application and made directions for her  removal  under  s  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 6. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:

    (a)    The Appellant did not provide the specified evidence required by
         paragraph 41-SD(d)(ii) to establish that she had access to funds as
         required.

    (b)    The Appellant claimed access to ï¿½50,000 funds in  her  own  name
         but does not satisfy the requirements of  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)-
         (iv) as she failed to provide the required evidence  to  show  that
         her business was actively trading nor did she provide the  business
         bank letter or statements as required by 41-SD(e)(vii)(2).

    (c)    The Appellant therefore could  not  be  awarded  the  25  points
         claimed for Attributes.

    (d)    The remaining points claimed based on funds  (50  points)  could
         also not be awarded.

The Judge's Decision

 7. The Appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  appeared  in
    person. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert  ("the  Judge")  allowed  the
    appeal against the Respondent's decision to the limited extent that  it
    was remitted to the Respondent for a lawful decision to be made.

 8. The Judge found :

      a) That the Appellant was not relying on third party funding  but  was
         relying on the funds held in her name.

      b) The Respondent asserted that the Appellant had not provided

          I. advertising material covering a continuous  period  commencing
             before 11/7/2014( 41-SD(e)(iii)(1)

         II. a contract for services  which  showed  the  duration  of  the
             contract (41-SD(e)(iv)(1)(d)

        III. business bank statements or a properly headed bank letter (41-
             SD(e) (vii)(2)

      c) The Appellant's application was made on 24 July 2014.

      d) The Appellant asserted that the requirements listed  at  (b)  above
         were not in force at the time of her application.

      e) The Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  researched  the  content  of
         paragraph 41-SD(e) as it was between 1-27 July 2014. Sub  paragraph
         9e)(iii) at that time contained no  requirement  for  documents  to
         cover a continuous period commencing before 11 July  2014  and  the
         requirement in relation to bank statements (subparagraph (vii)  was
         not in force at he date of application.

      f) The Home Office Presenting Officer did not  seek  to  rely  on  the
         duration of the contract point.

      g) The Respondent had therefore relied on the  wrong  version  of  the
         Rules and was unlawful and should be remitted for a lawful decision



 9. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that :

      a) At the time of the application and refusal paragraph 41-SD (e)(iii)
         of Appendix A contained a requirement  for  documents  to  cover  a
         continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014.

      b) At the time of the application and the refusal paragraph 412-SD (e)
         (vii) was in force.

      c) These requirements were brought into effect  by  the  Statement  of
         Changes in the Immigration Rules HC532 dated 10 July 2014.

10. On 1 April 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Andrew  gave  permission  to
    appeal.

11. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Mc Vitie on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent  that :

      a) The Rules are very complex.

      b) The Home Office Presenting Officer made a mistake in conceding that
         the wrong version of the rules had been applied in the decision.

      c) Paragraph 37 of HC532 states that the effective date of change  was
         10 July 2014 to an application made on 24 July 2014.

12. On behalf of the Appellant  Ms Patel submitted that :

      a) The error that was made was not material  to  the  outcome  of  the
         decision.

      b) In relation to the advertising material paragraph 41-SD (e)(iii) of
         Appendix A required that the documents covered a continuous  period
         commencing before 11 July 2014. The Appellant's  witness  statement
         mentioned that there was advertising on Gumtree from 9 July 2014 to
         the date of the application (page 64-5 of the bundle)  which  taken
         together with the letters from Gumtree at page 49  onwards  of  the
         bundle showed that the Appellant had advertised  for  a  continuous
         period prior to the date of application.

      c)  In relation to the requirement for a contract for  services  which
         showed  the  duration  of  the  contract  it  was  clear  from  the
         Appellant's witness statement that the contract  was  signed  on  2
         July 2014 and the Appellant could not have foreseen that the  Rules
         would change after the contract was  signed.  Fairness  would  have
         required the Appellant to be given the  opportunity  to  provide  a
         contract that met  a  change  in  the  Rules  she  could  not  have
         anticipated.

      d) In relation to the requirement of paragraph 41-SD(e) (vii)(2) there
         was evidence before the decision maker at page 45 of a bank account
         being opened by the Appellant . There were also bank statements for
         that account at pages 39-44 .

      e) At the time of the application the Guidance that was in  force  was
         the the April Guidance; no new Guidance was issued until after  the
         date of application. The Judge would therefore have still  remitted
         the case to  give  the  Appellant  the  opportunity  to  provide  a
         contract in accordance with the requirements that came  into  force
         after her contract was signed.

      f) The changes in issue  literally  came  into  force  over  nigh  and
         applicants were not given the usual 21 days notice: again this  was
         an issue of fairness.

13. In reply Mr Mc Vitie submitted on behalf of  the  Respondent  submitted
    that :

      a) The rules are the Rules.

      b) The Appellant had still  not  provided  a  contract  that  met  the
         requirements.

      c) The email from the bank did not meet the requirements of the  Rules
         which was for a letter from the bank on its headed paper.

Finding on Material Error

14. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made material errors of law.

15. I am satisfied that the Judge made an  error  of  law  relying  on  the
    concession of the Home Office Presenting Officer that the wrong version
    of the evidential requirements of the Rules had  been  applied  in  the
    Refusal Letter. HC 532 brought the changes in issue into effect  on  11
    July 2014.

16. Mr Mc Vitie provided a copy of HC 532 and in relation to paragraph 421-
    SD(e) (iii) I am satisfied that the requirement in paragraph 37  of  HC
    532 for advertising material 'covering a continuous  period  commencing
    before 11/7/2014 up to no earlier than 3 months before the date of  the
    application was to take effect under the heading of  Implementation  on
    11 July 2014. Thus they applied to the Appellant's application.

17. I have considered whether this was material to the outcome on the basis
    of Ms Patels argument  that  in  fact  the  Appellant  could  meet  the
    requirements of this provision. Ms Patel argues that there was material
    in the Appellant's statement and from Gumtree to show advertising for a
    continuous period prior to date of application. I am satisfied that the
    evidence before the Judge did not lead  to  only  one  conclusion:  the
    Gumtree  emails  at  pages  49-52  merely  refer  to  the  removal   of
    advertising material as it had  been  posted  in  the  wrong  place  on
    Gumtree .  The  letter  relied  on  at  page  64  is  an  advertisement
    apparently posted 3 hours prior to the date of the printout  which  was
    23 July 2014 that is the day before the Appellant's application.  I  am
    satisfied that had the Judge appreciated that the  correct  version  of
    the Rules was contained within the refusal letter she would  have  made
    findings as to whether the evidence before her met  those  requirements
    and the conclusion urged by Ms Patel was not inevitable .  The  failure
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  address  and  determine  this  issue
    constitutes a clear error of law. This error I consider to be  material
    since had the Tribunal conducted this exercise the outcome  could  have
    been different.

18. In relation to the rejection of the contract between the Appellant  and
    Ultimate Brow Bar because there  was  no  clear  duration  of  contract
    period shown it is unclear and indeed not recorded why the Home  Office
    Presenting Officer stated that she did not seek to pursue  that  point.
    The provision was certainly in force as it appears at paragraph  38  of
    HC 352 and its implementation date was again 11 July 2014. The  failure
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  address  and  determine  this  issue
    constitutes a clear error of law as again I see no inevitability  about
    the acceptance that this was unfair and  both  sides  should  have  the
    opportunity to address this on the basis  that  the  provision  was  in
    force. This error I consider to be  material  since  had  the  Tribunal
    conducted this exercise the outcome could have been different.

19. In relation to the  bank  evidence  requirements  these  are  found  in
    paragraph 39 of HC 352 and again were in force on 11 July 2014  so  the
    Judge was in error to find that they  had  been  wrongly  applied.  The
    requirement read:

         "if the applicant is currently a director, a company bank statement
         showing that the company has a United Kingdom account, or a  letter
         from a  United  Kingdom-regulated  financial  institution,  on  the
         institutions headed paper, confirming that the company has  a  bank
         account and the applicant is a signatory of that account."

20. The Judge had before her material that arguably  met  that  requirement
    but I do not accept that the Judge would have inevitably  reached  that
    conclusion. There was no bank letter in headed notepaper only an email.
    There is no reference  to  the  Appellant  being  a  signatory  to  the
    account.  The  failure  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  address  and
    determine this issue constitutes a clear error of  law  .This  error  I
    consider to be material since had the Tribunal conducted this  exercise
    the outcome could have been different.

21. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that the
    Judge's determination cannot  stand  and  must  be  set  aside  in  its
    entirety. All matters to be redetermined afresh.

22. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal Practice  Statement
    of the 25th of September 2012 the case may be  remitted  to  the  First
    Tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

         (a)      the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
         the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity  for
         that party's case to be put to and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or

         (b)      the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

23. In this case I have determined that the case should be remitted because
    the judge made no findings about the evidence before her having wrongly
    decided that the wrong version of the Rules had been  applied  in  this
    case.

24. I consequently remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal sitting
    at Manchester to be heard on a date to be fixed before me.
