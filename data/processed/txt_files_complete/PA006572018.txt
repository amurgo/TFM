                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  to  the  Upper Tribunal,
brought with the permission of a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal,  from  a
decision of the First-tier Tribunal ("the tribunal") which it sent  to  the
parties on 21 February 2018; whereupon it allowed  the  claimant's  appeal
against the Secretary of State's decision of 29 December 2017, to refuse to
grant him international protection.

2.    The claimant was granted anonymity by the tribunal.  Nothing was  said
about that before  me  but,  in  those  circumstances,  I  have  decided  to
maintain the status quo and to continue the grant of anonymity.

3.    The claimant, who was born on 29 December 1990,  is  a  national  of
Afghanistan and a  Sikh.   He  lived  much  of  his  life  in  Jalalabad  in
Afghanistan prior to coming to the United Kingdom (UK).  He claims to  have
left Afghanistan in early July 2017 and he entered the  UK,  clandestinely,
on 5 August 2017.  It is recorded that he claimed asylum on 6 August 2017.
His wife (whom I shall refer to as "GK" in order to preserve  anonymity)  is
a dependant upon his claim and his appeal.

4.    The account the claimant offered in seeking  international  protection
may be summarised as follows: He previously resided in Jalalabad as did  his
brother and his parents.  He used to work in a shop  owned  by  his  father.
Local people of the Muslim faith would mock him.  There have been  occasions
when he has been assaulted by members of Muslim  population.   Approximately
one month prior to his  leaving  Afghanistan  both  he  and  his  wife  were
assaulted.  The two of them left Afghanistan with  his  father.  His  father
had  generated  money  for  the  journey  through  selling  his  shop  to  a
trafficker and through selling some jewellery. The couple  became  separated
from the claimant's father  during  the  course  of  the  journey.   If  the
claimant is to be returned to  Afghanistan  with  his  wife,  they  will  be
subjected to what will amount to persecution on the  basis  of  their  being
followers of the Sikh faith.

5.     The  Secretary  of  State  acknowledged  that  life  for   Sikhs   in
Afghanistan is difficult.  But whilst  accepting  that  the  claimant  is  a
national of Afghanistan and a Sikh, he did not  believe  that  he  had  been
persecuted by Muslims in Afghanistan.  He also thought  that,  even  if  the
claimant was at risk in Jalalabad, he would be able to take advantage of  an
internal flight alternative.  So, he refused the application.

6.    The claimant appealed.  His appeal was dealt with by way  of  an  oral
hearing which took place on 22 February 2018.  Both the claimant  and  his
wife gave evidence.  Both parties were represented.  The tribunal, like  the
Secretary of State, disbelieved  the  account  the  claimant  had  given  of
persecution and beatings at the hands of members of the  Muslim  population.
But the  tribunal,  following  what  had  been  said  in  TG  (Afghan  Sikhs
persecuted) (CG) [2015 UKUT 595 accepted that whilst Sikhs were not at risk
on the basis of their faith per se, members  of  that  community  would  be
likely to face difficulties living in Afghanistan.  As to what the  claimant
and his wife might face if returned there, the tribunal  made  a  number  of
relevant findings.  It found that neither of them had any  family  links  in
Kabul (paragraph 95 of the written reasons).  It found that existing  Sikhs
still in Afghanistan (and the background material shows that there  are  few
of them remaining) would be likely to  prioritise  their  own  relatives  if
they had any jobs to offer.  It found that Muslims were  unlikely  to  offer
employment  opportunities  to  Sikhs  and  that  unless  capital  exists  to
purchase  a  property  for  business  purposes  (Sikhs  traditionally  being
persons who have run their own  businesses  in  Afghanistan),  it  would  be
difficult for Sikhs to set up in business because Muslims would  come  under
pressure from religious zealots not to rent business premises to  them.  See
(see paragraph 111 of the written reasons).  It found that the claimant was
accompanied by his father when he left Afghanistan but that his  father  had
became separated from him and his wife (see paragraphs 112, 113 and 115  of
the written reasons).  It found that the claimant did not  have  capital  or
premises which he could use to trade and it found (at least by  implication)
that the necessary payment to a people trafficker  had  left  him  short  of
resources (paragraph 115 of  the  written  reasons).   It  found  that  any
financial assistance which might be available to the claimant  in  the  form
of a package to assist with resettlement in  Afghanistan  would  not  enable
him to set up a  business  (see  paragraph 116  of  the  written  reasons).
Putting everything together, it found that  the  claimant  would  experience
conditions which would amount to persecution if he were to  be  returned  to
Jalalabad.  It also found that it would be unduly harsh to require  him  and
his wife to internally relocate to Kabul.  That was, essentially as  I  read
it, because they would face the same sorts of problems in Kabul  which  they
would face in Jalalabad with respect to what  would  amount  to  destitution
(see paragraph 159 of the written reasons).

7.    The tribunal's decision to allow the appeal was not  the  end  of  the
matter because the Secretary of State applied for, and obtained,  permission
to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The  refreshingly  succinct,  clear  and
straightforward  grounds  of  appeal  contained  these  propositions:    The
tribunal had rejected the claimant's contention that he had been  persecuted
and had left as a result of that persecution.  It had also found  that  with
respect to humanitarian protection the claimant would not be at risk  simply
as  a  result  of  his  presence  in  Afghanistan  for   the   purposes   of
Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive.  Despite  that  the  tribunal
had allowed the appeal because it thought he would not be able  to  lead  an
economically viable life in Afghanistan and that  any  resettlement  payment
available to him would  be  insufficient  for  him  to  set  himself  up  in
business and to enable him to find  accommodation.   But  the  tribunal  had
simply asserted such a package would be insufficient without reasoning  that
out.  That was an error of law.  Further, the tribunal had  erred  in  going
on  to  consider  whether  the  claimant  could   relocate   to   Kabul   in
circumstances where it had effectively concluded that he  would  not  be  at
risk in his home area. The implication was that, on its findings, it  should
have concluded he was not at risk of persecution in Jalalabad so he was  not
a refugee.

8.    The granting Judge relevantly said this:

    "1.    ... the judge found for many and varied reasons open to  him  on
    the evidence that the appellant had not been  ill-treated  by  Muslims.
    The judge was  seemingly  influenced  towards  his  decision  that  the
    appellant was a  refugee  by  his  finding  that  upon  his  return  to
    Afghanistan he would not have capital and premises so as to be able  to
    establish a business and that such a difficulty would be compounded  by
    his illiteracy (paragraph 114 of the judge's decision).   The  judge's
    finding  was  arguably   irrational.    That   prospect   of   economic
    vulnerability which the judge found arguably fell short of  that  level
    of malignance and persistence which is the essence of persecution.  The
    judge  was  arguably  influenced  by  irrelevant  considerations   when
    considering whether the appellant could settle in Kabul (paragraph 159
    of the  judge's  decision).   Given  the  judge's  finding  as  to  the
    appellant's lack of credibility it  was  arguably  irresistibly  to  be
    inferred that the appellant could return to his home area of  Jalalabad
    and the judge's assessment of the appellant's claim to be exposed to  a
    well-founded fear of persecution should arguably have  ended  with  the
    finding that the  appellant  could  safely  return  to  and  settle  in
    Jalalabad.  The application for permission is granted."

9.    Permission  having  been  granted  there  was  a  hearing  before  the
Upper Tribunal (before me) to facilitate a consideration as to  whether  or
not the tribunal had erred in law.  Representation was as stated  above  and
I am grateful to each representative.

10.   I have concluded that the tribunal did not err for any of the  reasons
it is argued it did in the grounds or for any of  the  reasons  that  it  is
suggested it might have done in the grant of  permission.   The  consequence
of that is that the decision of the tribunal stands.  I  shall  now  explain
my reasoning.

11.   The implication in the grant of permission is to the effect  that  the
tribunal's decision to allow the  appeal  on  asylum  grounds  was  prompted
solely by  considerations  of  an  economic  nature.   I  do  not  read  the
tribunal's decision in that way  and  I  do  not  think  that  that  implied
proposition is correct.  It is certainly true that the tribunal  did  think,
though it did not use  this  word,  that  the  claimant  was  likely  to  be
destitute  upon  return.   It  effectively  concluded  he  would  not   have
available funds to support himself, and would not be able to set himself  up
in business so as to  support  himself,  and  would  not  be  able  to  find
employment such as to generate an income to support himself.   Nor,  indeed,
to support his wife.

12.   It was, in my judgment, and in light of what is said in  TG,  open  to
the tribunal to reach  those  conclusions  for  the  reasons  it  gave.   In
particular,  it  was  entitled  to  find  that  the  claimant's  family  had
effectively sold their assets in order to finance  the  journey  outside  of
Afghanistan.  It was entitled, in light of what was said in TG, to  conclude
that the claimant would not be employed by members of the Muslim  population
and that members of that population were  unlikely  to  rent  any  potential
business premises to him.  As to  the  contention  in  the  grounds  that  a
relocation package of up to �1,500.00 per  person  would  be  sufficient  to
enable the claimant to set up in business, I have not been  able  to  detect
any evidence to indicate precisely what amount  of  money  would  have  been
paid in this case by way of such a package nor, more importantly,  how  much
might be needed to enable an otherwise destitute couple  to  set  themselves
up in Jalalabad or Kabul in a  way  which  would  obviate  destitution.   Of
course, if a person were to return with  insufficient  funds  to  set  up  a
business and was otherwise unable to generate  an  income  or  benefit  from
family support, then in due course those funds would become  dissipated  and
destitution would, in all probability, result.

13.   Without any specific evidence as  to  how  much  might  be  reasonably
needed, it was open to the tribunal to reach its own view as  to  whether  a
relocation package was likely to be sufficient or  not.   That  is  what  it
did.  But importantly, it was not,  on  my  reading  of  its  decision,  the
simple matter of economic  difficulty  which  caused  it  to  recognise  the
claimant as being a refugee.  It is true  that  the  tribunal  rejected  the
specific allegations of persecution or harassment  which  the  claimant  had
put to it.  It was certainly entitled to do that for the  reasons  it  gave.
But, following what  was  said  in  TG,  it  accepted  that  Muslim  zealots
continue to harass some members of the Sikh community  in  Afghanistan.   It
effectively accepted, following what was said in TG,  that  Sikhs  might  be
excluded  from  accessing  accommodation  or  pursuing   their   traditional
pursuits of a shopkeeper or trader (and TG suggests that for most  Sikhs  in
Afghanistan  there  are  no  other  available   means   of   maintaining   a
livelihood).  It found, in effect, that this claimant in his  circumstances,
would encounter treatment as a Sikh in Afghanistan which would  involve  the
denial of an opportunity to financially  maintain  himself  and  his  family
against a backdrop of discrimination because he is a Sikh, and that that  in
its totality would amount to  persecution.   I  would  readily  accept  that
differently constituted tribunal's might have reach a different view on  the
same facts.  But it seems to me that that view was open to the tribunal  and
that, in finding as it did,  it  was  not  simply  basing  its  decision  on
general economic vulnerability or difficulty.  I do not  accept,  therefore,
that its decision was irrational.  Further, the tribunal  was  not  finding,
as the grant of permission seems to suggest, that the claimant could  return
to his home area of Jalalabad.  What it was finding,  as  is  apparent  when
the written reasons are read as a whole,  is  that  he  could  not  do  that
because of the treatment he would  face  as  a  Sikh  which  would  lead  to
effective destitution.

14.   Turning to the other points made in the grounds,  since  the  tribunal
had effectively found that the claimant could not  return  to  Jalalabad  it
was required to consider whether or not  he  could  internally  relocate  to
Kabul.  It did that. It is  not  right  to  say,  as  is  suggested  in  the
grounds, that the tribunal found that the appellant and his father  did  not
become separated whilst travelling from Afghanistan to  the  UK.   In  fact,
insofar as that is a relevant consideration, the tribunal, although  it  did
not word its reasoning perfectly, does seem to have accepted  that,  to  the
lower standard, there had been such  a  separation.   I  have  in  mind  the
closing  sentence  of  paragraph 113  of   its   written   reasons.    Its
consideration as to return  to  Kabul  was  brief.   But,  in  view  of  the
findings it had already made, it was entitled, when it came to  assess  that
matter as it did at paragraph 159 of its  written  reasons,  to  take  into
account, with respect to reasonableness of relocation, the  difficulties  it
accepted he would have in making a living.  It is hard to see  how  internal
flight could reasonably be expected given what the  tribunal  clearly  found
to be an inability on the part of the claimant to support  himself  and  his
wife. It was certainly open to the tribunal to  conclude,  with  respect  to
internal flight, that it was not viable.

15.   I did  wonder  whether  the  tribunal's  assessment  might  have  been
incomplete because it did not make any  specific  findings  as  to  whether,
either in Jalalabad or Kabul, the claimant would be able to  access  support
from a Gurdwara.  However, it is recognised in TG,  to  which  the  tribunal
clearly had careful  regard,  that  the  ability  of  Gurdwaras  to  provide
support  is  diminishing  because  those  institutions  are  dependent  upon
financial support from the Sikh community in Afghanistan which is  itself  a
diminishing  resource  given  that  there  are  so  few  of  that  community
remaining in Afghanistan. Against that background I have concluded that  the
tribunal's decision is not in error on that point which, in any  event,  was
not made in the grounds of appeal, nor in the grant  of  permission  nor  in
any oral submissions to me.

16.   Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is
dismissed.

Decision

The decision of the tribunal did not involve the making  of  an  error  law.
Accordingly, that decision shall stand.  The  Secretary  of  State's  appeal
is, therefore, dismissed.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal granted the claimant anonymity. I  have  decided  to
continue  that  grant  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  name  or
otherwise identify the claimant or any member  of  his  family.  Failure  to
comply may lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.
