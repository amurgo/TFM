Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    In person.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the re-making of the decision  on  the  appeal  of  Mr  Kothari
    (hereafter the "claimant"), a national of  India  born  on  29  October
    1986, against the Secretary of State's decision of 6 December  2017  to
    refuse to issue him with a residence card[1] as the former spouse of Ms
    [EC] (hereafter the "sponsor"), a Polish national exercising EEA Treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom.

 2. By a decision promulgated on 29 January 2019 (the  "EOL  decision"),  I
    set aside the decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Sweet  who
    allowed the appeal of the claimant. My reasons for  setting  aside  the
    judge's decision are set out in the EOL decision which  is  annexed  to
    this decision as Annex A

 3. In order to succeed in the re-making of the decision on his appeal, the
    claimant needs to establish:

      (i)   the date on which his divorce proceedings were initiated; and

      (ii)  that the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights as at that date.

 4. In the EOL decision, I issued directions to the Secretary of  State  to
    make such enquiries as he could reasonably make in order  to  establish
    whether the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights for what was stated in
    the EOL decision to be the Relevant Period.

 5. The case was subsequently listed for case management review on 9  April
    2019. It was then listed for full hearing on 30 July 2019.

 6. By 30 July 2019, the claimant had produced evidence  that  his  divorce
    proceedings  commenced  on  24  February  2016.  He  also  submitted  a
    substantial number of  documents  on  the  basis  of  which  Mr  Clarke
    accepted, albeit that this issue was not relevant because this was  not
    an appeal against a refusal of a permanent  residence  card,  that  the
    claimant has been working from and after 24 February 2019 such that, if
    he were an EEA national, he would  be  regarded  as  exercising  Treaty
    rights continuously from 24 February 2016 to the date of the hearing on
    30 July 2019.

 7. However, the difficulty for the claimant concerns the lack of  evidence
    that the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights as at 24  February  2016.
    As stated at para 3 of the Directions dated 9 April 2019, the  evidence
    that the Secretary of State has obtained from  HMRC  and  filed  is  as
    follows:

            Tax year   Results of enquiries with HMRC

       a)     2012-2013   The  sponsor  did  not  declare  any  earnings  or
    benefits.

      b)    2013-2015  The  sponsor  received  job-seeker's  allowance,  the
                       exact dates of which are not shown in HMRC's system.

       c)     2015-2016   The  sponsor  did  not  declare  any  earnings  or
                            benefits.

       d)     2016-2017   (i)  There  was  one  employment  with  SM  Global
                       Consultancy for which the sponsor  declared  earnings
                       of �1,261.80; and
                 (ii) There was one employment with Trueland  Limited,  from
                       March to April 2017, for which  the  sponsor  claimed
                       �55.80; and
                 (iii) the sponsor declared receiving jobseekers'  allowance
                       between 9 May 2016 and 7 August 2016.

       e)     2017-2018   The  sponsor  did  not  declare  any  earnings  or
                       benefits.

 8. As can be seen from c) above, the sponsor did not declare any  earnings
    or benefits in the tax year 2015-2016. This is the tax year that  spans
    24 February 2016. Accordingly, the  Secretary  of  State's  efforts  in
    making reasonable enquiries have not produced  relevant  evidence  that
    assists the claimant.

 9. At the hearing on 30 July 2019, the claimant said that he has done  his
    best to obtain evidence but has not been able to do so. He was  anxious
    to explain to me that he has opportunities for other work available  to
    him and that his life has been on hold.

10. The judge found, on the basis of unsupported evidence before her,  that
    the claimant's divorce proceedings were initiated in 2017. This has now
    been  proved  to  be  incorrect  because  the  claimant  has  submitted
    documentary evidence from the Family Court which shows that his divorce
    proceedings were initiated on 24 February 2016. At para 19  ii)  a)  of
    the EOL decision, I referred to the evidence that the claimant gave the
    judge, i.e. that he had been told by  the  sponsor's  mother  that  the
    sponsor had been working continuously  from  22  September  2012  until
    December 2016. This hearsay evidence, when combined with  the  evidence
    from HMRC for the tax year from 2015-2016, is  simply  insufficient  to
    discharge the burden of proof that is on the claimant to  the  standard
    of the balance of probabilities to show that the sponsor was exercising
    Treaty rights as at 24 February 2016.

11. The claimant therefore does not satisfy the requirements for the  grant
    of a residence card.

12. Accordingly, whilst I have every sympathy for the claimant, I am  bound
    to dismiss his appeal.

      Decision

    The decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Sweet  involved  the
    making of errors of law sufficient to require it to be set aside.

      Accordingly, her decision was set aside.

      The Upper Tribunal re-makes the  decision  on  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision by dismissing his appeal.

Representation:
For the appellant:     (In person)
For the respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                           Decision and Directions


 1. The Secretary of State has been granted permission to appeal against  a
    decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Sweet who, in  a  decision
    promulgated on 24 September 2018 following a hearing  on  11  September
    2018, allowed the appeal of Mr Masum Rajeshkumar Kothari, a national of
    India born on 29 October 1986  (hereafter  the  "claimant")  against  a
    decision of the respondent of 6 December 2017 to refuse  to  issue  him
    with a residence card as confirmation that he had a retained  right  of
    residence in the United Kingdom as the former  spouse  of  Ms  [EC],  a
    Polish national exercising EEA Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

 2. The claimant, who appeared unrepresented at the hearing before me,  did
    not request an adjournment. I  could  see  no  reason  to  adjourn  the
    hearing. I explained that I would consider whether the judge's decision
    should be set aside and, in simple terms, the basic principles I  would
    need to apply.

 3. The refusal decision was made under the Immigration (European  Economic
    Area)  Regulations  2016  (hereafter  the  "2016   Regulations").   The
    respondent refused the claimant's application of 18 September 2017  for
    a residence card for the following reasons:

    i)     He had failed to provide a  divorce  certificate  and  therefore
         there was no evidence that the marriage had been terminated so that
         the claimant could benefit from regulation 10(5).

    ii)    He had failed to provide a valid identity card or passport in Ms
         [C]'s name, as required by regulation 21(5).

 4.  The  respondent  therefore  did  not  consider  whether  the  claimant
    satisfied the remaining requirements for a retained right of residence.

 5. The sole issue before me is whether the judge materially erred  in  law
    in reaching his conclusion that the claimant had  established,  to  the
    standard of the balance of probabilities, that  Ms  [C]  had  exercised
    Treaty rights for the relevant period in order  to  derive  a  retained
    right of residence.

 6. The claimant entered into his marriage with Ms [C] on  13  April  2012.
    The evidence before the judge was that the decree absolute,  dissolving
    the marriage, was issued on 9 January  2018.  The  divorce  proceedings
    were commenced  some  time  between  January  2017  (according  to  the
    claimant's evidence, para 20 of the  judge's  decision)  and  September
    2017, as shown on a court document dated 22 September 2017 (para 20  of
    the judge's decision).

 7. Accordingly, Mr Clarke submitted  that,  on  the  evidence  before  the
    judge, the period for which the claimant needed to  establish  that  Ms
    [C] had been exercising Treaty rights in the  United  Kingdom  was  the
    period from 22 September 2012  to  22  September  2017  (hereafter  the
    "Relevant Period"). I agree with Mr Clarke's analysis of the start  and
    end dates of this period.

Regulations 6 and 10 of the 2016 Regulations

 8. In Gauswami (retained right of residence: jobseekers) India [2018] UKUT
    00275 (IAC), a decision by  the  President  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Rimington, the Tribunal held that,  for  the  purposes  of  determining
    retained rights of  residence,  in  regulation  10(6)(a)  of  the  2016
    Regulations (as well as its predecessor), the  reference  to  a  worker
    includes a jobseeker.

 9. In the instant appeal, it is relevant to set out regulation  6  insofar
    as it sets out the requirements for  a  person  to  be  regarded  as  a
    jobseeker as well as regulation 10(5) which sets out  the  requirements
    to be met for a person to have a retained  right  of  residence.  These
    provide (insofar as relevant) as follows:


         6. "Qualified person"
             (1) In these Regulations, "qualified person"  means  a  person
                  who is an EEA national and in the United Kingdom as-
                  (a)  a jobseeker;
                  (b)  a worker;
                  (c)  a self-employed person;
                  (d)  a self-sufficient person; or
                  (e)  a student.
             (2) Subject to regulations 7A(4) and 7B(4), a person who is no
                  longer working shall not cease to be treated as  a  worker
                  for the purpose of paragraph (1)(b) if-
                  (a)  he is temporarily unable to work as the result of  an
                      illness or accident;
                  (b)  he is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after
                      having been employed in the  United  Kingdom  for  at
                      least one year, provided that he -
                      (i)   has registered as a jobseeker with the relevant
                           employment office; and
                      (ii)  satisfies conditions A and B;
                  (ba) he is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after
                      having been employed in the United Kingdom  for  less
                      than one year, provided that he -
                      (i)   has registered as a jobseeker with the relevant
                           employment office; and
                      (ii)  satisfied conditions A and B.
                  (c)  he is involuntarily unemployed and  has  embarked  on
                      vocational training; or
                  (d)  he has voluntarily ceased  working  and  embarked  on
                      vocational training that is related to  his  previous
                      employment.
             (2A)      A person to whom paragraph (2)(ba) applies may  only
                  retain worker status for a maximum of six months.
              (3)      ...
             (4) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), "jobseeker"  means  a
                  person who satisfies conditions A, B and, where  relevant,
                  C.
             (5) Condition A is that the person -
                  (a)   entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  order   to   seek
                      employment; or
                  (b)  is present in the United Kingdom seeking  employment,
                      immediately after enjoying a right to reside pursuant
                      to paragraph (1)(b) to (e) (disregarding  any  period
                      during which worker status was retained  pursuant  to
                      paragraph (2)(b) or (ba).
             (6) Condition B is that the person can provide  evidence  that
                  he is seeking employment and has a genuine chance of being
                  engaged.
             (7) A person may not retain the status of a worker pursuant to
                  paragraph  (2)(b),  or  jobseeker  pursuant  to  paragraph
                  (1)(a), for longer than the relevant period unless she can
                  provide compelling evidence that he is continuing to  seek
                  employment and has a genuine chance of being engaged.
             (8) In paragraph (7), "the relevant period" means -
                  (a)  in the case  of  a  person  retaining  worker  status
                      pursuant to paragraph (2)(b), a continuous period  of
                      six months;
                  (b)  in the case  of  a  jobseeker,  91  days,  minus  the
                      cumulative total of any days during which the  person
                      concerned previously enjoyed a right to reside  as  a
                      jobseeker,  not  including  any  days  prior   to   a
                      continuous absence from  the  United  Kingdom  of  at
                      least 12 months.
             (9)  Condition  C  applies  where  the  person  concerned  has
                  previously,  enjoyed  a  right  to   reside   under   this
                  regulation as a result of satisfying conditions A and B -
                  (a)  in the case of a person to whom paragraph  (2)(b)  or
                      (ba) applied, for at least six months; or
                  (b)  in the case of a jobseeker, for at least 91  days  in
                      total,
                  unless the person concerned has, since enjoying the  above
                  right to reside, been continuously absent from the  United
                  Kingdom for at least 12 months.
             (10)      Condition C is that the person has had a  period  of
                  absence from the United Kingdom.
             (11)      Where condition C applies -
                  (a)  paragraph (7) does not apply; and
                  (b)  condition  B  has  effect  as  if  "compelling"  were
                      inserted before "evidence".

            "Family member who has retained the right of residence"


      10.-(1)    In these Regulations, "family member who has  retained  the
                  right of residence" means, subject to paragraphs  (8)  and
                  (9), a person who satisfies a condition in paragraph  (2),
                  (3), (4) or (5).
            (2)  ...
            (3)  ...
            (4)  ...
            (5)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person ("A")-
                 (a)   ceased to be a family member of  a  qualified  person
                       or  an  EEA  national  with  a  right  of   permanent
                       residence on the termination of the marriage or civil
                       partnership of A;
                 (b)   was residing in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance
                       with  these  Regulations   at   the   date   of   the
                       termination;
                 (c)   satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and
                 (d)   either-
                       (i)   prior to the initiation of the proceedings  for

                            partnership, the marriage or civil  partnership
                            had lasted for at least  three  years  and  the

                            had resided in the United Kingdom for at  least

                 (b)   is the family member of a  person  who  falls  within

The judge's decision

10. The judge heard oral evidence from the claimant. At paras 11-15 of  his
    decision, the judge summarised the oral evidence. Paras 12-14 relate to
    the evidence that the claimant gave concerning  Ms  [C]'s  exercise  of
    Treaty rights. Para 10 is also relevant. These paragraphs read:

        "10.     ... The question was whether the  sponsor  was  exercising
             Treaty Rights at the  start  of  the  divorce  proceedings  in
             January 2017. She was looking for work in that month....


        12.      His ex-wife left their home at the end of  2015.  She  was
             working as a cleaner with her mother. They  got  work  through
             contacts and the mother was already working for other  people.
             There was no other paid work.


        13.      In respect of his second statement, he stated that his ex-
             spouse was working as a cleaner until December 2016  -  as  he
             was told by friends and her mother. She did not take on  other
             paid work. She had worked with her mother since 2012  and  had
             carried out no other paid work. He dealt with her finances  He
             does not know if she declared  her  income  to  HMRC.  He  was
             trying to get her back. She  ignored  him.  He  has  no  other
             details regarding her looking for work.


        14.      He showed a screenshot on Facebook which showed  that  she
             started working at Hanwell care home on 15 July  2018.  He  is
             not friends with her on Facebook. Her profile  is  public  and
             not  private  as  he  can  see  her  pictures.   He   has   no
             correspondence showing their joint address."


11. The judge's consideration of this evidence is at  paras  22-23  of  his
    decision which read:

        "22.     ... He has had  difficulties  in  obtaining  the  relevant
             documents from his  ex-spouse  because  of  the  breakdown  in
             relations from 2015  onwards.  However,  there  is  now  clear
             evidence that his ex-spouse had been exercising Treaty  Rights
             at the time, being employed as a cleaner in  a  business  with
             her mother from 2012 up to December 2016. It appears that  she
             was then job seeking and from 15  July  2018  was  working  at
             Hanwell Care Home, though it is not known when  she  commenced
             that employment.


        23.       Based  on  my  assessment  of  the  credibility  of   the
             appellant's evidence, I am satisfied that  his  ex-spouse  was
             indeed exercising Treaty Rights, whether  as  an  employee  or
             self-employed person or as a job-seeker, over the relevant  5-
             year period from 2012. They had been  married  for  more  than
             three years and had lived together for more than one year.  He
             has provided evidence of the start of divorce  proceedings  in
             2017 (and the decree absolute of January  2018)  and  his  ex-
             spouse's ID card."


12. The judge's findings may be summarised as follows:

      i)    The claimant had produced evidence of the start of  the  divorce
        proceedings in 2017 and the decree absolute dissolving the marriage
        on 9 January 2018 (para 23 of the judge's decision).

      ii)   The claimant had produced Ms [C]'s identity  card  (para  23  of
        the judge's decision).

      iii)  The claimant and Ms [C] had been married  for  more  than  three
        years and had lived together for more than one year.

      iv)   Based on his assessment of the  credibility  of  the  claimant's
        evidence,  the  judge  was  satisfied  that  Ms  [C]  "was   indeed
        exercising Treaty rights, whether as an employee  or  self-employed
        persons or as a job-seeker, over the [Relevant Period].

The grounds

13. The judge's findings as set out at para 12 i), ii) and iii) above  were
    not challenged in the Secretary of State's grounds.

14. The grounds  only  challenge  the  judge's  finding  that  Ms  [C]  had
    exercised Treaty rights for the duration of the Relevant  Period.   The
    grounds contend that the judge erred in reaching this  finding  because
    he relied solely upon  the  claimant's  oral  evidence.  There  was  no
    documentary evidence at all to show at  Ms  [C]  had  exercised  Treaty
    rights at any point of the  marriage.  The  judge  therefore  erred  in
    stating, at para  22  of  his  decision,  that  there  was  now  "clear
    evidence" that Ms [C] had been exercising Treaty rights at the relevant
    time.

Submissions

15. Mr Clarke referred me  to  the  evidence  that  was  before  the  judge
    concerning the exercise by Ms  [C]  of  Treaty  rights,  which  was  as
    follows:

    i)     In relation to the period from 2012 to 2016, it was  clear  from
         para 13 of the judge's decision that the evidence was oral evidence
         from the claimant that he had been told by  friends  and  Ms  [C]'s
         mother that Ms [C] was working as a cleaner until December 2016. Mr
         Clarke asked me to note the  judge's  reliance  not  only  on  oral
         evidence but hearsay evidence.

    ii)    In relation to 2017, the only evidence  was  that  mentioned  in
         para 10, that Ms [C] was looking for work  in  January  2017.  This
         evidence was based on the claimant's handwritten witness statement.
         Mr Clarke asked me to note that the judge again relied only on  the
         appellant's own  evidence.  There  was  no  supporting  documentary
         evidence.  In  addition,  there  was  no  evidence  that  she   was
         registered as a jobseeker or that she had a genuine chance of being
         employed. Furthermore, the claimant's evidence only  concerned  the
         month of January 2017.

    iii)   In relation to the period from the date that  the  marriage  was
         terminated (9  January  2018)  to  the  date  of  the  hearing  (11
         September 2018), the only evidence was the screenshot from Ms [C]'s
         Facebook page which showed that she started working at Hanwell Care
         Home on 15 July 2018.

16. Mr Clarke submitted that, given the evidence that was before  him,  the
    judge was simply not entitled to conclude that the evidence before  him
    enabled the claimant to discharge the burden of proof on  the  standard
    of the balance of probabilities that Ms [C] had been exercising  Treaty
    rights for the duration of the Relevant Period. He was not entitled  to
    find that there was  "clear  evidence"  of  Ms  [C]  exercising  Treaty
    rights.

17. The claimant said that he had tried hard  to  resume  his  relationship
    with Ms [C] to no avail. He  then  asked  her  to  help  him  with  the
    documents he needed to establish his case  but  she  rejected  him.  He
    therefore looked at her  Facebook  page  and  saw  photographs  of  her
    working at Hanwell Care Home which he  showed  to  the  judge  and  the
    Presenting Officer at the hearing before the judge.

18. I reserved my decision.

Assessment

19. I am satisfied that the judge erred in law in reaching his finding that
    the claimant had established that Ms [C] was exercising  Treaty  rights
    for the duration of the Relevant Period, for the following reasons:

    i)     In the first place, it is plain that the judge relied  upon  the
         claimant's own subjective evidence, hearsay evidence (i.e. what the
         claimant was told by Ms [C]'s mother)  and  a  screenshot  from  Ms
         [C]'s Facebook page.  Such evidence, even  taken  cumulatively,  is
         simply  incapable  of  discharging  the  burden  of  proof  to  the
         applicable  standard  of  the  balance  of  probabilities,  on  any
         legitimate view. In concluding that it was sufficient, the judge in
         effect applied too low a standard of proof.

    ii)    Further, and in any event, it is plain that there were  material
         periods within the Relevant Period in respect of  which  there  was
         simply no evidence  whatsoever,  not  even  any  oral  evidence  or
         hearsay  evidence  or  evidence  from  Ms  [C]'s   Facebook   page.
         Specifically:

      a)   In relation to the period from 2012 to 2016, there is nothing to
             show that the claimant was told by Ms [C]'s mother that Ms [C]
             had been working continuously from  22  September  2012  until
             December 2016. She merely told the claimant that  Ms  [C]  was
             working as a cleaner "until December 2016", not that  she  was
             working continuously from September 2012 to December 2016.

      b)   In relation to the year 2017, the only evidence that  the  judge
             had was the evidence in the claimant's written statement, that
             Ms [C]  was  looking  for  work  in  January  2017.  This  was
             insufficient to show that she was  a  "jobseeker"  within  the
             meaning of regulation 6. There was no evidence  to  show  that
             regulation 6(2), which included a requirement that Ms  [C]  be
             registered as a jobseeker with the relevant employment office,
             was satisfied. Furthermore,  there  was  no  evidence  at  all
             whether Ms [C]  was  looking  for  work  or  working  for  the
             remainder of the year 2017.

      c)   In relation to the period from the date of  divorce  (9  January
             2018) until the date of  the  hearing  before  the  judge  (11
             September 2018), the only evidence was the screenshot from  Ms
             [C]'s  Facebook  page  which,  even  if  such   evidence   was
             sufficient to discharge the burden of proof on the balance  of
             probabilities (which is not the case), only  related  to  July
             2018. There was simply no evidence that she was  working  from
             January 2018 until June 2018 or from August 2018 to  September
             2018.

20. Accordingly, not only is it the case that  the  judge's  finding,  that
    there was "clear evidence", was based on the claimant's own  subjective
    written and oral evidence, hearsay evidence and evidence from Ms  [C]'s
    Facebook page which,  even  taken  cumulatively,  was  insufficient  to
    discharge the burden of  proof  on  the  standard  of  the  balance  of
    probabilities, it  was  speculative,  in  that,  there  was  simply  no
    evidence at all in respect of certain parts of the Relevant Period,  as
    explained above.

21. I am therefore satisfied that the judge erred in law  in  reaching  his
    finding that the claimant had established that Ms  [C]  was  exercising
    Treaty rights for the duration of the Relevant Period. As he could  not
    otherwise have allowed this appeal, his error was material.

22. I therefore set aside the judge's  decision  to  allow  the  claimant's
    appeal.

23. In re-making the decision, Mr Clarke accepted that the judge had  found
    the  claimant  credible  and  that  the  Secretary  of  State  has  not
    challenged the judge's findings that: (i) the claimant had produced  Ms
    [C]'s identity card (para 23 of the  judge's  decision);  (ii)  he  had
    produced evidence of the start of the divorce proceedings in  2017  and
    the decree absolute dissolving the marriage on 9 January 2018 (para  23
    of the judge's decision);  and (iii) the claimant and Ms [C]  had  been
    married for more than three years and had lived together for more  than
    one year.

24. On this basis, Mr Clarke  accepted  that  the  claimant  satisfied  the
    requirements of regulation 10(5)(d)(i) and that he only  now  needs  to
    establish:

    i)     that Ms [C]  was  exercising  Treaty  rights  for  the  Relevant
         Period; and

    ii)    if he were an EEA national, he would be regarded  as  exercising
         Treaty rights from 9 January 2018, the date that the  marriage  was
         terminated.

25. In relation to the requirement that Ms [C] was exercising Treaty rights
    for the Relevant Period, Mr Clarke accepted that, given that the  judge
    found the claimant credible and that the claimant gave evidence that he
    had asked Ms [C], unsuccessfully, to help him by providing documents to
    support his application, it would be difficult for him to argue against
    the Upper Tribunal  directing  the  Secretary  of  State  to  undertake
    enquiries in order to establish whether Ms  [C]  had  exercised  Treaty
    rights for the Relevant Period,  in accordance with  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy[2].

26. I am therefore issuing such a direction to the Secretary of State.

27. The claimant also needs to show that he satisfies regulation  10(6)(a).
    In this regard, I explained very  carefully  to  the  claimant  at  the
    hearing that, if the judge's decision were to be set  aside,  he  would
    need to submit documents to show that he had been  working  or,  if  he
    were an EEA national, would be regarded as exercising Treaty rights for
    any relevant period. I told him to submit documents showing that he has
    been working from September 2017 until the date of the  hearing  before
    me together with a letter from Tesco Stores plc to confirm (as  he  had
    said at the hearing before me) that payslips are only available  online
    from November 2018. I made it clear to him  that  it  was  for  him  to
    ensure that he sent me documents to cover the entire period and that  I
    would not be requesting documents for any missing period.

28. Notwithstanding my clear instructions that the Upper  Tribunal  has  no
    responsibility for requesting any missing documents and that it was his
    responsibility to ensure that he submitted all necessary  documents,  I
    received a bundle of documents from the claimant by email on 22 January
    2019 with payslips and other documents which do not  cover  the  entire
    period from September 2017 until 16  January  2019,  the  date  of  the
    hearing before me. In his cover email, he said that  he  has  requested
    copies of his October - December 2017 payslips "which I can forward  to
    you in 5 days should it be needed".

29. In addition, it appears that the claimant did not send to the Secretary
    of State a copy of the documents he sent to the Upper  Tribunal  on  22
    January 2019.

30. The claimant is reminded, as he was told at the hearing, that it is his
    responsibility to decide what evidence he needs to submit in  order  to
    establish that, if he were an EEA national, he  would  be  regarded  as
    exercising Treaty rights in the United  Kingdom.  Put  simply,  if  the
    Upper Tribunal is not in possession of  necessary  documents,  he  will
    lose his appeal. The Upper Tribunal will not request missing documents.



31. This appeal will be listed for a  case  management  review  hearing  in
    three months and a resumed hearing on the first available date after  4
    months.  It is part-heard.  Both  hearings  will  therefore  be  listed
    before me.

DECISION

The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Sweet involved  the  making
of errors on points of law such that the decision to  allow  the  appeal  is
set aside.

The Upper Tribunal will re-make the decision on the claimant's appeal  at  a
resumed hearing.

DIRECTIONS:

1.    I direct the Secretary of State to undertake such enquiries as he  can
    reasonably  undertake  in  order  to  establish  whether  Ms  [C]   was
    exercising Treaty rights for the duration of the Relevant Period,  i.e.
    for the period from 22 September 2012 to 22 September 2017.

2.    I direct the claimant to serve on the Secretary of State, within  five
    calendar days of the date that this decision is sent to the parties,  a
    copy of his email dated 22 January 2019 to the Upper Tribunal timed  at
    01:04 and the attachments to that email.

3.    It is for the claimant to decide what evidence is  necessary  for  him
    to establish that he satisfies regulation 10(6)(a).  If  he  wishes  to
    rely upon any further evidence in this regard, he must serve  any  such
    evidence on the Upper Tribunal and the Secretary of  State  within  ten
    calendar days of the date that this decision is sent to the parties.

4.    The respondent to inform the Upper Tribunal  at  the  case  management
    review hearing:

      (i)   the outcome of his  enquiries  concerning  whether  Ms  [C]  was
         exercising Treaty rights for the duration of the  Relevant  Period;
         and

      (ii)  whether the respondent accepts that the claimant  satisfies  the
         requirements of regulation 10(6)(a).

Both  parties  are  to  attend  the  case  management  review  hearing.   No
         exceptions.
