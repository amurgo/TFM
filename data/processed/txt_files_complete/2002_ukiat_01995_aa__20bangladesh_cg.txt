                            ABDUL  KARIM  ANSARI

                                                                   APPELLANT

                                     and


                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                                                  RESPONDENT

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh, was given leave to  appeal  to
      the Tribunal against the determination of an Adjudicator, Mrs N. Bird,
      who dismissed his appeal against the  refusal  of  the  respondent  to
      grant asylum.

2.    The appellant was represented by Mrs M.A.  Hodgson,  of  counsel,  and
      the Secretary of State by Mr  D.  Ekagha,  a  Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer.

3.    The Vice President who gave leave to appeal did so on the  basis  that
      he  considered  that   the   grounds   of   appeal   merited   further
      consideration.  In particular, he considered that the adjudicator made
      no clear findings of fact nor  has  she  considered  the  question  of
      protection by the state against the activities of  the  Osmani  group.
      We do not propose to enter into any lengthy observations in this case,
      save to say that  in  our  view  the  Adjudicator's  determination  is
      flawed.  We fully agree with the Vice President's view and suffice  it
      to say that both Mrs Hodgson and Mr Ekagha wish for the matter  to  be
      remitted for rehearing before an Adjudicator other than Mrs Bird.

4.    We therefore in accordance with that request, and in  accordance  with
      our own view herein, remit this case for hearing before an adjudicator
       other than Mrs Bird.




                             HIS HONOUR D HOLDEN
                                  CHAIRMAN
