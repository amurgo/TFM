                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Pooler promulgated on 12th March 2014 following a hearing  at
        Stoke-on-Trent on  3rd  March  2014,  in  which  he  dismissed  the
        Appellant's appeal on  both  Immigration  Rules  and  human  rights
        grounds.


     2. The Appellant, a national of Pakistan born  on  1st  January  1991,
        applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom as  a  partner  under
        Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. The application  was  refused
        by an Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) on 20th November 2012 as it was
        found the Appellant had not submitted all the required documents to
        demonstrate that the  sponsor's  income  was  as  claimed  and,  in
        particular, that no signed contract of employment  or  letter  from
        the sponsor's employer had  been  submitted.  The  application  was
        refused by reference to paragraph EC-P.1.1 (d) of Appendix FM.


     3. The Judge set out the correct self-direction  in  relation  to  the
        burden and standard of proof [6] and examined the first  ground  of
        challenge before him which related to the claim that  the  decision
        was not in accordance with the Immigration Rules. In  paragraphs  9
        and 10 of his determination the Judge finds:


     9.   Mr Khan relied on the letter of 10 December 2012, submitting  that
   it         met the requirements of paragraph 2 (b) of Appendix FM.  I  am
          however not satisfied that those requirements  were  met  by  this
   letter.        The letter did not state the period over which the sponsor
   had been        paid  the  level  of  salary  relied  upon  in  the  visa
   application. Basic      salary was said in the letter  to  be  ï¿½18,342.24
   per annum and Mr Khan        submitted that this was sufficient.  It  is,
   in my judgement, not             sufficient. In addition, the letter  did
   not state whether the sponsor's        employment  was  permanent,  fixed
   term contract or agency as            required by the Rules.


     10.  Mr Khan relied on the letter of 8  July  2009  as  fulfilling  the
          requirement to provide a signed  contract  of  employment.  In  my
   judgment, the letter does not meet that requirement  because  it  did  no
   more than confirm  changes  in  the  sponsor's  job  title,  location  of
   work, salary and provision  for  discretionary  commission.  It  did  not
   set out the terms of  the  sponsor's  employment  and  in  any  event  it
   was not signed.


     4. The second ground asserted that discretion under the  Rules  should
        have been exercised differently but this was dismissed on the basis
        Mr Khan had failed to identify any paragraph  in  the  Rules  under
        which any such discretion arose.


     5. In relation to  the  human  rights  appeal  Judge  Pooler  reminded
        himself of relevant case law of the Upper Tribunal  and  noted  the
        Appellant placed no reliance upon the High Court decision in MM  as
        he claimed he could meet the requirements of the Rules. In light of
        the earlier finding that the requirements of the Rules could not be
        satisfied the Judge considered whether there were any unjustifiably
        harsh  consequences  arising  from  the   decision   that   merited
        consideration outside  the  Rules,  did  not  find  that  any  such
        circumstances had been proved to exist, and dismissed this  element
        of the appeal  too.   In  the  alternative,  the  Judge  stated  in
        paragraph 18 that had he approached the Article  8  appeal  in  the
        manner  recommended  in  Razgar  the  decision  would   have   been
        proportionate in any event.


     6. The determination is challenged  on  grounds  asserting  the  Judge
        failed to properly consider the evidence filed in relation  to  the
        application  and  failed  to  exercise  discretion  or   evidential
        flexibility in relation to  the  documents  provided.  The  grounds
        assert the Judge failed to give consideration  to  the  High  Court
        judgment in MM and Ors [2013] EWHC 1900 which  is  stated  to  have
        been mentioned in the skeleton argument and that  a  finding  there
        was nothing exceptional  about  the  Appellant's  circumstances  is
        wholly unfounded.



Error of law


     7. All previous challenges to the lawfulness of the Immigration  Rules
        have failed before the High Court and above. Those  Rules  set  out
        the criteria that have to be met before an individual  is  entitled
        to a grant of leave to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom.  In
        respect of spousal applications they include provisions relating to
        status,  language  ability,   and   set   out   minimal   financial
        requirements. The Rules also set out in clear and unambiguous terms
        the specific documentary evidence that has to be provided to enable
        an individual to show that they are able to  satisfy  the  relevant
        requirements.


     8. In this case various assertions have been made in  support  of  the
        application which were not considered to have been  proved  by  the
        provision of mandatory documents. The Judge clearly considered  the
        evidence he was asked to consider with the  appropriate  degree  of
        anxious scrutiny and has  given  clear  reasons  for  why,  in  his
        judgment, the Appellant is unable to meet the requirements  of  the
        Rules.   Such  a  finding  has  not  been  shown  to  be  perverse,
        irrational, or contrary  to  the  evidence.  Whilst  evidence  from
        various other sources may provide an indication  of  the  sponsor's
        financial  situation,  unless  that  information  is  provided   in
        accordance with the  mandatory  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  the
        application must fail. The material relied upon  by  the  Appellant
        has not been shown to have met such requirements and  therefore  no
        legal error is proved.


     9. In relation to the assertion discretion should have been  exercised
        or that there should have been some flexibility,  the  reason  this
        application was refused is because the mandatory evidence  had  not
        been provided and was  absent.  If  mandatory  information  is  not
        present it is hard to see how any discretion is  relevant.  It  has
        not been established that there was any requirement upon the  Entry
        Clearance Officer to contact the Appellant on  the  facts  of  this
        case. Appendix FM (d) (e)  provides  details  of  circumstances  in
        which there may be a need to contact an applicant but  it  has  not
        been established that  the  decision  maker  was  unaware  of  such
        provisions or deliberately ignored them. On the facts of this  case
        it has not been proved any arguable error exists such as to  affect
        the validity of the decision in not exercising discretion and there
        is no legal error in the Judge  considering  the  evidence  in  the
        holistic approach taken.


    10. There is  no  arguable  merit  in  the  challenge  to  the  Judge's
        conclusions regarding Article 8. The High Court decision in MM  has
        now been overturned by the Court of Appeal and the conclusion  that
        no unjustifiably harsh consequences will arise has not be shown  to
        be tainted by any arguable legal error on the basis of the evidence
        the  Judge  was  asked  to  consider.  No  fairness/Rodriguez/Patel
        arguments are established either.


    11. In simple terms, the Appellant failed to properly note  the  formal
        requirements for applications in Appendix FM-SE and  so  failed  to
        ensure that the required information was  provided.   The  decision
        maker was entitled to arrive at the conclusions he or  she  did  on
        the basis of the evidence advanced in support of the claim and  the
        Judge was in fully entitled to arrive at the conclusions he did  on
        the facts of this case.


    12. If the Appellant wishes to enter the United Kingdom it is  open  to
        him to make a fresh application in support of which he  can  ensure
        that the mandatory requirements of the Rules are addressed.


Decision

    13. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    14. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
