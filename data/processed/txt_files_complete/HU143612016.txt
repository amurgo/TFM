Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Plowright, instructed by Perera & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the Secretary of State's appeal against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  appeal  of  Mr  Odunsi  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer refusing  his  application  for
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM of
    HC 395.

2.   The appellant, as I will refer to Mr Odunsi as he was before the  judge
    though of course he is  technically  now  the  respondent  and  I  will
    hereafter refer to the Entry Clearance Officer as the respondent has  a
    somewhat complicated immigration history and I will take that from  the
    Counsel's chronology set out in the Rule  24  response.   He  initially
    came to the United Kingdom as a visitor in  2005  and  overstayed.   In
    2006 he attempted to open a bank account  with  a  counterfeit  British
    passport, was removed from the United Kingdom on 1  August  2006,  then
    returned as a  visitor  having  been  granted  entry  clearance  on  29
    November 2006 to 29 November 2008.  When he attempted to  re-enter  the
    United Kingdom in 2008 he was told there was an outstanding prosecution
    and when he attempted  to  open  a  bank  account  in  2006  using  the
    counterfeit British passport he was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced
    to six months' imprisonment and subsequently removed.  He  married  the
    sponsor, Mrs Showunmi, in September 2015 and made the  application  for
    entry clearance a  couple  of  months  later.   He  was  refused  under
    paragraph 320(11) of the Immigration Rules in relation to  the  offence
    that he had committed and also on the basis that the  sponsor  was  not
    present and settled  in  the  United  Kingdom  or  being  admitted  for
    settlement on the basis that  the  relationship  was  not  genuine  and
    subsisting and that he had not provided a recent letter  of  employment
    or his sponsor's P60.  So those were the matters that the judge had  to
    consider and the judge concluded that the claim succeeded on the  basis
    that the relationship was a genuine one.  He  noted  that  the  refusal
    under paragraph 320(11) is discretionary and said this:

         "I also note that the aggravating features in this  case  that  the
         appellant attempted to open a bank account  using  a  fake  British
         passport in 2006 is not in my view sufficiently aggravating such as
         to justify refusal taking into account all the circumstances.  This
         was not a case of violence, it was not a recent offence, it was  an
         offence that took place some 10 years ago  and  the  appellant  had
         been punished by a short term of imprisonment and therefore  in  my
         view although  there  is  no  excuse  for  the  appellant  to  have
         committed that offence and he admits this in his witness statement,
         nevertheless is not sufficiently aggravating in  the  circumstances
         of this case generally to justify refusal."


3.   As regards the sponsor's earnings he concluded as well as  there  being
    sufficient to show this was a genuine marriage and one  subsisting  and
    entered into on the basis of love and affection, he noted a letter from
    the sponsor's employer in which it had been said that she  was  working
    at the relevant time for Yarrow Housing Limited.  There are  references
    to that in the bundle and moving on  to  work  for  Croydon  Children's
    Services and he took into account documentation in  relation  to  that.
    He says that the appellant's, it must be of course the  sponsor's  P60s
    for 2016, 2015, 2013 and 2012 were contained  in  the  respondent's,  a
    mistake there because as she made clear in her oral  evidence  she  had
    not provided the P60 for April 2015 and she  had  not  thought  it  was
    necessary to include that and he allowed the appeal under Article 8  on
    the basis that the appellant met the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  That was a weighty factor to take into account when considering
    proportionality  with  regard  to  the  discretionary   refusal   under
    paragraph 320(11).

4.   There are three grounds of challenge to this decision and I should  say
    I  found  very  helpful  and  objective   the   submissions   by   both
    representatives in this case and I am grateful to them both.  The first
    point is that permission was  granted  on  all  grounds  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Holmes.  The first ground of challenge was  with  regard
    to Appendix FM-SE and it was said that no reasons had  been  given  for
    why the requirements of that section of the Rules had been met.   There
    is secondly a challenge to the findings about  the  relationship  being
    genuine and subsisting  and  thirdly,  in  relation  to  the  paragraph
    322(11) the findings of the judge and the date of the offence.  It  was
    said that the offence was in 2008 and therefore not over ten years ago.

5.   Turning to the first of these it is necessary to look  at  the  reasons
    for refusal which were  in  fact  quite  brief  in  this  regard.   The
    decision maker  said,  "you  have  not  provided  a  recent  letter  of
    employment or your sponsor's P60, you have therefore not  provided  all
    the required specified evidence".  Looking at  the  matter  first,  the
    P60, it is clear from the wording of the Rule that a P60  may  also  be
    submitted in respect of paid employment in the United  Kingdom  and  is
    not required to be and therefore the absence of the P60 could not in my
    judgment be said to be fatal and the judge's  mistake  in  relation  to
    that is therefore also not fatal.  It is clear that the employment with
    Yarrow Housing Limited rather than  Croydon  Council  is  the  relevant
    employment to be taken into account and in this regard we have a letter
    from Yarrow Housing Limited of 26 July 2016 which sets out the  details
    of the sponsor's employment.  She has been employed on a permanent full-
    time basis with them since 7 February 2005 and refers to  her  earnings
    and the additional income she has.  Although we spent a  good  deal  of
    time on the mathematics of this it appeared that the figures ultimately
    fell slightly short of the ï¿½18,600 required under the Rules.  That  was
    not, as was emphasised by Mr Plowright and accepted by Ms  Everett,  an
    issue of concern to the decision maker and therefore  in  the  end  the
    point is an academic one and it seems to  me  that  the  appellant  had
    provided evidence of a kind sufficient to satisfy this  requirement  of
    the Rules.  It was not evidence that was before the decision maker  but
    it was something the judge  was  entitled  to  take  into  account  and
    therefore the first ground of challenge falls away on  the  basis  that
    the only document that was mandatory under the  Rules  was  a  document
    that had been provided by the appellant.

6.   The second issue then is that of the  genuineness  and  subsistence  of
    the relationship.  It is right, I think as Ms Everett says,  that  this
    is not the clearest of determinations but that being said  there  is  a
    good deal of consideration of the relationship in this case.  The judge
    set out in some detail the sponsor's evidence and also  noted  evidence
    from the appellant's sister as to the relationship.  There are numerous
    other letters from family members including from the appellant's mother
    confirming the nature and strength of the relationship and it seems  to
    me that it was properly open to the judge to find that the relationship
    was genuine and subsisting on that basis.

7.   The final issue  is  the  refusal  under  paragraph  320(11)  and  this
    concerns really what was said by the judge, in particular at  paragraph
    36, and I have set that out already.  It is perhaps  not  a  view  that
    would have been taken by every judge but I think it was a view that was
    open to the judge to take and the challenge to that is  in  my  view  a
    matter of disagreement only.  I should say also that as was accepted by
    Ms Everett the offence was in fact committed in 2006 as the judge said.
     The grounds got that wrong, it was a conviction that occurred in  2008
    after he had returned to the United Kingdom so the essence of the point
    there falls away and as I  say  I  think  the  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude as he did about 320(11) at  paragraph  36  in  particular  and
    therefore the challenge as set out in the grounds is not made  out  and
    the decision of the judge allowing this appeal therefore stands.

8.   No anonymity direction is made.
