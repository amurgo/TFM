                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr C H Ndubuisi, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent refused the appellant's  application  for  leave  as  an
    unmarried partner for reasons explained in her letter dated  14  August
    2015.

 2. The appellant gave notice of appeal to the FtT on 28 August  2015,  but
    her case did not come on for hearing until 7 September 2016.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Beach dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in her decision promulgated on 13 December 2016.

 4. The appellant's grounds of appeal are in her out  of  time  application
    for permission to appeal dated 14 March 2017 (which in terms of the  TP
    (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23 (1A), now stands as the notice  of  appeal  to
    the UT).

 5. The grounds say that the judge erred by  refusing  the  appeal  on  the
    single ground of the maintenance requirement; the appellant and sponsor
    had not led evidence about it because the point was not  taken  in  the
    decision;  the  sponsor  was  not  asked  about  the  �800  per   month
    transaction in his bank  account;  the  judge  should  have  given  the
    benefit  of  the  doubt;  the  sponsor  should  be  asked  for  further
    information  about  income;  the  appellant  and  sponsor  could   meet
    financial requirements through prospective employment  and  a  credible
    job offer to the appellant; permission should be  granted  "to  resolve
    this simple and narrow issue".

 6. [Although the point was not  mentioned  before  me,  reference  in  the
    grounds to the sponsor's bank account  and  income  appears  to  be  an
    error; it is the appellant's bank account and income which is meant.]

 7. In a decision dated 19 September 2017, the FtT extended time,  admitted
    the application, and granted permission.

 8. In a rule 24 response dated 3 October 2017 the respondent says that the
    judge was  entitled  to  find  that  the  appellant  had  not  provided
    sufficient evidence that she could be adequately maintained in the UK.

 9. On 23 October 2017, the appellant's current solicitors wrote to the  UT
    stating they had just been instructed, enclosing a statement  from  the
    appellant and a letter from her employers "which we will seek  to  rely
    on at the hearing".  Late lodging was due  to  their  being  instructed
    only on 18 October 2017 after  English  solicitors  advised  they  were
    unable to appear.

10. At the hearing Mr Ndubuisi sought to rely also on bank statements  from
    19 September 2014 to 20 March 2015, showing 6 payments credited of �800
    each, the source being shown as "Edinburgh Accommodation Loan".

11. The statement from the appellant, dated 20 October 2017, says  she  was
    employed from April 2013 to December 2015 "by Thistle House - Edinburgh
    Accommodation Ltd fro April 2013 to December 2015  ...  part  time  ...
    receiving a wage of approximately �800 per month paid at times in  cash
    and bank transfer .. I submitted my bank statement with my  application
    which shows wage paid ... the judge did  not  take  this  into  account
    ....".

12. A letter from "Edinburgh Accommodation Ltd t/a The Thistle House" dated
    19 October 2017 is to similar effect.

13. The main points for consideration arising from the  submissions  by  Mr
    Ndubuisi were these:

      i) The appellant had been led to believe by  her  previous  solicitors
         until recently that  they  could  appear  for  her  at  the  UT  in
         Scotland.




     ii) There was before the FtT the respondent's bundle, p.D1, appellant's
         bank statement March to June 2015, 3 months [this shows 3  payments
         of �800.00].



    iii) There was also at p.57 of the appellant's bundle her bank statement
         September to December 2015 [which shows no similar payments].



     iv) The bank statement now tendered was to fill in  the  gap  and  show
         income over a 6-month period.



      v) The appellant made her application to the respondent  under  rushed
         circumstances regarding curtailment of her leave,  wrongly  brought
         about by the respondent, as stated in the covering letter with  her
         application.  She asked for evidential flexibility to be applied if
         there were any shortcomings.



     vi) It was accepted that the grounds of appeal placed  before  the  FtT
         were unclear and confused.



    vii) The error of law by the FtT was that it did not take account of the
         income of �800 per month which would have been enough to prove  the
         appellant's and her partner's ability to maintain  and  accommodate
         themselves.



   viii) The judge said at � 57, "The bank statements ... show  receipts  of
         �800.00 per month ... from Edinburgh  Accommodation  Loan.   It  is
         unclear to me whether these relate to employment ... or to  a  loan
         payment".  It was  an  error  of  unfairness  not  to  ask  for  an
         explanation.  The matter had not been queried  by  the  respondent.
         The judge's remarks were not based on evidence led  or  submissions
         made at the hearing.



     ix) There was also there an error of inadequacy of reasoning.



      x) A decision should be substituted, allowing the appeal.

14. Parties agreed that the appellant  might  have  succeeded  at  the  FtT
    hearing by evidence which she did not produce with her  application  to
    the respondent - although that would have to show her case was  a  good
    one at the date of application, not at any later date.

15. Mr Matthews accepted that if the appellant had proved income of �800.00
    per month as claimed, that would have been enough  to  show  compliance
    with the rules, and that although the  appeal  was  available  only  on
    human rights grounds, the rules in this area were of such a nature that
    her appeal should have been allowed.

16. The main points arising from the submissions by  Mr  Matthews  were  as
    follows:

      i) The appellant made an incomplete  application  to  the  respondent,
         which could not have succeeded.

     ii) It was not accepted that  the  respondent  had  responsibility  for
         that, but even if she did, the  appellant  had  a  long  time  from
         filing her appeal until the hearing to prepare her case.

    iii) In her application, the appellant made her  case  (incorrectly)  on
         benefits alone, not on income from employment.

     iv) The respondent had not waived any matter of proof  of  income.   In
         her application form (p.A18) and the covering letter the  appellant
         did not seek to rely on an income of �800.00 per month.  It was not
         before the respondent for consideration.

      v) The matter was not raised in the grounds of appeal to the FtT.

     vi) The matter not having been waived in advance by the respondent,  it
         was for the appellant to establish her case.

    vii) There was no error by the FtT on the case before it.

   viii) The appellant had not complied with the Procedure Rules or Practice
         Directions in respect of admission of evidence by the UT.

     ix) There was no good reason for discretion to be applied in her favour
         over non-compliance.

      x) There was no explanation for the evidence not being before the FtT,
         so the first limb of the test for admission of fresh  evidence  was
         not met.

     xi) There was no scope for any concept of evidential flexibility,  when
         the appellant ahd the chance to make her case in the FtT.

    xii) Even if the evidence were to  be  admitted,  the  FtT's  legitimate
         concern was not met, as even after  all  this  time  there  was  no
         explanation for all the payments appearing with the word "loan".

   xiii) The appellant failed to meet the rules, and the judge found against
         her on proportionality, outside the rules.  There was no  challenge
         to that alternative.

    xiv) As the appellant has the  option  of  a  further  application,  the
         outcome in any event could not be found disproportionate.

17. In reply, Mr Ndubuisi said it was the respondent who put the  applicant
    to a rushed application; she did have the chance to put  matters  right
    in the FtT, but both the FtT and the UT had the same powers to exercise
    evidential flexibility, and that should enable her to  make  her  case,
    even now; although a fresh application was open, and even in absence of
    a ground of challenge, it would not be proportionate to require that.

18. I reserved my decision.

19. The grounds are misleading in suggesting that the appellant  was  taken
    by surprise on proof of income.  There had been no waiver.  It was  for
    her to advance her case, and for the judge to evaluate it.

20. The judge's finding that she was not satisfied of  the  nature  of  the
    �800 monthly payments was a sound one, under any of the  various  legal
    heads of challenge - neither unfair, nor lacking an  evidential  basis,
    nor unreasoned.

21. The appellant makes no case for being excused from the requirements  of
    the  rules  and  practice  directions  governing  admission  of   fresh
    evidence.

22. If that stage were passed, the substantive legal tests for admission of
    fresh evidence are not met. There is no good reason  for  the  evidence
    not being before the FtT.

23. Even if the evidence were to be admitted, and even so  long  after  the
    matter was raised, it does not offer to meet the reason for the judge's
    legitimate doubt: why do the payments appear as a loan?

24. The respondent, the FtT and the UT have not  been  shown  to  have  any
    legal duty to invite the appellant to improve her case, based  on  some
    vague concept of evidential flexibility.

25. Even if the appellant was pressed into a rushed application,  and  even
    if the respondent  had  some  responsibility,  any  benefit  she  might
    reasonably have expected from that has long passed away.  She had  over
    a year to prepare her case for the FtT (and she could  have  approached
    the respondent in the meantime).

26. There is no scope for success on human rights grounds,  the  rules  not
    being met, in absence of a ground of appeal, and given the availability
    of another application to the respondent.

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

28. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
