Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Nicholson, Counsel, instructed by Bolton CAB
For the Respondent:    Ms Harrison (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan. On February 18,  2013  he
       was encountered by immigration officials  and  claimed  asylum.  The
       respondent refused his asylum  claim  on  February  27,  2015  under
       paragraph 336 HC 395 and the same day a decision was taken to remove
       him by way of directions under paragraphs 8-10 of schedule 2 to  the
       Immigration Act 1971.

    2. The appellant appealed the removal decision under section  82(1)  of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on March 18, 2015.

    3. His appeal came before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Chambers
       (hereinafter referred to as the Judge) on October 8, 2015 and  in  a
       decision promulgated on October 26, 2015 he dismissed his appeal  on
       all grounds.

    4. The  appellants  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  November  9,  2016
       submitting the Judge had erred in the  way  he  dealt  with  article
       15(c).

    5. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins  on
       July 8, 2016 on the ground it was reasonably arguable  that  a  more
       careful analysis of country evidence, identified to the  Judge,  was
       required. The matter came before me on October 18, 2016 and I  heard
       submissions from both representatives following which I  found  that
       there had been an error because the Judge had failed to  demonstrate
       any engagement with the material in the appellant's bundle which  it
       was argued would have required the Judge to have departed  from  the
       conclusions  of  AK  (Article  15(c))  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT
       00163(IAC).

    6. Having considered the record  of  proceedings  and  the  appellant's
       bundle that was before the  First-tier  I  was  satisfied  that  the
       appellant's counsel had  identified  thirty  three  different  pages
       that demonstrated conditions may have significantly  worsened  since
       AK was decided and I set aside the article 15(c) decision.


    7. I adjourned the matter for  further  evidence  and  submissions  and
       today both Mr Harrison and Mr Nicholson made submissions.


SUBMISSIONS


    8. Mr Harrison relied on the Tribunal decision of  AK  (Article  15(c))
       Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163(IAC) and submitted that despite the
       content of the recent Foreign and Commonwealth Advice on travel, the
       situation in Afghanistan had not  worsened  sufficiently  to  engage
       article 15(c).

    9. Mr Nicholson submitted that there was good reason to depart from  AK
       (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT  00163(IAC)  because  the
       evidence demonstrated that the level of indiscriminate violence  was
       sufficient to engage article 15(c). The landscape in Afghanistan had
       changed  considerably  since  AK  as  the  level  of  fighting   had
       increased, IS had been established both in Agghanist and and  around
       the world and the UK Government was advising all  of  her  nationals
       not to travel to Afghanistan.


   10. Whilst the decision of FA (Libya): art 15(c) (CG) [2016] UKUT  00413
       guidance on Libya nevertheless  the  Tribunal's  framework  provided
       assistance in this case. The Tribunal looked  at  the  situation  in
       Libya in that decision and gave guidance  on  how  to  approach  the
       changes. The Tribunal had regard to:


        a. The cessation of direct flights from the United Kingdom.
        b. The ebb and flow of fighting in Libya.
        c. The rise of Daesh.
        d. The issue of numerous reports  and  advice,  not  least  by  the
           Foreign and Commonwealth Office.


   11. Mr Nicholson relied on the documents in the appellant's bundle which
       he submitted demonstrated the position had worsened with  levels  of
       violence rising, particularly, in Kabul; the rise in the  number  of
       casualties and the rise of Daesh. Reliance was placed on the  report
       of Dr Guistozzi which painted a  bleak  picture  of  Kabul.  The  UK
       government had recently publish an advice advising against travel to
       Afghanistan  and  there  were  two  recent  reports   from   Amnesty
       International and Human Rights Watch that supported  his  submission
       on the level of indiscriminate violence in Afghanistan.

   12. Mr Nicholson pointed to the original  bundle  of  documents  and  in
       particular pages 58, 160, 169-170, 175, 185,  225,  260,  262,  304,
       329, 332, 334, 422 and 423.


   13. Taking all of this evidence  he  submitted  the  appellant's  appeal
       should be allowed on humanitarian protection grounds.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   14. The issue for me today is a narrow issue but requires me to identify
       the Tribunal's conclusions in  AK  and  then  to  consider  the  new
       evidence that has been  submitted  and  whether  the  situation  has
       worsened to such an extent that article 15(c) is engaged.

   15. With regard to humanitarian protection the  appellant  has  to  show
       substantial grounds for believing that he would face a real risk  of
       serious harm as defined by paragraph 339C of the  Immigration  Rules
       or face a real risk of a breach of his protected human rights.

   16. Article 15(c) of Council Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the  Qualification
       Directive") defines serious harm within the Directive as:


       "serious and individual threat to a  civilian's  life  or  person  by
       reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of  international  or
       internal armed conflict."

   17. The Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") gave judgment in
       Diakitï¿½ (Case C-285/12) in which it was held that:


       "on a proper construction of Article 15(c) of Directive  2004/83,  it
       must be acknowledged that an internal armed conflict exists, for  the
       purposes of applying  that  provision,  if  a  State's  armed  forces
       confront one or more armed groups or if  two  or  more  armed  groups
       confront each other. It is not necessary  for  that  conflict  to  be
       categorised as 'armed conflict not  of  an  international  character'
       under international humanitarian law; nor is it  necessary  to  carry
       out, in addition to an appraisal of the level of violence present  in
       the territory concerned, a separate assessment of  the  intensity  of
       the armed confrontations, the level  of  organisation  of  the  armed
       forces involved or the duration of the conflict."


   18. The CJEU has highlighted  the  'exceptional  situation'  needed  for
       Article 15(c) to  apply  to  civilians  generally.  In  Elgafaji  v.
       Staatssecretaris van Justitie, C-465/07 at paragraph 37, the  Court
       made clear that, for this to be the case-

       '[...] the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed
       conflict taking place  ...  [must  reach]  such  a  high  level  that
       substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian, returned
       to the relevant country or, as the  case  may  be,  to  the  relevant
       region, would, solely on account of his presence on the territory  of
       that country or region, face a real risk  of  being  subject  to  the
       serious threat referred in Article 15(c) of the Directive.'


   19. The level of violence has to be assessed by its quantity as well  as
       by its quality. There can be no doubt that a substantial quantity of
       violence is a necessity without which  subsidiary  protection  shall
       not be granted. However, defining the threshold of Article 15(c)  is
       not a simple matter of analysing quantitative data. Three principles
       govern this assessment:

 a. First,  the  approach  must  be  holistic  and  inclusive.  Courts  and
    Tribunals must take into account a wide range of relevant variables.


 b. Second, Courts and Tribunals should not limit themselves  to  a  purely
    quantitative analysis of figures of civilian death  and  injuries  etc.
    The  approach  must  be  qualitative  as  well  as  quantitative.  When
    assessing quantity and quality, courts and  tribunals  should  bear  in
    mind the likelihood of unreported incidents and other uncertainties.


 c. Third, building on the case law, Courts and Tribunals  should  look  in
    particular to see what the evidence tells us about  the  indicators  of
    situations of violence and conflict (the following is intended as a non-
    exhaustive list):

        i.  The  parties  to  the  conflict  and  their  relative  military
           strengths and regard should be had to  methods  and  tactics  of
           warfare applied (risk of civilian casualties); type  of  weapons
           used; the geographical  scope  of  the  fighting  (localised  or
           widespread) and the number  of  civilians  killed,  injured  and
           displaced as a result of the fighting.


       ii. The ability or lack of it by the State to protect  its  citizens
           against violence (where practicable, it will assist to  set  out
           the various potential actors of protection and to address  their
           actual role)/the degree of State failure).


      iii. Socio-economic conditions (which should  include  assessment  of
           economic  and  other  forms  of  assistance   by   international
           organisations and NGOs).


       iv. Cumulative effects of long lasting armed conflicts.

   20. The starting point  in  any  Afghan  article  15(c)  appeal  is  the
       decision of AK which reviewed the previous decision of  GS  (Article
       15(c): indiscriminate violence) Afghanistan CG [2009] UKAIT 00044.

   21. I  am  concerned  with  whether  developments  since  AK  require  a
       different answer to be given to the question of generic risk arising
       under Article 15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive.  I  have  to
       analyse such matters as:


      a. whether the violence employed by the parties  to  the  conflict  is
         characterised by systematic targeting of civilians on a wide scale;




      b. whether, for example, the violence employed by the insurgents, when
         they have targeted civilians,  focuses in  large  part  on  certain
         categories of civilian only; and


      c. whether  when  the  insurgents   target  particular  categories  of
         civilians they routinely cause heavy "collateral" harm to  civilian
         lives and property.  None of  these  observations  is  intended  to
         underplay the terrible toll the "Long War"  is  inflicting  on  the
         Afghan population; on  the  contrary,  it  is  to  ensure  that  in
         deciding the Article 15(c) question, due  regard  is  paid  to  all
         relevant aspects.


   22. Dr Guistozzi gave evidence in both GS and AK  and  the  Tribunal  in
       both appeals criticised his reports. In GS the  Tribunal  found  his
       report to be of limited value and in AK the  Tribunal  commented  at
       paragraph [176]:

       "As regards the passages in  his  report  that  address  the  general
       situation in Afghanistan in terms of the level of violence  and  risk
       on return, we attach significant weight to them although it  remains,
       of course, for us to consider their purport in  the  context  of  the
       evidence as a whole (which includes far more detailed and up to  date
       sets of figures than those to which he refers).


       It would have assisted if his report could have explained whether and
       to what extent the opinion he expresses in it about the situation  in
       Kabul is different from that he gave in the Norwegian LANDINFO report
       of September 2011.


       It would also have assisted if his treatment of likely  accommodation
       problems facing returnees to Kabul had not assumed that for a  single
       man such as the appellant there would not be the option of sharing  a
       flat or rooms or quarters."


   23. In the report prepared  for  this  Tribunal  Dr  Guistozzi  spent  a
       considerable part of his report discussing Nangarhar but Mr Harrison
       made clear in his concise submissions that only return to Kabul  was
       proposed. The Tribunal has sought to make clear that it is necessary
       to look beyond mere figures and I note  that  large  parts  of  this
       report reiterates what the position was before AK albeit the  report
       does comment on the situation post  AK.  He  reports  that  in  2015
       insurgent attacks were 50% higher than in 2012 and the  numbers  for
       2016 were similar and that these increases were in the main  due  to
       renewed fighting from the Taliban. In discussing  the  situation  in
       Kabul he reported that the Taliban had started to target  government
       officials  and  members  of  the  security  forces.   Dr   Guistozzi
       constantly referred to targeted assassinations in his report and the
       deployment of truck bombs and an escalation of terrorist attacks  in
       Kabul city. However, despite some of his gloomy  observations  there
       is nothing in his report that would support a  submission  that  the
       appellant would face any  substantially  increased  risk  in  Kabul.
       Other areas of Afghanistan may well be displaying sizable  increases
       in insurgent attacks and if the respondent intended  to  return  the
       appellant to Nangarhar then  this  report  may  have  been  of  some
       assistance. Dr Guistozzi referred in paragraph [9] to an increase in
       indiscriminate violence but there is  nothing  in  his  report  that
       persuades me to depart from the position in AK.

   24. Mr Nicholson does not rely soley on this report and as stated  above
       he has put before the Tribunal a large  number  of  articles  albeit
       fewer than those relied on by his learned colleague, Mr Brown.


   25. I turn to that evidence and have considered those documents  in  the
       original bundle identified by Mr Nicholson. However, most  of  those
       articles are concerned with parts of Afghanistan  other  than  Kabul
       and even where the articles do refer  to  instances  in  Kabul  they
       appear to be targeted attacks. I summarise these reports as follows:


    a. A Taliban attack on a hotel that killed 14 in May 2015.  This  hotel,
       according to the article, was a "highly secured facility" and  killed
       mainly foreigners. This attack appears to  be  one  of  the  targeted
       attacks identified by Dr Guistozzi.


    b. A United Nations Report commented on  the  period  between  September
       2010 to December 2014 and the effect  it  had  on  children  but  the
       identified pages contain little  to  assist  me  when  considering  a
       return to Kabul city.


    c. A Taliban attack on an EU police training  convoy  killing  three  in
       Kabul in May 2015. The attack did kill  two  bystanders  as  well  as
       killing a security contractor and injuring a number of  others.  This
       attack appears to be one of the targeted  attacks  identified  by  Dr
       Guistozzi.


    d. A United Nations report indicates that in the first  four  months  of
       2015 1,000 civilians were killed in  the  conflict.  No  numbers  for
       Kabul are provided.


    e. A review entitled "South Asia Intelligence Review"  dated  July  2015
       identified the gains being  made  by  Islamic  State  in  Afghanistan
       specifically in Nangarhar Province.


    f. A Voice of America report dated August 5, 2015 reiterated an increase
       in civilian deaths in Afghanistan and in particular targeted killings
       of civilians perceived to be supporting the  government.  The  report
       makes no specific comment on Kabul.


    g. UNHCR reports confirm much of what is reported by other  articles  as
       set out above.


    h. Radio Free Europe reported a spate of bomb attacks on August 7,  2015
       in Kabul. These deaths marked the first major attack since the  death
       of the Taliban leader. Two  of  the  three  incidents  were  targeted
       attacks on a police academy and at Camp Integrity.


    i. Voice of America Report and United Nations article reported a suicide
       bomb attack on a Nato convoy on August 22, 2015.

   26. Mr Nicholson has brought to my attention  more  recent  articles.  I
       have considered these reports as well and comment as follows:

        a.  Amnesty  International  Report  dated  February  24,  2016-This
           article confirms similar figures to those in the original bundle
           but once again this article is not about Kabul.


        b. Human Rights Watch Report January 27, 2016-as before this  is  a
           generalised article which fails to report that the incidents  on
           August 7, 2015 in Kabul were attacks on Nato convoys.


        c. Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Report  dated  January  9,  2017-The
           article advises against travel to many provinces in Afghanistan.
           Anything but essential travel to  the  city  of  Kabul  and  all
           districts (other than Surobi) is  not  recommended.  It  reminds
           people that hotels and guesthouses used by foreigners can become
           targets.


   27. Mr Nicholson invited me to adopt the approach set out in FA (Libya):
       art 15(c) (CG) [2016] UKUT  00413.  I  have  done  this  but  having
       considered all of the material I was invited to consider  I  am  not
       persuaded the situation in Kabul has worsened  to  the  extent  that
       article 15(c) would be  engaged.  Large  parts  of  Afghanistan  are
       unsafe  but  based  on  the  material  I  was  given  I  reject  the
       appellant's application for humanitarian protection.

DECISION

   28. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I set aside  the  decision
       on humanitarian protection grounds and I have remade that decision.

   29. I dismiss the appellant's application for humanitarian protection.
