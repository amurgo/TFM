                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                                  JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



       JUDGE HANSON: The remaining parties in the judicial review claim,  as
       Mrs Perveen's child who was named as a dependant in  her  application
       was effectively removed from the proceedings at the  very  outset  as
       this is a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) issue, are  Sajida  Perveen  and  Ali
       Sher, not related according to the information  that  we  have  other
       than through family friendship/ association back in their  home  area
       in Pakistan but who applied to the Secretary of State  for  leave  to
       remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  under  the  points-based
       system as an entrepreneur team.


2.   In relation to Mrs Perveen her immigration  history  is  summarised  in
       the Secretary of State's impugned decision in respect of her dated  6
       May 2014 which shows that on 25 September 2008 she was granted  leave
       to enter the United Kingdom as a student valid until 31 December 2009
       which was extended to 17 April 2011 in the same capacity.  On 17  May
       2011 Mrs Perveen was granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom as
       a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until 17 May 2013. On 31 May  2013  Mrs
       Perveen applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1
       (Entrepreneur) Migrant which was refused.


3.   The summary of the immigration  history  of  Mr  Sher  appears  in  the
       impugned decision relating to his case dated 2 May 2014  which  shows
       that on 10 June 2006 he was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom
       as a student valid to 31 October 2007 which was extended in the  same
       capacity to 30 November 2010.  On 19 October 2010 Mr Sher was granted
       leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1  (Post-Study  Work)
       Migrant valid until  19  October  2012  and  on  24  April  2013  his
       application for leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
       was refused.


4.   The applications leading to the  impugned  decisions  were  made  on  7
       February 2014. The claimants were interviewed in  relation  to  those
       applications at Falcon House in Sheffield on 24 April  2014.   It  is
       said that notwithstanding the difference in the dates of the impugned
       decisions, one 2 May the other 6 May 2014, as the issues  are  common
       to the parties were both considered on the same day, a matter I shall
       refer to later on in the judgment.


5.   Following the issue of the judicial review claim the  matter  initially
       came before me on the papers in February of 2015.  Within the  papers
       was a request for the matters to be linked  on  the  basis  that  the
       claimants were members of  a  Tier  1  entrepreneur  team,  that  the
       grounds for refusal were common and that the issues at large  between
       the parties were common issues.


6.   A direction was given linking these two matters and providing  for  the
       notes of the interview records that were  conducted,  which  had  not
       been disclosed according to the information provided by the applicant
       at that stage, to be  disclosed  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   The
       interview records were disclosed and  the  matter  subsequently  came
       before Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley on the papers for  consideration
       of whether permission should be granted to bring  a  judicial  review
       claim.


7.   By an order sealed by the Tribunal on  27  April  2015  Judge  Chalkley
       refused permission to bring judicial review.  A  renewed  application
       for an oral permission hearing  was  made  and  listed  before  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Rintoul, who, having considered all the documents that
       were made available and having heard the submissions from  Dr  Morgan
       of Counsel on behalf of the applicants and Mr  Flynn,  instructed  by
       the Government Legal Department on behalf of the Secretary of  State,
       at a hearing on 19 June 2015, granted permission  to  bring  judicial
       review proceedings, in part.


8.   The basis of the grant is as follows:


           "(1)   I consider that it  is  arguable  that  the  respondent's
                  evaluation of the applications was flawed by proceeding on
                  the basis that Mr Rehan  was  not  a  director  of  Flight
                  Searches Limited.  Such an evaluation (if true, which  the
                  respondent appears to have believed to be the case)  would
                  indicate some level of dishonesty.   It  is  not  properly
                  arguable that this evaluation was not taken  into  account
                  in the assessment  of  the  applications  which  were,  in
                  effect, joint.


           (2)     It  is  arguable  also  (grounds  1  and  2)  that   the
                  applications should have been considered together;  it  is
                  also arguable that in light of (1) above, the respondent's
                  approach to the issue is arguably irrational.


           (3)    I refuse permission on ground 4.  It is wholly unarguable
                  that the respondent's decisions infringed Article 1 of the
                  First Protocol of the Human Rights Convention.  Permission
                  to appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  that  point  is
                  refused."


9.   Costs were reserved and Judge Rintoul gave case  management  directions
       one of which is very specific to the  issues  in  this  case  in  the
       following terms:


           "1.    The applicants must reformulate their grounds,  including
                an adequately particularised ground relating to the evidence
                about Mr Rehan, these new grounds to be served on the  Upper
                Tribunal and on the respondent  within  seven  days  of  the
                issue of these directions."


       The reason for such direction is because the grounds advanced  by  Dr
       Morgan before Judge Rintoul are said to  be  substantially  different
       from the original grounds on which permission for a  judicial  review
       were initially pleaded.  For this reason it  was  necessary  for  the
       Tribunal at the outset of this hearing to spend some  time  with  the
       parties considering the issues upon which this Tribunal  is  required
       to make a ruling.


10.  The Tribunal is grateful to the parties,  those  who  have  always  had
       conduct and those who had been instructed very late in the  day,  for
       the efforts that were made to ensure that all the necessary documents
       were available and before this Tribunal.  As a result it was possible
       to have meaningful discussion, to comment upon and look at  a  number
       of points which required clarified, or to clear the decks, if  I  may
       use that phrase, in relation to issues that needed to  be  considered
       in further detail.


11.  I will  go  through  the  list  of  issues  that  were  raised  on  the
       applicants' behalf precisely because they were not here at that  time
       (having arrived late) which will give them a flavour of the decisions
       that were made.  I refer to a document drafted by  Dr  Morgan  headed
       "Applicants' List of Issues".


12.  The first issue that it is suggested should be considered  was  whether
       Paul Martin, an executive officer of the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department, is to be ordered to be  produced.   It  is  accepted
       that ordinarily in judicial review proceedings oral evidence  is  not
       taken although I accept that where a decision depends upon a  factual
       dispute between the parties it may be appropriate for  oral  evidence
       to be heard.  In this case, if Mr Martin was  to  be  called  it  was
       anticipated there  would  have  been  some  form  of  application  or
       justification and if necessary a production  order  could  have  been
       made.


13.  To be fair to Dr Morgan,  during  the  course  of  the  discussions  in
       relation to this matter, he did indicate that he  had  advised  those
       instructing  him  to  make  such  an  application  but  there  is  no
       indication I have seen of such an application having been  made  that
       was granted.  The position  was  therefore,  at  the  outset  of  the
       hearing, that there is no production order  or  application  made  to
       request or compel Mr Martin to come before the Tribunal.


14.  As a result the second issue, whether Counsel for the  applicants  will
       be permitted to cross-examine Mr Martin, is academic  as  he  is  not
       here  and  there  is  no  order  that  he  should  be  produced.   No
       application to adjourn was made on the morning and in  the  interests
       of justice and the overriding objective it is very  unlikely  on  the
       facts of this matter that one would have been granted.


15.  Dr Morgan then raised question 3, the question of whether  reliance  is
       to be placed upon the witness statement of  Paul  Martin  as  written
       evidence.  It is important at this stage that I make quite clear that
       quite a lot of additional evidence has been  provided  in  accordance
       with the direction of Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  and  that  the
       direction of Judge  Rintoul  specifically  makes  provision  for  the
       parties to provide to the Tribunal documentary evidence that they are
       intending to rely upon.


16.  The filing of the witness statement of Paul Martin by the Secretary  of
       State is in accordance with  that  direction  and  is  an  admissible
       document.  It is for Ms Walker to decide which parts of her case  she
       is seeking to rely upon but she clearly indicated in her  submissions
       and in her skeleton argument that she does  seek  to  rely  upon  the
       evidence of Mr Martin.  As with other admissible evidence, the weight
       to be given to Mr Martin's statement is a matter for  this  Tribunal.
       Dr Morgan has invited the Tribunal to put little or  no  weight  upon
       that evidence and the weight that has been  attributed  to  it  is  a
       matter I will come on to shortly.


17.  Question 4 is whether the Secretary of State  should  be  permitted  to
       rely upon two case record sheets disclosed by the Secretary of  State
       in accordance with  Judge  Rintoul's  direction.   The  objection  is
       summed up in the final five words of question 4, which is whether the
       respondent should be permitted to rely upon the  case  record  sheets
       given the extensive redaction.  Redaction in  documents  produced  by
       the Secretary of State is a common phenomenon and there may  be  very
       good reasons why certain parts of a document should not be disclosed.
        Dr Morgan, for example, accepted that  where  the  identity  of  the
       individual caseworker  is  shown  it  may  not  be  appropriate,  for
       security or other reasons, that this information is put in the public
       domain.


18.   It  is  difficult,  and  I  do  understand  Dr  Morgan's   point   and
       frustration, in trying to defend a case where it appears that a large
       chunk of the evidence that the Secretary of State  has  knowledge  of
       her is not known which the position that this Tribunal is in too.


19.  The Secretary of State's position is that documents  were  produced  in
       redacted form because the redacted information is protected by  legal
       professional privilege.  That is a concept that is understood by  the
       lawyers in this court and for the benefit of the applicants it  is  a
       concept that allows communication between parties and  internally  to
       be undertaken to facilitate proactive case management  of  settlement
       of cases and identification of issues where  the  contents  of  those
       discussions particularly in relation to solicitor - client or  client
       adviser - parties discussions should  not  be  put  into  the  public
       domain.


20.  Documents that are said to be not disclosable on  the  basis  of  legal
       professional privilege can of course be subject to challenge  and  an
       application could have been made to this Tribunal by the  applicants'
       solicitors asking for the document to be produced in  an  un-redacted
       form, in which case the claim  the  content  is  protected  by  legal
       professional privilege could have been examined.  No such application
       was made.  The Secretary of State's position that  the  redaction  is
       based upon legal professional privilege has  not  been  shown  to  be
       unlawful  or  unreasonable  in  all  the  circumstances  and  so  the
       documents that we have are in the form that they have been presented.


21.  The question is whether the respondent  should  be  permitted  to  rely
       upon the two case sheets.  The  Secretary  of  State  can  only  rely
       effectively on those where  there  is  something  to  rely  upon.   A
       redacted statement cannot be relied upon unless Ms Walker was to tell
       us what that is, in which case by doing so she would have waived  the
       privilege that she seeks to rely upon.   So  far  as  this  point  is
       concerned the Secretary  of  State  is  entitled  to  rely  upon  the
       evidence that has been disclosed.  The weight to  be  given  to  that
       evidence is a matter for this Tribunal.


22.  In relation to question 5, whether the  two  applicants  applied  on  7
       February 2014  as  a  entrepreneurial  team  even  though  they  were
       required to make individual applications,  what  is  clear  from  the
       facts as accepted by the parties is that this is  an  application  in
       relation to a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Points Based System matter by two
       individuals  who  are  co-directors  in  Focus  Management  Solutions
       Limited.  It is quite clear in the  decision,  and  a  point  in  the
       statement made by Paul Martin, that in the  decision  making  process
       they were treated as an entrepreneurial  team  by  the  Secretary  of
       State.  Whether the process that was followed  by  the  Secretary  of
       State was irrational or unlawful is a matter  I  shall  comment  upon
       shortly.


23.  Question 6, whether their previous lack of success in the eyes  of  the
       Secretary of State with Time Security  Systems  Limited  damaged  the
       joint application or showed experience and determination, is a matter
       that I shall comment on in due course.


24.  Question 7, whether the respondent  properly  applied  the  Immigration
       Rules of 4 April 2014 to 5 May 2014 to the first  applicant  and  the
       Immigration Rules of 5 May 2014 to 13 June 2014  to  the  second  and
       whether there was any difference in  the  provision,  has  also  been
       raised.


25.  Two points arise from that.  Firstly the evidence of the  Secretary  of
       State's witness is that these decisions were made on the same day and
       the same Rules were applied.  That is  the  content  of  Ms  Walker's
       argument in her skeleton document.  So far as the second part of that
       question, whether there was any difference in  provision  that  is  a
       matter for the applicants to prove.  No evidence has been adduced  to
       show that there is any material difference between the provisions  of
       the Rules applicable, namely 245DD.


26.  Even if it  was  necessary  to  apply  two  separate  versions  of  the
       Immigration Rules the burden is upon the applicant to make  it  clear
       which version of the Rules they are saying should be applied  and  if
       there is a change that it makes any material difference.  It has  not
       been established that  the  Secretary  of  State  applied  the  wrong
       Immigration Rules in relation to this matter.


27.  Question 8, whether the applicants made a joint application  which  was
       treated as two separate applications by the respondent, that  repeats
       a matter raised earlier which  I  shall  comment  upon  shortly  when
       discussing the process.


28.  Question 9, whether the respondent failed to  apply  properly  whatever
       Immigration Rules were  applied  by  failing  to  take  into  account
       positive factors such as the �50,000 in  the  joint  account  and  by
       concentrating upon allegedly negative factors such as the  change  of
       the business as maintained in ground 2.  That is  a  matter  that  is
       considered during the course of  the  substantive  decision  which  I
       shall come to shortly. If the Secretary of State was only required to
       concentrate on positive factors, i.e. which  elements  of  the  Rules
       could be met, of which in fact there are  some  which  are  commented
       upon in relation to this matter, to the  exclusion  of  all  negative
       factors the Secretary of State would not be  doing  the  job  she  is
       charged to do by Parliament when  considering  these  matters  or  by
       authority  conferred  on  the  Secretary  of  State  for   the   Home
       Department.  The reason for that is simply this: the burden  is  upon
       the appellant who makes an application for a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
       visa  to  satisfy  the  Secretary  of  State  on   the   balance   of
       probabilities that he or she is able to meet the requirements of  the
       Immigration Rules.  What the decision maker is therefore tasked  with
       doing is, having  considered  all  available  relevant  evidence,  to
       establish whether  that  evidence  shows  that  the  applicants  have
       discharged that burden.  It is necessary as part of that  process  to
       focus upon the negative as well as the positive although  whether  an
       application fails will be because  of  those  negative  factors.   It
       cannot therefore be unlawful for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  take
       negative factors into account although I accept the  submission  made
       by Dr Morgan that when the decision maker is assessing whether  those
       requirements have been met, it is  necessary  to  have  an  open  and
       balanced mind and ot just look at the negative to  the  exclusion  of
       the positive unless there is very good reason to do so.


29.  Question 10, whether the Secretary of State failed to  properly  assess
       the evidence ascertained in the separate interviews, I shall  comment
       upon shortly, whether  the  respondent  acted  unfairly  towards  the
       applicants when one officer briefed two others inaccurately regarding
       Mohammed Rehan's contact  I  shall  refer  to  shortly,  whether  the
       respondent sought to undermine the applicants' permission through the
       supplementary letters of 15 August 2015, point 12,  has  no  arguable
       merit.


30.  The chronology of events is very important in relation to this  matter.
        It is a relevant part  of  the  decision  making  process  that  the
       Secretary of State  believed  that  Mr  Rehan,   Director  of  Flight
       Searches Limited who signed  the  contract  that  I  shall  refer  to
       shortly with the  applicants'  company,  had  no  legal  capacity  to
       contract on behalf of the company as he had ceased to be  a  director
       in 2012.  The  applicants  have  established  that  that  belief  was
       erroneous.  That was a substantial part of the case that  was  argued
       before Judge Rintoul and is  behind  the  first  of  Judge  Rintoul's
       reasons for granting permission that I referred to earlier.


31.  The Secretary of State, as in fact Dr Morgan acknowledged, is  under  a
       constant obligation to review a case and frequently if permission  is
       granted does undertake a review of the case to ascertain  whether  in
       light of matters a court or  Tribunal  have  identified  a  different
       decision should be made or a consent order should  be  entered  into.
       In this case the Secretary of State did not undermine  the  grant  of
       permission  actions  in  the  interim  as  alleged.   The  grant   of
       permission stands. That is why we are here today.  What the Secretary
       of State did was correct the error that had been made in the  earlier
       decision in relation to the understanding  vis-�-vis  the  status  of
       Mohammed Rehan in that it was acknowledged in the  subsequent  letter
       that Mr Rehan did not cease to be a director of the relevant  company
       as stated in 2012 and,  more  importantly,  the  Secretary  of  State
       confirmed her position generally  which  was  the  position  she  has
       always maintained which is that although that was an issue  that  was
       made known to the interviewing officers and is an issue that  appears
       in the notices, the reason the impugned  decision  was  made  in  the
       terms it is was not as a result of the contract signed by  Mr  Rehan.
       It was for far wider and more detailed reasons that I shall  look  at
       shortly.


32.  Question 13, whether the supplementary letter of 5 August  amounted  to
       a new decision governed by the Immigration Rules in force  when  that
       decision was made.  The supplementary letter did  not  make  a  fresh
       decision but acknowledged  the  Secretary  of  State's  mistake  made
       earlier and reaffirmed the Secretary of State's position in  relation
       to the reasons why the impugned decisions were made in the  way  they
       were which repeated the position that has been maintained throughout.
        For that reason there was no need for the grounds of challenge to be
       amended which they may have had to be had this been a fresh decision.
        That dealt with the list of the applicant's issues.


33.  There is a comment in the Secretary of State's documents that the  four
       grounds outlined by Dr Morgan in  his  skeleton  argument  and  mater
       raised in the papers exceed the two grounds on  which  Judge  Rintoul
       indicated he was granting permission to  bring  the  judicial  review
       claim.


34.  Having considered the four  grounds  it  is  clear  that  there  is  an
       interrelationship between some of the  grounds  and,  so  far  as  Ms
       Walker is concerned, that she was  not  prejudiced  by  the  Tribunal
       proceeding on the basis that grounds 1 to 4 in the skeleton  argument
       do in fact reflect the content of the three  issues  referred  to  by
       Judge Rintoul when granting  permission  to  bring  judicial  review.
       There is no ambush of Ms Walker and no surprise as she has  confirmed
       she is not prejudiced in relation to her ability to make  submissions
       in relation to all four grounds. We shall proceed on the  basis  they
       are the issues under consideration.


35.  There is no dispute between the parties  in  relation  to  the  correct
       legal provisions.  The Tribunal is grateful for the various copies of
       the Immigration Rules that have been provided.  The relevant Rule  is
       245DD and a copy of the version of the Rules in force at the date  of
       the impugned decision  is  included  within  the  applicants'  bundle
       commencing at page 54  of  the  bundle  that  the  Tribunal  received
       annexed to the letter from Elegant Solicitors of 17 February 2016.


36.  In relation to the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant route  -  the  purpose
       of that route is clearly set out in 245D(a) where  it  states:  "This
       route is for migrants who wish to establish, join or take over one or
       more businesses in the UK."  245DD sets out the requirements which an
       individual must show they are able to satisfy for leave to remain  in
       this capacity.  It is important to  remind  ourselves  of  the  first
       paragraph of that particular Rule which states that:


           "To qualify for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
           Migrant under this Rule, an applicant must meet the requirements
           listed below.  If the applicant meets these requirements,  leave
           to remain will be granted.  If the applicant does not meet these
           requirements, the application will be refused."


37.  Within the Rule the relevant sub-provisions for this case are  245DD(h)
       and (i).  245DD(h) states:


           "Except where the applicant has or was last granted leave  as  a
           Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, a business person or an innovator
           and is being assessed under Table 5 of Appendix A the  Secretary
           of State must be satisfied that:


           (i)    the applicant genuinely:


                  (1)  intends and is able to establish, take over or become
                      a director of one or more businesses in the UK within
                      the next six months, or


                  (2)  has established, taken over or become a  director  of
                      one or more businesses in the  UK  and  continues  to
                      operate that business or businesses; and


           (ii)   the applicant  genuinely  intends  to  invest  the  money
                  referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A in  the  business  or
                  businesses referred to in (i).


           ..."


38.  Subparagraph 245DD(i) states that:


           "In making the assessment in (h), the Secretary  of  State  will
           assess the balance of probabilities.  The Secretary of State may
           take into account the following factors:


           (i)    the evidence the applicant has submitted;


           (ii)   the viability and credibility of the source of the  money
                  referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;


           (iii)  the viability and credibility of the applicant's business
                  plans and  market  research  into  their  chosen  business
                  sector;


           (iv)    the  applicant's  previous  educational   and   business
                  experience (or lack thereof);


           (v)    the applicant's immigration history and previous activity
                  in the UK;


           (vi)   where the applicant has already registered in the  UK  as
                  self-employed or as the director of a  business,  and  the
                  nature of the business requires  mandatory  accreditation,
                  registration and/or insurance, whether that accreditation,
                  registration and/or insurance has been obtained; and


           (vii)  any other relevant factors."


39.  245DD(k) states:


           "If the Secretary of State is not satisfied with the genuineness
           of the application in relation to a  points-scoring  requirement
           in Appendix A, those points will not be awarded."


40.  As stated, the refusals are in similar terms.  After  setting  out  the
       immigration history, when looking at Mr Sher's refusal of 2 May 2014,
       the Secretary of State considered the non-points scoring reasons  for
       refusal.  The Secretary of State noted the nature of the  application
       and then made the following comment:


           "The Secretary of State is not satisfied that on the balance  of
           probabilities  Mr  Sher  genuinely  intended  and  is  able   to
           establish, take over  or  become  a  director  of  one  or  more
           businesses within the next six  months  and  that  he  genuinely
           intended to invest the money referred to in Table 4 of  Appendix
           A of the Immigration Rules in the  business  or  businesses  and
           that the money referred to in Table  4  of  Appendix  A  of  the
           Immigration Rules is genuinely available to him and will  remain
           available to him until such  a  time  as  it  is  spent  by  the
           business or businesses",


       thereafter there follows the definition of  the  term  "available  to
       you".


41.  In (ii) the decision maker comments upon the �50,000 in funds which  is
       stated has been made available.   Joint  bank  statements  have  been
       provided and the source of the funding accepted by the  Secretary  of
       State.  This is not a case in which the applicants are seeking  third
       party funding.  It is a case in which they themselves have  made  the
       sum of �50,000 available which is lodged in a business  bank  account
       with Barclays Bank PLC in the United Kingdom.   Having  set  out  the
       factual analysis with regard to funds the decision maker stated  they
       have limited concerns in this area.


42.  On page 3 of 7 of the refusal, at (iii), the decision  maker  considers
       the viability  and  credibility  of  the  business  plan  and  market
       research into the chosen sector.  It is clear that the nature of  the
       business venture is understood for the decision maker states:


           "You have stated that  your  intended  business  idea  is  Focus
           Management Solutions Limited - a  management  consultancy  firm.
           You state that your role is to deal with marketing  matters  and
           that your entrepreneurial team member  is  responsible  for  the
           financial side of the business.


           You have provided a business plan although it  is  fairly  basic
           and is mainly made up of  observations  regarding  the  business
           world and  improving  economy  and  generic  business  aims  and
           objectives.  There  is  very  little  in  the  way  of  specific
           explanations of what your  business  actually  is  and  how  you
           intend to achieve your objectives.  You  have  also  produced  a
           website",


       The address of the website is provided although  it  is  stated  that
       that is "incredibly basic".


           "At interview you were asked to explain what market research you
           conducted into your proposed business area.  You stated


                'we concluded that because at the first half of  2013  there
                were 90,000 new business set ups and they were  looking  for
                consultancy firms which can provide  them  advice  but  with
                small money so we realise that it is an ideal time to  start
                a consultancy firm'.


           This is nowhere near the level of research I would  expect  from
           somebody investing all of their savings into  a  business.   You
           have researched that there are an influx of start up  businesses
           who you assume will need cheap  consultancy  but  you  have  not
           conducted any  research  into  why  you  specifically  would  be
           successful in your local area.  I  am  therefore  not  satisfied
           that you have conducted in depth market research to  prove  that
           your proposed business will be successful.


           When asked how many other businesses exist in  your  local  area
           offering the same services you stated that 'there are  a  couple
           of firms/companies which provide the same services which we  are
           providing'.  I would have expected you to have  a  much  greater
           understanding of your local competition  and  this  again  shows
           that you have not conducted satisfactory market research.


           A quick search on the website www.yell.com shows that there  are
           151 management and business consultants  in  Bristol.   You  are
           therefore entering a hugely  crowded  sector  with  very  little
           experience.  In your business plan  you  acknowledge  that  'new
           consultancy firms tend to  get  ignored  by  local  clients  and
           regarded as inexperienced.'  There are therefore concerns  about
           the viability of your plans in your chosen business sector."


43.  Thereafter there follow the comments in relation to the  contract  with
       Flight Searches Limited based on two issues.  One is the question  of
       why the applicants would enter into a contract with a  company  based
       in London or why that company in London would employ  a  Brisol-based
       consultancy firm, and  a  statement  that  it  seems  an  unnecessary
       service for a travel agency who obviously exists  through  their  own
       ability to attract customers.  "These concerns therefore  bring  into
       doubt the validity of your only contract".


44.  There is thereafter comment upon the  expiry  of  leave  to  remain,  a
       comment that this is the second application for an entrepreneur visa,
       the first application having been made on 16 October 2012 and refused
       on 24 April 2013 as a team member of Mrs Perveen  and  that  although
       the business plan on that occasion was to set up a  security  systems
       company which failed on appeal the decision maker felt that that gave
       the impression that the applicant was desperately attempting anything
       to meet the entrepreneur Rules and remain in  the  UK  and  that  the
       current business idea is not a genuine idea which  they  intended  to
       implement long-term.


45.  The decision maker also states that concerns exist as a result  of  the
       speed in which the business was set  up  and  the  application  made.
       Appeal rights for the previous refusal became exhausted on 13 January
       2014, the new business was formed and registered on 21 January  2014,
       business plan created in January 2014 and the only contract which  is
       that with Flight Searches Limited was signed on 4 February 2014,  and
       the application for an entrepreneur visa made on 7 February 2014.  In
       the opinion of  the  decision  maker  this  was  an  incredible  fast
       turnaround for a business to be set up and gives the appearance  that
       it had been done hastily in order to  meet  the  entrepreneur  Rules.
       The decision maker states that based on  the  business  plan  and  on
       answers at interview he or she was not  satisfied  that  there  is  a
       viable or credible business  proposal  or  that  the  applicants  had
       undertaken credible  market  research  as  would  be  expected  of  a
       prospective entrepreneur.


46.  At (vi)  the  decision  maker  comments  upon  previous  education  and
       business  experience  or  lack  thereof,  acknowledges  the  academic
       qualifications held by the applicants which in relation to Mr Sher is
       a masters degree from the University of the West of  England  and  in
       his statement that he had  worked  as  a  marketing  director  for  a
       security firm and that he used to run a consultancy firm in Pakistan,
       although it is also noted that no evidence of that had been provided.
        It was accepted he has a  genuine  business  qualification  but  had
       demonstrated no  experience  of  working  in  his  intended  business
       sector, he had no experience of successfully setting up  and  running
       his own business and nor had he demonstrated any particular  business
       acumen.  The decision maker was therefore not satisfied that Mr  Sher
       had sufficient previous educational and employment experience in  the
       business area that he intended to start up in.


47.  In relation to the points-scoring element of the application no  points
       were awarded in relation to access to  the  funds  for  although  the
       �50,000 was shown to be available in the Barclays account it was  the
       opinion of the decision maker that for the reasons stated earlier  in
       the decision  under  the  heading  "Non-Points  Scoring  Reasons  for
       Refusal"  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  satisfied  as  to  the
       genuineness of the  application  and  in  accordance  with  paragraph
       245DD(k) of the Immigration Rules no  points  were  awarded  in  this
       area.


48.  In relation to Mrs Perveen the basis of refusal and the  points  raised
       are in identical terms but with  a  divergence  in  relation  to  Mrs
       Perveen's qualifications in that she came to the United Kingdom as  a
       Tier  4  (General)  Student  to  complete  a  diploma   in   business
       administration from London Reading College and a masters at  business
       administration awarded by Coventry University.  In  relation  to  her
       employment she had also stated that she had experience working  as  a
       team leader in a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet.  Again,  the  opinion
       of the decision maker was that this did  not  demonstrate  sufficient
       business acumen  or  sufficient  academic  or  practical  experience.
       Again, no points were awarded under the  points-scoring  element  for
       the same reasons that I have referred to in  relation  to  Mr  Sher's
       decision.


49.  The first issue  to  which  consideration  needs  to  be  given  is  by
       reference to the first ground advanced by Dr Morgan, namely that  the
       decision maker made an error of law in the refusals when  she  failed
       to consider the applications as joint applications.  It is  important
       in relation to this matter that there is a clear understanding of the
       nature of a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) application as  there  are  certain
       aspects of it that are unique and are not often seen in  relation  to
       other applications for leave.


50.  There is no  formal  requirement,  legal  or  otherwise,  for  a  joint
       application to be made by a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  team.   It
       is accepted that separate applications can be made and that it may be
       appropriate in  certain  circumstances  to  do  so.   Two  particular
       scenarios when  this  arises  are  firstly  if  one  of  the  Tier  1
       (Entrepreneur) team Migrants is in the United Kingdom and  the  other
       member of the entrepreneur team not in the United Kingdom  but  still
       remains  in  their  home  state.   There  is  no   restriction   upon
       applications being made by entrepreneurial team members from  out  of
       country and in country in this 'hybrid' manner.


51.  The second example may arise  where  the  entrepreneurial  team  member
       does not make their application at the same time.  This is  something
       that is often seen in documents that come before this Tribunal  where
       challenges are made.  There is no requirement for  such  applications
       of this nature to be made contemporaneously.  If  valid  applications
       are made on separate occasions they will come before a decision maker
       on the papers.  The expectation of the Secretary of  State  contained
       in her guidance to caseworkers is that if there  is  a  reference  to
       another entrepreneur partner or team member the applications will  be
       linked at the first available opportunity.


52.  The member of the respondent's staff, the caseworker who  is  examining
       the applications on the papers, has authority if  it  is  established
       that  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  can  be  met  to  grant  the
       applications and the visa sought for either leave to enter  or  leave
       to remain at that  stage.   If  concerns  arise  in  relation  to  an
       application the caseworker has a discretion to  call  the  applicants
       for interview. Paragraph 245DD makes it clear that  if  a  person  is
       called for interview they must attend and if they do fail  to  attend
       their application is likely to be refused.


53.  Therefore, at the point these applicants were called  to  interview  it
       must have been in the mind of the  decision  maker  that  there  were
       concerns arising from the information provided such as  the  business
       plan, the applications, and  this  case  the  history  that  required
       further investigation.


54.  There has been reference in the skeleton argument of Ms Walker  and  in
       the impugned decision to  the  previous  application  for  a  Tier  1
       (Entrepreneur) visa in relation to their proposed business  within  a
       security company.  That application  was  refused  with  a  right  of
       appeal. The appeal came before Judge Sullivan, a Judge of the  First-
       tier Tribunal sitting at Hatton Cross in London, on 15 November 2013.
        The judge examined the evidence and submissions that were  made  and
       concluded that the applicants had failed to discharge the  burden  of
       proof upon them to the required  standard  to  show  that  they  were
       entitled to the leave they were seeking even though  some  challenges
       to the adverse decisions were found in their favour.


55.  In paragraphs 32 and 33 of the determination Judge  Sullivan  made  the
       following findings:


           "32.   As oral evidence was  given  a  number  of  discrepancies
                  arose between the two  appellants.   These  concerned  the
                  number of business contracts the appellants'  company  has
                  and has had; the number of  employees  the  business  has;
                  what any employees do in the business and the sum invested
                  in the business.  These did in my view bring into question
                  whether the business is operating as claimed.


           33.    Given the gaps in the financial  evidence  provided  with
                  the applications and that satisfactory bank evidence (that
                  each appellant had access to the other's  funds)  was  not
                  made available to the respondent until after both refusals
                  I find that the refusals are both in accordance  with  the
                  law and the applicable Immigration Rules."


56.  There was, therefore, in the mind of the decision maker, the  Secretary
       of  State,  an  awareness  of  a  finding  by  the  judge   regarding
       discrepancies in evidence that had been given previously  and  issues
       in relation to the business plan that I shall  refer  to  in  further
       detail in due course.


57.  The fact the appellants were called for interview has  not  been  shown
       to be irrational or unlawful on the facts.  At this point I turn back
       to the statement of Paul Martin.  Paul Martin describes himself as an
       executive officer employed by UK  Visas  &  Immigration  ("UKVI")  in
       Sheffield authorised to make his statement on behalf of the Secretary
       of State for the Home Department,  stating  that  the  facts  in  the
       statement are true to his knowledge and belief.


58.  Mr Martin is an executive officer within Temporary  Migration  Team  11
       of UK Visas.  He sets out the  process  followed  by  UK  Visas  when
       considering applications for leave to remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
       Migrants made by team members.  He states  that  Temporary  Migration
       Team 11 is responsible for considering Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and Tier
       1 (General) balance of probabilities assessments  in  line  with  the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules and published guidance.


59.  The  following  specific  information  is  provided  pursuant  to  Rule
       245DD(h) of the Immigration Rules:


           "3.    Applicants for leave to remain as Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
                Migrants are required to  demonstrate  that  they  genuinely
                intend and are able to establish,  take  over  or  become  a
                director of one or more businesses in  the  United  Kingdom.
                The standard for assessing whether  an  applicant  genuinely
                intends  to  establish  a  business  is   the   balance   of
                probabilities,  as  set  out  in   Rule   245DD(i).    These
                assessments are referred to  as  'balance  of  probabilities
                assessments' or 'BOP assessments'.


           4.  My   responsibilities   include   undertaking   balance   of
                probabilities assessments for applications  that  have  been
                referred for an interview to establish the genuineness of an
                applicant's (or a team of applicants') business.  Reaching a
                decision  as  to  whether   the   balance   of   probability
                requirement outlined in paragraph 245DD(i) is  met  involves
                considering interview  transcripts  alongside  the  evidence
                that  applicants  have  provided   in   support   of   their
                application, together with the applications themselves.   In
                order to determine whether applicants are entitled to  leave
                to remain as part  of  this  consideration,  I  need  to  be
                satisfied that  the  applicants  meet  the  requirements  of
                paragraph 245DD(h) of the Immigration Rules.


           5. Whilst I am not involved in the initial  caseworking  process
                (prior  to  the  interview)  for   Tier   1   (Entrepreneur)
                applications,  I  understand  that  when  applications   are
                received from team members, they  are  given  separate  case
                reference numbers and files, but the standard practice is to
                keep  both  applications  together  and  to  interview  both
                applicants on the same day if there are concerns  about  the
                genuineness of their business.  When  both  applicants  have
                been interviewed, a written transcript of each interview  is
                linked to their respective applications  and  a  balance  of
                probabilities assessment is undertaken by the relevant  UKVI
                team, Temporary Migration Team 11.


           6. When undertaking a balance  of  probabilities  assessment  of
                Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applications that have been  submitted
                as  part  of  an  entrepreneurial  team  I  consider   their
                respective interview transcripts  in  conjunction  with  the
                documentary evidence provided  with  their  applications  to
                assess the genuineness of their joint business venture.  The
                balance of probabilities assessment is carried out  on  both
                entrepreneurial team members' applications at the same  time
                whenever possible.  This is because evidence  supplied  with
                each application and answers provided at interview relate to
                a business in which both applicants are  directors,  and  as
                such may contain information pertinent to both applications.
                 Moreover, any contradictions  in  information  provided  at
                interview are  relevant  to  the  balance  of  probabilities
                consideration.  Of course, sometimes it is not practical  or
                possible to consider the applications together, for  example
                where the application of one team member is  submitted  many
                months after the first, or where it is not submitted at all.


           7. I have been shown extracts of the  General  Case  Information
                Database in relation to  the  applicants'  applications  for
                leave to remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  in  both
                redacted  and  unredacted  form.   I  understand  that   the
                redacted version is being disclosed  to  the  court.   These
                records  show  that  a  typical  balance  of   probabilities
                assessment was carried out on 2 May 2015 in respect of  both
                applicants and  I  can  confirm  from  having  reviewed  the
                unredacted version of the  records  that  these  assessments
                were carried  out  by  the  same  caseworker,  who  was  not
                satisfied that either applicant was a genuine entrepreneur."


       The statement contains a statement of truth signed by Mr  Martin  and
       dated 5 August 2015.


60.  In relation to the submission by Dr Morgan that  little  weight  should
       be attached to this evidence I do  not  agree.   I  find  that  I  am
       entitled to attach due weight to it for although no oral evidence was
       given and no cross-examination was undertaken there are two or  three
       relevant aspects of this statement I have taken into account.


61.  The first is that the  gentleman  who  prepared  the  statement  is  an
       executive officer of the  Secretary  of  State  and  whilst  not  all
       officers of the Secretary of State have behaved in a manner that  one
       would expect of them within this jurisdiction over the  years,  there
       is no reason for me to doubt  that  this  officer  is  attempting  to
       mislead this Tribunal or the parties in any way whatsoever.


62.  The second point is that the statement is supported by a  statement  of
       truth in which the maker of the statement is clearly fully  aware  of
       the purpose of this statement, namely to  assist  the  Tribunal,  and
       confirms that the contents of the same are true.


63.   The  third  reason  is  that  the  information  contained  within  the
       statement, with the exception  of  that  specific  to  the  case,  is
       information which is already in the public  domain.   The  modernised
       guidance for Immigration Rules,  version  15  which  is  the  current
       version although not the version when the  decision  was  made,  sets
       out in clear terms the process that should be taken by  a  caseworker
       when in receipt of a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  statement.   It  has  not
       been shown that that guidance was in  any  different  form  when  the
       relevant decisions were  taken  or  the  procedure  set  out  by  the
       Secretary of State for assessing matters is contrary to any published
       guidance or policy.


64.  Comment was made during his submissions by Dr  Morgan  in  relation  to
       the process of the case having been considered by  a  caseworker  but
       the interviews with  both  applicants  being  conducted  by  separate
       individuals and not by the caseworker.


65.  I do not find that there is any merit  in  the  submission  that  as  a
       result of the process adopted by the Secretary of State the  decision
       is somehow irrational  or  unlawful.   How  the  Secretary  of  State
       organises those employed within her organisation is a matter for  her
       department.  It is clear that initial consideration of the  documents
       is undertaken  by  the  caseworker  and  the  caseworker  is  clearly
       understood  to  be  the  person   responsible   for   receiving   the
       application, considering the application and either referring it  for
       a grant at that stage or commencing the process for further enquiries
       to be undertaken.


66.  It is not irrational if that person has undertaken  an  examination  of
       the application on the papers, but finds there are issues of concern,
       that they note those issues in the appropriate document which is then
       passed on to the person who will conduct the interview.  I was  taken
       by Dr Morgan during the course of  his  submissions  to  the  Tier  1
       interview record  for  Mr  Sher  and  the  document  headed  "Tier  1
       Entrepreneur Interview Information Sheet".  This sets out the  nature
       of the individual to be interviewed,  the  type  of  case,  location,
       representatives, any special requirements, and then  contains  a  box
       saying "Risk assessment notes".  In that the caseworker has added the
       following text:


           "Biggest concern with this application is that the applicant and
           his team member (who previously applied together as a  team  but
           were refused) have set up  a  new  company  offering  completely
           different services.  When  they  applied  they  had  a  security
           company called Times Security Services Limited.  Now they've set
           up a company called Focus Management Solutions Limited which  is
           a management consultancy firm.  Both  companies  are  listed  as
           actively trading.


           Also concern over the contract supplied.   The  contract  states
           they will supply management consultancy services.   One  of  the
           services specified is listed  as  'to  gather  and  establishing
           contracts with prospective customers'.  The other company  named
           in the contract is a travel agency.  They don't  need  a  middle
           man to get their contracts - people contact a travel  agency  to
           book a holiday."


67.  Whilst I  understand  the  submission  made  by  Dr  Morgan  that  that
       suggests a negative stance being taken at the outset I  do  not  find
       such submission is made out.  The reason is that  if  the  caseworker
       was unable to write down why they want an interview  the  purpose  of
       the interview would not be known to the person who has been tasked to
       undertake it.  It is perfectly  appropriate  and  not  irrational  or
       unfair for the person who is requesting the interview to  make  known
       to the interviewer the reason why, especially if they are not one and
       the same person as indeed they were not in this case.


68.  In relation to whether the  applicants  should  have  been  interviewed
       together I accept the submission by Ms Walker in this case that where
       the issue is credibility and whether this is a  genuine  application,
       it is perfectly acceptable and indeed logical and  rational  for  the
       decision maker to conduct two separate interviews.  As stated  by  Mr
       Martin in his witness statement, where there are common  applications
       by common directors in relation to the same  business  conducting  an
       interview in that manner enables them to  give  evidence  that  shows
       that they are at one and ad idem in  relation  to  the  business  and
       issues  in  relation  to  the  business  or  possibly  identify   any
       contradictions and weaknesses.  It must be remembered,  and  I  refer
       back to the determination of  Judge  Sullivan,  that  on  a  previous
       occasion it has been found that these applicants when giving evidence
       have given contradictory evidence before a court of law.


69.  It has not been  made  out  that  there  is  any  legal  obligation  to
       interview the applicants together  and  choosing  to  interview  them
       separately does not mean that the Secretary of State  has  failed  to
       consider the application as a joint application.   The  Secretary  of
       State at the interview stage is  still  undertaking  the  information
       gathering process.


70.  Reference was also  made  by  Dr  Morgan  in  his  submissions  to  the
       recommendation    sheet    "Tier    1    (Entrepreneur)     Interview
       Recommendation".  It is clearly a document  aimed  at  the  interview
       setting out four issues that the interviewer is asked to consider and
       give their opinion on whether  the  applicant  genuinely  intends  to
       establish a business in  the  UK  within  the  next  six  months  and
       genuinely intends to invest the  money  available  to  them  in  this
       business and genuinely has the money available to them and  does  not
       intend to take up employment other than  as  an  entrepreneur.   That
       mirrors and reflects the requirements of the Rules.  In  the  section
       'Recommendation - credible - yes or no', the interviewer has  circled
       the word "no", not credible.


71.  Reasons are given based upon the answers  reflected  in  the  interview
       and Dr Morgan  in  his  submissions  suggested  that  some  of  those
       conclusions, referring to paragraphs 7, 12, 13 and  14,  are  on  the
       basis of the answers given themselves irrational.  It is stated  that
       the answers that were given  were  in  fact  proper  answers  by  the
       applicant who provided the information  in  response  and  that  this
       reinforces the negative and incorrect approach that has been taken in
       relation to the assessment of this matter.


72.  What is important to bear in mind is that at this stage,  although  the
       interviewing officer is asked to express an opinion, the decision and
       assessment of the merits of the claim are not  being  made.   If  the
       interviewing  officer  writes  down  information  that   appears   to
       reinforce the concerns of the caseworker there is a possibility there
       is good reason for that, namely that as  a  result  of  the  exercise
       undertaken there are concerns in  relation  to  the  ability  of  the
       applicant to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.


73.  What happened  in  relation  to  this  matter,  however,  is  that  the
       paperwork was then sent to a member of the Balance  of  Probabilities
       Team,  who,  having  considered  all  the  evidence,  came   to   the
       conclusions set out in the impugned decision that I have referred  to
       above.  I find no arguable legal error,  irrationality,  unlawfulness
       or perversity in relation to the process adopted by the Secretary  of
       State between the receipt of the applications by the  applicants  and
       the service of the impugned  decisions  with  the  exception  of  the
       admitted error in relation to the status of the  director  of  Flight
       Searches Limited.


74.  In relation to the Fight Searches Limited point I accept  the  position
       outlined in the  supplementary  refusal  letter  that  the  error  in
       relation to the capacity of the person making the contract was not  a
       determinative factor in the decision making process and therefore the
       acknowledgement that that point was made in  error  has  no  material
       effect on the outcome of the eventual decision.   Judge  Rintoul  did
       flag up whether it was arguable that  as  a  result  of  that  matter
       somehow the mind of the decision maker will be tainted by what on the
       face of it appears to be an issue of deceit, but it has not been made
       out to the required standard before me today or on the papers that  I
       have considered that the effect of the mistake had such a serious  or
       material effect upon the decision, such as to enable  the  applicants
       to succeed on that point.  The decision was wrong, that is  accepted,
       but no more.


75.  In respect of ground 1, in summary I do not accept that  the  Secretary
       of State failed to consider the  applications  properly.   I  do  not
       accept that they did not consider it as an application by joint  team
       members of a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) team.


76.  Ground 2 asserts that the respondent made an error in the refusals  and
       failed to apply properly the relevant Immigration Rules.   This  goes
       to  the  approach  taken  and  the  conclusions  reached   upon   the
       information that was available to the decision maker.  Dr  Morgan  in
       his submissions referred to the command paper  6741  "A  Points-Based
       System: Making Migration Work  for  Britain"  and  the  statement  at
       paragraph 11 of that document highlighted in the copy  provided  that
       the purpose of the Rules was to create:


           "A system whereby points will be awarded according to  objective
           and transparent criteria in order to produce  a  structured  and
           defensible decision making process.  Prospective migrants  will,
           prior to making their application, be able to assess  themselves
           against these criteria, reducing the number of  speculative  and
           erroneous applications."


77.  There is no merit in a challenge that the vires of Rule  245DD  can  be
       impugned in any way.  Challenges to the validity and compatibility of
       the Immigration Rules following the introduction of the  points-based
       system and changes introduced after July 2012 in relation to  private
       and family life have all to date, with few  exceptions,  failed  when
       challenged before the High Court.


78.  The statement in paragraph 11 is a statement to Parliament of what  was
       intended, dated March 2006, in relation to the  points-based  system.
       The points-based system has also been  considered  by  the  Court  of
       Appeal who acknowledged it to be prescriptive system in  relation  to
       which if an individual cannot meet the requirements of the Rules they
       are likely to fail.  The Court of Appeal  did  not  strike  down  the
       Rules and did not find that the Rules are  in  any  way  incompatible
       with statements  made  to  Parliament.   Indeed  the  Senior  Courts'
       criticism of the Immigration Rules has in the  past  been  that  they
       were not approved by Parliament.  The Secretary of State now  ensures
       that Immigration Rules are laid before and approved by Parliament.


79.  As a result, whatever may have been in a command  paper  in  2006,  the
       applicable  Rules  that  we  are  considering  in  relation  to  this
       application  had  been   approved   by   Parliament   and   reflected
       Parliament's view as to how the same were to be applied.


80.  The submission in ground 2  that  the  application  of  the  applicants
       should have been assessed against the totality of the relevant  Rules
       is correct, but not just  the  Rules.  The  evidence  that  was  made
       available also had to be considered with the same degree  of  anxious
       scrutiny.  The statement that the view of the  applicants  that  once
       they had met  the  heavy  financial  requirements,  i.e.  proved  the
       availability of the �50,000, they should have been considered as more
       likely to succeed than not, is a position I can understand from their
       perspective but having �50,000 available whilst demonstrating, as  Dr
       Morgan submitted, a clear intent in line with other  statements  they
       had made is not determinative of the fact they have an  intention  to
       establish a viable business.


81.  In the same way the fact they had rented office premises is  indicative
       of the claim to have a trading base, and supported their claim to  be
       in business, it was a three month lease that was  taken  on  serviced
       offices in Bristol. This in itself is  therefore  not  determinative.
       It is the series of evidential building blocks that had to  be  taken
       into account by the decision maker after  the  interview  process  to
       ascertain whether the  requirements  of  the  Rules  were  met.   The
       question is whether the assessment that was  undertaken  is,  in  any
       way,  perverse,  irrational  or  contrary   to   that   material   or
       demonstrates a lack of anxious scrutiny in the material provided.


82.  The starting point in the mind of the decision maker was  the  previous
       application that had been  made  and  which  had  been  refused.  The
       challenge to the refusal on  appeal  failed,  the  applicants  become
       appeal rights exhausted and then  made  another  application  shortly
       thereafter.  I understand Dr Morgan's  submission  that  there  is  a
       positive  aspect  to  that  as  it  demonstrated  an  intent  by  the
       applicants to set up a business as entrepreneurs  within  the  United
       Kingdom.  The Secretary of State's position is that  it  demonstrated
       no such genuine desire but rather a desire  to  stay  in  the  United
       Kingdom irrespective  of  whether  they  were  able  to  satisfy  the
       relevant Rules or not.


83.  In some respects this is not a key issue in itself.  There  is  nothing
       wrong with a person who fails with application A making application B
       provided it is a proper application that has been  shown  to  be  one
       that will succeed.  Had this been the case in the mind of the Balance
       of Probabilities Officer, in that had been shown  that  the  business
       plan, replies to interview and the facts generally supported the fact
       that what was proposed was a genuine business proposal for a business
       that had prospects of success,  then  any  refusal  just  based  upon
       "well, you made the application quickly, we do not  believe  you  are
       genuine" would likely to have  been  successfully  challenged  before
       this Tribunal.


84.  But that is not what the decision maker found and that is not what  the
       impugned decision states.  Whilst the speed by which the  application
       was made was clearly of concern to the decision maker the  assessment
       on  the  balance  of  probabilities  assessment  is  based   upon   a
       consideration of all the available material.


85.  One of the documents produced with the application is a business  plan.
        During the course of Dr Morgan's submissions, when we  touched  upon
       the documentary  evidence,  a  number  of  concerns  were  raised  in
       relation to the content of the business plan.  As Dr Morgan  properly
       reminded me during the course of the hearing, as indeed did Ms Walker
       when she made her submissions, it matters not what I think about  the
       nature of the evidence that was provided.  It matters not whether  on
       an appeal any different decision would be  made  because  this  is  a
       judicial review application where what is  being  considered  is  the
       process by which the application was  made,  not  the  merits  of  an
       appeal. As the applicants made the application when their  leave  had
       expired they do not, in fact, have a right  of  appeal  against  this
       decision.


86.  It is recognised, quite properly, that the business  plan  does  appear
       on the face of it to resemble the results  of  a  tick  box  exercise
       where issues that the Secretary of State was thought  to  require  to
       show  had  been  considered  and  to  demonstrate  that  fact   using
       appropriate business language and in a form that it is  suggested  by
       Dr Morgan demonstrates the commitment to business planning.


87.  This business plan, however, part of the  application  in  general  and
       not an exercise in form.   It  is  an  exercise  in  substance.   The
       purpose of a business plan is simply to establish that  the  proposed
       business is viable, the term "viable" in a business  sense  referring
       to the ability of a business to make  a  profit,  the  term  "profit"
       meaning that the  company's  income  and  revenues  will  exceed  its
       outgoings and expenses.


88.  The decision maker accepted that as Focus Management Solutions  Limited
       are a new company, and not a going concern that is being taken  over,
       there is no trading history  to  assist  in  the  assessment  of  the
       reality of the business proposal.  What is therefore required in  the
       information presented to the decision maker is a business  plan  that
       adequately demonstrated that the directors of the company,  i.e.  the
       applicants, have an appropriate approach to enable  the  business  to
       generate income and revenue.


89.   The  content  of  the  business  plan  should  have  answered  certain
       fundamental questions,  the  first  being:  can  it  be  done?   That
       required a clear  definition  of  the  products  and  services  being
       developed.  In this respect, in the executive summary of the business
       plan there is reference to the areas in  which  it  is  proposed  the
       business will function, namely finance,  ICT,  strategy  formulation,
       project management, market product overview  etc.   The  main  target
       appears to be a strata of businesses identified as 'SME',  small  and
       medium enterprises, using, as the applicants say, the basis of  their
       skills and practical experience to gain a local market share.


90.  The business plan should have indicated  the  need  for  such  product,
       i.e. what problem the product is solving and why  their  approach  is
       better than existing alternatives.  In this respect the business plan
       contains generalised statements regarding a number of new  start  ups
       identified  as  a  considerable  number  of  some  90,000,  with   no
       identification of where they are, whether that is a  national  figure
       or in the Bristol area.  One assumes that figure  must  be  national,
       the figure in Bristol being I think in the region of 13,000 or 14,000
       in 2014. In addition the  applicants  fail  to  identify  the  actual
       specific problem those businesses may  have  other  than  a  lack  of
       experience of setting  up  and  running  start  ups,  small  business
       ventures.


91.  As stated in the executive summary, "new  start  ups  are  often  faced
       with problems involving their lack of training, resource development,
       as well as essential knowledge to focus on  their  businesses."   The
       plan fails to identify how two people with very little or no business
       experience themselves and with no experience of a start up  disclosed
       to the decision maker would be able to find problems or solutions  to
       the problems that they claim exist, or  to  provide  details  of  the
       nature of such specific problems.


92.  The business plan fails comprehensively to analyse why  their  approach
       is better than existing alternatives other than to refer to the  fact
       that they are going to be cheaper.  Whilst I accept that cost  is  an
       important consideration for any business there is no analysis of  the
       services offered by any of the competitors and how  what  they  offer
       with their lack of experience is likely  to  make  it  an  attractive
       venture to their potential customer base.


93.  This is important  because  the  other  issue  the  business  plan  was
       required to identify or answer is the question: will it sell?   There
       should have been a clear idea of the  customers  the  businesses  are
       going to be targeting, who needs their  business,  the  services  the
       business is proposing to supply.  I  accept  there  is  reference  in
       terms to small start ups, new start ups,  but  again  in  generalised
       form with no detailed analysis.   A  clear  idea  of  who  they  are,
       particularly within the Bristol and Cardiff area, does not appear  to
       have been adequately researched.


94.  A clear idea of how they are going to sell their services and how  much
       the customers will pay for it is again only partly dealt with in  the
       business plan.  There is no assessment in the business  plan  of  the
       calculation of the basis on which  this  business  would  assess  its
       costs, i.e. work out what the appropriate rate  is  for  an  hour  of
       their time.  They make various statements that they will  be  cheaper
       than others because that is, and I understand the comment made,  more
       attractive to smaller businesses who may not have  a  great  deal  of
       money but they also  state  that  they  will  not  undercut  as  they
       consider  that  would  be  bad  for  their  business  reputation  and
       perception.  If they are going to be cheap but not  undercut  but  do
       not set out the basis on which they calculated  their  costs  how  on
       earth do they know how much they are going to  charge  the  customers
       for the work they undertake or at what level they need to  charge  to
       make a return?


95.  In relation to charging, when one looks at  the  contract  with  Flight
       Searches Limited it appears as if an  awful  lot  of  work  has  been
       agreed to be undertaken for a remuneration of �2,500.   There  is  no
       assessment in any of the documentation that that  is  a  genuine  and
       credible business decision and whilst I accept Dr Morgan's submission
       that many successful businessmen and women have gone through  periods
       of their lives where they have been bankrupt or their businesses have
       failed or things have not worked  out  as  they  anticipated,  it  is
       reasonable to  assume  that  those  businesspeople  such  as  Richard
       Branson and others who were referred to would have had a  clear  idea
       of how they were going to structure and run  their  business  in  the
       business plan that was produced to those whom  they  were  asking  to
       support it.  I accept that people like that in their infancy may have
       been looking for third party finance and  had  to  satisfy  a  person
       supplying finance of the credibility of the business,  which  is  the
       element missing at this stage in relation to this business,  but  the
       cash flow projection and the expenditure forecast  contained  in  the
       business plan clearly demonstrate that �47,000 of the �50,000 will be
       spent very quickly in administrative  and  set  up  costs  and  other
       capital expenditure.


96.  Bearing in mind that a grant of leave in  this  area  would  be  for  a
       period of three years, it is fair for the decision maker to  have  in
       mind whether the business plan shows that the matter has been thought
       through carefully to  ascertain  or  show  that  there  is  a  viable
       business that might last for at least that period of time.


97.  In relation to a clear plan for how the aims of the business are to  be
       achieved,  we  have  generalised   statements   regarding   leaflets,
       marketing and going to see customers who want their services but very
       little by way of detailed analysis,  which  one  would  anticipate  a
       genuine business would have.  A clear plan of how the  customers  are
       to be identified and reached is needed. Whilst  these  are  questions
       that were looked at to a certain extent in the business plan  and  in
       interview, the information in the business plan and in interview,  do
       not establish that credible  consideration  has  been  given  to  the
       marketing plan.  More importantly, there  is  no  assessment  of  the
       individual costings of the marketing plan, the cost-effectiveness  of
       the marketing plan and whether the business is  able  to  afford  the
       approach that is suggested.


98.  I mentioned during the course of the  submissions  to  Dr  Morgan  that
       when looking at the cash flow model at page 72  of  the  bundle,  one
       element of concern was that notwithstanding the statements  that  had
       been made that the way new contacts and customers were  going  to  be
       found was through marketing via the various  sources  that  had  been
       identified, there does not appear in the schedule of  expenditure  to
       be any provision in the budget for the costs of marketing.  The  cash
       flow expenditure projection covers the period year 1 (2014) to year 2
       (2015), yet what the parties have said in their application they  are
       going to do does not appear to be supported by any specific cash flow
       provision save  for  the  reference  in  the  financial  forecast  to
       conventional and  internet  social  media  of  �10,500,  specifically
       stated to be set up admin costs, not costs of the ongoing running  of
       this business.  This impacts upon the other thing that  the  decision
       maker would have needed to have considered, which  is  whether  there
       was a clear plan for how the services were going to be developed  and
       the market.


99.  It is also reasonable to expect that a business plan  will  answer  the
       question: how will the services that the  business  is  proposing  to
       offer pay?  An analysis of the costs of setting up  the  business  is
       required.  There is, as stated, a financial forecast  with  estimated
       capital expenditure and if that is  taken  as  satisfying  the  first
       element of this requirement it is arguable the  applicants  did  what
       was expected of them.


100. Following that, there is a requirement for an analysis of the  strength
       of the existing competition in  the  market.   In  this  respect  the
       business plan  and  the  replies  given  at  interview  are  woefully
       inadequate.  The question was asked  about  research  that  had  been
       undertaken and the answer that is  recorded  is  that  there  were  a
       couple of firms  providing  similar  services  in  their  area.   The
       Secretary of State says that there are 151 similar firms by reference
       to yell.com and there is no reason to doubt the  statement  that  has
       been made in that respect.


101. Of more concern, as  mentioned  to  Dr  Morgan  during  the  course  of
       submissions, is the  lack  of  any  appreciation  of  more  immediate
       competition within the Bristol area including  one  company  referred
       too who appeared to undertake  research  and  management  consultancy
       tasks, based in the same building  where  the  applicants  themselves
       hired the office space for a period of three months.


102. The business plan also fails to analyse what the applicants offer  over
       free  services  provisions  such  as  the  Department   of   Business
       Innovation Skills at gov.uk or  services  that  may  be  considerably
       cheaper as there is no need for the provider to make a  profit,  such
       as Brave Enterprise, an  independent  Bristol-based  not  for  profit
       organisation that offered advice, training and a consultancy  service
       to exactly the same  market  the  applicants  claim  they  intend  to
       establish themselves in in  the  Bristol  area.   Bristol  West  also
       represents  over  18,000  businesses  across  the  region   and   the
       Federation of Small Businesses run events in Bristol for members  and
       others who have a particular interest.


103. A general statement "there are a couple of  people  who  offer  similar
       services" is in itself clearly an indication of the lack of attention
       to detail in the documents provided to the decision maker in relation
       to a key aspect  of  the  business.  The  failure  to  undertake  the
       required analysis is relevant in relation to a second issue, which is
       the assertion in the business plan that there is a gap in the market.
        A claim that there is a gap in the market can only be a claim  based
       upon a belief that there  is  a  need  that  has  not  been  serviced
       elsewhere, where in fact the enquiry in relation to whether there  is
       a service that is required that is not being serviced  by  others  is
       woefully inadequate.


104. Tying in two points raised earlier, there is no analysis  of  the  cost
       of marketing  to  reach  the  prospective  customers,  a  failure  to
       properly identify who they are, and the true competition the business
       is facing.  There is no analysis whether the costs  and  expenses  of
       setting up the business and attempting  to  secure  a  viable  market
       share will impact upon the viability of the business in light of  the
       time and cost, competition, changes, required effort,  employees  who
       have been identified that are required.  Identification of objectives
       of  the  directors  was  a  matter  commented  upon  based  upon  the
       interviews, targets and priorities and timetables  are  mentioned  in
       terms of what the business wants to attain but not in a  manner  that
       one would anticipate in a proper business plan.


105. I accept that the business plan does assess in terms of need  what  the
       directors believe are the human resource issues and the strengths and
       weaknesses are identified in the SWOT analysis as would  be  required
       and as the applicants would be aware as a result  of  their  academic
       qualifications.  When Dr Morgan was asked during the  course  of  his
       submissions: "having identified the weaknesses, where is the analysis
       of how the company is going to deal with them?" he had to accept that
       does not appear in a proper form in the business plan.


106.  The  decision  maker  as  part  of  the  process  of  assessing   this
       application had a document and replies at  interview  that  contained
       the name of the business, contained information as to the stage  that
       had been reached vis-�-vis incorporation, ownership of  the  �50,000,
       availability of �50,000 and one contract.  The product  the  business
       was selling, namely  the  consultancy  services,  was  identified  in
       general terms.   The  money  and  resources  required  to  start  the
       business it is arguable were identified  taking  up  �47,000  of  the
       �50,000.  What was hoped to be  achieved  is  identified  in  general
       terms.


107.  Names,  qualifications  and  abilities  of  the  directors  and  their
       academic  qualifications  were  proved.   Practical  experience   was
       claimed but not proved.  Statements on  how  the  business  would  be
       managed were vague.  Descriptions of the jobs involved in running the
       business and skills required were not adequately  assessed.   Whether
       people would need training was not identified although if two  people
       came in it would be necessary to consider training needs.   The  cost
       of that was not identified.  Details of what the  business  plans  to
       offer the market are not sufficiently detailed.   What  research  has
       been  done  is  inappropriate  and  ineffective.   Plans  to  develop
       products and services - generalised statements only, how the  planned
       product or service fits the market  -  generalised  statements  only,
       marketing - not properly identified,  trends  in  the  market  -  not
       identified, the share of the market that the business will need to be
       profitable and viable  -  not  considered,  main  competitors  -  not
       adequately analysed, the way the price they are going to charge  fits
       in the market - not analysed at all because there  is  no  indication
       that the price or the costs of the service have  been  identified  in
       any way in the business plan or the information before  the  decision
       maker.


108. Premises  are  referred  to,  the  short  lease  taken  on  the  office
       premises, but there is also a comment in the business plan that there
       will be further costs as they intend to move, meaning that having set
       out the virtues of the location of the office they took the lease on,
       it appears it is now planned that the  business  is  to  move  to  an
       unidentified location.


109. The concerns in relation to the financial issues in the  business  plan
       are important because cash flow is the life blood of any business and
       without cash flow and the ability to make a profit the business  will
       fail.  There is a projected cash flow for the year 2014 which in some
       respects contradicts a statement made earlier in  the  business  plan
       where it was acknowledged that a new business setting  itself  up  is
       unlikely to make a return for some time as  that  new  business  will
       need to establish itself, build up its base and get sufficient income
       coming in that then exceeded the amount of the business  expenditure.
       The cash flow forecast  for  2014,  however,  has  this  business  in
       profit, making a surplus in month 5 based upon cash sales  increasing
       by substantial increments on a monthly basis.  When one looks at  the
       business plan there is no support on any basis to show  that  such  a
       cash sale forecast is feasible or realistic.


110. A contract for services for a year at �2,500 makes little  contribution
       towards a projected income assessed as varying from 1,000 a month  in
       month 1 to just over �12,000 in month 12 of year 2.  There  are  also
       concerns within this cash flow forecast,  for  example,  I  mentioned
       earlier there is no specific reference to  a  marketing  budget,  the
       fact that at the time it is anticipated the business would be  taking
       off and trading well there is reference to a reduction in the  costs,
       for example of postage and telephone at a time one  would  anticipate
       such costs to increase in relation  to  year  2  when  activities  of
       developing and maintaining contacts with clients would be greater.


111. There is an element for wages equating to �30,804 per annum or  �15,400
       per employee for the two employees.  It has not been shown that  that
       is a realistic calculation or expectation in relation to the  quality
       of staff the business may require taking into account  in  particular
       the changes that have been made to the requirement of  businesses  to
       provide pensions and employee-related costs  when  an  individual  is
       hired or fired and the increase that is on the horizon  now  for  the
       introduction of the living wage.  I do appreciate that when this cash
       flow forecast was drawn such issues were not known, in fact  many  of
       them were not known until the  most  recent  budget  by  the  current
       government,  but  it  shows  the  need  for  an  accurate  cash  flow
       management forecast.


112. There is no realistic indication of how profitable this  business  will
       be, how big any mark-up be over the costs of providing  the  services
       or how  much  money  will  be  required  to  run  the  business.   Of
       particular concern, if �47,000 of the �50,000  is  spent  on  capital
       expenditure including set up costs, property, furniture, rent,  rate,
       website design and purchasing a telephone system,  this  means  those
       funds will have been exhausted very quickly.  There is  no  plausible
       analysis or examination of how this business will be able to  survive
       with its stated fixed costs appearing in the cash flow projection and
       the claim that they need  at  least  �4,300  per  month  to  survive,
       without the directors taking any income themselves from the business.


113. The answers given at interview reinforced the concerns that arise  from
       the business plan provided to the Secretary of State in  relation  to
       the application.  The requirement of the decision maker was to  apply
       properly the relevant Rules that I referred to earlier.  One  of  the
       issues the decision maker was required to  take  into  account,  when
       assessing whether this was a proper application that deserved a grant
       of leave or a credible or viable  application,  was  the  information
       provided in the business plan or in the interview.


114. This is not a decision that it has been shown was made by a  series  of
       hurdles being set before  the  applicants  that  the  decision  maker
       expected them to jump  over  and,  if  they  could  not,  then  their
       application would be refused.  Most of the information  that  led  to
       the impugned decision, ignoring the point that the Secretary of State
       accepts was wrong, is information that was provided by the applicants
       themselves.


115. I do not find it has been made out that the decision  maker  failed  to
       properly apply the relevant Immigration Rules.  I do not find it  has
       been made out as asserted in ground 3 that the decision maker made an
       error of law in the  refusals  by  failing  to  assess  properly  the
       evidence adduced in the separate interviews.  The procedure that  was
       adopted clearly shows that at the point the decision  was  made,  the
       balance of probability stage, that information would have been  taken
       into account. The replies given, especially  when  referring  to  the
       answers to questions 12 and 13 of the interview of Mr  Sher,  support
       the concerns set out in  the  impugned  decision.   For  example,  at
       question 13 when asked about how many other businesses exist  in  the
       local area offering the  same  services  and  how  he  would  attract
       customers to his business it states "there are  a  couple  of  firms,
       companies which provide the same service  which  we  are  providing",
       which is clearly incorrect and demonstrates the lack of investigation
       or proper enquiry that was undertaken.


116. I accept, as submitted by Dr Morgan, that there were  factors  such  as
       the existence of the money,  the  fact  that  the  company  had  been
       incorporated, the fact that there were directors, the fact that  some
       documents had been produced, that may have supported an argument this
       was a genuine business intention but the Rules make it clear that far
       more than that is required.  They are parts of the overall assessment
       and it has not been made  out  that  the  decision  maker  failed  to
       undertake the  examination  required  with  the  required  degree  of
       anxious scrutiny and in particular it is clear that adequate  reasons
       have been given for refusing the application for leave based upon the
       nature of  the  information  the  decision  maker  had  available  to
       consider.


117. Ground 4 related to the issue regarding Mohammed  Rehan,  the  director
       of Flight Searches Limited.  I have commented upon  this  during  the
       judgment.  It is accepted  that  the  Secretary  of  State  got  this
       element wrong in the impugned decision.  I do  not  accept  when  the
       weight of evidence  is  considered  as  a  whole  that  it  has  been
       established that the decision maker's mind was unduly  influenced  by
       that error or any suggestion that would arise  therefrom  that  there
       was any suggestion of fraud, particularly as I have found above there
       is no indication that this was a material aspect of the  decision  to
       refuse the applications.


118. In summary therefore, it is my finding that it has not been shown  that
       the process followed by the Secretary of State or the decision  maker
       in arriving at the  impugned  decision  is  in  any  way  capable  of
       successful  challenge  on  public  law  grounds.   It  followed   the
       procedure set out in public domain and referred to in  the  statement
       by Paul Martin provided by the Secretary of State.


119. It has not been shown that  notwithstanding  concerns  expressed  as  a
       result of the history and chronology of this matter that the decision
       maker  failed  to  consider  these  matters  with  an  open  mind  in
       accordance with the obligations imposed upon him or her.  It has  not
       been made out  that  the  decision  to  refuse  the  applications  by
       reference to the non-points scoring elements of the Immigration Rules
       is in any way irrational or unlawful or unfair on the  basis  of  the
       material available to the decision maker.  It has not been  made  out
       on any basis, considering the information and evidence  and  material
       provided by the decision maker, that having properly  undertaken  the
       requirement to examine that evidence  set  out  in  245DD,  that  the
       conclusion that was reached is unfair or  susceptible  to  successful
       challenge on Wednesbury grounds and for that  reason  I  dismiss  the
       judicial review claim.
