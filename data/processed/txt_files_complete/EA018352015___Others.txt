                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. This is a Sala case.  The Tribunal's refusal of  permission  to  appeal
    was set aside by the High Court.

 2. Having consulted the parties, I now grant  permission,  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law, and  direct  that
    the appeal be determined by the First-tier Tribunal.


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
