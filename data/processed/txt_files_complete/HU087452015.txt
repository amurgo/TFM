Representation:
For the Secretary of State:     Mr C. Bates, Home Office Presenting
Officer, instructed by
For the respondent:        Mr T. Lawrence, Southwark Law Centre

                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

    1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination  of  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Majid.  However, for the sake of  continuity,  I
       shall refer to Mr Aw as the appellant as he was  before  the  First-
       tier Tribunal.


    2. This is one of 4 cases in  my  list  today  all  of  which  concerns
       determinations   made   by   First-tier   Tribunal    Judge    Majid
       (HU/08143/2015;    HU/08745/2015;    HU/09167/2015;    IA/45841    &
       48501/2014).


    3. In each of the cases the appeal was determined  in  the  appellant's
       favour to the effect that the Judge was persuaded that the appellant
       came within the relevant Immigration Rules sometimes by reference to
       having the  benefit  of  a  discretion  (which  the  Judge  did  not
       possess).

    4. All the determinations are strikingly  similar.   The  bulk  of  the
       determination contains general comments, touching upon the  law  but
       in terms that no specific legal thread is identified that bears upon
       the appellant's case.  Some of it is anecdotal  [paragraph  23]  and
       some at  such  a  basic  level  as  not  to  have  required  mention
       [paragraphs 18 and 21 (a)].  There is a fair degree of the  homespun
       about it.   Almost  all  can  fairly  be  described  as  irrelevant,
       [paragraph 18].  Some is unintelligible [paragraph  21(b)].     Some
       is simply wrong [paragraphs 17].  The effect is that I  cannot  with
       confidence rely upon the process of decision making as a whole.

    5. Credibility appears to have been only partially disposed of (counter-
       intuitively, perhaps) in paragraph 15 by conceding  the  answers  in
       interview were 'outrageously incorrect' and misleading but  fairness
       demanded he was given 'human care and judicial compassion.'

    6. The determination does not reveal the nature of the application  nor
       the respondent's  approach  to  it.   The  legal  framework  is  not
       referred to.  We would not know that this was a claim  made  by  the
       applicant for further leave to remain  on  the  basis  that  removal
       would violate his protected private life; that it  was  governed  by
       Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE(1) and that the  applicant  had  to
       demonstrate very significant obstacles to the claimant's integration
       into Senegal where he had spent his formative years.

    7. Regrettably,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  write  a
       determination that properly dealt with the legal and factual  issues
       he was tasked to resolve.  I set aside the decision  and  remit  the
       matter to the First-tier Tribunal for it to be remade.

DECISION

The Judge made an error on a point of law and I set the determination
aside.  I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to enable the
decision to be re-made.

                                                            16 November 2017
