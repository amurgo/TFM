For the Respondent:    Mr S Khalid, instructed by Lords Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 27 April 2015, the Secretary of  State  was  granted  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the decision and reasons statement
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Roopnarine-Davies that was promulgated  on
    3 March 2015.

 2. Judge Roopnarine-Davies allowed  the  appeal  against  the  immigration
    decision of 10 October 2014 on the basis Mr Sabir had shown that it was
    more likely than not  that  he  genuinely  intended  and  was  able  to
    establish one or  more  businesses  within  six  months  and  genuinely
    intended to invest a sum of �50,000.  In so  doing,  Judge  Roopnarine-
    Davies found Mr Sabir to have met in full the requirements of paragraph
    245DD(h) and (i) of the immigration rules which were the  only  matters
    in issue.

 3. The Secretary of State did not seek to  challenge  these  findings  but
    argues that Judge Roopnarine-Davies was mistaken for thinking that  the
    issues in the appeal related only to paragraph 245(DD)(h) and (i).   It
    was clear from the reasons for refusal that the Secretary of State  had
    also concluded that Mr  Sabir  had  failed  to  provide  evidence  that
    complied with the specified documentation requirements of paragraph 41-
    SD(e)(iv) of appendix A to the immigration rules in relation to stating
    the duration of the contracts.  Judge Roopnarine-Davies did not  engage
    with this issue whatsoever and therefore the decision was unsound.

 4. Mr Khalid conceded that Judge Roopnarine-Davies did not deal with  this
    issue and that amounted to an error on a  point  of  law.   I  have  no
    reason to go behind his concession because it is clear from the reasons
    for refusal letter of 10 October  2014  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    alleged Mr Sabir failed  to  meet  the  requirement  of  paragraph  41-
    SD(e)(iv) and that  is  not  addressed  in  the  decision  and  reasons
    statement.  It is necessary, in such circumstances, to set the decision
    aside to consider this issue.

 5. The parties agree that Mr Sabir submitted two service  agreements  with
    his application as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  on  29  July  2014.
    These are the contracts on which he relies and which the  Secretary  of
    State says do not state duration.  The contracts are in similar format.
     They include the following.

         Term of Agreement

         The terms of this Agreement (the "Term") will begin on the date  of
         this Agreement and will remain in full force and effect  until  the
         completion of  the  Services  subject  to  earlier  termination  as
         provided in this Agreement.  The Term  of  this  Agreement  may  be
         extended by mutual written agreement of the Parties.

         In the even that either Party wishes to terminate  this  Agreement,
         that Party will be required to provide thirty (30) days' notice  to
         the other Party.

         Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the obligations  of
         the Service Provider will terminate upon the earlier of the Service
         Provider ceasing to be engaged by the Customer or  the  termination
         of this Agreement by the Customer or the Service Provider.

         ...

         Compensation

         For the services rendered by the Service Provider  as  required  by
         this  Agreement,  the  Customer  will  provide  compensation   (the
         "Compensation") �[amount stated as relevant for each contract]  per
         month to the Service Provider as follows.

         ...

         [Thereafter is a schedule of 12 payments]

 6. Looking at the contracts as a whole, it is  evident  to  me  that  each
    contract is for a 12 month period although either could  be  terminated
    early or extended.  The contracts also indicate the  commencement  date
    as being the same as the date signed.

 7. Ms Savage was unable to point  to  any  legal  requirement  that  might
    indicate that the  contents  of  Mr  Sabir's  contracts  would  not  be
    regarded as specifying duration.  I  have  considered  the  wording  of
    paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) and am aware that the immigration rules  do  not
    prescribe that the contract must state start and end dates or be for  a
    minimum period.  Neither do the rules prescribe that the contract is in
    any particular form (a point considered by the Upper Tribunal in  Shebl
    (Entrepreneur: proof of contract) [2014] UKUT 00216 (IAC)).  I conclude
    that the Secretary of State was wrong to conclude  that  the  contracts
    did not specify duration.

 8. However, even if I am wrong in this conclusion, I  accept  Mr  Khalid's
    alternative submission.  The provision relied upon by the Secretary  of
    State can be found in paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(1)(d) of appendix A to the
    immigration rules.  That is not  the  full  content  of  paragraph  41-
    SD(e)(iv).  The alternative provision of paragraph 41-SD(e)(2)  is  for
    an applicant to provide:

         "one  or  more  original  letters   from   UK-regulated   financial
         institutions with which the applicant has a business  bank  account
         on  the  institution's  headed  paper,  confirming  the  dates  the
         business was trading during the period referred to at (iv) above [a
         continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014 up to  no  earlier
         than three months before the date of his application]."

 9. With his application, Mr Sabir submitted a letter  from  Barclays  Bank
    plc dated 2 July 2014 in which the  bank  confirmed  he  had  opened  a
    business  bank  account.   Mr  Sabir  also  submitted   itemised   bank
    statements up to the date of application confirming  the  business  was
    trading, which could be seen by the  credits  made  in  line  with  the
    contracts.  Mr Khalid said that these documents met the requirements of
    paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(2).

10. Ms Savage had little to argue other  than  the  notion  that  the  bank
    statements were not letters and that the evidence  merely  showed  when
    the business account was opened.  Ms Savage did accept  that  the  bank
    documents were submitted with the application.  They  are  specifically
    listed in the application form even though they were  not  included  in
    the Secretary of State's bundle.

11. It is not difficult to envisage what  the  immigration  rules  require.
    The purpose of the requirements is to enable the Secretary of State  to
    verify that the business is operating.   If  a  business  is  receiving
    income it is trading.  Bank documents will confirm whether  a  business
    is  receiving  income.   To  that  extent,  Mr  Sabir's   evidence   is
    compelling.  This is why I would find in favour of Mr  Khalid's  second
    argument even  if  my  conclusion  regarding  the  first  were  somehow
    mistaken.

12. For all these reasons, although I find that there was  an  error  on  a
    point of law in Judge Roopnarine's decision and reasons  statement  and
    that error is such that I must remake the  decision,  on  remaking  the
    decision I find that Mr Sabir met and meets all the requirements of the
    immigration rules and his  appeal  against  the  immigration  decisions
    should be allowed.

13. I add for completeness that as I  find  Mr  Sabir  succeeds  under  the
    substantive immigration rules, the decision to remove  him  by  way  of
    directions cannot be in accordance with the law and his appeal  against
    that secondary decision also succeeds.

Decision

The decision and reasons statement of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Roopnarine-
Davies contains an error on a point of law and is set aside.

I remake the decision and allow Mr Sabir's appeal  against  the  immigration
decisions of 10 October 2014.
