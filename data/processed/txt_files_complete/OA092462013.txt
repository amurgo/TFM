Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Saleem of RKS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeet, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant appealed to a Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  against
    the respondent's decision of 12 March 2013 refusing to grant her  entry
    clearance as the spouse of her husband, the sponsor.  The  refusal  was
    under ECP.1.1.(d) and the relevant criteria for that is set out in  the
    respondent's decision refusing entry clearance.  This requires that  in
    respect of salaried employment  in  the  United  Kingdom,  all  of  the
    following evidence must be provided:-

    .    The P60 for the relevant period or periods.


    .    Wage slips covering either a period of six  months  prior  to  the
         date of application if the applicant has  been  employed  by  their
         current employer for at least six months, or  a  period  of  twelve
         months prior to the date of application if the applicant  has  been
         employed by their current employer for less than six months.


    .    A letter from the employer confirming the person's employment  and
         gross annual salary.


    .    The length of their employment.


    .    The period over which they have been or were  paid  the  level  of
         salary relied upon in the application.


    .    The type of employment - permanent, fixed contract or agency.


    .    Assigned contract of employment.


    .    Monthly personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period
         as the wage slips showing that the salary has  been  paid  into  an
         account in the name of the person or in the name of the person  and
         their partner jointly.


2.   The sponsor sought to satisfy the financial requirements  of  the  Rule
    which is the essential issue the judge had to deal with on the basis of
    three sources of income.  First, employment with Asda;  second,  rental
    income from a property owned, and thirdly, employment from a second job
    he had as a window cleaner.  The  judge  accepted  the  combination  of
    income from the first two sources which came to slightly under �15,000,
    so bearing in mind the �18,600 threshold he had  to  show  the  further
    employment as a window cleaner in order to satisfy this requirement  of
    the Rules.  The decision maker said in relation to this that:-

     "I am satisfied your sponsor is in employment with Asda, but I  am  not
         satisfied that he is employed with Gleam Window  Cleaning  Services
         Ltd.  The wage slips you have submitted are those that  are  easily
         produced, therefore have little evidential value, the amount earned
         is not  reflected  in  your  sponsor's  bank  statement  and  I  am
         satisfied that the evidence for the second employment was  produced
         to strengthen your application".

3.   When the judge came to consider this  employment  she  noted  that  the
    sponsor was claiming he had additional earnings working in a second job
    as  a  window  cleaner  and  he  had  provided  wage  slips  from  this
    employment, but she said the only other corroboration is a letter  from
    his employer and his oral evidence.  This was not sufficient to satisfy
    the requirements of Appendix FM in terms  of  the  specified  evidence.
    There was no money credited in the bank statements  which  matched  his
    stated cash payments and  he  did  not  provide  evidence  of  savings,
    although his statements showed he was living within his means, and  the
    argument really comes down to whether the judge was entitled  to  reach
    this conclusion.  Mr Saleem has mentioned  the  fact  that  a  P60  was
    handed in at the hearing and there is mention of that in the grounds of
    appeal.  The judge has not referred to it, I have not been able to find
    it on the file  and  it  seems  there  were  no  copies  kept,  so  its
    whereabouts remains something of a mystery, but I think that is  not  a
    matter that need be a point of concern because it was not a point taken
    against the appellant for whatever reason when  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance was made.  It really was made only on this relatively  narrow
    point of the amount claimed to be earned from the window cleaning,  but
    not being reflected in the  bank  statements.   Copies  of  those  bank
    statements were provided and Mr Saleem makes the  point  that  the  pay
    method can be seen to be in cash and it will  be  harsh  to  hold  that
    against the appellant if he could not provide in his bank account clear
    evidence of the amounts of �89.60 per week that were  said  to  be  the
    payment for this employment being reflected in the bank account.

4.   The difficulty with that submission is that as the requirements of  the
    Rules make clear, all following evidence must be provided and there  is
    the specific requirement of monthly personal  bank  statements  showing
    that the salary has been paid into an account in the name of the person
    or the person and their partner jointly, and the bank statements do not
    do that.  I recognise that that may well be a difficulty  for  somebody
    in the sponsor's position who is paid in cash and may not at  the  time
    be aware of the requirements of the Rules to have effectively  to  show
    that the monies paid into the bank account and then to take money  out.
    One can understand why somebody might be at least as likely  simply  to
    spend the cash as it came in rather than realising that it  had  to  be
    paid into an account in order to prove that payment and  then  take  it
    out, but that is the requirement of the Rules.   Unfortunately,  though
    it is for the appellant and the sponsor, it  is  not  fatal  because  a
    further application could be made and in future if this  is  a  genuine
    occupation, then the earnings can be paid into a bank account in  order
    to prove that the payments have been made and the requirements for  the
    Rules are met, but because that was a specific ground  of  refusal  and
    because it was a specific matter addressed by  the  judge,  I  consider
    that it was perfectly open to  her  and  proper  for  her,  and  indeed
    required for her to take that into account in dismissing the appeal  as
    she did.

5.   Mr Saleem has not raised any points about proportionality  and  Article
    8 in submissions today.  It was, I think, a matter that  was  mentioned
    in the grounds, but again I do not think the judge  arguably  erred  in
    that respect.  She seems to have given consideration  to  the  relevant
    issues and came to conclusions  that  were  open  to  her,  so  in  all
    respects I maintain her decision dismissing the appeal.


Signed                                  Date
