    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Miss M Kumar of
           counsel instructed by Legend solicitors
          For the Respondent: Ms A Holmes a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was  born  on  23  February
      1989. He has been given permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of
      First-Tier Tribunal Judge  McGavin  ("the  FTTJ")  who  dismissed  his
      appeal against the respondent's  decision  of  16  September  2013  to
      refuse him leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
      Migrant under the Points-based System and for  a  Biometric  Residence
      Permit.


   2. The appellant was granted leave to enter the UK as a  Tier  4  student
      under the Points-based System for a period from 31 January 2011  until
      26 February 2013. On 22 February 2013 he applied for further leave  in
      the same capacity in order to attend Park  Royal  College  in  London.
      However, the sponsor's licence for that College had been suspended and
      the respondent notified the appellant of this by  a  letter  dated  16
      June 2013. As a result he  no  longer  had  a  valid  Confirmation  of
      Acceptance for Studies (CAS). In that letter the  respondent  informed
      him that consideration of his application would be  suspended  for  60
      days to give him the opportunity to take one of a number  of  possible
      courses of action; one possibility being to obtain a new  sponsor  and
      another CAS.


   3. The appellant obtained  a  place  at  the  London  Empire  Academy  in
      Chiswick and from them a CAS dated 5 August 2013. This  was  submitted
      to the respondent and he was awarded the required  points  under  this
      category. However, the respondent refused the application on the basis
      that the appellant had not shown that he was entitled  to  the  points
      for Maintenance (Funds). He had not produced the required documents to
      show that he was in possession of  �7200  for  a  consecutive  28  day
      period. Indeed, he had produced no evidence of any funds available  to
      him.


   4. The appellant appealed to the  First-Tier  Tribunal  asking  that  his
      appeal be determined on the papers which is what the FTTJ  did  on  29
      January 2013. In advance of the hearing the  appellant  submitted  two
      bundles of documents.


   5. The FTTJ found that the appellant had provided  no  evidence  to  show
      that he submitted maintenance documents to the respondent,  what  they
      were or when they were submitted. The  two  documents  in  the  appeal
      bundle both dated 22 July 2013 from the Lahore branch of Bank  Alfalah
      Ltd could not have been submitted with the application of 22  February
      2013. The respondent's flexibility policy did not assist the appellant
      where the appellant claimed to have supplied the necessary documentary
      evidence of maintenance funds but had in fact supplied no evidence  at
      all. The FTTJ dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and  on
      human rights grounds. In the light of the amendments contained in  s51
      of the Crime and Courts Act 2013  the  FTTJ  upheld  the  s47  removal
      decision.


   6. The appellant applied for and was granted permission to appeal to  the
      Upper Tribunal by a judge in  the  First-Tier  Tribunal.  The  grounds
      submit that the FTTJ made an error of fact amounting to  an  error  of
      law. Following the respondent's letter of 16 June 2013  the  appellant
      alleged that he had not only submitted a new  CAS  from  a  recognised
      College but had also submitted the  bank  letter  and  bank  statement
      dated 22 July 2013 which, although they would have been too  late  for
      the original application submitted on 22 February 2013,  were  of  the
      right date and covered the  appropriate  period  for  the  resubmitted
      application.


   7. I have a Rule 24 response from the respondent.  Unfortunately,  either
      or both of the appellant's  and/or  the  respondent's  representatives
      lacked some of the documents on the  Tribunal  file.  I  arranged  for
      copies to be provided. I was given copies of some documents  from  the
      respondent's file. Miss Kumar did not object.


   8. Ms Holmes conceded that the FTTJ made an error of fact amounting to an
      error of law, as alleged in the grounds of appeal, and I so find.  The
      FTTJ should have considered the bank letter and bank  statement  dated
      22 July 2013 in the light of the renewed application made as a  result
      of what was said in the respondent's letter of 16 June  2013,  whether
      they had  in  fact  been  submitted  and  if  so  the  effect  on  the
      appellant's application. I conclude that  as  a  result  the  decision
      should be set aside and remade. Ms Holmes also conceded on  behalf  of
      the respondent that if the originals of the  letter  from  the  Lahore
      branch of Bank Alfalah Ltd dated 22 July  2013  and  the  accompanying
      bank statement covering the period from 18 December 2012  to  15  July
      2013 ("the bank letter and  statement")  had  been  submitted  to  the
      respondent when the appellant claimed he would have  established  that
      he met the Maintenance (Funds) requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
      and have been entitled to the required points. I note, although  I  do
      not need to go behind the concession made by Ms Holmes,  that  at  the
      current rate of  conversion  of  162  Pakistan  rupees  to  the  pound
      sterling the amount that the appellant was required  to  show  (�7200)
      equates to 1,166,400 Pakistan rupees and that the balance on the  bank
      statement was at all times well in excess of this figure.


   9. I indicated that I was  minded  to  remake  the  decision  without  an
      adjournment. There was no objection from either representative.


  10. In the circumstances this appeal turns on  the  disputed  question  of
      whether the appellant submitted the original bank letter and statement
      to the respondent. He claimed to have done so by posting  them  on  13
      August 2013 together with the new CAS. The appellant  claims  that  he
      posted these documents in person and obtained  the  receipt  from  the
      Post Office which appears in his bundle. The respondent  accepts  that
      the CAS was sent and received  but  says  that  the  bank  letter  and
      statement were not. The respondent relies on a case record sheet dated
      16 September 2013.


  11. Miss Kumar called the appellant to give evidence.  I  asked  him  some
      questions and he was cross examined. His evidence is  set  out  in  my
      record of proceedings.


  12. I heard submissions from both  representatives.  Ms  Holmes  submitted
      that if the appellant had posted the documents as he claimed he  would
      have known where the Post Office was. She invited me to find  that  he
      had not provided satisfactory evidence to establish that he had posted
      them.


  13. Miss Kumar submitted that the appellant had established  that  he  had
      posted the documents. It was  difficult  to  understand  why,  if  the
      respondent had not received the original bank letter and statement the
      letter dated 17 September  2013  inviting  him  to  go  and  have  his
      biometrics taken would have been issued. In response to my  invitation
      Miss Kumar said that she did not  wish  to  make  any  submissions  in
      relation to the respondent's case record sheet.


  14. I reserved my determination.


  15. I find that the appellant did supply a letter and bank statement  from
      the Lahore branch of Bank Alfalah Ltd both dated 20 February 2013 with
      his original application dated 22 February 2013. During the course  of
      the hearing Ms Holmes found the originals on the respondent's file and
      produced them.


  16.  The respondent accepts and I find that the CAS dated  5  August  2013
      from London Empire Academy was sent to and received by the respondent.
      The appellant alleges that he posted both this CAS  and  the  original
      bank letter and statement to the respondent in an envelope  without  a
      covering letter on 13 August 2013. He has produced a copy receipt from
      the Post Office as evidence of this.


  17. The Post Office receipt was issued at 199-205 Haverstock  Hill  London
      NW3 4QG on 13 August 2013 at 22.28 and fee  of  �6.95  was  paid.  The
      destination address is recorded as  PO  Box  3468  S38WA.  I  have  no
      evidence as to whether there is such an address or if so whether it is
      a correct address for the respondent. In his  evidence  the  appellant
      said that he posted the application submitted in  February  2013  with
      the letter and bank statement from the Lahore branch of  Bank  Alfalah
      Ltd dated 20 February 2013. This was his bank. He posted the originals
      of the later bank statement  and  letter  with  the  CAS  form  in  an
      envelope without a covering letter to the  Home  Office  from  a  Post
      Office in East Ham not far from where  he  lived.  He  was  shown  the
      receipt issued by the Post Office and said that this was  the  receipt
      given to him at the post office in East Ham. In cross examination  the
      appellant repeated that he had posted  these  documents  from  a  Post
      Office in East Ham. When it was pointed out to him  that  the  receipt
      was issued by a Post Office in Haverstock Hill he changed his mind and
      said that the first application had been sent from a  Post  Office  in
      East Ham and the later submission, in August 2013, had been sent  from
      Haverstock Hill. He had gone into the Post Office, not  just  put  the
      envelope in the post box outside. When asked the amount of the fee  he
      looked at the receipt and said �6.35.


  18. From the respondent I have the case record sheet which states that the
      appellant "has not sent  in  bank  statements".  Looking  at  all  the
      evidence in the round I find that the appellant is not credible. I  do
      not believe that that he sent the bank letter  and  statement  to  the
      respondent on 13 August 2013 or at all. His oral evidence was evasive.
      On three occasions he stated that the envelope had been posted from  a
      Post Office in East Ham. When the inconsistency between this  evidence
      and the address of the Post Office stated on the receipt  was  pointed
      out to him he changed his evidence to accommodate the inconsistency. I
      accept that the new CAS was sent to and received by the respondent but
      not but it was posted when  the  appellant  claimed  or  that  it  was
      accompanied by the bank letter and statement. I do not  consider  that
      the letter dated 17 September 2013 inviting the appellant to go  to  a
      participating place to have his biometrics (scanned  fingerprints  and
      photographs) taken provides any indication  that  the  respondent  did
      receive the bank letter and statement. There is nothing in this letter
      to indicate otherwise or that the respondent was minded to  grant  the
      appellant's application.


  19. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and  can  see  no
      good reason to do so.


  20. I find that the appellant has failed to establish that on his  renewed
      application he supplied the required evidence of  Maintenance  (Funds)
      or indeed any evidence.  He  has  not  met  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration  Rules.  The  appellant  has  not  contested  the   FTTJ's
      decisions to dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds or  to  uphold
      the s47 removal decision, which stand.  Having  found  that  the  FTTJ
      erred in law and set aside her  decision  I  remake  the  decision  by
      dismissing the appellant's appeal.
