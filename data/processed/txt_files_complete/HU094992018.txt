Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Georget (counsel for Biruntha Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is the appeal of Pirathap Thilagendran, a citizen of  Sri  Lanka
       born 27  February  1993,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal of 17 October 2018 dismissing  his  appeal,  itself  brought
       against the Respondent's refusal of his human rights claim of 5 April
       2018.


    2. The Appellant arrived in the UK on 27 October 2007.  He  was  granted
       DLR as a minor, until 27 August 2010. On 14 August  2010  he  applied
       for further leave. The Respondent had recorded that that  application
       was refused on 6 December 2010, though the Appellant disputed  having
       received lawful notice of that decision. He applied on 15 August 2017
       for  leave  to  remain  on  private  and  family  life  grounds.  The
       Respondent refused that application because he did  not  accept  that
       the Appellant would face very significant obstacles to integration or
       unjustifiably harsh consequences to relocation to Sri Lanka,  bearing
       in mind he was a young man in good health with significant experience
       of life in Sri Lanka.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal set out the evidence it  had  considered.  It
       accepted the Appellant's account of not having been served  with  the
       December 2010 refusal of his application, given the  cogent  evidence
       (from the Respondent's own computer check, from a  foster  carer  and
       from a social services Pathway Plan), to such effect. Accordingly his
       application of August 2010 had never been determined, and as  it  had
       been made in timely fashion, section 3C of the Immigration  Act  1971
       operated such as to confer him with leave thereafter, so giving him a
       basis to vary that  application  via  his  August  2017  application,
       meaning that he had been present with leave until the  conclusion  of
       any appeal against the latter application's refusal.

    4.  By  now  the  Appellant  had  begun   a   relationship   with   Miss
       Sriskandarajah, which had endured for 5 months at  the  date  of  the
       hearing. The Tribunal  accepted  this  was  a  genuine  relationship,
       though did not consider it could be described as "strong"  given  its
       relative brevity.

    5. The Tribunal noted that the Appellant had not satisfied the "life  in
       the UK" requirements found in Appendix KOLL, though accepted that  as
       his English was excellent there was little doubt  that  he  would  be
       able to pass that aspect of the test. He had resided in the UK for  a
       significant period, including three years as a child, though given he
       had lived the rest of his childhood in Sri Lanka, that was a  neutral
       factor.  His assertion that he did not speak Tamil was not  credible,
       given that his solicitors had  requested  a  Tamil  interpreter,  the
       skeleton argument had referred to him  speaking  Tamil,  and  he  had
       referred to Tamil being his first  language  at  the  outset  of  the
       hearing.

    6. Although his application  had  been  outstanding  for  a  significant
       period, which needed to be considered having regard to the principles
       established in EB (Kosovo), the Appellant had acquiesced in the delay
       in some degree, by not having sought to progress it between 2012  and
       2017, albeit that he had raised the matter  with  the  Respondent  in
       2011 and 2012; he had been present in the UK lawfully throughout  the
       application's  consideration,  and  whilst  he  had   suffered   some
       disadvantage and detriment as he had been unable to  finish  college,
       this all carried less weight than otherwise, albeit  that  the  delay
       was excessive  and  unreasonable  and  amounted  to  a  compassionate
       circumstance.  The further 8  month  period  taken  to  consider  his
       varied was not in itself excessive.

    7. Overall the First-tier Tribunal concluded that the Appellant had  not
       established that the  adverse  consequences  of  the  delay  were  so
       weighty to mean his application should have been  allowed  given  his
       limited UK connections, bearing in  mind  his  personal  history  and
       domestic circumstances. He thus did not satisfy the  requirements  of
       Rule 276B. Nor did he meet the requirements  of  Rule  276ADE  as  he
       could not show very  significant  obstacles  to  integration  in  Sri
       Lanka, given he spoke the language, had lived there for a significant
       period, understood the culture, had family support  available,  could
       work, and was in good health.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal could see no space for Article 8  to  operate
       outside the Rules, there  being  no  discernible  "gap"  between  the
       issues covered by the Rules and otherwise.

    9. However, in any event, it was not accepted he had established  family
       life in the UK with his aunt, uncle and cousins, and his family  life
       with his partner was limited given their relationship  was  of  short
       duration and they did not cohabit, and had been developed whilst  his
       leave was precarious. There were no insurmountable obstacles  to  its
       pursuit abroad if the couple so wished: his partner  had  Sri  Lankan
       heritage, they would both have the benefit of  his  family  there  to
       support them, and she could  reasonably  be  expected  to  break  her
       studies if she wished to travel abroad with him for a limited  period
       whilst he sought entry clearance to return. There were  no  Chikwamba
       considerations absent children and given that there were other public
       interest factors in the Respondent's favour.

   10. Pursuant to Rhuppiah at Court of  Appeal  level,  his  mere  lack  of
       recourse to public funds did not  show  financial  independence,  his
       English language facility was in his favour, and his presence in  the
       UK had been consistently precarious; he had been brought  to  the  UK
       for no valid reason, which was a neutral factor, but  had  thereafter
       been complicit in at least part of the delay in resolving  his  case.
       In conclusion, the immigration decision was disruptive  but  overall,
       practical, feasible and proportionate.

   11. Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  13
       November 2018 because it was arguable that the Judge had misevaluated
       the public  interest  as  identified  by  Rule  276B.  This  arguably
       impacted on the assessment of the Article 8 claim in so  far  as  the
       Appellant's application  might  have  met  the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules,  a  relevant  consideration  as  discussed  in  TZ
       (Pakistan).

   12. Before me Mr Georget relied on the  grounds  of  appeal,  emphasising
       that the failure to properly identify the  policy  objective  of  the
       Rule which had been largely satisfied on  this  application.  Indeed,
       given that Rule 276A1 permitted the grant of an extension of leave to
       an individual who satisfied the requirements of the Rule save for the
       Life in the UK test, there had been no inhibition to the grant of the
       Appellant's application,  once  the  allegation  of  overstaying  was
       resolved against the Respondent.

   13. Mr Walker accepted that there was no real answer to  the  Appellant's
       case on this score: there was no doubt that the  Secretary  of  State
       would have taken a different approach  to  the  appeal  had  it  been
       appreciated  there  had  been  no  lawful  service  of  the  historic
       decision, such that the Appellant had in  fact  qualified  under  the
       long lawful residence Rule. However, he pointed out that  there  were
       potential pending criminal proceedings against the  Appellant,  which
       might in time pose an obstacle to the Appellant satisfying  the  good
       character  requirements  of  the  route,  subject  to   their   final
       resolution. Mr Georget replied that the appropriate course of  action
       would be to recognise that there was presently no black mark  against
       the Appellant's character, but for the Respondent to review  this  at
       the time of considering  the  application,  putting  it  on  hold  if
       necessary.

Findings and reasons

   14. Having regard to the submissions of  the  representatives,  I  accept
       that there was a material error of law in this case. Sir Ernest Ryder
       in TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 ï¿½35 stated:


           "The policy of the Secretary of State as expressed in the  Rules
           is not to be ignored when a decision about article 8  is  to  be
           made outside the Rules. An evaluation of  the  question  whether
           there are insurmountable obstacles is a relevant factor  because
           considerable weight is to be placed on the Secretary of  State's
           policy as reflected in the Rules of the circumstances in which a
           foreign national partner should be granted leave to remain.  ...
           That has the benefit that where a person  satisfies  the  Rules,
           whether  or  not  by  reference  to  an   article   8   informed
           requirement, then this will be positively determinative of  that
           person's article 8 appeal, provided their case  engages  article
           8(1), for the very reason that it would then be disproportionate
           for that person to be removed."


   15. Accordingly it is always important for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
       make an accurate assessment of the extent  to  which  an  immigration
       application would meet the requirements of the Rules. In this appeal,
       the consequence of the Judge's acceptance that the Respondent had not
       served the December 2010 refusal upon the Appellant until April  2018
       was that the Appellant, who had lived in the UK  lawfully  since  his
       receipt of DLR over a decade earlier,  was  that  he  was  clearly  a
       candidate who might satisfy the terms of immigration rule 276B.  That
       Rule provides:


           "Long residence in the United Kingdom
           276A. For the purposes of paragraphs 276B to 276D and 276ADE(1).


           ...
           (b) "lawful residence" means residence which is continuous
           residence pursuant to: (i) existing leave to enter or remain; or
           (ii) temporary admission within section 11 of the 1971 Act (as
           previously in force), or immigration bail within section 11 of
           the 1971 Act, where leave to enter or remain is subsequently
           granted;
           ...
           Requirements for an extension of stay on the ground of long
           residence in the United Kingdom
           276A1.The requirement to be met by a person seeking an extension
           of stay on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom is
           that the applicant meets each of the requirements in paragraph
           276B(i)-(ii) and (v).
           ...
           276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite
           leave to remain on the ground of long residence in the United
           Kingdom are that:
           (i) ...he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence
           in the United Kingdom.
           (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons
           why it would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave
           to remain on the ground of long residence, taking into account
           his:
                 (a) age; and
                 (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and
                 (c) personal history, including character, conduct,
                 associations and employment record; and
                 (d) domestic circumstances; and
                 (e) compassionate circumstances; and
                 (f) any representations received on the person's behalf;
                 and
           (iii) the applicant does not fall for refusal under the general
           grounds for refusal.
           (iv) the applicant has demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the
           English language and sufficient knowledge about life in the
           United Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.
           (v) the applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration
           laws, except that, where paragraph 39E of these Rules applies,
           any current period of overstaying will be disregarded. Any
           previous period of overstaying between periods of leave will
           also be disregarded where - (a) the previous application was
           made before 24 November 2016 and within 28 days of the expiry of
           leave; or
           (b) the further application was made on or after 24 November
           2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied."


   16. Thus it can be seen that, as Mr Georget noted in his submissions,  an
       applicant can be granted an extension of leave to remain  where  they
       meet certain requirements within the  long  residence  route,  albeit
       that they do not meet every one of the  criteria  for  settlement.  I
       note that the "general refusal" reasons are also  disapplied  on  the
       extension route. This, however, does not mean that there is  no  good
       character  requirement   on   an   extension   application:   because
       "character" is separately  addressed  within  Rule  276B(ii)(c).  One
       assumes that the  rationale  behind  excluding  the  general  refusal
       reasons from the extension route is to allow scope for limited  leave
       to be granted to an individual who falls foul of  one  of  the  time-
       limited criminality provisions, so that  they  may  "serve  out"  the
       relevant period of time before applying for settlement.


   17. Mr Walker did not suggest that there were any reasons  rendering  the
       grant of leave to the Appellant undesirable by reference to his  age,
       UK connections,  personal  history,  or  domestic  and  compassionate
       circumstances. Indeed all those factors count in his favour.  He  has
       been lawfully resident in the UK for over  a  decade,  including  his
       late teenage years and during early  adulthood,  he  has  connections
       with his foster parents and has friendships here, and he has  studied
       here. Save for the matter I address at the end of my decision,  there
       is no overt reason in his character or conduct to contra-indicate the
       grant of leave as appropriate.


   18. The First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  in  failing  to  consider  the
       relevance of the Appellant's satisfaction of the requirements of  the
       long  residence  route.  Plainly  his  lengthy   residence   and   UK
       connections constituted strong private life ties with  this  country,
       and  so  satisfaction  of  the  Rules  was  highly  relevant  to  the
       assessment of proportionality. Indeed, per Sir Ernest  Ryder  in  TZ,
       this can be a decisive rather than a merely  material  consideration:
       "where a person satisfies the Rules, whether or not by  reference  to
       an article 8 informed  requirement,  then  this  will  be  positively
       determinative of that person's article 8 appeal."

   19. I accordingly find there was a material error of law  in  the  First-
       tier Tribunal's assessment of proportionality.

   20. As invited by the parties, I proceed to determine the appeal finally.
       This is a straightforward exercise, given that, for the reasons  just
       stated, there is presently no factor that counts against the grant of
       leave  to  the  Appellant,  having  regard  to   the   considerations
       identified in the Immigration Rules. All the factors that I have  set
       out above point  in  favour  of  a  grant  of  leave,  which  in  the
       circumstances of this case is decisive of the appeal, as explained in
       TZ.


   21.  For  completeness  I  should  have  regard  to  those   matters   of
       proportionality which statute demands are  examined  on  appeal,  via
       section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  I
       accept that the Appellant is proficient in the English  language,  is
       financially independent (as he receives ï¿½400 monthly  from  a  source
       other than public funds,  which  thus  qualifies  him  as  such,  see
       Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58), and,  whilst  his  position  is  precarious
       given  he  lacks  indefinite  leave  to  remain,  his  situation   is
       effectively condoned by the Immigration Rules, which countenance  the
       grant of leave to someone in his precise position.


   22. I conclude that the Appellant's satisfaction of the Immigration Rules
       means  that  his  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  succeeds;   the
       immigration decision to the contrary is a disproportionate one.

   23. As Mr Walker noted, the Secretary of State is  entitled  to  consider
       criminality  when  determining  an   immigration   application,   and
       information has come to light since the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
       indicating that there is the possibility of proceedings being brought
       against the Appellant  for  some  alleged  wrong-doing.  However,  no
       charges have so far been brought against him. It seems to me that the
       Respondent would be entitled to review the situation at the time this
       application falls to  be  considered,  and  might  wish  to  put  the
       application on hold pending resolution of this issue, in order to see
       whether the Appellant's character continues to qualify  him  for  the
       immigration route in question.


   24. I accordingly allow the appeal.

Decision

The appeal is allowed as the decision  against  which  it  was  brought  was
contrary to the Human Rights Convention.
