Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow
For the Respondent:    Mr P Apraku of Adam Bernard solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The court makes no order in respect of  anonymity.   The  Secretary  of
    State appeals the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  EMM  Smith
    promulgated on 9th April 2019 whereby he allowed the appeal against the
    decision to refuse to grant entry clearance as a spouse.

 2. For convenience I refer to the parties as they were known at the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 3. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by
    Designated Judge Woodcraft on 08th May 2019 on the basis  that  it  was
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge, who dealt with the  matter
    on the papers, had procedurally erred by taking into account  documents
    which had not been served on the respondent.

 4. Turning to the Grounds of Appeal the  first  point  taken  against  the
    decision is that the judge concluded that the financial requirements of
    the spouse rules at appendix FM were met w, failing to  refer  or  make
    findings on the  details  of  the  required  "specified  evidence",  in
    particular the judge does not refer to having seen 6 months'  payslips,
    or evidence showing that salary exceeding ï¿½21,000 had been  paid  prior
    to February 2018.

 5. There is no merit in this ground which failed  to  recognise  that  the
    judge is required to give reasoning adequate  to  the  dispute  on  the
    evidence. The reasons for refusal make plain that the  entry  clearance
    officer had seen 6 months' payslips, so that this was not in issue. The
    reasons for refusal letter, as acknowledged by  Mr  Tarlow  before  me,
    shows that the only dispute  in  respect  of  the  specified  financial
    evidence was that the letter submitted to meet the  requirement  of  an
    employer's letter dated within 28 days of the application submitted  in
    January 2018, was undated. The judge correctly identified  that  issue.
    The judge noted that the letter from the employer  submitted  with  the
    appeal confirmed her employment as having been continual  from  1  July
    2007. The judge reached a conclusion that was open on the evidence when
    finding on the assertion of the respondent, who I note  had  failed  to
    comply with the direction to include in the bundle  the  evidence  upon
    which they relied: which in  this  case  would  have  been  the  letter
    complained about, that in all probability there had been a  failure  in
    respect of the specified evidence submitted  with  the  application  in
    that the letter  probably  was  undated,  but  that  the  evidence  was
    sufficient  to  show  the  substance   of   the   financial   threshold
    requirements of the rules were met at least as at the date of  hearing.
    Before me Mr Tarlow accepted that that was the position.  Additionally,
    contrary to the respondent ECO's point that the appellant had failed to
    provide appendix 2 of the application, it was plainly on the ECO's file
    as the copy provided to the Tribunal by the ECO  showed,  so  that  the
    issue of the employer's letter was the only relevant dispute.

 6. The next point in the grounds relates to the procedure adopted  by  the
    judge. It is said that the judge proceeded to deal with the case on the
    papers when the respondent  had  requested  that  the  appeal  remained
    listed for an oral hearing. Before me Mr Tarlow indicated that  he  was
    unable to proceed with that criticism because  there  was  no  evidence
    that the respondent had made any such request. The grounds assert  that
    the judge proceeded to deal with the appeal on a bundle which  had  not
    been served on the respondent. The relevant  point  here  is  that  the
    letter from the employer referred to above was included in that  bundle
    but not seen by the respondent. The appellant's  representative  before
    me insisted that the document had in fact been served on the respondent
    as per the correspondence dated 04 April 2019 confirming  that  it  was
    served on the respondent POU office in Birmingham by fax.

 7. In the event the dispute fell away when Mr Tarlow took  no  issue  with
    the appellant's representative's point on service, and, having  had  an
    opportunity to review the bundle, acknowledged that on the face of  the
    reasons for refusal letter not only was the  evidence  of  the  undated
    letter from the employer, 6  months'  wages  slips,  P  60's  and  bank
    statements before the entry clearance officer  sufficient  to  show  on
    balance that the substance of the rules were met, it was an appropriate
    case for the entry clearance officer to take  the  discretionary  route
    available under the rules for clarification of the specified  evidence,
    and the failure to exercise that discretion in favour of the  appellant
    could not be explained. In those circumstances Mr Tarlow concurred that
    in the event that I found contrary to the  appellant's  representative,
    the bundle had not been served, so that there was a  procedural  error,
    in terms of materiality there was little that could be advanced because
    in any remaking of the decision  the evidence on its  face  established
    that the decision to allow the appeal on  human  rights  grounds  as  a
    disproportionate  interference  was  open   because  on  the   evidence
    relevant to the dispute I would be entitled to conclude  the  substance
    of the rules were probably met at the date of the decision as  well  as
    hearing.

 8. I find the evidence of the correspondence shows  that  the  appellant's
    representative probably did serve the bundle on the respondent.  Had  I
    concluded otherwise I would  have  remade  the  decision  allowing  the
    appeal for the reasons identified above.


 9. I find no error of law established and the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal allowing the Appellant's appeal stands.

10. I have dismissed the appeal and therefore there can be no fee award.
