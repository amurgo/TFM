Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr D Eteko of Iras & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are nationals of the C�te d'Ivoire.   They  applied  for
    entry clearance as dependent children to join their mother and  sponsor
    F  K  (a  citizen  of  C�te  d'Ivoire)  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    application was refused on 24 December 2018.

2.   The reasons for refusal were first that it was not  accepted  that  the
    appellants were the children of the sponsor as  alleged  because  their
    births were  not  registered  until  2018  and  secondly  that  it  was
    concluded that they had not met the requirements of paragraph 297(i)(a)
    to (f) of HC 395 because  they had not shown that a parent present  and
    settled in  the  United  Kingdom  had  sole  responsibility  for  their
    upbringing.  The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

3.   The sponsor F K gave evidence that she  had  lived  with  the  children
    until she left for the United  Kingdom  in  2008.   She  had  left  the
    children in the care of her niece (A K Y) and following A K  Y's  death
    the children were left in the care of a cousin, (A K).  The  appellants
    had lost their birth certificates when they  moved  house  and  had  to
    obtain new birth certificates in order to obtain new passports.

4.   She said that she was in contact with the appellants every day and  had
    spoken to them on the morning of the hearing and kept  in  contact  via
    WhatsApp, Messenger or an internet calling app, Libon.  The two  eldest
    children had their own phones.

5.   She had visited C�te d'Ivoire in 2013, for two months, and for five  or
    six weeks in 2015.  She had not been able to return subsequently.

6.   She said that she  made  the  decisions  on  education,  schooling  and
    healthcare.  She had a  doctor  in  the  C�te  d'Ivoire  and  when  the
    children were ill she called the doctor and they saw him.  She paid all
    the fees.  It was put to her that there  was  a  lack  of  evidence  of
    contact between her and the doctor of the payment of the fees  and  she
    said the doctor had provided a report, but in fact there was no  report
    in the appellants' bundle.  The sponsor then said that she  sent  money
    to her cousin and they paid the fees.

7.   She said that she sent money to C�te d'Ivoire every month when she  was
    paid, on occasion it was twice a month, depending on their needs.   She
    had started sending money in 2009.  Initially she had sent money to her
    niece via someone else and then got her  own  account  and  sent  money
    directly to the niece.  She named four intermediaries to whom  she  had
    sent money.

8.   She was referred to evidence in  the  bundle  including  a  summary  of
    money transfers she had made between 3 September 2009 and 3 July  2018.
    She was asked who the many different named recipients were  (the  judge
    noting there were at least ten different named recipients) and she said
    they were her cousins, children of her brother  who  had  passed  away.
    She  supported  them  because  her  children  were  there.   She  still
    supported her brother's children because the appellants were with  them
    now.  She was asked how much money she now sent and how often and  said
    that when she was paid and did not have her own money issues  she  sent
    the equivalent of about �400 and she sent money whenever they asked for
    it or needed it and sent money every month no matter what.

9.   She said that  none  of  the  appellants  was  in  contact  with  their
    fathers.  The fathers did not look after them and she  had  no  contact
    with them.  With regard to  a  statement  dated  29  August  2018,  the
    providers of this were her cousin K A and her husband A Y M.   She  was
    referred to a photograph at A20 and said that the photograph in the top
    left corner of the page was her and the appellants  in  2015  when  she
    visited them after her niece had died.

10.  The sponsor's husband K P T gave evidence  and  among  things  he  said
    that they had not been able to apply for the appellants to come to  the
    United  Kingdom  earlier  because  the  sponsor  had  not  had   steady
    employment and had not been granted indefinite  leave  to  remain.   He
    said that no-one but he and the sponsor supported the appellants.

11.  The judge did not accept that the evidence showed that the sponsor  was
    the biological mother of the appellants.  She was concerned by the fact
    that there was nothing linking the appellants' birth certificates  with
    the granting of the passports.  She expressed some surprise that no DNA
    test results have been provided to establish the parental link  between
    the sponsor and the appellants.

12.  She found that in the alternative had she found the  appellants  to  be
    the biological children of the sponsor she would have not have accepted
    that the appellant had shown sole responsibility.  The  appellants  had
    shown that the sponsor had made many payments over a long period  to  a
    large number of people in C�te d'Ivoire.  She considered there  was  no
    evidence to the standard of proof required that the payments were  made
    for the upkeep  of  the  appellants.   The  brief  statement  from  the
    sponsor's cousin and her husband, to which I have referred above,  said
    no more than that they confirmed that since  her  departure  from  C�te
    d'Ivoire the sponsor had entrusted her three children to them and  they
    had been caring for  them  since   under  her  directions.   The  judge
    observed that this was entirely inadequate as a piece of  evidence  and
    that  it  consisted  of  one  sentence  of  actual  evidence   and   it
    contradicted the sponsor's evidence  because  it  said  that  they  had
    looked after the appellants since the  sponsor's  departure  from  C�te
    d'Ivoire.  She went on to consider the application of section 55 of the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to the facts of the  case
    and concluded that the decision appealed  again  would  not  cause  the
    United Kingdom to be in breach in its Article 8 obligations because the
    appellants had not shown exceptional circumstances  and  refusal  would
    not result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellants  such
    that refusal of their applications would not be proportionate.

13.  The appellants sought and were granted  permission  to  appeal  against
    this decision on both grounds.

14.  Subsequently the results of DNA tests were  provided  to  the  Tribunal
    which showed conclusively  that  the  appellants  are  related  to  the
    sponsor as claimed.

15.  In the circumstances Mr Clarke said  that  he  did  not  challenge  the
    appeal with regard to the relationship between the appellants  and  the
    sponsor and also accepted that the judge's findings at paragraph 64  of
    the decision were probably flawed in the assessment of  Article  8  and
    the  weight  attached  to  the  failure   to   establish   a   parental
    relationship.  He maintained however the argument with regard  to  sole
    responsibility.

16.  In his submissions Mr Eteko argued that  considering  the  totality  of
    all the evidence on a balance of probabilities the sponsor had made out
    her case.  He referred to the evidence in the bundle at page 10 to page
    111 and at pages 157 to 173.  The sponsor had  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom and was the only person who had been looking after the children
    and took all the decisions affecting their  lives.   The  Secretary  of
    State had not challenged this evidence.  The decision  to  entrust  the
    appellants to a family member was solely taken by the sponsor and  also
    after the death of her niece she had decided to ask her cousin to  look
    after them and decided to bring them to the United  Kingdom.   She  was
    not a big earner and the cost of the application  and  the  appeal  had
    been significant.  There was a clear indication of a keen interest  vis
    a vis her children.  This could be seen for example in  the  record  of
    payments at page 71 of the bundle.  The judge's findings with regard to
    the evidence was inadequate and she had  failed  to  look  at  all  the
    evidence and take it at its face value.  In fact she  had  accepted  at
    face value what the Presenting Officer had said.  In light of  all  the
    evidence sole responsibility was made out and it was relevant  to  bear
    in mind that it could be for a short period as held in the case law.

17.  In his submissions, Mr Clarke  argued  that  there  were  really  three
    issues.  First, that the judge had applied the wrong test, second  that
    she had failed to take into account relevant evidence  and  third  with
    regard to the inconsistency point  as  between  the  sponsors  and  the
    cousin's evidence.

18.  On the first point, it was clear that the judge had set  out  the  test
    correctly as could be seen from paragraph 53 of her decision.  She  was
    clearly aware that the test  was  whether  the  parent  had  continuing
    control and direction over the child's upbringing, including making all
    the important decisions in their life.

19.  With regard to the second point, though Mr  Clarke  did  not  have  the
    appellants' bundle, Mr Eteko had confirmed the relevant pages and  that
    they were not translated.  Rule 12(5)(b) required  translation  so  the
    judge could not  be  criticised  for  not  taking  that  evidence  into
    account.

20.  As regards the contention that the judge has not  taken  the  sponsor's
    visits to the C�te d'Ivoire into account and the argument that she  had
    not considered the entrusting of care to relatives  and  the  sponsor's
    decision to bring the children to the United Kingdom, it was clear that
    the entrusting of care to relatives had been considered, for example at
    paragraph 57 and the comments with regard to the cousin's evidence.  As
    regards the other matters, there was no mention of those at  paragraphs
    57 to 59, but in light of the test in TD (Yemen)  [2006]  UKAIT  00049,
    the sponsor had only made two visits to the C�te d'Ivoire, in 2013  and
    2015 and it was impossible to see how that could be probative  of  care
    and control and likewise with regard  to  the  decision  to  bring  the
    appellants to the United Kingdom, as that  was  a  prerequisite  to  an
    application.

21.  As regards the issue of the inconsistency, the judge had been  entitled
    to find as she did in that regard at paragraph 57.

22.  By way of reply Mr  Eteko  accepted  that  some  of  the  evidence  was
    untranslated but it could not be looked at in isolation.  It had to  be
    considered in the light of all the  other  evidence  produced  for  the
    appeal.  The key issue was the real world situation that responsibility
    would have been shared as the sponsor would have  left  the  family  at
    home so the children had to be left with family members but because the
    sponsor could not take the children to school every day and  was  in  a
    different country the question was who had the last word with regard to
    the children's lives.  In the light of the  evidence  the  sponsor  had
    shown that she was that person.  She had made the applications for them
    to come and had arranged for the DNA test and the  case  was  therefore
    made out.  The  judge  had  been  swayed  by  her  findings  about  the
    relationship and it was more likely that if that mistake had  not  been
    made she would have come to a different finding.

23.  I reserved my decision.

24.  The outstanding issue, by agreement is  that  of  sole  responsibility.
    As the judge clearly understood, at her paragraph 53, where one  parent
    is not involved in  the  child's  upbringing  because  she  or  he  has
    abandoned or abdicated responsibility the issue may arise  between  the
    remaining parent and others who  have  day-to-day  care  of  the  child
    abroad.  The test is whether the  parent  has  continuing  control  and
    direction  over  the  child's  upbringing  including  making  all   the
    important decisions in the child's life.

25.  I have set out above the sponsor's oral evidence  with  regard  to  the
    care and control that she exercises in respect of her children.

26.  In her witness statement, dated 28 January 2020, she said that she  had
    decided to entrust her children to her now deceased niece.  She herself
    supported them financially and visited them  regularly  and  after  the
    death of her niece she entrusted her children to her cousin.  She  said
    that in light of the financial position of her and her husband they had
    to plan, save money and allow time for her children and her  spouse  to
    establish bonds and they made the decision to apply for the children to
    join them in 2018.   Her  evidence  is  essentially  supported  by  her
    husband's witness statement of the same date.

27.  As has been noted, a good  deal  of  the  evidence  in  the  bundle  is
    untranslated and therefore the judge, as Mr Clarke  argued,  cannot  be
    criticised for not taking it into  consideration.   The  only  evidence
    from those in whose care the children were placed in C�te  d'Ivoire  is
    the joint statement of the sponsor's cousin and her husband, to which I
    have referred above.  As I also noted above, the  judge  observed  that
    the sponsor had made many payments over a long period to a large number
    of people in the C�te d'Ivoire and the evidence did not show  that  the
    payments were made for the upkeep of the appellants.  I have  not  been
    taken and nor does it appear that the judge  was  taken  to  any  other
    evidence to go to show the necessary continuing control  and  direction
    over the children's upbringing.  As the judge observed,  there  was  no
    documentary corroboration such as  a  report  from  a  doctor  who  the
    sponsor said she paid to treat the appellants.  The report she said had
    been provided was in fact not in the bundle and has not been  produced.



28.  In my view the judge was fully entitled to conclude  as  she  did  with
    regard to sole responsibility.  There was, as noted above, a dearth  of
    evidence to show the necessary continuing control and direction and the
    making of all the important decisions in the children's lives.   It  is
    the case that the judge did not specifically refer to the fact  of  the
    two visits that the sponsor made to C�te d'Ivoire, other than recording
    those visits in this regard,  at  paragraph  21.   But,  as  Mr  Clarke
    argued, it is impossible to see how that can be said to be probative of
    care and control.  Likewise with regard to the decision  to  bring  the
    children to the United Kingdom, that is of course, as  Mr  Clarke  also
    observed, a prerequisite to a case being brought  in  respect  of  this
    Immigration Rule.  There is no materiality  to  the  failure  to  refer
    specifically to either of those matters.  There is also the point  that
    the judge was entitled  to  attach  relevance  to  the  fact  that  the
    statement of the sponsor's cousin and her husband was on the  one  hand
    very brief and also contradictory of her evidence.

29.  As a consequence I consider that the judge was entitled to conclude  as
    she did about sole responsibility in this case.  Though  it  is  common
    ground that she erred with regard to the relationship, her decision  on
    sole responsibility has not been shown to be marred by any error of law
    and as a consequence her decision dismissing the appeal in this case is
    maintained.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
