The finding in AM (Ethiopia),[2008] EWCA  Civ  1082,  that  the  Immigration
Rules have no over-arching purpose and must be construed sensibly  according
to the natural meaning of the language employed, is an approach approved  by
the Supreme Court in Ahmed Mahad and others [2009] UKSC 16.   The  existence
of paragraph 245V, which describes the purpose of  the  Tier  1  (post-study
work) "route",  does  not  entitle  decision  makers  to  re-write  specific
requirements of the Rules, which  are  on  their  face  sufficiently  plain,
whether or not a judicial  fact-finder  thinks  the  provision  in  question
might  have  been  differently  phrased,   compatibly   with   the   purpose
articulated in paragraph 245V.





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born on 16  March  1980,  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 12  September  2004  as  a  student.   He  was
    subsequently granted variations of leave to  remain  in  that  capacity
    until 10 December 2007, when he was granted a  variation  of  leave  to
    remain as a participant of the International Graduate Scheme  until  10
    December 2008.  On  14  November  2008  the  appellant  applied  for  a
    variation of leave, to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1  (post-
    study work) migrant.  On 3 February 2009  the  respondent  refused  the
    appellant's application.

2.    The appellant appealed against that decision to  the  Tribunal,  which
    heard his appeal at Hatton Cross on  2  April  2009.   The  Immigration
    Judge allowed the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.  On 3
    July 2009 reconsideration  of  the  Immigration  Judge's  decision  was
    ordered under section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002, on the application of the respondent, who contended that  the
    Immigration Judge had erred in law by having regard to the  appellant's
    overdraft facility in the  sum  of  �2,000,  notwithstanding  that  the
    appellant did not have what was  said  by  the  respondent  to  be  the
    requisite �800 of savings available to him at the material times  prior
    to the making of the application.

3.    The letter of decision of 3 February 2009 sent by  the  respondent  to
    the appellant stated that the appellant had claimed 10 points for funds
    under Appendix C of  the  Immigration  Rules  but  that  the  documents
    provided by the appellant "do not demonstrate that  you  have  been  in
    possession of �800 for the  period  specified  in  the  guidance.   The
    Secretary of State is therefore not satisfied that you have achieved 10
    points under Appendix C of the Immigration Rules."  The letter went  on
    to say that the appellant accordingly did not satisfy the  requirements
    of the Immigration  Rules  and  it  had  been  decided  to  refuse  his
    application under paragraph 245Z as he did not meet the requirement  of
    paragraph 245Z(e).

4.    The relevant part of paragraph 245Z reads (or  at  the  relevant  date
    read) as follows:-

        "245Z. Requirements for leave to remain


           To qualify for leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (post-study  work)
        migrant, an applicant must  meet  the  requirements  listed  below.
        Subject  to  paragraph  245ZA(i),  if  the  applicant  meets  these
        requirements, leave to remain will be granted.   If  the  applicant
        does not meet these requirements, the application will be refused.


          Requirements:


          ...


          (e) The applicant must have a minimum of 10 points under  Appendix
             C."

5.    Appendix C to the Rules deals with maintenance (funds).  The  relevant
    provisions read as follows:-


        "1. An applicant applying for entry clearance or leave to remain as
        a Tier 1 Migrant (other than as a Tier 1 (Investor)  Migrant)  must
        score 10 points for funds.


        2. 10 points will only be awarded if an applicant:


        ...


        (b) applying for leave to remain, has the level of funds  shown  in
        the table below and
        provides the specified documents.


        |Level of funds                     |Points                        |
|�800                               |10                            |


        3. The applicant must have the funds specified in paragraph 2 above
        at the date of the application and must also have had  those  funds
        for a period of  time  set  out  in  the  guidance  specifying  the
        specified documents for the purposes of paragraph 2 above."

6.    Paragraph 91 of  the  relevant  guidance  stated  that,  in  order  to
    qualify for leave to remain,

        "applicants must show  that  they  have  enough  money  to  support
        themselves.  The funds requirements are detailed below.


        ...


           . applicants in the  United  Kingdom  seeking  Further  leave  to
             remain must have at least �800 of personal savings."


7.    Under the heading "Documents we require", the guidance  required  that
    the relevant evidence "must be  in  the  form  of  cash  funds.   Other
    accounts or financial instruments such as shares, bonds, pension  funds
    etc, regardless of notice period are  not  acceptable."   Referring  to
    Appendix C as stating that "only specified documents will  be  accepted
    as evidence  of  this  requirement,  the  guidance  then  set  out  the
    specified documents as being:-

        "1. Personal bank or building society statements covering the three-
        month period immediately before the application: the personal  bank
        or building society statements should clearly show:


           . the applicant's name;

           . the account number;

           . the account of the statement;

           . the financial institution's name and logo;

           . transactions covering the three-month period;

           . that there are sufficient funds present  in  the  account  (the
             balance  must  always  be  at  least   �2,800   or   �800,   as
             appropriate)."

8.    At paragraph 30 of his determination, the Immigration Judge wrote:-

        "13.     The Appellant has 2 accounts at Barclays Bank, the first a
             current account which has an overdraft limit of  �1,500  and  a
             reserve limit of �500.   The  appellant  also  has  a  nest-egg
             savings account with Barclays Bank.  The appellant had in  that
             savings account on  the  15  August  �13,000  and  �12,000  was
             withdrawn by him and paid in to his current  account  which  he
             subsequently withdrew in cash in order to make a  loan  to  his
             uncle and the loan in cash was made to his uncle  in  September
             2008 and there is an  affidavit  from  the  appellant's  uncle,
             being document 35 in the appellant's  bundle,  confirming  that
             loan was made to [the uncle]."

9.    At paragraph 14, the Immigration Judge referred to  judicial  comments
    taken from a case he referred to as "Obed and Others" (generally  known
    as GOO and others [2008] EWCA Civ 747), in which  it  was  said  to  be
    relevant to recall that the admission of  foreign  nationals  to  study
    helped to  maintain  English  as  the  world's  principal  language  of
    commerce, law and science and furnished a source of revenue, which  was
    of importance to the United Kingdom's universities and colleges as well
    as to many independent schools.  At paragraph 15, the Immigration Judge
    considered that although that statement had been made in relation to  a
    student appeal "it could be argued  that  the  whole  purpose  of  this
    Immigration Rule is to allow the skills and knowledge  acquired  by  an
    applicant to be used for employment  and  such  skills  would  aid  the
    economy".

10.   After those observations, the Immigration Judge  turned  at  paragraph
    16 to the analysis of the appellant's  actual  case.   The  Immigration
    Judge noted that in the application form the question at N1  was  "Does
    the  applicant  have  access  to  �800  available  funds   to   support
    themselves?" (Immigration Judge's  emphasis).   The  Immigration  Judge
    then referred to the policy guidance and in particular the statement at
    paragraph 91 that "Applicants in the  United  Kingdom  seeking  further
    leave  to  remain  must  have  at  least  �800  of  personal   savings"
    (Immigration Judge's emphasis).

11.   It is common ground that, in the remainder of the  determination,  the
    Immigration  Judge  wrongly  described  the  Policy  Guidance   as   an
    Immigration Directorate  Instructions  (IDI).   At  paragraph  17,  the
    Immigration Judge said that the IDIs "are silent as to what the meaning
    of 'personal savings' (sic) and equally the IDIs are silent  about  the
    existence of overdraft facilities available on specific accounts".  The
    Immigration Judge continued in paragraph 18 by noting that the case  of
    ZH (Bangladesh) [2009] EWCA Civ 8 had been cited to  him  in  argument.
    Compressing what Sedley LJ said in paragraph 32  of  the  judgments  in
    that case, the Immigration Judge purported to note that  "an  IDI  does
    not have and cannot be treated as [if] it possessed the force of law...
     The IDI must have a legitimate bearing in the sense that it  would  be
    wrong for the Immigration Judge to adjudicate in ignorance of it."

12.   After referring to AM (Ethiopia) [2008] EWCA Civ 1082 and  Ahmed  Iram
    Ishtiaq [2007] EWCA Civ 386 [2007] EWCA Civ 386, the Immigration  Judge
    found as follows:-

        "21.     Applying the  above  cases,  together  with  the  IDIs  in
             respect of this particular Immigration Rule, whilst it is clear
             that the Appellant did not have a credit of �800 for the  whole
             period of the 3 months immediately preceding  his  application,
             i.e. in October, September and August, nevertheless he did have
             the benefit of an overdraft facility which amounted in total to
             �2,000.


        22.      If one construed literally the wording of the IDI guidance
             that the Appellant had  to  have  �800  of  "personal  savings"
             meaning a credit then it would have been open to the  Appellant
             to have utilised that overdraft facility, withdrawn  money  and
             put it in a savings account.  As it was, he  did  not  need  to
             utilise that facility  although  he  had  the  benefit  of  the
             facility and therefore it can be urged that  he  had  at  least
             �800 or more available to him throughout the period.


        13.      Furthermore, for the period in which the Appellant did not
             have more than �800 in his bank account was [sic] a period that
             coincided with him loaning to his uncle �13,000 and there is  a
             clear financial trail of how  that  money  was  loaned  to  his
             uncle.  He did this at  the  time  he  was  in  expectation  of
             receiving a  bonus  from  his  employers  and  which  has  been
             confirmed by his employers and was expecting and would normally
             have received that bonus at the time when his account was  less
             than �800.  As it was, he did  not  receive  that  bonus  until
             February 2009.


        14.      I have concluded that if one uses a common sense  approach
             to these issues and look at the reason for the Immigration Rule
             and how the IDIs should be interpreted in relation to a  person
             such as the Appellant with the financial facilities  that  were
             available to the Appellant, namely an overdraft notwithstanding
             the fact that he did not actually use that,  coupled  with  the
             fact that there is evidence of the  Appellant  being  a  person
             with financial means, namely that he has the ability to loan an
             uncle �13,000 and he  has  a  property  in  Pakistan  which  is
             currently valued  at  over  �55,000  and  has  been  adequately
             supported by his father and his uncle when he was a student  in
             the United  Kingdom,  that  he  does  satisfy  245Z(e)  of  the
             Immigration Rules.


        15.      I therefore find  that  the  Decision  of  the  Respondent
             appealed against is  not  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
             Immigration Rules."

16.    In  his  submissions  in   support   of   the   Immigration   Judge's
    determination, Mr Solomon, who had also  appeared  before  that  judge,
    relied upon his reply, served pursuant to rule 30,  in  which  he  made
    reference  to  the  case  law  mentioned  by  the  Immigration   Judge.
    According to Mr Solomon, Appendix C to the Immigration Rules,  properly
    construed, "contains a discretion allowing the respondent  to  consider
    the appellant's overall financial position".  The  policy  guidance  in
    question was "guidance only".  The approach adopted by the  Immigration
    Judge was in accordance with paragraph 245V of the  Immigration  Rules,
    which states that the purpose of the Tier 1 (post-study  work)  migrant
    route is "to encourage international graduates who have studied in  the
    UK to stay on and do skilled or highly-skilled  work".   Alternatively,
    the wording of paragraph 245Z(e), Appendix C and  the  policy  guidance
    "does not exclude loans or overdrafts and therefore it  was  reasonably
    open to the judge to take account of these in assessing the maintenance
    requirement".

17.   The quotation cited by the Immigration Judge in paragraph  19  of  his
    determination, as coming from AM (Ethiopia), in fact originates in  the
    approach to the interpretation of the Immigration  Rules  commended  by
    Lord Roskill in Alexander [1982] 1 WLR 1076 at p1080G:-

        "[The Rules] must be construed sensibly according  to  the  natural
        meaning of the language which is employed.  [They] give guidance to
        the various officers concerned and contain  statements  of  general
        policy  regarding  the  operation  of  the   relevant   immigration
        legislation."

18.   That  was  the  approach  employed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AM
    (Ethiopia), as is apparent from paragraph 55  of  the  judgments  (Laws
    LJ); an approach now approved by the Supreme  Court  (Ahmed  Mahad  and
    others [2009] UKSC 16; paragraph 10 (Lord Brown)).   What  is  said  in
    paragraph 55  about  the  Immigration  Rules  having  no  "over-arching
    policy", whilst remaining true of the Immigration Rules as a whole,  is
    subject to the qualification that, as regards the type of case - Tier 1
    (post-study work) migrant - with which we are concerned, paragraph 245V
    does, as we have seen, set out  the  purpose  of  "this  route",  which
    plainly includes paragraph 245Z and the relevant appendices.

19.   Nevertheless, the existence  of  paragraph  245V  can  in  no  way  be
    regarded as entitling decision  makers,  including  this  Tribunal,  to
    rewrite specific requirements of the Rules, which  are  on  their  face
    sufficiently plain.  That is so, whether or not a judicial  fact-finder
    thinks that the provision  in  question  might  have  been  differently
    phrased, compatibly with the purpose articulated in paragraph 245V.

20.   The Immigration Judge's reliance upon Ishtiaq was misconceived, as  is
    the  appellant's  submission  that  Appendix  C,  properly   construed,
    contains  a  discretion  allowing  the  respondent   to   consider   an
    appellant's overall financial position.  Ishtiaq  concerned  the  quite
    different question of whether an IDI had the effect  of  circumscribing
    the  discretion  of  a  caseworker  under  paragraph  289A(v)  of   the
    Immigration Rules in deciding what evidence to require an applicant  to
    produce in a case  involving  alleged  domestic  violence.   That  case
    cannot be used as an interpretive tool in relation to Appendix  C.   As
    can be  seen,  paragraph  2  of  Appendix  C  contains  no  element  of
    discretion.  10 points will only be awarded if  an  applicant  has  the
    level of funds shown in the table and provides the specified documents.
     The "level of  funds"  is  "�800".   Paragraph  3  provides  that  the
    applicant must have those funds for a period of time  set  out  in  the
    guidance.  Notwithstanding Mr Solomon's  submission  to  the  contrary,
    there is nothing remotely discretionary in any of  this.   Furthermore,
    these requirements are in the Immigration Rules themselves  (albeit  an
    Appendix), rather than in the  policy  guidance.   The  Concise  Oxford
    Dictionary defines a fund as a "permanent stock of something  ready  to
    be drawn upon; or a stock of money, especially  one  set  apart  for  a
    purpose".  Thus, even before one comes to the relevant policy guidance,
    it is by no means plain, as a matter of construction, that an overdraft
    facility, which concerns the bank's stock  of  money  rather  than  the
    applicant's, can be said to represent the funds of the applicant.

21.   We do not find that ZH (Bangladesh) assists the appellant.  That  case
    concerned the interpretation at paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules
    (requirements for indefinite leave to remain  on  the  ground  of  long
    residence  in  the  United  Kingdom).   Paragraph   276B   contains   a
    requirement for the decision maker to  have  regard  to  a  variety  of
    matters, including the personal circumstances  and  background  of  the
    applicant, in reaching a decision as to whether it would be undesirable
    for that person to be given indefinite leave to remain on the ground of
    long residence.  The Court of Appeal dealt with the IDI  of  May  2007,
    which sought to guide the respondent's caseworkers in how  to  approach
    their task in this regard.  The IDI in that case was held not to be  an
    aid to the construction of  the  Rule.   The  policy  guidance  in  the
    present case, however, is not relied on by the respondent as an aid  to
    the construction of the relevant Rules, including Appendix C.  Instead,
    the policy guidance is the means by which the requirement in  paragraph
    3 of Appendix C, to have the relevant funds for a particular period  of
    time, is given effect. It is also the means  by  which  the  respondent
    gives expression to the requirement  in  Appendix  C  to  produce  "the
    specified documents".

22.   This was made plain by the Tribunal in paragraph 46  of  NA  &  Others
    (Tier 1 - post-study work  -  funds)  [2009]  UKAIT  00025,  where  the
    Tribunal found that:-

        "There are two respects in which the rules treat  the  guidance  as
        determinative: as to the period of time for which an applicant must
        show he has had the requisite �800 in maintenance (funds) and as to
        the type of documents he must produce  to  evidence  that.   Unlike
        some items of Home Office policy, the policy guidance does not seek
        or purport to set out, and is not to be confused  with  a  document
        setting  out,  matters  of  Home  Office  policy  that   exist   as
        concessions outside the Rules.  Unlike UKBA Immigration Directorate
        Instructions (IDIs) which albeit in the public  realm  are  written
        for  UKBA  staff,  the  policy  guidance  is  clearly  written  for
        potential applicants.  As such it is something on which  applicants
        are entitled to rely as accurate  and  reliable  information  about
        what is expected  of  them  if  they  wish  to  qualify  under  the
        Immigration Rules.  The policy guidance appears, therefore, to be a
        hybrid of a new kind, being guidance expressly for  applicants  and
        containing some provisions that are integral to  the  understanding
        and operation of the relevant Immigration Rules."

23.   In the present case, the appellant was, and is, unable to produce  the
    specified documents, since his bank statements fail to show  that,  for
    the relevant period,  there  were  "sufficient  funds  present  in  the
    account (the balance must  always  be  at  least  �2,800  or  �800,  as
    appropriate)".    Those   requirements   admitted   of   no   purposive
    construction, such as the Immigration Judge mentioned in paragraphs  22
    to 24 of  his  determination.   The  overdraft  facility  was  not  the
    equivalent of funds in the appellant's  account.   The  fact  that  the
    appellant had loaned his uncle �13,000 was, likewise, not evidence that
    the appellant had those funds at the relevant times; nor was  the  fact
    that the appellant appeared to have received his employee's bonus later
    than he was anticipating.

24.   Finally, Mr Solomon sought to rely upon paragraph  95  of  the  policy
    guidance issued in respect of applications made on or  after  31  March
    2009.  This reads:-

        "95.     The evidence of maintenance must be cash funds in the bank
             (this includes savings accounts and current accounts even  when
             notice must be given), loan or official financial or government
             sponsorship available to  the  applicant.   Other  accounts  or
             financial instruments such as  shares,  bonds,  pension  funds,
             etc, regardless of notice period, are not acceptable."

25.   If the reference in paragraph 95 of  the  new  guidance  to  a  "loan"
    represents a substantive change, compared with the guidance with  which
    we are concerned, the appellant's case, far  from  being  strengthened,
    faces the difficulty that the previous wording did not cover  loans  of
    any kind.  If, on the other hand, Mr  Solomon's  intention  is  to  use
    paragraph 95 as an aid to the construction of  Appendix  C,  this  runs
    counter to the judgments of the Court of Appeal in relation to IDI's in
    ZH (Bangladesh), besides being  based  on  a  misunderstanding  of  the
    substantive role played by the guidance in  the  points  based  scheme.
    Finally,  the  new  policy  guidance  continues  to  require  specified
    documents, the nature  of  which  do  not  assist  the  appellant.   In
    particular, the personal bank etc. statements are required to show:-

        ". that there are enough funds present in the account (the  balance
             must always be at least �2,800 or �800 as appropriate)."

26.  As the Tribunal recently said in PO (Points based scheme:  maintenance:
    loans) Nigeria [2009] UKAIT  00047,  this  "is  a  simple  and  readily
    intelligible requirement. Documents which fail to show a balance at the
    required level simply are not  evidence  of  the  requirements  of  the
    points based scheme" (paragraph 5).

Decision

27.   The Immigration Judge made a material error of law and we  accordingly
    substitute for it a decision dismissing the  appellant's  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules.


Signed


Senior Immigration Judge P R Lane
