                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Singer, Counsel, instructed by Bhattarai & Co
                    Immigration Practice


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the appellant  is  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    Respondent is the Claimant.  At a  hearing  on  4  September  2014  for
    reasons given and set out in my determination, dated 9  September  2014
    I decided that the judge had made  a  number  of  errors  of  law,  the
    Original Tribunal decision could not stand and the decision would  have
    to be remade.

2.   At the hearing 1 December 2014 Mr Singer indicated  that  the  Claimant
    did not wish to take further part in the  process,  was  proceeding  to
    leave the UK and go, possibly, to another European country.  His client
    was present at the hearing.  It is plain  that  the  Claimant  was  not
    opposing the outcome which the Secretary of State sought i.e. that  the
    appeal against the Secretary of State's decision should be dismissed.

3.   Whilst Mr Singer referred to the appeal being  withdrawn,  it  was  not
    for his client to do so but I am satisfied the Claimant did not  intend
    to oppose the Secretary of State's appeal. Accordingly, unless  I  hear
    to the contrary within 5 days of the date of this decision,  I  propose
    to allow the Secretary of State's appeal and dismiss the appeal  of  Mr
    Pushpala against the Secretary of States' decision  dated  20  November
    2013.  I am satisfied that the Claimant does not seek  to  continue  to
    contest the Secretary of State's appeal.

Anonymity

4.   No anonymity order was sought and none is appropriate or necessary.
