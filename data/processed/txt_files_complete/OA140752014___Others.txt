For the Respondents:   Mr Adophy, Solicitor Advocate


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondents are referred to as the Claimants.

2.   The Claimants, dates of birth respectively 5 June  1970,  21  September
    2000 and 17 August 1996, nationals of the People's Republic  of  China,
    appealed against decisions of the  ECO  refusing  leave  to  enter  for
    settlement as the spouse and two daughters of the Sponsor Mr M  L  (the
    Sponsor).  Their applications came before the ECO  who  on  10  October
    2014 refused them,  amongst  other  reasons,  on  the  basis  that  the
    specified evidence required  to  demonstrate  the  necessary  financial
    requirements of the Rules had not been provided.

3.     In particular reliance had been placed upon the fact  that  deposited
    amounts into the Sponsor's bank account with the TSB  in  the  required
    period were less than the required gross annual income for the  Sponsor
    in order to maintain the Claimants.  In  particular  reliance  was  put
    upon the fact that the payslips provided, it seems  with  possibly  one
    missing wage slip for 3 March 2014, showed the gross pay and net pay to
    the Sponsor but in a number of examples they did  not  tally  with  the
    credits in the bank statements.

4.   Their appeals came before First-tier Tribunal Khawar (the  judge)  who,
    on 2 October 2015, allowed them under the immigration rules.

5.   Permission to appeal those  decisions  was  given  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge PJM Hollingsworth on 24 February 2016.

6.    At the hearing on 4 May 2016 the exercise had been conducted,  by  the
    Senior Presenting Officer, which indicated that the bank account credit
    entries of 21 March, 11 April, 18 April, 25 April, 2 May,  16  May,  30
    May, 13 June, and 27 June 2014 did  not  directly  match  the  net  pay
    received.  Accordingly it was  said  was  that  irrespective  of  other
    evidence the required evidence of maintenance did not meet the specific
    requirements of the Rules for the given period  prescribed.  Also,  the
    evidence did not when correlated  show  those  totals  amounted  on  an
    annualised basis to the required level of maintenance.

7.   The form of Appendix FM-SE in the context of Appendix  FM  is  intended
    to be a specific and clear recital of the requirements which,  if  met,
    go to show that permission for leave to enter should be granted.

8.   It is clear from the case of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387  that  the
    position is unchanged, as referred to in earlier case law, that a  near
    miss in terms of not meeting the requirements of specific rules is  not
    a basis for the exercise of any discretion by the Tribunal to avoid the
    requirements of the Rules.  If there is a discretion it is one for  the
    ECO to exercise outside  of  the  Rules.   Given  the  absence  of  any
    exercise of discretion it is clear as a matter of law  that  the  ECO's
    decision not to exercise a discretion is not justiciable.

9.   Mr Adophy argued, with a certain tenacity, that  if  you  look  at  the
evidence in the round including  for  example  the  relevant  P60  or  other
evidence the fact  that  you  may  not  have  met  the  specific  evidential
requirements does not stand  against  the  full  consideration  of  such  an
application by the ECO.

10.  Mr Adophy   relied  upon  the  wording  of  Appendix  FM-SE.  Paragraph
    A1.1(aa)(iii)(n) which allows the gross amount of any cash  income  may
    be counted where the person's specified bank statement  shows  the  net
    amount; which relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips.  The
    problem with Mr Adophy's argument is that the net  amount  of  pay  did
    not, in most cases, reflect  the  amounts  paid  in  to  the  Sponsor's
    account. Thus as the paragraph  provides,"...otherwise,  only  the  net
    amount shown on the specified on the bank statements may be counted."


11.   I concluded the error  of  law  the  judge  made,  for  understandable
    reasons but nevertheless remained an error, was to assume that  it  was
    acceptable to  avoid  the  evidential  shortcomings  in  the  specified
    evidence required by reference to (a) a credibility finding  in  favour
    of the Sponsor; and (b) an acceptance that  other  evidence  in  effect
    mirrored the gross amount, banked as a  net  amount,  less  unexplained
    deductions.
12.     It is a surprising feature of the appeal in which Mr Adophy did  not
    appear, that no-one sat down and did the calculations of total  of  pay
    and bank account  statements and/or cross-reference  the  documents  to
    see whether the ECO's  basis  for  refusal   was  correct  as  a  fact.
    Ultimately it seemed to have been accepted, although I  have  not  done
    the calculations, that the differences between the amounts  banked  and
    the net pay after deductions are material but there was no  explanation
    given as to why they are different.
13.    There is no obvious reason, for example the sum of �383 was  paid  as
    wages but a sum of �380.68 was banked  on  for  example  30  May  2014.
    Helpfully Mr Adophy has drawn to my attention or read to me  that  part
    of the Sponsor's statement about these matters but that has  ultimately
    not shed any light on why the sums were different.   Why  the  marginal
    reductions were made, not so much in pennies but in  very  few  pounds,
    and why, when confronted by the refusal if the  Sponsor  could  clearly
    meet the financial requirements, he  made  no  further  application  to
    address the identified shortfall in the evidence was unexplained.

14.  It seemed to me barely  conceivable,  whatever  else  the  ECO  may  be
    capable of doing, if there had not  been  an  appropriate  explanation,
    given as to the realities of the  position  and  connected  with  other
    supporting documentation why the ECO  could  not  have  been  asked  to
    exercise a discretion outside  the  Rules.   The  significance  of  the
    shortfall did not fundamentally undermine the sufficiency of funding to
    maintain the Appellants.  However, that may be simply  the  benefit  of
    hindsight but it does go to show why, when the Rules are so specific as
    to the requirements, the greatest care needs to be paid to making  sure
    that those requirements are met.

15.    I do not criticise those acting for the Claimants but  it  seemed  to
    me that a little more thought needed to be given to this matter  rather
    than perhaps, if this was the case, taking a broad view that  it  could
    all come alright in the end.  Accordingly  I  was  satisfied  that  the
    judge did make an error of law when he allowed the  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

16.  The further point is taken against the judge by the Claimants  is  that
    the judge did not address Article 8 ECHR.  It seemed  to  me  that  the
    judge's approach to Article 8  as  contained  within  the  decision  at
    paragraph 31 where he allowed the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules
    was probably, as Mr Adophy, says because the appeal  in   his  judgment
    had succeeded under the Rules there was no need to look  at  Article  8
    ECHR.  Such explanation may be  right  but it is extremely hard to  see
    in the light of the case of SS (Congo)[2015] EWCA Civ 387 how it can be
    thought that where someone for practical reasons cannot meet a specific
    evidence requirement the case falls to be considered under  Article  8.
    Amongst other things there is no need to have  recourse  to  Article  8
    because there is the clear remedy of making a further application.

17.    Whilst, as a matter of approach, seeking to reunite a family  and  to
    restore family life may well engage Article 8(1) rights,  it  does  not
    get round the consideration of  the  ECO's  decision  being  lawful  or
    meeting the  requirements  of  Article  8(2)  nor  does  it  avoid  the
    consequence, where the Rules do make provision to enable family life to
    be re-established. It is hard to see how it is then disproportionate to
    apply those Rules.  If there was something in the Claimants'  situation
    which was outside of the  Rules  and  was  exceptional,  that  was  not
    apparent in the judge's decision nor on the  evidence  and  submissions
    made to me.    Whilst it is possible to assert that  it  would  not  be
    disproportionate to have allowed the appeal under Article 8,  the  fact
    is to follow that course is simply to try and avoid the guidance  given
    in SS (Congo) and other case law.

18.  For these reasons I am satisfied that the ECO's  decision  was  on  the
    face of it correct but more importantly that  the  Original  Tribunal's
    decision on the matter erred in law.  The question therefore is what is
    to be done with the appeal.  Is it worthwhile going through  trying  to
    remake this decision when the answer may be  that  it  fails  but  more
    importantly the time lost and costs will be better used in making an up-
    to-date application.

19.  Accordingly I was satisfied the  Original  Tribunal's  decision  cannot
    stand and the matter will have to be remade.  Having heard the parties'
    submissions I am satisfied that it can properly be made by  me  on  the
    documentary  evidence  which  was  provided  and  in  relation  to  the
    application under Appendix FM.

20.  In the light of the evidence and facts which the judge found about  the
    Sponsor's bank statement and in the light of the submissions that  have
    been made to me concerning the relationship to the payslips I find that
    there is no purpose served in having a resumed hearing of the evidence.
    I put this point to the parties: It was appropriate to remake the  case
    on the basis of the evidence provided to the ECO.

21.  It is most unfortunate that  this  matter  has  taken  so  long  to  be
    resolved because it has been clear that the requirements of Appendix FM-
    SE in relation to specified evidence could not be met as required under
    the Rules. Had a different  application  been  made,  submitting  other
    evidence and  making  submissions  on  the  absence  of  the  specified
    evidence there would at least have been a chance at that  date  of  the
    matter receiving a positive However that was not done and the  ECO  did
    not exercise any discretion. It  is  extremely  unfortunate  that  this
    should have been the outcome but it is a consequence of the  intentions
    of the Rules and in particular Appendix FM-SE as drafted.

DECISION
22.  Accordingly, I find the only outcome is that the following decision  is
    substituted the decision of the Original Tribunal can not stand.

23        The appeals of the Claimants are dismissed.

24.  An anonymity order was previously made and should be continued.
