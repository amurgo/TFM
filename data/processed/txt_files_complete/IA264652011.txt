Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Bassiri-Dezfouli
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Ghana (born 11th July 1964). This is  the
    Respondent's appeal against the decision of a First-tier Tribunal Judge
    allowing the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse her application for permanent residence in the United Kingdom as
    the former spouse of  an  EEA  national;  and  to  revoke  her  current
    Residence Card valid up to December 2014.

 2. Although this is the Respondent's appeal, for the sake  of  clarity,  I
    refer to Ophelia Kena-Amoah as the Appellant and the Secretary of State
    as the Respondent.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  under
    the EEA Regulations but allowed it under Article 8 ECHR (Private Life).

Background

 4. The Appellant entered the United Kingdom in February 2001. By  her  own
    account she entered on a six month visa. In 2002 she met her husband Mr
    Dunker, who was in the United Kingdom employed as a motor mechanic.  In
    March 2003 she and Mr  Dunker  married.  As  he  was  a  Dutch  citizen
    exercising Treaty rights in the UK, she applied for and was  granted  a
    Residence Card in August 2003.

 5. In 2008 the Appellant sought to renew the Residence Card  and  she  was
    granted a further Residence Card valid until December 2014.

 6. However it is clear that things were not  as  straightforward  as  they
    appeared. She and Mr Dunker  divorced  in  November  2008,  the  decree
    absolute being granted on 6th March 2009. In  May  2011  the  Appellant
    made application for permanent  residence  on  the  basis  of  retained
    rights as the former spouse of an EEA national.  This  application  was
    refused and in addition following enquiry,  the  Appellant's  Residence
    Card which was valid until 2014 was revoked. It was revoked because the
    Respondent did not accept that the payslips  which  had  been  produced
    showing the Appellant's former  spouse  as  working  were  genuine.  In
    addition the Appellant did not inform the  Respondent  of  her  divorce
    from the EEA  national,  until  2011  when  she  made  application  for
    permanent residence.

 7. The Appellant appealed those  decisions.  Her  appeals  under  the  EEA
    Regulations were dismissed  but  allowed  on  Article  8  human  rights
    grounds.

 8. In summary  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found  that  he  was  not
    satisfied that the pay slips submitted by the Appellant in  respect  of
    her  former  spouse  were  genuine,  nor  was  he  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant's former  husband  had  been  working  at  the  time  of  the
    termination of the marriage, as well as not being  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant's former husband was working in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    continuous period of five  years.  For  those  reasons  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  found  that  the  Appellant's   Residence   Card   was
    appropriately revoked and that the application for permanent  residence
    was correctly refused by the Respondent. I have outlined those findings
    because I shall refer to them later in this determination.

 9. Having made those decisions, the First-tier Tribunal Judge then went on
    to look at any Article 8 claim that the  Appellant  might  have.  After
    summarising the Appellant's work history, her length  of  stay  in  the
    United Kingdom, her relationships and whether private life could be re-
    established elsewhere, the Judge concluded that the Appellant's removal
    would be disproportionate to the need of proper immigration control. He
    therefore allowed the appeal under Article 8.

10. The Respondent appealed that decision. It is noted here that there  was
    no cross-appeal from the Appellant on the Judge's decision  to  dismiss
    her appeals under the EEA Regulations. Permission to appeal was granted
    and DJ Coates having heard argument from  both  parties  concluded  the
    following,

         "Judge Taylor found that the  Appellant  had  reached  a  level  of
         income and integration in the United Kingdom over a ten year period
         which she would not be able to replicate on return to Ghana.  I  am
         satisfied that this finding is speculative and no reasons have been
         given to substantiate it, given the fact that the Appellant is a 47
         year old Ghanaian citizen who spent the majority  of  her  life  in
         that country. The Judge has also not explained  why  the  Appellant
         would not be able to use the skills and  experience  which  he  has
         gained in the United Kingdom to her own advantage upon return.

         I am  satisfied  that  no  consideration  has  been  given  in  the
         balancing exercise to the public interest in maintaining  effective
         immigration control...The Judge has rightly referred to the  Razgar
         guides but has not explained adequately why the Appellant's removal
         would be  disproportionate  to  the  need  for  proper  immigration
         control.

         For these reasons  I  find  that  the  Judge's  reasoning  for  the
         decision to allow the appeal under Article 8  is  flawed  and  that
         this amounts to a material error of law such that the determination
         falls to be set aside".

    Thus the matter comes before me as a  resumed  hearing  on  whether  it
    would  be  disproportionate  under  Article  8  ECHR,  to  require  the
    Appellant to return to Ghana.

The Hearing

11. At the hearing before me Miss Bassiri-Dezfouli appeared  on  behalf  of
    the Appellant and Mr Avery on behalf of the Respondent. I confirm  that
    I had before me the original documents which were sent under  cover  of
    Pan-African Legal  Advisory  Services  letter  of  21st  February  2012
    together with further supporting documents sent on 3rd May 2013 by  the
    Appellant. Those  documents  included  a  witness  statement  from  the
    Appellant together with various  letters  of  support  and  importantly
    copies of the Appellant's wage slips for her  employment  at  Hammerson
    Memorial Home and letters from the deputy manager and  matron  of  that
    establishment.

12. The Appellant gave oral evidence before me. Her sister Agnes, her  twin
    sister Olivia, Mrs Donkor (Pastor Donkor's wife) and Ebenezer Yaw Debra-
    Frimpong also attended the hearing and gave oral evidence.

13. The Appellant Ophelia Kena-Amoah told me that she lives at 52 Chingford
    Road Walthamstow London EC17 4PJ. She referred to a  witness  statement
    signed and dated 21st May 2013 and confirmed that she  wished  to  rely
    upon that witness statement as her  evidence-in-chief.  In  summary  it
    sets out that she is a qualified senior healthcare assistant working at
    the Lewis W Hammerson  Memorial  Home.  This  is  a  home  for  elderly
    resident, and her duties include working with those  residentswho  have
    limited mobility, dressing  and  undressing  them,  helping  them  with
    toilet and personal hygiene matter.

14. The Appellant has worked her way up from care assistant to senior  care
    assistant and it took her five years to reach that  position.  She  has
    various certificates to show her expertise.

15. In addition to her employment, the Appellant is a member of her  church
    and she has bought a property at 52 Chingford Road Walthamstow. She has
    bought this property together with her sister Olivia  and  there  is  a
    mortgage on the property.

16. The Appellant reports that she has been in the United Kingdom  now  for
    twelve years and has worked for the same employer for  the  last  eight
    years.

17. She is clearly well thought of having obtained promotion  in  the  five
    years she has worked at this particular home.

18. She told me that she could not obtain any similar employment to this in
    Ghana. Her certificates would not be applicable there and in additional
    from enquiries she has made, there is not residential care in Ghana  in
    the same way as in the UK. Any similar work opportunities  are  limited
    and generally work is given to younger people.

19. She said that although she accepted she has spent the majority  of  her
    life in Ghana, she would be devastated to leave the UK. She  will  have
    no work and although her parents live in Ghana they  are  divorced  and
    she is  responsible  for  their  financial  maintenance.  If  she  were
    returned there she does not  know  how  she  would  maintain  them  nor
    herself.

20. She emphasised that she is purchasing a property in  the  UK,  together
    with her sister Olivia. There is a mortgage of ï¿½180,000 on the property
    (interest only) I gained the impression that her sister would be unable
    to fund the mortgage on her own  if  the  Appellant  were  returned  to
    Ghana. That concluded her evidence.

21.  I next heard from Agnes Kena-Amoah. Agnes Kena-Amoah told me that  she
    is Ophelia's sister. She reported that she has three  children  one  of
    whom is in Cyprus and two of whom are in the United Kingdom. She relied
    upon a letter that she had submitted dated 1st May 2013. In addition to
    that letter she said  that  her  sister  Ophelia  is  the  one  who  is
    responsible for supporting their parents in Ghana. No one else is  able
    to support them financially.

22. Her sister Ophelia helps her with  shopping  and  cooking  because  she
    suffers from a prolapsed disk in her back.

23. In answer to Mr Avery she said that her son is in Cyprus with a friend.
    Another child is working and another is redundant but  lives  at  home.
    She does not see their sister Olivia in the  same  way  that  she  sees
    Ophelia. This is because Olivia is working  and  when  she  comes  home
    wants to spend time with her husband, rather than looking after her.

24. I then heard briefly from Olivia  Kena-Amoah  she  confirmed  that  she
    lives at 52 Chingford Road which she said is a flat that  she  and  her
    sister Ophelia have purchased together. She confirmed  that  she  could
    not help her parents financially because has children in university  in
    Ghana.

25. She was asked by Mr Avery to confirm how she knew that there  would  be
    no possibility of employment for Ophelia in Ghana, in the same type  of
    work that she is doing in the United Kingdom. She replied that she  has
    a friend and was discussing this with her friend and was informed  that
    there are simply not the same sort of care homes in Ghana as there  are
    in the United Kingdom.

26. Olivia confirmed that she works in the same place  as  her  sister  but
    that she works shift work. She said there is no time for her  to  spend
    at home and her children are at university in Ghana as they were  never
    brought to the United Kingdom.

27. I next heard from Mrs Donkor who is the wife of Pastor Donkor,  of  the
    King's Temple. She told me that the Appellant is a church member and  a
    very active one. She said that  she  helps  out  greatly,  by  visiting
    people when there is a need and giving help  and  support  when  called
    upon. In addition she is a member of the choir attends  Sunday  worship
    services and special events. She carries out these  duties  voluntarily
    and  receives  no  remuneration.  Mrs  Donkor  confirmed  that  if  the
    Appellant were to be returned  to  Ghana,  it  would  be  difficult  to
    replace her  because  of  the  help  which  she  gives  to  the  church
    community.

28. Finally I heard from Ebenezer Debra-Frimpong. He told me that he  lives
    at 114 Sweets Way London N20 0NT. He confirmed that  he  is  originally
    from  Ghana  and  that  he  knows  the  Appellant  through  her  church
    membership. He told me that he has a brother who is a doctor  in  Ghana
    and he had enquired of his brother the  possibility  of  the  Appellant
    being able to access similar work in Ghana to that which  she  does  in
    the United Kingdom. He said that he was informed that  in  Ghana  there
    are no Homes or Home Carers. It is the immediate family who looks after
    people and what his brother reports is that it would be  difficult  for
    the Appellant to obtain employment - she is 49 years of  age  and  most
    employment is taken up by younger people. That concluded his evidence.

29.  I confirm that I have also taken into account the character references
    submitted in support of the Appellant.

Assessment of Evidence and My Findings

30. Both representatives agree that what was before me  was  an  Article  8
    claim. I keep in mind the questions posed  in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27
    since essentially the question before me is  whether  any  interference
    with  this  Appellant's  Article  8  rights,  could  be  deemed  to  be
    proportionate to the interests in a  democratic  society,  of  national
    security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of  the  country  for
    the prevention of disorder or crime the protection of health or  morals
    or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

31. Proportionality involves the need to balance the interests  of  society
    with those of individuals or groups and brings in the concept of a fair
    balance between the rights of the individual in the  interests  of  the
    community.

32. In this Appellant's case I accept that  what  is  against  her  is  the
    unchallenged   finding   from   the   First-tier    Tribunal    Judge's
    determination, that the Appellant, from 2008  remained  in  the  United
    Kingdom without leave and that she failed to notify the authorities  of
    her divorce from her husband.

33. Balanced against that  however  I  accept  that  she  was  lawfully  in
    possession of a Residence Card from 2003 to 2008 and that  she  had  an
    expectation at that time that her future life would be conducted in the
    United Kingdom.

34. I accept that the United Kingdom has a right to control migration,  but
    balanced against this the Appellant has been in country now for  twelve
    years and has integrated well here.

35. She is in employment, pays her taxes and cannot be said to be a  burden
    on the United Kingdom. She is buying her property with a  mortgage  and
    from the evidence before me there is no suggestion  that  the  mortgage
    repayments are not up-to-date.

36. Her employment is one which provides a valuable service to  elderly  UK
    residents and she has gained promotion in that employment.

37. I also take into account that she is someone who works voluntary  as  a
    helper in her church and to a lesser extent  her  help  to  her  sister
    Agnes.

38. I accept that there is  a  contention  from  the  Respondent  that  the
    Appellant can return  to  Ghana  and  use  her  skills  there  to  gain
    employment. Balanced against that, I am  satisfied  that,  although  he
    could be said to partisan witness, the  evidence  of  Mr  Ebenezer  Yaw
    Debra-Frimpong, came across  as  credible.  He  informed  me  that  his
    brother is a doctor in Ghana and from his enquiries, there would not be
    the opportunity for the Appellant to engage in any similar  employment.
    I also take into account that the Appellant told me that any employment
    goes to younger people and I see no reason to disregard that  evidence.
    I am therefore satisfied that the Appellant would not  find  employment
    of a similar nature in Ghana and that factor also has to be weighed  in
    the balance.

39. Weighing all factors into the balance and accepting  that  matters  are
    finely balanced, nevertheless in my judgement when I look  at  all  the
    matters, those against and for the Appellant, I find in her  favour.  I
    am therefore satisfied on the evidence before  me,  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate to this Appellant's Article 8 rights, to return her to
    Ghana.



DECISION

40. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained an error of law
    such that the decision had  to  be  set  aside.  I  hereby  remake  the
    decision. The appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made
