Representation:
For the Appellant:          Miss Imamovic of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The Respondent refused the Appellants'  applications  for  leave  to
       enter as a spouse and dependent children on 1  September  2015.  The
       appeal against that  was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Sangha ("the Judge") following a hearing on 28 October 2016.

    2. Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam granted permission to appeal (11  May
       2017). She said it is arguable that the Judge erred in concluding at
       [22] that the Appellant cannot meet the substantive requirements  of
       the rules, and that this infected  the  article  8  assessment  even
       though it was accepted  that  she  could  not  meet  the  evidential
       requirements.

    3. It is of note that the key issue related to the Sponsor's employment
       at Kelly's, and what income could be relied on  from  that.  I  will
       therefore focus purely on that.

The Judgement

    4. The Judge records [10];

       "With regard to the letter from Kelly's at page 27 (a) Miss Imamovic
       agreed that it did not contain all the details  required  under  the
       Rules but submitted that I could  rely  on  other  evidence  in  the
       Appellants bundle to satisfy that the Appellants met  the  financial
       threshold.

       [20] I have been provided with a letter from Kelly's News  dated  15
       October 2015 which confirms that  the  Sponsor's  annual  salary  is
       �6,552 gross and that he started work there on 1 March 2014 and that
       he was paid his salary from 15 March 2014 and that he is employed by
       them as a  sales  assistant  on  a  permanent  part  time  basis.  I
       satisfied that the letter meets the requirements of the Rules..."

       [25] The HMRC tax calculation for  the  tax  year  2014/15...clearly
       shows that  for  that  period  the  Sponsor's  total  earnings  were
       �22,717. If that is correct that clearly shows that  the  Appellants
       do not meet the financial threshold under  the  Rules  as  they  are
       required to show a gross income of at least �24,800 per annum."

Discussion

    5. The key point, as submitted by Miss  Imamovic,  was  that  the  HMRC
       letter does not accurately reflect the income or payslips as the tax
       year date cut across the employment at  Kelly's,  and  in  fact  the
       payslips showed that his total income was �26,919 when  the  full  6
       month period was considered and not  just  the  1  month  that  fell
       within  that  particular  tax  year.  The  "concession"  was  not  a
       concession of the fact of employment or income as it is  clear  that
       it was said that other evidence filled the "gap".

    6. Mr Whitwell did not challenge Miss Imamovic's  key  point  regarding
       how the calculation was to be made.

    7. I agree with Miss Imamovic's unchallenged assessment  of  the  legal
       position. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge did materially err
       in relation to  the  income  from  Kelly's.   It  should  have  been
       considered over the full 6 months and not just the 1 month  referred
       to in the HMRC letter. The Judge therefore materially erred.

    8. Having heard submissions, I agreed that it was appropriate to rehear
       the matter. Both representatives agreed  that  I  should  allow  the
       appeal as the Kelly's income when properly assessed plainly took the
       Sponsor's income over the relevant threshold, and was  supported  by
       the appropriate specified evidence.

    9. As the Sponsor met the relevant income threshold, the rules were met
       in full. There is no legitimate aim in separating  the  family  when
       all the rules are  met.  There  could  be  adverse  consequences  in
       separating a family given the low  threshold.  It  was  therefore  a
       disproportionate interference in the respect they were  entitled  to
       with regards their family life to require them to reapply.  I  allow
       the appeal on human rights  grounds,  that  being  the  only  ground
       available to the family.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision.

    I remake the decision and allow the appeals.
