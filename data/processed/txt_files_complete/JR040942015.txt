                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara




            Application for judicial review: substantive decision


Having considered all documents lodged and having heard from Mr G �
Ceallaigh

of counsel,  instructed  by  Londonium  Solicitors  and  Ms  E  Wilsdon,  of
Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department,  on  behalf  of  the
Respondent, at a hearing at Field House, London on 7 May 2019.


Decision: the application for judicial review is granted



   Introduction


   1. These judicial review proceedings, issued on 10 April 2015, challenge
      the respondent's decision  dated  9  February  2015  to  curtail  the
      applicant's leave to remain  pursuant  to  section  10(1)(b)  of  the
      Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, on the basis of an  allegation  that
      the applicant had  used  a  proxy  test  taker.  Also  challenged  is
      correspondence from the respondent dated 4 March  2015  in  which  an
      application to reconsider that earlier decision was refused.

   Procedural history

   2. The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 October  2009  with
      leave to enter under Tier 4 (General) of the Points-based system.  He
      was granted further periods of leave to remain in the same  capacity,
      most recently from 22 May 2014 until 28 August 2015. On  10  February
      2015, the applicant was served with notice of an immigration decision
      to remove him from the United Kingdom which could  only  be  appealed
      from abroad.

   3. The pre-action protocol process was utilised.





   4. The  decision  dated  9  February  2015  stated  that  the  applicant
      submitted a certificate from Educational  Testing  Service  (ETS)  in
      relation to an English language test taken at Colwell College on   16
      May 2012  in support of an application he made for further  leave  to
      remain on 7 November 2012 and that ETS checked the test and that  his
      scores had been cancelled. Consequently, the respondent  was  of  the
      view that the applicant was liable to be removed under Section 10  of
      the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 as a person who used deception in
      seeking leave to remain.

   5. The grounds of challenge were threefold.  Firstly,  the  decision  to
      remove the  applicant  was  unlawful  because  there  was  inadequate
      evidence of deception and an out of country appeal was  insufficient.
      Secondly, Article 5 ECHR was  raised  in  relation  to  the  proposed
      removal of the applicant. Thirdly, it was argued that the  respondent
      unlawfully delegated power to ETS in order to determine that  he  had
      practised deception.

   6. Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Mehmood  &  Shahbaz
      Ali V SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ  744,  an  Upper  Tribunal  lawyer  made
      directions, for the applicant to lodge amended grounds within 7  days
      of 18 September 2015, failing which his claim would be struck out. No
      amended grounds were  received.  The  claim  was  struck  out  on  30
      September 2015.

   7. On 2 November 2015, the applicant sought  to  reopen  his  claim  and
      amended grounds were filed. Those grounds primarily argued  that  the
      applicant had not been given the opportunity to make  representations
      on Article 8 ECHR.

   8. Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds granted the  applications  to  reopen  the
      claim and file amended grounds but  refused  permission  on  8  March
      2016. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Craig  refused  permission  at  an  oral
      renewal hearing on 6 May  2016.  The  applicant  subsequently  sought
      leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

   9. The applicant's Court of Appeal challenge  ended  by  consent  on  26
      November 2018, with it being ordered by Master Bancroft-Rimmer,  that
      his application for permission for judicial  review  be  granted  and
      that the case be remitted to the Upper  Tribunal  for  a  substantive
      hearing.

  10. Detailed grounds of defence were filed on 2 April 2019, in  which  it
      was argued that other than the applicant's contention that he did not
      use deception, his pleaded grounds were academic. The respondent  did
      not contend that an out of country appeal amounted to an  alternative
      remedy that operated as a bar to the claim. The issue for  the  Upper
      Tribunal was whether  the  applicant  obtained  his  English-language
      certificate fraudulently. The Secretary of State  indicated  that  he
      would make appropriate submissions once the evidence adduced  by  the
      parties was heard and tested by cross-examination.

  11. In advance of the hearing the applicant provided trial bundles  which
      included two witness statements for the applicant dated 4 April  2015
      and 14 February 2017. The content  of  those  witness  statements  is
      summarised below.













  12. The first statement says that the applicant began his studies in  the
      United Kingdom on 26 August 2009 at Transatlantic  College  where  he
      studied for  a  diploma  in  management,  however  the  course  ended
      prematurely when the college was shut down. The applicant sought  the
      Secretary of State's permission to enrol at London Trinity College to
      read accountancy. His leave was extended until December 2013 for  him
      to do so. London Trinity College closed down during August  2011.  On
      16 May 2012, the applicant sat TOEIC  examinations  in  speaking  and
      writing at Colwell College.

  13. During June 2012 the applicant received a (60-day) letter  curtailing
      his previous leave which was granted  for  him  to  study  at  London
      Trinity College. He required the said letter in order to obtain a new
      educational sponsor. The  applicant  applied  for  further  leave  to
      remain to study business  management  at  West  End  College  London,
      however this institution was also closed down by  the  respondent  in
      July 2012. The applicant was subsequently issued with a further  '60-
      day' letter enabling him to obtain a new Confirmation  of  Acceptance
      for Studies (CAS).

  14. On 7 November 2012, the applicant gained admission  to  London  Regal
      College on a strategic management course and submitted a CAS  to  the
      respondent along with the TOEIC certificate. The Secretary  of  State
      granted the applicant leave to remain to enable him to complete  this
      course, which he did in April 2014.

  15. Thereafter, the applicant enrolled on an MSc in Travel and Tourism at
      Sunderland University and his leave  was  extended  until  28  August
      2015. After his leave to remain was curtailed owing to the allegation
      that he had used deception in a TOEIC examination, the applicant  was
      unable to complete the modules for his master's degree. The applicant
      contended that he sat the TOEIC examination in person, that he had  a
      sound knowledge of English, a strong academic record in  English,  he
      had been taught in English throughout his education including for the
      degree he gained in Bangladesh. The applicant spoke  of  the  extreme
      effects of the decision to curtail  his  leave,  which  included  the
      termination of  his  career  hopes  upon  which  he  had  spent  many
      thousands of pounds.

  16. In the second witness statement,  the  applicant  expanded  upon  his
      education in Bangladesh which he undertook in English from the age of
      four and until he graduated with a First-Class degree in Anthropology
      from  the  Shahjalal  University  of  Science  and  Technology.   The
      applicant addressed his immigration and educational  history  in  the
      United Kingdom in a similar manner to  the  first  witness  statement
      which is not repeated here. From [10] onwards the applicant addressed
      the  respondent's  allegation,  which  he  categorically  denied  and
      provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which he took his
      TOIEC examinations.

  17. The applicant describes in some detail the nature of the TEOIC  tests
      in listening and reading which he took on 23  April  2012  at  London
      School of Management and Development Studies as well as the  speaking
      and writing tests at Colwell College, which  he  described  as  being
      situated near Aldgate East station. The applicant explains  that  the
      former School had its licence suspended or revoked, and this  is  why
      he had to complete the TOEIC tests at Colwell College.





  18. The applicant added that he had passed some modules of  his  master's
      degree course in the United Kingdom which demonstrated that he had  a
      good grasp of English, however the University had not allowed him  to
      continue his studies. He  expressed  frustration  that  he  had  paid
      �9,000 in fees to Sunderland University for a  course  he  could  not
      complete. The applicant described himself as depressed and  explained
      that the allegation had humiliated him in the eyes of his family.  He
      added that it would be degrading for him to return to Bangladesh with
      "practically nothing" having spent a huge amount of money and time in
      the United Kingdom and that he would not be able to find a decent job
      with his current qualifications.




   THE RELEVANT LAW

  19. s10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 provided, at the  material
      time, as follows.


      10.- Removal of certain persons unlawfully in the United Kingdom.


           (1) A person who is not a British citizen may be removed from
           the United Kingdom, in accordance with directions given by an
           immigration officer, if-
           ...
           (b) he uses deception in seeking (whether successfully or not)
           leave to remain;
      ...


           (8) When a person is notified that a decision has been made to
           remove him in accordance with this section, the notification
           invalidates any leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
           previously given to him.

  20. In SM and Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229
      (IAC), the Upper Tribunal concluded:

     i) The Secretary  of  State's  generic  evidence,  combined  with  her
        evidence particular to these two appellants, sufficed to  discharge
        the evidential burden of proving that their TOEIC certificates  had
        been procured by dishonesty.

    ii) However, given the  multiple  frailties  from  which  this  generic
        evidence was considered to suffer and, in the light of the evidence
        adduced by  the  appellants,  the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to
        discharge the legal burden of proving dishonesty on their part.

  21. In MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC), the
      following observations were made on the expert evidence at [15] of
      the decision:

   (iv)    There is conflicting  evidence  about  whether  the  spoken  and
      written responses of candidates to individual questions are stored on
      individual electronic files or otherwise...

   (xi)     The  integrity  of  the  test  taking  procedures  and  systems
      established by ETS in its manuals depends heavily on the  reliability
      and  probity  of  test  centre  staff.  Further,  the  ETS   security
      precautions concentration on the elicit conduct of candidates and not
      test centre employees.


   (xii)With the sole exception of audio files, all of the  computer  files
      produced have been in the form of " print-out to PDF": the effect  of
      this " ... has been not to preserve any original date -  and  -  time
      stamps or internal  metadata  either  or  both  of  which  would  have
      assisted analysis using digital forensic analysis and helped produce a
      chronology of events".






      (xiv) A study of the spreadsheets attached to the  witness  statements
      of the Home Office employee, Mr Sewell reveals a  lack  of  any  nexus
      between the data  supplied  to  him  by  ETS  and  the  unique  ID  of
      individual candidates. As a result, the experts say


           " We do not know the processes by which the candidate's name is
           linked to each test".


      (xv)  The experts acknowledge  the  documentary  evidence  of  "simple
      impersonation", with    particular reference to  the  unannounced  ETS
      audit at Synergy College on 16 January 2013. They express the  opinion
      that the simple impersonation mechanism would be "vulnerable"  in  any
      speaking tests.


      (xvi) While there is also some evidence of "dictated  answers",  "viz"
      answers to test  questions  being  called  out  by  a  person  in  the
      examination room, this method would  not  be  viable  for  the  spoken
      English test.


      (xvii)       The  investigation  of  a  particular  test   centre   in
      Birmingham established  the  use  of  the  "remote  control  software"
      mechanism by the use of "Team Viewer" software whereby a person  using
      another computer could secure access to the computer being used by the
      candidate. The possibility of other, covert, remote control mechanisms
      is acknowledged.

      (xix) Yet another mechanism, entailing a simultaneous testing  session
      using proxies in a "hidden room" at the test centre or elsewhere  is
      acknowledged.


      (xx)   According  to  the  experts,  " particular  opportunities  for
      mistakes appear to arise if the actual registration on the ETS  system
      is sometimes  carried  out  by  test  centre  staff  and  not  by  the
      candidates themselves", creating the risk of the data provided by  the
      test centre to ETS mis-matching the candidates and their tests.  There
      was no security precaution available to counter this  risk,  with  the
      exception of an unannounced ETS audit.


      (xxi) As none of the computers or data media associated with the  test
      centres involved in these cases is available, there is no  information
      relating to the important issues of audit, log and configuration files
      and related time and date stamps. This is one aspect giving rise  to
      the recurring lament of the experts:


      "We have been limited by the quantity and quality of material actually
available to us."


      (xxii)      The "naming conventions" for  the  digital  files  of  the
      voice recordings produced do not provide an explicit link between  the
      candidate and the recording: rather, there is only  reference  to  the
      particular test being taken. Contrary to a suggestion  emanating  from
      ETS  via  their  solicitors,  the  file  name  does not include  the
      candidate's "unique registration code". Thus:


           "... What this naming system does is to provide linkage  between
           a registered candidate  and  the  responses  and  recording  but
           assumes that the unique registration code is reliably linked  to
           the real candidate. As we have already pointed out, in  the  two
           spreadsheets exhibited by  Adam  Sewell  there  are  no  columns
           uniquely to identify candidates by  reference  to  the  ID  they
           originally tendered (e.g. the passport number)."


      (xxiii)     " The experts have examined the supplied audio files  and
      find that there is no  embedded  metadata  which  might  assist  their
      enquiries. Time and date stamps  appear  to  be  of  the  most  recent
      copying of the file and not of the point of origination".


  22. The correct approach to determining whether a person engaged in TOEIC
      fraud was set out in Majumder v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 1167:

      "...in considering an allegation of dishonesty the  relevant  factors
      included the following: what the person  accused  had  to  gain  from
      being dishonest; what he  had  to  lose;  what  is  known  about  his
      character; the cultural environment in which  he  operated;  how  the
      individual accused of dishonesty performed  under  cross-examination,
      and whether  the  Tribunal's  assessment  of  that  person's  English
      language proficiency is commensurate with his or  her  TOEIC  scores;
      and whether his or her academic achievements are  such  that  it  was
      unnecessary or illogical for them to have cheated."




The hearing

  23. Mr � Ceallaigh referred to an application  made  on  3  May  2019  to
      extend the time to file the applicant's skeleton argument  by  3  May
      2019. Time was extended as requested. Similarly,  time  was  extended
      for the respondent's skeleton argument to be filed by 7 May 2019.

  24. Both representatives were in agreement as to  the  relevant  law  and
      that the hearing would concern solely whether or  not  the  applicant
      had used deception in taking his English  language  test  at  Colwell
      College on 12 May 2012.

  25. I permitted Mr � Ceallaigh to submit a report  of  Georgia  Costa,  a
      psychologist who saw the applicant on 25 April 2019.  He stated  that
      this report was relevant to how the Tribunal assessed the applicant's
      evidence. In addition, the applicant was fasting for Ramadan  and  he
      apologised for  the  weakness  of  his  voice  at  the  beginning  of
      examination-in-chief.

  26. The content of the applicant's oral evidence was in line with that of
      his witness statements and I will therefore only  summarise  any  new
      evidence which emerged.

  27. During examination-in-chief the applicant clarified that he also took
      and failed the speaking and writing tests he sat at the London School
      of Management and Development Studies on 23 April 2012 and needed  to
      retake them. When asked about the ETS SELT Source Data, showing  that
      he had also taken three tests at New College of Finance on  18  April
      2012, he denied that he had attended that institution or taken  tests
      there.

  28. In response to questions posed in  cross-examination,  the  applicant
      explained that his initial career goals had changed amid the constant
      closure of his Tier 4 sponsors. In the end, he had decided to  pursue
      a career in travel  and  tourism  which  was  why  he  commenced  the
      master's degree at Sunderland University.

  29. The applicant clarified that the reference to East End College in the
      second witness statement was incorrect and that he attended West  End
      College. In relation to the  tests  taken  at  Colwell  College,  the
      applicant explained that he had paid for the tests in  cash  and  had
      not received any communications from the College. He had retained  no
      documentary evidence in relation to Colwell  College.  The  applicant
      explained that he had not contacted Colwell College after  his  leave
      was curtailed because he was aware that  the  College  had  had  its'
      licence revoked and it had closed down.

  30. When asked by Ms Wilsdon why he had not contacted ETS, the  applicant
      explained that his solicitors  had  obtained  a  copy  of  the  voice
      recording linked to his test. The applicant accepted that it was  not
      his voice on the recording. He explained that he had no witnesses  to
      his claim that he took the test in person  because  he  attended  the
      test alone. Ms Wilsdon put the allegation of  deception  directly  to
      the applicant, which he robustly denied.

Submissions

  31. Ms Wilsdon relied on her skeleton argument as  well  as  the  Project
      Fa�ade report on Colwell College, Leicester dated 15 May 2015.    She
      emphasised that 53% of tests results were invalid  and  most  of  the
      remainder were questionable. The audit into  Colwell  College  showed
      widespread abuse including the invigilator being kept out of the room
      when tests were taken.







  32. Ms Wilsdon argued that the respondent had raised sufficient  evidence
      to discharge the initial burden and that the applicant had  given  no
      particular explanation other than a straight denial.  She  emphasised
      that  the  applicant  had  provided  no  evidence  to   support   his
      explanation in the form of a witness, evidence of booking the test or
      his travel history. Furthermore, the  applicant  admitted  the  voice
      recording was not his.  She  contended  that  it  was  unlikely  that
      someone else's recording was linked to the applicant.

  33. Referring to the applicant's education history and qualifications, Ms
      Wilsdon submitted that there  could  be  all  kinds  of  reasons  for
      cheating, only one of which was lack of confidence in English.

  34. Ms Wilsdon contended that the applicant had not provided any  samples
      of his work from the past to show the level at which he  was  working
      in English or from others who knew him at the time. She  argued  that
      the applicant had said that he failed  two  elements  previously  and
      that he chose  the  TOEIC  qualification  as  he  wanted  an  English
      language certificate within 60 days. That  the  applicant  was  under
      pressure of time after he failed the  first  time  amounted  to  real
      motivation for carrying out fraud.  She considered it  relevant  that
      the applicant's educational history did not show clear objectives  in
      that he had changed from business to accountancy  and  then  back  to
      business. She argued that it was no coincidence  that  the  applicant
      had attended a series of colleges which had had licences revoked.  Ms
      Wilsdon was of the opinion that the  applicant  was  not  "completely
      fluent" in English and she concluded her  submissions  by  contending
      that  his  evidence  was  insufficient  to  demonstrate  an  innocent
      explanation.

  35. During his submissions, Mr � Ceallaigh asked me to  accept  that  the
      applicant's  evidence  was  coherent  and  credible   and   that   no
      discrepancies  had  emerged   despite   extensive,   careful   cross-
      examination. He accepted  that  there  was  probably  some  fraud  at
      Colwell College given the suggestion of the use  of  pilots  and  the
      level of invalid tests. Nonetheless, he argued that it was clear from
      MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC) that there was
      no way of knowing how a voice file was connected  to  the  test,   no
      reliable evidence regarding the chain of evidence,  no  metadata  and
      that the wrong voice file attached was not an  indication  of  fraud.
      With reference to MA, Mr � Ceallaigh listed the  number  of  ways  in
      which a  different  voice  file  might  have  been  attached  to  the
      applicant's  test  such  as   the   use   of   Teamviewer   software,
      impersonation, a hidden room for pilots, the copying of  voice  files
      used  for  everyone  present  whether  cheating  or  not.  That   the
      applicant's test result was invalid did not indicate that he cheated.
      Colwell College was a large institution with two campuses, and it was
      fanciful that everyone was cheating or that the  College  would  turn
      away genuine students. The applicant  had  never  heard  of  the  New
      College of Finance until the day of the hearing and had no reason  to
      lie about that, whereas the Secretary of State said the look-up  tool
      was reliable. At this stage, Ms Wilsdon interjected to indicate  that
      the respondent was relying only on deception in relation  to  Colwell
      College which was the sole institution referred to  in  the  decision
      letter.











  36. Mr � Ceallaigh made the point  that  the  applicant  would  not  have
      needed to be resitting tests if he was cheating. Whereas it  probably
      would have been helpful if the applicant adduced  more  evidence,  it
      was not likely that he could  have  called  someone  who  could  have
      recalled that he attended  a  test  seven  years  ago.  It  would  be
      surprising if the applicant had kept  records  however,  even  if  he
      cheated it was likely that he would have receipts or tickets  at  the
      time.  He submitted that the applicant's English was very good and of
      a level which indicated that he did not need to cheat. It was to  his
      credit that he had volunteered  his  previous  failure  to  pass  the
      speaking and writing test  which  otherwise  would  be  unknown.  The
      applicant's IELTS result from 2014 (5.5 in speaking)  was  consistent
      with the applicant's level of English at the hearing.

  37. In relation to motivation to cheat, Mr � Ceallaigh  argued  that  the
      applicant only needed to re-take the speaking and  writing  test  and
      thus the time pressure was not great. Furthermore, there was  nothing
      suspicious in the applicant switching courses in the context  of  the
      multiple college closures between 2009 and 2013. He  emphasised  that
      the applicant was a genuine student who was a graduate  in  his  home
      country and who  had  commenced  a  master's  degree  in  the  United
      Kingdom. He concluded by submitting that the applicant had  raised  a
      plausible explanation.

  38. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Discussion

  39. Counsel were in agreement that the sole issue before the Tribunal  is
      whether or not the respondent can prove that the  applicant  obtained
      leave to remain by deception, specifically that he obtained his TOEIC
      test certificate by the use of a proxy.

  40. It is not in dispute that the respondent met the  initial  evidential
      burden of raising a case that requires the applicant  to  provide  an
      innocent explanation. Indeed, the applicant obtained  the  recordings
      and confirmed that it is not  his  voice  which  was  captured.  This
      raises a prima facie case of fraud.

  41. I have also considered the Project  Fa�ade  report  provided  by  the
      respondent and which is dated 15 May  2015.  The  report  concerns  a
      criminal inquiry into Colwell College, Leicester.  At  this  point  I
      note that the applicant states that he took his test  in  London  and
      not Leicester and that Mr � Ceallaigh  referred  to  Colwell  College
      having two campuses. In any event, the report  notes  that  all  test
      results were withdrawn as either invalid or questionable  which  were
      taken between 18 October 2011 and 15 January 2013. The applicant took
      his  test  between  those  dates,  albeit  not  in   Leicester.    By
      comparison, the level of invalid or questionable tests at public test
      centres was  less  than  one  per  cent.  A  number  of  issues  were
      identified during the audits of Colwell College, Leicester  including
      that the ETS employed invigilator was kept out of the test  room  and
      five pilots were identified in the telephone contact list of  one  of
      the test centre directors. While the  report  refers  to  an  ongoing
      criminal inquiry, there was no evidence before me as to the  progress
      or outcome of that investigation. Despite the foregoing  issues  with
      this evidence, I have placed some weight upon the report.

  42. The issues  with  the  evidence  identified  by  Ms  Wilsdon  in  her
      submissions did not undermine  the  applicant's  case.  The  test  in
      question was taken seven years ago and the applicant was  unaware  of
      the respondent's  concerns  for  a  further  three  years.  In  these
      circumstances the  lack  of  a  witness,  transcripts,  receipts  and
      tickets is not remotely surprising.




  43. It is the case that the applicant required  an  up  to  date  English
      language qualification in order to progress his studies and therefore
      he stood to gain a further period of study  in  the  United  Kingdom.
      Nonetheless, it could not be said that the applicant was desperate to
      pass because he was not  under  any  time  pressure  because  he  had
      already passed the listening and reading tests and was still  waiting
      for the Home Office letter granting him 60-days  leave  to  obtain  a
      CAS.

  44. As for what the applicant had to lose, paying for someone to take his
      test would  represent  a  significant  risk  to  his  reputation  and
      position in the UK. The applicant's track record  indicates  that  he
      was plainly capable of passing a spoken English  test  and  it  would
      have been wholly illogical, for him to have  cheated  when  he  could
      simply have taken the test again, as before.

  45. There is no evidence of any previous or subsequent concerns about the
      applicant's character.  He  is  a  man  of  good  character  and  has
      conducted himself impeccably since arriving in the United Kingdom and
      abided by the terms of his leave to enter and remain.

  46. I heard no submissions regarding the cultural  environment  in  which
      the applicant operated, other than perhaps  Ms  Wilsdon's  submission
      that it was no coincidence that the Tier 4  sponsors  chosen  by  the
      applicant had been closed down. It was not in dispute  that  a  great
      many sponsors had licences revoked at  the  time  the  applicant  was
      studying. There was no  evidence  produced  as  to  why  any  of  the
      applicant's  previous  colleges  were  closed  down,  let  alone  any
      indication that the applicant was implicated in that or was deserving
      of criticism for choosing those colleges at a  time  when  they  were
      licenced to sponsor overseas students.

  47.  The  applicant  performed  well  under   robust   cross-examination,
      notwithstanding that this was in circumstances where he  was  fasting
      as well as suffering mental health issues. He was able to  understand
      complex questions posed in English in cross-examination and  to  give
      detailed responses in English.

  48. The applicant was able to satisfactorily describe  the  circumstances
      in which he took the English test in question including his  thinking
      process prior to the test. Ms Georgia Costa, the psychologist who saw
      the applicant on 25 April 2019,  was  of  the  opinion  that  he  was
      suffering from Generalised Anxiety Disorder. In her detailed  report,
      she states that the applicant's  GP  previously  diagnosed  him  with
      anxiety, that he is prescribed medication and has been  referred  for
      talking therapy. Ms Costa records that the applicant told her that he
      cannot see a future for himself, that he feels "stuck," that  he  has
      become very irritable and his self-esteem has been adversely affected
      in the years since his leave was curtailed.  In addition,  he  cannot
      stop worrying about everything. Ms Costa considered the applicant  to
      be "chronically anxious."  The  applicant's  demeanour  while  giving
      evidence was not incongruous with the content of this  report.  There
      was no challenge to the  psychological  report,  upon  which  I  have
      placed a moderate degree of weight as  evidence  of  the  applicant's
      mental state at the time of the hearing. Furthermore, I consider that
      it is less likely that  the  applicant  would  be  experiencing  such
      distress for the reasons he gives if he had cheated  in  his  English
      test.  In summary, the applicant gave a clear and credible account of
      having taken the test in person during cross-examination.

  49. The applicant's standard of  English  during  his  evidence  was  not
      native-speaker standard, however there  was  no  indication  that  he
      required  an  interpreter.  His  English  language  proficiency   was
      commensurate with his TOEIC scores as well as the IELTS score he took
      just under two years later.




  50. In considering whether the applicant's academic achievements are such
      that it was unnecessary or illogical for him to have cheated, I  have
      taken into consideration that he needed to retake his spoken  English
      test. If the appellant was inclined to cheat in his TOEIC  tests,  he
      would not have needed to re-sit them. In  addition,  the  applicant's
      previous unsuccessful test was not known to the respondent and it  is
      to his credit that he volunteered this information during examination
      in chief.

  51. It is also relevant that the applicant studied English  from  a  very
      early  age  and  that  he  attained  a  degree  in  anthropology   in
      Bangladesh, in English, prior to arriving in the UK. At the time  the
      applicant took the test in issue, he had been studying in the  United
      Kingdom for close to three years and he had sat an IELTS  examination
      in March 2014, achieving 5.5 in speaking, a not dissimilar  score  to
      that  shown  in  the  TOEIC  taken  less  than  two  years   earlier.
      Notwithstanding that IELTS score, the University of Sunderland tested
      his level of English again prior to accepting  him  on  the  master's
      course in 2014 and he passed that assessment.

  52. The applicant successfully completed a  level  7  qualification  (the
      diploma in strategic management) before his leave was curtailed. Even
      after his leave was curtailed, the applicant completed  most  of  his
      MSc at the University of Sunderland. On balance, given this level  of
      achievement in the English language, notwithstanding that  he  failed
      one test, I find that  it  would  be  unnecessary  for  him  to  have
      cheated.

  53. The applicant has raised an  innocent  explanation.  His  account  is
      highly detailed, plausible, and supported by evidence of his academic
      history. Applying SM and Qadir therefore, the burden returns  to  the
      respondent to prove that he committed fraud. The respondent cannot do
      so owing to the difficulties with  the  evidence  identified  in  MA.
      Notwithstanding the applicant's concession that it is not  his  voice
      on the voice file attributed to his  test,  as  noted  from  MA,  the
      respondent has no way of  establishing  whether  a  voice  file  with
      another person's voice on it has been  correctly  attributed  to  the
      applicant's test.

  54.  Considering  the  matter  in  the  round,  the  respondent  has  not
      discharged the legal burden  of  establishing  that  the  applicant's
      innocent explanation is to be rejected.

  55. For the reasons given, the application is granted.


Costs

The respondent is to meet the  reasonable  costs  of  the  applicant  to  be
assessed if not agreed.  The  respondent  shall  pay  a  reasonable  sum  on
account within 28 days of being served a bill of costs.
