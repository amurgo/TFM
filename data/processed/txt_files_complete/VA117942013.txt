Representation:

For the Appellant:     None.
For the Respondent:    Mr R Hopkin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran born on 30th  August  1986  and  she
    appeals against the decision dated 22nd May 2013 by the  respondent  to
    refuse her a visit visa further to paragraph 41(i) and  41(ii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow heard the appeal on 30th January  2014
    and promulgated a decision on 8th April  2014  dismissing  the  appeal.
    The appellant had appealed with her aunt and uncle whose  appeals  were
    allowed.  The appellant in this instance wished to visit her cousin but
    her right of appeal was restricted, as recorded by the judge, to  human
    rights grounds under Section 84(1) (c) of the  Nationality  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was  lodged  by  the  appellant
    stating that the judgment contained an error of law.  It  was  asserted
    that the judge had  failed  to  consider  evidence  and  give  adequate
    reasons, that the judge needed to make a finding as to whether  or  not
    the relationship was 'more like brother and sister' as asserted between
    the appellant and the sponsor (they were in fact cousins), there was  a
    failure to distinguish case law.  The Tribunal cited case law in  which
    applicants wished to settle in the UK rather than  visit  for  a  short
    time and previously this case would have had a full  right  of  appeal.
    Article 8 rights can be established even where the relationship is  not
    set out in 'paragraph 12'.  In addition there was procedural unfairness
    because of the delay  between  the  appeal  hearing  and  the  decision
    making.

Grant of Permission to Appeal

 4. The application for permission to appeal was initially refused by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Reed but the application for permission  to  appeal
    was renewed by the appellant and granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Reed.



The Hearing

 5. At the hearing Mr Hopkin submitted that there was no  right  of  appeal
    and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction.

Conclusions

 6. The appellant stated in her grounds of appeal that she wished to  visit
    her cousin the sponsor, Mr Mehdi Falaboland, a British citizen, for two
    weeks.

 7. Section  88A  of  the  Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    restricts  the  right  of  appeal  according  to  the  nature  of   the
    relationship  with  the  person  being  visited.  As  recorded  in  the
    determination [11] and [14] the  Immigration  Appeal  (Family  Visitor)
    Regulations 2012, (which  restricts  the  members  of  family  who  can
    appeal), apply.   Further to Section 88A (3) a person may appeal  under
    Section 82(1)  on the grounds of Section 84(1)  (b)  and  (c)  on  race
    relations and human rights  grounds  respectively.   In  this  instance
    there is no full right of appeal for the appellant because she only the
    cousin of the sponsor.

 8. Further to Rule 9(1)A(b) of the Asylum Immigration  Tribunal  Procedure
    Rules 2005 the Tribunal  may not accept a notice of  appeal  where  the
    notice of appeal concerns the  refusal  of  an  application  for  entry
    clearance which was not made  for  a  purpose  falling  within  Section
    88A(1)(a) or (b) of 2202 Act and the notice of appeal does not rely  on
    either of the grounds specified in Section 88A(3)(a) of the  2002.   As
    stated the application was  not  made  for  a  purpose  falling  within
    Section 88(1)(a) or (b)

 9. The Form IAFT 2 (notice of appeal received by the Tribunal on 17th June
    2013 made no reference to human rights grounds. With reference  to  the
    appellant it stated

    'the third appellant has completed 123 units of the  137  she  required
    for her degree.  She has considerable reason to return.

    The 3rd Appellant works and earns around 0.5 million tomen a month  and
    her work related bank account does show a balance of  4  million  tomen
    (04/April) however she has in the region of 10 million  tomen  (ï¿½5,000)
    (30/April) on her deposit account representing monies from  her  father
    which he earns from rent and other sources.   The  sums  available  are
    sufficient for a visit)'.

10. An appellant may, however, amend the grounds of appeal further to  Rule
    14 of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal Procedure Rules 2005 (the FTT
    rules) with permission of the Tribunal.  There was no indication  prior
    to the application for permission to appeal that  there  had  been  any
    application to vary the grounds of appeal submitted. However  I  accept
    that the appeal was canvassed before the First Tier Tribunal  on  human
    rights grounds and I find this gives, by considering the matter  within
    the determination, implicit permission to the appellant to  raise  this
    ground and have it determined.  The Home  Office  was  present  at  the
    hearing and indeed argued the case.  The appeal was indeed accepted  by
    the Tribunal and set down for hearing.

11. However, the judge did not err in applying  only  case  law  for  those
    seeking to settle permanently in the  UK.   The  restrictions  and  the
    extent of Article  8  are  highlighted  in  the  judge's  determination
    through reference to European  jurisprudence  and  domestic  case  law.
    Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 accepted the approach set out in S v
    UK (1984) 40 DR 196 to the effect  that  generally  the  protection  of
    family life under Article 8 involved cohabiting dependents and  whether
    it extended to other relationship depended on the circumstances of  the
    particular case.  Relationships  between  adults  require  evidence  of
    further elements of dependency.  It was accepted in Kugathas that  this
    was not 'black letter law but this did set out the proper approach'.

12. Indeed I cannot see how it can be wrong to consider the facts  of  each
    specific case which is what the judge did in  this  case.  He  recorded
    that the appellant was a  student  living  with  her  own  parents  and
    economically dependent upon them in Iran.

13. The question arose in the application for permission to  appeal  as  to
    why cases in relation to settlement applied, implying that there should
    be some 'lesser' protected right which should be afforded consideration
    when only a short visit was  intended.   Kugathas  referred  to  ECO  v
    Shamim Box [2002] UKIAT 02212 and noted that it identified the approach
    to an Article 8 case in removal is different  from  that  in  an  entry
    clearance case but added that 'Strasbourg has never seen this to entail
    a significant difference in underlying criteria'  but as the  court  in
    Kugathas stated 'in other words family life must mean  the  same  thing
    whatever the issue'.

14. Clearly the state has a duty to respect family life but the question is
    whether family life is established and this entails a consideration  of
    elements of dependency which were 'real' or  'committed'  in  terms  of
    support in order to be  able  to  establish  family  life  albeit  that
    support does not necessarily have  to  be  economic.  As  indicated  in
    Marckx (1979) 2 EHRR the mere existence of family relationship  is  not
    sufficient to found a family life, there must be some other element and
    the existence of family life is a question of fact.

15. The judge stated at [21] that the existence of family life had not been
    established. There was no evidence that the appellant and  sponsor  had
    lived together and latterly they had lived in different countries.  The
    judge made findings on the evidence at 3(c)  to  the  effect  that  the
    appellant lived with her parents and two of her siblings.   She  had  a
    part time job and a bank account  with  a  credit  balance  of  IRR41M.
    There was no indication of any form of  financial  dependency.   Indeed
    the determination recorded that she was to be funded for the  two  week
    trip by her father.  The judge noted that the visit was only  temporary
    and addressed the issue of whether a sufficient  link  existed  between
    the appellant and the sponsor.  He recorded that the  relationship  was
    between the cousins was that they had lived apart.

16. The judge found [21] that it had not been shown that there existed ties
    of support either emotional or economic which went beyond the  ordinary
    and natural ties of  affection  that  would  accompany  a  relationship
    between cousins.  In reference to ground 1 of the challenge  the  judge
    did effectively weigh the strength of  the  relationship.  He  recorded
    that the sponsor was married.  Even in the challenge  the  evidence  is
    that the sponsor saw the appellant two years ago.

17. It is correct that the judge  did  not  refer  to  the  sponsor's  oral
    evidence and this may have been an error but in  the  circumstances  of
    this particular case I cannot  see  that  a  direct  reference  to  his
    evidence would alter this decision for these reasons.  In  his  witness
    statement he stated that he and his cousin, the second appellant,  were
    'very close' and more like 'brother  and  sister'  and  they  'grew  up
    living next door to each other, we regularly  stayed  at  each  other's
    homes and were always in each other's lives.  We are in regular contact
    and I visit her every time I go back. I saw her about two years ago and
    again four months ago'.  He confirmed that the appellant  had  lots  of
    family she would not wish to leave Iran and that her  father  earned  a
    significant rental income which was paid  directly  into  her  account.
    Clearly there was no financial dependency.

18. First this statement does not indicate any 'close ties'  of  dependency
    above  normal  emotional  ties  in  a  family.   Secondly  the  sponsor
    confirmed that he was still able to visit the appellant  in  Iran.   He
    has been a British citizen  since  at  least  2006,  the  date  of  his
    passport and has seen her twice in this time.

19. I do not accept that the judge in the specific facts of this  case  was
    in error to find that family  life  did  not  exist.   The  sponsor  is
    married and financially independent and the  appellant  is  a  student,
    lives with her parents and is  financially  dependent  on  her  father.
    They have lived apart for many years and indeed  there  was  no  record
    that they had lived for any significant period of time together.

20. The last ground of challenge  relates  to  the  length  of  time  taken
    between  the  hearing  and  the  promulgation  of  the   determination.
    Paragraph 17 of the application is not clear as it states  'it  appears
    the judge could recall the hearing and did not consider the evidence in
    full'.  This is recorded as 69 days. The evidence is  recorded  in  the
    record of proceedings to which the judge had access.   That a full note
    of the hearing does not appear in the determination does not mean  that
    the judge failed  to  consider  the  sponsor's  evidence  and  a  short
    reference is included by the judge at paragraphs  3  (d)  and  9.    In
    reading the determination as a whole prejudice to the appellant is  not
    evident.

21. I consider therefore that the Tribunal had jurisdiction  to  hear  this
    appeal and the determination of Judge Calllow contained no error of law
    which would make a material difference  and  the  determination  should
    stand.
