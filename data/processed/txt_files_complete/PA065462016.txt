Representation:

For the Appellant: Ms J Todd, of Latta & Co, solicitors
For the Respondent: Ms M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of  any  information  regarding
the proceedings which would be likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify the appellant, preserving the anonymity order made  by  the  First-
tier Tribunal.

2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge J C  Grant-Hutchison  promulgated  on  11  July  2017,  which
dismissed the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.



Background


3. The Appellant was born on 27 May 1978. He is a Palestinian  national  who
was born and lived in the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp, Saida, Lebanon.

4. The appellant arrived in the UK on 14 December 2015.  He  claimed  asylum
the next day. On 9 June 2016 the Secretary of State refused the  Appellant's
protection claim.


The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge J C Grant-Hutchison ("the Judge") dismissed  the  appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 9  October  2017
Judge E B Grant gave permission to appeal stating

      2. The grounds submit the FtTJ erred in law by making a material error
      of fact (paragraph  16)  and  failing  to  take  account  of  material
      evidence (paragraph 20).


      3. This is a case where a Palestinian  national  is  accepted  by  the
      respondent to be a Palestinian national  from  Ain  al-Hilweh  refugee
      camp in Lebanon. The issue in the appeal was whether the appellant was
      at risk from the Lebanese authorities. It is arguable  that  the  FtTJ
      has made an error of fact in paragraph 16 which may have affected  the
      credibility findings as a whole.


      4. In the interests of fairness permission to appeal is granted.

The Hearing

6. (a) For the appellant Ms Todd moved the grounds of appeal.  She  told  me
that the Judge had erred in law in two respects,  the  first  that  she  had
misunderstood the evidence and the  second  that  she  had  failed  to  take
account of background evidence. She told me that those errors  affected  the
overall credibility assessment and render the decision unsafe.

(b) Ms Todd took me to [15] & [16] of the decision. At [15] of the  decision
the Judge finds that the appellant worked in a bakery  outside  the  refugee
camp. At [16] the Judge finds that the appellant is incredible  because  the
Judge finds that the appellant rarely left the refugee camp.  Ms  Todd  told
me that that demonstrates that the Judge  misinterpreted  the  evidence  and
made a material  error  of  fact  which  coloured  the  overall  credibility
assessment.

(c) Ms Todd took me to [20] and [21]  and  told  me  that  there  the  Judge
failed to take account of the general security crackdown in 2015.  She  told
that the background materials fully  support  the  appellant's  account  and
were not properly understood by the Judge. She urged me to allow the  appeal
and set the decision aside

7. (a) For the respondent, Ms O'Brien told me that  the  decision  does  not
contain errors, material or otherwise. She adopted the terms of the rule  24
note dated 15 November 2017. She took me to [17] of the decision, where  the
Judge makes alternative findings just in case  her  findings  at  [16]  were
wrong. She told me that the decision from [17] demonstrates  that  if  there
is an error contained in [15] and [16] it is not a material error.

(b) Ms O'Brien took me to [21] where she told me that  the  Judge  correctly
analysed the objective information placed before her, and demonstrates  that
she was aware of the background, and  so  did  not  make  a  decision  in  a
vacuum.  She  told  me  that  [22]  to   [29]   show   multiple   additional
considerations of the appellant's evidence which were all factored into  the
credibility assessment.

(c) Ms O'Brien urged me to dismiss the appeal  and  allow  the  decision  to
stand.

Analysis

8. This case turned  largely  on  credibility.  The  Judge  found  that  the
appellant was neither a credible nor a reliable  witness  and  so  dismissed
his claim on all grounds.

9. At [15] the Judge is not making findings  of  fact;  at  [15]  the  Judge
summarises  the  appellant's  evidence.  At  [16]  the  Judge  analyses  the
evidence, and concludes that the appellant rarely  left  the  refugee  camp,
explaining that she reached that conclusion because  the  appellant  made  a
prior inconsistent statement.  In any event, the Judge's  finding  that  the
appellant rarely left the refugee camp was not determinative of the appeal.

10. The Judge starts 17 by saying

           Even if I am wrong....

and considers the case on the basis that the appellant  had  been  detained.
At [19] and [20] the Judge explains fully why she  rejects  the  appellant's
evidence of detention.

11. It is argued that the Judge misinterpreted  background  material  &  did
not understand that there was heightened tension in  the  summer  months  of
2015. At [20] the Judge clearly refers to the murder of a Fattah colonel  in
July 2015. At [21] the  Judge  discusses  background  materials  which  were
placed before her.

12. Between [22] and [29] the Judge considers each strand  of  evidence  and
sets out clear reasons for rejecting the appellant's  claim.  Even  if  [16]
contains an error, it cannot be a material error because  between  [17]  and
[29]  the  Judge  carefully  analyses  each  adminicle  of  evidence  before
reaching  conclusions  which  were  well  within  the  range  of  reasonable
conclusions available to the Judge.

13.   In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside)  [2013]  UKUT  85  (IAC)
the Tribunal held that the Upper Tribunal would not  normally  set  aside  a
decision of the First-tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection  of
law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised and the relevant  Country
Guidance has been taken into  account,  unless  the  conclusions  the  Judge
draws from the primary data were not reasonably open to him or her.

14. In this case, there  is  no  misdirection  in  law  &  the  fact-finding
exercise is beyond criticism.  The decision is not  tainted  by  a  material
error of law. The Judge's decision, when read as a whole, sets out  findings
that are sustainable and sufficiently detailed.

CONCLUSION

15. No errors of law have been established. The Judge's decision stands.

DECISION

16. The appeal  is  dismissed.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
promulgated on 11 July 2017 stands.
