Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss D Qureshi, instructed by Marsh & Partners
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Eban.   The  respondent  is  a
    national of Nigeria, where he was  born  on  23  January  1972.   On  3
    December 2014, the Secretary of State refused his application for leave
    to remain, made on 26 March 2012 based on 14 years  unlawful  residence
    in the United Kingdom.

 2. In a Decision dated 3 December 2014, the Secretary of State refused the
    application by giving notice of refusal of leave to enter  and  removal
    directions to China.

 3. The judge allowed the appeal under Article 8 on the basis of return  to
    China with whom the respondent had no connections.

 4. Candidly Miss Qureshi did not seek to argue the judge had not erred  in
    law.  She was correct to do so.  The reasons  letter  accompanying  the
    decision of the same date make unambiguous reference to the  respondent
    being a national of Nigeria.  His nationality is not in dispute and has
    never been.

 5. Mr Jarvis explained that the Notice of Decision  would  be  amended  to
    reflect the respondent's nationality.  We set aside  the  decision  and
    remit the matter to Judge Eban to determine the  appeal  in  accordance
    with the amended notice, taking into account Miss Qureshi's  indication
    that no further evidence is anticipated.
