Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O Ngwuocha, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Ms F Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer


The relevant provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  dealing  with  Tier  2
(General) Migrants, were first laid before Parliament  on  4  November  2008
and came into effect on 27 November 2008. The fact the UKBA list of  skilled
occupations, which is referred to in paras 69 and 82 of Appendix  A  to  the
Rules,  was not placed on UKBA's website until 28  November   i.e.  24  days
after Appendix A was laid before Parliament, together  with  the  fact  that
such a list was capable of being amended by the Secretary  of  State,  means
that reliance by the respondent on the requirements set out in para  69  was
unlawful: Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719 and R (on the application of  Alvi)  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  681  applied.
(This decision does not address the implications of the  amendment  made  to
para 69 by HC382 which came into effect on 12 August 2010.)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a citizen of Nigeria, came to the UK in  June  2008  under
the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme. Within his existing leave  he  applied
on 25 November 2009 for leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  Tier
2 is for skilled workers with a job offer to fill  gaps  in  the  UK  labour
force.

2. With his application form the appellant and his sponsor had  submitted  a
Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) whose details stated that his  sponsor  was
IKUT and Associates UK, based in Ilford, Essex, his  job  title  was  "field
immigration administrator" and his job type  was  "2419  Legal  professional
not elsewhere classified". The same CoS document gave the following  summary
of his job description:

    "To provide to the general public UK immigration information  such  as:
    provision  of  basic  immigration  information  and  legal   documents.
    Gathering  various  documentations  and  information  for   prospective
    clients as requested. Undertake a variety  of  projects  from  time  to
    time, as directed by the Immigration Adviser and/or related assignments
    to the work of the Company, Internet research and prepare presentations
    and reports to prospective clients."


3. This document also stated that he earned �24,000  for  a  35  hour  week,
calculated to be �13.18 per hour, that his job  was  at  N/SVQ  level  3  or
above and that the sponsor had met the resident labour market test.

4. On 8 February 2010 the respondent refused his application because it  was
considered he could not be awarded the requisite points under Appendix A  of
the Immigration Rules HC395 as amended dealing with Attributes. Noting  that
the salary quoted on the appellant's  CoS  for  the  given  occupation  code
(code 2419) was �34,000 for a 35 hr week, equivalent  to  �13.18  per  hour,
the respondent observed that:

     "[a]ccording to the Codes  of  Practice  occupation  code  2419,  this
    should be at least �13.73 per hour [which works out as] �24,988.60  for
    a 35 working week. As this salary is not at or above the  minimum  rate
    as published in UKBA guidance, your  employer  has  not  complied  with
    Codes of Practice and we are  unable  to  award  any  point  under  the
    sponsorship criteria. "

5. The appellant appealed arguing (1) that  the  respondent's  decision  was
not in accordance with  the  Immigration  Rules  for  the  reason  that  the
guidance referred to was not specified in the body of the Rules and was  not
in existence as at the date of the relevant change to the  Rules;  (2)  that
the respondent had been wrong to classify his  job  as  "Legal  professional
not elsewhere classified" and (3) that since publicity on the Tier 2  system
avowed that the system was "flexible" and would allow customers  to  correct
minor omissions, the  respondent  was  wrong  not  to  have  considered  she
therefore had discretion to grant his application.

6. In a determination notified on  21  April  2010  Immigration  Judge  (IJ)
Bruce expressed her sympathies for the appellant,  his  Tier  2  sponsor  as
well as with  the  UKBA  staff  "who  are  tasked  with  administering  this
labyrinthine system", but went on to dismiss the appeal. The IJ  ruled  that
the option for Tier 2 sponsors to amend applications was there  so  mistakes
could be rectified but the appellant was not  arguing  that  a  mistake  had
been made when he said he was earning �24,000 per annum for a 35 hour  week.
Further, the IJ concluded that the Rules admitted no discretion in  relation
to the levels fixed for prescribed earnings.

7. The appellant's application for permission to  appeal  sought  mainly  to
rely on and amplify (2) above. It was  argued  that  the  IJ  was  wrong  to
accept the respondent's classification of the  appellant's  job  under  Code
2419 ("Legal professionals not elsewhere classified"). The  IJ  should  have
understood that the respondent's decision, in so far as it  related  to  the
classification of his work as legal, rather  than  administrative,  involved
an exercise of discretion and that being the case, should  have  decided  to
exercise his discretion differently  (presumably  so  that  the  appellant's
level of income would not have needed to be as  high  as  it  was  for  Code
2419).  It was argued that it was "inconceivable that  a  role,  which  does
not involve any legal work or legal advice, can properly  be  classified  as
that of a legal professional". Adverting  to  the  appellant's  Ground  (1),
the  Upper Tribunal's grant of permission to appeal considered that  in  the
light of Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719 it was arguable that the IJ  was  wrong
to find the appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules  because
he did not meet the earnings levels specified in policy  guidance,  although
it could not be excluded that the guidance in this case  was  akin  to  that
found lawful in R v Secretary of State for Social Services, ex parte  Camden
LBC [1987] 1 WLR 819.

8. At the hearing we received further documents and also  heard  submissions
from both representatives. It soon became apparent to us  that  we  did  not
have sufficient information  before  us  to  determine  the  appeal  and  we
therefore directed that  the  respondent  furnish  further  information  and
submissions  with  provision   for   a   response   from   the   appellant's
representatives.

9. In the event the respondent's reply to directions was delayed due to  the
illness of Ms Saunders but was eventually  received  by  us  on  20  January
2011. We regret the delay that has ensured thereafter  in  determining  this
appeal. Shortly before we were ready to promulgate our  decision  we  became
aware of the Court of Appeal's judgment in R  (Alvi)  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  681
published  on  6  June  2011.  We  considered  whether  to  invite  specific
submissions as to the implications  of  this  case  for  our  own  case  but
decided this was unnecessary and that further delay was undesirable.

10. The respondent's reply to Tribunal Directions produced  inter  alia  the
Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes of practice  summary  table
which was valid from 15 June 2009 until 1 March  2010,  which  was  said  to
contain a list of all SOC codes used by UKBA.  In addition to identifying  a
number of relevant dates (e.g. when the relevant Immigration Rules had  been
brought into force, when the codes of practice had been first posted on  the
UKBA website) the reply made two main points:

    a. "Using the job description on the CoS as a guide and comparing it to
    job descriptions on the summary table (which contains "thousands of job
    titles"), SOC code 3520, Legal  Associate  Professionals  may  be  more
    appropriate to the role of the applicant. It is classified as a skilled
    job and the migrant's salary would be at or above the appropriate  rate
    for the job".


    b. However, where there is no direct SOC code on the list  of  all  SOC
    codes used by UKBA "a sponsor is required to select the SOC  code  that
    nearest matches the job that the applicant is to  do"...[A]  caseworker
    is not  required  to  check  whether  a  sponsor  has  noted  the  most
    appropriate SOC code on the CoS. He is only required to  check  whether
    the job indicated on the CoS, that is as summarized by the SOC code, is
    described as being skilled  on  the  summary  list  above.  It  is  the
    sponsor's duty to ensure that the correct SOC has been indicated on the
    CoS. The sponsor in this case had indicated 2419 and whether  SOC  code
    2419 is appropriate is not a matter that a caseworker  is  required  to
    consider.

11. In response the appellant's representatives stated that in  para  69  of
Appendix A of the Immigration Rules the term "job" was to be  understood  by
reference to "job tasks" as shown in the job description,  rather  than  the
job title and the term "occupation" must refer  to  relevant  job  tasks  of
associated job titles (the list which is not  exhaustive).  The  requirement
cannot, in the light of the express provisions of  para  69(a)  be  read  as
being  dependent  on  whether  the  sponsor  has  indicated   a   particular
occupational classification code. Further it could not be said that the  SOC
code of practice (containing a list of skilled occupations) was to  be  used
exclusively or primarily by the Sponsor (rather than by the caseworker).

The legal framework

12. We set out the relevant legal provisions as they were before  amendments
were made by HC382 on 22 July 2010 by HC which  took  effect  on  12  August
2010. Para 245ZF(e) of the Immigration Rules provided:

      "To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 2 Migrant under this rule,
      an applicant must meet the requirements listed below. If the applicant
      meets these requirements, leave to remain will be granted. If the
      applicant does not meet these requirements, the application will be
      refused.
      Requirements:....
      (e) If applying as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant or a Tier 2 (Intra-
      Company Transfer) Migrant, the applicant must have a minimum of 50
      points under paragraphs 59 to 84 of the Appendix A".
13. Appendix A, dealing with Attributes, requires an  applicant  to  have  a
valid certificate of sponsorship (CoS). Points are scored  by  reference  to
Table 10. Para 69 stated:
      "No points will be awarded for sponsorship unless:
      (a) the job that the Certificate of Sponsorship Checking Service entry
      records that the person is being sponsored to do appears on the United
      Kingdom Border Agency's list of skilled occupations, and
      (b) the salary (which for these purposes includes such  allowances  as
      are specified as acceptable for this purpose in guidance issued by the
      United Kingdom Border Agency)  that  the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship
      Checking Service entry records that the migrant will be paid is at  or
      above the  appropriate  rate  for  the  job,  as  stated  in  guidance
      published by the United Kingdom Border Agency.
14. Para 71 stated:
      "In order for the applicant to be awarded points for a job offer  that
      passes the resident labour market test, the Certificate of Sponsorship
      Checking Service entry must indicate that  the  Sponsor  has  met  the
      requirements of that test, as defined in  guidance  published  by  the
      United Kingdom Border Agency, in respect of the job."
15. Para 79, which deals with Prospective Earnings, stated:
      "The points awarded for prospective earnings  will  be  based  on  the
      applicant's gross annual salary  (including  such  allowances  as  are
      specified as acceptable for this purpose in  guidance  issued  by  the
      United Kingdom Border Agency) to be paid by the Sponsor,  as  recorded
      in the Certificate of Sponsorship Checking Service entry to which  the
      applicant's Certificate of Sponsorship reference number relates."
16. Also relevant is para 82 which in its relevant parts stated:
      "No points will be awarded for sponsorship unless:
      (a) (i) the job that the Certificate of Sponsorship Checking Service
      entry records that the person is being sponsored to do appears on the
      United Kingdom Border Agency's list of skilled occupations, or..."
Relevant case law
 17. It is convenient if we recite the recent summary of the two main  cases
on the PBS as set out in R(Alvi), together with our  own  brief  summary  of
the latter. In R (Alvi) Jackson LJ states:
      "35. In Pankina v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2010]
      EWCA Civ 719;  [2011]  QB  376,  the  Secretary  of  State  relied  on
      paragraph 2 of Appendix C of the  Immigration  Rules.  This  paragraph
      required that an applicant for leave to remain  and  work  in  the  UK
      should have �800 and should provide the documents specified. The  rule
      then added "and must also have had those funds for a  period  of  time
      set out in  the  guidance  specifying  specified  documents  for  that
      purpose." (Those words are not quoted  in  the  judgment  in  Pankina.
      However, they are quoted in paragraph 57 of the judgment of Mr Justice
      Burton in The Queen on the Application of the Joint  Council  for  the
      Welfare of Immigrants v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2010] EWHC 3524 (Admin).) During the period when Appendix C was  laid
      before Parliament the Secretary  of  State  published  guidance  which
      specified the documents to be provided. These were bank  and  building
      society  documents  showing  that  the   applicant   had   held   �800
      continuously for 3 months. The Court of Appeal held that an  applicant
      satisfied the requirements of Appendix C if he possessed �800  on  the
      date of his application. The additional requirement to have held  that
      money for a period of 3 months did not form part  of  the  Immigration
      Rules and was not binding.
      36. Sedley L.J., with whom Rimer and Sullivan  LJJ  agreed,  gave  the
      leading judgment. His reasoning was as follows. It can be seen from  a
      review of legislative history that the rules made by Home  Secretaries
      for regulating immigration have ceased to be policy and have  acquired
      a status akin to that of law. The provisions of the Immigration  Rules
      relied upon by the Secretary of State  in  Pankina  were  laid  before
      Parliament on 9 June 2008. The guidance document, which the  Secretary
      of  State  published  shortly  afterwards,  purported  to  impose   an
      additional requirement not mentioned in the rules, namely that the sum
      of �800 should be held for a  period  of  3  months.  That  additional
      requirement had not been subject to the process set out in  section  3
      (2) of the 1971 Act. Accordingly it could not be relied upon  to  shut
      out an applicant who otherwise satisfied the requirements of paragraph
      2 of Appendix C to the Immigration Rules.
      37. Sedley L.J. accepted that a statutory instrument may refer to  "an
      extant and accessible outside source". Thus in  the  field  of  Social
      Security a statutory instrument may fix benefits  by  reference  to  a
      directory separately published by the Secretary of State.  But  it  is
      not possible for rules  to  supplement  themselves  by  further  rules
      derived from an extraneous source. Thus there were two  objections  to
      the  additional  requirement  in  Pankina.   First   that   additional
      requirement had not been laid before Parliament for 40  days  or  made
      subject  to  the  negative  resolution   procedure.   Secondly,   that
      additional requirement could be varied at the will of the Secretary of
      State. Sedley LJ observed at paragraph 29:
      "It means that a  discrete  element  of  the  rule  is  placed  beyond
      Parliament's scrutiny and left to the unfettered judgment of the  rule
      maker."
      38. In The Queen on the Application  of  the  Joint  Council  for  the
      Welfare of Immigrants v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2010] EWHC 3524 (Admin) the Divisional Court held that limits imposed
      in May 2010 on the numbers of applicants who may enter  or  remain  in
      the UK under Tier 1 (General) or Tier 2  (General)  of  the  PBS  were
      unlawful. Sullivan LJ, with whom Burton J. agreed,  gave  the  leading
      judgment. Sullivan LJ  noted  that  the  proposed  amendments  to  the
      Immigration Rules would give  Parliament  the  power  "not  merely  to
      determine the limits for Tier 1  and  Tier  2  and  incorporate  those
      limits into the rules by cross reference to the UKBA website  and  PBS
      guidance in existence at the time, but also to be able  thereafter  to
      alter them at will by making such alterations to  the  website  and/or
      the guidance as she saw fit". Following Pankina, Sullivan LJ held that
      such a provision in the Immigration Rules would be of  no  effect.  At
      paragraph 40 Sullivan LJ said:
      "It would frustrate that statutory purpose if the Secretary  of  State
      was able to lay before Parliament a change in the rules, which said in
      effect, that the practice to be followed will be set out in  guidance,
      or be published on a website, which the Secretary of  State  would  be
      free to change from time to time at her discretion.  Far  from  giving
      effect to the statutory purpose, such a rule  would  be  a  deliberate
      evasion of the statutory purpose: an attempt to place the exercise  of
      ministerial discretion beyond the bounds of Parliamentary scrutiny  as
      required by the 1971 Act."
      39. I should also set out paragraph  43  of  Sullivan  LJ's  judgment,
      since that paragraph has been  the  subject  of  some  debate  in  the
      present appeal. At paragraph 43 Sullivan LJ said:
      "I readily accept that there  is  a  spectrum  and  that  in  enacting
      section 3 (2) Parliament did not intend that every alteration  to  the
      Secretary of State's practice, however minor should be subject to  the
      scrutiny of Parliament. It is  unnecessary  to  consider  the  precise
      point in the spectrum at which Parliamentary scrutiny is not  required
      because the quantification of the limits on the number  of  applicants
      who may be as admitted under Tier 1 and Tier 2 is, on  any  basis,  at
      the very top end of the spectrum. Alterations to the limits  of  those
      who may be permitted to enter under Tiers 1 and 2, whether the  limits
      are 6, 60, 600 or 6,000 per month or per year are precisely the  kinds
      of substantive changes that should be laid before Parliament. They are
      most certainly to be equated with UKBA's list  of  skilled  occupation
      which are very much at the other end of the spectrum."
18. In R (Alvi) itself the applicant was also challenging  a  refusal  of  a
decision made to refuse him leave to remain as a Tier 2  (General)  Migrant.
He had specified in his  application  that  the  job  for  which  he  sought
permission was as an assistant physiotherapist. The respondent  stated  that
this job title did not meet the job role that is above NVQ or  SVQ  level  3
and that "The codes of practice document at  the  time  of  the  application
stated that this job role is below N/SVQ level 3.  You  have  therefore  not
been awarded any points under certificate of  sponsorship"  (para  20).  The
applicant's grounds were that he had  satisfied  the  requirements  of  para
245ZF(e) and that  the  Secretary  of  State  could  not  lawfully  rely  on
published guidance (1) because it was not part  of  the  Immigration  Rules;
and (2) it had not been laid before Parliament for 40 days.  The  respondent
placed reliance on the fact that the List of Skilled Occupations which  UKBA
had been published on 28  November  2008  by  placing  it  on  its  website,
arguing that the applicant could not meet the requirements of para  82(a)(i)
of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules because  the  applicant's  occupation
as an Assistant Physiotherapist was not on the list.
Our assessment

19. It is convenient to refer to the appellant's three original  grounds  of
appeal albeit we bear in mind of course the (mostly helpful) submissions  we
had from both representatives both at the hearing before us and in  response
to Tribunal directions made straight after the  hearing.  Leaving  Ground  1
till last, we begin with  ground  (2),  which  concerns  the  issue  of  the
occupational  classification  of  the  appellant  under  the  SOC  Codes  of
Practice occupation code 2419, as this  has  been  the  main  focus  of  the
submissions.

Ground (2)

20. Despite the  grounds  of  appeal  taking  issue  with  the  respondent's
occupational classification of the appellant as a  "Legal  professional  not
elsewhere classified" (contending that the respondent had a choice), the  IJ
did not address that issue.  That  omission  means  that  the  determination
failed to make clear to the appellant why  his  grounds  were  rejected.  In
order for this to amount to an error of law, however, we would  need  to  be
satisfied that the choice of his occupational classification  was  a  matter
for the respondent. The appellant clearly considers it was and that  it  was
for the respondent to match the job description given by  the  appellant  to
the appropriate occupational code. The fact  that  the  respondent  has  now
accepted in response  to  Tribunal  directions  that  there  was/is  a  more
appropriate occupational code  match  for  the  appellant's  job  -Associate
legal professionals - might appear to vindicate the appellant's view.

21. We are not persuaded, however, that in terms of the requirements of  the
Immigration Rules the appellant's occupational classification was  a  matter
of choice for the respondent. The  Immigration  Rules  make  clear  that  in
order to qualify for the requisite number of points  under  Appendix  A,  an
applicant must provide a valid CoS reference number for sponsorship  in  the
sub-category of Tier  2  under  which  he  is  applying  (para  63).  A  CoS
reference number will only be considered valid if the number supplied  links
to a Certificate of  Sponsorship  Checking  Service  entry  that  names  the
applicant as the migrant and confirms that the Sponsor is sponsoring him  in
the Tier 2 category indicated by the migrant in his  application  for  leave
to remain as a Tier 2 (General Migrant) (para 66).  The  Sponsor  must  have
assigned that reference number to the migrant no more than 3  months  before
the application for leave to remain is made (para 67(b) and the  application
for leave to remain must have been made no more than 3  months  "before  the
start of the employment as stated on the Certificate of  Sponsorship"  (para
67(b) (emphasis added)).

22. These provisions unambiguously make clear that it is for the migrant  to
indicate the  Tier  2  category  in  his  application  and  that  this  must
correlate  with  the  employment/job  as  stated  on  the   Certificate   of
Sponsorship. But the employment/job as stated by  the  appellant's  employer
in the CoS ( which contains   standard headings asking for  job  title,  job
type, summary of job description, gross pay, frequency of pay, etc.) was:

    "Job title: FIELD IMMIGRATON ADMINSTRATOR
      Job type: 2419 Legal professional's n.e.c."

23. It is true that under the next entry, "Summary of job  description"  the
employer had set out the same description given in the appellant's  contract
of employment, but the plain fact is that (1) it was the  sponsor  employer,
not the respondent who chose the job  type  and  who  specified  2419  Legal
professional's n.e.c."; and 2) all the respondent did was record that  entry
and thereby treat it as the basis for consideration of the application.

24. The appellant's submissions have sought to argue that  in  view  of  the
fact that the CoS details supplied by his employer gave a  detailed  summary
of his job description, in the context  of  deciding  the  application  made
under the Immigration Rules it was ultimately a matter  for  the  respondent
to decide whether the classification specified was  the  correct  one.  That
cannot be regarded as a fanciful submission since from a common sense  point
of view it might seem odd to leave entirely to a sponsor to choose  the  job
type when there may be instances where sponsors seek  falsely  to  represent
that an applicant is doing a specific  job  on  the  UKBA  list  of  skilled
occupations just to help applicants.

25. Common sense, however, is not necessarily a feature  that  pervades  the
Immigration Rules dealing with the PBS system  as  we  know  it.  And  as  a
matter of construction we can find nothing in  the  relevant  provisions  of
Appendix A to support the appellant's submission.  Not  only  do  they  make
clear that the employment must be as stated by the  Sponsor  but  they  also
particularise that the respondent's response is made  by  an  agency  called
the CoS Checking Service and that its role is confined to (i) recording  the
relevant job (para 69(a) refers to "the job that the  CoS  Checking  Service
entry records that the person is being  sponsored  to  do");  (ii)  checking
that it appears  on  the  UKBA  list  of  occupations  skilled  to  National
Qualifications Framework level 3;  and  (iii)  confirming  that  the  salary
recorded by the same Service is at or above the  appropriate  rate  for  the
job as stated in guidance published by the UKBA. For applicants such as  the
appellant whose Sponsor states that they have met the  requirements  of  the
resident labour market test, the Service entry  is  also  required,  (iv),to
check that the Sponsor had met the requirements of that test, as defined  in
guidance published by the UKBA "in respect  of  that  job"  (para  71).  The
above tasks to be performed by  the  CoS  Checking  Service  are  all  about
ticking boxes, not making independent assessments.

26. The  respondent  in  response  to  Tribunal  directions  maintains  that
nothing in the relevant provisions of the Rules  authorises  the  caseworker
to choose the appropriate occupation or review the  specification  given  by
the Sponsor. They maintain further   that  caseworkers  are  only  assessing
whether the details on the CoS conform with  the  details  on  the  relevant
code of practice in respect of specified matters such as whether the  salary
paid will be at least as much  as  the  appropriate  rate  set  out  in  the
relevant code of practice. For reasons we have already given,  we  find  the
respondent's submissions on this issue entirely accurate. The conclusion  to
which we are driven is that despite the fact that the FTT failed to  address
the appellant's main argument, Ground (2) does  not  to  show  that  the  IJ
erred in law.

27. We would observe, however, that the  analysis  we  have  just  given  is
confined to the basis on which Ground (2) was advanced before us, namely  as
a challenge to the meaning of the relevant  immigration  rules.  We  do  not
rule out that in terms of our "in accordance with the  law"  jurisdiction  a
failure  on  the  part  of  the  respondent  to  consider  a  different  job
classification might in certain circumstances conflict with the duty to  act
fairly. But that was not the basis on which Ground  (2)  was  made  and  the
conclusions we reach below on Ground (1) mean that there is no need  for  us
to consider the matter in any event.

28. It is convenient next to deal with Ground (3).

Ground (3)

29. Ground (3) concerns the matter of whether the IJ gave due  attention  to
the respondent's avowal of its PBS  system,  Tier  2  in  particular,  as  a
"flexible system", as stated by  the  Home  Office  Press  release  dated  7
August 2009 which was produced by the appellant. It will  be  apparent  from
what we have said earlier that the relevant provisions  of  the  Immigration
Rules do not confer any discretion on caseworkers and that points  can  only
be awarded if the criteria set out in the Rules are  met  in  full.  It  may
well be that the PBS scheme has some flexibility in certain other  respects,
allowing for example, sponsors  and  applicants  to  correct  mistakes,  but
neither the appellant nor his sponsor sought to correct any of the  relevant
details they had submitted  in  respect  of  the  appellant  save  by  later
alleging as a  ground  of  appeal  that  his  occupation  had  been  wrongly
classified -  and then only in the rather confusing context of  an  argument
that  in  making  a  decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules  it  was   the
respondent, rather than  the  applicant  and  sponsor  themselves,  who  was
responsible  for  the  choice  of  occupational  code  2419.  We  have   now
established that it was the sponsor and applicant who specified  code  2419,
not the respondent. Further, even if this is taken  as  an  attempt  by  the
appellant to correct a  mistake,  neither  the  applicant  nor  the  sponsor
sought to identify any alternative occupational classification specified  in
the Codes of  practice  which  they  considered  was  more  appropriate.  As
already observed, the Rules make quite  clear  that  the  selection  of  the
occupational code is solely a matter for the  sponsor  in  conjunction  with
the applicant. So do the Codes of practice themselves: for  example  on  the
first  page  of  version  06/09  dealing  with  Section   M   (Professional,
scientific and technical activities"), the  sponsor/user  is  told:  "Choose
the SOC code that is most relevant to the job you are looking  to  fill  and
then you will be taken to a page giving you more information  on  the  skill
level, appropriate salary rate and how to meet the  resident  labour  market
test".

30. So too does the Tier 2 policy guidance which states  that  "If  you  are
unsure what SOC code applies to your occupation; you may wish to  check  the
coding index of job titles on the Office for National  Statistics  website".
We cannot see in such circumstances that there was anything in  the  conduct
of the respondent  in  relation  to  the  appellant's  case  that  could  be
characterised as a failure to act  or  a  failure  to  apply  any  permitted
flexibility to his case. And, insofar as policy guidance can  be  source  of
policy more generous than the Rules, the provisions of the  policy  guidance
relevant to the appellant's case contain nothing fitting  that  description.
Hence Ground (3) must fail.

Ground (1)

31. But that is not the end of the matter;  there  is  also  Ground  (1)  to
consider. This ground contended first of all that the respondent's  decision
was not in accordance with the Immigration Rules for  the  reason  that  the
guidance referred to, namely the SOC codes of practice,  was  not  specified
in the body of the Rules and was not in existence as  at  the  date  of  the
relevant change to the Rules.

32. Whist not agreeing with this ground as it stands, we consider  it  right
in asserting that the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as
applied to this appellant includes ones that were unlawful.

33. So far as we can ascertain, the relevant parts of  the  Rules  refer  to
two extraneous sources: UKBA policy guidance (para 69(b) and para 70) and  a
UKBA list of skilled occupations (para 69(a), 82). There is no reference  as
such to codes of practice although they are referred to  and  identified  in
the policy guidance. Paragraphs 219-221 of  that  guidance  state  that  the
sponsor must pay the migrant at the appropriate rate for the  job  and  that
when advertising the vacancy,  it  must  be  advertised  at,  or  above  the
appropriate rate for the job, and  those  rates  are  set  out  in  Standard
Occupational Classification (SOC) codes of practice.

34. Where  does  that  leave  matters  relevant  to  the  appellant's  case?
According to the information provided by the respondent in response  to  our
directions, the relevant provisions of the Rules  (para  69  in  particular)
were first laid before Parliament on 4 November 2008 and  came  into  effect
on 27 November 2008. The codes of practice referred to  in  the  Rules  were
first posted on the UKBA website on 17 September 2008, i.e. on a date  prior
to, not post, the relevant provisions of the Rules. (The codes  of  practice
have  been  updated  periodically  since,  although  in   respect   of   the
occupations of possible relevance  to  the  appellant's  case,  the  version
11/09 which was in  force  at  the  date  of  decision  was  not  materially
different from the original version 06/09.). So  it  would  appear  that  at
least in temporal terms the  codes  of  practice  were  a  source  that  was
Pankina-compliant. Whether they were also Pankina-compliant  in  substantive
terms is another matter. From our earlier summary of case  law,  it  can  be
seen there has been a  discussion  as  to  whether  reliance  on  extraneous
sources is unlawful if all those sources do is provide the means of  proving
eligibility by reference  to  publicly  available  classifications  and  the
like. In the R (on the application of the JCWI)  [2010]  EWHC  3542  (Admin)
Sullivan LJ noted that the court in Pankina did not  say  that  reliance  on
extraneous sources was always unlawful and he suggested that whether it  was
would depend upon where a  particular  case  fell  along  a  spectrum,  with
substantive changes being at one end and non-substantive  changes  being  at
the other end. Indeed he then gave the UKBA's list  of  skilled  occupations
as a possible example of cases at the non-substantive end of  the  spectrum.
However, in R (Alvi) at para 40 Jackson  LJ  doubted  whether  the  list  of
skilled occupations belonged at the non-substantive  end  of  the  spectrum.
From this survey we can see that there is at least an argument that  sources
such as SOC codes and practice and UKBA lists  of  skilled  occupations  are
concerned with the means of proving  eligibility  rather  than  setting  out
additional substantive criteria. However, we do not  need  to  resolve  this
matter in this case. That is so for the following reasons.

35. As already noted, in order to comply with para 69 an  applicant  has  to
show not just that the salary is at an appropriate  rate  (by  reference  to
codes of practice) but also that the job is on  the  UKBA  list  of  skilled
occupations.   The  respondent's  reply  to  directions  does  not  tell  us
anything about when that list was placed on the UKBA website but Jackson  LJ
in R (Alvi) records that the  UKBA  list  of  skilled  occupations  was  not
placed on UKBA's website until 28 November (para  11)  i.e.  24  days  after
Appendix A was laid before Parliament (para 40). Further, Jackson,  LJ  adds
"the list was capable of being amended by the Secretary of  State."  (ibid).


36. We are left with a curious situation. In R  (Alvi)  the  application  to
the appellant of para 82  of  Appendix  A  was  found  unlawful  because  it
required the  appellant  to  show  his  job  was  at  a  certain  level   of
qualification (above NVQ or SVQ level 3) even though that was not  specified
in the Rules. It was not necessary for the court to  rule  on  whether  such
application was also unlawful for failure to meet the  two  requirements  in
Pankina relating to the need for the extraneous source to exist  in  advance
of Parliamentary approval of the related Immigration Rules  and  not  to  be
subject to alteration outside that process thereafter. But in  our  case  we
cannot avoid ruling on these two requirements.

37. Unlike the applicant in  R  (Alvi)  it  was  not  in  dispute  that  the
appellant's job as  specified  in  his  CoS  was  on  the  list  of  skilled
occupations. The respondent in this case  considered  that  the  start-point
for consideration of the appellant's  application  was  the  fact  that  the
appellant's job as specified in his CoS was on  the  UKBA  list  of  skilled
occupations. But such a start-point was unlawful because it  was  predicated
on there being a lawfully prescribed list  of  skilled  occupations  in  the
first place. Yet that list had not been laid before Parliament for  40  days
or made subject to the negative resolution procedure.  Secondly,  that  list
could be varied at the will of the Secretary of State. In Pankina the  Court
of Appeal held that  such  features  rendered  reliance  on  such  materials
unlawful.

38.  Accordingly,  the  respondent  could  not  lawfully  decide  that   the
appellant's job was to be classified according to a code  of  practice.   In
turn the IJ was wrong to find that the  respondent's  application  of  these
requirements was lawful. The determination is vitiated by  legal  error  and
we set it aside.

39. The decision we substitute is to allow the appellant's appeal.

40. We would draw attention, as did the Court in R (Alvi)  at  para  40,  to
the fact that the relevant provisions of Appendix A  were  amended  in  July
2010 (the court clearly had  in  mind  HC382  which  as  already  noted  was
published on 22 July and came into effect on 12 August 2010. To what  extent
those amendments have altered the legal position is not  a  question  before
us. Our conclusions are confined, therefore to the provisions of Appendix  A
pre-dating 12 August 2010).

41. We would also observe that as we noted earlier the  Secretary  of  State
now accepts that the relevant codes of practice contain  a  job  type  which
may well match the appellant's job description - that  of  "Legal  Associate
professional".  To  repeat  the  relevant  passage  from  her  Reply  quoted
earlier:

    "Using the job description on the CoS as a guide and  comparing  it  to
    job descriptions on the summary table, SOC code 3520,  Legal  Associate
    Professionals may be more appropriate to the role of the applicant.  It
    is classified as a skilled job and the migrant's salary would be at  or
    above the appropriate rate for the job."


42. If we had dismissed the appeal we would  have  asked  the  Secretary  of
State to think very  carefully  about  whether,  even  so,  the  appellant's
removal would be necessary or if some discretionary leave might better  meet
the justice of the case.

43. For the above reasons:

The FTT materially erred in law and its decision is set aside;

The decision we substitute is to allow the appeal.
