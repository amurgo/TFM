                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
INTRODUCTION

 1. The appellant, a national of the United States, born 28 December  1961,
    has been granted permission to appeal the determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart dismissing her appeal against the  decision
    dated 5 July 2012 refusing the issue  of  a  permanent  residence  card
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006,
    Regulation 15(1)(b).  I heard argument on error of law on 3 April  2013
    and reserved my decision. On 18 April I made my decision that the judge
    had erred in law.  My reasons with minor modification are  incorporated
    in this determination at [2] to [23]. At a further  hearing  on  2  May
    disclosure orders were made addressed to parties who were considered to
    be able to provide evidence that the appellant's husband had worked  in
    the UK: Firstline Locums, Leicester Royal Infirmary and  Shifa  Medical
    Centre. At a resumed hearing on 30 August I  heard  evidence  from  the
    appellant and a witness Ms B.

DECISION THAT THE F-tT ERRED IN LAW.

 2. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Coates.
    However the appellant was successful on renewal of her  application  to
    the Upper Tribunal where  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McGeachy  gave  these
    reasons for granting permission:

         "(1) The grounds of appeal assert that the appellant is entitled to
             a  permanent  residence  card  under  the  Immigration   (EEA)
             Regulations 2006 as she was the wife of an Italian  exercising
             Treaty rights here.  They also claim that she was  the  parent
             of children in education here.

         (2)  The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found that there  was  no
             evidence to  back  up  the  appellant's  assertions  that  her
             husband was working her[e] for the relevant period despite the
             respondent having made searches to find out whether or not  he
             was exercising Treaty rights here.  That was a conclusion that
             was open to her.

         (3)  However, although the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal pointed
             out that the appellant's children  are  adults  it  is,  just,
             arguable that following the decision and opinion  of  advocate
             General Bot given on 15 January [2013] on the reference of the
             Tribunal following the appeal of Alarape (Article 12  EC  Regs
             1612/68 (Nigeria) [2011] UKUT 413 that the Judge of the First-
             tier  Tribunal  placed  insufficient  weight  on  the   mental
             condition of the appellant's daughter and  her  need  for  the
             appellant to be with her here.  In these circumstances I  will
             given permission to appeal."

 3. Miss Asanovic opened her submissions with the explanation that  she  no
    longer relied  on  the  grounds  challenging  the  judge's  conclusions
    regarding the claim to be permanently resident under reg.15(1)(f).   In
    addition she no longer pursed the challenge to the judge's  conclusions
    regarding the claim for a retained right of residence  (reg.10(6))  and
    so abandoned paragraph 14 to 17 of the grounds.  Instead she based  her
    application on  the  judge's  treatment  of  the  derivative  right  of
    residence under reg.15A.

 4. By way of amplification of those  grounds,  Miss  Asanovic  argued  the
    judge had erred in two ways.  The  first  was  with  reference  to  the
    judge's direction at [16] of  her  determination  that  the  derivative
    rights incorporated in the 2012 amendments to the  Regulations  do  not
    apply as the children are over 18 years old.  She relied on  reg.15A(4)
    which is as follows:

         "(4)     P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if -

             (a)  P is the primary carer of a person meeting  the  criteria
                  in paragraph (3) ('the relevant person'); and

             (b)  The relevant person would be unable  to  continue  to  be
                  educated in the United  Kingdom  if  P  were  required  to
                  leave."

 5. This provision follows regulation 15A (1), (2) and (3) which provide:

         "(1) A person ( "P") who is not entitled to reside  in  the  United
         Kingdom as a result of any other provision of these Regulations and
         who satisfies the criteria in paragraph(2), (3), (4) or (5) of this
         regulation is entitled to a  derivative  right  to  reside  in  the
         United Kingdom for as long as P satisfies the relevant criteria.

         (2) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

              (a) P is the primary carer of an EEA national(  "the  relevant
         EEA nationa"); and

             (b) the relevant EEA national -

                  (i) is under the age of 18

                  (ii is residing in the United Kingdom as a self sufficient
             person; and

                  (iii) would be unable to remain in the United Kingdom if P
                  were required to leave.

         (3) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if -

         (a)  P is the child of an EEA national ("the EEA national parent");



         (b)  P resided in the  United  Kingdom  at  a  time  when  the  EEA
             national parent was  residing  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
             worker; and

         (c)  P is in education in the United Kingdom and was  in  education
             there at a time when the EEA national parent was in the United
             Kingdom."

 6. The second error related to the judge  failing  to  take  into  account
    relevant factors  including  the  mental  health  difficulties  of  the
    appellant's daughter and his failure to identify the  correct  test  in
    relation to derivative rights of a  primary  career  coupled  with  the
    failure to properly assess the nature of the relationship gave rise  to
    error. She further argued that the judge erred in identifying  in  [52]
    of her determination a requirement for children being  continuously  in
    education.

 7. Perhaps it  is  best  to  set  out  at  this  stage  the  judge's  full
    conclusions relating to reg.15A appearing in the final paragraph of her
    determination at [52]:

         "I do not accept the  claim  that  the  appellant  has  acquired  a
         derivative right of residence under Regulation 15A.  Regulation 15A
         principally refers to  children  who  are  under  Article  8.   The
         appellant's children are now aged 25 and 23.  There is no  evidence
         of them continuously being in education. I am  not  satisfied  that
         the appellant can be properly described as primary carer  of  a  25
         year old young woman. Whilst she has been  diagnosed  with  bipolar
         disorder she is  not  taking  medication  and  is  well  enough  to
         continue her studies. There is no evidence of the  appellant's  son
         living with her at all. Having already  taken  a  view  as  to  her
         credibility I do not accept her excuse  for   his  non-availability
         for the two hearings."

 8. Miss Asanovic argued that the relationship between  the  appellant  and
    daughter was close. Her daughter had been sectioned  under  the  Mental
    Health Act in 2011. She drew  my  attention  to  the  medical  evidence
    adduced in support. This included a discharge from  section  under  the
    1983 Act dated 9 November 2011 and a letter from Dr   Chaturvedi  dated
    17 August 2012 in these terms:

         "The following report is based on medical records available to  me.
         I have not carried out a medical examination  for  the  purpose  of
         this report.

         Miss S has  been  diagnosed  with  bipolar  affective  disorder  in
         October/ November 2011.  She is known to have three manic  episodes
         and a depressive episode in 2009 as noted in the  letter  from  the
         Mental Health Team - Oxford dated 24 November 2011.  She  has  been
         on olanzapine in past. She is on no medication at present."

 9. The appellant's daughter had provided a statement in which  she  refers
    to her family history and her mental health difficulties. She  explains
    that she was to have completed her degree at Oxford Brookes  University
    by the summer of 2012 and this had been affected by her  disorder.  She
    refers to having been hospitalised after a  manic  episode  in  October
    2011 and to her mother's love and support.  She has not had any further
    episodes since then and believes this was because  she  had  chosen  to
    live with her mother and brother  again.  The  stable  environment  was
    conducive to her mental  stability  and  consequently  better  for  her
    studies.  Her mother takes care of her and her brother and  helps  them
    with the finances for their studies and provides them  with  all  their
    support that they need.  Miss Asanovic argued that  this  evidence  was
    not considered by the judge in the determination in the summary of that
    evidence at [22] and [23].

10. Mr Ouseley argued the judge had  made  a  decision  open  to  her.   He
    considered the judge had directed herself as to the [correct] test  and
    the evidence of the appellant had not been that she needed to  be  here
    for her daughter.  He acknowledged that another judge could  have  come
    to a different conclusion.

11. Discussion then turned to the history of  the  proceedings  before  the
    judge and whether the Secretary of State had addressed  the  derivative
    rights issue.  It was explained that the hearing had been adjourned for
    this specific purpose and this had  been  addressed  in  an  additional
    refusal  letter  dated  22  November  2012  resulting  in   a   further
    immigration  decision.   Specifically  in  respect  of   reg.15A,   the
    Secretary of State had this to say:

         "In July 2012 the EEA Regulations were amended to  incorporate  the
         new Regulation 15A.  New Regulation 15A confers a derivative  right
         to reside on persons claiming a right to reside on the basis of the
         Court of Justice of the  European  Union  (ECJ)  judgments  in  the
         cases of  Ibrahim  (C130/08)  and  Teixeira  (C480/08),  where  the
         relevant criteria are met.

         In the cases of Ibrahim and Teixeira, the Immigration  Judge  rules
         that by virtue of Article 10 of Regulation 492/2011(i) the children
         of an EU citizen who works or has worked in the host  member  state
         (who are in education in that state) and (ii) the primary carer  of
         those children, can claim a right of residence in that State.

         This right of residence is known as a free moment right and FM, but
         is a 'derivative right' which means that the  recognition  of  this
         right by the United Kingdom is not equal to rights under  Directive
         2004/38/EC.  A derivative right can only be issued up to  when  the
         child in question reaches 18 years old.

         This ruling therefore does not apply in your case, as your children
         are both over 21 years old and a derivative right cannot be  issued
         retrospectively. Additionally in order to qualify, it would have to
         be proved the children's EEA father had exercised treaty rights  in
         the United Kingdom and there is no evidence to confirm this."

12. Mr Ouseley candidly acknowledged that this analysis did not seem to  be
    right.

13. No new evidence had been served in response to  the  directions  issued
    with the grant of permission to appeal in the event that error  of  law
    was found.  Miss Asanovic explained that she wished to rely on a letter
    which she had been instructed had been  handed by  her  client  to  her
    solicitors a few days  ago.   Mr  Ouseley  was  content  for  that  new
    evidence to be placed before me and a fax was promptly  received  which
    included letters from Dr Chaplain, a consultant psychiatrist at  Oxford
    Health NHS Foundation Trust dated 25 February 2013 in which  he  refers
    to the appellant as her daughter's main carer.  He  confirms  that  she
    lives with her mother and that her mother needs to provide ongoing care
    for her to be able to manage her mental health and  continue  with  her
    studies at Oxford Brookes University.  Those  care  needs  are  further
    detailed in the letter.

14. The second letter is from Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust dated 28 February
    2013 which confirms the events resulting in  the  appellant's  daughter
    being sectioned in 2011.  For his part following discussions with  Miss
    Asanovic the day prior to the hearing Mr Ouseley has produced a  bundle
    addressing the early history of dealing with the  Home  Office  by  the
    appellant and her husband. These reveal that in 2001  Johar  &  Company
    Solicitors were dealing with the immigration affairs of  the  appellant
    and her husband.  On 1 November 2001 they informed the Home Office that
    the appellant's husband was not in employment in the United Kingdom but
    in employment  in  Italy.   Reference  is  made  to  the  two  children
    attending schools in this country. A further letter from them  dated  6
    November provides more information including confirmation of employment
    from Casa de Cura Santa Chiara, evidence of transfer of funds  from  an
    account in Italy to one held with Halifax Plc in Covert and a wage slip
    of Dr M.

15. At the hearing on 3 April, I observed to the parties that in the  event
    I found an error of law and proceeded to re-make the decision  even  if
    as appeared to be  the  case,  the  new  medical  evidence  showed  the
    significance of the role the appellant plays in her daughter's life, in
    order for her to be entitled to a derivative right  of  residence,  the
    appellant would need to demonstrate that her husband had  in  the  past
    worked in the United Kingdom.  It is correct that he had been granted a
    residence permit.  Miss Asanovic drew  my  attention  to  the  Tribunal
    decision in Samsam (EEA: revocation and retained rights)  Syria  [2011]
    UKUT 00165 (IAC), in particular [29] which is in these terms:

         "However, our conclusions on this topic do not decide the different
         question of the evidential  value  of  possession  of  a  residence
         permit when  a  person  seeks  to  renew  it  or  obtain  permanent
         residence on the strength of it. It is  plain  that  if  the  facts
         reveal that a person was not  exercising  Treaty  rights  then  the
         assistance of a residence card cannot assist. It is not  conclusive
         proof. It may, however be some evidence of past  lawful  status  if
         there is some evidence to support the exercise  of  Treaty  rights,
         nothing to contradict and the historic position can [no] longer  be
         established with precision."

16. The judge had not reached any  settled  conclusion  whether  Dr  M  had
    worked in the United Kingdom at all.  Mr Ouseley scoured his  files  to
    see if there  was  any  evidence  of  UK  employment  produced  to  the
    Secretary of State and the best he was able to find was a letter from a
    firm of medical locums identifying potential opportunity for Dr M.  The
    only other evidence was the oral testimony of  the  appellant  and  her
    daughter. Having regard to his standard of proof I considered that more
    was  required.   Both  parties  invited  me  to  give  them  a  further
    opportunity to address this.

17. Miss Asanovic wanted to make enquiries of the locum firm and Mr Ouseley
    wished to undertake a more thorough examination of the  extensive  Home
    Office file. I decided to  permit  this  and  accordingly  reserved  my
    decision on whether the judge had made an error of law.  In  the  event
    that I was satisfied she had, I would remake the decision based on  the
    evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  together  with  the  medical
    evidence served at  the  hearing  on    and  any  further  evidence  in
    documentary form relating to Dr M's employment provided  that  evidence
    was filed with the Upper Tribunal and served on the Secretary of  State
    no later than 24 August.  Likewise Mr Ouseley was directed to  disclose
    any documents relating to this issue by no later than that  date.   The
    appeal would be restored for hearing confined to the issue whether  the
    appellant's daughter is entitled  to  exercise  the  derived  right  of
    residence under reg.1612/78 and for  her  mother  a  derived  right  of
    residence as a consequence.

18. I now turn to my conclusions on whether the judge  erred  in  law.   It
    appears to me that she did not direct herself accurately with regard to
    the test which was to be applied. Having misdirected herself  that  the
    derivative  rights  incorporated  in  the  2012   amendments   to   the
    Regulations did not apply as the children were over 18 years  old,  she
    further directed herself at [52] that reg. 15A "principally referred to
    children who were under Article 8". I am also satisfied that she failed
    to take into account the appellant's daughter's evidence regarding  the
    role her mother plays in her life and the way in which this enables her
    to continue with her studies.

19. The correct approach is that set out in Teixeira at [84] to [87].

         "84. It must be examined, second, whether the fact that the  rights
             the child derives from Article 12 of Reg.  1612/68  have  thus
             been held to apply,  without  any  condition  as  to  age,  to
             children who have reached the age of majority or are no longer
             dependent on the migrant worker means that a parent caring for
             an adult child can reside with that child in the  host  Member
             State until the completion of his or her education.

         85.  In paragraph 73 of Baumbast and R, the  court  held  that  the
             right of children of a migrant worker  to  pursue,  under  the
             best possible conditions, their education in the  host  Member
             State would be infringed if the person  who  was  the  primary
             carer were not able to reside with the child  in  that  Member
             State during the period of education.

         86.  Although children who have reached the age of majority are  in
             principle assumed to be capable of meeting  their  own  needs,
             the right of residence of a  parent  who  cares  for  a  child
             exercising the right to education in the host Member State may
             nevertheless extend beyond that age, if the child continues to
             need the presence and care of their parent in order to be able
             to pursue and complete his or her education.  It  is  for  the
             referring court to assess whether that is actually the case in
             the main proceedings."

20. I am satisfied that the challenge to the judge's factual  findings  are
    more than a disagreement as it is evident she did not take into account
    or there is no indication what weight she gave to the material evidence
    of the appellant's daughter of the need  for  her  mother's  continuing
    presence to assist her in her studies.

21. The decision of the judge is therefore set aside and is to be re-made.

22. I need little persuasion that having  regard  to  the  letter  from  Dr
    Chaplain  the  appellant's  mother  plays  an  important  role  in  her
    daughter's life and that her presence is needed  for  her  daughter  to
    continue her studies.  I quote from the second paragraph of his  letter
    of 25 February 2013:

         "Her mother, Mrs H, is her main carer. She lives  with  her  mother
         and her mother needs to provide ongoing care for her to be able  to
         manage her mental health and continue with her  studies  at  Oxford
         Brookes University.  This includes giving her support  on  a  daily
         basis in order that she refrains  from  taking  drugs  and  alcohol
         which have been major precipitators in  her  manic  episodes.   She
         also needs to ensure that she does not leave  the  house  at  night
         time, for example to go to clubs where she will be vulnerable  from
         taking illegal substances and exploitation. She also needs to  make
         sure that S eats on a regular basis and provides meals for her."

23. Compelling as this evidence may be, this is not enough.  It needs to be
    established that the appellant's daughter commenced her studies  whilst
    her father was working in the United Kingdom.

EVIDENCE GIVEN AT THE HEARING ON 30 AUGUST.

24. At the resumed hearing on 30 August I heard evidence from the appellant
    and a witness, Ms B and I was also asked to take into  account  further
    documentary evidence submitted by the appellant's solicitors with their
    letter of 20 August in determining the issue whether at any time during
    the appellant's daughter's presence in the United  Kingdom,  Dr  M  has
    worked.  At the outset of the hearing Miss Asanovic reminded me of  the
    Tribunal decision in Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano  reg  15A(3)(c)  [2006]  EEA
    Regs) [2013] UKUT 00089 (IAC), in particular paragraph 3  of  the  head
    note in these terms:

         "Notwithstanding inability to  satisfy  new  reg.15A(3)(c)  of  the
         Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  as  amended
         with effect from 16 July 2012, the parent of  a  child  of  an  EEA
         national who has been employed in the UK when the  child  was  also
         residing here can have a derived right of residence  under  Article
         12  of  Regulation  1612/68  (now  Article  10  of  Regulation  No.
         492/2011) even though the EEA national parent is no longer a worker
         in the UK at the time the child commences education:  see  Case  C-
         480/08 Teixiera [2010] EUECJ, 23 February 2010."

25. The evidence provided earlier included correspondence from the  Italian
    Consulate Manchester, the Home Office,  Johar  and  Company,  Firstline
    Locums. HD and Jobcentre Plus. In addition there is a company search on
    Shifa Medical Centre and statements of an account with Halifax  in  the
    names of the appellant and Dr M.

26. The evidence accompanying the letter from Turpin Miller  of  20  August
    2013 comprises -

    (a)  a statement by Ms B;

    (b)  a statement by AM (which states that she would  not  be  available
         from 9 July - the statement is dated 9 June 2013  together  with  a
         copy of the particular page from her British passport;

    (c)  copy letters passing between the appellant's solicitors and  Shifa
         Medical Centre and Firstline Locums Limited of varying dates;

    (d)  copy of an e-mail from Leena Patel, Deputy Manager HRSS  from  the
         University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trusts confirming that  Dr  M
         had not worked at the Trust.

27. The appellant did not  rely  on  her  first  statement  and  adopted  a
    supplementary  statement  which  Miss  Asanovic  had  taken  from   her
    following my direction during  the  lunch  adjournment.   In  this  she
    refers to the following matters -

    (i)  Dr M arrived in the UK in May 2001 and arranged a house into which
         the family moved into in July 2001;

    (ii) he soon thereafter started working through an agency.  He was  not
         registered with the GMC and did not therefore  do  the  work  of  a
         qualified doctor but that of a  senior  nurse.   He  had  to  study
         English in order to obtain full GMC registration on 25 January 2002
         and thereafter he worked for "agencies";

    (iii)    the appellant recalled the named of one agency as  Locum.   He
         worked mostly in Leicester, Manchester and  London.   She  used  to
         take him lunch sometimes when he  worked  in  the  Royal  Leicester
         Infirmary.  He was not employed  by  the  NHS  but  worked  through
         agencies;

    (iv) the couple bought a house at the end of 2003.  The mortgage  would
         not have been paid had her husband not worked;

    (v)  the appellant gives details of the work that she had undertaken;

    (vi) she was not fully familiar with  Dr  M's  financial  arrangements.
         She did not know why he would have received payments by  electronic
         transfer and later making cash deposits.  He left the  family  home
         in April 2008 and the appellant had  to  move  in  with  her  niece
         because she was unable to afford to pay the mortgage;

    (vii)    the house was in Dr M's name and he sold it without consulting
         her.

    (viii)   A large payment of just under �10,000 in the account  resulted
         from the sale of two cars in Italy.  Dr M had  two  bank  accounts.
         As to why the bank account (evidence of which had been produced  at
         the hearing) stopped around 17 November 2003 she believed  he  must
         have started using one of the other accounts more.  He  would  give
         her cash which she used to operate the household billing.

    (ix) As to the explanation for instalments from  an  international  ATM
         between September 2004 and June 2005, Dr M's sister  who  lived  in
         Mogadishu needed a kidney transplant.

    (x)  The appellant also knows that Dr M worked  for  a  medical  centre
         called Shifa because she had found a note with  the  centre's  name
         amongst  the  few  possessions  which  were  left  behind  when  he
         departed;

    (xi) the parties' divorce in Italy is not yet finalised.  The appellant
         had tried to get documents through her Italian  lawyer  as  to  her
         husband's work history but he is refusing to  co-operate.   He  has
         been underhand in his dealings with her;

    (xii)    HD is in Mostar on a two year contract until 2013 (this person
         being the author of a letter dated 5 April 2013) who states that he
         had worked with Dr M  between  2001  and  2003  when  he  moved  to
         Leicester;

    (xiii)   AM is in Egypt where her brother, the appellant's  nephew  was
         killed in the recent protests.

28. Under cross-examination the following matters emerged:

    (i)  the appellant no longer had the note with Shifa  Medical  Centre's
         name explaining that it was a long time ago;

    (ii) the appellant was aware her husband had two accounts with  her,  a
         Halifax current  account  and  a  savings  account  to  the  United
         Kingdom.  He had two further accounts with HSBC and Barclays in his
         name and in addition three accounts in Italy;

    (iii)    she had no idea why the solicitors  had  written  in  November
         2001 in the terms that they had;

    (iv) the appellant believed her husband had been  paid  electronically.
         She had never been to Shifa Medical Centre;

    (v)  when the family first came to  the  United  Kingdom  they  had  to
         survive and he had to do a job even though he was  over  qualified.
         He was on night shift, however the appellant was unaware whether he
         had taken this employment under his own name.  When she visited him
         at the Royal Infirmary in Leicester, she did not know what name  he
         had used and as to his identity card, he had  a  temporary  "thing"
         with his initials, not his full name.  She would  bring  him  lunch
         once a week, sometimes two times.

29. Miss Asanovic had no re-examination, however I sought clarification  on
    aspects of the evidence from which the following emerged:

    (i)  the appellant did not know whether Dr M did any work at the  Royal
         Leicester Infirmary after his registration with the GMC.   She  was
         not aware whether he had done any hospital  work  at  any  location
         thereafter.  After such registration he had  worked  with  a  local
         agency and there were "other agencies".  The local one would employ
         him a lot as a consultant.  As to  where  this  work  was  she  was
         pretty sure it was at  nursing  homes  in  Manchester  as  she  had
         answered calls coming through.  She thought this  could  have  been
         hospitals also;

    (ii) the couple had ceased living together in April 2008;

    (iii)    the house had been purchased with  a  mortgage  and  that  her
         husband had signed the papers for her.  She  guessed  the  mortgage
         had been from HSBC.

30. Mr Ouseley raised further questions for the appellant arising out of my
    questions.  When it was put to the appellant that he had  pretended  to
    use her name, explanation was that the husband was afraid the  property
    would be taken so he had told her he had signed it for her but she  did
    not believe this to be the case as when he sold (the property) she  had
    not been contacted.  He had told her that he had  put  her  name  down.
    She trusted him; they had been married for 21 years.

31. Miss Asanovic obtained clarification that the appellant had visited her
    husband in Leicester (infirmary) at the end of 2001 and  2002  but  she
    had not visited him after his GMC registration in 2002.

32. Ms B adopted a short  statement  explaining  that  she  had  known  the
    appellant since 2001 and that they had met because a mutual friend  had
    asked her if she would mind taking the children to school  because  she
    was new in the country and did not have any means  of  transport.   She
    was aware that Dr M had worked for an agency as a doctor  between  2001
    and 2005.  She knew this to be true because on  several  occasions  she
    had given him a lift to the train station to attend work.  It also paid
    the fees for his children's tuition with her son.

33. Under cross-examination Ms B explained that Dr M told her where he  was
    going when she gave him a lift.  She explained  that  she  was  at  the
    house and he had told her that he had to go to work and so she gave him
    a lift.  Both Dr M and the appellant had told her of his work.

34. I sought clarification why she had been at the family house  and  Ms  B
    explained that she used to help the family by taking  the  children  to
    school and bringing them back.  It was no hardship taking Dr M  to  the
    train station.  She was not an employee and had just helped  out.   The
    petrol costs in taking the children to school were  paid.   As  to  the
    period of time over which she carried out this role she speculated this
    was eighteen months to two years although then thought it may have been
    longer and had to stop in 2005 as her son had been taken ill.

SUBMISSIONS

35. I thereafter heard submissions.  In summary Mr Ouseley argued that  the
    evidence was vague and referred me to the documentation which indicated
    that Dr M had not worked in the United Kingdom and also argued that  Dr
    M had not been generally honest.  The evidence of  the  second  witness
    was what Dr M had told her.

36. Miss Asanovic also made detailed submissions all of which I have  taken
    into account in assessing the material before me.  She sought to  place
    emphasis on a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions recording
    employment and support allowance rates paid to the appellant  dated  14
    January 2012.  Her initial contention was that these payments would not
    have been made available  to  the  appellant  had  she  not  been  here
    lawfully based on her husband's employment.  There followed a  detailed
    exchange of submissions on disclosure of the information which had been
    provided by the appellant in support  of  her  benefits  claim.   After
    taking instructions Miss Asanovic indicated the appellant did not  wish
    to rely on this evidence to support her contention that Dr M had worked
    in the United Kingdom.

37. I reserved my determination.

CONCLUSIONS

38. The parties have accepted that if the appellant is able to  demonstrate
    that Dr M worked in the United Kingdom the appellant would  succeed  in
    her appeal based on her  derived  rights  by  virtue  of  her  daughter
    continuing in education here at Oxford Brookes University until 2015 in
    the light of the  need  for  her  to  be  here  having  regard  to  her
    daughter's mental health difficulties.  What  should  be  a  relatively
    straightforward task to obtain reliable confirmation of  employment  of
    someone who obtained registration in the United Kingdom as a doctor and
    who is said to  have  worked  here  regularly  between  2002  (in  that
    capacity) until 2008 thus resulting in a public profile has not  proved
    possible.  There is no confirmation of that employment from any of  the
    employers it is claimed  that  he  had  been  with.   Contrary  to  the
    testimony of the appellant, the Royal Leicester Infirmary  stated  that
    he had had not worked for them.  Even if  he  had  obtained  employment
    with the hospital through an agency, I consider  it  reasonably  likely
    that there would have been an enduring record at the  hospital  of  his
    individual presence. It  is  not  disputed  that  the  General  Medical
    Council registered M, on 25 January 2002 as a medical practitioner with
    specialist registration reflected in a date of  current  entry  from  9
    November 2006 but that of itself is not enough to demonstrate  that  he
    took employment here as a doctor.

39. The letter from the Italian Consulate in Manchester dated 25 July  2002
    is of no assistance since it does not confirm that Dr  M  had  obtained
    employment before registration.  The letter from Johar & Company  of  1
    November 2001 to the Home Office in response to an enquiry whether Dr M
    was exercising his treaty rights specifically states that he was not in
    employment in the United Kingdom but in  employment  in  Italy.   Their
    further letter of 6 November 2001 refers  to  enclosures  that  include
    receipts for transfer of funds from an account in  Italy  to  one  held
    with the Halifax PLC in Coventry and a  wage  slip  for  Dr  M.   There
    follows this text:

         "We would advise that  the  majority  of  these  documents  are  in
         Italian as our client is more often than not working in Italy.   He
         has funds set up in the  United  Kingdom  and  further  documentary
         evidence of this shall be forwarded shortly".

40. The statement of a joint account between Dr  M  and  the  appellant  at
    Halifax Bank covers a date range of 6 July 2001 and 16 September  2009.
    There is a pattern in the earlier  years  of  regular  payments  in  of
    varying amounts by CHAPS payments with no  indication  of  the  source.
    Three are for the same amount of �988 on 24  July,  11  October  and  2
    November 2001.  There was also a payment  of  �1,988  by  CHAPS  on  24
    September 2001.  These payments are  interspersed  with  other  varying
    amounts including for that year CHAPS payments on  14  August  2001  of
    �1,300 and on 28 November 2001 of �1,188 as well as a cash  transaction
    on 11 July of �587.50.  It has been reasonably open  to  the  appellant
    since it is a joint account to obtain confirmation from the bank of the
    source of these funds.

41. A letter from Firstline Locums Limited dated  29  July  2002  does  not
    confirm employment but explains that there are a  number  of  positions
    that have come up but mainly Dr M's needs.

42. As to the witnesses  who  did  not  attend  the  hearing,  AM  explains
    enigmatically that Dr M was staying at her house whilst he was  setting
    up the London Health Clinic.  There was no mention by the appellant  of
    her husband having undertaken such an activity.  She refers to M having
    been self-employed and yet as reminded by Mr Ouseley, enquiries by  the
    Secretary of State with HMRC did not result in any record of employment
    as  observed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in   [8]   of   her
    determination.  AM refers to Dr M working "during the period  of  2001"
    in Leicester and during 2005 in London.  There  has  been  no  previous
    mention of  a  London  Health  Clinic  having  been  established.   The
    statement is silent as to the  time  between  2001  and  2005  and  the
    explanation that he was working that year is not reconcilable with  the
    statements by the appellant's solicitors

43. The letter from HD explains that, "In my former capacity  of  Community
    Health Coordinator with PCT then with LPT of  NHS  trust  I  acquainted
    with Doctor M an Italian-Somali Doctor who is specialised  in  Internal
    Medicine,  Cardiology  and  Emergency  Medicine  within  the  remit  of
    bridging the gap of Somali community health needs  project"(the  actual
    text preserved). She also refers to having worked  with  Dr  M  between
    2001 and 2003 and that he had worked for  as  Medical  Staffing  agency
    and, "used to travel for work inside Leicester and wherever he was sent
    by the agency.

44. This witness was unable to attend the hearing which limits  the  weight
    that can be given but the letter contains leads that  could  have  been
    readily pursued to obtain confirmation from the PCT and NHS  trust.  It
    is significant that this has not been done and it is  also  significant
    that the community activity in the  letter  is  not  mentioned  by  the
    appellant.

45. As to the oral testimony, the appellant states that her husband  worked
    and yet her evidence is curiously vague and short of the detail I would
    expect from somebody giving an account of their  partner's  activities.
    She is clearly an articulate person and  it  is  difficult  reconciling
    that with her weak evidence.  Ms B' evidence does not take matters much
    further.  I accept that she helped the family and took Dr M  from  time
    to time to the railway station.  If this was for  the  purpose  of  him
    travelling to work she did not know where he had gone to or the precise
    nature of what he would be doing.  Her evidence needs to be  considered
    against the relative vagueness of that of the appellant.

46. The evidence must be  taken  in  the  round  in  deciding  whether  the
    appellant has demonstrated on the balance  of  probabilities  that  her
    husband has worked in the United Kingdom.  I am unable  to  accept  her
    own testimony and that of Ms B in the face of the evidence as  analysed
    above. The statement of the  joint  bank  account  indicates  a  steady
    stream of varying credits to the account, however I  am  not  satisfied
    that the source was employment in the  United  Kingdom.   The  evidence
    does not establish that Dr M worked in the  United  Kingdom  before  he
    left in April 2008 and it follows  that  the  appellant  is  unable  to
    succeed in her appeal.

47. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge has been set  aside.
    The re-making of the decision has been on the narrower basis  than  the
    case first advanced by Miss Asanovic.   The  appellant  has  failed  to
    demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the EEA  national  was
    working in the United Kingdom at any  time  prior  to  the  appellant's
    daughter's education here or subsequently.

48. The appeal is dismissed.
