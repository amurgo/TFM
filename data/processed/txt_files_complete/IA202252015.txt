                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Timson, Counsel instructed by Eden Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Bangladesh date of birth  31st  October
    1980.  On  the  23rd  February  2016  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Chambers) allowed his appeal against a decision to refuse to grant  him
    leave to remain on human rights grounds. The Secretary of State now has
    permission[1] to appeal against that decision.


 2. The matter in issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    refusal to grant Mr Miah limited leave to remain was a disproportionate
    interference with his private and family life as protected by Article 8
    of the European Convention on  Human  Rights.  The  Tribunal  made  the
    following findings in Mr Miah's favour:


              i) He is in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  his
                 British wife, Ms Sharmin [S];


             ii) Ms [S] earns over ï¿½18,600 per year;


            iii) There would be "very significant obstacles" to  the  couple
                 continuing their family life in Bangladesh. She would  lose
                 her job, which in the current market would be difficult  to
                 replace.   They  would  therefore  be   without   financial
                 support. Her elderly mother, resident in  the  UK,  depends
                 upon the couple, for instance requiring their help to  take
                 medication  and   attend   appointments.    Relocation   to
                 Bangladesh would further result in Ms [S] losing her  right
                 to fertility treatment provided by the  NHS,  a  matter  of
                 "immense importance" to her:  interruption in the treatment
                 she currently receives would likely have an adverse  impact
                 on her physical and emotional wellbeing.

 3. Findings (i)-(iii) led the Tribunal to  allow  the  appeal  "under  the
    Immigration Rules".   The  issues  raised  in  (iii)  further  led  the
    Tribunal to conclude  that  there  were  good  reasons  to  proceed  to
    consider the matter under Article 8 'outside of  the  Rules'.  In  this
    section of the  determination  the  Tribunal  considered  the  damaging
    consequences for Ms [S] of being forced to leave the United Kingdom and
    indeed the European Union. It noted that the couple are  no  burden  to
    the public purse and  the  Secretary  of  State's  submission  that  an
    application for entry clearance by Mr Miah  would  in  all  probability
    succeed. The Tribunal found there to be little point in Mr  Miah  going
    back to Bangladesh, with all the expense and disruption that this would
    entail. Finding the decision to be  disproportionate,  the  appeal  was
    also allowed under 'freestanding' Article 8.


 4. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal fall into two parts.  It  is
    first contended that the First-tier Tribunal erred in its  approach  to
    the Immigration Rules, and  second  that  the  analysis  of  Article  8
    outside of those Rules was flawed for material misdirection.


    The Immigration Rules

 5. The appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  brought  against  a
    decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to grant leave  to  remain
    with reference to Appendix FM. In her decision dated 15th May 2015  the
    Secretary of State noted that as Mr Miah  was  an  overstayer  (he  had
    previously been a work permit holder) he could not  succeed  under  the
    'five year route to settlement'.   The only way that he could get on to
    the alternative  'ten  year  route'  under  Appendix  FM  would  be  by
    establishing that he  met  the  requirements  in  EX.1,  which  by  the
    Secretary of State reckoning, he could not do.  The  relevant  part  of
    paragraph EX.1 reads:
         EX.1. This paragraph applies if
         ...
         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.
    The Secretary of State did not accept that there  were  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to family life continuing in Bangladesh  and  this  was  the
    basis of the refusal.  This was the sole matter  in  issue  before  the
    Tribunal[2].

 6. The Secretary of State makes two complaints about the way in which  the
    Tribunal dealt with that matter. Firstly,  it  is  submitted  that  the
    Tribunal applied the incorrect test.  Paragraphs 6-8 use  the  language
    of  "significant  obstacles"  and  "very  significant  obstacles".  The
    Secretary of State submits it to be clear from this that  the  Tribunal
    did not apply to the facts the test contained in EX.1:  "insurmountable
    obstacles".


 7. In reply Mr Timson points out that the determination in fact does refer
    to "insurmountable obstacles" at both paragraphs 8  and  15.  That  the
    terms are used interchangeably  cannot  sensibly  be  argued  to  be  a
    misdirection given the terms  of  paragraph  EX.2,  inserted  into  the
    immigration Rules to explain what EX.1 might mean:
         EX.2. For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which would be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their family
         life together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or
         would entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their
         partner.
 8. That is a good point.  There is no error in the fact that the terms are
    both used. I find that Judge Chambers clearly had the correct  test  in
    mind. That is demonstrated  by  the  fact  that  he  expressly  directs
    himself to consider whether there would be "insurmountable  obstacles".
    He considers the cumulative factors in the round to conclude that there
    were. There is no error of law in his legal direction.


 9. The Secretary of State's second point is that  the  factors  identified
    are  not  capable  of  amounting  to  "insurmountable   obstacles"   as
    elucidated in EX.1. reliance is placed on the decision of the Court  of
    Appeal in R (on the application of Agyarko & Ors) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  In  that  case  Sales  LJ
    noted that the test is significantly more demanding than a mere test of
    whether it would be reasonable to expect a  couple  to  continue  their
    family life outside the United Kingdom.  In the case of Mrs Agyarko the
    Court declined to disturb the Secretary of State's assessment that  the
    difficulties a British  citizen  might  face  in  relocating  to  Ghana
    amounted to insurmountable obstacles [at 25].  In  respect  of  another
    appellant the Court found that her desire to pursue fertility treatment
    in the UK was not a matter capable of meeting the  test  [at  50].  The
    appeals against refusal to grant permission for  judicial  review  were
    thereby dismissed.

10. I am not satisfied that the reasoning of Judge Chambers  was  perverse.
    In Agyarko the Court was considering applications for judicial  review,
    or in other words whether the conclusions of  the  Secretary  of  State
    were within the reasonable range of responses.  In one case it was held
    that she was entitled to conclude that disruption to a settled life  in
    the UK was not sufficient. In another, the fact that an  applicant  was
    herself receiving fertility treatment  was  not  a  matter  capable  in
    itself of presenting a very  significant  obstacle.  In  this  case,  a
    statutory appeal where Judge Chambers was entitled to exercise his  own
    discretion, he held that these factors taken cumulatively along with  a
    Kugathas dependency of an elderly relative, was enough. He was entitled
    to take that view.  This ground amounts to no more than a  disagreement
    with the Judge's decision.

11. There was no error of law in the  First-tier Tribunal's approach to the
    Rules, as contended in the grounds.

12. I add one comment. Although the point is not taken in  the  grounds,  I
    understood  Ms  Petterson  to  allude  in  her  oral   submissions   to
    jurisdiction. The right of appeal in this case was simply human rights,
    yet the Judge purported to 'allow  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules'. Although I heard no detailed argument on  the  point,  for  the
    sake of completeness I note that in the  context  of  this  application
    under Appendix FM, compliance with the Rules  amounts  to  the  removal
    being a disproportionate interference with Article  8  rights,  and  so
    unlawful under s6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

13. The new statutory framework is set out in s82 Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended):

          "82 Right of appeal to the Tribunal
         (1) A person ("P") may appeal to the Tribunal where-

         (a) the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a protection claim
         made by P,

         (b) the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a human rights
         claim made by P, or

         (c) the Secretary of State has decided to revoke P's protection
         status.

         ...



         "84 Grounds of appeal
         ...

         (2) An appeal under section 82(1)(b) (refusal of human rights
         claim) must be brought on the ground that the decision is unlawful
         under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.


14. In her guidance entitled 'Rights of appeal: Guidance on when there is a
    right of appeal  against  decisions  in  immigration  cases,  including
    mechanisms to prevent repeat rights of appeal and  prevent  delay  from
    appeals  against  unfounded  claims'  (version   3.0)   (undated)   the
    Respondent provides a list of the Immigration Rules  deemed  to  engage
    Article 8:

         "The following applications made under the Immigration Rules are
         human rights applications and the starting position is that there
         is a right of appeal against refusal.

|Immigration Rule (Category of application) :                      |
|Paragraph 276B (long residence)                                   |
|                                                                  |
|Paragraphs 276ADE(1) or 276DE (private life)                      |

|Forces)                                                           |
|                                                                  |
|Paragraphs 276AD and 276AG (partner or child of a member of HM    |

|HM Forces and has at least 4 years' reckonable service in HM      |
|Forces at the date of application                                 |
|                                                                  |
|Part 8 of these Rules (family members) where the sponsor is       |
|present and settled in the UK or has refugee or humanitarian      |
|protection in the UK                                              |
|But not: paragraphs 319AA to 319J (PBS dependents), paragraphs    |
|284, 287, 295D or 295G (sponsor granted settlement as a PBS       |
|Migrant)                                                          |
|Part 11(asylum)                                                   |
|                                                                  |
|Part 4 or Part 7 of Appendix Armed Forces (partner or child of a  |
|member of HM Forces) where the sponsor is a British Citizen or has|
|at least 4 years' reckonable service in HM Forces at the date of  |
|application                                                       |
|                                                                  |
|Appendix FM (family members)                                      |
|But not: section BPILR (bereavement) or section DVILR (domestic   |
|violence)                                                         |

15. Whilst there is no longer any right of appeal on the grounds  that  the
    decision is "not in accordance with the law", this guidance makes clear
    that an appeal dealing with  an  application  made  under  Appendix  FM
    should be  treated  as  a  human  rights  appeal.  The  fact  that  the
    requirements of the rule, in this case EX.1, are found  to  be  met  is
    sufficient to allow  the  appeal.  That  is  what  I  understood  Judge
    Chambers to mean when he  writes  "the  appeal  is  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules".


    Article 8 'outside of the rules'


16. It follows that I need not address the Secretary of State's grounds  in
    respect of Article 8 since the appeal succeeded with reference to EX.1.
    I would only note that had the  reasoning  under  the  Rules  been  set
    aside,  so  too  would  the  reasoning  on  Article  8,   because   the
    determination fails to address,  either  expressly  or  impliedly,  the
    factors set out in section 117B of the 2002 Act.


      Decisions


17. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law such that it should be set aside.  The decision is upheld.


18. There is no order for anonymity.

[1] Permission granted on the 27th July 2016 by First-tier Tribunal Judge
Pedro

[2] The refusal letter raises an issue as to Mr Miah's English language
ability but the parties before me agreed that this matter had been resolved
in his favour before the appeal commenced. That the determination makes no
mention of this refusal ground would indicate that this is so.
