                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Howells, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent (hereafter the claimant) entered the UK  in  2006  as  a
    student and after being granted a further period in the  same  capacity
    was first granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant
    and then as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant with leave valid  until  2  July
    2016.  Just before expiry of her leave she applied for ILR on the basis
    of ten years continuous residence.  On 16 February 2018  the  appellant
    (hereafter the Secretary of State  or  SSHD)  refused  her  application
    under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules:

         "...because as  part  of  your  Tier  1  General  leave  to  remain
         application of 4 April 2011 you claimed  to  have  an  increase  of
         �39,486.44 from all sources between 01  April  2010  and  31  March
         2011, including �4,538.44 for pay-as-you earn (PAYE) employment and
         �34,948 from self-employment.  On this basis you  were  awarded  20
         points under the 'previous earnings' category (for earnings between
         �35,000 and �39,999.99).  That is you declared a figure  above  the
         minimum to obtain  these  points  towards  the  overall  80  points
         required in order to granted leave under Tier 1 General."

2.   The SSHD went on to note that records showed that for tax year 6  April
    2010 to 5 April 2011 the claimant originally declared  earnings  (total
    income) of �5,305, the source of  income  being  from  self-employment.
    The SSHD observed that if she had submitted earnings of �5,305 to  UKVI
    in support of her leave to remain application dated 4 April 2011, "then
    you would have received 0 points for previous earnings... and you would
    have been 20  points  short  of  obtaining  leave  under  your  Tier  1
    (General) application and you would not, therefore, have  been  granted
    leave to remain." Observing that the claimant had subsequently  amended
    the figures declared to HMRC so they  were  more  in  line  with  those
    claimed  to  UKVI,  the  SSHD  noted  that  the  claimant's  accountant
    (Heartlands Financial Services Ltd) only made contact with HMRC with  a
    view to amending these figures on 6 May 2016.  This  delay  of  several
    years indicated, stated the SSHD, "that you  had  little  intention  of
    correcting the error promptly and as such shows little respect for  the
    UK tax laws".  The SSHD did not accept as a credible explanation that a
    registered  accountant  would  submit  a  self-assessment  tax   return
    declaring earnings which were  considerably  lower  than  the  client's
    actual earnings.

3.   Having found that paragraph 322(5) applied against  the  claimant,  the
    SSHD also refused her under paragraph 276B(ii) and (iii).

4.   The claimant's  appeal  came  before  Judge  Aujla  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT).  The claimant gave oral  evidence  at  her  appeal  and
    produced a bundle of documentation in support.  In a decision  sent  on
    17 October 2018  Judge  Aujla  outlined  her  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.  The judge summarised her oral evidence at paragraph 26:

         "26.  The  Appellant  gave  oral  evidence  at  the  hearing.   She
             confirmed her name and address and stated that she was born on
             24 April 1983.  Her witness statement dated  01  October  1918
             was correct and she adopted the same  as  her  evidence.   She
             stated that she was working during the relevant year.  She had
             become pregnant and later lost the child during  that  period.
             Furthermore, her father had also been diagnosed  with  various
             complaints during that period after which he passed away.  She
             was under extreme stress at that time.  The tax return for the
             relevant year was prepared by her agent who was  Vijay  Karee.
             He was associated with a firm of  accountants.   She  did  not
             know whether he was qualified in accountancy.  There  were  no
             criminal proceedings taken against  her.   She  was  currently
             working for Hilton Metropole Hotel.  She had been assessed  to
             pay �8,000 income tax for the income during the relevant  year
             which she was  paying  in  instalments.   She  started  making
             payments from 2016.  The correct income figures were  supplied
             to HMRC on 06 May 2016 by her accountants.   That  was  before
             she made the application on 30 June 2016."

5.   At paragraph 31 the judge stated:

         "31. I observed the Appellant give evidence with care.  I  have  no
             reason to doubt her credibility.  An error was clearly made in
             declaring her income to HMRC.  She had given to her agent  all
             the relevant documentation.  When she  discovered  that  there
             had been a  mistake,  her  accountants,  Heartlands  Financial
             Services Ltd, wrote a letter to HMRC on 06 May 2016  in  which
             the correct income figures  were  provided  for  the  relevant
             year.  As a result of that  corrected  information,  HMRC  had
             issued the Appellant with an assessment under  which  she  was
             liable to pay �8000 income tax which she had  been  paying  by
             instalments since 2016."

6.   Having turned to consider whether the claimant come within any  of  the
    categories set out in  the  Home  Office  guidance  for  refusal  under
    paragraph 320(5), and having found  that  the  claimant  did  not  come
    within any of the categories, the judge concluded at paragraphs 34 - 35
    that:

         "34. An error was clearly made in declaring  her  income  to  HMRC.
             She was working as a business consultant.  She  had  given  to
             her agent all the relevant documentation.  There  was  clearly
             an error made in declaring  the  income  to  HMRC.   When  she
             discovered that there had been  a  mistake,  his  accountants,
             Heartlands Financial Services Ltd, wrote a letter to  HMRC  on
             06 May 2016 in which the correct income figures were  provided
             for  the  relevant  year.   As  a  result  of  that  corrected
             information, the HMRC had assessed the  Appellant  income  tax
             liability and she was discharging that liability since 2016.


         35.  I  particularly  bear  in  mind  the  fact  that  the  correct
             information was supplied to HMRC on 06 May  2016,  before  the
             Appellant made her application on 30 June 2016.  I  also  take
             into account the Appellant personal circumstances during  that
             period, including her pregnancy and miscarriage, which I  have
             no reason to reject."

7.   The SSHD's grounds submitted that the judge's reasoning amounted  to  a
    material misdirection of law in that he had  effectively  absolved  the
    claimant of blame for the large discrepancies and  appeared  to  accept
    that the claimant's accountant was to blame.  That conflicted with  the
    guidance given by the Upper  Tribunal  in  R  (on  the  application  of
    Samant) v  SSHD  [2017]  UKUT  JR/6546/2016  and  Abbasi  JR/13807/2016
    wherein it was said it was the applicant who must  take  responsibility
    for his own tax affairs.  It was argued that the  judge  was  wrong  to
    treat as significant the fact that the HMRC had  not  taken  action  to
    criminally prosecute the claimant.

8.   In amplifying the SSHD's grounds before me Mr  Howells  prayed  in  aid
    the repeated case of R (on the application of Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty,
    tax return, para 322(5) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC).

9.   At the hearing before me I heard submissions from Mr  Howells  for  the
    SSHD.  The claimant, who represented herself, gave a brief response.

10.  I have no hesitation in rejecting  the  SSHD's  grounds.   Two  matters
    lead me to this conclusion.

11.  The first is that nowhere in the grounds does the SSHD take issue  with
    the judge's positive  credibility  findings.   As  already  noted,  the
    claimant gave oral testimony before the judge and the judge went on  to
    find at paragraph 31 that he had no reasons to doubt  her  credibility.
    If the claimant was credible,  then  she  had  failed  to  declare  her
    earnings for the tax year 2010/11 not  because  of  any  dishonesty  or
    improper purpose but simply because she was under extreme stress at the
    time and relied on her agent.  It was open to the SSHD in  the  grounds
    to challenge the positive credibility finding but that was not done.

12.  Second, none of the cases relied on by the SSHD establish  that  it  is
    necessarily an error  of  law  for  a  judge  to  accept  a  claimant's
    explanation  for  submitting  an  incorrect  tax  return  based  on  an
    accountant mistake.   What is set out in the headnote  to  Khan  is  as
    follows:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an
             inference could  be  expected  where  there  is  no  plausible
             explanation for the discrepancy.


         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
             despite  the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State  must
             decide whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient,  in
             her  view,  to  displace  the   prima   facie   inference   of
             deceit/dishonesty.


         (iii)    In approaching the fact-finding  task,  the  Secretary  of
             State should remind herself that,  although  the  standard  of
             proof is the 'balance of probability', a finding that a person
             has been deceitful  and  dishonest  in  relation  to  his  tax
             affairs with the consequence that he is denied  settlement  in
             this  country  is  a  very  serious   finding   with   serious
             consequences.


         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
             'error' in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be
             the end of the matter,  given  that  the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was
             accurate and to have signed the tax return.   Furthermore  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty.


         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):


               i. Whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is
                  plausible;


              ii. Whether the documentation which can be  assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;


             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error  had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected.


              iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has  taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

13.  It is clear from (ii) that where an applicant  has  presented  evidence
    to show he or she was not in fact dishonest the decision maker  has  to
    decide whether that explanation and evidence is  sufficient.   That  is
    what Judge Aujla did in this case.

14.  It is clear from (v) that when  considering  whether  an  applicant  is
    dishonest or merely careless  the  decision-maker  has  to  consider  a
    number of matters, including (iii) "why the applicant did  not  realise
    then an error had been made ...."  In the claimant's case the  evidence
    was that she was under extreme stress.  During the relevant period  she
    had lost a child through stillbirth and her father had  been  diagnosed
    with serious complaints (he later died).  There  were  clearly  matters
    which the judge weighed in the claimant's  favour  when  assessing  the
    issue of alleged dishonesty.  The judge's finding on  this  issue  were
    within the range of reasonable responses.

15.  The SSHD also contended that the judge gave undue weight  to  the  fact
    that the claimant was not prosecuted.   However  at  paragraph  30  the
    judge only treats the lack of prosecution as one relevant consideration
    and even under the SSHD's own guidance, consideration of criminality or
    its lack is a relevant factor.

16.  For the above reasons I conclude that the judge did not err in law  and
    accordingly his decision to allow the appeal must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
