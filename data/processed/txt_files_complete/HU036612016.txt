                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Freer, promulgated on  21  December  2016.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted to the Respondent by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  on  13
    February 2017.

Anonymity

   2. A direction has been made previously, and is re-iterated below.

Background

 3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 14 October 2005 with  entry
    clearance as a student. He made a series of  in-time  applications  for
    further leave to remain, the last of which was refused on  1  May  2013
    with a  right  of  appeal.  He  appealed  unsuccessfully  against  that
    decision and his appeal rights were exhausted on 29 March 2014.  On  23
    April 2014, the appellant applied for further  leave  to  remain  under
    Tier 4. That application was treated as void by the respondent  because
    the appellant subsequently made further applications, the critical  one
    being a human rights application  made  13  February  2015,  which  was
    refused with a right of appeal. The appellant lodged an  appeal  on  29
    May 2015 but subsequently withdrew it  following  his  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain  on  long  residency  grounds,  made  on  24
    September 2015. The refusal of that application on 25 January  2016  is
    the relevant decision in this appeal.

 4. The decision of 25 January 2016 contended that the appellant  had  been
    without valid leave from 29 March 2014; had held lawful leave for  just
    8 years  and  5  months  and  therefore  had  not  acquired  10  years'
    continuous lawful residence  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  respondent
    considered whether discretion ought  to  have  been  exercised  in  the
    appellant's favour  but  noted  that  he  had  failed  to  provide  any
    exceptional reasons why his application of 23 April was  made,  out  of
    time. Furthermore, the instant application was lodged one  year  and  5
    months after his lawful leave ceased and thus  it  was  said  that  the
    requirements of paragraph 276B(v)  were  unmet.  Leave  to  remain  was
    refused  under  Appendix  FM  because  the  appellant  had  failed   to
    demonstrate that there were any insurmountable obstacles to family life
    continuing  outside  the  United  Kingdom  with  his  British  partner.
    Furthermore, no exceptional circumstances had been raised and therefore
    his application did not fall for a grant of leave  outside  the  Rules.
    The appellant was granted a right of appeal on the sole ground that the
    decision was unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,
    because the respondent had decided to refuse his human rights claim.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. Following the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the  judge  found
    that the voided application of 23 April 2014  did  not  result  in  the
    appellant's leave lapsing because it was a duplicate application. Thus,
    the appellant's leave under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971  was
    extended until  beyond  the  10-year  point.  The  judge  rejected  the
    appellant's claims as  to  his  medical  condition  amounting  to  very
    significant obstacles to integration under paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of
    the Rules and family life under Appendix  FM.  He  allowed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules, indicated that the appellant succeeded  on
    human rights as the respondent's decision was not  in  accordance  with
    the law, but ultimately dismissed the appeal on human rights grounds.

The grounds of appeal

 6. The respondent's application, made out-of-time, argued that  the  judge
    materially  misdirected  himself  in  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules when the appellant had  a  limited  right  of  appeal
    under section 84(1)(b) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 as amended by the 2014 Immigration Act.  There  were  said  to  be
    clear findings that the appellant  did  not  succeed  on  human  rights
    grounds.

 7. The appellant's grounds, submitted 13 days' late,  sought  to  preserve
    his should permission be granted to the respondent. It  was  maintained
    that the judge's findings  as  to  the  accrual  of  10  years'  lawful
    residence was legally and factually  correct.  The  first  of  the  two
    grounds argued that the judge's conclusion that the appellant  did  not
    succeed outside the Rules was flawed because he did not engage with all
    the arguments put forward on his behalf  and  his  conclusions  on  the
    threshold test were arguably inconsistent with decision in Paposhvili v
    Belgium. The second ground argues that the  judge  construed  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) too narrowly regarding the evidence that the  appellant's
    life expectancy would be significantly shortened.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted to the respondent on the basis that is
    was plainly arguable that the judge did not "have the right to grant an
    appeal under the Immigration Rules." The  appellant's  application  was
    refused, the judge  finding  no  error  in  the  reasons  provided  for
    dismissing the human rights appeal.

 9. The appellant renewed his application for permission on 29  March  2017
    on the  same  grounds.  The  appellant's  Rule  24  response  was  also
    submitted on that date, in  which  it  was  said  that  any  error  was
    immaterial, that the findings in respect of 10 years' lawful  residence
    was determinative of the  human  rights  aspect  and  the  respondent's
    appeal was academic.  It was further  said  that  the  fact  the  judge
    states that he is allowing the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  was
    no more than a misstatement. Furthermore, an application on  10  years'
    residence grounds was described in Home  Office  Guidance  as  a  human
    rights' claim in any event.

10. On 6 April 2017, the Deputy-President  directed  that  the  appellant's
    outstanding application for permission to appeal be listed for an  oral
    hearing to be decided at the hearing of the appeal by the respondent.

11. The Secretary of State forwarded a skeleton argument on 26 May 2017, in
    which it was maintained that the judge had no jurisdiction to allow the
    appeal under the  Rules;  it  was  accepted  that  the  respondent  had
    materially  misunderstood  the  Rules  and  which  conceded  that   the
    appellant could show the  requisite  10  years'  lawful  residence.  An
    assertion was made that it was unlawful for a judge to seek to allow an
    appeal with reference to paragraph 276B in a human rights appeal  where
    the respondent had not first considered  and  sought  to  exercise  her
    discretion under 276B(ii) in respect of public interest issues and that
    the other elements of 276B must also be shown, such as 276B(iv).

12. In the skeleton argument it was further conceded that the  respondent's
    CID did not reveal any objections under 276B(ii) and that the appellant
    had  produced  a  valid  Knowledge  of  Life  in  the  United   Kingdom
    certificate and therefore the judge's  failure  to  engage  with  these
    aspects had no material adverse effect. Nonetheless, it was argued that
    if the judge was to allow the human rights appeal with reference to the
    Rules, he was obliged to apply the relevant Rule at  the  date  of  the
    hearing. Referring to 276B(iii)  of  the  Rules  and  cross-referencing
    paragraph 322(12), it was contended that the respondent was notified on
    9 May 2016 that the appellant  had  an  outstanding  debt  to  Barking,
    Havering & Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust of  ï¿½20,945.32.  It
    was argued that these subsequent events could not have been decided  by
    the judge as the primary decision  maker.  Furthermore,  the  appellant
    must have known that he owed money to  the  NHS  when  his  appeal  was
    heard.

13. The respondent invited the Upper Tribunal to set aside  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision and proceed to remake the  appeal  with  the  outcome
    that it is not in accordance with the law because  the  respondent  has
    yet  to  consider  her  discretion.  That  approach  would  allow   the
    respondent to look at the ILR application again on the  basis  that  he
    had 10 years' continuous lawful residence  and  taking  a  view  as  to
    whether to invoke paragraph 276B(iii).  Alternatively, the issue of the
    appellant's debt to the NHS would  be  relevant  to  any  rehearing  of
    Article 8 issues in the event the appellant was granted an extension of
    time and identifying material errors.

The hearing

14. Mr Lee handed up a short written submission addressing the issue of NHS
    entitlement, in which it was contended that the appellant was  entitled
    to NHS treatment because he was both ordinarily resident  and  lawfully
    present in the United Kingdom.  He argued that  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed on human rights grounds.

15. I drew  the  representatives'  attention  to  [58]  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision, where under the heading  'Human  Rights'  the  judge
    said as follows;

    "I find that no proportionality exercise is needed as  he  succeeds  on
    human rights, as the decision was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.
    However, I may be overturned on long residence and that  would  nullify
    this argument. So, as a  fall-back  position,  I  should  go  over  the
    holistic approach to private and family life."

16. Mr Jarvis did not  accept  that  this  was  sufficient  to  rescue  the
    decision and that the judge ought to have considered the long residence
    issue as part of his Razgar analysis. On the NHS issue, Mr Jarvis  said
    that it may well be that the appellant was not required to pay the sums
    said to be outstanding. He drew my  attention  to  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had addressed the issue in his witness statement  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Nonetheless, he asked me to find  that  judge  was
    wrong, set his decision aside and to re-make the decision so  that  the
    ILR application remains outstanding before the Secretary of  State.  He
    added that were I to uphold the decision or  to  allow  the  appeal  on
    human rights grounds, this might lead to a lesser grant of leave.

17. Mr Lee stated that the appellant's cross-appeal  was  unlikely  to  add
    much. He argued that the judge's decision was clear, except for his use
    of language as to the outcome of the appeal. There was  no  doubt  that
    the appellant met the requirements of the Rules and that the respondent
    was wrong to refuse to grant him ILR. Either the judge made no error or
    it  was  not  one  in  substance.  He  suggested  that  an  explanatory
    determination might assist. He invited me to find that the  judge  made
    no material error of law as a fair interpretation of the  decision  was
    that the judge concluded that the  respondent's  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law. If there was an error as to form, it  was  not
    material because the appellant would inevitably succeed on the findings
    made by the judge. Today, the respondent was not able to say  that  the
    NHS point would have made a difference to the outcome of the appeal. He
    clarified that he was not  pressing  the  appellant's  application  for
    permission unless I disagreed with the  parties  on  the  10-year  rule
    issue (which I did not).

Decision on appellant's application for permission to appeal

18. The appeal was brought out of time and only after the respondent sought
    permission to appeal. I nonetheless extend time given  the  explanation
    set out in the grounds and in the interests of justice. Ultimately,  Mr
    Lee did not seek to rely on the grounds, preferring to  concentrate  on
    opposing the respondent's application.  Given  the  lack  of  continued
    reliance on the grounds, I find that  no  material  error  of  law  was
    identified and refuse permission to appeal.

Decision on error of law

19. At [57] of his  decision,  the  judge  allowed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules, having been satisfied that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirement of paragraph 276B(i) that is, he had  established  that  he
    had continuous lawful residence for a period of at least 10  years.  As
    accepted by the parties, the judge had no  jurisdiction  to  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules because  this  appeal  concerned  an
    application for further leave to remain made after 6 April 2015.   This
    amounted to a material error of law.

20. While the judge initially indicated that  the  appellant  succeeded  on
    human rights grounds [58], he ended his decision by  stating  at  [77],
    "The freestanding aspect of the appeal fails on both private and family
    life."  Clearly, those findings were contradictory.

21. The judge's notice of decision stated that the appeal was allowed under
    the Rules and dismissed on human rights grounds, whereas there  was  no
    appeal under the Rules available to the appellant  and  the  judge  had
    stated both that the human rights appeal succeeded and  failed  in  the
    same decision. These erroneous and contradictory findings cannot  stand
    and are set aside,  albeit  with  all  the  judge's  findings  of  fact
    preserved.

22. I therefore proceed to remake the decision.




    Remaking of decision

23. In view of the respondent's belated acceptance that the  appellant  had
    in fact resided lawfully and continuously in the United Kingdom for  at
    least 10 years by the time of the decision  of  25  January  2016,  the
    claims in the said  notice  were  plainly  wrong.   Indeed,  Mr  Jarvis
    invited me to find that the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the
    law.

24. There is the matter of the appellant's NHS entitlement. At paragraph 20
    of his witness statement, the appellant  explained  that  it  was  only
    owing to the Secretary of State  informing  the  NHS  that  he  was  an
    overstayer that they were seeking to recover the cost  of  his  medical
    treatment and had already sent  him  an  invoice  for  that  treatment.
    Evidently, the information supplied to the NHS by  the  respondent  was
    incorrect because the appellant's leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    had been extended by section 3C  of  the  1971  Act  and  he  was  not,
    therefore, an overstayer. Mr Jarvis conceded  that  Mr  Lee's  argument
    that the appellant was entitled to receive NHS treatment free of charge
    may well be correct given that  the  appellant's  leave  never  lapsed.
    However, the respondent  has  yet  to  consider  the  exercise  of  her
    discretion in relation to this issue.

25. In view of the respondent's error as to the appellant's leave  as  well
    as failing to exercise discretion in relation to paragraph 276B(iii) of
    the Rules, with reference to paragraph 322(12), this appeal is  allowed
    on the basis that the respondent's decision is not in  accordance  with
    the law and  therefore,  the  appellant's  application  for  settlement
    remains outstanding, awaiting a lawful decision  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.

Conclusions


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision to be re-made.

I substitute a decision allowing the appeal on the basis that the  Secretary
of State's decision was not in accordance with the law.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of any fee  which  has  been  paid  or  may  be  payable  because  the
respondent   has   acknowledged   that   the    decision-maker    materially
misunderstood the immigration rules when the decision was made.
