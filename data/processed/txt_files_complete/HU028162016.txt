For the Appellant:     Mr A Slatter, Counsel instructed by CNA solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The Appellant appeals against  a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
       Judge  Callow  promulgated  on  21  April  2017   ("the   Decision")
       dismissing her appeal against the  Respondent's  decision  dated  14
       January 2016 refusing her leave to remain as the spouse of a  person
       settled in the UK.


    2. The Appellant is the spouse of Mr Abdi  Ali  Dini  ("the  Sponsor").
       The couple are both from Somalia.  They were married in Mogadishu on
       15 April 1998.  The Sponsor came to the UK in 2006,  seeking  asylum
       and was naturalised as a British citizen  on  11  April  2012.   The
       Appellant came to the UK on 29 December 2012 with entry clearance as
       a spouse, giving her leave to remain until 26 August 2015.


    3. The Appellant's in-time application for further leave was  initially
       rejected as invalid for failure to pay a fee and then for failure to
       provide an original passport.  Her subsequent valid application made
       on 23 September 2015 was refused by the Respondent's decision  under
       appeal for failure to provide evidence to show that  she  meets  the
       income threshold requirements in  Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration
       Rules ("the Rules"). Since the Respondent did not  accept  that  the
       Appellant met all the eligibility requirements under the Rules,  she
       considered her application also applying EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  but
       rejected the case on  that  basis  because  the  Appellant  had  not
       provided  evidence  of  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
       continuing in Somalia.  It is worthy of note at this juncture  that,
       although the  Sponsor  claimed  asylum  in  the  UK,  that  was  not
       apparently the basis on which he was granted leave to remain as  his
       grant of indefinite leave  did  not  show  any  restriction  to  him
       travelling back to Somalia.


    4. Judge Callow found that the evidence before him did not satisfy  the
       evidential requirements  in  Appendix  FM-SE.   He  found  that  the
       Respondent had not unlawfully failed to exercise her  discretion  in
       relation to evidential flexibility.  He went on to suggest that  the
       Respondent ought to consider granting the Appellant leave to  remain
       outside the Rules as, if further evidence  had  been  requested,  it
       would have been possible  for  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  to
       provide evidence showing that they could  satisfy  the  Rules.   The
       Judge purported to dismiss the appeal "under the Rules and Article 8
       of the ECHR".


    5. Permission to appeal the Decision was granted by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge Page on 1 August 2017 in the following terms:-


            "[2] The grounds of appeal are arguable.  It is argued that the
           judge has failed to take into account material evidence,  namely
           the sponsor's payslips, when considering whether  the  appellant
           could meet the financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  namely
           �18,600 minimum income.  It is argued that the judge has  failed
           to consider the payslips in the appellant's bundle which went up
           to  August  2015,  incorrectly  concluding  that  the  sponsor's
           payslips ended on 26 June 2015.  It is argued that if the  judge
           [had] not made this mistake the appellant's proven income  would
           have made a total  of  �18,905.82,  in  excess  of  the  minimum
           threshold requirement of �18,600..."


    6. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision contains a
       material error of law and, if so, to re-make the decision  or  remit
       the appeal for rehearing to the First-Tier Tribunal.


    Legal Framework


    7. The requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner are to  be
       found at R-LTRP.1.1 of Appendix FM to the Rules as follows:-


            "The requirements to be met for limited leave to  remain  as  a
       partner are -
                  a) the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;
                  b) the applicant must have made a valid  application  for
                     limited or indefinite leave to remain  as  a  partner;
                     and either
                  c) (i)     the applicant must not fall for refusal  under
                     Section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
                     (ii)    the applicant meets all of the requirements of
                     Section E-LTRP: Eligibility for leave to remain  as  a
                     partner; or
                  d) (i)     the applicant must not fall for refusal  under
                     S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
                     (ii)    the applicant meets  the  requirements  of  E-
                     LTRP.1.2-1.12. and E-LTRP.2.1.; and
                     (iii)   paragraph EX.1.1. applies."


    8. The Respondent  refused  the  application  on  the  basis  that  the
       Applicant does not meet the eligibility  requirement  as  to  income
       requirements. The application was not rejected on the basis  of  any
       other of the  eligibility  requirements.  The  relevant  eligibility
       requirement reads as follows (so far as relevant in this case):-


            "Financial requirements
           E-LTRP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence,  from
           the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of -
                 a) a specified gross annual income of at least -
                      i) �18,600
                    .......
             E-LTRP.3.2.       When  determining   whether   the   financial
           requirement in paragraph ELTRP.3.1 is  met  only  the  following
           sources may be taken into account -
                 a) income of the partner from specified employment...
                 b) income of the applicant from specified employment...."


    9. What is considered to be specified evidence  of  the  income  relied
       upon is set out in Appendix FM-SE to the  Rules  which,  so  far  as
       relevant, reads as follows:-


             "A1.  To  meet  the   financial   requirements   under   ...E-
           LTRP.3.1...of Appendix FM, the applicant must meet:
                  a) The level of financial requirement applicable  to  the
                     application under Appendix FM; and
                  b) The requirements specified in  Appendix  FM  and  this
                     appendix as to:
                        i) The permitted sources of income and savings;
                       ii) The time periods and  permitted  combinations  of
                           sources  applicable  to  each  permitted   source
                           relied upon; and
                      iii) The evidence required for each  permitted  source
                           relied upon.
           1. In relation  to  evidencing  the  financial  requirements  in
              Appendix FM the following general provisions shall apply:
                    a) Bank statements must
                       ......
                       (iv)  cover the period(s) specified...
                       .......
                 (l)    Where  this  Appendix  requires  the  applicant  to
                 provide specified
                        evidence relating to a period which  ends  with  the
                       date of  application,  that  evidence,  or  the  most
                       recently dated part of it, must be dated  no  earlier
                       than 28 days before the date of application.
                       ......
           2. In respect of salaried employment in  the  UK  (except  where
              paragraph 9 applies), all of the following evidence  must  be
              provided:
                 (a)   Pay slips covering:
                  (i)    a  period  of  6  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                       application if the person has been employed by  their
                       current employment for at least 6 months  (and  where
                       paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not apply); or
                 (ii)  any period of salaried employment in the  period  of
                       12 months prior to the date  of  application  if  the
                       person has been employed by  their  current  employer
                       for less than 6 months (or at least 6 months but  the
                       person does not  rely  on  paragraph  13(a)  of  this
                       Appendix)...;
                 .......
                 (b)    A  letter  from  the  employer(s)  who  issued  the
                 payslips at paragraph
                       2(a) confirming:
                       (i)    the  person's  employment  and  gross  annual
              salary;
                       (ii)  the length of their employment;
            (iii)      the period over which they have been or were paid
                              the  level  of  salary  relied  upon  in  the
              application; and
                       (iv)  the type of employment (permanent,  fixed-term
                 contract or
                             agency)
                 (c)   Personal bank statements corresponding to  the  same
                 period(s) as the
                       payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that  the  salary
                       has been paid into an account  in  the  name  of  the
                       person and their partner jointly.
                       .....
            Calculating Gross Annual Income under Appendix FM
            13.  Based on evidence  that  meets  the  requirements  of  this
           Appendix, and can be taken into account with  reference  to  the
           applicable  provisions  of  Appendix  FM,  gross  annual  income
           under...E-LTRP.3.1. will be calculated in the following ways:
            (a)  Where the person is in salaried employment  in  the  UK  at
                       the date of application, has been employed  by  their
                       current employer for at least six months and has been
                       paid throughout the period of six months prior to the
                       date of application at a level of gross annual salary
                       which equals or exceeds  the  level  relied  upon  in
                       paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual income will be
                       (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the total of:
            (i)  the level  of  gross  annual  salary  relied  upon  in  the
                       application..
            (b)  Where the person is in salaried employment  in  the  UK  at
                       the date of application  and  has  been  employed  by
                       their current employer for less than 6 months (or  at
                       least 6 months  but  the  person  does  not  rely  on
                       paragraph 13(a)), their gross annual income  will  be
                       the total of:
            (i)  the gross annual salary from employment as it  was  at  the
                       date of application;
            ....
            In addition, the requirements of paragraph 15 must be met.
            .....
            (k)  Where the application relies on the  employment  income  of
                       the applicant and the sponsor, all that  income  must
                       be calculated either  under  sub-paragraph  13(a)  or
                       under sub-paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 15,  and  not
                       under a combination of these methods.
                 15.   In respect of  paragraph  13(b)...the  provisions  in
this paragraph also apply:
                       (a)   In order to evidence the level of gross  annual
income required by
                       Appendix FM, the person must meet the requirements in
                       paragraph 13(b)...and;
                       (b)   The person must also meet the level  of  annual
      gross income required
                             by Appendix FM on the basis that  their  income
      is the total of:
                         i) The gross income from  salaried  employment  in
                            the UK ...
                            earned by the person in the 12 months prior  to
                            the date of application
                             ....."


   10. Appendix FM-SE has its own evidential flexibility rules which, again
       so far as relevant read as follows:-


           "D.   (a) In deciding an application in relation to which this
           Appendix states that specified documents must be provided, the
           Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-
           maker") will consider documents that have been submitted with
           the application, and will only consider documents submitted
           after the application where sub-paragraph (b), (e) or (f)
           applies.
                 (b) If the applicant:
                  (i) Has submitted:
                       (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the
                       documents in the sequence have been omitted (e.g. if
                       one bank statement from a series is missing);
                       (bb) ..... or
                       (cc) ..... or
                       (dd) A document which does not contain all of the
                     specified information; or
                     (ii) Has not submitted a specified document
                 the decision-maker may contact the applicant or his
                 representative in writing or otherwise, and request the
                 document(s) or the correct version(s). The material
                 requested must be received at the address specified in the
                 request within a reasonable timescale specified in the
                 request.
                 (c) The decision-maker will not request documents where he
                 or she does not anticipate that addressing the error or
                 omission referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a
                 grant because the application will be refused for other
                 reasons.
                 (d) If the applicant has submitted:
                  (i) .....; or
                  (ii) ...., or
                  (iii) A document that does not contain all of the
                  specified information, but the missing information is
                  verifiable from:
                       (1) other documents submitted with the application,
                       (2) ...., or
                       (3) .....,
                 the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the
                 decision-maker is satisfied that the document(s) is genuine
                 and that the applicant meets the requirement to which the
                 document relates. The decision-maker reserves the right to
                 request the specified original document(s) in the correct
                 format in all cases where sub-paragraph (b) applies, and to
                 refuse applications if this material is not provided as set
                 out in sub-paragraph (b).
                 (e).....
                 (f)   Before making a decision under Appendix FM or this
                 Appendix, the decision-maker may contact the applicant or
                 their representative in writing or otherwise to request
                 further information or documents.  The material requested
                 must be received at the address specified in the request
                 within a reasonable timescale specified in the request."


   11. In the event that the Applicant is unable to show that she does  not
       meet all the eligibility requirements, she may  nonetheless  succeed
       under the Rules if she meets EX.1.1.  That reads as follows (so  far
       as relevant):-


            "EX.1.1. This paragraph applies if
                  a) (i)....
                  b)  the  applicant   has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                     relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is  a
                     British Citizen, settled in the UK or in the  UK  with
                     refugee leave or humanitarian  protection,  and  there
                     are insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that
                     partner continuing outside the UK
             EX.2.       For  the  purposes  of   EX.1.(b)   "insurmountable
           obstacles" means the very significant difficulties  which  would
           be faced by the applicant or their partner in  continuing  their
           family life together outside the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
           overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
           or their partner."


   12. Section 117B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("section
       117B") is also relevant.  That reads, so far as relevant as follows:-






            "Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
cases

           (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
      public interest.
           (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.
           (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
           financially independent, because such persons-
           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.
           (4) Little weight should be given to-
           (a) a private life, or
           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
           that is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.
           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established
           by a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
           precarious."

      Error of law decision and reasons


   13. Mr Jarvis for the Respondent accepted there is an error  of  law  in
       relation to [21] of the Decision which reads as follows:-


            "[21]      While in Miah [2012]  EWCA  Civ  261  the  Court  of
           Appeal rejected the idea of there being  a  free-standing  'near
           miss' argument in immigration cases where  the  applicant  falls
           just short of the  requirements  of  the  Rules,  I  presume  to
           recommend the respondent exceptionally grant the appellant leave
           to remain outside the Rules.  Had the case been prepared with an
           eye to detail, it could reasonably have been expected  that  the
           sponsor's missing payslips would  have  been  produced  and  the
           appellant's letter from her erstwhile employer would  have  been
           drafted  to  comply  with  the  Rules.   Had  the  payslips   in
           particular been produced their production would have resulted in
           satisfying the MIR of �18,600"


       That is the Appellant's ground [8].


   14. As Mr Jarvis rightly accepted, this is an appeal against the refusal
       of a human rights claim.  The issue  for  the  Judge  was  therefore
       whether removal would breach Article 8 ECHR.  Applying Section 117B,
       the Judge could take into account whether  the  Appellant  might  be
       able  to  show  that  she  meets  the  income  threshold  even   if,
       technically, she cannot meet Appendix FM for failure to satisfy  the
       evidential requirements.  As such, Mr Jarvis accepted  that  it  was
       incumbent on the Judge to consider whether the ability to  meet  the
       income threshold  albeit  not  in  compliance  with  the  evidential
       requirements was sufficient to amount to compelling circumstances so
       as to justify allowing the appeal on the basis that removal would be
       disproportionate.


   15. The extent of that concession and  potential  impact  of  the  error
       conceded depends though, at least to some  extent,  on  whether  the
       Appellant's other grounds, dealing with  the  income  threshold  and
       evidential requirements of the  Rules  are  made  out.  I  therefore
       consider those issues before dealing with the effect of the error of
       law which is conceded.


   16. The starting point for the errors asserted in relation to the income
       threshold  is   the   Respondent's   decision.     The   Appellant's
       application is dated 22 September 2015.   She  therefore  needed  to
       show that she or she and  the  Sponsor  together  earned  more  than
       �18,600 in the six months prior to the application.  The most recent
       documents relied upon had to be dated no earlier than 28 days before
       the date of the application.  The Appellant and her  spouse  had  to
       provide six or twelve months of payslips,  a  letter  from  employer
       confirming employment, gross  annual  salary,  length  and  type  of
       employment  and  bank  account  statements  corresponding  with  the
       payslips.


   17. The documents which the Appellant submitted are listed on  page  [4]
       of the refusal letter.  The Appellant had two jobs but, at least  in
       this appeal, relies only on the job working for Bayleaf Cleaning  Co
       ("Bayleaf").  She supplied four payslips for  the  period  March  to
       June 2015 showing a total gross income  of  �3253.25.   The  Sponsor
       works for ISS UK Ltd ("ISS").  In relation to his  employment,  P60s
       were submitted for 2012, 2014 and 2015.  Fortnightly  payslips  were
       supplied for the period 9 January to 26 June 2015 but those were not
       verified.   In  addition,  the  Appellant  submitted  Halifax  joint
       account bank statements for the period 2 February to  21  July  2015
       showing,  it  is  said,  monthly  cash  deposits  of   approximately
       �700/�800 and BACS payments of approximately �250.


   18. It is clear from the foregoing, that the  documents  submitted  with
       the application fell well short of the evidential requirements  both
       in terms of the  period  covered  by  the  documents,  the  type  of
       documents and content of those documents.  The Respondent could  not
       have been expected to  exercise  evidential  flexibility  given  the
       serious deficiencies and that the remedying  of  any  one  of  those
       deficiencies would have made no difference to the outcome.


   19. It is though common ground that the Tribunal is  not  restricted  in
       its consideration of the income  requirements  to  looking  only  at
       documents which were before the  Respondent.   It  is  not  for  the
       Tribunal to exercise the evidential flexibility  which  is  for  the
       decision-maker to apply  but  if  a  Judge  is  satisfied  that  the
       documents produced at the appeal hearing show substantial compliance
       with the evidential requirements as at the date of the  application,
       then Mr Jarvis accepted that a Judge could  "hypothetically"  review
       the  exercise  of  discretion  to  ascertain  whether   the   income
       requirement is satisfied.  I did not understand that  submission  to
       be that a Judge could directly apply the evidential flexibility rule
       which is for the Respondent in order  to  find  that  the  Appellant
       could satisfy the  evidential  requirement  under  the  Rules.   The
       Tribunal no longer possesses the  power  to  find  the  Respondent's
       decision to be "not in accordance with the law" and to  require  her
       to re-take the decision exercising her  discretion.   It  is  though
       relevant to consideration of the human  rights'  claim  outside  the
       Rules, particularly in relation to the weight to  be  given  to  the
       public interest, that an appellant meets the relevant rule.


   20. I turn then to consider how the Judge dealt with this aspect of  the
       Appellant's case in the Decision.   This is dealt with  at  [15]  to
       [17] of the Decision as follows:-


            "[15]      As the appeal is not under the Points-Based  System,
           notwithstanding a requirement to submit supporting documents  as
           at the date of application,  for  example  payslips  covering  a
           period of six months prior to the date of  application,  account
           will be taken of all the documents submitted by the appellant in
           support of the appeal.  These reveal however a failure to comply
           with the mandatory requirement of the Rules.
            [16] At the outset, an examination of the  appellant's  Bayleaf
           employment letter reveals that contrary  to  the  provisions  of
           para 2(b) of Appendix FM-SE no annual salary and  the  level  of
           salary relied upon are recorded.  As to her gross annual  income
           (15(b)(i) of Appendix FM) a consideration [of] the payslips  and
           P60 for the year ended 5 April 2015 reveal an annual  income  of
           �8,364.22 supported by payslips,  a  P60  and  bank  statements.
           Insofar as the sponsor is concerned, despite being in continuing
           employment  with  ISS  up  to  the  date  of   the   appellant's
           application, the payslips produced  in  support  of  the  appeal
           ended on 26 June 2015 revealing an accumulated gross salary with
           effect from 6  April  2015  of  �2,635.20.   [Had  the  payslips
           between  26  June  and  23  September  2015  been  produced  the
           accumulated gross salary would obviously have been higher.]  His
           employment letter compliant with para  2(b)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
           asserts that his annual salary is �11,731.20.  His P60  for  the
           year ended 5 April 2015 records a gross annual taxable income of
           �12,606.80.  Prorated his monthly salary for the tax year  ended
           5 April 2015 is �1,050.56 wherein his accumulated income for the
           period October to March 2015 is �5,252.83 and which added to the
           said sum of �2,635.20 reveals a proved  annual  income  of  only
           �7,888.03.  The sponsor's  proven  annual  income  of  �7,888.03
           added to the  appellant's  proven  annual  income  of  �8,364.22
           results in a grand total [of] �16,252.25 which  obviously  falls
           far short of the minimum of �18,600.
            [17] As the Rules are expressed in mandatory terms the issue of
           discretion does not arise.  As to the appellant herself, she has
           failed  to  submit  a  valid  employment  letter   meeting   the
           requirements of para 2(b) of Appendix FM-SE.  For his  part  the
           sponsor has not submitted payslips  covering  a  period  of  six
           months prior to the  date  of  the  appellant's  application  in
           accordance with para 2(a) of  appendix  FM-SE.   The  result  of
           those failures also means that the appellant does not  meet  the
           minimum threshold of �18,600"


   21. The Appellant's grounds in this regard can be summarised as follows.
        The Judge accepted that the Appellant provided payslips, a P60  and
       bank statements which together showed that she earned  �8,364.22  in
       her employment with Bayleaf over the twelve months' period prior  to
       the date of application.  It is accepted that the Appellant did  not
       produce  a  letter  from  Bayleaf  compliant  with  the   evidential
       requirements.  It is said though either that the other evidence  was
       sufficient to show that she met the  requirements  and/or  that  the
       evidential flexibility  requirements  in  Appendix  FM-SE  D(d)(iii)
       could be applied so that the application  could  have  been  granted
       exceptionally.


   22. In relation to the Sponsor, the error is said to be that  the  Judge
       left out of account payslips which were before him running to August
       2015 which, if taken into account, would have provided  evidence  of
       twelve months' income to satisfy the Rules.  The Sponsor did provide
       a letter from  ISS.   It  is  also  said  that  the  Sponsor's  bank
       statements corroborated the payslips.


   23. The witness statement of the  Sponsor  clearly  refers  to  the  ISS
       payslips from 6 February 2015 to  7  August  2015.   Those  payslips
       disclose a gross salary in that six  months'  period  of  �5,929.20.
       The payslips  are  clearly  in  the  bundle  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.  There is also a letter from ISS which confirms  that  the
       Sponsor remains in permanent part-time employment and  confirms  his
       gross annual salary.  The bank statements are not in  the  paginated
       bundle but are produced separately.  Those show receipts in the same
       period corresponding to the payslips.  The grounds  make  the  point
       that if one works on the figure being �439.20  per  fortnight,  that
       equates to �878.40 per month or  �10,540.80  per  annum.   In  fact,
       given that the Sponsor is paid fortnightly, the calculation  may  be
       slightly different; if one calculates the  gross  annual  salary  by
       extrapolating directly from the payments being made fortnightly, the
       figure is if anything slightly higher (which may  also  account  for
       the  fact  that  the  employer's  letter  refers  to  a  salary   of
       �11,731.20).  Either  way,  though  the  documents  relied  upon  do
       demonstrate that the couple's joint annual income exceeds �18,600.


   24. The Judge therefore clearly left out of account evidence  which  was
       before him.  However, the evidence which was before the Judge cannot
       meet the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE for the following
       reasons.  First, the Appellant has not produced a  letter  from  her
       employer in compliance with Appendix FM-SE.   Although  that  letter
       does confirm the fact of her employment, start date and  the  nature
       of that employment, it confirms her salary only by way of an  hourly
       rate.  Second, although Mr Jarvis submitted  that  the  six  months'
       period  which  needed  to  be  covered  by  the  payslips  and  bank
       statements was from 19 August 2015 dating back to 19 February  2015,
       that appears to be incorrect by reference  to  paragraph  [1(l)]  of
       Appendix FM-SE.  By my calculation, since the application was  dated
       22 September 2015, the period was 25  August  2015  to  25  February
       2015.  The most recent payslip for the Appellant is dated  7  August
       2015.  The most recent account statement for the joint account  ends
       on 10 August 2015.


   25. In relation to the Sponsor,  although  there  were  payslips  dating
       beyond 7 August 2015, which confirmed that he continued to  be  paid
       at the same rate up to date  of  application  and  although  he  did
       produce an employer's letter which complied with the requirements of
       Appendix FM-SE, the  bank  account  credits  which  corroborate  the
       payslips are to his sole bank account and not to an account in joint
       names with the Appellant.  There is no  evidence  that  the  amounts
       paid in are paid out during the period and  credited  to  the  joint
       account.  For that reason, the documents relating to the Sponsor  do
       not comply either with the strict evidential requirements.


   26. I can for that reason deal succinctly with Mr  Slatter's  submission
       that, since the Appellant could rely on paragraph 13(b) of  Appendix
       FM-SE in place of paragraph 13(a), there was no requirement for  the
       employer's letter for the Appellant to be  produced.   I  prefer  Mr
       Jarvis' submission in any event that  reliance  on  paragraph  13(b)
       does not obviate the need to produce a compliant  employer's  letter
       but, since the evidence in relation to the  Sponsor  also  fails  to
       comply with the evidential requirements, the  deficiencies  are  not
       limited to that employer's letter.


   27. That also disposes of the evidential flexibility point.  As  I  have
       already indicated, I do not accept that it is for me to exercise the
       discretion which the Rules provide in that regard and the Respondent
       was clearly entitled to exercise the discretion as she  did  at  the
       time of  her  decision.   However,  since  there  are  a  number  of
       deficiencies in the evidence, there could be no reason in any  event
       to exercise that flexibility in relation to  the  employer's  letter
       because the application would still fail for other reasons.


   28. For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that there is no  material
       error of law in relation to the Judge's findings as regards  whether
       the Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  could  meet  Appendix  FM  and  in
       particular Appendix FM-SE.   As I have  already  indicated,  though,
       there is an error conceded in relation to the Article 8  assessment.
       I have also accepted that the documents show  that  the  Appellant's
       and the Sponsor's joint income exceeds �18,600.   That  is  material
       and relevant to the Article 8 assessment.


   29. I therefore set aside the Decision.  I indicated at the hearing that
       I proposed to take this course, certainly in relation to  Article  8
       ECHR.  Both representatives accepted that there was no need for  the
       appeal to be remitted. Both  representatives  were  content  that  I
       should re-make the decision on the basis of the documents before me.
        However, Mr Slatter did ask that, if I found there to be  no  error
       of law in relation to compliance with Appendix FM-SE, the  Appellant
       be given a further opportunity to provide evidence  in  relation  to
       what would be the insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing
       in Somalia, having regard also to the need to consider Article 8  on
       the basis of up-to-date information.


   30. No application was made by the Appellant to adduce further evidence.
        In light of my decision below, I did not consider it  necessary  to
       call for further evidence.


    Re-Making of Decision


   31. It is accepted that the Appellant and the Sponsor are in  a  genuine
       and subsisting relationship.  The Appellant  came  to  the  UK  with
       entry clearance as a spouse.  She did not enter under any pretext or
       seek to circumvent immigration control.  As such, she also came here
       with the expectation that she would in due course be able to  remain
       as the spouse of the Sponsor.  The Appellant did overstay her  leave
       by 28 days but that is because  an  application  made  in  time  was
       rejected as invalid.  She has not  flouted  immigration  laws  other
       than in relation to that short  period  of  overstaying  before  her
       valid application  and  she  had  attempted  to  comply  by  earlier
       applications.  The period is in any event short.


   32. On the other hand, the Appellant and the Sponsor  do  not  meet  the
       strict requirements of the Rules.  True it is that I  have  accepted
       that they can now show that at the date of  the  application,  their
       joint income exceeded the minimum income requirement but I have  not
       accepted that the couple can meet the  Rules  because  the  evidence
       which they have produced to demonstrate compliance still falls short
       of meeting the evidential requirements of those Rules.


   33. Even though the Appellant does not meet the eligibility  requirement
       in relation to income because of the evidential failures, she  could
       still meet Appendix FM if she  were  able  to  show  that  paragraph
       EX.1.1.(b) applies.  However, I agree with what  is  said  by  Judge
       Callow at [18] of the Decision.  There has been no  attempt  by  the
       Appellant and the Sponsor to show that there are any  obstacles  let
       alone any insurmountable ones to  them  continuing  family  life  in
       Somalia. I note that there is no evidence  that  the  Sponsor  is  a
       recognised refugee from that country.


   34. The Appellant cannot therefore qualify for leave to remain based  on
       her family life applying Appendix FM.  I turn therefore to  consider
       her claim outside the Rules.


   35. The genuine and subsisting relationship between  the  Appellant  and
       the Sponsor engages Article 8 in relation to their family life  (and
       also their private lives but I do not need to deal with that issue).
        There will be a sufficiently serious interference with  the  family
       life of both  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  occasioned  by  the
       Appellant's removal whether or not the Sponsor chooses to return  to
       Somalia   with   her.    That   interference   therefore    requires
       justification.  There is no doubt that the Respondent's decision  to
       refuse to allow the Appellant to remain is one  which  accords  with
       the law.  The issue is whether  that  decision  is  a  proportionate
       response.


   36. As recently restated by the Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) and others
       v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 10  ("MM"),
       the starting point is that a state has the right to control who  may
       enter and remain in that state.  Under the ECHR, there is no general
       obligation to respect a couple's choice where they would  prefer  to
       enjoy their family life.  That is the more so when, as  here,  there
       are no obstacles to the couple enjoying family life in  the  country
       from which they both originate.


   37. The Supreme Court has recently recognised in  Agyarko  and  Ikuga  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11  that,  in
       the assessment of a claim based on  family  and  private  life,  the
       Rules are to be given considerable weight as  reflecting  where  the
       Secretary of State considers the balance to be struck in the  public
       interest.   This also finds recognition in the requirement placed on
       this Tribunal to have regard to the factors  in  Section  117B,  the
       first of which is that  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
       control is in the public interest.  As such, if an appellant  cannot
       satisfy the requirements under  the  Immigration  Rules,  that  will
       generally favour the public interest in removal.


   38. Although in MM, the Supreme Court held  that  some  aspects  of  the
       Rules and Home Office instructions in relation to the application of
       the minimum income requirement were unlawful or  required  revision,
       in general they recognised  that  the  Respondent  was  entitled  to
       specify a minimum income threshold and to require that threshold  to
       be met provided that an overly rigid approach  was  not  adopted  by
       decision makers.   The  need  to  ensure  that,  in  general,  those
       permitted to remain are able to support themselves is also reflected
       in Section 117B(3) that financial independence of such persons is in
       the public interest.


   39. I take into account  though  at  this  point  my  finding  that  the
       evidence shows that the couple in  fact  earned  in  excess  of  the
       minimum income threshold.  I of course give weight to the fact  that
       the evidence they produce does not meet the evidential  requirements
       of the Rules and that those evidential requirements are there for  a
       purpose to ensure that applicants are able to demonstrate by  cogent
       evidence that they meet the requirements.  However,  although  there
       are a number of deficiencies in the evidence in terms of  compliance
       with those requirements, none  is  substantial,  whether  considered
       singly or cumulatively.


   40. The letter from  the  Appellant's  employer  provides  most  of  the
       information to confirm her employment and that  is  corroborated  by
       the payslips.  Although the letter refers to earnings  based  on  an
       hourly rate and not a gross annual salary, the payslips  do  show  a
       consistent level of earnings by the  Appellant  over  the  requisite
       period (albeit that period falls short by about two weeks  from  the
       evidential requirements under the Rules).  The amounts shown in  the
       payslips are corroborated by matching credits in the bank statements
       which are to a joint account.


   41. In relation to the Sponsor, his  payslips  show  that  he  has  been
       working for some time in the same job, working a  consistent  number
       of hours and earning broadly the same amount. He has  also  produced
       payslips and bank statements within the period required as  well  as
       an employer's  letter  which  confirms  his  employment.   The  main
       difficulty with the evidence in relation to the Sponsor is that  his
       wages are paid into an account in his sole name.  However, there  is
       no dispute as to the relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  the
       Sponsor.  It appears from the bank statements submitted in  relation
       to both the joint and sole account that both are  used  for  general
       household  expenses.   Both  show  credit  balances  throughout  the
       period.


   42. I am satisfied on the  evidence  that  the  couple  are  financially
       independent and moreover that they jointly earn  in  excess  of  the
       minimum income threshold requirements of the Rules albeit  that  the
       evidence they produce does not satisfy the evidential  requirements.
       I am able to give weight to those factors in their favour.  That  is
       not to apply any "near miss" principle.  It is simply  to  recognise
       that it is one factor in the  balancing  equation  in  their  favour
       under Article 8 that they are able to show that they, in fact,  earn
       an amount which exceeds the level which the Respondent  requires  to
       be shown.


   43.  Although  the  Appellant  has  not  shown  that   there   are   any
       insurmountable obstacles to  her  relationship  being  continued  on
       return to Somalia, I do bear in mind that, if the Appellant and  the
       Sponsor  had   overcome   the   evidential   deficiencies   in   the
       documentation produced to support their application, leave to remain
       would have  been  granted.   Failure  to  meet  the  minimum  income
       threshold is the reason given for the Respondent's  refusal  of  the
       application on eligibility grounds. As such, this is  one  of  those
       very unusual cases where there is some certainty to  an  application
       for entry clearance succeeding - as indeed it did in 2012.


   44. It is also relevant to the weight to be given  to  the  family  life
       versus public interest balance that the  couple's  relationship  has
       been continued in the UK while both have been here lawfully.  I also
       take  into  account  that,  although  the  Sponsor  originates  from
       Somalia,  he  is  a  British  citizen.   That  is  by  no  means   a
       determinative factor  but  it  is  something  to  be  factored  into
       account.  The Appellant would have needed to satisfy the  Respondent
       that she speaks English to a sufficient standard in order to  obtain
       entry clearance as a spouse although I do note that she required  an
       interpreter in order to give evidence  at  the  hearing  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal.


   45. This case  is  finely  balanced.   On  the  positive  side  for  the
       Appellant, she has observed immigration laws and  sought  to  comply
       with immigration control at every step.  She has been here  lawfully
       and her family life has been developed against a backdrop of  lawful
       residence. That reduces the weight which needs to be  given  to  the
       maintenance of effective immigration control in her case.   However,
       she could not and on the basis of the evidence available  before  me
       still has not met the requirement of the Rules.  That would tend  to
       favour  the  public  interest  in  removal.   However,  as  I   have
       explained, the weight is reduced by reason of the nature and  extent
       of the reasons why the Appellant is unable to meet the  Rules.   She
       has demonstrated on the evidence that, in fact, she and the  Sponsor
       jointly earned in excess of the minimum income threshold at the date
       of  application.   They  have  shown  that  they   are   financially
       independent.  Having carefully balanced the factors for and against,
       I am satisfied that, by reason of the exceptional factors at play in
       this case, the Respondent's decision to refuse the  Appellant  leave
       is a disproportionate interference with her Article  8  rights.   It
       follows that removal would breach the Appellant's human  rights.   I
       therefore allow the appeal.

DECISION
    I am satisfied that the Decision contains material errors of  law.  The
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow promulgated  on  21  April
    2017 is set aside.
    I re-make the decision and I allow the appeal on human  rights  grounds
    on the basis that removal of the Appellant would breach Article 8 ECHR.
