     4. The offence that led to the decision to deport the  appellant  from
        the United Kingdom is that for which he was convicted on 25  August
        2011. In his sentencing remarks of 25 August 2011 HHJ Milmo stated:


             Ahmed Pelle is  18.  He  has  a  Facebook  account  with  2000
             friends. On three occasions between Saturday 6th and Wednesday
             10th August he posted three. First,  "kill  one  black  youth;
             will kill a million  feds;  riot  till  we  own  the  cities."
             Second, "Notts riot, who's on it?"  Third,  "Rioting  tonight;
             anyone want something from Flannels?".


             On arrest you suggested it was all a joke.  In  interview  you
             frankly conceded that you wanted the riots to  continue  as  a
             demonstration by black youths  against  authority,  government
             and police so, to quote your own words, "the police  can't  do
             nothing to us no more."


             You wanted to follow Shank so that youth would take  over  the
             streets so  that  government,  police  and  society  could  do
             nothing. That is a recipe for anarchy.


             You wanted to encourage the continuing rioting  in  the  major
             cities  of  this  country;  blowing  up  police  stations  and
             government property and shutting them down.


             You thought your posts might have encouraged people to do what
             they wanted to do  anyway;  interestingly,  a  number  of  the
             comments posted confirmed that they thought that  you  were  a
             stupid idiot. The problem is that others may have  taken  your
             comments seriously.


             You pleaded guilty  to  sending  three  messages  on  Facebook
             inciting  contact  to  join  and  violent  disorder,  not,   I
             emphasise, riot.  I  understand  the  Chester  cases  involved
             inciting contact to join in riot.


             I have read the community impact statement  by  Superintendent
             Walker which evidences the extent of the  public  disorder  on
             the streets of Nottingham over the  48  hours  prior  to  10th
             August. What is particularly significant is  the  emphasis  he
             places on cooperation which the local police received from all
             the local communities.


             The  seriousness  of  what   you   did   was   to   encourage,
             indiscriminately, those who are minded to  take  part  in  the
             violence and those who  were  not  but  who,  on  seeing  your
             comments, might have changed their minds. I am satisfied  that
             was your intention.


             What you encouraged was not an attack on  an  individual,  but
             attacks on the people of Nottingham as a whole and the  people
             of other cities. Fortunately, those living in this city  were,
             for the most part, too sensible to follow your lead. You  went
             to the extent of posting a profile picture of boxes  of  Vans,
             Lacoste, Fred Perry and Adidas trainers, intending  people  to
             believe that you had looted them.  You  said  later,  which  I
             fully accept, that you had bought  them  legitimately  out  of
             your jobseekers allowance.


             I pay  particular  regard  to  the  harm  this  offence  could
             foreseeably have caused; clearly it was designed to and  could
             well have led to increased numbers on  the  street  intent  on
             violence to persons and property.


     5. The Judge notes when considering the appellants background that  he
        claimed to have come to the UK from Cuba with his  mother  and  two
        brothers when he was only 3 years of age. This  reference  to  Cuba
        has  been  a  consistent  theme  throughout  the  appellant's  case
        including providing a copy of a grant of Indefinite Leave to Remain
        (ILR) a number of years ago in which  the  appellant's  nationality
        was described as 'Cuban'.
     6.  Before  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  appellant  provided  a  written
        statement described as "Further Grounds of Appeal" in the following
        terms:


             With respect for the authority at the Immigration  and  Asylum
             First-Tier Tribunal.


             With respect the law and justice with respect for  the  Geneva
             Convention and respect for the human rights.


             I am not prepared to accept the Home Office decision to deport
             me fraudulently to Romania with a false  identity  alleged  by
             the Home Office because I have some criminal offences  in  the
             UK and because I have some Romanian friends  on  the  Facebook
             social media.


             I have the human rights to make friends no matter what  colour
             or what nationality they are no one  shall  violate  my  human
             rights.


             I'm not prepared to accept my illegal deportation  to  Romania
             and no misdirection in law or  wrong  exercise  of  discretion
             because Romania is not my country of origin  and  because  the
             Home Office they don't have any evidence  about  me  to  prove
             that I am a Romanian citizen.


             I am not a Romanian citizen I was not born in Romania I'm  not
             registered in Romania I never put my foot in Romania  I  don't
             speak Romanian language and I have nothing to do with Romania.


             I have negative  feelings  about  my  illegal  deportation  to
             Romania because of the illegal matter and irregular  documents
             enter into Romanian border.


             I am prosecuted because of the human rights,  race,  religion,
             nationality and political opinion.


             I'm unwell to travel fraudulently to Romania  or  any  foreign
             country where my life and freedom will be  threatened  in  the
             account of my race religion nationality and political opinion.


             The Home Office shall not deport me fraudulently to Romania or
             any foreign country as  there  may  be  causing  of  political
             matter and tension between  States  according  to  the  Geneva
             Convention act 1951.


             My removal and my illegal deportation will be contrary to  the
             UK obligations under the human rights  Convention  and  Geneva
             Convention as there is a strong  likelihood  that  I  will  be
             subjected to return to the UK if the  Home  Office  deport  me
             fraudulently to Romanian or any foreign countries.


             I have claim asylum in the UK on 17 December 1996 and this  is
             the UK obligations under the refugees Convention to protect me
             in the UK and not too endanger my life.


             The Home  Office  they  have  granted  me  and  my  family  UK
             immigration status indefinite leave to remain in  the  UK  and
             permanent   resident   granted   exceptionally   outside   the
             immigration rules and outside the international obligations.


             I do not need to travel or be emigrated abroad.


             The Home Office should forgive me for my criminal offences and
             for the mistakes that I have done because I was young aged and
             because I did not realise what I have done.


             The Home Office should offer me help instead of endangering my
             life.


             The Home Office should agree to let me stay in the UK  because
             all my family they are living in the UK because I don't have a
             country of origin to return to.


             My mother she is mentally ill she was diagnosed with psychosis
             paranoid schizophrenia in the UK in 2010 needs  treatment  for
             the rest of her life and she recently had an operation to  the
             liver she had the  gallbladder  removed  and  she  is  feeling
             unwell I'm not prepared to accept the Home Office decision  to
             travel fraudulently to Romania or any foreign countries or  to
             leave my family behind.


             I have been living in the UK from the age of 3.


             I have been studying in the UK from 1997 to 2011  and  I  have
             learned the British culture for almost 23 years I  don't  know
             other countries apart from the UK.


             I'm afraid to return to my country of origin because  I  don't
             have one.


             I therefore ask  to  the  immigration  and  asylum  first-Tier
             Tribunal and to the Secretary of State to consider  my  appeal
             to stay in the UK in light of the Geneva Convention  act  1951
             and under the relevant human rights act  1998  because  of  my
             political  reasons  because  of  my  humanitarian  reason  and
             because I'm in danger of dying if the Home  Office  deport  me
             fraudulently to Romania or any foreign countries.


     7. The statement is signed by Mr Ahmed Pelle the  name  by  which  the
        appellant currently wishes to be known.
     8. The respondent in the reasons  for  deportation  letter  refers  to
        further submissions made by the appellant as to why he  should  not
        be deported from the United Kingdom. In relation to the appellant's
        nationality the respondent writes at [4]:


             "The Home Office  have  concluded  that  you  are  a  Romanian
             national by descent as your mother Maria [M] (nee  [F])  is  a
             Romanian national. Following the removal  of  your  family  to
             Cuba on the 7 July 2001 you were returned to the UK as you had
             not been accepted as Cuban nationals, as you had  claimed,  by
             the  Cuban  authorities.  Whilst  interviewed  by  the   Cuban
             authorities your mother stated her true name was Maria [M],  a
             Romanian national and your name was Isaac [J] also a  Romanian
             national. Examination of open source social media  sites  have
             revealed that Suzelle Pelle and Maria [M] (nee  [F])  are  one
             and the same person and that you  operate  your  own  accounts
             under the name of Isaac Pelle. Examination  of  these  sources
             have revealed an extended family who conversed in Romanian."


     9. In addition the First-Tier Tribunal in the  determination  of  25th
        May 2018 noted  there  was  a  dispute  regarding  the  appellant's
        nationality and therefore the country to which he would be deported
        if  his  appeal  was  not  successful.  At  [3]  of   the   earlier
        determination, which is not a finding affected  by  the  conclusion
        that Tribunal had erred in law, it is written:


             "Mr Petryszyn referred me to the evidential  report  contained
             at pages C1 to C3 of the Respondent's bundle. I do not propose
             to repeat  all  the  evidence  that  is  set  out  there.  The
             Respondent  has  taken  account  there  of   the   Appellant's
             complicated family background and of the fact that his  mother
             has claimed on different occasions that she and her sons  were
             Cuban nationals or  Romanian  nationals.  The  Respondent  has
             concluded that the Appellant is a Romanian national by descent
             from his mother, and that his true name is Isaac [J] and  that
             his date of birth is 15 January 1993. Although  I  accept  the
             Appellants evidence that he believes he was born  in  Germany,
             that would not, of itself, make him a German citizen. I  found
             on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that   the   Respondent's
             conclusions about the Appellant's identity were correct."


    10. The First-Tier Tribunal proceeded on the basis the appellant  is  a
        Romanian national with  the  above  date  of  birth.  Although  the
        appellant denies  he  is  Romanian  the  weight  of  the  evidence,
        including the above unappealed finding, enables  this  Tribunal  to
        proceed on the  basis  the  respondent  was  entitled  to  issue  a
        deportation order pursuant to the EEA Regulations on the  basis  of
        the appellant's Romanian nationality.
    11. The First-Tier  Tribunal  finding  in  relation  to  the  level  of
        protection to which  the  appellant  is  entitled  to  is  also  an
        unchallenged finding.   The  First-Tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
        appellant had not acquired a right of permanent  residence  in  the
        United Kingdom and is therefore only entitled to the lower level of
        protection, namely that his removal is justified on the grounds  of
        public policy, public security or public health. This  remains  the
        situation before the Upper Tribunal.
    12. Regulation  27(5)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
        Regulations 2016 ('the 2016 Regulations') states the public  policy
        and public security requirements  of  the  United  Kingdom  include
        restricting rights otherwise  conferred  by  these  Regulations  in
        order to protect the fundamental interests of society and  where  a
        relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy  or  public
        security it shall, (in addition to  complying  with  the  preceding
        paragraphs of the regulation,) be  taken  in  accordance  with  the
        following principles-
        (a) the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;
        (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal  conduct
        of the person concerned;
        (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must  represent  a
        genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
        the fundamental interests  of  society  taking  into  account  past
        conduct of the person and that the  threat  does  not  need  to  be
        imminent;
        (d) matters isolated from the particulars  of  the  case  or  which
        relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify  the
        decision;
        (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not  in  themselves
        justify the decision
        (f) the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even in  the
        absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the grounds are
        specific to the person.
    13. Regulation 27(6) states that before taking a relevant  decision  on
        the grounds of public policy or public security in  relation  to  a
        person who is resident in the United  Kingdom  the  decision  maker
        must take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,  state  of
        health, family and economic situation of the person,  the  person's
        length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social  and
        cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of  the
        person's links with his country of origin.
    14. Regulation 27(8) of the 2016  regulations  says  that  a  court  or
        tribunal considering whether the requirements  of  this  regulation
        are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to  the  considerations
        contained in Schedule 1 (considerations of  public  policy,  public
        security and the fundamental interests of society etc).
    15. Schedule 1 provides:


        SCHEDULE 1


        CONSIDERATIONS  OF  PUBLIC  POLICY,   PUBLIC   SECURITY   AND   THE
        FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ETC.


        Considerations of public policy and public security


        1.  The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform scale of public  policy
        or  public  security  values:  member  States  enjoy   considerable
        discretion, acting within the parameters set by  the  EU  Treaties,
        applied where relevant by the EEA agreement, to  define  their  own
        standards of  public  policy  and  public  security,  for  purposes
        tailored to their individual contexts, from time to time.


        Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom


        2.  An EEA national or the family member of an EEA national  having
        extensive familial and societal links  with  persons  of  the  same
        nationality or language does  not  amount  to  integration  in  the
        United Kingdom; a significant degree of wider cultural and societal
        integration must be present before a  person  may  be  regarded  as
        integrated in the United Kingdom.
        3.  Where an EEA national or the family member of an  EEA  national
        has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent offender, the
        longer the sentence, or the  more  numerous  the  convictions,  the
        greater the likelihood that the individual's continued presence  in
        the United Kingdom represents a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
        serious threat affecting of the fundamental interests of society.
        4.  Little weight is to be attached to the integration  of  an  EEA
        national or the family member of an EEA national within the  United
        Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at  or  around
        the same time as-
        (a) the commission of a criminal offence;
        (b)  an  act  otherwise  affecting  the  fundamental  interests  of
        society;
        (c) the EEA national or family member of an  EEA  national  was  in
        custody.
        5.  The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national  or  the
        family member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive
        evidence of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for  example,  through
        demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of an  EEA
        national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
        to be proportionate.
        6.  It  is  consistent  with  public  policy  and  public  security
        requirements in the United Kingdom that EEA decisions may be  taken
        in order to refuse,  terminate  or  withdraw  any  right  otherwise
        conferred by these Regulations in the case of abuse  of  rights  or
        fraud, including-
        (a) entering, attempting to enter or assisting  another  person  to
        enter or to attempt to enter,  a  marriage,  civil  partnership  or
        durable partnership of convenience; or
        (b) fraudulently obtaining or attempting  to  obtain  or  assisting
        another to obtain or to attempt to obtain, a right to reside  under
        these Regulations.


        The fundamental interests of society


        7.   For  the  purposes  of  these  Regulations,  the   fundamental
        interests of society in the United Kingdom include-


        (a)  preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of  the  immigration
        laws, and  maintaining  the  integrity  and  effectiveness  of  the
        immigration control system (including under these Regulations)  and
        of the Common Travel Area;
        (b) maintaining public order;
        (c)preventing social harm;
        (d)preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;
        (e)protecting public services;
        (f)excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of an EEA
        national with a conviction (including where  the  conduct  of  that
        person is likely to cause, or has in fact caused,  public  offence)
        and maintaining public confidence in the ability  of  the  relevant
        authorities to take such action;
        (g)tackling offences likely to  cause  harm  to  society  where  an
        immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify  but  where
        there is wider societal harm  (such  as  offences  related  to  the
        misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension as mentioned
        in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the  European
        Union);
        (h)combating the effects of persistent offending  (particularly  in
        relation to offences, which if taken in isolation, may otherwise be
        unlikely to meet the requirements of regulation 27);
        (i)protecting the rights and freedoms of others, particularly  from
        exploitation and trafficking;
        (j)protecting the public;
        (k)acting in the best interests of a child (including  where  doing
        so entails refusing a child admission to  the  United  Kingdom,  or
        otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);
        (l)countering terrorism and extremism and protecting shared values.




Discussion



    16. The decision to deport was  clearly  taken  on  the  basis  of  the
        appellant's personal conduct evidenced by  the  commission  of  the
        offence that led to his sentence on 25th August 2011.  Inciting  or
        encouraging others to commit violence to persons  and  property  is
        clearly contrary to the fundamental values of the United Kingdom.
    17. The First-Tier Tribunal Judge  noted  that  this  offence  was  the
        appellant's first and by far the most  serious  with  gaps  in  his
        offending history. The First-Tier Tribunal also recorded  that  the
        appellant admitted the offences for which  he  had  been  convicted
        were only those for which he had been caught. When asked during the
        course of his evidence before the Upper Tribunal roughly  how  many
        other offences he had committed it is clear  from  the  appellant's
        reply that he is a  prolific  offender  who  has  embarked  upon  a
        systematic campaign of theft since his very early days  at  school.
        Although the appellant claimed that as a result of  his  upbringing
        he would steal food and other necessities this  cannot  provide  an
        explanation for all his offending. Indeed the  First-Tier  Tribunal
        noted at [17] of the earlier decision:


             17.  He has not been working since 2017. Instead he  has  been
                  doing a course of flying lessons. He has been  paying  for
                  his own flying lessons, which is why  he  has  a  criminal
                  record since 2011. Basically,  he  has  been  funding  his
                  lessons by shoplifting. He  said  that  the  fact  he  was
                  struggling to fund the  lessons  was  no  excuse  for  his
                  behaviour.


    18. The appellant's methodology is also sophisticated. His  convictions
        for fraud are as a result of stealing goods and  then  taking  them
        back to the same shop to try and obtain a cash refund, on occasions
        forging receipts to make it appear that the goods had been  validly
        purchased. The appellant's evidence was that was the basis for  his
        most recent conviction and period of imprisonment.
    19. It is quite clear from the appellants evidence that he  resorts  to
        acts of criminality to fund his activities. The appellant's history
        shows he has worked when he was able to earn  an  income,  but  the
        history of criminality  shows  he  presents  a  real  risk  of  the
        commission of further offences if no lawful  source  of  income  is
        available to him. The number of actual  offences  committed  is  in
        excess of 100.
    20. I find the respondent has discharged the burden upon  him  to  show
        the appellant's personal conduct represents a genuine, present  and
        sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
        interests of society  taking  into  account  past  conduct  of  the
        appellant  and  high-level  probability  of   continued   acts   of
        criminality in the future.
    21. The prolific nature of the appellant's offending also gives rise to
        the question of the applicability of preventative grounds  for  his
        deportation too.
    22. In relation to the proportionality of the decision, it is clear the
        appellant has integrated into the United  Kingdom  the  country  in
        which he has grown up and been educated.
    23. The appellant, based upon the finding  his  date  of  birth  is  15
        January 1993, is 26 years of age.
    24. There is no evidence the appellant suffers physical or  mental  ill
        health.
    25. The appellant lives with his mother and two brothers in  Nottingham
        having no  independent  home  of  his  own.  The  appellant's  twin
        brother, who the First-Tier Tribunal Judge  recorded  was  studying
        but in Birmingham, has in  fact  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
        imprisonment and is still in prison at the date of the  appellant's
        hearing before the Upper Tribunal.
    26. Although the appellant  has  worked  in  the  past  the  First-Tier
        Tribunal noted he had not worked since 2017 and his criminal record
        shows his arrest and serving of a further  period  of  imprisonment
        mean he will not have worked since. The appellant's evidence was he
        was looking for a job and that he was studying media at  Bournville
        College twice a week and enjoys the same but evidence of  that  was
        extremely limited beyond the appellant's oral evidence.
    27. The appellant has been resident in the United Kingdom since aged  3
        with his social and  cultural  integration  only  being  broken  by
        periods of imprisonment.
    28. The appellant claims to have no links with Romania  although  there
        is evidence of the same through the electronic media referred to by
        the respondent in the reasons for refusal letter.  It is  not  made
        out the appellant has no contact with extended family in Romania or
        that he could not turn to them for assistance  when  deported  from
        the United Kingdom. It is  not  made  out  the  appellant  will  be
        abandoned on return or become destitute.
    29. In relation to the appellant's mother  the  appellant  claimed  his
        mother suffers from mental health problems which is  not  disputed.
        The appellant has served two periods of  imprisonment  and  is  not
        made out his mother's situation deteriorated to the extent that she
        could not manage and function without the appellant. It is not made
        out the appellant does anything of a substantial nature  to  assist
        his mother and that whilst his presence may be of  comfort  to  her
        she did not  prevent  the  appellant  offending  in  an  escalating
        manner.  It was not established  the  emotional  ties  between  the
        appellant and his mother include  an  element  of  dependency.  The
        appellant's mother has received treatment and has a care worker who
        assists in managing her depression and that  her  schizophrenia  is
        controlled by medication which has continued during the appellant's
        absence as a result of his imprisonment.
    30. Existence of family in the UK has  clearly  not  been  a  deterrent
        factor to the appellant. In 2018 before the First-Tier Tribunal the
        appellant claimed he would take responsibility for his actions  and
        indicated that he will not offend in the future leading  the  Judge
        on that occasion to believe the  appellant's  claim  that  he  will
        change;  shortly  after  which  the  appellant  was  arrested   and
        convicted before the Chester Crown Court for which  he  received  a
        further period of imprisonment for similar offences  of  dishonesty
        to those he committed in the past.
    31. In relation to the issue of rehabilitation, whilst it  is  accepted
        it will be difficult for the  appellant  to  establish  himself  in
        Romania, a country which will appear alien  to  him,  he  fails  to
        establish on the evidence that any problems will be  insurmountable
        such as to make his deportation disproportionate on the facts.  The
        appellant  has  provided  no  evidence  that  has  undertaken   any
        rehabilitative work in the UK of his own initiative any  such  work
        having been undertaken as a result of the condition of a  Community
        Order although the fact the appellant has continued  to  offend  is
        clear evidence that he has not  become  rehabilitated  and  is  and
        remains a persistent offender.
    32. It was not made out the appellant would not be able to work towards
        rehabilitation in Romania or that  if  contact  is  made  with  the
        relevant authorities that his deportation would not  prejudice  the
        prospects of rehabilitation.
    33. Considering the  appellant's  immigration  history,  real  risk  of
        continued reoffending  in  the  future,  the  genuine  present  and
        sufficiently serious threat the appellant poses to at least one  of
        the fundamental interests of the United Kingdom, having  regard  to
        the proportionality of the decision in  light  of  the  appellant's
        personal circumstances, I find that the decision to deport pursuant
        to the EEA Regulations 2016 is proportionate in accordance with the
        principles of regulations 27(5) and (6).
    34. The appellant makes a claim pursuant to the Refugee Convention  but
        fails to establish any real risk of harm for a Convention reason if
        removed to Romania where he has never experienced any such risk  in
        the past and fails to properly make out any reason why he should be
        at risks sufficient to entitle him  to  a  grant  of  international
        protection even if he has  little  experience  of  living  in  that
        country, especially in light of the  assistance  that  he  has  not
        shown will not be available from extended family members there. The
        appellant fails to make out an entitlement to be  recognised  as  a
        refugee, to a grant of Humanitarian protection, or  leave  pursuant
        to articles 2 or 3 ECHR.
    35. In relation to appellants article 8 ECHR claim, the  appellant  has
        private life in the United Kingdom based upon his time  in  the  UK
        and integration including his education and relationship  with  his
        mother and brothers all of whom reside in  the  UK.  The  appellant
        does not have a child and has not established family  life  with  a
        partner in the UK sufficient to entitle him to satisfy an exception
        set out in paragraphs 399(a) or 399(b) of the Immigration Rules.
    36. Considering whether the appellant has established  very  compelling
        circumstances  which  outweigh   the   public   interest   in   his
        deportation, such that it would  be  disproportionate  pursuant  to
        article 8 ECHR, the appellant fails to  establish  very  compelling
        circumstances sufficient to outweigh the  public  interest  in  his
        deportation.
    37. The appellant's claim in his further ground that his  removal  will
        be a breach of a protected right  is  not  made  out  as  any  such
        interference is proportionate to the public interest which includes
        the protection of those within the  United  Kingdom  from  criminal
        acts, the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, and  the  fact
        the appellant's deportation has  been  shown  to  be  proportionate
        pursuant to the EEA Regulations 2016.


Decision

    38. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.

   Anonymity.


    39. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
