Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr. Z. Malik, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr. L. Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are citizens of India.  They are husband and wife.  They
    entered the United Kingdom on 23 June 2004  with  a  valid  visit  visa
    which expired on 4 December  2004.   They  did  not  leave  the  United
    Kingdom before their leave expired and remained  illegally,  taking  no
    steps to regularise their immigration status until December  2011  when
    they made an application for discretionary leave  to  remain.   It  was
    refused in a decision dated 30 July 2013 and decisions were then  taken
    to remove them from the United Kingdom in accordance with Section 10 of
    the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 2. The appellants' appealed and following a hearing before  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Harrington their appeals were dismissed under  both
    the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Nicholson on  8  May  2014.   His  reasons  are  as
    follows:-

         "1.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Harrington dismissed the appellants'
             appeals against refusal to vary leave and removal to India  in
             a determination promulgated on 26 March 2014.

         2.   The appellants were overstayers.  They applied  for  leave  to
             remain under Article 8 outside of  the  Rules  before  9  July
             2012.  The respondent refused the applications on the  grounds
             that they did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE or
             Appendix FM of the new Rules.

         3.   The grounds contend that the judge should have found that that
             decision was not in accordance with the law.

         4.   In Edghill v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 402, at  paragraph  33,  the
             Court of Appeal indicated that where an application  was  made
             before 9  July  2012  and  refused  under  Article  8  by  the
             respondent solely by reference  to  the  new  Rules  then  the
             decision was not in accordance with the law.

         5.   Given the judge's clear factual findings and bearing  in  mind
             that it is a criminal offence to overstay under Section 24  of
             the 1971 Act, it may well be that these appeals have little if
             any prospect of success.  Nonetheless, in  the  light  of  the
             decision by the Court of  Appeal  the  grounds  are  arguable.
             Permission to appeal is accordingly granted."

    Thus the appeal came before me today.

 4. Mr. Malik relied on one ground, namely, that the  immigration  decision
    that triggered the appeal was not in accordance with the law  and  that
    the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in not finding so and in  assuming
    that the answer to the third question of  R  (Razgar)  v  Secretary  of
    State [2004] UKHL 24 is in the affirmative.

 5. The respondent refused  the  appellant's  Article  8  claim  solely  by
    reference to paragraph 276ADE under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules HC 395 (as amended).  This, Mr.  Malik  contended,  was  unlawful
    because paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM were part of HC194  which  was
    laid before Parliament under Section 3(2) of the Immigration  Act  1971
    on 13 June  2012.   Therein,  under  the  heading  "Implementation"  it
    states:-

         "... the changes set out in this Statement shall take effect  on  9
         July 2012 ...

         However, if an application for entry clearance, leave to remain  or
         indefinite leave to remain has been made before 9 July 2012 and the
         application has not been decided, it will be decided in  accordance
         with the Rules in force on 8 July 2012".

 6. I was directed  to  two  conflicting  authorities.   Firstly,  that  of
    Edghill and Bhoyroo [2014] EWCA Civ 402.  In short, Mr. Malik contended
    that the respondent's decision here, following this  authority  was  an
    unlawful one.

 7. He distinguished the authority of Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA  Civ  558  on
    the basis that  Edghill  had  not  been  cited  therein  and  that  the
    implementation provisions had not been drawn to the  attention  of  the
    court.  Haleemudeen comes to the opposite conclusion on  the  issue  to
    that decided in Edghill.

 8. Mr. Tarlow resisted the application arguing that in any  event  as  the
    appellants' Article 8  claims  had  such  little  merit  in  them,  and
    accordingly little prospect of success, the error made by the judge  in
    the First-tier  was not material.

 9. At the hearing I indicated to the parties that it was my  intention  to
    follow the authority of Edghill.  Whilst I took account of Mr  Tarlow's
    submission I felt in the  circumstances  that  I  could  attach  little
    weight to it.  These appellants' applications were made before  9  July
    2012 and decided after, so they are entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the
    transitional provisions in the  amendments  to  the  Immigration  Rules
    which came into effect on 9 July 2012.

10. Accordingly, I set aside the First-tier  Tribunal's  determination  and
    remake it.

11. The appeals are allowed on the basis that  the  respondent's  decisions
    were not in accordance with the law and to the limited extent that  the
    appeals are remitted back to the respondent for the making of a  lawful
    decisions.

Decision

12. Appeals allowed.



Signed                              Date 30 June 2014.
