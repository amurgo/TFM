                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

      1. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal in a  decision
         dated 15 November 2017.

      2. The respondent indicates in her Rule 24 letter  dated  27  December
         2017 that she concedes the error of law (presumably following  Khan
         v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ  1755)
         and invites the Tribunal to remit  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal.

      3. As a result of those matters, the Upper Tribunal finds an error  of
         law, sets aside the decision and remits the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal to be heard at Hatton Cross.

      4. The hearing listed for 25 January 2018 is vacated.
