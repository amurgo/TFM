Anonymity

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is

applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on [ ] 1986.  On 1 April
    2016 he applied for asylum claiming to fear the Sri Lankan Government's
    authorities because of his stepfather's high level involvement with the
    LTTE.

 2. The application was refused by the respondent and the appellant
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal came before Judge
    Sweet.

 3. In a decision promulgated on 2 May 2017 the judge dismissed the appeal.
     The appellant is now appealing against that decision.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal did not find the appellant credible and
    rejected both his asylum and human rights claim.

 5. One of the issues before the First-tier Tribunal was that the
    appellant's stepfather had applied for asylum and been granted leave to
    remain.  At paragraph 46 of the decision the judge stated in respect of
    the stepfather's asylum application as follows:

         "His [step] father's claim succeeded only under Article 8 ECHR,
         because it was accepted by the parties that he had fallen for
         exclusion from protection under the Refugee Convention under
         Article 1F."

 6. The appellant's stepfather's asylum claim was heard by Judge Hussain on
    27 April 2011.  Judge Hussain, by a decision promulgated on 24 May
    2011, found that the appellant's stepfather was the subject of arrest
    and detention due to suspicion of involvement with the LTTE and that
    although he could not succeed in his asylum claim because of the
    exclusion under paragraph 1F of the Refugee Convention he was able to
    prevail under Article 3 ECHR.  The decision was made under Article 3
    ECHR, not Article 8 ECHR.

 7. Before me, Mr Jarvis accepted that that judge made an error of law by
    failing to appreciate that the appellant's step father's claim
    succeeded under Article 3 ECHR, not Article 8 ECHR. He also agreed that
    the error was material because it is relevant to the analysis of
    whether there would be risk on return. Given that the basis of the
    appellant's asylum claim is that he is at risk because of his step
    father, it is clearly relevant that the appeal before Judge Hussain was
    allowed under Article 3 ECHR.

 8. Both Mr Jarvis and Mr Muquit were of the view that the matter should be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal. Given that the appellant's
    credibility will need to be considered afresh and the likely extent of
    fact finding that will be required, I agree.

Notice of Decision

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
    law and is set aside.

10. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh by
    a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet.
