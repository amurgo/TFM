                            DECISION AND REASONS

This has been a remote hearing to which there has been no objection  by  the
parties. The form of remote hearing was skype for business. A face  to  face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable, and  all  issues  could
be determined in a remote hearing.

The appeals come before me following the grant of permission  to  appeal  to
the Upper Tribunal.

The appellants, mother and daughter, are nationals of Pakistan, born  on  15
April 1987 and 1 July 2015 respectively. They applied on 17  September  2018
for entry clearance to the UK under Appendix FM of the immigration rules  on
the basis of their  family  life  with  the  sponsor,  Zahoor  Hussain,  the
partner of the first appellant and the father of the second appellant.

The appellants' applications were refused on 3 December 2018  on  the  basis
that they could not meet the eligibility requirements of  Section  E-ECP  of
Appendix FM. The respondent noted  that  the  appellants  were  required  to
demonstrate that the sponsor had a gross income  of  at  least  �22,400  per
annum  but  considered  that  they  had  failed  to  provide  the  required,
specified evidence to demonstrate such an income. The respondent noted  that
the appellants claimed  that  their  sponsor  earned  an  annual  salary  of
�15,522 from his employment with 2 Sister Food Group and that  he  was  also
self-employed as a private hire driver and earned �8,227 in  the  last  full
financial year and �7,132  in  the  previous  financial  year,  before  tax.
However, the payslips provided did not  cover  the  entire  6  month  period
prior to the date of the application and the respondent  was  therefore  not
satisfied that the sponsor earned an annual salary of �15,522. Further,  the
bank statements provided did not cover the  entire  2016/17  financial  year
and it was not clear from the bank statements when the sponsor  received  an
income  from  self-employment.  The  respondent  could  not   therefore   be
satisfied that over the past two financial years the sponsor had  earned  an
average of �22,400 through employment and  self-employment.  The  respondent
considered further that there were no exceptional  circumstances  justifying
a grant of entry clearance on Article 8 grounds.

The appellants appealed that decision and the appeal came before  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Watson on 17 June 2019. The judge accepted that  the  sponsor
was employed by 2 Sister Food Group and that he was also self-employed as  a
taxi driver, but did not accept his oral claim to have been paid around  the
same for the past three years to be borne out by the  paperwork.  The  judge
did not accept that the requirements had been met under  Appendix  FM-SE  in
regard  to  the  relevant  documentary  evidence  and  considered  that  the
financial requirements of the immigration rules were therefore not met.  The
judge considered there to be  no  exceptional  circumstances  and  that  the
decision was therefore not disproportionate. There was no breach of  Article
8. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

The appellants sought permission  to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
Tribunal on the grounds that the documentary evidence provided  demonstrated
the required income and that the judge had erred by failing to consider  the
sponsor's income of �8227 from self-employment as net income/ profit  rather
than gross income. Furthermore,  the  judge  failed  to  consider  the  best
interests of the child.

Permission was refused in the First-tier Tribunal but  was  granted  by  the
Upper Tribunal on 5 December 2019 on a renewed application  on  the  grounds
that "it is arguable that there was sufficient evidence  to  show  that  the
appellants satisfied the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules".

The matter then came before me. Ms Mahmud  submitted  that  the  documentary
evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  showed   that   the   financial
requirements of the immigration rules were met.  Ms  Everett  accepted  that
the evidence showed that the sponsor had the required income  and  that  the
financial requirements were met at the relevant time  and  she  agreed  that
the decision in the appeal should accordingly be set aside  and  re-made  by
allowing the appeal, as requested by Ms Mahmud.

In light of  Ms  Everett's  helpful  concession,  I  need  not  provide  any
detailed reasons, other  than  to  accept  that  the  sponsor's  income  was
sufficient to meet the financial requirements of the  immigration  rules  at
the time of the respondent's  decision.  There  is  no  public  interest  in
refusing entry clearance to the appellants, given that  the  respondent  had
no other concerns,  and  accordingly  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  is
disproportionate and in breach of Article 8.  The  judge  erred  in  law  in
finding otherwise and  her  decision  must  be  set  aside  and  re-made  by
allowing the appellants' appeal.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error  on
a point of law. I set aside the decision and  re-make  it  by  allowing  the
appeals on Article 8 grounds.
