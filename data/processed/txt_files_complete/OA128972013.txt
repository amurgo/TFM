                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (the ECO) appeals  against  a  decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Thew promulgated on 8th October  2014.



 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female Turkish citizen born 1st May 1995 who  applied
    for entry clearance to enable her to settle in the United Kingdom  with
    her husband Erdem Mutlu (the Sponsor).

 4. The application, which was made in May 2013, was refused  on  6th  June
    2013, the ECO not accepting that the financial requirements of Appendix
    FM were satisfied.  It was not accepted that the Sponsor  had  provided
    the specified evidence required to prove that he had an  annual  income
    of at least ï¿½18,600.

 5. The Claimant's appeal was heard on 3rd September 2014.  Judge Thew (the
    judge) heard evidence from the Sponsor who was not cross-examined,  and
    considered additional evidence that had not  been  submitted  with  the
    application.  There was no prohibition on the  judge  considering  this
    further evidence if it was relevant to the application, as this is  not
    a points-based system application, where the Tribunal  can  in  general
    only consider evidence that was submitted with the application.

 6. The judge found that evidence had been submitted to prove the Sponsor's
    income from self-employment  and  the  appeal  was  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 7. The ECO was granted permission to appeal, and the appeal came before me
    on 9th January 2015.  I found that the judge had erred in allowing  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules because there was no evidence before
    the First-tier Tribunal that the  requirements  of  paragraph  7(g)  of
    Appendix FM-SE were satisfied, which requires evidence of ongoing self-
    employment through evidence of payment of Class  2  National  Insurance
    contributions.  I could find no satisfactory explanation for  the  non-
    production of this evidence.  I set aside the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, because the specified evidence required by Appendix  FM-
    SE was not provided, and therefore it was not  open  to  the  judge  to
    conclude that all specified evidence had been provided, and  the  judge
    had erred in allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 8. Another issue related to paragraph 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE,  as  it  was
    not clear whether personal bank statements for the  same  twelve  month
    period as the Sponsor's tax return showed that the  income  from  self-
    employment had been paid into the Sponsor's account.

 9. There had been no finding by the First-tier  Tribunal  in  relation  to
    Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, and this was
    an error, as section 86(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002, requires that any matter validly raised as a ground of appeal
    must be determined.

10. The hearing was adjourned so that I could  hear  further  evidence  and
    submissions in order to re-make the decision.

11.  Full  details  of  the  application  for  permission,  the  grant   of
    permission, and my reasons for finding an error of law are contained in
    my decision dated 19th January 2015,  which  was  promulgated  on  27th
    January 2015.

Re-Making the Decision - The Upper Tribunal Hearing 13th March 2015

Preliminary Issues

12.  The  Sponsor  attended  the  hearing.   There  was  no  need  for   an
    interpreter.

13. I ascertained that I had received  all  documentation  upon  which  the
    parties intended to rely, and that each party had served the other with
    any documentation upon which reliance was to be placed.  I had on  file
    the Respondent's  bundle  that  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    together  with  the  Notice  of  Appeal,  and  the  Claimant's   bundle
    comprising 52 pages.

14. I received from Ms Peterson a letter dated 25th February 2015 from  the
    Sponsor's accountants, ADD Accounting.

15. Both representatives confirmed that they understood that the purpose of
    the hearing was to consider outstanding points  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, those being the requirements  of  paragraphs  7(f)  and  (g)  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  Ms Peterson confirmed that she would not be making any
    oral submissions in relation to Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

Evidence

16. I heard evidence from the Sponsor who  adopted  his  witness  statement
    dated  3rd  September  2014.   He  was   not   questioned   by   either
    representative.

17. I then heard evidence from Mr Ismal Aghdiran who is the senior  partner
    of ADD Accounting.

18. Mr Aghdiran was questioned by both representatives.   I  have  recorded
    all questions and answers in my Record of Proceedings  and  it  is  not
    necessary to reiterate them here.

19. In very brief summary, Mr Aghdiran explained that in  relation  to  his
    self-employment, the Sponsor would take drawings from the business.  It
    was unrealistic to expect all of the income from  the  business  to  be
    paid into a bank account.  Drawings were taken in  cash  and  not  paid
    into the account, and this would be  accounted  for  by  a  petty  cash
    voucher  being  completed  by  the  Sponsor  and  passed  on   to   his
    accountants.

20. In relation to Class 2 National Insurance  contributions,  Mr  Aghdiran
    was asked whether the Sponsor was registered as  self-employed  in  May
    2013 when the Claimant applied for entry clearance,  and  he  confirmed
    that he was not registered.  This is referred to in the letter from ADD
    Accounting dated 25th February 2015 to which there is attached a letter
    dated 6th August 2012 to  HMRC  National  Insurance  Contributions  and
    Employer Office, registering the Sponsor as self-employed.

21. Mr Aghdiran confirmed that a telephone call had recently been  made  to
    HMRC, in which it had been confirmed that there was no  record  of  the
    letter dated 6th August 2012 and HMRC had not registered the Sponsor as
    self-employed notwithstanding that his tax return had been submitted in
    April 2013 recording self-employed income.  A further  application  had
    now been made to register the Sponsor as self-employed so that he would
    then receive a demand for Class 2 National Insurance contributions.  At
    the date of hearing the Sponsor had not received such a demand.

The Respondent's Submissions

22. Mr Avery submitted that it was clear  from  the  accountant's  evidence
    that paragraph 7(f) could not be satisfied because the income from  the
    Sponsor's self-employment had not been paid into the Sponsor's personal
    bank account.

23. In addition, the evidence from the Sponsor's accountant proved that  he
    was not registered as self-employed at the date of application which is
    why there was no evidence of ongoing self-employment  through  evidence
    of payment of Class 2 National Insurance contributions,  and  therefore
    the requirements of paragraph 7(g) of Appendix FM were  not  satisfied.
    The appeal therefore could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.

24. Mr Avery did not make any submissions on  Article  8,  because  of  the
    indication given by Ms Peterson that  she  would  not  be  making  oral
    submissions to suggest that the appeal should be allowed under  Article
    8.

The Claimant's Submissions

25. With reference to paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE, Ms Peterson asked that
    I note that the vast majority of specified documents had been supplied.
     It was conceded that the evidence indicated that not  all  the  income
    from self-employment was paid into the Sponsor's personal bank account,
    but Miss Peterson submitted that there was no requirement that all  the
    income must be paid into the account.  I was asked to  note  that  HMRC
    had confirmed the Sponsor's income.

26. In relation to paragraph  7(g)  and  the  Class  2  National  Insurance
    contributions,  Ms  Peterson  submitted  that  the  evidence  from  the
    Sponsor's accountant proved that attempts had been made in August  2012
    to register the Sponsor as self-employed, and the Sponsor had done  all
    that he could to be so registered.  I was  asked  to  accept  that  the
    Sponsor  is  in  ongoing  self-employment  and  was  at  the  date   of
    application, notwithstanding there is no evidence in the form of  Class
    2 National Insurance contributions.  I was asked to  allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

27. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.



My Conclusions and Reasons


28. The burden of proof in relation to the  Immigration  Rules  is  on  the
    Claimant, and the standard a balance of probability.  I have taken into
    account all the evidence that has been submitted by the parties.

29. I firstly consider paragraph  7(g)  of  Appendix  FM-SE.   Because  the
    Sponsor relies upon his  income  from  self-employment,  the  specified
    documentation set out in paragraph 7 must be provided.   I  accept  the
    Sponsor has provided evidence of the amount of tax payable, and that he
    has submitted his annual self assessment tax  return  to  HMRC,  and  a
    Statement of Account (SA300) and his Unique Tax Reference Number.

30. The Sponsor has however failed to provide  evidence  of  ongoing  self-
    employment through evidence of payment of Class  2  National  Insurance
    contributions.

31. There was no explanation for the non-production of this  evidence  with
    the application initially made to the Secretary of State,  which  meant
    that the initial decision maker could not decide  whether  to  exercise
    discretion under paragraph D(e) of FM-SE, which  provides  the  initial
    decision maker with a discretion not to apply  the  requirement  for  a
    document to be produced if there is a  valid  reason  why  a  specified
    document cannot be supplied.

32. The Sponsor in his witness statement dated 3rd September 2014 explained
    at paragraph 8(g) because he was  registered  as  an  employee  with  a
    limited company, he was  not  liable  for  further  National  Insurance
    contributions.  I find that that in fact is not the case, and I  accept
    the evidence of the Sponsor's accountant to the effect  that  HMRC  had
    never registered the Sponsor as self-employed and liable  for  Class  2
    contributions.

33. I accept that the accountants did send a letter to HMRC on  6th  August
    2012, but it is clear that the registration was not effective which  is
    why HMRC did not send  the  Sponsor  a  demand  for  Class  2  National
    Insurance contributions and explains why the Sponsor was  not  able  to
    provide evidence of payment of those contributions.

34. This is not the fault of the Sponsor, but that is not the  issue  I  am
    asked to decide.  I have to decide whether the specified  documentation
    required by paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE has been submitted, and I  am
    afraid that in relation to paragraph 7(g) that evidence  has  not  been
    submitted because it does not  exist.   Therefore  this  appeal  cannot
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.

35. In relation to paragraph 7(f) of Appendix  FM-SE,  I  accept  that  the
    Sponsor provided his personal  bank  statements  for  the  same  twelve
    months as covered by his tax return,  that  being  6th  April  2012-5th
    April 2013.  If  it  is  a  requirement  that  all  income  from  self-
    employment must go into those personal bank accounts, then  the  appeal
    would fail on that ground.  This is because it was accepted in evidence
    that some income from  self-employment  went  into  the  personal  bank
    account of the Sponsor but not all.  Neither representative was able to
    refer me to any authority on this issue as to whether all  income  must
    go into the Sponsor's  personal  bank  account,  or  whether  it  would
    suffice for some of the self-employed income to go  into  the  account.
    However, as the appeal cannot succeed in relation to paragraph 7(g)  it
    is not necessary to go on and reach a conclusion on this point.

36. Article 8 was not pursued before me, although it was raised as a ground
    of appeal.

37. In my view it is appropriate to make a finding on Article  8.   I  have
    considered the five stage approach set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I
    accept that the Claimant and  Sponsor  have  a  family  life  and  that
    refusal of  entry  clearance  interferes  with  that  family  life.   I
    therefore accept that Article 8  is  engaged,  but  conclude  that  the
    proposed interference is in accordance with the law.  This  is  because
    the Claimant  cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  which  must  be
    satisfied in order to be granted entry clearance as  the  spouse  of  a
    person settled in the United Kingdom.

38. I then have to consider whether the proposed interference  with  family
    life is necessary for one of the reasons set out in  Article  8(2)  and
    whether the interference is proportionate to the legitimate public  end
    sought to be achieved.

39. In considering proportionality I have regard to the factors set out  in
    section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   The
    maintenance  of  effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the   public
    interest.  I accept that  the  Claimant  can  speak  English  and  that
    notwithstanding that the  financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules cannot be satisfied, she would not be a burden on the taxpayer.

40. If this appeal were allowed under Article 8 (and I appreciate  that  Ms
    Peterson did not  suggest  this  course  of  action)  this  would  mean
    disregarding the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules  which
    in my view would not be appropriate.  The Supreme Court at paragraph 57
    of Patel and Others [2013] UKSC 72 stated;

         57.  It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing  power.   It  is  to  be  distinguished  from   the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human right.

41. It was accepted on behalf of the Claimant that  a  further  application
    for entry clearance could  be  made.   The  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance is in accordance with the law and is proportionate  and  does
    not breach Article 8.  This  is  because  significant  weight  must  be
    attached to the need to maintain effective immigration control, and the
    need of an applicant  for  entry  clearance  to  satisfy  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules.  There is no reason why a  further  application  for
    entry clearance could not be made, and the appropriate course of action
    is to make such an application, accompanied by the  required  specified
    evidence.

Notice of Decision


The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The Claimant's appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on  human
rights grounds.

Anonymity

There was no anonymity direction in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   There  has
been no request for anonymity and the  Upper  Tribunal  makes  no  anonymity
order.
