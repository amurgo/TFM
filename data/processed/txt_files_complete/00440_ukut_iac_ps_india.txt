For the Respondent:     Mr C. Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

In exercising discretion under paragraph 320(11) of HC 395, as  amended,  to
refuse an application for entry clearance in  a  case  where  the  automatic
prohibition on  the  grant  of  entry  clearance  in  paragraph  320(7B)  is
disapplied by paragraph 320(7C), the  decision  maker  must  exercise  great
care in assessing the aggravating circumstances said to justify refusal  and
must have regard to the public interest in encouraging those unlawfully in
the United Kingdom to leave and  seek  to  regularise  their  status  by  an
application for entry clearance.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Mr PS against the decision dated 22 July  2009  of
    the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  ("the  Tribunal")  refusing  the
    appeal of Mr S against the decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    dated 9 February 2009 refusing entry  clearance  both  under  paragraph
    320(11) of HC395 and under  paragraph  281  of  HC395  as  amended,  in
    particular paragraph 281(iv) and (v).


 2. The facts, briefly, are as follows.  It appears that Mr S  entered  the
    United Kingdom clandestinely in 2000  and  claimed  asylum,  which  was
    interpreted by the respondent  as  seeking  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom indefinitely.  His application was refused. He married SKR,  a
    British citizen.  Mr S had no leave to enter or remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom (but it appears that he sought to remain in the United  Kingdom
    indefinitely).  However, he returned to India in September 2008 with  a
    view to making an application from outside the United Kingdom  to  join
    his wife  in  the  United  Kingdom.   In  other  words,  he  sought  to
    regularise his immigration status in the United Kingdom.

 3. SR, Mr S's wife, lives with her cousin RK and  her  cousin  JSK  at  an
    address in Ipswich.  She now works as a manageress at a  shop,  earning
    about ï¿½840 per month.  She is provided by her cousin with free food and
    accommodation and the accommodation comprises an  apartment  above  the
    shop which has three double  bedrooms  and  one  single  bedroom.   She
    occupies one double bedroom on her own and her cousin and his wife  and
    children occupy the other two double  bedrooms.   The  single  room  is
    currently unoccupied.

 4. The Tribunal found that at the date of the decision SR  had  sufficient
    maintenance  available   and   that   there   was   also   satisfactory
    accommodation available for Mr S.  The Tribunal therefore found that Mr
    S satisfied the criteria under rule 281 (iv) and  (v).    However,  the
    Tribunal upheld the Entry Clearance Officer's  exercise  of  discretion
    under paragraph 320(11).


 5.  On  26  August  2009  Senior  Immigration   Judge   Chalkley   refused
    reconsideration, but on 21 January 2010 Collins J  in  The  High  Court
    ordered reconsideration on the basis that there  were  grounds,  indeed
    strong grounds, for concluding that the Tribunal had  made  a  material
    error of law.

The Relevant Rules

 6. HC395 at paragraph 320 lays down grounds on which  entry  clearance  or
    leave to enter is to be  refused.   As  from  1  April  2008  paragraph
    320(7B) was added to the immigration rules and provides, so far  as  is
    material to this appeal that entry clearance or leave to  enter  should
    be refused  where  the  applicant  has  previously  breached  the  UK's
    immigration laws by (a) overstaying, (b) breaching a condition attached
    to his leave, (c) being an illegal entrant, (d) using deception  in  an
    application for entry clearance, leave  to  enter  or  remain,  whether
    successful  or  not,  unless  the  applicant....  (iii)  left  the   UK
    voluntarily, not  at  the  expense  (directly  or  indirectly)  of  the
    Secretary of State more than 12 months ago.


 7. As from 30 June 2008 paragraph 320(7C) was added, disapplying paragraph
    320(7B), which was made subject to it, where the applicant was applying
    (as in this case) as (i) a spouse, civil partner or unmarried  or  same
    sex partner under paragraph 281 or 295(a).

 8. HC395 paragraph 320(11) provides that entry clearance or leave to enter
    should normally be refused:

        "where the applicant previously contrived in a significant  way  to
        frustrate the intention of the rules. Guidance  will  be  published
        giving examples of circumstances in  which  an  applicant  who  has
        previously overstayed, breached a condition attached to his  leave,
        been an Illegal Entrant or used Deception  in  an  application  for
        entry clearance, leave to enter or remain  (whether  successful  or
        not)  is  likely  to  be  considered  as  having  contrived  in   a
        significant way to frustrate the intentions of these Rules."

 9. These rules produce a somewhat complicated and  uncertain  system.   On
    the one  hand,  the  automatic  prohibitions  on  the  grant  of  entry
    clearance or leave to enter are disapplied in  certain  specific  cases
    and in relation to certain types of  application  as  explained  above.
    Nonetheless  paragraph  320(11)  then  offers  the  opportunity  for  a
    discretionary bar to be applied in  somewhat  uncertain  circumstances.
    The uncertainty is sought to be reduced by the promulgation of guidance
    under paragraph 320(11).  The guidance provides that a refusal of entry
    clearance or leave to enter under paragraph 320(11) may be given  on  a
    discretionary basis where an applicant has been an immigration offender
    or in breach of the UK immigration or other law  and  where  there  are
    aggravating circumstances.  The guidance then sets out a non-exhaustive
    list of aggravating circumstances which include absconding.

10. The guidance is to be found  in  Entry  Clearance  Guidance  under  the
    heading "Refusals"  and,  in  relation  to  aggravating  circumstances,
    provides as follows:

          "Please note that the  list  below  is  not  an  exhaustive  list.
           Aggravating circumstances can include actions such as:


          absconding;


          not complying  with  temporary  admission  /  temporary  reporting
          conditions / bail conditions;


          not complying with reporting restrictions;


          failing to comply with removal directions (RDs) after port refusal
           of leave to enter (RLE);


          failing to comply with RDs after illegal entry;


          previous working in breach on visitor conditions within short time
          of arrive in the UK (ie pre-meditated intention to work);


          previous recourse to NHS treatment when not entitled;


          previous receipt of benefits (income, housing,  child,  incapacity
          or otherwise) or NASS benefits when not entitled; using an assumed
          identity or multiple identities;


          previous use of a different identity or  multiple  identities  for
          deceptive reasons; vexatious attempts to prevent removal from  the
          UK, eg feigning illness; active attempt  to  frustrate  arrest  or
          detention by UK Border Agency or police;


          a sham marriage / marriage of convenience / polygamous marriage in
          the UK;   harbouring  an  immigration  offender;   facilitation  /
          people smuggling; escaping from UK Border Agency detention;


          switching of nationality;


          vexatious or frivolous applications;


          not complying with re-documentation process."

The guidance goes on to state:
          "All cases must be considered  on  their  merits,  the  activities
          considered in the round to see whether  they  meet  the  threshold
          under paragraph 320 (11), taking into account family life  in  the
          UK and, in the case of children, the level of  responsibility  for
          the breach.


          Where an applicant falls to be refused under 320(7A)  or  320(7B),
          the ECO must also consider  whether  it  is  also  appropriate  to
          refuse the  applicant  under  paragraph  320(11).   Where  320(7C)
          applies which makes an applicant exempt from 320(7B), an ECO  must
          consider  whether   a   refusal   under   paragraph   320(11)   is
          appropriate."

The Application of the Rules in the Present Case

11. The automatic prohibition of entry clearance  or  leave  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom was disapplied in the  case  of  Mr  S  under  paragraph
    320(7C) (see above).  Furthermore, paragraph 320(7B) did not  apply  in
    his case because he had left the United Kingdom voluntarily  more  than
    12 months before he made his application for entry clearance.  It might
    have been thought that the provisions of  paragraph  320(7B)  and  (7C)
    were, among other  things,  intended  to  encourage  a  person  in  the
    position of Mr S voluntarily to leave the  United  Kingdom,  to  remain
    outside the United Kingdom for a significant period and then to seek to
    regularise his immigration status by applying  properly  for  leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom to join his wife.  That would appear to  be  a
    desirable objective of the rules since it  would  encourage  those  who
    were unlawfully in the United Kingdom to leave and,  as  explained,  to
    seek to regularise their immigration status.


12. In applying paragraph 320 (11) to Mr S, however, the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer simply recited that Mr S had illegally  entered
    in 2000 and had sought to remain in the  United  Kingdom  indefinitely.
    The decision said that it was not clear how Mr S supported himself  but
    on balance it was probable that he  had  worked  illegally.   Then  the
    decision stated:


           "Given that you entered as a clandestine and  sought  to  remain
           indefinitely (which was refused) I am satisfied  that  you  have
           significantly  sought  to  frustrate  the  intentions   of   the
           immigration rules."


13. The Tribunal dealt with this matter at paragraph 21 of its decision:


           "I am satisfied that due to the extremely vague  nature  of  the
           explanation of how the  appellant  came  to  be  in  the  United
           Kingdom in the first place and why  he  was  able  willingly  to
           return to India, notwithstanding the fact that he  has  made  an
           asylum claim, has shown that he  has  sought  to  frustrate  the
           intentions of the immigration rules and notwithstanding the fact
           the  ground  on  which  the  Respondent  sought  to  refuse  the
           Appellant under  320(11)  is  a  discretionary  ground,  I  have
           concluded that the Respondent was right to refuse the  Appellant
           in all those circumstances."

Decision

14. The Entry Clearance Officer, in making the decision of refusal,  refers
    nowhere to the guidance  under  paragraph  320(11).   It  is  therefore
    wholly unclear whether the Entry Clearance Officer  has  addressed  his
    mind to the relevant question, namely whether in the  circumstances  of
    this case  Mr  S's  breach  of  UK  immigration  law  was  sufficiently
    aggravating so as to justify the refusal.  It  seems  to  us  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer should have specifically recognised that  Mr  S
    had voluntarily left the United Kingdom more than 12 months ago with  a
    view to regularising his immigration status.  There was no question but
    that the marriage was a genuine one.  If the aggravating  circumstances
    are not truly aggravating there is in this context a serious risk  that
    those in the position of Mr S will simply continue  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully and will not seek to regularise their  status
    as he has sought to do.  The effect  then  is  likely  to  be  counter-
    productive to the general purposes of the relevant  rules  and  to  the
    maintenance  of  a  coherent  system  of  immigration.    However,   as
    explained, the Entry Clearance Officer in this case did not address the
    correct question and did not carry out an adequate  balancing  exercise
    under the guidelines.  Furthermore, Mr S had made a claim under Article
    8 which, standing alone, may not have been  very  strong.   Nonetheless
    the family circumstances  needed  to  be  evaluated  carefully  in  the
    balancing exercise to which we have referred.

15. The decision of the immigration judge in effect endorsed  the  approach
    of the Entry Clearance Officer to the application of paragraph 320(11),
    an approach that  was  not  in  accordance  with  law.   Therefore  his
    decision was vitiated by the same  legal  error,  which  amounts  to  a
    material error of law.  Accordingly we set aside the  decision  of  the
    immigration judge.   He should have allowed the  appeal  on  the  basis
    that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was not in  accordance
    with law.  Therefore we remake the decision by allowing the  appeal  on
    this basis and remitting the matter to the primary decision-maker, with
    a direction that Mr S's application be considered  in  accordance  with
    this determination.
