Anonymity:

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court
    directs otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
    publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the  original
    Appellant. This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties.  Any
    failure to comply with this direction could give rise  to  contempt  of
    court proceedings. This direction has been made in order to protect the
    Appellant from serious harm, having regard to the interests of  justice
    and the principle of proportionality.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D O'Callaghan, Counsel, instructed by Barnes
Harrild & Dyer
     Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge James (the judge), promulgated on 17  October  2016,  in
    which she dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal.   That  appeal  had  been
    against the Respondent's decision of 26  May  2015,  refusing  a  human
    rights claim made on 24 April 2015.  The  application  had  been  based
    upon the Appellant's marriage to a British citizen husband.   An  issue
    of  the  Appellant's  claimed  bisexuality  had  been  raised  in   the
    application.   The  Respondent  refused  the  application,  noting  the
    Appellant's poor immigration history of prolonged overstaying  and  the
    absence of any insurmountable obstacles in the way of family life being
    enjoyed outside the United Kingdom (presumably in Nigeria).  There were
    said to be no exceptional circumstances in the case.

The judge's decision

 2. The judge sets out the basis of the Appellant's case at  paragraphs  11
    to 15.  At paragraph 17 she begins by stating, "The main issue  I  have
    to decide is whether the Appellant is bisexual or not".  Thereafter the
    judge makes a number of adverse credibility findings in respect of this
    issue and concludes that the Appellant was not in fact  bisexual.   The
    assertion that she was is said by the judge to have been a fabrication.



 3. At paragraphs 25 onwards  the  judge  considers  various  other  issues
    relating to Article 8.  At paragraph 25 she notes the acceptance by the
    Respondent that the  Appellant  and  her  husband  were  in  a  genuine
    subsisting relationship.  She also notes that the  husband's  financial
    circumstances were not challenged.  He  had  �37,000  in  his  business
    account in July 2016 and in excess of  over  �50,000  as  an  operating
    profit in respect of his IT business.  There was no issue in respect of
    the Appellant's ability to meet the English  language  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  At paragraph 28 the judge states:

         "... she does not meet the  time  criteria  under  the  Immigration
         Rules and is an overstayer, so is required to return  to  her  home
         country and make a proper application to regularise her  entry  and
         stay in the UK as a spouse."

 4. Paragraph 29 reads as follows:

         "The husband's work is in IT, which is a global  business  remotely
         accessible, and he also has an employee who can undertake work  for
         him on occasion if not part or full time.   The  husband  also  has
         dual nationality and a Nigerian passport, so he  is  able  to  take
         visits to Nigeria to see  his  wife.   He  confirmed  in  his  oral
         evidence he visited Nigeria  in  2015  and  2016,  thus  undertakes
         regular trips there, including to his extended family members (thus
         contradicting the facts made in his letters and  witness  statement
         and undermining his credibility).  Thus he can retain links to  her
         (sic) wife through visits, and also modern means  of  communication
         not least through his own IT consultancy business.   The  Appellant
         is able to apply for a visit visa, as well as a  spouse  visa  upon
         her return to Nigeria."

 5. Paragraphs 30 and 31 read:

         "30. I have no evidence that it would take a significant period  of
             time or that there would be any problems  with  the  Appellant
             making a timely application for a  visa  upon  her  return  to
             Nigeria.

         31.  It was accepted during submissions that the  Appellant  lacked
             entry clearance so did not meet the spousal  visa  rules.   It
             was accepted the Appellant had been illegally presented  (sic)
             in the UK since 2004 and that she had overstayed  in  2003  in
             breach of her visit visa conditions."

 6. In paragraphs 32 and 33 the judge finds that the Appellant  had  family
    members both in the United Kingdom and back in Nigeria.   At  paragraph
    34 the judge cites two cases relating to  the  principles  set  out  in
    Chikwamba (namely Hayat [2011] UKUT 00444  (IAC)  (although  of  course
    this case went up to the Court of Appeal and it is the court's judgment
    which should be considered: see [2012] EWCA Civ 1054)  and  R  (on  the
    application of Chen) [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC)).  In all the circumstances,
    the judge finds that the Respondent's decision  was  proportionate  and
    the appeal was duly dismissed.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The grounds of appeal submitted for  consideration  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal were settled by Counsel who had  appeared  before  the  judge.
    These grounds allege that there had been procedural unfairness  by  the
    judge in relation to the bisexuality issue and that the judge had erred
    in respect of a  consideration  of  other  Article  8  related  issues.
    Permission  was  refused  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Baker.   The
    Appellant herself then drafted grounds to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Soon
    after these were lodged, Counsel (who had appeared  before  the  judge)
    settled separate grounds of appeal.  These grounds essentially followed
    what had been asserted in those lodged with the First-tier Tribunal. It
    appears as though the second set of grounds were  not  put  before  the
    relevant Upper Tribunal Judge when the application  for  permission  to
    appeal was considered.  Upper Tribunal Judge  Pitt  refused  permission
    with regards to the Appellant's own grounds.  Following  correspondence
    from the Appellant's solicitors, Judge Pitt's decision was set aside by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Coker.  By a decision dated  1  June  2017,  Judge
    Coker granted permission with reference to the second set of grounds.

The hearing before me

 8. At the outset of the hearing Mr O'Callaghan confirmed that the  grounds
    of appeal drafted by previous Counsel included a Statement of Truth  at
    the end.  This effectively constituted a  witness  statement  asserting
    that the matters set out in the grounds were  factually  accurate.   Mr
    O'Callaghan acknowledged that a separate  witness  statement  may  have
    been an ideal  way  of  presenting  the  evidence  in  support  of  the
    procedural unfairness issue.

 9. I informed both representatives that as far as I could  see  the  Upper
    Tribunal had not asked the judge for her  comments  on  the  procedural
    unfairness issue.

10. The issue can be summarised as follows.  It is said on the  Appellant's
    behalf that the judge had confirmed at the outset of the  hearing  that
    she would not be considering  the  issue  of  the  claimed  bisexuality
    because the Appellant had failed to make a protection claim.  In  light
    of this, it is said, it was unfair of the judge then  to  consider  the
    issue in detail and make adverse credibility findings without  specific
    points being raised at the hearing in any way.  What  is  said  by  the
    Appellant (more specifically by previous Counsel) is certainly contrary
    to the clear statement made by the judge at the beginning of  paragraph
    17 (mentioned earlier in my decision).  Having regard to the Record  of
    Proceedings on file it appears to me as though the issue  of  sexuality
    was raised, albeit briefly,  in  cross-examination  of  the  Appellant.
    There is reference to this  issue  in  submissions  by  the  Presenting
    Officer as well, although there is nothing to say that this  aspect  of
    the claim was expressly disputed.

11. Initially, I was of the view that the comments of the judge  should  be
    obtained before I could fairly make a  decision  upon  this  ground  of
    appeal. However, on instructions, Mr O'Callaghan confirmed to  me  that
    he was withdrawing ground 1.  In light of this I reach no conclusion on
    the allegation of procedural unfairness.  Mr O'Callaghan relied  solely
    on ground 2.

12. There were two elements to the Appellant's submissions.  The  first  is
    that the judge  erred  in  her  consideration  of  whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant's husband going  to  live  in
    Nigeria permanently.  The husband had provided oral  evidence  that  an
    important part of  his  work  involved  being  on-site  in  the  United
    Kingdom; in other words, he was required to be at a particular location
    himself  when  undertaking  his  consultancy  work.    Mr   O'Callaghan
    submitted that the judge failed to deal with this evidence in paragraph
    29.  The husband's evidence had been unchallenged, and this  being  the
    case, going to live in Nigeria would have undermined the  viability  of
    the  husband's  business.   This  would  have  constituted  (at   least
    arguably) an insurmountable obstacle.  Mr  O'Callaghan  submitted  that
    maintaining a family life by way of  visits  to  and  from  the  United
    Kingdom was clearly an inadequate basis for dismissing a  human  rights
    appeal.

13. The second limb of Mr O'Callaghan's argument related to  the  Chikwamba
    principle.  He noted what the Supreme Court said about  this  issue  in
    Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11, at paragraph 51), a judgment  which  of  course
    postdates the judge's decision, but nonetheless represents a  statement
    of the law as it had  been  at  all  material  times.   Mr  O'Callaghan
    pointed out that the judge,  notwithstanding  her  adverse  credibility
    findings in relation to the bisexuality issue, had found that there was
    a genuine and subsisting relationship, that the husband's finances were
    well in excess of the minimum income threshold, that there was adequate
    accommodation, and that the Appellant could meet the  English  language
    requirements.  The only factor counting against the Appellant  was  her
    lack of status.  It was submitted that these accepted factors  had  not
    been considered  in  the  context  of  the  Chikwamba  principle.   The
    reference to relevant case law in paragraph 24 was brief  and  did  not
    come with any real engagement or reasons.

14. Mr Nath submitted that paragraph 29 represented an adequate  assessment
    of the insurmountable obstacles issue.  He suggested that the judge was
    concluding that the husband could continue with his work  if  he  lived
    full-time in Nigeria, or that he could live in the United  Kingdom  and
    visit his wife in Nigeria regularly, or that the  Appellant  should  go
    and make an entry clearance application.  Mr Nath sought to distinguish
    the Chikwamba case from  the  present  case  by  submitting  that  this
    Appellant had been an overstayer for a very significant period of time.



15. In reply Mr O'Callaghan submitted that taking holidays in  Nigeria  was
    not the same as working or attempting to  work  there  on  a  full-time
    basis.  He submitted that unlawful status in the United Kingdom did not
    rule out application of the Chikwamba principle.

16. Both representatives were agreed that if I were to find that there were
    material errors of law in the judge's decision  I  should  re-make  the
    decision on the evidence before me.  Having taken further  instructions
    Mr O'Callaghan confirmed that  in  any  re-make  decision  he  was  not
    relying upon the bisexuality issue.  He asked me to consider  the  rest
    of the evidence before me in the round.

17. Having taken a short break to  consider  matters  and  read  additional
    paperwork,  Mr  Nath  confirmed  to  me  that  the  reference  by   the
    Appellant's husband to being "on-site"  for  the  purposes  of  his  IT
    business did mean that he was required to be in the United Kingdom.  Mr
    Nath confirmed that he was not challenging the  husband's  evidence  in
    this respect.

18. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Decision on error of law

19. I conclude that there  are  material  errors  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.  My reasons for this conclusion are as follows.

20. First, having regard to the judge's Record of Proceedings and a note of
    hearing by previous Counsel (provided to  myself  and  Mr  Nath  by  Mr
    O'Callaghan) it is clear that the Appellant's husband did in fact state
    in oral evidence that he was required to be on-site as part of  his  IT
    consultancy business.  I am satisfied that this  particular  aspect  of
    his evidence was not challenged before the judge.  I am persuaded by Mr
    O'Callaghan's submissions that the judge has failed to engage with this
    important aspect of the evidence.  Whilst the point may have been  only
    somewhat briefly touched upon in evidence, it nonetheless represented a
    material consideration as to whether the husband's successful  business
    could continue to be viable if he were to go and live in Nigeria.   The
    requirement for him to be on-site in the United Kingdom would,  on  the
    face  of  it,  make  a  permanent  relocation  to   Nigeria   extremely
    problematic.  The fact that he  may  have  undertaken  some  visits  to
    Nigeria over the course of  time  is  not  the  same  as  living  there
    permanently, or indeed spending prolonged periods of time away.  In  my
    view the judge has failed to grapple with  this  point.   There  is  no
    clear reference to it in paragraph 29.  There is no  reasoning  on  the
    part of the judge to indicate that the employee could take the place of
    the husband in respect of on-site requirements.  I  am  satisfied  that
    there is a material error of law  in  this  respect.   It  is  material
    because  the  viability  of  the  husband's  business  was  capable  of
    supporting a conclusion that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    life in Nigeria, and because other substantive requirements of Appendix
    FM were found by the judge to be satisfied.

21. Second, it is by no means clear to  me  that  the  judge  was  in  fact
    concluding that family  life  could  be  adequately  maintained  simply
    through visits by the Appellant to her husband in the United Kingdom or
    vice versa.  If this was her conclusion, it is unsustainable.   Such  a
    state of affairs has never been relied upon by  the  Respondent  as  an
    appropriate method of maintaining a genuine and subsisting relationship
    between husband and wife.  Such a conclusion would not be supported  by
    either the contents of Article 8 related Rules or case law.

22. Third, there is then the entry clearance issue.  It is  of  course  the
    case that the Appellant was  an  overstayer  and  had  been  so  for  a
    considerable period of time.  This was always going  to  count  against
    her, and the judge was entitled to take this  into  account.   However,
    the absence of prior entry clearance as a spouse  and/or  the  unlawful
    status would not in and of itself mean that an  Article  8  claim  made
    within the United  Kingdom  would  be  bound  to  fail.   That  is  the
    underlying basis of the principle outlined in  Chikwamba,  as  followed
    and confirmed in Hayat in the Court of Appeal and most recently by  the
    Supreme Court in Agyarko.  What is said in the case  of  Chen  must  be
    read in light of binding authority from the Court  of  Appeal  and  the
    Supreme Court.

23.  Fourth,  notwithstanding  her  adverse  findings  in  respect  of  the
    bisexuality issue, the judge has made certain  favourable  findings  in
    relation to compliance with Appendix FM: namely the genuineness of  the
    relationship,  the  financial  circumstances,  accommodation,  and  the
    English language requirements.  The sole factor which the judge has  in
    effect relied upon to support her conclusion that the Appellant  should
    go and make an entry clearance application is the  lack  of  status  in
    this country.   With  due  respect  to  the  judge,  I  agree  with  Mr
    O'Callaghan's  submissions  that   the   findings   relating   to   the
    satisfaction of substantive requirements of the Article 8-related Rules
    (namely Appendix FM) was highly relevant to a consideration of  whether
    the Chikwamba principle applied in this case.  To my mind, I cannot see
    an  engagement  with  these  material  factors  in  the  context  of  a
    consideration of the Chikwamba issue.  Although case law  is  cited  in
    paragraph 34, there is no detailed reasoning attached thereto.  I  also
    note, as mentioned previously, that the Hayat case  cited  referred  to
    the Upper Tribunal's decision and not that judgment  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal. In all the circumstances I  consider  that  there  has  been  a
    failure to take relevant matters into account or an error  in  approach
    when considering  a  material  issue,  namely  that  of  the  Chikwamba
    principle.

24. For the above reasons I set aside the judge's decision.

Re-making the decision

25. In light of the representatives' views, as set out previously, I now re-
    make the decision on  the  basis  of  the  evidence  before  me.   This
    includes the  Respondent's  original  appeal  bundle,  the  Appellant's
    original bundle (indexed and paginated 1-195),  and  the  supplementary
    bundle (indexed and paginated 1-31).

26. As noted previously, the Appellant is not relying upon the  bisexuality
    issue.  For his part Mr Nath has accepted  the  husband's  evidence  in
    relation to his own business and has not sought to challenge any  other
    relevant aspect of the evidence before me.

27. I make the following findings of fact.  I  find  that  the  Appellant's
    marriage to her husband is and always has been genuine and  subsisting.
    They intend to live together permanently in the United Kingdom.  I find
    that the Appellant's husband runs an IT consultancy business, and  that
    this is successful.  I find that his income is way  in  excess  of  the
    minimum threshold  of  �18,600  a  year.   There  has  never  been  any
    suggestion that he is unable to satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM
    in this regard, and with reference to Appendix FM-SE I find  that  this
    is the case.  Even if he could not satisfy the particular  requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE, he nonetheless has an income  significantly  greater
    than that required by the Rules.  I find  that  the  Appellant  is  and
    would be adequately accommodated in the United Kingdom.   I  find  that
    she meets the English language requirements as set out in the Rules.

28. I find that the Appellant's husband is required to be  on-site  in  the
    United Kingdom in respect of significant elements of his IT consultancy
    business.  His evidence to this effect goes unchallenged,  and  in  any
    event it is a wholly plausible state of affairs.  I appreciate that  in
    a world of the internet and global  communications  some  work  can  be
    conducted remotely, as it were. However, the need for people to  be  in
    situ remains common-place.  I accept that if the husband were  required
    to go and live in Nigeria permanently, there is a very significant risk
    that his successful business would diminish or fail.  This  is  a  very
    significant factor in my view,  particularly  as  he  has  created  the
    business from scratch and is conducting it in the United Kingdom  as  a
    British national (in other words a person who has and  always  has  had
    every right to establish a business here).  I find that the husband has
    visited Nigeria in the past and would be able to visit in  the  future.
    However, I am satisfied that this could only involve  relatively  short
    holiday visits.  He would not be able to reside there long-term without
    damage to his business occurring, as stated previously.  I accept  that
    he has an employee, but also accept that this is not a partner  in  the
    business and is not a substitute for  the  husband's  presence  in  the
    United Kingdom when required.  I find that  the  Appellant  has  family
    both in the United Kingdom and in Nigeria.  I find that  the  Appellant
    and her husband have been seeking fertility  treatment  in  respect  of
    having a child.  This has been an ongoing  issue  in  their  lives,  as
    indicated in the reliable evidence before me.




Conclusions

29. I conclude that the Appellant succeeds in her human rights appeal.

30. Although I have found that she meets the  substantive  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, she cannot  qualify  under  the  five-year  partner  route
    because of her status in the United Kingdom.  E-LTRPT.3.2.(b)  applies:
    the Appellant has been in breach of immigration laws for  a  period  in
    excess of 28 days.  However, this provision does permit  the  Appellant
    to potentially succeed  under  the  ten-year  partner  route  if  EX.1.
    applies.  The relevant part of EX.1. reads as follows:-

         "the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK".

31. EX.2. reads as follows:-

         "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) 'insurmountable  obstacles'
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner".

32. I conclude that there are insurmountable obstacles in  this  case.   If
    family life is to be enjoyed to any meaningful extent  outside  of  the
    United Kingdom, the Appellant's husband would in effect have to move to
    Nigeria and reside there permanently.  On  this  scenario,  as  I  have
    found previously, it is more likely than not that his IT business  will
    suffer irreparable damage, and may  very  well  fail.   His  livelihood
    built up over time and in the secure setting  of  the  country  of  his
    nationality would be likely to fall away.  I conclude that there  would
    be no way of avoiding this danger if the husband were living in Nigeria
    full-time because that danger would arise from him  not  being  in  the
    United Kingdom, contrary to the requirement of being on-site.  Even  if
    this could be overcome  in  some  way,  there  would  be  very  serious
    hardship to the husband, namely,  the  loss  of  his  business  or  the
    significant  diminution  thereof,  and  the  resulting   economic   and
    emotional toll this would incur.

33. In light of  the  foregoing,  EX.1.  is  satisfied  and  the  Appellant
    succeeds in her appeal.

34. Alternatively, if the problems faced by the husband did not  constitute
    insurmountable obstacles, I nonetheless  conclude  that  the  Appellant
    succeeds.  The principle enunciated in Chikwamba  has  been  reaffirmed
    recently by the Supreme Court in Agyarko. At  paragraph  51  the  Court
    stated:



             "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is entitled
             to remain in the UK only temporarily, however, the
             significance of this consideration depends on what the outcome
             of immigration control might otherwise be. For example, if an
             applicant would otherwise be automatically deported as a
             foreign criminal, then the weight of the public interest in
             his or her removal will generally be very considerable. If, on
             the other hand, an applicant - even if residing in the UK
             unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted leave to
             enter, at least if an application were made from outside the
             UK, then there might be no public interest in his or her
             removal. The point is illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba
             v Secretary of State for the Home Department."

35. I direct myself that the principle may not constitute  a  hard-and-fast
    rule of law, and each case of course depends on its facts.

36. On the facts found in the present case, the Appellant meets all of  the
    substantive  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  in  relation  to   genuine
    relationship, financial support, accommodation,  and  English  language
    requirements.  These are crucial elements  of  the  overarching  public
    interest in maintaining effective immigration control.  The factor that
    has prevented her from satisfying the  five-year  partner  route  under
    Appendix FM is that relating to her lack of  status.   The  significant
    overstaying is relevant, but it is not in and of itself  fatal  to  the
    Appellant's argument on this issue.

37. Additional matters which I have taken account of  include  the  general
    uncertainties surrounding the timeframe for the making of, and decision
    upon, an entry clearance application from Nigeria,  together  with  the
    potential disruption of  fertility  treatment  in  the  United  Kingdom
    (which has been privately financed).

38. Notwithstanding the comments made in paragraph 41-42 of  Chen,  on  the
    facts as I have found them to be I cannot see what  could  be  sensibly
    achieved by requiring the Appellant to go back to Nigeria and  make  an
    entry clearance application.  In addition to such a  course  of  action
    having the potential to disrupt the fertility treatment, there is  also
    the fact  that  the  substantive  provisions  of  the  Rules  (as  they
    represent what the public  interest  requires  from  those  seeking  to
    remain in the United Kingdom) have been met.  The overstaying is not to
    be condoned, but nor is to be regarded as a means of punishing her,  as
    it were. All things considered and weighed  up,  the  balance  in  this
    particular case falls in favour of the Appellant.

Anonymity

39. I have  decided  to  make  a  direction  in  this  case.  Although  the
    Appellant's claim  to  be  bisexual  was  rejected  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, it remains a fact that she made that  assertion  and  it  has
    been cited and  considered  within  my  decision.  If  members  of  the
    Appellant's family or others connected thereto were to  have  knowledge
    of this aspect of her case, there  is  a  real  risk  of  consequential
    serious harm to her.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained material errors of law.

I set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

I re-make the decision by allowing the Appellant's appeal.

The Respondent's refusal of the Appellant's human rights claim breaches  her
Article 8 rights and is therefore unlawful under  Section  6  of  the  Human
Rights Act 1998.

An anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no fee  award.
The Appellant has won her appeal. However, she  put  forward  a  protection-
related element of her case which the judge  found  to  be  incredible,  the
grounds of appeal have been refined only at the last minute, and  the  other
matters have required adjudication.
