                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of
        First-tier Tribunal V A Cox promulgated on 14 August 2017 in  which
        the Judge allowed the appeal against the decision of the  Secretary
        of State to deport Mr Farah from the United Kingdom.



Background


     2. Mr Farah is a Dutch national born on 31 August 1998 who  claims  to
        have  entered  the  United  Kingdom  aged  two  and  who  has   two
        convictions for a total of four offences.
     3. On 6 November 2015 Mr Farah was convicted of (a)  using  a  vehicle
        whilst uninsured for which the sentence was  a  six-month  referral
        order, his parents were to attend meetings  of  a  youth  offending
        panel and his driving licence was endorsed, (b)  driving  otherwise
        than in accordance with the license for which the  sentence  was  a
        six-month referral order and  driving  licence  endorsed,  and  (c)
        driving a mechanically  propelled  vehicle  without  due  care  and
        attention for which the sentence was a  six-month  referral  order,
        �15 victim surcharge, �30 costs and driving licence  endorsed  with
        six points.
     4. On 22 November 2016 Mr Farah was convicted of Robbery and sentenced
        to a 2-year detention and training order.
     5. The Judge considered the documentary evidence  together  with  oral
        evidence from Mr  Farah,  his  mother,  father  and  three  of  his
        siblings, in addition to the documentary evidence provided  by  the
        Secretary of State. The Judge  found  Mr  Farah  to  be  an  honest
        witness and accepted that if deported his family would have to help
        him as he had no other support in Holland, a position supported  by
        Mr Farah's mother. The Judge found the appellant's father  was  not
        realistic in his evidence  and  sets  out  some  criticism  in  the
        decision  which  is  not  of  importance  at  this  stage  in   the
        proceedings.
     6. Having considered the evidence and submissions the Judge  sets  out
        findings of fact from [32] - [47] which can be  summarised  in  the
        following terms:


                  a. The Secretary of State has not dealt appropriately with
                     Regulation  27.  The   reasons   for   refusal   letter
                     identifies the appellant as being lawfully resident  in
                     the United Kingdom for 11 years and eight  months,  the
                     majority of which he was a minor and  is  dependent  on
                     his parents [33].
                  b. It is not necessary for  a  qualifying  EA  citizen  to
                     apply for a permanent residence card. The Secretary  of
                     State  has  accepted  all  other  family  members   are
                     entitled to a residence card and it  is  not  at  issue
                     that Mr Farah is the son of the mother and  father  who
                     appeared before the First-tier Tribunal [34].
                  c. Mr Farah was a  dependent  child  who  lived  with  his
                     parents from the time he came to  the  United  Kingdom.
                     At the time of the first offence Mr Farah  was  plainly
                     living in  the  UK  as  his  parents  were  subject  to
                     sanctions from  the  criminal  court  and  required  to
                     attend courses as the  parents  of  a  dependent  child
                     [35].
                  d. The Secretary State  makes  reference  in  the  refusal
                     letter to the  absence  of  evidence  of  comprehensive
                     sickness insurance for Mr Farah as a  dependent  child.
                     It was found at the time Mr Farah acquired his right of
                     permanent residence such evidence was not required with
                     dependent children as the respondent  plainly  accepted
                     that the regulations were met by the dependent children
                     of the mother and father and there was no  satisfactory
                     evidence of any difference between those children, some
                     of whom are older and some younger, than Mr Farah [36].
                  e. It was found Mr Farah does have a  right  of  permanent
                     residence under Regulation 15 [37].
                  f. The Tribunal was required to consider whether there are
                     imperative grounds of public security in respect of  Mr
                     Farah as he is someone who has resided  in  the  United
                     Kingdom for a continuous period of at  least  10  years
                     prior to the decision. It was conceded in  the  refusal
                     letter. Mr Farah would have automatically qualified for
                     permanent residence in March 2009 and has lived in  the
                     UK for a continuous period of at least 10 years  before
                     the date of the relevant decision [38].
                  g. The offence before the Tribunal may be serious  but  it
                     was  necessary  to  consider  Regulation  27(4)(a)  and
                     whether  there  are  "imperative  grounds   of   public
                     security" [39].
                  h. There are fundamental differences between the  position
                     of an alien  and  that  of  an  EEA  national  and  the
                     importance of the Citizenship Directive to protect  and
                     support Treaty rights of free movement of nationals  of
                     Member States and by extension nationals of  other  EEA
                     states [40].
                  i. Other than in the most serious cases, public  revulsion
                     and deterrence have little part to play save perhaps in
                     the  most  exceptional  cases.  Existence  of  previous
                     criminal convictions can only be taken into account  in
                     respect of whether circumstances constitute  a  present
                     threat to the requirement of public  policy.  If  found
                     there is a real risk of reoffending and that  Mr  Farah
                     is likely to act in the same way  in  the  future  past
                     conduct alone  could  constitute  a  threat  to  public
                     policy fundamental nature  of  the  principle  of  free
                     movement and the need to identify a present  threat  to
                     the requirement to public policy and whether there  are
                     imperative  grounds  for  public  security  which   are
                     overwhelming [41].
                  j. Although Mr Farah's offence is undoubtedly  serious  it
                     cannot be regarded as of  exceptional  gravity  of  the
                     kind of offence that an EA  citizen  comes  within  the
                     description of a serious ground  of  public  policy  or
                     public security sufficient to justify deportation [42].
                  k. Imperative grounds of public security is a considerably
                     stricter test than merely serious grounds but I do  not
                     find that  those  hurdles  can  be  surmounted  by  the
                     Secretary of State in respect of this matter [43].
                  l. Mr Farah has plainly behaved in a  wholly  unacceptable
                     way. He was a minor when he committed both the offences
                     and although they are escalating the suggestion that he
                     was led astray by older people was to be given  weight.
                     The Judge hopes that as an adult and  having  served  a
                     significant period of imprisonment Mr Farah understands
                     that such offending is wholly unacceptable [44].
                  m. Taking into account all the  circumstances,  the  Judge
                     could not find the offences can properly  be  described
                     as coming within the ambit of serious grounds of public
                     policy and public security in respect of Mr Farah [45].
                  n. The offending falls short of the imperative grounds  of
                     public security that are required in respect of an  EEA
                     national who has resided in the United  Kingdom  for  a
                     continuous period of at least 10  years  prior  to  the
                     relevant decision [46].
                  o. The Secretary of State's decision is not in  accordance
                     with the Regulations and that Mr Farah  can  claim  the
                     enhanced  protection  against  deportation  as  an  EEA
                     national [47].
                  p. It is not necessary to  consider  the  article  8  ECHR
                     issues [48].


     7. The Secretary of State sought the permission to appeal to the Upper
        Tribunal which was granted  by  another  judge  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal on 4 September 2017. The operative wording  of  the  grant
        being in the following terms:


             3.   This appeal hinges on a decision of the  respondent  made
                  on dated 31 March  2017  which  means  the  judge  had  to
                  consider the 2016 -17  EEA  Regulations  in  reaching  his
                  decision.


             4.   Even though I find the judge was correct  in  considering
                  the  2006  EEA  regulations  in  his  findings  that   the
                  appellant had acquired 10 years  of  permanent  residence,
                  having been resident in the United Kingdom since  the  age
                  of two years old, it is arguable that  his  decision  fell
                  into error because  he  appears  not  to  have  considered
                  regulation  27(8)  of  the  2016  EEA  Regulations,  which
                  requires a court or tribunal to have regard to schedule  1
                  (consideration of public policy, public security  and  the
                  fundamental interests of society,  etc)  when  considering
                  appeals  and  other  litigation  relating  to  EA  removal
                  decisions (which included deportation appeals). Permission
                  to appeal is granted.



Preliminary issue



     8. At the commencement of the hearing  it  was  necessary  to  discuss
        whether the grant of permission was a  limited  grant  or  not.  On
        behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Bates  argued  that  the  final
        sentence at the end of paragraph 4 that "permission  to  appeal  is
        granted"  indicated  that  permission  had  been  granted  to   the
        Secretary of State on all the grounds on which permission to appeal
        was sought. Mr Singer indicated that his reading of paragraph 4 was
        that the Secretary of State had been refused permission  to  appeal
        in relation to the challenge to the finding that the appellant  had
        acquired 10 years permanent residence and that permission had  only
        been granted in relation to the failure to consider  the  2016  EEA
        Regulations.
     9. The exact wording of paragraph 4 is set out above. In that,  First-
        tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro expressly states that  in  his  opinion
        the Judge was correct in finding  the  appellant  had  acquired  10
        years of permanent residence. This is not a  finding  that  it  was
        arguable that the Judge  had  made  any  form  of  legal  error  in
        relation to this aspect, resulting in an indication from the  Bench
        to the parties that the grant is a limited grant  by  reference  to
        the 2016 Regulations only.
    10. Mr Bates was therefore provided with two options which  was  either
        to accept the limited grant of permission in its terms or  for  the
        matter to be put off to enable the correct  notices  to  be  served
        upon the Secretary of State advising her that only a limited  grant
        of permission had been made and providing her with the  opportunity
        to  consider  whether  she  wished  to  renew  an  application  for
        permission to  appeal  in  relation  to  those  aspects  for  which
        permission was not granted to the Upper Tribunal.
    11. Mr Bates canvassed a further option by enquiring whether the  Upper
        Tribunal  would  enable  him  to  make  an  oral  application   for
        permission to appeal on those grounds  in  relation  to  which  the
        First-tier Tribunal had  refused  permission.  The  Upper  Tribunal
        accepted that it was possible for such an application  to  be  made
        subject to two aspects of procedural fairness which were,  firstly,
        that as I had already indicated in the earlier part of the decision
        that the grant was limited to the 2016 Regulations only,  the  fact
        this may indicate to some that this  was  the  view  of  the  Upper
        Tribunal, which Mr Bates accepted but also  accepted  he  would  be
        given a fair hearing of any oral  application  and,  secondly,  the
        issue of whether Mr Singer  would  be  in  any  way  prejudiced  as
        ordinarily he will be aware of the terms of any grant of permission
        to appeal before any hearing date  to  allow  him  to  prepare  his
        arguments in relation to the same. Mr Singer confirmed that he  had
        no concerns in relation to that matter and  indicated  he  will  be
        ready to proceed in any event.
    12. Mr Bates was therefore able to make oral submissions on  behalf  of
        the Secretary of State as to why permission  to  appeal  should  be
        granted in relation to a challenge to the finding of the Judge that
        the appellant  had  acquired  permanent  residence  in  the  United
        Kingdom and lived here for the requisite 10-year  period  entitling
        him to the highest level of protection.
    13. The original basis on which this was pleaded in the application for
        permission to appeal referred to the requirements to be  met  by  a
        student in the United Kingdom. Mr Bates did not pursue this matter,
        quite properly, and it appears that the grounds advanced by whoever
        prepared the original grounds of appeal on behalf the Secretary  of
        State may have issued a challenge on the wrong basis.
    14. The thrust of Mr Bates submissions was that the conclusion  by  the
        Judge that the appellant had obtained permanent residence  in  2009
        was not adequately reasoned and that the evidence before the  Judge
        on which this decision was made was not clear in relation to either
        the oral or documentary evidence regarding the  appellant's  father
        exercising treaty rights.  The  Judge  had  found  aspects  of  the
        appellant's father's evidence not to  be  reliable  and  there  was
        little evidence for the relevant period regarding the nature of the
        treaty rights the appellant's father was  said  to  be  exercising.
        There was, for example, in a letter from St Georges little evidence
        of the details of  employment  or  remuneration  received.  As  the
        status of the appellant's family members was relevant and  material
        to the status and findings relating to the appellant, it was argued
        the Judge failed to adequately reason or  to  show  that  permanent
        residence had been secured.
    15. It was also argued by Mr Bates that it was a requirement  according
        to case law for status of permanent residence to be determined as a
        prerequisite and that as the Judge's  conclusions  in  relation  to
        this aspect are flawed permission should be granted.
    16. Whilst the letter referred to by Mr Bates is  arguably  limited  Mr
        Singer noted that there had been a grant of permanent residence  to
        other  family  members  based  upon  the  evidence  of  the  family
        circumstances and that the Judge had  found  the  evidence  of  the
        appellant and other family members to be credible.  It  was  argued
        the Secretary of State's advocate at the First-tier hearing did not
        dispute the appellant's father's position and  had  not  raise  the
        points made by Mr Bates in challenge today.  The  Judge  had  found
        that the necessary five years had been satisfied such that a  right
        of permanent residence had been accrued.
    17. It was noted the appellant had been in the United Kingdom since  he
        was two and lived with his parents who have been granted status  in
        the United Kingdom.
    18. Mr Bates in response stated there had been no  concession  at  [22]
        and that the conclusion in relation to status was left to the Judge
        and,  on  the  evidence,  he  questioned  whether  the  Judge   had
        adequately reasoned those findings.
    19. The application for permission to challenge the finding in relation
        to the appellant having permanent residence and an  entitlement  to
        the highest level of protection was refused. Mr Bates had failed to
        establish realistic prospects of success or arguable  legal  error,
        the matters  on  which  he  made  his  application  are  not  those
        originally before the First-tier Tribunal when  seeking  permission
        to appeal although Mr Bates argued that an application to amend was
        not required as the core aspect, findings in  relation  to  status,
        were pleaded.
    20. In light of the failure  to  establish  any  arguable  legal  error
        material to the decision to dismiss the appeal and the  refusal  of
        permission, the case proceeded on the basis of the limited grant of
        permission set out above.



Error of law


    21. In relation to the 2016 Regulations, Mr  Bates  submitted  that  in
        light of the fact the appellant having acquired permanent residence
        had been made out, and that the relevant ground was the  imperative
        ground of protection, it was necessary to consider Schedule  1  and
        Regulation 27 of the 2016 EEA regulations.
    22. It was submitted the Judge erred in law in not considering whether,
        even though the applicant had acquired the imperative ground, there
        had been a break in his period of integration in the United Kingdom
        such that the level of protection was not at the highest level.  It
        was submitted that at [44] in which the Judge finds:


             44.   The  Appellant  has  plainly   behaved   in   a   wholly
                  unacceptable way. He was a minor when he committed both of
                  the offences and although they are escalating and  I  find
                  his suggestion, sadly supported by his family, that he was
                  led astray by older people to be of little weight.  It  is
                  to be hoped that now as  an  adult  and  having  served  a
                  significant period of  imprisonment  he  would  understand
                  that such offending is wholly unacceptable and that he has
                  let both himself and his family down.


         is speculation for if the Mr Farah had not learned  his  lesson  it
         could not be said he was integrated and that a real risk arises.
    23. Mr Bates submitted that case law relating to  'imperative  grounds'
        shows the threshold is not fixed in time and  that  when  assessing
        integration, the Judge failed  to  consider  all  relevant  factors
        before concluding the requisite 10 years have been satisfied  bring
        into play the 10-year policy.
    24. It was submitted that the  offending  was  serious  and  the  Judge
        needed to have regard to the use of  rehabilitation  and  issue  of
        further ongoing offending in addition to placing reliance upon  the
        pleaded grounds.
    25. Mr Singer sought to rely upon his Rule  24  response  in  which  he
        asserted there was no material error made by the Judge and that  in
        reality the challenge by the Secretary  State  amounted  to  little
        more than a reasons challenge. It  is  argued  the  conclusion  the
        appellant had accrued permanent residence and lived in  the  United
        Kingdom for more than 10 years is a sustainable finding and that no
        arguable legal error had been made out.
    26. It is noted the issue of Schedule 1 to  the  2016  regulations  was
        raised in the skeleton argument before the Judge who also  accepted
        the credibility of the evidence which the Judge was provided.
    27. This is also a  case  of  an  individual  EEA  national  committing
        offences in the United Kingdom prior to attaining  adulthood  which
        is  a  relevant  issue  when  considering  the  law   relating   to
        deportation.
    28. The Upper Tribunal accepts the submission that the Judge  may  have
        set out the findings made in a more  structured  manner  reflecting
        the provisions of the Schedule relied  upon  by  the  Secretary  of
        State which may assist have assisted a reader and, as noted at  the
        hearing, if this had happened it may be  this  matter  would  never
        have got as far as it did.
    29. The  evidence  does  not  support  a  conclusion  that  Mr  Farah's
        integration into the United Kingdom, which he clearly had  acquired
        having entered at the age of  two  and  now  being  an  adult,  was
        disrupted to any material  degree  as  a  result  of  his  criminal
        conduct. Commission of  crimes  does  not  automatically  have  the
        effect of  taking  away  from  an  individual  previously  acquired
        integration although is a relevant  factor.  The  Judge  was  fully
        aware of the fact Mr Farah had spent his  formative  years  in  the
        United Kingdom but does not find that the ties he has  formed  have
        been lost. This is the basis of the finding of entitlement  to  the
        higher degree of protection.
    30. The Judge notes that as the higher degree of  protection  has  been
        acquired and is enjoyed by  Mr  Farah  it  was  necessary  for  the
        Secretary of State to establish imperative grounds of public policy
        or public security. The conclusion the higher level  of  imperative
        grounds is engaged has not been shown to be a  finding  not  within
        the range of those available to the  Judge  on  the  basis  of  the
        evidence provided to the First-tier Tribunal.
    31. It matters not whether another judge of that tribunal or indeed the
        Upper Tribunal would make the same decision, or not, as that is not
        the relevant test. On the basis of the information  made  available
        it has not been made out  that  the  conclusions  are  in  any  way
        arguably perverse or  irrational  or  fall  outside  the  range  of
        findings the Judge was entitled to make when considering the  facts
        and applicable law relating to this appeal.
    32. At the conclusion of the hearing, when the  decision  was  formerly
        reserved, Mr Farah was advised that if this  finding  goes  in  his
        favour he must ensure that he commits no further  offences  in  the
        future. Mr Farah is now an adult  and,  like  most  EEA  nationals,
        faces uncertainty into relation to what may  occur  if  the  United
        Kingdom leaves the European Union as a result of the  Brexit  vote.
        It has long been understood that a person who is an EU citizen  who
        has acquired rights in the United  Kingdom  is  more  difficult  to
        remove as a result of acts of criminality than a person who is  not
        an EEA national who is  removed  pursuant  to  the  U.K.s  domestic
        legislation relating to the deportation of foreign criminals. If Mr
        Farah wishes to remain in the United Kingdom, and not disappoint or
        let down his parents any further, he will ensure that he  will  not
        come to the attention of the criminal courts or  the  Secretary  of
        State on any future occasion.
    33. As no arguable legal error material to the decision  to  allow  the
        appeal has been  made  out  the  Secretary  States  application  is
        dismissed.

Decision

    34. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    35. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
