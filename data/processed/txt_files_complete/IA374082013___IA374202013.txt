Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A Eaton of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. The appellants, who are mother and daughter,  are  nationals  of  Jamaica
   born on 21 July 2079 and 18 September 2006  respectively.  They  appealed
   against the decisions of the respondent dated 27 August  2013  to  refuse
   them leave to remain in United Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules  and
   pursuant to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  First-
   tier Tribunal Judge M.A. Khan dismissed their appeals in a  determination
   dated 24 February 2014.


2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley  on
   17 March 2014 in respect of ground 1. Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan granted
   the appellant's permission to appeal saying "I am not prepared to  refuse
   the appellant the opportunity to  argue  Joy's  rights  on  a  permission
   application when the Judge did not deal with them. Hence  I  shall  grant
   leave on all the grounds advanced".


3. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Jordan  stated  that  it  was  for  the  Judge  to
   determine on the evidence whether Joy was a British citizen pursuant to s
   1 of the British Nationality Act 1981 to the effect that if a  person  is
   born in the United Kingdom they shall be a British citizen if at the time
   of the birth of their father was settled in the United Kingdom. There  is
   no discretion vested in the Secretary of State.


   The First-Tier Tribunal Judges Findings


4. The Immigration Judge, in dismissing the appeals under Article  8,  found
   that as  Joy  was  a  Jamaican  national  at  the  date  of  the  hearing
   notwithstanding her application for British citizenship.  The  appellants
   made an application for settlement outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
   Judge found at paragraph 34 "it is said that the second appellant,  Joy's
   case is covered by appendix FM as she was born in this  country  and  has
   lived here for the past seven years. Joy had not lived in the UK  for  at
   least seven years immediately preceding the date of her application.  Joy
   was born on 18 September 2006 and the application was made on  August  29
   August 2012  which  makes  her  six  years  old  from  the  date  of  her
   application. Both appellants are therefore not covered by Appendix FM  of
   the Immigration Rules.


5. The Judge noted that it  is  argued  that  Joy  is  entitled  to  British
   citizenship and an application has been made on  her  behalf.  The  Judge
   stated that whether this application will succeed is another  matter  but
   at the present moment, Joy is a Jamaican national along with her  mother.
   The case therefore is not covered by the new Immigration Rules and has to
   be considered pursuant to Article 8.


6. The first appellant's private life can continue in  Jamaica  even  though
   she has been in this country since 2001. She has family  in  Jamaica  and
   has at least on one occasion visited them. As far as Joy is concerned she
   was born in the United Kingdom. Mr Okoye is named as the  father  on  her
   birth certificate. There are serious inconsistencies as to how  long  the
   first appellant and Mr Okoye were in a relationship. Mr Okoye  said  that
   they were separated soon after Joy's birth and that Joy  has  lived  with
   her mother ever since birth. There are also contradictions as to how much
   contact Joy has had with her father. The evidence of both  Mr  Okoye  and
   the first appellant's evidence has been exaggerated as to  the  level  of
   contact Joy has with her father. On the evidence Mr Okoye does not  "play
   a great deal of role in Joy's life".


7. In respect of Joy's best interests as a  child  born  and  lived  in  the
   United Kingdom for seven years these have to be considered under  section
   55 of the Borders 2009 Act and in the guidance in the case of ZH Tanzania
   and EB Kosovo. In making his assessment, he  has  considered  that  Joy's
   best interests must be of primary consideration, although  not  the  only
   consideration.  Her  interests  do  not  have  the  status  of  paramount
   consideration.


   Appellant's Grounds of Appeal

8. The appellants' grounds of appeal state  the  following.  The  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge failed to consider SC (Article 8-in  accordance  with  the
   law) Zimbabwe [2012] UKUT 56 (IAC). The appellant's daughter was born  18
   September 2006 and has been resident in the UK  for  in  excess  of  7  �
   years. Joy has subsequently been granted British citizenship.


       Submissions of the Parties at the Hearing

9. Mr Eaton in his submissions stated the following. The judge did not  take
   into account that the appellant has been in this country for 7 � years or
   that she had made an application for British  citizenship.  Joy's  father
   was naturalised as a British citizen  before  her  birth.  Therefore  the
   Judge did not consider ZH Tanzania in respect that Joy was a  British  or
   was entitled to British citizenship  by  law.  The  Judge  erred  in  not
   considering Joy's rights as a British citizen to live  in  this  country.
   Her mother has been in this country for 12 years lawfully which  was  not
   considered by the First-tier Judge.


10. Mr Bramble on behalf of  the  respondent  submitted  the  following.  No
   attempt was made to address the presumption at paragraph 41 and 43  which
   clearly deals with the seven year rule within the Immigration Rules.  The
   issue of the appellant's application for British citizenship was dealt by
   the  Judge  as  far  as  he  was  able.  Joy's  biological  father's  was
   naturalised after Joy's birth and therefore there was  a  grey  area.  In
   respect of the private life of the first appellant the Judge  dealt  with
   the issue  and  relied  on  the  evidence  before  her  to  come  to  his
   sustainable  conclusion.  The  Judge's   decision   is   fully   reasoned
   notwithstanding that Joy is now a British citizen.


   Findings on Error of Law


11. The appellants' main argument is  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Khan failed to take into account that Joy had  made  an  application  for
   British citizenship and should have been considered her  British  citizen
   and the guidance in ZH Tanzania should have been applied in  the  Judge's
   evaluation of her rights pursuant to the Immigration Rules and Article 8.


12. Upper Tribunal Judge when giving permission to appeal  stated  that  the
   Judge should have made a finding on the evidence before him  whether  Joy
   is a British citizen pursuant to s 1 of the British Nationality Act 1981.
   This is because as long as Joy's father was settled in the United Kingdom
   as at the date of Joy's birth, she is entitled to British citizenship and
   the respondent has no discretion in the matter. Mr Bramble on  behalf  of
   the respondent stated that in Joy's case, there was a grey  area  because
   her father was not naturalised until after her birth. Subsequent  to  the
   Judge's determination, Joy's application for British citizenship has been
   successful and therefore she is now a British citizen.


13. The Judge acknowledged that Joy had  made  an  application  for  British
   citizenship but stated that as at the date of the hearing the application
   had not been decided by the respondent. Given that  the  evidence  before
   the Judge was that Joy's father was a British citizen at the date of  the
   hearing, he should have taken into account the possibility that Joy is  a
   British citizen and should have made alternative findings  on  the  bases
   she is one. By his failure to consider Joy's rights as a possible British
   citizen has led him into material error.  I  agree  with  Upper  Tribunal
   Judge Jordan that Joy should be given an opportunity to argue her case on
   the bases that she is a British citizen.

14. In the case of ZH Tanzania [2010] UKSC 4, the Supreme  Court  emphasised
   that, in order to comply with international obligations, including the UN
   Convention on the rights of the Child 1989 as well as domestic law in the
   form of section 55 of the Borders Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009,
   when assessing human rights  applications  which  involve  a  child.  The
   appellant must treat the  best  interests  of  the  child  as  a  primary
   consideration.


15. The Upper Tribunal in LD Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT (IAC) stated at  paragraph
   26 that very weighty reasons are needed to  justify  separating  a  child
   from the community in which he or she had grown up and lived for most  of
   her life. At paragraph 27, the Upper Tribunal stated  that  although  the
   seven-year policy has been withdrawn but it had  been  an  administrative
   way of giving effect to the principle of the welfare of the  child  as  a
   primary consideration and in such cases,  when  it  was  considered  that
   those interests  normally  required  regularisation  of  the  immigration
   position of the family as a whole.


16. In the Upper Tribunal case of EM Zimbabwe [2011] UKUT 98  (IAC)  it  was
   stated that in the absence of any other policy guidance by the  Secretary
   of State, it remains legitimate  for  immigration  Judges  to  give  some
   regard to the previous policy that seven years residence by a child under
   18 could afford a basis for regularise the  purposes  of  the  child  and
   parent in the absence of reasons to the contrary, in  making  a  judicial
   assessment of whether removal is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
   having regard to the best interests of the child.


17. In NF Ghana [2008] EWCA Civ 908, the Court of Appeal  gave  guidance  in
   respect of the former seven years policy. They stated that if a child has
   lived in this country for seven years they should start from the position
   that it is only in exceptional cases that indefinite leave to remain  not
   be given.


18. In light of the case law referred to above, it is only  right  and  fair
   that the both appellants appeal be considered on the bases that Joy is  a
   British citizen. Mr Eaton stated at the hearing that if I find  an  error
   of law the appeal be adjourned.


   The renewed hearing on 16 October 2014


19. At the hearing, I heard submissions from both parties the full notes  of
   which are in my Record of Proceedings.

Findings

20. I shall first consider  the  appellants  appeal  under  the  Immigration
   Rules. There is no dispute that the first appellant is the mother of  the
   second appellant and the first appellant has been in this  country  since
   2001. There is also no dispute that the majority of that time  the  first
   appellant has spent in  the  United  Kingdom  with  continuous  leave  to
   remain. The second appellant was born in the United Kingdom and  is  over
   seven years of age.


21. At the time of the application the  first  appellant  was  aged  34  and
   therefore not under the age of 18. Neither was she aged 18 years or above
   and under 25 years of age. She therefore cannot meet the requirements  of
   paragraph 276 ADE (iv) and 276 ADE (v). Her appeal therefore can only  be
   considered pursuant to Article 8  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  are
   Article 8 compliant.  It  will  therefore  only  be  in  exceptional  and
   compelling circumstances that the first  appellant  would  succeed  under
   Article 8 when she cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules.


22. Rule E-LTR PT. 2.2 sets out the requirements for a child  who  is  under
   the age of 18 at the date of application and  is  living  in  the  United
   Kingdom and is a British citizen. Paragraph 276 ADE  of  the  Immigration
   Rules states that the requirements are that the applicant "is  under  the
   age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the UK for at  least  seven
   years.... And it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave
   the UK.


23. I  find  that  the  second  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the
   Immigration Rules and the respondent did not seek to argue otherwise.


24. In determining whether the first  appellants  removal  from  the  United
   Kingdom would constitute a disproportionate interference with  his  right
   to respect  for  private  and  family  life  under  Article  8,  we  have
   considered each of the following issues, as laid down at paragraph 17  of
   the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in R v. Secretary of State for the
   Home Department, ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27:

       (1)  Will the proposed  removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
           authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to  respect
           for his private or family life?


       (2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity
           as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?


        3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


        4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society in
           the  interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
           economic well-being  of  the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
           disorder or crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or
           for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?


        5) If so, is such  interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
           public end sought to be achieved?

25. The question that I have to decide is whether the refusal  of  leave  to
   the appellant, 'in circumstances where the  life  of  the  family  cannot
   reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking  full  account  of
   all considerations weighing in favour  of  the  refusal,  prejudices  the
   family life of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious  to  amount
   to a breach of the fundamental right protected by  article  8'  (Huang  v
   Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2007]  UKHL  11  ('Huang'),
   para. 20).  In considering this question, we have taken into account  all
   factors that weigh in favour of the  Appellant's  deportation,  including
   the desirability of applying a workable, predictable, consistent and fair
   system of immigration control (Huang, para. 16).  Against this,  we  have
   taken into account the effect that refusal of leave  would  have  on  the
   enjoyment of the appellant's private and family life in  the  appellant's
   case, bearing in mind the core value that Article 8 of the  Human  Rights
   Convention seeks to  protect  and  the  fact  that  '[t]heir  family,  or
   extended family, is the group on which many people most  heavily  depend,
   socially, emotionally and often financially' (Huang, para. 18).


26. I have further considered the case  recent  decision  of  the  House  of
   Lords in Beoku-Betts (FC) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
   Department [2008] UKHL 39 where the issue for determination  was  phrased
   in the following terms:

        'In determining an appeal under section 65 of the  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) (now  sections  82  and  84  of  the
        Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (the  2002  Act))
        against the Secretary of State's refusal of leave to remain on  the
        ground   that   to   remove   the   Appellant    would    interfere
        disproportionately with his article 8  right  to  respect  for  his
        family life, should  the  immigration  appellate  authorities  take
        account of the impact  of  his  proposed  removal  upon  all  those
        sharing family life with him or only its impact upon him personally
        (taking  account  of  the  impact  on  other  family  members  only
        indirectly ie. only insofar as this would in turn  have  an  effect
        upon him)?

27. Baroness Hale observed that 'the right to respect for  the  family  life
   of one necessarily encompasses the right to respect for the  family  life
   of others, normally a spouse or minor children,  with  whom  that  family
   life is enjoyed'.  It was further  said  that:  'Together  these  members
   enjoy a single family life and whether or not the removal would interfere
   disproportionately with it has to be looked at by reference to the family
   unit as a whole and the impact of removal upon each  member.  If  overall
   the removal would be disproportionate, all affected family members are to
   be regarded as victims'.  In light of this decision we have  to  consider
   the family life of all  those  who  share  their  family  life  with  the
   Appellant.


28. I have had regard that from 28 July 2014 section 19 of  the  Immigration
   Act 2014 is brought into force: article 3 of  the  Immigration  Act  2014
   (Commencement No 1, Transitory and  Saving  Provisions)  Order  2014  (SI
   2014/1820). This amends the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
   by introducing a new Part 5A which contains sections 117A, 117B, 117D and
   117D. Part 5A only applies where the Tribunal considers Article 8(2) ECHR
   directly.



29. I answer the first four questions in  Razgar  in  the  affirmative.  The
   only issue in the appeal in respect of the first appellant therefore  for
   me to decide is proportionality. I guide myself that I must make  a  fact
   sensitive assessment of the appellants' circumstances  and  make  my  own
   assessment of proportionality. When considering whether a decision is  in
   accordance with the law, it has been authoritatively established  by  the
   higher  courts  that  the  test  to  be  applied   is   not   exceptional
   circumstances or insurmountable obstacles. It is obvious that respect for
   a claimant's family and private life under Article 8 (1)  is  subject  to
   proportionate and justified interferences in pursuit of a legitimate  aim
   under Article 8(2). (Izuazu)



30. The appellant is a British citizen and in  ZH  Tanzania  it  was  stated
   "Nor should the intrinsic importance of citizenship be  played  down.  As
   citizens these children have rights  which  they  will  not  be  able  to
   exercise if they have to leave the country. They will lose the  advantage
   of growing up and being educated in their own country, their own  culture
   and their own language".


31. I take into account the case of SC (article  8-in  accordance  with  the
   law) Zimbabwe UKUT [2012] 56 IAC which states  that  in  the  absence  of
   contraveling factors, residents of over seven years with children who are
   integrated into the educational system in the United Kingdom, is a strong
   indicator that the welfare of the child  favours  regularisation  of  the
   status of the parents and children.


32. I also consider the appeal with reference to s55  of  the  2009  Borders
   Act where the best interests of the child must be considered as a primary
   consideration.


33. I have taken into account the public interest  in  maintenance  of  firm
   and fair immigration control.


34. The second appellant was born on 18 September  2006  and  therefore  has
   been resident in the United Kingdom in excess of 7 �  years.  Her  father
   lives in the United Kingdom as does  her  half-sister.  Her  mother,  the
   first appellant has lived in this country since 2001.  I  find  that  the
   first appellant has developed substantial  private  life  in  the  United
   Kingdom.  I find that in the circumstances, it would not be proportionate
   to require the first appellant to leave the country and return to Jamaica
   when she is the main carer of a British citizen child.


35. Considering all the evidence in  the  round  that  the  first  appellant
   succeeds pursuant to Article 8 as the main carer of the  British  citizen
   child.






   Decision


   Appeal allowed for the first appellant  pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the
   European Convention on Human Rights.


   Appeal allowed for the  second  appellant  pursuant  to  the  Immigration
   Rules.
