                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

Introduction

      1. The appellant ('the SSHD') has appealed against a decision of First-
         tier Tribunal ('FTT') Judge Isaacs, promulgated on 8 November 2019,
         allowing Mr Charania's appeal against a decision dated  10  January
         2019 refusing his human rights claim.

Background

      2. Mr Charania is a citizen of India who arrived in the United Kingdom
         ('UK') as a student in 2007.  He  has  been  continuously  lawfully
         resident in the UK since that time.  His application for indefinite
         leave to remain ('ILR') based upon his long residence  pursuant  to
         276B of the Immigration Rules, dated 1 June 2006, was  refused  for
         one reason only.  In short, the SSHD considered  that  Mr  Charania
         had been dishonest in an earlier application for leave to remain in
         March 2013  (when  he  relied  upon  an  income  of  some  �50,800,
         including �18058.49 PAYE employment and �32,773.65  self-employment
         and  /  or  when  he  submitted  his  HMRC  tax  return   for   the
         corresponding tax year ending 2013 (when he  declared  �0  income),
         and refused his application under the 'general grounds for refusal'
         at paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

      3. This is therefore an 'earnings discrepancy' case.  In this case the
         SSHD acknowledged that Mr Charania revised his tax calculation  for
         2013  on  17  November  2016  but  considered  that  the  delay  in
         correcting his HMRC declaration demonstrated  little  intention  of
         correcting the errors promptly and little respect for the UK's  tax
         laws.

      4. The FTT considered documentary and oral evidence and accepted  that
         Mr Charania was generally credible.  The FTT concluded that he  had
         not engaged in dishonest conduct and allowed his appeal on  Article
         8 grounds, on the  basis  that  he  met  the  requirements  of  the
         relevant Immigration Rules.

Appeal to the UT

      5. The SSHD appealed against the FTT's decision on two  grounds,  with
         permission having been granted by FTT Judge Parkes on 8 April 2020.
           Mr  McVeety  relied  upon  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  written
         submissions dated 23 July 2020.  Mr Sharma relied upon  a  rule  24
         notice / skeleton argument dated 8 March 2021.  Although Mr  Sharma
         did not have the SSHD's written submissions, these were sent to him
         before  Mr  McVeety's  submissions  began  and  he  was  given   an
         opportunity to consider them prior to making his  submissions.   Mr
         Sharma confirmed that he had  sufficient  time  to  address  these.
         Both representatives relied mainly upon  their  respective  written
         submissions; their oral submissions were brief.

      6. I now address the grounds of appeal, the rule  24  notice  and  the
         respective submissions before me.

      7. The FTT clearly concluded at [42] that  Mr  Charania  did  not  act
         dishonestly, having applied the principles  in  Balajigari  v  SSHD
         [2019] EWCA Civ 673 at [41].  The reasons for this  conclusion  are
         to be found at [37] to [40] and are  three-fold.   First,  the  FTT
         found Mr Charania to be generally credible and consistent as to why
         he put the figure of  zero  in  his  2013  tax  return,  which  was
         inaccurate.  Second, the claim in  his  2013  tax  return  that  he
         received zero income was clearly inaccurate because HMRC  confirmed
         that he  received  some  �18,000  from  his  PAYE  employment  with
         Marriott hotels that tax year.  The FTT was satisfied that  at  the
         time of placing zero for his income in the 2013 tax return "he  was
         making a placeholder rather than putting this as a genuine figure".
          Third, Mr Charania was generally disorganised in his tax  affairs.



      8. I pause here to observe that the FTT also noted that the  procedure
         adopted by the SSHD did not afford Mr Charania the  opportunity  to
         explain the anomaly in his tax return, in breach of the SSHD's  own
         guidance on procedural fairness.  I accept Mr  Sharma's  submission
         that this was simply a remark that played no material role  in  the
         credibility findings.  As Mr Sharma observed the full merits appeal
         before the FTT  corrects  the  defects  of  justice  identified  in
         Balajigari - see  Ashfaq  (Balajigari:  appeals)  [2020]  UKUT  226
         (IAC).  It follows that I do not consider that the  SSHD  has  made
         out ground 2, and the FTT's observation at [41] does not constitute
         a material error of law.

      9. I now return to the SSHD's ground 1 wherein it was  submitted  that
         the FTT's reasoning did not address the SSHD's fundamental concerns
         regarding Mr Charania's evidence as  articulated  in  the  decision
         letter, by way of  cross-examination  and  in  the  submissions  on
         behalf of the SSHD.  These clearly indicate that the  SSHD  was  of
         the view that Mr Charania failed to explain why he did not  use  an
         accountant at the time of his 2013 tax return or why he delayed  in
         excess of three years before correcting the inaccurate  declaration
         that he earned zero income in the tax year ending 2013.

     10. Although the FTT found Mr Charania to be generally credible in that
         he  gave  consistent  evidence  at  [37],  the   FTT   demonstrably
         appreciated the need to explain why he was found to be credible and
         sought to do so by making two additional points at [39]  and  [40].
         I am satisfied that notwithstanding the findings at [37]  to  [40],
         fairness demanded that the FTT was required to address two  of  the
         SSHD's key concerns regarding  the  credibility  of  Mr  Charania's
         evidence: (i) his explanation for not using an accountant  for  his
         2013 tax return; (ii) his explanation for the delay of  some  three
         years in correcting the 2013 tax return.  I entirely accept that it
         is unnecessary for FTT decisions to rehearse every detail or  issue
         raised by the parties.  It  is  however  necessary  for  judges  to
         identify and resolve key conflicts in the evidence and  explain  in
         clear and brief terms so that parties can understand why they  have
         won or lost.  In my judgment the SSHD has not  been  provided  with
         tolerably clear reasons why the  FTT  was  prepared  to  accept  Mr
         Charania's evidence in these two key respects.

     11. Mr Sharma correctly submitted that there  was  nothing  in  law  to
         require an individual to engage an accountant when  completing  his
         or her tax return.  However, that misses  the  point  made  by  the
         SSHD.  Mr  Charania  submitted  his  initial  2013  tax  return  in
         November 2013 [E2 of the Home Office bundle].   He  had  relatively
         recently (as part of his Tier 1 application for  further  leave  to
         remain dated 10 June 2013) employed the services of an  accountant,
         who provided him with a  letter  and  accounts  [C4-C6  of  the  HO
         bundle].   The  proposition  advanced  by  the  SSHD  was  that  Mr
         Charania's explanation that  he  was  too  stressed  /  emotionally
         drained  to  use  an  accountant  for  his  2013  tax  return   was
         inconsistent with the fact that a few months  earlier  he  used  an
         accountant  for  his  immigration  application.   The   immigration
         application demanded evidence from an accountant to evidence  self-
         employment.  The tax  return  did  not  require  anything  from  an
         interpreter.  However, the appellant offered no explanation for not
         using an accountant (at a time when he said  he  was  stressed  and
         busy) when he plainly had access to one who was familiar  with  his
         self-employment.

     12. Mr Sharma's written submissions asserted that this concern was  not
         put to Mr Charania during cross-examination on the basis that  this
         has not been recorded by the FTT at [19] to [24].   Mr  Sharma  was
         prepared to accept that the judge's record of proceedings  included
         a question on this issue, which I read out for the benefit  of  the
         representatives: "Q Why not use an accountant? A: I should have but
         I didn't. I got an  accountant's  help  to  prepare  amended  self-
         assessment....".  This is also a point that was specifically relied
         upon in submissions (see [26] of the FTT's decision).  The FTT  did
         not engage with this at all when giving its reasons.

     13. Perhaps more significantly, the FTT gave no reasons  for  rejecting
         the SSHD's submission in the decision letter and  repeated  at  the
         hearing that  "the  delay  of  several  years  in  correcting  your
         declarations to HMRC,  shows  that  you  had  little  intention  of
         correcting the errors promptly and as such, have little respect for
         the United Kingdom (UK)  tax  laws".   The  record  of  proceedings
         demonstrates that questions were put in  cross-examination  on  the
         delay issue: "Q: Why did it take you until 2016 to correct it? A: I
         had to get my head around it not to make mistakes. Q: But  you  did
         not do it immediately? A: No. I just wasn't in the  mental  frame."
         This is summarised at [21]  of  the  FTT's  decision.   I  note  Mr
         Charania's own evidence before the FTT that he continued to work on
         a full-time basis at all material times  and  the  absence  of  any
         evidence that his "mental frame" adversely impacted other parts  of
         his working life, other than his tax arrangements.  I also  invited
         Mr Sharma to take me to the evidence before the FTT to explain what
         triggered Mr Charania to amend the 2013 tax return some three years
         later in 2016.  He took me to B1 of the Home Office bundle in which
         Mr Charania was pointing out in 2017 that his amendment of the 2013
         tax return in 2016 was 'unprompted'.  I note that his  response  to
         the SSHD's  tax  questionnaire  [D4  of  the  Home  Office  bundle]
         suggests that the error in the tax return was pointed  out  by  his
         accountant.  Mr Sharma submitted that it was open  to  the  FTT  to
         accept the explanation that  he  was  not  in  a  mental  state  to
         complete the 2013 tax return and was "making a placeholder" with  a
         view to correcting the tax return  at  a  later  point.   That  was
         indeed the clear finding of the FTT.  However the  FTT's  reasoning
         is entirely silent on what was perhaps the key concern on the  part
         of the SSHD - there was no credible  explanation  for  a  delay  of
         three years in correcting the tax return.  In my  judgment  it  was
         incumbent upon the FTT to provide at least brief reasons as to  why
         it accepted the evidence that Mr Charania  was  so  overwhelmed  by
         personal matters that he forgot to declare and pay  his  tax  until
         2016, and to engage with what triggered the amendment to  the  2013
         tax return in  2016,  particularly  in  the  light  of  the  SSHD's
         asserted chronology of events at [7]  of  the  written  submissions
         (and in the chronology within the decision letter).  As set out  in
         R (Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))  [2018]
         UKUT 384 (IAC) when considering whether or not  an  individual  was
         dishonest or merely careless the decision-maker must  consider  the
         stage at which the individual took steps to  remedy  the  situation
         and the explanation for any  significant  delay,  as  well  as  the
         extent to which this is evidenced (as opposed to asserted).

Conclusion

     14. The failure to adequately reason its credibility findings call into
         question the FTT's ultimate  conclusion  that  there  was  not  the
         requisite dishonest conduct to engage paragraph 322(5).  It is  not
         in my judgment realistically possible to construct what the judge's
         view of the appellant's explanation might have been if those errors
         had not been made.  The findings of fact are infected  by  material
         errors of law.

Disposal

     15. The findings of fact need to be remade de  novo.   I  am  satisfied
         that the  relevant  Practice  Statement  and  overriding  objective
         support a remittal to the FTT.

     16. This is a case in which the FTT would  be  assisted  by  an  agreed
         chronology that cross-references to the relevant  documents  in  an
         agreed consolidated bundle and I have made  that  direction  below.
         Upon remittal the FTT can consider that chronology with a  view  to
         making appropriate case management directions.  The SSHD sought  to
         place reliance upon the suspicious timing of the 2016 amendment  to
         the 2013 tax return.  It is important to have a full chronology for
         the period 2013 to 2017 and all the relevant documentation for that
         period.  The papers available to the FTT did not appear to have the
         original 2013 tax return or the documents relevant to the first ILR
         application or the documents / evidence  that  triggered  the  2016
         amendment to the 2013 tax return.

Decision

     17. I allow the appeal and set aside the FTT decision.   The matter  is
         remitted to a FTT judge other than FTT Judge Isaacs.

Directions

      1) Within 21 days of the date this decision is  served  the  appellant
         shall file and serve an agreed (if  possible)  consolidated  bundle
         containing an agreed (if possible) chronology that cross-references
         to page numbers within the consolidated bundle.
