                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 15th December 1976.  She
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge Fisher) who in a determination promulgated  on  31st  July  2013
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the decision of the Respondent
    made on 4th December 2012 to refuse her admission to the United Kingdom
    as a family member of an EEA national.

The Procedural Background to the Appeal

 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 15th December 1976.  On
    6th August 2009 she married Khalil Hussain, a British citizen  born  on
    8th January 1974.  In 2009 he was arrested for drugs  offences.   Prior
    to his court appearance, he  fled  to  Pakistan  where  he  decided  to
    settle.  In August 2009 he married the Appellant  and  their  daughter,
    Sania was born on 22nd September 2010.  Sania is a British citizen.

 3. Mr Hussain returned to the United Kingdom on the grounds  that  he  was
    unable to find work or provide for his  family.   He  returned  to  the
    United Kingdom in January 2012.   On  2nd  July  2012  Mr  Hussain  was
    sentenced at  Derby  Crown  Court  to  five  years  and  seven  months'
    imprisonment for criminal offences of possession with intent to  supply
    and a concurrent sentence of twelve months for dangerous  driving.   He
    was also disqualified from driving for two years.  It is common  ground
    that he will be eligible for release on licence on 27th June  2014  and
    the sentence will expire (including the  licence  conditions)  on  24th
    August 2017.

 4. On 8th November 2012 the  Appellant  applied  for  admission  into  the
    United Kingdom as a family member of an EEA national.  Whilst the  form
    is signed 16th November it was made on 8th November.   The  application
    was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer in a notice  of  immigration
    decision dated 4th December 2012.  The Grounds of  Refusal  state  that
    the Appellant nor the child  has  ever  lived  or  visited  the  United
    Kingdom and have given no valid reason why they believe the UK was  the
    best place for the child.  It was further asserted that  the  Appellant
    had resided in Pakistan for many months without her husband  and  would
    not have his support for several years due to his imprisonment.  It was
    further said that the Appellant had a family support unit  in  Pakistan
    and it was her choice rather than necessity for wishing to live in  the
    United Kingdom.  Thus the Entry Clearance  Officer  was  not  satisfied
    that her right to family life would be  affected  by  the  decision  to
    refuse her entry clearance.  It was further refused on the  basis  that
    her husband living in the UK was not exercising treaty rights  and  was
    not economically viable as he was in prison.  Thus the application  was
    refused.

 5. The Appellant sought permission to appeal that decision and the  appeal
    came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fisher) on 15th  July  2013.
    In a determination promulgated on 31st July 2013 he considered the  EEA
    Regulations and in  particular  Regulation  15A  and  the  decision  in
    Zambrano v Office National de l'Emploi (ONEm) [2011] All ER (EC) 4.  He
    noted that the Appellant would satisfy the criteria  for  a  derivative
    right of residence if she was the primary carer of a  British  citizen,
    the relevant British citizen is residing in the UK and would be  unable
    to reside in the UK or in another EEA state if her carer were  required
    to leave.  The judge accepted that the Appellant was the primary  carer
    of Sania her daughter but  reached  the  conclusion  that  because  her
    daughter was not residing in the United Kingdom she could not meet  the
    Regulations (see paragraph 12  of  the  decision).   He  was  also  not
    satisfied that she would be able  to  reside  in  the  UK  without  her
    mother.  Thus he dismissed the appeal under the  EEA  Regulations.   He
    went on to consider the appeal under  Article  8  but  found  that  the
    decision was a proportionate one and not a breach of Article 8 for  the
    reasons given at paragraphs 14 to 18.

 6. Application for permission to appeal was made on 27th  August  2013  on
    the  grounds  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  by  rejecting  the
    Appellant's case under the Zambrano principles, that he  had  erred  in
    law in his findings that the Appellant would be able to reside  in  the
    United Kingdom and his assessment under Article 8.

 7. Permission to appeal that decision was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Grant) on 9th September 2013.

 8. On 23rd September 2013 the Secretary of State responded to the  Grounds
    of Appeal under Rule 24.  It  was  noted  in  that  response  that  the
    Respondent did not oppose the application for permission to appeal  and
    invited the Tribunal  "to  determine  the  appeal  with  a  fresh  oral
    (continuance) hearing."  It was  noted  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepted that there was a material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Judge's approach to the case under the  Zambrano  principles.   It  was
    conceded that the Appellant can in principle rely on Zambrano  even  if
    the child has never lived within the EU.

 9. Thus the appeal came before  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Ms  Khan,  Counsel
    appeared on behalf of the Appellant.   Mr  Diwncyz,  Senior  Presenting
    Officer appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State.   It  was  agreed
    between the parties that in the light of the grounds  as  submitted  on
    behalf of the Appellant in which the Respondent had accepted that there
    was an error of law that it was necessary to hear the evidence  of  the
    witnesses Zabina Akhtar and Mr Mohamed Salim.  The  Grounds  of  Appeal
    had made reference to the findings made in relation to Sania  when  the
    evidence had been unchallenged.  Thus the Tribunal heard evidence  from
    both of those witnesses.  Ms Akhtar  relied  upon  her  statement  (see
    pages 9 to 11 dated 3rd July 2013).  In her oral evidence she confirmed
    that the Appellant was her maternal uncle's wife and that she  had  met
    the Appellant in 1986, 1993 and in 2013 when she visited Pakistan for a
    one month visit.  During that visit she also met her daughter Sania  as
    they stayed together for the duration of the visit.  She confirmed that
    the Appellant and her daughter live on  their  own  but  have  extended
    family around them.

10. In her statement  at  paragraph  2  she  stated  that  the  Appellant's
    daughter was "inseparable from her mother.  She would not go to  anyone
    but her mother.  They were very close and Sania is  extremely  attached
    to her."  She was asked in her evidence about  that  description.   The
    witness said that Sania was "like a shadow, everywhere her mother  went
    she followed her."  Her mother could not even fill  her  plate  without
    her being near her.  She also  described  that  Sania  slept  with  her
    mother.  She was asked during the visit whether or not she had tried to
    engage with Sania and she said that she had tried by  taking  her  toys
    and a book but she was not prepared to interact with her.   When  asked
    why she was so attached to her mother, the witness  could  not  give  a
    reason other than to say that it is possible that she was close to  her
    father and then her father disappeared leaving her only with her mother
    and that may be a reason for the close  attachment.   When  asked  what
    would happen if separated from her mother, she said that she would  "be
    traumatised and cry nonstop".  She said that her uncle Salim  had  gone
    annually and he had noticed a bond with her mother.  She was  asked  if
    she would be able to care for Sania in the United Kingdom.  The witness
    said that she could not as she worked full-time and that she had made a
    conscious decision not to have children  and  that  her  life  was  not
    ordered with  that  in  mind.   She  said  that  her  family  lived  in
    Huddersfield in Bradford and that it would be very difficult for her to
    look after Sania.  As to other family members, she  said  she  did  not
    think there was anyone who could look after her; her uncle  worked  and
    her aunt had two grandchildren.  She gave a description of the house by
    reference to the photographs at pages 6 and 7 noting the house was old,
    single storey and had not been cared for and was  in  a  bad  state  of
    repair.  She said she had seen that on her visit.

11. In relation to her  own  circumstances  she  confirmed  that  they  had
    changed since her statement, that she still worked  full-time  but  had
    taken on an additional job as a PA for BUPA  with  a  gross  income  of
    �24,500.  She estimated that her income per annum was �43,000 which was
    not dissimilar to what was at paragraph  4.   She  confirmed  that  she
    would still be willing to provide between �70 to �100 per week for  the
    Appellant should she enter the United Kingdom.

12. In cross-examination she was asked about the house in Pakistan  and  it
    was put that the house was not that old and that it could be  repaired.
    The witness agreed that it was feasible to repair it if there was money
    available.  As  to  Sania's  father,  in  reference  to  the  witness's
    evidence that he would  be  able  to  obtain  employment  once  he  was
    released, it is put that as he had served a sentence for drugs offences
    he may find it difficult.  The witness said  that  she  would  consider
    giving him financial support also.  As to employment she explained that
    stigma in the community was not the same and that he has  in  the  past
    had employment having worked for a tyre company in Bradford and that it
    is likely that he would be able to obtain employment.  The evidence  in
    relation to that was that he had been working  at  a  tyre  company  in
    Bradford, Vertis  Printing  Firm  and  had  done  a  brief  stint  with
    Thorntons; working both pre and post conviction.

13. The next witness was Mr Mohamed Salim.  He had provided a letter in the
    Respondent's bundle dated 29th October 2012.  He adopted  the  contents
    of the letter.  In addition he confirmed in his evidence-in-chief  that
    he would not be charging the Appellant rent should entry  clearance  be
    granted and that they would live with the  family.   He  said  that  he
    would  not  expect  them  to  contribute  to  the  bills.   As  to  the
    Appellant's husband's work history he was  asked  if  he  knew  of  his
    previous employment.  The witness then produced a  number  of  payslips
    and P45s in relation to his past employment.  Mr Diwncyz did not oppose
    this evidence.  It consisted of a number of payslips from 2001 relating
    to Veritas (printing firm) and 2001 S&........... Limited.  There  were
    P45s for 2004 for Dove Valley Ashburn, 2007 and 2008.

14. In cross-examination he was asked if his situation was still  the  same
    as a letter and he confirmed that it was.  As to the  accommodation  he
    described that he had a four bedroom property and that there  would  be
    one bedroom still empty for the Appellant and Sania.  He also said that
    he would be prepared to put up Khalil (the Appellant's husband)  as  he
    had in the past and he had stayed overnight  on  daily  release  visits
    from prison.  He was then asked if he owned the house outright  and  he
    confirmed that he did.  No further questions were asked.

15. At the conclusion of the evidence I heard submissions from each of  the
    parties.  Mr Diwncyz stated that having had the opportunity  to  cross-
    examine the witnesses and to hear their evidence, there was  no  reason
    to doubt the credibility of the parties; that Ms Akhtar was willing and
    able to provide financial support to the Appellant and her daughter and
    would extend it to the Appellant's husband upon release.  He noted that
    the Appellant had also worked.  He accepted that  the  evidence  of  Ms
    Akhtar in relation to Sania was also credible.  Thus he  accepted  that
    the Appellant had satisfied the EEA Regulations  in  this  case  noting
    that the Appellant was Sania's primary carer, given  her  age  and  the
    attachment to her daughter.

16. Ms Khan relied on her skeleton  argument  noting  that  it  was  common
    ground that Sania's mother was her primary  carer.   It  was  now  also
    accepted that the evidence demonstrated that there was an attachment to
    her mother that no-one else would be able to undertake  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Her father being detained at least until the end of 2014 when
    the licence period began.  It was accepted also that Ms  Akhtar  was  a
    credible witness and that she was unable to care for Sania and that her
    evidence concerning this strong attachment between  the  Appellant  and
    her  daughter  may  be  due  to  the  circumstances  of  her   father's
    disappearance.  There were no other family relatives available and thus
    she satisfied Regulation 15A(iva...........).

Conclusions

17. There is no dispute about the evidence in  this  case.   It  is  common
    ground that the Appellant is the main carer of her daughter Sania.  The
    previous evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal also had  not
    been challenged.  Mr Diwncyz after having cross-examined both witnesses
    accepted that they were both credible witnesses and that  the  evidence
    demonstrated that there was a strong attachment between  the  Appellant
    and  her  daughter  not  only  by  reason  of  her  age  but  of  their
    relationship and that in those circumstances there was no other  family
    member in the United Kingdom who would be able to care for Sania if she
    entered the United Kingdom.

18. As I say the evidence is accepted.  The evidence of Ms Akhtar which was
    entirely credible paid regard to the relationship between the Appellant
    and her daughter.  She had viewed the  relationship  herself  during  a
    month long visit and found that it was striking in  the  way  that  the
    child would not leave her mother.  She described her as inseparable not
    only in terms of wishing to be with her which is entirely natural for a
    young child of that age but also that she slept with her mother and did
    not wish to interact with other adults.  It is perhaps  not  surprising
    that she has her main and significant attachment to  her  mother  given
    her tender years and that is the usual attachment in a  child  of  that
    age.  However a further reason was also posed  by  the  witness  namely
    that she had been  close  to  her  father  and  that  he  had  suddenly
    disappeared leaving only her mother.  That may also provide  a  further
    explanation for the significant attachment that there  appeared  to  be
    between the mother and daughter.

19. It is further accepted evidence that to expect Sania  to  exercise  her
    rights as a British citizen by residing in the United Kingdom away from
    her mother would be likely to cause  her  harm  and  distress.   Whilst
    there are other relatives living in the United Kingdom, it would not be
    reasonable to expect that they would be able to undertake the  care  of
    this child  given  her  significant  attachment  to  her  mother.   The
    evidence is that Ms Akhtar, who works full-time and has no children  of
    her  own  would  not  be  able  to  look  after  Sania  given  her  own
    commitments.  Mr Salim and his wife also  have  their  own  commitments
    including two grandchildren for whom they care and also Mr Salim is  in
    employment.  Even if it were feasible that such relatives would be able
    to  care,  that  would  fail  to  take  into  account  the  significant
    attachment between mother and daughter the breaking of which would lead
    to distress and harm.

20. There was also no dispute that Ms Akhtar is willing  and  available  to
    provide financial assistance for the Appellant and Sania of between �70
    to �100 per week.  She had provided all of her financial  documentation
    and this was accepted by the Respondent.

21. I turn to the law.  EC Directive 2004/38/EC ("the Citizens  Directive")
    grants rights to EU citizens,  and  to  any  "family  member"  of  such
    citizens (defined as a spouse or partner of the EU citizen,  or  direct
    minor  and/or  dependent  descendant  or  direct  dependent  descendant
    relative of the EU citizen or his/her spouse or partner - but not a non-
    dependent ascendant relative).   As  a  matter  of  domestic  law,  the
    Citizens  Directive  is  given  effect  by  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  [SI  2006  No.  1003]   ("the   EEA
    Regulations").

22. Article 20 of the Treaty on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union
    ("TFEU") provides that every national of a member  state  should  be  a
    citizen of the EU, and shall have the right to move and  reside  freely
    within the territory of the member states.

23. Article 20 of the TFEU is in the following terms:

         "1.  Citizenship of the Union is hereby established.  Every  person
             holding the nationality of a member state shall be  a  citizen
             of the Union.  Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to
             and not replace national citizenship.

         2.   Citizens of the Union shall enjoy the rights  and  subject  to
             the duties provided for in the Treaties.   They  shall,  inter
             alia:

             (a)  The right to move and reside freely within the  territory
                  of the member states;

             (b)  ...

             (c)  ...

             (d)  ...

             These  rights  shall  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the
             conditions and limits defined  by  the  treaties  and  by  the
             measures adopted thereunder."

24. In Ruiz Zambrano v The Office National de l'Emploi (ONEm) [2011] All ER
    (EC) 491, the CJEU confirmed that Article 20 of the TFEU conferred  the
    status of citizen of the union on every person holding the  nationality
    of a member state.

25. The CJEU's decision in Zambrano has been  considered  in  a  number  of
    decisions of the CJEU: McCarthy v the SSHD  [2011]  All  ER  (EC)  729;
    Dereci and Others v the Bundesministerum fur Inners [2012] All ER  (EC)
    373; O and S v Maahanmuuttovirasto [2012] EUECJ C-356/11  and  C-356/12
    and Yoshikazu Iida v Stadt Ulm [2012] EUECJ C-40/11; and by  the  Court
    of Appeal in Harrison (Jamaica) and AB (Morocco) v the SSHD [2012] EWCA
    Civ 1736.

26. In the decision of Jamil Sanneh v (1) Secretary of State for  Work  and
    Pensions and (2)  the  Commissioners  for  Her  Majesty's  Revenue  and
    Customs [2013] EWHC 793 (Admin) gave  a  summary  of  the  decision  in
    Zambrano and other decisions of the CJEU.  In that decision it stated:-

         "(i) All nationals of all member states are EU citizens.  It is for
             each member state to determine how nationality of  that  state
             may be acquired, but once it is  acquired  by  an  individual,
             that individual has the right to enjoy the  substance  of  the
             rights that attach to the status of EU citizen, including  the
             right to reside in the territory  of  the  EU.   That  applies
             equally to minors, irrespective of the  nationality  of  their
             parents, and irrespective of whether one or both parents  have
             EU citizenship.

         (ii) An EU citizen must have the freedom  to  enjoy  the  right  to
             reside in the EU, genuinely and in  practice.   For  a  minor,
             that freedom may be jeopardised if, although legally  entitled
             to reside in the EU, he is compelled  to  leave  EU  territory
             because an ascendant relative upon whom  he  is  dependent  is
             compelled to leave.  That relative may be compelled  to  leave
             by dint of direct state action (e.g. he is the subject  of  an
             order for removal) or by virtue of being driven to  leave  and
             reside in a non-EU country by force of economic necessity  (by
             having insufficient resources to  provide  for  his  EU  child
             because the state refuses him a work permit).  The  rights  of
             an EU child will not be infringed if he is  not  compelled  to
             leave.  Therefore, even where a non-EU ascendant  relative  is
             compelled to leave EU territory, the Article 20 rights  of  an
             EU child will not be infringed if there is  another  ascendant
             relative who has the right of residence in the EU, and who can
             and will in practice care for the child.

         (iii)    It is for the national courts to determine, as a  question
             of fact on the evidence before it, whether an EU citizen  will
             be compelled to leave the EU to follow a non-EU national  upon
             whom he is dependent.

         (iv) Nothing less than such compulsion will engage Articles 20  and
             21 of the TFEU.  In particular, EU law  will  not  be  engaged
             where the EU citizen is not compelled to leave the EU, even if
             the  quality  or  standard  of  life  of  the  EU  citizen  is
             diminished as a result if the non-EU national upon whom he  is
             dependent is (for example) removed or prevented from  working;
             although (a) diminution in the quality of life might engage EU
             law if (and only if) it is sufficient in  practice  to  compel
             the relevant ascendant relative, and hence  the  EU  dependent
             citizen,  to  leave  and  (b)  such  actions  as  removal   or
             prevention of work may result in  an  interference  with  some
             other right, such as the right  to  respect  for  family  life
             under Article 8 of the ECHR.

         (v)  Although such Article 8 rights are similar in scope to the  EU
             rights confirmed by Article 7 of the  Charter  of  Fundamental
             Rights of the European Union, the provisions  of  the  Charter
             are addressed to member states only when they are implementing
             EU law.  If EU law is not engaged, then  the  domestic  courts
             have to undertake the examination of the right to family  life
             under Article 8; but that is  an  entirely  distinct  area  of
             protection.

         (vi) The overriding of the general national right to refuse a  non-
             EU  national  a  right  to  residence,  by  reference  to  the
             effective employment of the right to reside of a dependent  EU
             citizen, is  described  in  both  Dereci  (paragraph  67)  and
             Harrison  (paragraph  66)  as  'exceptional',  meaning  as   a
             principle, it will not be regularly engaged."

27. In the decision of the Upper Tribunal MA and SM (Zambrano): EU children
    outside EU (Iran) [2013] UKUT 000380 (IAC) stated this in the  headnote
    of that decision:-

         "(i) In EU law terms  there  is  no  reason  why  the  decision  in
             Zambrano could not in principle be relied upon by the  parent,
             or other primary carer, of a minor EU national living  outside
             the EU as long as it  is  the  intention  of  the  parent,  or
             primary carer to accompany the EU national  child  to  his/her
             country of nationality, in the instant appeals that being  the
             United Kingdom.  To  conclude  otherwise  would  deny  access,
             without justification, to a whole  class  of  EU  citizens  to
             rights they are entitled to by virtue of their citizenship.

         (ii) The  above  conclusion  is  fortified  by  the  terms  of  the
             Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  (Amendment)  (No.  2)
             Regulations 2012 (SI2012/2560),  brought  into  force  on  8th
             November 2012.  Paragraphs 2 and 3  of  the  Schedule  to  the
             Regulations give effect to the CJEU's decision in Zambrano  by
             amending Regulations 11  and  15A  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
             Regulations 2006 in  order  to  confer  rights  of  entry  and
             residence on the primary care of  a  British  citizen  who  is
             joining the British citizen in, or  accompanying  the  British
             citizen to the United Kingdom and where the denial of  such  a
             right of residence will prevent the British citizen from being
             able to reside in the United Kingdom or in an EEA state."

28. There is no dispute as to the law as set out above between the parties.
     In the light of the Regulations being amended to take account  of  the
    principles established by  the  case  of  Zambrano,  the  amendment  to
    Regulation 11 (right of admission to the United Kingdom) now  reads  as
    follows:-

         "Regulation 11 Rights of Admission to the United Kingdom

         [(5) A person ("P") meets the criteria in this paragraph where -

         ...

         [(e) P is accompanying a British citizen to, or joining  a  British
             citizen in, the United Kingdom and  P  would  be  entitled  to
             reside in the United Kingdom pursuant  to  Regulation  15A(4A)
             were P and the British citizen both in the United Kingdom.]

29. Regulation 15 was also amended to  include  15A  derivative  rights  of
    residence.  It is conceded on behalf of  the  Respondent  that  in  the
    light of the evidence in this  appeal  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
    requirements of Regulation 11(5)(e) and thus meets the requirements  of
    Regulation 15A(4A).  The Appellant is Sania's primary carer  and  meets
    the definition of Regulation 15A(7)(a)  as  Sania's  mother  she  is  a
    direct  relative  and  under   15A(7)(b)(i)   she   has   the   primary
    responsibility for Sania's care which she does not share with any other
    relative.  Furthermore it is accepted evidence that in the light of the
    attachment between mother and daughter that there is  no  other  family
    member able to care for Sania and in those circumstances the  Appellant
    has demonstrated that she meets the EEA Regulations.

Decision

30. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  The decision is set aside.  The decision is re-made
    as follows:- the appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations.
