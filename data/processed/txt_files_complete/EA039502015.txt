Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr O Ngwuocha, instructed by Carl Martin Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this appeal the Secretary of State is the  appellant  and  to  avoid
    confusion I refer to her throughout as being, "the claimant".

2.   The respondent is a citizen of Nigeria, who was born on  24th  December
    1973.

3.    On  8th  December  2016,  the  claimant   refused   the   respondent's
    application for a residence card as evidence of  a  retained  right  of
    residence in the United Kingdom as the former spouse of [LM], a  Polish
    national exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

4.   The respondent entered the United Kingdom on 19th July 2003 and was  in
    possession of a student visa valid between  11th  June  2003  and  31st
    August 2004.  Thereafter, the respondent obtained successive extensions
    of her student leave until 30th April 2010.

5.   On 15th May 2010, the respondent married [LM] ("the appellant's  former
    spouse") in the United Kingdom and  on  18th  February  2011,  she  was
    granted an EEA residence card valid until 18th February 2016.

6.   Sadly, on 15th May 2014, the respondent was granted a  decree  absolute
    of divorce in proceedings numbered [ ] before the Central Family Court.
     On or about 21st April  2015,  the  respondent  made  the  application
    giving rise to her appeal.  The application was refused on 8th December
    2015, when a decision was  also  made  to  revoke  the  residence  card
    granted on 18th February 2011, with reference to  Regulation  20(2)  of
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  ("the  2006
    Regulations").

7.    Following  representations  from  the  respondent's   solicitors   the
    revocation of the respondent's residence card decision was revised  and
    the respondent was subsequently issued  with  a  residence  card  valid
    between 30th August 2016 and 30th August 2021.

8.   Having heard evidence and  submissions,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M
    Hembrough  noted  correspondence  in  the  respondent's  bundle   which
    included an HMRC self assessment income tax statement dated April 2014,
    which showed that the former sponsor had  made  a  payment  towards  an
    outstanding balance on 11th  April,  2014.   There  was  also  an  HMRC
    statement in relation to the former sponsor's self-employed class 2 NIC
    contributions dated 14th  December  2014,  showing  a  payment  due  of
    �74.25.  An income tax calculation for the year ended 5th  April  2015,
    showed that the former sponsor had declared taxable income of �7,822 in
    that year which straggles the point of divorce.   The  judge  found  at
    paragraph 16 of  the  determination  that  she  was  satisfied  to  the
    requisite standard that the  former  spouse  had  been  exercising  EEA
    treaty rights as at the point of divorce.  The divorce was on 15th  May
    2014.

9.   At paragraph 17 of the determination the judge went on to say that  for
    the avoidance of doubt  she  also  recorded  that  the  respondent  had
    presented P60s in her own name for the years 2014  to  2016  and  other
    correspondence which showed that she was economically active in each of
    those years.  The judge found herself satisfied that the respondent met
    the requirements of Regulation 10(6) and allowed the appeal.

10.  Dissatisfied with  the  judge's  decision,  the  claimant  applied  for
    permission to appeal which was granted.  The basis of  the  application
    was that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had allowed the  appeal  on  the
    misunderstanding about  what  the  appeal  concerned.   The  judge  had
    restricted herself only to making findings on whether the  respondent's
    former spouse was exercising treaty rights as at the date  of  divorce.
    However, the grounds point out that this was not  in  dispute  and  the
    respondent has a  residence  card  valid  until  2021  recognising  her
    retained right of residence.  However, the application was made and the
    subsequent  refusal  by  the  claimant  was  in  respect  of  permanent
    residence.  In the refusal letter of 8th December  2016,  the  claimant
    indicated that she had not been  provided  with  any  evidence  of  the
    respondent's former spouse exercising treaty rights  between  2010  and
    2012 and the judge had not made any  findings  on  the  central  issue,
    despite highlighting the issue in paragraph  8  of  the  determination.
    The respondent's representative told me that it was not  necessary  for
    the Immigration Judge to make a finding on whether or  not  the  former
    spouse was exercising treaty rights in 2012.

11.  Relying on the grounds of appeal,  Mr  Wilding  reminded  me  that  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal was in March 2017.  At that time
    the respondent was required to show  a  five  year  period  before  the
    hearing when the former spouse had been exercising treaty rights.   The
    judge had made no findings at all on any five  year  period,  simply  a
    finding in respect of 2014 when the parties  divorced.   There  was  no
    finding as to the period before April 2014 as to the  spouse's  status.
    The evidence purported to cover the  period  2012/2013  and  2013/2014.
    There was no evidence to cover the period 2010/011 or  2011/2012.   The
    appeal was on recognition of permanent residence,  but  the  judge  had
    failed to understand and appreciate this.

12.  For the respondent, Mr Ngwuocha submitted that the point  made  by  the
    claimant was considered by the judge, because the  bundle  of  evidence
    before the judge contained evidence that the respondent's former spouse
    was exercising treaty rights in May 2014.   Going  back  there  was  no
    dispute as to the evidence provided as to the tax years  2012/2013  and
    2013/2014.  The judge considered the evidence in paragraphs 15, 16  and
    17 of the determination.  At pages 16, 17 and 18  of  the  respondent's
    bundle there was clear evidence that her former spouse  was  exercising
    treaty rights.  There was a letter  dated  14  December  2014  from  HM
    Revenue and Customs addressed to him requesting payment of �74.25.   It
    was said to be in respect of his liability to pay tax  for  the  period
    6th April 2014 to 11th October 2014.  At page 17 was a  self-assessment
    statement addressed to the  former  spouse  dated  April  2014  and  it
    referred to a payment being made by him of income  tax  on  11th  April
    2014.  It also showed a 30 days' late penalty for 2012/2013 of �49  and
    at page 18 of the respondent's bundle is  a  self-assessment  statement
    dated March 2014 addressed to the former spouse showing a payment  made
    by him on 27th November 2013, of �100 and a balance remaining  for  the
    year 2012/13  of  �978.79.   The  fact  that  the  former  sponsor  was
    registered as being  self-employed  as  evidenced  by  these  documents
    clearly indicates, Mr Ngwuocha submitted, that the  former  spouse  was
    exercising treaty rights.  As long as he was always registered as being
    self-employed and in the United Kingdom it follows, he submitted,  that
    he must have been exercising treaty rights.

13.  Responding briefly, Mr Wilding suggested that  this  submission  cannot
    be correct.  What the respondent has to show is a continuous period  of
    five years during which her former spouse has  been  exercising  treaty
    rights.  The judge in the judge's determination did not  consider  this
    issue at all.  The five year period in question could be any five  year
    period and it could be the period ending on the  date  of  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  What the judge looked at was  payments
    made in 2014.  The fact that a tax return has been made in a particular
    period does not necessarily mean that the subject of the tax return  is
    still exercising treaty rights and that is the issue which  this  judge
    failed to grapple with and which the respondent has failed to prove.  I
    reserved my decision.

14.  The judge noted the Reasons for Refusal Letter which  in  the  material
    section is as follows:-

         "You have submitted three HMRC  tax  calculations  on  various  NIC
         statements for [LM] covering the financial years  2009/10,  2012/13
         and 2013/14.


         However, as you have provided no evidence to demonstrate  how  [LM]
         was exercising treaty rights during the years 2010/11 and  2011/12.
         You have failed to show that your EEA national  former  spouse  was
         continuing to exercise free movement rights  up  to  the  point  of
         divorce."

15.  The judge was clearly satisfied on the evidence that  the  respondent's
    former spouse was continuing to exercise free movements up to the point
    of divorce but failed to appreciate that the respondent was required to
    show a full five  year  period  during  which  the  former  spouse  was
    exercising free movement rights.

16.  I am afraid I disagree with the suggestion  made  by  the  respondent's
    solicitor that if someone  is  registered  with  HMRC  as  being  self-
    employed and in the United Kingdom, then  they  are  exercising  treaty
    rights.  It is possible, for example, for someone  to  have  registered
    during a particular tax year as being self-employed but to  have  given
    up  their  self-employment  because  they  were  simply   not   earning
    sufficient money, but still to be registered  as  self-employed.   They
    may then  have  become  an  employee,  they  may  then  have  become  a
    jobseeker, but without evidence that they were actually continuing with
    the self-employment, one can only speculate how  they  were  exercising
    treaty rights.  The determination does contain  a  void  and  for  that
    reason is defective.

17.  The judge fell into error.  As  a  result,  I  set  aside  the  judge's
    determination.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of  evidence  showing  a
    complete five year period during which the respondent's  former  spouse
    was exercising treaty rights.  I have decided to  remake  the  decision
    myself.  I find that the respondent has failed to discharge the  burden
    of proof upon her and her appeal is dismissed.
