     Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of India,  born  on  28th  May  1984.  His
      appeal against the decision of the respondent dated 16th April 2014 to
      refuse his application for leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur) Migrant was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Narayan in a determination promulgated on 12th July 2014.  The  appeal
      was determined on the papers.


   2. He found that the appellant was not entitled to any points in  respect
      of attributes and access to funds as required under the rules.


   3. On 1st September 2014, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Page  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal. He found the  determination  confusing
      to read.  Paragraph 14 ran into nearly two pages.  Without identifying
      any particular arguable error of law, Judge Page  simply  stated  that
      given the complexity of the  issues  raised  in  the  application  for
      permission, this was a case  where  permission  to  appeal  should  be
      granted.


   4. Ms Nizami, on behalf of the appellant, gave notice of  the  withdrawal
      of the appellant's case. This she did orally at the hearing.


   5. Mr Walker did not oppose the giving of such notice of withdrawal.


   6. Pursuant to paragraph 17(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
      Rules 2008, I consent to the withdrawal.


   7. In the circumstances, the Upper Tribunal must  notify  each  party  in
      writing of the withdrawal of the appellant's case under Rule 17 of the
      2008 Rules.







                               Signed
