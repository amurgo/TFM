For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                         Determination and Decision

1.   This matter comes before me for consideration as to whether or not  the
    determination discloses a material error of law.

2.   In a determination  promulgated  on  30  July  2014  before  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Doran) the appellant's  appeal  against  a  refusal  to
    grant him leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  was
    dismissed.  The Tribunal also dismissed  the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds and confirmed  that  the  issue  of  removal  directions  under
    Section 47 of the 2006 Act was lawful.

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and  his  date  of  birth  is  7
    October 1985.

Background

4.    The  Secretary  of  State  considered  the  application  made  by  the
    appellant on the basis of documentation submitted and thereafter in  an
    interview conducted  on  24  October  2013.   The  respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant's self-employed earnings were credible  as
    they had not been earned by genuine means, as admitted by the appellant
    in interview.  His motivation for that work was to meet the Immigration
    Rules.  Essentially the respondent did not consider that the  responses
    given by the appellant in the  interview  established  that  he  ran  a
    genuine and credible business providing tuition.

5.    In  a  determination  which  set  out  the  appellant's  evidence  and
    submissions made, the findings appear at [36].  In terms of documentary
    evidence the appellant produced invoices, bank statements and accounts.
     The Tribunal undertook a  cross-referencing  exercise  with  each  and
    every invoice produced with the appellant's bank statement.   All  were
    verified, save for  five  invoices  totalling  ï¿½6,710.08,  a  shortfall
    identified  by  the  Tribunal  at  [37].    On  the  basis   of   those
    deficiencies  the  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that  the   appellant
    established in full his claim to previous earnings for  self-employment
    because of the shortfall in his funds.  The Tribunal was not  satisfied
    that the appellant had  undertaken  the  tuition  specified  in  the  5
    invoices.  The Tribunal  then  considered  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy approach.  The Tribunal took into account that the appellant had
    been requested and indeed attended an interview under the provisions of
    paragraph 19(k) of Appendix A of the Immigration  Rules.  The  Tribunal
    found that there was no further obligation on the respondent  to  apply
    evidential flexibility.

6.   The Tribunal considered the application of Article 8 and  followed  the
    approach in Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC).  The Tribunal found nothing in his private life  that
    was exceptional and/or that could not be replicated in Pakistan.  There
    were no arguably good grounds for granting leave outside of  the  Rules
    and no grounds for considering a second stage Article 8 assessment.

Grounds for Permission

7.   Ground 1 - the Tribunal erred in the cross-referencing of the invoices
    against payment dates shown in the appellant's  bank  statements.   All
    five invoices highlighted in [37] are reflected in the bank statements.
     Had the Tribunal not misread the documentary evidence the  outcome  of
    the appeal would have been favourable to the appellant.

8.   Ground 2 - the Tribunal  erred  by  limiting  its  assessment  of  the
    appellant's private life under  paragraph  276ADE.  It  ought  to  have
    considered paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

Permission to Appeal

9.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Coates
    on 2 September 2014.

Error of Law Hearing

10.  At the start of the hearing  Mr  Avery  conceded  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred  in  the  cross-referencing  of  invoices  and  bank
    statements,  which  was  inaccurate.   Mr  Avery  conceded   that   the
    documentary evidence established that all  of  the  invoices  could  be
    cross-referenced and matched with payments made  into  the  appellant's
    bank statements.

11.  Mr Ranshawa submitted that the focus of the determination  was  on  the
    documentary   evidence   and   the   cross-referencing   exercise   was
    significant.  The Tribunal performed this exercise on  the  basis  that
    the appellant was engaged in genuine employment  and  received  genuine
    earnings.

12.  Mr Avery relied on the Reasons for Refusal Letter  in  which  the  main
    concern  was  the  credibility  and  genuineness  of  the   appellant's
    business.

13.  Mr Avery conceded  that  he  was  in  some  difficulty  and  could  not
    realistically support any argument that the determination should stand.
     The Tribunal in his view placed weight on erroneous considerations and
    failed to consider the main  objections  raised  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.

14.  In response  Mr  Ranshawa  argued  that  the  Tribunal's  approach  was
    sustainable particularly in light of all of the  evidence  produced  in
    the appellant's bundle which included independent confirmation  of  his
    accounts and proof of his earnings.

Discussion and Decision

15.  At the hearing before me Mr Ranshawa sought to pursue  only  the  first
    ground of appeal and did not raise the second ground, namely Article 8.
     For the sake of  completeness  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Tribunal's
    consideration of Article 8 issues discloses no material error of law.

16.  Turning to the main ground of appeal, I find that there was a  material
    mistake of fact in the Tribunal's determination such that  the  outcome
    would have been different were it not for the error made.

17.  It was common ground that the Tribunal erred in  the  cross-referencing
    exercise as  between  the  five  invoices  and  bank  statements.   The
    Tribunal was wrong to reach a conclusion that  five  invoices  did  not
    show corresponding payments in the appellant's bank statements.  It  is
    clear from the  determination  that  the  Tribunal  placed  significant
    weight on the documentary evidence before it and made a  clear  finding
    that the cross-referencing exercise performed  established  that  those
    specific invoices could not be verified and that the appellant had  not
    undertaken that specific tuition.

18.  Mr Avery submits  that  the  determination  cannot  stand  because  the
    Tribunal failed  to  engage  with  the  main  concerns  raised  by  the
    respondent in the Reasons for Refusal Letter,  namely  the  genuineness
    and credibility of the appellant's business and earnings  as  evidenced
    in the record of interview. I reject this  submission.  The  respondent
    has not sought to submit grounds of appeal and/or any  cross-appeal  in
    these proceedings relying on those grounds.

19.   I accept the submissions made by Mr Ranshawa.  Although  the  Tribunal
    does  not  specifically  engage  with  the  issue  of  the  appellant's
    credibility, I am satisfied that the Tribunal has looked at all of the
    evidence,  including  the  bundle  of  documentary   evidence   showing
    confirmation of the appellant's income and earnings, together with  the
    evidence of invoices and corresponding bank statements.  In my view the
    Tribunal would not have  engaged  in  such  an  exercise  were  it  not
    satisfied to the appropriate standard of proof that the  appellant  was
    working on a self-employed basis and earning the relevant and specified
    income shown in the documentary evidence.  The clear implication of the
    findings in the determination is  that  in  the  event  of  the  cross-
    referencing exercise proving to be accurate, the Tribunal  intended  to
    make a finding that the appellant had indeed  established  evidence  of
    previous earnings in the total amount.  Accordingly  I  find  that  the
    error made by the Tribunal was material. I find that the appellant  had
    in  fact  adduced  evidence  to  show  he  met  the  previous  earnings
    requirements.

Decision

20.   There was a material error of law.
21.   The determination is set aside.
22.   I remake the decision by substituting a decision to allow  the  appeal
    on immigration grounds.

     No anonymity direction is made.
