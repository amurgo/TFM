                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria. She came to the United Kingdom
      in March 2013, travelling on a spousal dependant Visa. She was
      accompanied by her daughter, [D], born in July 2010. Another daughter,
      [E], was born in the United Kingdom in January 2014.

   2. She made a claim for protection in March 2018. She said she was
      fearful of her husband's family. She said he had converted from Islam
      to Christianity after leaving school and a consequence they held
      greivance. His family also practiced FGM and the appellant claimed she
      feared that they will force this upon her daughter. She also refers to
      the general threat in the country from Boko Haram.

   3. The claim was refused on 24 August 2018.The respondent found the claim
      in relation to her husband's family did not constitute persecutory
      treatment. Regarding FGM, the appellant said she and her husband were
      from the Yoruba tribe and it was accepted the country information
      indicated FGM was prevalent amongst them, with statistics showing over
      50% of women aged between 15 and 49 had undergone the
      procedure.However,the appellant had not undergone this and she and her
      husband were opposed to it.There had been no difficulties in this
      regard whilst she was living in Nigeria. If there were any truth in
      the fear of FGM then the respondent concluded that there was
      sufficiency of protection and localised difficulties could be avoided
      by relocation. No other circumstances were identified that would
      justify the grant of leave.

   4. Regarding Boko Haram, the respondent acknowledged the threat they
      presented but the appellant's fear was non-specific.

   5. Reliance was placed upon section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration
      (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004 and the delay in claiming was
      highlighted.

   6. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge PA Grant Hutchison
      on 2 November 2018 at Glasgow. At the hearing the judge also
      considered medical issues in relation to the appellant and her
      daughter. In a decision promulgated on 19 December 2018 the appeal was
      dismissed.

The Upper Tribunal

   7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
      judge erred in the article 8 assessment, including the consideration
      of the best interests of the children. A specific ground for which
      permission was sought related to the second child's illness. The judge
      accepted the child had sickle-cell disease but concluded it had not
      been shown treatment was unavailable in Nigeria. Permission was not
      granted on this issue given the high threshold for a medical claim to
      succeed.

   8. At hearing, the appellant's representative submitted that the article
      8 assessment, particularly in relation to the children had not been
      properly carried out. He submitted there were compelling
      circumstances. He said this was because the 1st appellant had been
      diagnosed with chorio carcinoma and was being monitored and her
      younger daughter was receiving ongoing treatment in respect of sickle
      cell disease.

   9. In response, Mr Mathews argued that the judge had taken into account
      these factors. The judge had referred to the treatment that would be
      available in Nigeria. They were not qualifying children. The judge at
      paragraph 22 referred to having considered the totality of the
      evidence. The judge accepted that the appellant and her husband had
      developed a private life in the United Kingdom, particularly given
      that her husband was a minister of religion. However, the requirements
      of the immigration rules were not met and the judge saw this as a
      powerful indication when considering matters outside the rules. He
      said they had no legitimate expectation to be allowed to remain.

  10.  Mr Matthews referred me to paragraph 18 and 19 of KO (Nigeria) and
      Others (Appellants) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
      (Respondent) [2018] UKSC 53., This concerned qualifying children
      whereas the children here were not in that category. Para 18 refers to
      the respondent's the IDI guidance and the need to consider where the
      parents are expected to be, since it will normally be reasonable for
      the child to be with them. Para 18 refer to EV (Philippines) v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874 at
      para 58:

           "58.   In my judgment, therefore, the assessment of the best
           interests of the children must be made on the basis that the
           facts are as they are in the real world. If one parent has no
           right to remain, but the other parent does, that is the
           background against which the assessment is conducted. If neither
           parent has the right to remain, then that is the background
           against which the assessment is conducted. Thus the ultimate
           question will be: is it reasonable to expect the child to follow
           the parent with no right to remain to the country of origin?"

  11. In response, Mr Olabamiji said matters had to be assessed in the
      round. They came to the United Kingdom lawfully. The children are now
      enrolled in school.

Consideration

  12. Permission to appeal has been granted on the basis the judge failed to
      properly assess article 8, particularly the best interests of the
      children. Permission was not granted on the 1st ground, which related
      to health.

  13. There are undisputed background facts. The appellant has 2 children,
      [D], born in July 2010 and [E], born in January 2014.Both parents hold
      degrees. The children's father is a minister of religion sponsored by
      his university to study for a doctorate. He states that due to his
      wife's ill-health and concerns about their daughter he was not able to
      complete this. He does hold a Master's degree. The judge accepted he
      had an established private life particularly because of his religious
      works. He came before the appellant arrived in March 2013.She was
      accompanied by their first born, [D]. At that stage she would have
      been just over 2 ï¿½ years of age. [E] was born in the United Kingdom.
      At the time of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge they
      were 8 and 4. The parents are not British nationals and the children
      are not qualifying children. This meant the family could not benefit
      from section 117 B 6.

  14. The leave granted was valid until 30 January 2017. A further leave to
      remain application submitted on 10 February 2017 which was refused on
      1 February 2018. This was then followed by the claim for protection
      made on the same day. The family did not have settled status.

  15. Much of the appeal was taken up with the protection claim. In the
      course of this however details about the family situation where
      established. The judge recorded the submissions, which included
      references to the children. Paragraph 10(e) records the submission
      made by the appellant's representatives in relation to the best
      interests of the children.

At paragraph 20 the judge refers to the appellant's human rights and refers
to considering the totality of the evidence and the submissions made. The
conclusion was that there would be no breach. At paragraph 21 the judge
gives further details in relation to article 8. The immigration rules in
respect of family and private life were not met. The judge accepts that the
appellant and her husband had developed a private life in the United
Kingdom. However, they did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276 ADE.
The judge correctly said this was an important factor in considering
matters outside the rules. The judge pointed out the absence of any
legitimate expectation and the respondent's interests in maintaining and
immigration policy.

  16. The decision would have been strengthened had the judge specifically
      set out the position of the children. However, if the decision is read
      as a whole then the judge has had regard to the position of all
      members of the family. The judge had referred to having bundles from
      the appellant and the respondent which were taken into account. The
      judge at paragraph 15 made the point that the appellant and her
      husband are well educated and judge concluded the appellant would be
      able to find employment in Nigeria. The judge acknowledged there may
      be difficulties in starting again but the appellant has extended
      family who could be of assistance. The judge was not satisfied about
      the absence of medical treatment in Nigeria. Judge said at paragraph
      16 children were too young to have integrated into UK society. The
      judge went on to say it was in their best interest to return as a
      family unit. It can be taken from this that the judge has concluded it
      would not be unreasonable to expect the family particularly the
      children to return.

  17. The judge did not specifically refer to the public interest factors
      set out in section 117B but given that those factors on the facts
      stated would not assisted the appellant and the appeal was not allowed
      the failure would not have made any material difference. Consequently,
      I do not find a material error of law demonstrated

Decision.

No material error of law in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge PA
Grant Hutchison has been established. Consequently, that decision
dismissing the appeal shall stand.
