                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.    The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 12th  March  1979.  She
      appeals against the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  dated
      12th February 2014 dismissing her appeal under paragraph 284  and  301
      of the Immigration Rules, but  allowing  it  under  paragraph  EX1  of
      Appendix FM. On 22nd May 2014, the Respondent refused to vary leave to
      remain and made a decision to remove the Appellant, and her  dependant
      child, to Pakistan under section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
      Nationality Act 2006.

2.    Permission to appeal was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Taylor  on
      15th April 2014 on the grounds that it was  arguable  that  the  Judge
      erred in his calculations of the income available to the Appellant and
      in finding that she was unable to meet the maintenance requirements.

3.    In her Rule 24 response, the Respondent accepted that the Judge  ought
      to have taken into account working tax credit  and  child  tax  credit
      when calculating the amount of income (Ahmed [2013] UKUT  00084),  but
      opposed the appeal on  the  basis  that  the  Judge  directed  himself
      appropriately in any event.

4.    At the hearing, Mr Nath accepted that working  tax  credit  and  child
      tax credit should have been taken into account. There was a discussion
      as to the income available to the Appellant, after which  I  indicated
      that the Appellant  had  shown  that  she  satisfied  the  maintenance
      requirements, for the reasons set out below.

5.    The Judge concluded that the Appellant's husband earned  �2048.14  per
      month after tax. At the date of hearing, the Appellant's husband  also
      received working tax  credit  of  �359.52  and  child  tax  credit  of
      �459.79. The Judge found that these were public funds and could not be
      taken into account. The Judge also found that they had been calculated
      based on an annual income of �10,750 and the Appellant's husband would
      have earned �11,187.23 at the end of the tax year.

6.    I find that the Judge erred in law in finding  that  the  tax  credits
      were public funds. He also erred in finding that  he  could  not  take
      them into account because they were based on a  lower  annual  income.
      The Appellant's husband was entitled to those tax credits at the  date
      of hearing. The letter from the DWP stated that the amount of  working
      tax credit would be reduced to �223.77 and child tax credit  would  be
      increased to �461.02 in April 2014. The tax credits were  adjusted  to
      allow for the change in income.

7.    The monthly income therefore amounted  to  �2867.45.  The  Appellant's
      outgoings were �1298.87 per month and therefore the weekly  disposable
      income was �392.15. This exceeded the income support rate of �261.19.

8.    The Judge accepted that the income at the  date  of  hearing  exceeded
      the amount of income support, but found that it would not do so  after
      5th  April  2014  unless  the  Appellant's  husband  was   awarded   a
      substantial pay rise. In coming to this conclusion the Judge failed to
      take into account the tax credits, which even on the reduced  figures,
      resulted in a disposable income greater than income support.

9.    Accordingly, I find that the Judge  made  an  error  of  law  and  the
      decision dated 12th February 2014 is set aside. I remake the  decision
      and allow the appeal under paragraphs 284 and 301 of  the  Immigration
      Rules.
