Representation:

	For the Appellant:	Ms K Smith of Counsel instructed by Broudie Jackson & Canter

	For the Respondent:	Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

	

	

	DECISION AND REASONS

	

	1.	The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan who was born on 11th October 1985.  He made application to the respondent for recognition as a refugee and on 13th November 2017 the respondent refused to grant his claim.

	

	2.	The appellant subsequently appealed and his appeal was heard in Manchester on 2nd January 2018 by First-tier Tribunal Judge A J Parker.  

	

	3.	The judge accepted that the appellant worked for EMA in Afghanistan as a film producer and cameraman, but concluded that he would not be at risk were he to be returned to Afghanistan.  At the hearing before me today Mr McVeety told me that he and Counsel were in agreement. Given the judge’s findings, the judge has erred and should have allowed the appeal.  Mr McVeety asked me to formally allow the appeal which I am happy to do.  This determination appears as a matter of record.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD



As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is payable, I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable (adjusted where full award not justified) for the following reason.  The appeal is allowed.
