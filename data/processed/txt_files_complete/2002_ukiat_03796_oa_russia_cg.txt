                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a national of Russia,  has  appealed  with  leave  of  the
Tribunal  against  a  determination  of  Adjudicator,  Mrs   S   Brookfield,
dismissing  the  appeal  against  the  decision  by  the  respondent  giving
directions for removal following refusal to grant  asylum.  Mr  P  Jorro  of
Counsel instructed by A S Law Solicitors represented  the  appellant.  Mr  M
Davidson appeared for the respondent.


2. The Tribunal has decided to allow this appeal.

3. The adjudicator accepted that the appellant had a  well-founded  fear  of
persecution in Chechnya arising from  the  fact  that  he  was  a  pilot  of
civilian aircraft by profession who had refused to fly  planes  for  Chechen
rebels and that the authorities would  be  unable  to  protect  him  against
reprisals the rebels would take against  him  in  consequence.  However  she
considered the appellant had a viable internal flight alternative in  either
Rostov (where he had earlier sent his mother) or Ingushetia. In this  regard
she noted there was no evidence that Chechen rebels were looking for him  or
that they were able to infiltrate  Russia  to  seek  out  Chechens  who  had
refused  to  join  them  or  that  the  Russian  authorities   would   share
information about an individual's registration with Chechen rebels. Nor  was
there any evidence that he would be forcibly  repatriated  just  because  he
was an ethnic Russian from Chechnya. She pointed out that despite  being  an
ethnic Russian in Rostov who had failed to register, the appellant's  mother
had suffered no problems as a result. She discounted  his  claimed  fear  of
being persecuted because ordinary Russian would be alarmed by the fact  that
he was a pilot from Chechnya. As regards the situation  in  Ingushetia,  she
relied on the fact that there were so many Chechens there (170,000 had  fled
there after September 1999) that the  appellant  would  be  amongst  fellow-
Chechens and at no  risk  of  detection  by  any  Chechen  rebels.  However,
turning to the issue of whether in either  of  these  places  the  appellant
would be at risk of repeated arrests in roundups and would  be  singled  out
and beaten, she said:

      "The background reports indicate that security forces  do  single  out
      persons from the Caucasus for document checks, detention and extortion
      of bribes, though practice is not totally restricted to Chechens. I do
      find that the appellant  would  be  at  risk  of  being  subjected  to
      extortion in Russia."

4. She then went on to discount difficulties the  applicant  might  face  in
relation  to  judicial  process,  detention  in  dire   prison   conditions,
employment prospects, language discrimination and racial discrimination.  In
relation to accommodation difficulties, she  accepted  the  appellant  might
face real difficulties in  Ingushetia,  but  he  would  not  face  the  same
difficulties in Rostov.

5. Before proceeding to evaluate the particular  facts  of  this  appeal  we
would make four introductory observations, all of which arise  chiefly  from
the objective country  materials.  The  first  concerns  the  current  UNHCR
position which is reported in the CIPU Russian (Chechnya)  Bulletin  01/2002
as follows:

      "...the UNHCR is of the view that,  given  the  ongoing  unstable  and
      highly volatile situation in Chechnya and the  link  between  propiska
      registration and access to basic rights in the  rest  of  the  Russian
      Federation,  there  is  currently  no   viable   internal   relocation
      possibility that would guarantee effective protection to all of  those
      displaced by the Chechen conflict. It states that internal  relocation
      should therefore be considered  only  as  part  of  a  full  and  fair
      determination in each asylum claim".

6. Our second observation is that  the  adjudicator  was  plainly  wrong  to
conclude that racial discrimination in  not  a  part  of  everyday  life  in
Russia. That  finding  was  heavily  against  the  weight  of  the  evidence
including the CIPU Bulletin 01/2002 which refers to  Chechens  being  likely
to experience difficult living conditions and racial discrimination in  much
of Russia. The US State Department Report of February 2001 notes that:

      "Roma and persons from the Caucasus and Central Asia  face  widespread
      societal  discrimination,  which  often  is  reflected   in   official
      attitudes and actions. Police reportedly beat, harassed and  solicited
      bribes from persons with dark skin, or who appeared  to  be  from  the
      Caucasus, Central Asia, or Africa. Discrimination against persons from
      the Caucasus and Central Asia also  increased  concurrently  with  new
      measures at both the federal and local levels  to  combat  crime.  Law
      enforcement authorities targeted persons  with  dark  complexions  for
      harassment, arrest, and deportation from urban  centres,  particularly
      after the August 1999 bombing in Moscow. "


7.  A  third  observation,  closely  allied  to  the  second,  is  that  the
adjudicator`s findings on the  risk  of  extortion  were  clearly  based  on
background materials, in  particular  the  US  State  Department  report  of
February 2001 which states that:

      "There are credible reports that security forces  continue  to  single
      out persons from the  Caucasus  for  document  checks,  detention  and
      extortion of bribes."

8. Our final initial observation is that it is not in dispute  that  certain
areas of Russia are not places where an ethnic  Russian  from  Chechnya  can
live without facing  serious  difficulties  arising  from  being  unable  to
register there. These difficulties are well  documented  in  the  background
country reports. No doubt in the light of  these,  the  respondent  accepted
that in this case the only two realistic options open to the appellant  were
Ingushetia and Rostov.

9. As regards Ingushetia, we do not think  that  the  materials  before  the
adjudicator justified her in concluding that the appellant could live  there
without undue hardship. She noted very correctly that because  of  the  mass
influx of Chechens into that area, the most likely  available  accommodation
would be in makeshift camps. However, the adjudicator seemed to  think  that
although conditions in such camps would be harsh, they would not  be  unduly
so because the appellant had expressed himself ready to put  up  with  harsh
conditions. We consider that finding erroneous. In the  first  place  it  is
reasonable to infer  that,  if  the  appellant  were  returned  to  live  in
Ingushetia, he would be at  the  end  of  any  existing  Chechen  queue  for
accommodation. That is significant because in the CIPU Bulletin  01/2002  on
Russian Federation (Chechnya) dealing with Chechens outside Chechnya  it  is
stated  that  of  the  estimated  150,000  displaced  persons  remaining  in
Ingushetia one third were  accommodated  in  tented  camps  and  spontaneous
settlements and that those in camps had faced harsh weather and  a  shortage
of food and medicines that  has  caused  considerable  concern  among  human
rights organisations.

10. An earlier CIPU report stated that: "some 8,000 people are  believed  to
be living  in  railway  carriages  in  the  region,  many  of  them  without
sufficient heating and appropriate sanitation facilities,  which  puts  them
at risk of contagious diseases....".

11. In the second place, we do not think the appellant's own statement  that
he could tolerate harsh conditions should properly have been  taken  by  the
adjudicator as meaning that conditions would not be  unduly  harsh  in  this
case. Certainly in  assessing  hardship  it  is  relevant  to  consider  the
physical and mental health of the individual in relation to such factors  as
age, health and the like. However, there is obviously a minimum standard  of
subsistence below which no one can be expected to exist.  In  Ingushetia  we
also think the appellant would also face additional  difficulties  of  being
perceived as of mixed ethnic origin and mixed religious background. In  this
regard we cannot agree with the adjudicator  who  appeared  to  forget  this
factor in finding that the appellant would in that area be  amongst  "fellow
Chechens".

12.  Thus the only real internal relocation option open  to  this  appellant
was Rostov. Even assuming the adjudicator was  right  to  entirely  discount
any continuing risk of the appellant being  pursued  in  Rostov  by  Chechen
rebels, we do not think she was justified in concluding that  the  appellant
would not face very considerable difficulties in living there.  On  her  own
findings - findings we  consider  sustainable  -   the  appellant  would  be
subject to a real risk of extortion. Furthermore,  as  regards  difficulties
with registration in Rostov, it may be that this city is note  mentioned  in
the background materials as one where registration difficulties  are  acute,
but we do not think the adjudicator was  justified  in  assuming  that  just
because  the  appellant's  mother  had  not  had   difficulties   with   the
registration system, he would not. As Mr Jorro pointed out, the  appellant's
mother is a pure ethnic Russian as well as an older person. Given  that  the
propiska system is evidently operated quite  rigorously  throughout  Russia,
we  do  not  think  it  justifiable  to  conclude   that   the   appellant's
difficulties in this regard would be any less than those facing  others  who
were visibly Chechen in origin.  As  regards  accommodation,  there  was  no
evidence he could live with his mother as she was living with a  friend,  so
that would cause  some  extra,  even  if  not  insuperable,  difficulty.  In
addition he would, as already  noted,  face  a  certain  level  of  societal
discrimination affecting the areas of employment in particular:  the  latest
April 2002 Country Assessment on Russia noted that people from the  Caucasus
and Central Asia  continue  to  face  "widespread  societal  discrimination,
which is often reflected in official attitudes and actions". In short he  in
common  with  others  displaced  from  Chechnya  would   face   considerable
difficulties in relocating in Rostov.

13. We doubt that these common difficulties  on  their  own  would  make  it
unduly harsh for him to relocate there. However, in assessing the  issue  of
undue hardship  it  is  obviously  essential  to  consider  the  appellant`s
individual circumstances as well as those he  would  share  in  common  with
other Chechens. To some extent these do not point in the direction of  undue
hardship: the appellant is a relatively young man  in  good  health  who  in
Rostov would have some family contact. But in addition  to  the  common  and
quite considerable difficulties  already  identified,  there  would  be  two
specific  difficulties  facing  this  appellant.   One   we   have   already
highlighted, namely his mixed ethnic origin. In our view this would at  once
deny him full acceptance by fellow-Chechen also displaced and on  the  other
hand make him just as liable as them to  widespread  societal  and  official
discrimination. The  other  is  something  which  the  adjudicator  entirely
discounted. It relates to  the  fact  that  he  is  a  civilian  pilot.  She
discounted this on the basis that there was no reason why anyone  in  Russia
(outside Chechnya) should come to learn of  it.  However  we  think  this  a
somewhat  facile  conclusion.  Russians  have  suffered  terrorist   attacks
launched against  them  by  Chechen  rebels.  Security  concerns  have  been
widespread. Plainly in the course of different types  of  contact  with  the
authorities, authorities whom we already know are apt  to  try  and  exploit
Chechens and other ethnic minorities, the appellant  would  be  required  to
state his background.  Particularly  in  the  wake  of  the  strong  Russian
reaction to the events of September 11th, it would be na�ve in our  view  to
entirely discount the real  likelihood  that  this  would  create  an  added
ground for suspicion, in-depth scrutiny and harassment  of  this  appellant,
since, in the eyes of Russian officials, he could well  be  perceived  as  a
Chechen rebel harbouring  malice  aforethought.  No  doubt,  after  he  made
protestations, they would recognise he was in fact opposed  to  the  Chechen
rebels, but the likely experience of having frequently to  rebut  suspicions
plainly adds a real dimension to the level of difficulties he would face  in
Rostov (and indeed elsewhere in Russia).

14. For the  above  reasons  we  agree  with  Mr  Jorro  that,  viewing  the
difficulties this appellant would face in having to relocate  within  Russia
cumulatively, there  was  sufficient  evidence  before  the  adjudicator  to
demonstrate that it would be unduly harsh for him to have to relocate.

15. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
