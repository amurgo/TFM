Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms. J. Rothwell, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Ms A. Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 30 September 1979.

 2. She made application for leave to remain on human rights grounds.  That
    application was refused by the respondent on 12 August 2014 as she  was
    not satisfied that the appellant had been in  the  United  Kingdom  for
    twenty years or had a child or partner in the country,  nor  was  there
    evidence to prove she had been in the United  Kingdom  before  2007  or
    that there would be significant obstacles  to  her  reintegration  into
    Nigeria where she would appear to have spent most of her life.  No high
    level of dependency with family members in the United Kingdom had  been
    proven and she had no expectation of being allowed to  stay.   Suitable
    medical treatment was available in Nigeria, her condition is not  life-
    threatening and the medical documents indicated she  does  not  have  a
    suicidal ideation.

 3. The appellant  appealed  that  decision  and  following  a  hearing  at
    Richmond and in a decision promulgated on 11  May  2015  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal A J M Baldwin dismissed the appellant's appeal both
    under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 4. The appellant's immigration history is one of having claimed  to  enter
    the United Kingdom on 6 February 1996 and applying for indefinite leave
    to remain on 7 June 2011 based on long residency, a claim refused  with
    no right of appeal.  A request for reconsideration of that decision was
    refused in April 2012.  She was subsequently interviewed on 9  December
    2013 and served with an IS.151A "illegal entry verbal deception".

 5. The appellant's claim is based upon her dependency on  her  mother  and
    family members in the United Kingdom due to her paranoid  schizophrenia
    and type 2 diabetes.  In Nigeria she would face degrading and  inhumane
    treatment, having no- one there to whom she could turn for the level of
    support she requires.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal considered  the  appellant's  bundle  including
    witness statements, interview records, supportive letters  and  medical
    evidence.  That evidence is recorded at  paragraphs  9  to  14  of  the
    judge's decision.

 7. The judge's findings are recorded at paragraphs 22  onward.   He  found
    amongst other things, that  the  appellant  continues  to  suffer  from
    paranoid schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes and that her  psychiatrist's
    view is that the support she receives  from  her  mother  is  vital  to
    maintaining stability and deportation  presents  a  real  risk  of  her
    suffering a relapse, resulting in risk to herself and others.   Further
    that the psychiatric evidence shows that she has  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom since at least 2007.  The psychiatrist does though not  address
    the issue of whether it is possible that a patient in  their  late  20s
    might suddenly become a paranoid schizophrenic with no previous medical
    history or evidence of substance abuse.  The judge went on to  consider
    medical evidence and records showing that the  appellant  had  been  in
    employment through a London care agency between 1996 and 2004  and  her
    enjoying this work but which both "the appellant and her mother  insist
    she did not undertake".  The judge considered this  issue  and  made  a
    finding that  in  the  absence  of  any  documentary  or  corroborative
    evidence in relation to her employment the  most  probable  explanation
    for the inconsistent evidence would appear to  be  that  the  appellant
    and/or her mother mentioned  the  appellant's  working  in  the  United
    Kingdom for many years in the hope that it might eventually  advance  a
    case for her to be allowed to remain.

 8. The judge found at paragraph 25 of his decision  that  the  appellant's
    mother's "word cannot safely be relied upon".  During  the  hearing  he
    recorded that her evidence shifted when questions were put to her about
    her passport and her last visit to Nigeria.  She clearly told the judge
    that she did not have a passport with her and that she  had  last  been
    back to her  country  of  origin  ten  years  ago.   This  evidence  is
    materially inconsistent with the evidence she gave some  moments  later
    to the judge when she provided her passport and it  became  clear  that
    she went back three and a half years ago  to  attend  a  wedding.   The
    judge went on to find this evidence suggestive of other family  members
    still being in Nigeria.  He then went on to make findings  in  relation
    to the evidence of both the appellant and her mother as to  whether  or
    not the appellant's father died in 2005 or five to six  years  ago  and
    noted that there was no  corroborative  documentary  evidence  of  this
    death at all.

 9. The judge found that the appellant may have registered  with  a  GP  in
    1996 when entering the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor.   There  was  no
    documentary evidence of her  working  (payslips  etc.)  in  the  United
    Kingdom between 1996 and 2004.  He concluded that it was more  probable
    than not that the appellant returned to Nigeria after such a  visit  in
    1996 and came back around 2007 when she began suffering from mental ill-
    health.  The judge took  account  of  letters  within  the  appellant's
    bundle in relation to the appellant's presence in  the  United  Kingdom
    but noted that none of those letter-writers had  been  called  to  give
    evidence and found therefore that he was "unable to attach much  weight
    to what they said about this".  The judge  also  took  account  of  the
    evidence of a church minister which was of a more restrictive nature in
    terms of how long he had known the appellant and/or her family.

10. The judge summarised his findings at paragraph 27 of his decision which
    states:-

         "In summary, the Appellant is 35 years old, not in  a  relationship
         and has no children.  She  has  proved  she  has  been  in  the  UK
         continuously since 2007 and I accept she may have  visited  the  UK
         back in 1996.  She suffers  from  two  serious  medical  conditions
         which require her to take medications orally and by injection.  She
         has not proved that her father is dead, and if he died in 2005  (or
         5-6 years ago) it would seem  very  odd  that  no  reference  would
         appear to him being deceased in the Affidavit the Appellant made on
         14.9.10.  Having first applied for  ILR  based  on  Long  Residence
         almost 4 years ago she has, with her mother's help, had  more  than
         enough time  to  locate  evidence  about  her  father  and  provide
         evidence relating to the years between 1996 and 2007.  Her  failure
         to adduce evidence to which I could attach any  significant  weight
         is notable and, I find, significant.  She has never had leave to be
         in the UK and her status has therefore been precarious throughout."

11. The judge concluded his findings at paragraph 28 of his decision  which
    states:-

         "The Appellant's conditions are serious and I accept that a failure
         to treat them would present risk to herself and to  others  whether
         she is in the UK or in Nigeria.  No evidence has been  provided  by
         or on behalf of the Appellant to show that  her  medications  would
         not be available in Nigeria or that they would be unaffordable  for
         the mother who has accepted financial responsibility for her.   The
         mother works as a Nurse and would,  according  to  the  latest  Pay
         Slips she has provided - (September 2013) - appear to be capable of
         earning nearly �40k. p.a., her gross pay to Month  6  of  2013-2014
         being c.�19.3k.  As the mother visited Nigeria just 3.5  years  ago
         for a Wedding, it would seem likely she still has family there, and
         there is no documentary evidence that  the  Appellant's  father  is
         dead.  It is clear from the Church Minister's letter that,  despite
         the Appellant's medical conditions, she is able to  make  a  useful
         contribution to her Church and there is no evidence to suggest  she
         will not be able to do so in Nigeria,  where  her  Church  will  no
         doubt do what it can to support her and encourage her.  There being
         no reliable evidence to show that her father is dead, I  find  that
         it is reasonable to suppose that he is still  alive  and  would  be
         prepared to assist his daughter to some  degree.   The  Appellant's
         condition is not such that it cannot be treated,  though  I  accept
         that she may need encouragement and possibly  reminding  to  follow
         it.  She would be returning to a country in which it is more likely
         than not she spent the first 26-27 years  of  her  life,  much  the
         greater part of her life.  She has never been  entitled  to  expect
         that she would be allowed to  remain  in  the  UK.   The  objective
         evidence in  the  Refusal  Letter  concerning  Healthcare  and  the
         availability of medications in Nigeria has not been  challenged  by
         the production of any objective evidence by the  Appellant.   There
         is no evidence to suggest that there is a real risk  the  Appellant
         would attempt suicide were she to be  removed  and  I  accept  that
         medications for her treatment are available  in  Nigeria.   On  the
         evidence  presented,  removal  would  be   neither   inhumane   nor
         degrading.  I do not doubt that medical treatment in Nigeria may be
         less good and more expensive then it would be were the Appellant to
         be allowed to remain in the UK, but that is not  sufficient  reason
         to allow the Appellant to remain.  The  Appellant  is  recorded  as
         having 'good  insight',  recognising  the  'early  warning  signs',
         complying with her medications and engaging with medical  services.
         These are all important but might count for little if she genuinely
         had no-one to whom she  could  turn  in  Nigeria  for  support  and
         encouragement.  An absence  of  family  in  Nigeria  she  has  not,
         however, proved and I find for the reasons set out above that it is
         more probable than not that her father  and  other  family  members
         remain in Nigeria.  I accept that the Appellant's mother and  step-
         father will worry about her if she has to return but the  Appellant
         is an adult and one can be confident that the mother will  continue
         to support her financially and made  arrangements  in  Nigeria  for
         such support and care as the Appellant may need.  As a  Nurse,  and
         one who lived for many years in  Nigeria  and  has  quite  recently
         visited the country, the mother should be well-equipped to  arrange
         this, travelling to Nigeria to do so should that be necessary.  Her
         income suggests this should not cause her  undue  difficulty.   The
         Appellant's removal would, I find, be neither disproportionate  nor
         unreasonable  to  any  of  them  and  her  circumstances  are   not
         exceptional."

12. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  sought  but  initially
    refused.  A renewed application was granted by  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Archer on 10 September 2015.  His reasons for granting permission
    were as follows:-

         "The  grounds  of  appeal  seek  to  challenge  the  findings   and
         conclusions  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Baldwin.    However,
         permission to appeal can only be granted if  there  is  a  properly
         argued point of law capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal.

         The grounds assert that the  judge  erred  in  law  by  basing  the
         findings about length of stay in the  UK  on  speculation  and  not
         evidence, failed to give an opportunity for expert evidence  as  to
         when paranoid schizophrenia can  develop  (then  finding  that  the
         appellant entered the UK in  2007  after  her  illness  developed),
         speculated that the appellant's father is alive and can look  after
         her (the evidence was that the father is  dead)  and  made  similar
         speculative findings about the ability of the mother to look  after
         the  appellant  in  Nigeria.   Long  residence  should  have   been
         considered under the pre-2012 Immigration Rules.

         I find that the grounds are arguable.  The  judge  found  that  the
         appellant has serious  symptoms  and  has  suffered  from  paranoid
         schizophrenia since 2007.  Fact finding required the utmost care."

13. Ms  Rothwell  argued  that  the  judge  first  erred  in  relying  upon
    speculation for coming to the conclusion that  the  appellant  had  not
    been in the United Kingdom since 1996 and that great care ought to have
    been taken prior to coming to the conclusion that he did.  She referred
    me to various elements of the medical evidence  where  it  is  recorded
    that the appellant had been referred to as working.   She  crystallised
    this aspect of her appeal by concluding that the conflict between  that
    evidence and the judge's findings was enough to cast  sufficient  doubt
    on the evidence thereby rendering it unsafe.  Secondly  that  this  was
    not an issue referred to in the respondent's refusal letter and that if
    the judge was concerned  about  it,  given  that  it  went  to  adverse
    credibility findings, he ought to have adjourned the hearing part heard
    for psychiatric evidence  to  be  obtained  from  the  psychiatrist  to
    comment on the issues.  Thirdly the judge further speculated  that  the
    appellant's father would look after her in Nigeria and particularly  so
    in his finding that:-

         "There is no reliable evidence to show that her father is  dead,  I
         find that it is reasonable to suppose that he is  still  alive  and
         would be prepared to assist his daughter to some degree."

    I was referred to evidence that the appellant's  father  organised  her
    travel to the United Kingdom  without  reference  to  her  mother.   Ms
    Rothwell accepted there was no corroborative evidence of  her  father's
    death but argued that it was "a quantum leap" to find that he would  be
    able to look after the appellant in her country of origin.   There  was
    no evidence that he would be able to do this  and  such  a  speculative
    finding amounted to a material error of law.  It was accepted that  the
    appellant's witness statement did not  deal  with  this  issue  nor  an
    affidavit she swore in 2010 which appears at paragraph 96 of her bundle
    which sets out her circumstances but fails to record the death  of  her
    father.  Fourthly the judge again erred in  his  consideration  of  the
    appellant's mother's financial position relying on payslips within  her
    bundle that are dated between 2010 and  2011.   She  suggested  it  was
    incumbent upon the judge to enquire about the position as  at  2015  at
    the time of hearing.  Finally it was argued the judge failed to  assess
    the evidence of the appellant's supporters  who  had  provided  letters
    within her bundle regarding both her and her family and the  length  of
    time she had been in the United  Kingdom.   It  was  argued  the  judge
    failed to state how much weight he had applied to such evidence.

14. Finally Ms Rothwell accepted that if she was unable to succeed  on  the
    abovementioned arguments the balance of her grounds seeking  permission
    to appeal fell away.  They relate to an argument that her  claim  ought
    to have been considered under paragraph 276 of the Immigration Rules HC
    395 (as amended) and not under Appendix FM.

15. Opposing the appeal Ms Everett urged me to accept that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had directed himself appropriately and that the  grounds
    seeking permission to appeal were no more than a disagreement with  the
    judge's findings that were open to be made on  the  evidence  that  was
    before him.

16. For the following reasons I share that analysis.

17. In so doing I recognise, as did Ms Rothwell, that consideration of  her
    "Robinson" obvious argument becomes a redundant exercise.

18. The judge has considered the totality of the evidence that  was  before
    him.  It was always for the appellant to prove her case to the required
    standard and in so doing the burden of providing evidence  rested  upon
    her.  Throughout she has been legally represented.  The judge has  come
    to conclusions that were fully open to be made on the evidence.   There
    was ample justification for his adverse credibility findings and he has
    provided legally adequate reasoning for coming to the conclusions  that
    he did in relation  to  the  appellant's  claim.   I  accept  that  the
    appellant's grounds seeking permission to appeal amount to no more than
    a disagreement with findings and reasoning which are  legally  adequate
    and  taken  proper  account  of  the  totality  of  the  evidence  both
    documentary and oral that fell to be considered by Judge Baldwin.

19. The judge considered the totality of the psychiatric evidence and there
    was  nothing  speculative  about  his  findings  in  relation  to   the
    conclusion that the appellant had not been in the United Kingdom  since
    1996.  Contrary to the asserted grounds the judge has taken great  care
    and this is a detailed and carefully  written  decision  analysing  all
    aspects of the appellant's appeal.  The judge has  made  findings  that
    were open to him in coming to the conclusions as to  how  the  evidence
    panned out and a  realisation  that  there  was  a  "complete  lack  of
    documentary corroboration"  in  relation  to  the  appellant's  claimed
    working in the United Kingdom.  The  judge  was  entitled  to  find  at
    paragraph 25 of his decision that  the  appellant's  mother's  evidence
    could not be relied on.  Contrary to the asserted grounds there  is  no
    speculation in relation to whether a patient in her late twenties might
    suddenly become a paranoid schizophrenic.  The judge  makes  a  finding
    that the expert evidence did not address this issue and no more.   Even
    if this were an exercise in speculation, as is asserted, it  would  not
    have been material  to  the  outcome  of  this  particular  appellant's
    appeal.  Again in relation  to  the  appellant's  father's  "death"  it
    cannot be said that the judge has  relied  upon  speculation.   He  has
    considered the evidence that was put before him including not only oral
    evidence but also the witness statements of the appellant,  her  mother
    and stepfather alongside other materials including an  affidavit  sworn
    by the appellant in 2010.  The appellant had ample opportunity  to  put
    forward a case that relied upon her father's death but failed to do so.
     Likewise the judge's conclusions were informed by the evidence of  the
    appellant's mother which became apparent  as  the  hearing  went  along
    after consideration of her passport showed that she had  returned  some
    three and a half years ago to Nigeria to attend a wedding.   Of  course
    the judge took account of the appellant's mother's payslips.  They were
    provided to him within the appellant's bundle and it  is  difficult  to
    conclude that they should  have  been  set  aside  and  other  evidence
    considered which fell to be  provided  by  the  appellant  through  her
    representatives.  The judge attaches little weight to the  evidence  of
    the appellant's friends who put forward letters which  are  within  the
    appellant's bundle but who did not attend  the  hearing  to  give  oral
    evidence.  He says at paragraph 26 of his decision:-

         "I therefore find myself unable to attach much weight to what  they
         say about this."

    He also notes that the church minister did not indicate from what  year
    he had known the appellant limiting himself  to  stating  that  he  had
    known her parents and their family for over ten years.  It is difficult
    to appreciate how else the judge was to express his  analysis  of  this
    evidence.  In the absence of  oral  evidence  little  weight  could  be
    attached to it.  That was the approach of the judge and in taking it he
    has not, as Ms Rothwell, suggests materially erred.

20. As I say I find the grounds put forward by  the  appellant  essentially
    amount to no more than  an  argument  with  the  conclusions  of  Judge
    Baldwin.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
