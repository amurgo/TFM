                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.   Article 1F of the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of  Refugees
    1951 and New York Protocol 1967 provides that the  provisions  of  that
    Convention shall not apply in three specified  sets  of  circumstances.
    The effect of Article 1F is  that  a  person  who  would  otherwise  be
    recognised as a refugee  under  the  Convention,  with  all  that  that
    entails, must not be given that recognition if he or she  falls  within
    one or more of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article 1F.

2.   Our task in the present case is  to  determine  whether  the  appellant
    falls to be excluded by reason of Article 1F(c).  This entails making a
    finding as to whether there are serious reasons  for  considering  that
    the appellant "has been guilty of acts contrary  to  the  purposes  and
    principles of the United Nations". As we shall describe in more detail,
    the Court of Appeal ([2010] EWCA Civ  1407)  remitted  the  appellant's
    appeal to the Tribunal for it to perform that  task;  and  the  Supreme
    Court agreed (Al Sirri v Secretary of State for the Home Department; DD
    (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012]  UKSC
    54.

3.     We should, however, make it plain that, irrespective of  our  finding
    on this issue, there is no current  prospect  of  the  appellant  being
    removed from the United Kingdom to  Afghanistan,  the  country  of  his
    nationality.  In 2008, Immigration Judge E M Simpson  found  that  such
    removal would be reasonably likely to violate  the  appellant's  rights
    under Article 3 of the ECHR, whereby no  one  is  to  be  subjected  to
    torture or to inhuman or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment.   Being
    recognised as a refugee under the  1951  Convention,  however,  carries
    various benefits, both under the Convention itself and by reason of the
    operation of various policies of the  respondent.   These  include  the
    ability to have certain family members join the refugee in  the  United
    Kingdom, even though this would entail  additional  burdens  on  public
    funds.  In addition, a  refugee  is  accorded  a  significantly  longer
    period of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, compared with
    a person to whom Article 1F applies.

The Supreme Court's description of the facts of the appellant's case

4.   At this stage, it is  convenient  to  set  out  [41]  to  [46]  of  the
    judgment of Lady Hale and Lord Dyson in Al-Sirri and DD (with whom Lord
    Phillips, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson agreed).  Though there  appears  to
    have been no issue before the Supreme Court that  these  were,  indeed,
    the salient facts of the appellant's case, the  appellant  has,  as  we
    shall see, sought to resile from them:-

         "[41]    The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan.  He arrived  in
             the United Kingdom on 18 January 2007 and applied  for  asylum
             on the same day.  The basis of his claim was  that  he  feared
             persecution because of his association with  his  brother  AD,
             who was a well known Jamiat-e-Islami commander in Afghanistan.
              Following the fall of the Najibullah government in 1992,  the
             appellant's brother became responsible for other commanders in
             the north of Afghanistan and  formed  a  number  of  strategic
             alliances, ultimately allying himself with the  Taliban.   The
             appellant acted as his deputy and commanded between 50 and 300
             men.  He was later demoted and reduced to the  command  of  no
             more than 20 men.


         [42]  Following  US  military  intervention  in  Afghanistan,   the
             appellant and his brother fled  to  Pakistan.   In  2004,  the
             appellant's  brother  was  assassinated  in  Pakistan  by  his
             enemies  who  held  positions  in  the  Karzai  government  of
             Afghanistan.   The  appellant  was  also  a  target   of   the
             assassination attempt and sustained gunshot  injuries.   After
             about  a  month,  he  returned  to  Afghanistan   and   sought
             protection from his enemies by joining  a  military  grouping,
             Hizb-e-Islami.  He commanded 10-15 people and engaged in  both
             offensive and defensive military operations against  both  the
             Afghan government and the forces of ISAF.


         [43] The appellant's nephew (the son of his deceased  brother)  was
             killed in Peshawar in about September 2006.  The appellant was
             ordered to fight in his home area.  He decided that  it  would
             be too dangerous for him to do so as he had enemies there  who
             were high ranking members of the Karzai government.   He  fled
             once again to Pakistan and arrangements were made  through  an
             agent for him to travel from there to the United Kingdom.   He
             claimed asylum saying that he feared that, if he were returned
             to Afghanistan, he would be killed by his  deceased  brother's
             enemies or by Hizb-e-Islami as a traitor.


         [44] By letter dated 27 April 2007, the Secretary of State  refused
             the claim on the grounds that the appellant's account was  not
             credible.  In particular, he did not accept the  account  that
             he gave of his role  in  Hizb-e-Islami.   By  letter  dated  6
             August 2007, the Secretary of State gave supplementary reasons
             for the refusal.  These were that,  even  if  the  appellant's
             claimed activities in Afghanistan were substantiated,  he  was
             not entitled to asylum in any event.   This  was  because  his
             claim that he had fought against ISAF, if accepted, meant that
             he had been guilty  of  acts  contrary  to  the  purposes  and
             principles of the United Nations and  was  therefore  excluded
             from the definition of refugee by reason of article  1F(c)  of
             the Refugee Convention.


         [45] The appellant appealed to the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal
             ('AIT').  IJ Morgan found the appellant  to  be  credible  and
             allowed his appeal under  the  Refugee  Convention  and  under
             Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR').
              He had a well-founded fear of persecution  by  his  brother's
             enemies some of whom were members of  the  Karzai  government.
             The judge was not persuaded that the appellant had been guilty
             of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the  United
             Nations.  For reasons  that  are  immaterial  to  the  present
             appeal, a second stage  reconsideration  was  ordered  by  SIJ
             Moulden.


         [46] The second stage reconsideration was conducted by  IJ  Simpson
             who, by a determination promulgated on 28 August 2008, allowed
             the appellant's appeal on both asylum and  Article  3  of  the
             ECHR grounds.  The judge found the appellant to  be  credible,
             except that she rejected his assertion that his  actions  with
             Hizb-e-Islami  in  Afghanistan  were  defensive.   He  had   a
             longstanding history of military involvement  in  Afghanistan,
             'including at a high level, deputy to his  Commander  brother,
             and independently a Commander in Hizb-e-Islami  Hekmatayar  in
             Kunar'.  There were prima facie grounds  for  considering  his
             actions were both offensive and defensive.  As regards article
             1F(c), the judge concluded that section 54  of  the  2006  Act
             (see para 7 above), which came into effect on 31 August  2006,
             appeared to have effected a substantive change in the law  and
             that, as a matter of natural justice, it applied only to  acts
             after it came into force, that is from September 2006[1].  She
             concluded at para 151:


                  'Having regard to the  combined  lack  of  specificity  of
                  evidence of the appellant's conduct with Hizb-e-Islami and
                  the highly reasonable likelihood,  given  the  chronology,
                  that his involvement with Hizb-e-Islami  was  at  its  end
                  stage after September 2006 and the coming into  effect  of
                  section 54, I find in sum there are  not  serious  grounds
                  for considering he committed  a  barred  act(s).   I  find
                  article 1F(c) does not apply.'"

The issues in the Court of Appeal

5.   In its judgments, the Court of Appeal ([2010] EWCA Civ 1407) held  that
    section 54 of the 2006 Act was, in  law,  capable  of  covering  events
    prior to the date on which it came into effect; but, on the findings of
    Judge Simpson, the appellant had not, in fact, committed  any  acts  of
    terrorism within the meaning of that section.  The Court held that  the
    issue of whether the appellant fell to be excluded under the Convention
    by reason of Article 1F(c) nevertheless remained.  In its judgment:-

         "The UN Security Council has mandated forces to conduct  operations
         in Afghanistan.  The force  is  mandated  to  assist  and  maintain
         security and to protect and support the UN's work in Afghanistan so
         that its  personnel  engaged  in  reconstruction  and  humanitarian
         efforts can operate  in  a  secure  environment.   Direct  military
         action against forces carrying out that mandate is  in  my  opinion
         action contrary to  the  purposes  and  principles  of  the  United
         Nations and attracts the exemption provided by  (article  1F(c)  of
         the Convention [64] (Pill LJ)."

6.   The Court accordingly remitted the  case  for  reconsideration  by  the
    Upper Tribunal, since the judge had failed to consider the  appellant's
    individual responsibility, as required by JS (Sri Lanka) [2010] UKSC 15
    and by the Court of Justice of the  European  Union  in  Bundesrepublik
    Deutschland v B and D [2011] Imm AR 190; and whether the appellant  had
    been guilty of acts contrary to the  purposes  and  principles  of  the
    United Nations.  That remains our task ([76] of Al-Sirri and DD).



The appellant's case in the Supreme Court

7.   Before the Supreme  Court,  the  appellant's  stance  was  that  direct
    military action against the ISAF forces in Afghanistan could not, as  a
    matter of law, constitute behaviour falling within Article 1F(c).   The
    Supreme Court found against the appellant on that issue, concluding  as
    follows:-

         "[68]    In short, an attack on ISAF is  in  principle  capable  of
             being an act contrary to the purposes and  principles  of  the
             United Nations.  The fundamental aims and objectives  of  ISAF
             accord with the first purpose  stated  in  article  1  of  the
             United Nations Charter.  By attacking ISAF, the appellant  was
             seeking to frustrate that purpose.  To hold that his acts  are
             in principle capable of being acts contrary  to  the  purposes
             and principles of the United Nations accords with common sense
             and is correct in law.  This conclusion accords with  that  of
             Hogan J in the High Court of Ireland in B  v  Refugee  Appeals
             Tribunal and others [2011] IEHC 198 at  para  56.   For  these
             reasons, we agree with the conclusion of the Court of  Appeal,
             quoted in para 47 above."

8.   The Supreme Court also made findings on the autonomous meaning  of  the
    words "serious reasons for  considering"  in  Article  1F.   The  Court
    agreed with the UNHCR view "...  that  the  exclusion  clauses  in  the
    Refugee Convention must be  restrictively  interpreted  and  cautiously
    applied.  This leads us to draw the following conclusions:

         (1)  'Serious reasons' is stronger than 'reasonable grounds'.


         (2)  The evidence from which those  reasons  are  derived  must  be
             'clear and credible' or 'strong'.


         (3)  'Considering is stronger than 'suspecting'.  In our view it is
             also stronger than 'believing'.  It  requires  the  considered
             judgment of the decision-maker.


         (4)  The decision-maker need not  be  satisfied  beyond  reasonable
             doubt or to the standard required in criminal law.


         (5)  It is unnecessary to import our domestic  standards  of  proof
             into the question.  The circumstances of refugee  claims,  and
             the  nature  of  the  evidence  available,  are  so  variable.
             However, if the decision-maker is satisfied that  it  is  more
             likely than not that the application  has  not  committed  the
             crimes in question or has not been guilty of acts contrary  to
             the purposes and principles  of  the  United  Nations,  it  is
             difficult to see  how  there  could  be  serious  reasons  for
             considering that he had done so.  The reality  is  that  there
             are  unlikely  to  be   sufficiently   serious   reasons   for
             considering the applicant to be guilty  unless  the  decision-
             maker can be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he
             is.  But the task of the decision-maker is to apply the  words
             of the Convention (and the Directive) in the particular case."
             [75]

9.    Before turning to the evidence, it is necessary to  consider  in  more
    detail what is required by the case law when making an "individualised"
    assessment or consideration of the facts of a particular case.

KJ (Sri Lanka) [2009] EWCA Civ 292

10.  In KJ (Sri Lanka) the issue was whether KJ's membership of the LTTE  in
    Sri Lanka brought him within the exclusion  in  Article  1F(c)  of  the
    Convention.  The judgment of the Court was given by Stanley Burnton LJ:-



         "35.     I turn ... to consider what must be shown in  relation  to
             the person in relation to whom a question of  the  application
             of the exclusion clause arises.  Certain points are, I  think,
             clear.  First, the Convention may  be  excluded  even  if  the
             evidence available does  not  establish  positively  that  the
             person in question committed a crime against peace or  one  of
             the other crimes or acts identified in paragraphs (a), (b)  or
             (c): it is  sufficient  if  there  are  'serious  reasons  for
             considering' that he did so.  Nonetheless, the crimes and acts
             referred to are  all  serious,  and  the  seriousness  of  the
             reasons must correspond with the seriousness of the crimes and
             acts in question.  Secondly, each of the  paragraphs  requires
             the personal guilt of the person in question:  paragraphs  (a)
             and (b) refer to his having committed a crime  of  the  nature
             described, and paragraph (c) refers to  his  having  committed
             acts contrary to the purposes and  principles  of  the  United
             Nations.  It follows that mere membership of  an  organisation
             that, among other  activities,  commits  such  acts  does  not
             suffice to bring the exclusion into play.  On the other  hand,
             in my judgment a person  who  knowingly  participates  in  the
             planning or financing of  a  specified  crime  or  act  or  is
             otherwise a party to it, as  a  conspirator  or  an  aider  or
             abettor, is as much guilty of that crime or act as the  person
             who carries out the final deed.


         36.  Lastly, so far as paragraph (c) is  concerned,  it  is  common
             ground that acts of terrorism, such as the deliberate  killing
             of civilians, are contrary to the purposes and  principles  of
             the UN.


         37.  The application of Article 1F(c) will  be  straightforward  in
             the case of an active member of organisation that promotes its
             objects  only  by  acts  of  terrorism.   There  will   almost
             certainly be serious reasons for considering that he has  been
             guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of  the
             United Nations.


         38.  However, the LTTE, during the period when KJ was a member, was
             not such an organisation.  It pursued its  political  ends  in
             part by acts of terrorism  and  in  part  by  military  action
             directed against the armed forces of  the  government  of  Sri
             Lanka.    The   application   of   Article   1F(c)   is   less
             straightforward in such a case.  A person  may  join  such  an
             organisation, because he agrees with its political objectives,
             and by willing to participate in its military actions, but may
             not agree with and may not be willing to  participate  in  its
             terrorist  activities.   Of  course,  the  higher  up  in  the
             organisation a person is the more likely will be the inference
             that he agrees  with  and  promotes  all  of  its  activities,
             including its terrorism.  But it  seems  to  me  that  a  foot
             soldier in such an organisation, who has not  participated  in
             acts of terrorism, and in particular has not  participated  in
             the murder or attempted murder  of  civilians,  has  not  been
             guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of  the
             United Nations."



JS (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] UKSC 15

11.  Stanley Burnton LJ's analysis in  KJ  found  favour  with  the  Supreme
    Court in JS .  In JS the Court was concerned with  potential  exclusion
    under Article 1F(a) of the  Convention,  in  a  case  which,  like  KJ,
    involved membership of  the  LTTE.   The  Supreme  Court  examined  the
    wording of Article 1F, along with parallel wording  in  Article  12  of
    Council Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the  Qualification  Directive").   The
    Court considered that, in determining whether a person was excluded  by
    Article 1F(a) for being complicit  in  war  crimes  or  crimes  against
    humanity because of his membership of a  particular  organisation,  the
    starting point was now the Rome Statute of the  International  Criminal
    Court.

12.  At [35] of the judgments, Lord Brown  held  that  it  "must  surely  be
    correct to say ... that  Article  1F  disqualifies  those  who  make  a
    'substantial contribution to' the crime, knowing  that  their  acts  or
    omissions will facilitate it", as well as "anyone contributing  to  the
    commission of such crimes 'by substantially assisting the  organisation
    to continue to function effectively in pursuance  of  its  aims'".   At
    [36] Lord Brown held:-

         "36. Of course, criminal responsibility would only attach to  those
             with the necessary mens rea (mental element).  But, as article
             30 of the ICC Statute makes plain, if a person is  aware  that
             in the ordinary course of events a particular consequence will
             follow from his actions, he is taken to have acted  with  both
             knowledge and intent.  (I would for  this  reason  reject  the
             claimant's criticism of the  omission  from  para  21  of  the
             German court's judgment of any separate reference  to  intent;
             that  ingredient  of  criminal   responsibility   is   already
             encompassed within the court's existing formulation.)"

13.  In conclusion, at [38] Lord Brown said that:-

         "Put simply, I would hold an accused disqualified under Article  1F
         if there are serious reasons for  considering  him  voluntarily  to
         have contributed in a significant way to the organisation's ability
         to pursue its purpose of committing  war  crimes,  aware  that  his
         assistance will in fact further that purpose."

Bundesrepublik Deutschland v B and D [2011] Imm AR 190

14.  In the case of B and D, as it is commonly  known,  the  German  Federal
    Administrative Court asked the CJEU:-

         (i)  whether it constituted a serious non-political crime or an act
             contrary to the purposes and principles of the United  Nations
             within  the  meaning  of  Article  12(2)(b)  and  (c)  of  the
             Qualification Directive if the person  seeking  asylum  was  a
             member of an organisation which, because of its involvement in
             terrorist acts, was on the list of  entities  annexed  to  the
             Common Position 2001/931 and that  person  actively  supported
             the organisation's armed  struggle  or  occupied  a  prominent
             position within that organisation;


         (ii) whether exclusion from refugee status was conditional upon the
             person concerned continuing to represent a danger for the host
             member state;


         (iii)    whether exclusion from refugee status was conditional upon
             a proportionality test being undertaken in  relation  to  that
             particular case;


         (iv) whether it was compatible with the Qualification Directive for
             a member state  to  recognise  that  a  person  excluded  from
             refugee status had a right of asylum under its  constitutional
             laws.

15.  For present purposes, we are potentially concerned with only the  first
    of those questions.  The CJEU held that exclusion from  refugee  status
    of a person who had  been  a  member  of  an  organisation  which  used
    terrorist methods was conditional on an individual  assessment  of  the
    specific facts, and that before a finding could be  made,  it  must  be
    possible  to  attribute  to  the  person  concerned  a  share  of   the
    responsibility for the acts committed by the organisation of  which  he
    or she was a member.  Individual responsibility had to be  assessed  in
    the light of objective and subjective criteria, and an  assessment  had
    to be made of the true role played  by  the  person  concerned  in  the
    perpetration  of  the  acts  in  question;  his  position  within   the
    organisation; the extent of the knowledge he had or was deemed to  have
    of its activities; any pressure to  which  he  was  exposed;  or  other
    factors likely to have influenced his conduct.

16.  Having examined the relevant case law, it  is  now  possible  fully  to
    appreciate the use to which it was put by the Supreme Court in Al-Sirri
    and DD:-

         "[15]     ... for exclusion from international  refugee  protection
             to be justified, it must be established that there are serious
             reasons  for  considering  that  the  person   concerned   had
             individual responsibility for acts within the scope of article
             1F(c): see the detailed discussion at paras 50 to  75  of  the
             UNHCR "Background  Note".   This  requires  an  individualised
             consideration of the facts of the case, which will include  an
             assessment of the person's involvement in the  act  concerned,
             his mental state and possible grounds for rejecting individual
             responsibility.   As   a   general   proposition,   individual
             responsibility arises where the individual  committed  an  act
             within the scope of article  1F(c),  or  participated  in  its
             commission  in  a  manner  that  gives  rise   to   individual
             responsibility, for example through planning,  instigating  or
             ordering the act in  question,  or  by  making  a  significant
             contribution to the commission of the  relevant  act,  in  the
             knowledge that his act or omission would facilitate  the  act.
             In Bundesrepublik Deutschland v B and D (Joined Cases  C-57/09
             and C-101/09) [2011] Imm AR 190 ("B and D") the Grand  Chamber
             of the Court of Justice of the European  Union  confirmed  the
             requirement of an individualised assessment and held  that  it
             was not justifiable to base a decision to exclude solely on  a
             person's  membership  of  a  group  included  in  a  list   of
             "terrorist organisations".  This too is  consistent  with  the
             approach adopted by  this  Court  in  R  (JS  (Sri  Lanka))  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 1 AC 184.


         [16]  In our view, this  is  the  correct  approach.   The  article
             should be interpreted restrictively and applied with  caution.
             There should be a high threshold  "defined  in  terms  of  the
             gravity of the act in question, the manner in which the act is
             organised, its international impact and long-term  objectives,
             and the implications for international  peace  and  security".
             And there should be serious reasons for considering  that  the
             person concerned bore individual responsibility  for  acts  of
             that character. ..."

Applying the law to the facts of the present case

17.  Whilst we are closely aware of the need to avoid applying  any  "gloss"
    to the relevant case law, in particular by following any methodological
    approach which might restrict the  holistic  nature  of  our  task,  we
    nevertheless agree with Mr  Auburn  that  the  following  headings  may
    provide a useful means of approaching that case law:

         (i)  Nature of the "acts": Has the  appellant  had  involvement  in
             acts which (assuming positive  answer  to  questions  (ii)  to
             (iv)) fall within Article 1F(c)? (A principal issue  addressed
             by the Supreme Court in Al-Sirri and DD);


         (ii)  Seniority/role:  Did  the   appellant   have   a   sufficient
             seniority/role in connection with those acts, so  as  to  fall
             within Article 1F(c)? (the issue in  KJ  (Sri  Lanka).  As  we
             shall later explain, for the purposes  of  the  present  case,
             this heading needs to be approached with caution;


         (iii)    Specificity: Are the allegations against the appellant  of
             sufficient specificity to satisfy the Supreme Court's approach
             in JS (Sri Lanka)?


         (iv) Probability: Is the respondent's case made out to a sufficient
             degree of probability? (as required by Al-Sirri and DD).

The evidence

(a)  The appellant's statement of 5th February 2007

18.  The appellant's first statement was made  within  three  weeks  of  his
    arrival in the United Kingdom.  In it, he described the role played  by
    his brother as a commander with Jamiat-e-Islami, who had 800  to  1,000
    mujahids under his control.  In 1996, the appellant's brother agreed to
    join forces with the Taliban, handing over a senior member of Jamiat to
    the Taliban.  The brother became a  commander  and  the  appellant  was
    given a role as a fighter "and  also  was  given  a  job  as  a  driver
    sometimes.  However, I was mostly a  fighter  and  fought  in  Mazar-e-
    Sharif, Kunduz and also the northern areas  of  Kabul".   The  siblings
    continued to  fight  the  Northern  Alliance  until  the  Taliban  were
    defeated, when the appellant and his brother moved to  Pakistan,  along
    with other family members.  During Ramadan 2004 the appellant  and  his
    brother were at  a  mosque  when  men  started  firing  at  them.   The
    appellant's brother was killed and  the  appellant  was  injured  by  a
    bullet entering his right leg.  After about one and a half months,  the
    appellant moved back to Afghanistan,  where  he  joined  Kashmir  Khan,
    fighting for Hizb-e-Islami: "In  the  battles  I  was  wounded  in  the
    bombardments.  I injured my right and  left  legs  and  right  arm  and
    back."

19.  In September 2006 the appellant was told that his nephew,  the  son  of
    his deceased brother, had been murdered in Peshawar.   A  little  while
    later, Commander Hekmatyar, the leader of  the  forces  with  whom  the
    appellant was fighting, "sent a letter  to  Kashmir  Khan  and  advised
    Kashmir that [the appellant] should be sent to [S] as he is from  there
    and that the war should be such that everyone should be sent  to  their
    home areas to fight".  Deciding that this was too  dangerous  for  him,
    the appellant decided to flee back to Pakistan,  before  travelling  to
    the United Kingdom with the assistance  of  an  agent.   The  statement
    ended with a plea to be granted asylum "as I will be killed if returned
    to my country by the Afghan  government".   The  statement  is  signed,
    underneath written confirmation "that I have had the statement read  to
    me in Pushtu by [interpreter] and it is correct and I wish to  rely  on
    it".

(b)  The appellant's interviews with the respondent

20.  When he arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  appellant  received  a
    screening interview.  In answer  to  the  question  "What  is/was  your
    normal occupation?", he is recorded as having replied  "Commander  with
    Kashmir Khan of Hizb-e-Islami".  He said his reason for coming  to  the
    United Kingdom was that his brother was against the present  government
    and his property had been confiscated by the present regime.

21.  On 30th April 2007,  the  appellant  underwent  a  detailed  interview.
    This was undertaken with the assistance of an interpreter in the Pushtu
    language.  The interview commenced at 10am and  (with  various  breaks)
    concluded at 4.30pm.  At the end, the appellant was recorded as stating
    that he had understood all the questions put to him and had  understood
    the interpreter.

22.  The appellant stated that his  brother  had  become  a  Commander  with
    Jamiat in order to defend Afghanistan against  the  Russian  occupation
    (11).  The appellant  named  seven  Northern  Alliance  commanders  who
    answered to the appellant's brother (15).  The  appellant  was  also  a
    member of Jamiat (16) and by "the end of my brother's time, I  used  to
    be his deputy commander"  (20).   After  the  brother's  death  "I  was
    interested in his post" (22).  Then this:-


         |"23. How many people did you     |I used to carry my brother's     |

|                                 |morally.                         |
|27. What sort of military support|I was provided with intelligence.|

|                                 |I had to gather men and take them|
|                                 |to the front for support and my  |
|                                 |presence there was of moral      |
|                                 |support because they all knew I  |

|29. How many?                    |It is difficult to give you a    |
|                                 |number but depending upon the    |
|                                 |type of war, 50-300 people.      |

|                                 |fighting.  They had a different  |
|                                 |system of fighting.  Every 10 to |
|                                 |20 people had a group leader and |
|                                 |there were a maximum of 10       |
|                                 |groups.                          |
|76. So you were a group leader in|Yes, they used to gather         |
|this system?                     |different groups from different  |
|                                 |areas and then send them to a    |
|                                 |front line.  No one could fight  |
|                                 |his own battle anymore.          |
|77. So your brother could only   |Yes, starting from 100-300       |
|command 10 groups during his time|people.  He would give a few     |
|with the Taliban?                |hundred men for Taliban for a war|
|                                 |but when he commanded a group of |
|                                 |men in a war, these men were not |
|                                 |necessarily his own people.      |
|78. You have stated that your    |It really depends on how things  |
|brother could command a maximum  |were happening.  My brother used |
|of 300 men but in your answer to |to work in completely different  |
|Q75 you stated that he could only|ways and positions.  He had      |
|command a maximum of 200, can you|commanded thousands of people but|
|explain this?                    |when he was engaged in a war in  |
|                                 |the front, he could only control |
|                                 |300 at a time - that was the     |
|                                 |Taliban's strategy.              |
|79. So you command between 10-20 |During Taliban we were allowed to|
|people?                          |command 10 people only but there |
|                                 |were times when they needed all  |
|                                 |the support they could get.      |
|                                 |During that time they needed 20  |
|                                 |people under one commander.      |
|80. And the 10 people you        |Yes, it was called a group.  At  |
|commanded were called a group    |the time I could take 500 men to |
|correct?                         |the front line and easily command|
|                                 |them as well but Taliban had this|
|                                 |system in place where I could not|
|                                 |take many people to war.  This   |
|                                 |was in order to avoid detection  |
|                                 |to the enemy or giving control to|
|                                 |the area to one commander.       |
|81. So how many of these groups  |Depending on the kind of war my  |
|of normally 10 men did your      |brother was fighting it was up to|
|brother have under his control?  |Taliban to decide to give him a  |
|                                 |command of 100 or 300 people.    |
|82. You previously said in your  |I don't know what the difference |
|statement of 25 February 2007    |between these statements is.     |
|that your role at this time was a|When my brother was the head of  |

|answers?                         |remember having an argument with |
|                                 |the interpreter at my solicitor's|
|                                 |office.                          |
|83. Where did you fight for the  |I fought in Kunduz, Mazare Sharif|
|Taliban?                         |and Shamali.                     |
|84. What was the outcome of each |It was a success for Taliban     |
|of these battles?                |side.                            |
|85. What was your group's role in|My group was directly engaged in |
|these battles?                   |fighting.  My responsibility was |
|                                 |to look after them, make sure    |
|                                 |they don't retreat, to take the  |
|                                 |injured to the doctor and in case|
|                                 |of causalities.                  |
|...                              |                                 |
|87. Fighting must have been a    |I used to convince them of the   |
|scary experience for some of your|fact that if the enemy succeeds, |
|men, how did you motivate them to|they could push us back to their |
|fight and continue to fight?     |villages and it could have       |
|                                 |negative consequences.  I used to|
|                                 |regroup at night to attack an    |
|                                 |enemy post, take over the post   |
|                                 |and by morning, the Taliban's    |
|                                 |flag was up and the enemy had    |
|                                 |lost the post and could not take |
|                                 |it back.                         |
|88. What did you and your brother|My brother and I were in         |
|do when the US intervened in     |Shahardara at the time.  We were |
|Afghanistan?                     |fighting the Northern Alliance   |
|                                 |trying to defend the area we     |
|                                 |controlled and we were under     |
|                                 |attack from Americans from the   |
|                                 |air.  Once my brother and I      |
|                                 |realised that we could not win   |
|                                 |this war, we went to Pakistan.   |
|89. Where in Pakistan did you go?|Hayatabab of Peshawar.           |
|90. Why did you go there?        |We went there because the        |
|                                 |Americans won the war.           |
|91. What did you and your brother|We continued with our military   |
|do in Peshawar?                  |skills in Peshawar.  My brother  |
|                                 |was in contact with many         |
|                                 |different people from tribal     |
|                                 |leaders to people in the         |
|                                 |Pakistani government until we    |
|                                 |went back to Kunar, Afghanistan. |
|                                 |                                 |
|                                 |When I came back from Kunar, my  |
|                                 |brother and I were coming back   |
|                                 |home from the local mosque, a    |
|                                 |vehicle stopped and people       |
|                                 |started shooting at us, I got    |
|                                 |injured, I was hit twice, once in|
|                                 |my leg, once in my back.  I still|
|                                 |bear the marks.  We believe that |
|                                 |these men were paid �300,000     |
|                                 |dollars (US) to carry out the    |
|                                 |shooting.  The attack took place |
|                                 |under the orders of Fahim as a   |
|                                 |revenge, also Dr Khalid's brother|
|                                 |was involved.                    |
|92. Why had you not surrendered  |I would not surrender to         |
|in Afghanistan when the US       |Americans even now.              |
|intervened?                      |                                 |
|93. Why did you leave Pakistan   |First of all because of my       |
|for Kunar?                       |brother's death, to carry on his |
|                                 |name and because of the letters  |
|                                 |lead commanders received from    |
|                                 |Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader  |
|                                 |of Hezbe Islami.  It was written |
|                                 |in these letters that all lead   |
|                                 |commanders should go back to     |
|                                 |their area and resist the        |
|                                 |American occupation.             |
|94. Did your brother die in the  |Yes right in front of me.        |
|shooting after you left the      |                                 |
|mosque?                          |                                 |
|95.  When was this?              |This is the third year since he  |
|                                 |died.                            |
|96. When this happened you said  |I went to Kunar 4� months after  |
|that you had just got back from  |my brother died and I got        |

|brother died, can you explain    |Pakistan.  I did not feel secure |
|this?                            |while I was in Pakistan and that |
|                                 |was the main reason why I went   |
|                                 |back to Kunar.  When I was in    |
|                                 |Kunar, my nephew was killed,     |
|                                 |after that I decided to leave the|
|                                 |country.                         |
|...                              |...                              |
|114. What did you do in Kunar?   |I was involved in fighting.      |
|115. Who was your commanding     |Kashmir Khan.                    |

|116. Did you report directly to  |Yes.                             |
|him?                             |                                 |
|117. How many men did he command?|5-600 men approximately.         |
|118. Who commanded Kashmir Khan? |Hikmatyar himself.               |
|119. Who did you fight?          |People who were called enemy by  |
|                                 |Kashmir Khan whether they were   |
|                                 |foreigners or Afghans.           |
|120. What was your role at this  |I had 10-15 people with me.      |
|time?                            |There were 2 Arabs and 1 Afghan  |
|                                 |training us.                     |
|121. What military operations    |I was mostly in Kunar.  I did not|
|were you involved in?            |leave.                           |
|122. Did you fight NATO forces?  |I was fighting anyone who tried  |
|                                 |to take over the area in Kunar   |
|                                 |whether it was NATO or Afghan    |
|                                 |forces.  I was told to resist the|
|                                 |occupation and by fighting I was |
|                                 |doing just that.                 |
|123. Were you able to tell the   |It is easy to establish          |
|difference between NATO and      |foreigners were mostly blonde    |
|Afghan forces?                   |with green or blue eyes and      |
|                                 |Afghan forces look like me.      |
|124. Were you able to distinguish|Afghans had only light equipment.|
|between their military equipment?|They were less protected and less|
|                                 |organised. Foreigners on the     |
|                                 |other hand were well protected   |
|                                 |with heavy artillery, weapons    |
|                                 |that I had never seen before and |
|                                 |air support.                     |
|125. Why did you leave Hezb      |It was not possible for me to    |
|Islami in Kunar?                 |continue as I was still suffering|
|                                 |from my injuries and in the      |
|                                 |meantime Gulbuddin Hikmatyar had |
|                                 |sent a letter to Kashmir Khan    |
|                                 |asking him to send me to Kabul   |
|                                 |province.  I could not go to     |
|                                 |Kabul because I was a known      |
|                                 |person there and because I had   |
|                                 |enemies in Kabul who are high    |
|                                 |ranking people in the government.|
|126. Other than Dr Khalid's      |I fear all people who are        |
|brother who else did you fear in |connected to Rabbani or to the   |
|the government?                  |Northern Alliance.  Karzai's     |
|                                 |government is formed of former   |
|                                 |Jamiat members, leaders and      |
|                                 |fighters and the Northern        |
|                                 |Alliance.  People have been      |
|                                 |killed.  Killings in Afghanistan |
|                                 |have consequences.               |
|127. Could you not ask for a     |No, because you can only fight in|
|different military assignment?   |your own area in Afghanistan     |
|                                 |where you have local support.  If|

(c)  The appellant's statement of 31st May 2007

23.  After receiving a letter dated 27th April  2007  from  the  respondent,
    refusing his asylum claim,  the  appellant  made  a  second  statement,
    responding to that letter.  The statement confirmed "that I have had my
    refusal letter read to me in Pushtu by the interview and I  would  like
    to make the following comments".  At [23] and [24] of the  letter,  the
    respondent doubted the appellant's alleged fear of Hizb-e-Islami.   The
    respondent replied that "I was in the Hizb and was a person with a high
    profile.  The Hizb had power in Kunhar and I was reporting  to  Kashmir
    Khan and he reported to Hekmatyar.  Hekmatyar had given the  leadership
    of the battlefield to Kashmir.  Also Hekmatyar was not given to  public
    access and only a few people met him.  In the present times my  profile
    was a big profile."

24.  At [27] and [28] of the refusal letter, the respondent  noted  apparent
    contradictions in the appellant's evidence as to whether he had or  had
    not joined the Taliban.  In his statement the appellant said "I already
    explained that this was an error on the part of the interpreter.  I was
    asked and I explained that I was a deputy commander in the Taliban  and
    that my brother was  a  commander  in  the  Taliban  and  so  if  after
    negotiations we joined the Taliban then how can we not  be  members  of
    the Taliban  this does not make sense and so is obviously the fault  of
    the Government".  In response to the respondent's concern at [29]  that
    it could not be  the  case  that  individuals  such  as  the  appellant
    commanding just ten to fifteen men would report directly to a prominent
    commander such as Kashmir Khan, the appellant said that  "Kashmir  Khan
    is not a US commander, he is an Afghan commander in the  mountains,  he
    has not helicopters or big offices.  He is in the mountains and  he  is
    with the men.  I was a commander of a small batch of men but I am still
    under the command of Kashmir.  He used to sit with us and eat  with  us
    and was with us all the time ... Regarding the question about my answer
    about my military operations not being sufficient, this is not correct.
     My answer was sufficient.  If you look at the other questions  I  have
    told them about my activities."

(d)  The appellant's statement of 26th September 2007

25.   In  this  short  statement,  made  in  response  to  the  respondent's
    supplementary letter of  6th  August  2007,  in  which  the  respondent
    contended that the appellant was excluded from the  Refugee  Convention
    by reason of Article 1F(c), the respondent said that when  his  brother
    was killed "I fled to Kunar to find protection.   I  was  not  safe  in
    Pakistan and so had to find safety and I was only safe in Kunar as  the
    Hizb-e-Islami had a base there.  I never killed  anyone  and  was  only
    involved in defensive action.  I fought to defend myself".

(e)  The appellant's statement of 24th May 2013

26.   This  statement  is  strikingly  different  from   previous   recorded
    utterances of the appellant, both in writing and at the hearing  before
    Immigration Judge Simpson.  It is also at significant variance with the
    facts as stated by Lady Hale and Lord Dyson in  Al-Sirri  and  DD  (see
    above).  The appellant blames interpreters and his previous  solicitors
    for misstating him in his previous written statements.  He also asserts
    that "I never understood the meaning of exclusion until  very  recently
    when this was explained to me when my case proceeded to higher court."

27.  The appellant's true role, he says, was as follows:-

         "3.  I would like to submit that I was not a fighter as  such.   My
             role was that of a moral [sic] booster to my brother's  troop.
             I was mainly a driver and I referred to my interview  where  I
             had said that I would command 50 to 300 people, in fact I mean
             by this statement that I would transport 50 to 300  people  at
             my brother's orders.  I was again asked what  kinds  of  tasks
             did your brother give you? My reply is  recorded  -  to  fight
             against the enemies - I mean by  this  that  I  would  support
             fighters by bringing them around and providing them with  food
             and other supplies."

28.  The statement continues that the appellant "had no  importance  within"
    Jamiat and that he "was not directly involved with"  the  Taliban.   He
    also had  "no  involvement"  with  Hizb-e-Islami:  "the  nature  of  my
    involvement was minimal and I fled from  fighting  with  them.   I  had
    never known their objectives and the fact that they are  considered  as
    terrorist organisation.  I only learned this recently".

29.  The central strand of the new  statement  is  that  the  appellant  was
    simply doing as his brother requested.  During the time of the Taliban,
    the other deputy called Mujahid "was the one who had a  prominent  role
    within the party", in contrast to the appellant who had "taken part  in
    the fights but never had a major involvement.  My brother would want me
    to stay behind as he did not want me to get killed".  Having  correctly
    said in answer to question 85 of the  interview  that  his  group  "was
    engaged in fights", the appellant states that  "my  responsibility  was
    just to look after them, watch  them  and  take  the  injured  ones  to
    hospital for treatment".  As for his time with Kashmir Khan,  "although
    I was engaged in fights I was a backup since I had injuries so I  could
    not take part directly in the fight".  The appellant  had  "simply  got
    involved to find a shelter".  He had  left  Hizb-e-Islami  and  Kashmir
    Khan as soon as he could "get a chance I was with them for  two  months
    approximately".  The appellant is "against killing and I confirm that I
    have not killed anyone in my entire life".  He  was  "just  helping  my
    brother".  The appellant is "saddened by the fact that this  government
    has portrayed me as a criminal.  I am just an ordinary human being  who
    has come to this country to save  his  life.   I  wanted  to  work  and
    contribute to the welfare of this society".

(f)  The appellant's statement of 5 June 2013

30.  In his statement of 5 June 2013, the appellant said that when  he  gave
    his statement of May 2007, his case was being handled by  another  firm
    of solicitors, which had since "closed down".  The  appellant  asserted
    that none of his statements  had  been  read  back  to  him,  with  the
    interpreter simply saying to him that he should sign the  document,  as
    it was about his case.  The appellant was not even given a  translation
    of the statement.  The appellant reiterated that his interview and  the
    refusal letter had never been read back to him, contrary  to  what  was
    said in  the  statement  of  May  2007.   The  same  was  true  of  the
    appellant's statement of September 2007 and the  supplementary  refusal
    letter of the respondent.  As  to  these,  the  interpreter  asked  the
    appellant only one question, which  was  "have  you  killed  anyone  in
    Afghanistan and I answered  no  I  have  never  killed  anyone,  I  was
    defending my brother and myself".

(g) The evidence given to Immigration Judge Simpson

31.  Immigration Judge Simpson recorded the  following  evidence,  regarding
    the appellant's involvement with the Taliban:-

         "71. The Appellant was pressed as whether he was a full  member  of
             the Taliban to which he responded; he was still deputy for his
             brother; he was under the command of his brother; the  Taliban
             gave orders to his brother and his brother gave orders to him;
             his brother was a commander for the Taliban;  they  were  with
             the Taliban.  The Appellant  was  referred  to  the  interview
             (AIR8) when he had said he was not a member  of  the  Taliban,
             and  he  responded  when  a  brother   was   related   to   an
             organisation, like his brother and the Taliban, he  could  not
             be in another party.


         72.  He was pressed again on  saying  he  was  not  a  member,  and
             Counsel for the Appellant objected asking that the entirety of
             the question and response in the interview be  translated  for
             the benefit of the Appellant,  which  was  done  (and  put  in
             context beginning with question 7 and his response followed by
             8 and his response).  The Appellant stated that  the  way  the
             Taliban worked was that the commanders were with the  Taliban.
             They were the members.  Not every individual."

32.  She also recorded the following  evidence  concerning  the  appellant's
    activities with Hizb-e-Islami, following his return from Pakistan:-

         "74. The Appellant was referred to his third statement and that his
             actions for Hizb-e-Islami were 'only ... defensive' and as  to
             what he actually did:


                  'I had not gone after anybody.  I did not attack  anybody,
                  only involved in defending myself.  If  somebody  attacked
                  me I defend myself.'


              He confirmed that he was in charge of ten to fifteen men  and
             was asked what actions they were involved  in.   He  variously
             referred to them as being friends  whose  lives  had  been  in
             danger and had fled, they were drivers, bodyguards  etc.   The
             Appellant was pressed as to what their day to day role was  in
             Hizb-e-Islami, and he responded:


                  'These  ten  to  fifteen  men  were  with  me,  defending,
                  protecting me, they were not involved in going to fight or
                  anything else.'


         75.  He continued to reiterate they were involved only in defending
             themselves, when asked whether he was involved in arm  to  arm
             fighting  (which  I  ensured  through   the   interpreter   he
             understood in his own language).   Government  forces  knowing
             Hizb-e-Islami people were in the mountains would come and they
             would have to defend themselves.  They would be attacked  with
             rocket launchers, Kalashnikovs.  They  also  had  Kalashnikovs
             and rocket launchers 'all for our own defence'.  He  had  been
             with Hizb-e-Islami for five to six months altogether.   As  to
             whether any of his men were killed he responded  that  no  one
             was killed but one was injured.  As to whether any people they
             fought were killed, he had not seen anyone shot with his  'own
             eyes'.


         ...


         79.      As to Hizb-e-Islami and  the  organisation's  beliefs,  he
             responded  they  were  to  fight  the   government   and   the
             foreigners, adding that 'personally ... he  did  not  want  to
             fight either, he did not  want  to  hurt  anyone  or  be  hurt
             himself'.  The party did not  want  to  see  peace  coming  to
             Afghanistan.  As to why, he responded they believed foreigners
             had taken the country by force and did not want foreign forces
             to be in the country."

(h) Immigration Judge Simpson's findings

33.  For our purposes, the following findings of Immigration  Judge  Simpson
    are of relevance:

         "120.    Altogether in the context of the above background evidence
             I consider plausible that Commander [D]  would  have  gathered
             close to him those who he could trust, and  having  a  brother
             younger than him would reasonably have had that brother  close
             to him from a young age, increasingly  assisting  him  in  all
             ways, and with time  and  experience  being  given  increasing
             responsibilities, including the position of  deputy.   It  was
             the consistent evidence of the Appellant that  he  was  simply
             'always'  with  his  brother,  and  it  was  effectively  when
             interviewed and in detail when specifically  asked  about  his
             role in respect of the brother that he evidence  emerged  that
             'at the end' of his brother's time in Jamiat he was his deputy
             commander. (AIR - asylum interview record 20)


         ...


         126. The weight of detail, the consistency of  the  detail  in  the
             Appellant's   combined   accounts,   three   statements,   two
             interviews and his oral evidence at the hearing, together with
             its consistency with the history of events in  Afghanistan  at
             the time, and specifically its military and political  history
             and the various actors I find I accept the Appellant did  show
             to the requisite standard that his brother was Commander  [D],
             that  he  became  increasingly  closely  associated  with  his
             brother, a commander in the Jamiat-e-Islami, and followed with
             his brother and his militia to the Taliban in 1996,  and  that
             he did become a deputy to his brother, variously assisting him
             in the ways he described and also as a fighter.


         127. With regard to the credible detail of the Appellant's evidence
             as to his familiarity with military matters I consider  to  be
             the familiar ease he had in describing the differing modes  of
             fighting as between the Jamiat-e-Islami and the  Taliban,  and
             the dynamic of  the  Taliban  in  its  small  group  fighting,
             seeking to ensure  that  individual  commanders  do  not  have
             command of large numbers of men, and further those men of whom
             they have command not necessarily including their own militia.


         ...


         136. With regard  to  Hizb-e-Islami  and  the  Appellant's  claimed
             involvement,  I  observed  what   appeared   to   be   certain
             discrepancies in the evidence about their activity after going
             to Pakistan, that is between 2001 and 2004,  and  after.   The
             Appellant  claimed  after  leaving  Afghanistan  for  Pakistan
             following the fall of the Taliban he had been to  Kunar  once.
             (AIR 5) Following the killing of his brother for his safety he
             went to Afghanistan and joined Hizb-e-Islami  in  Kunar.   The
             timing of  his  going  to  Kunar  after  his  brother's  death
             appeared to differ between his evidence at the interview, four
             and a half months after his brother  died  (AIR  96)  and  his
             evidence at the hearing that it was the day following  leaving
             hospital after being treated for one and a half months.   More
             material however was the Appellant's response at the interview
             when asked what he and his brother  did  in  Peshawar  and  he
             responded:


                  '91... we continued with our military skills in  Peshawar.
                      My brother was in contact with many different  people
                      from tribunal leaders  to  people  in  the  Pakistani
                      government until we went back to Kunar, Afghanistan.


                       When I came back from Kunar, my brother  and  I  were
                      coming back home from the local  mosque.   A  vehicle
                      stopped and people started  shooting  at  us,  I  got
                      injured, I was hit twice.  Once in my leg, once in my
                      back.  I still bear the marks...'


         ...


         139. Although differing  organisations  or  movements  the  various
             background evidence does show degrees of  association  between
             the  Taliban  and  Hizb-e-Islami  Hekmatayar,  and  also   the
             presence of Hizb-e-Islami Hekmatayar led by  Kashmir  Khan  in
             Kunar.  The Appellant described methods  of  organisation  and
             fighting in Hezb-e-Islami not dissimilar to the Taliban, which
             would be consistent with their degree of association.   Having
             faced and been in the thick of the assassination of his  older
             brother with whom he had spent much of  his  life,  I  do  not
             consider inconsistent that having faced this  mortal  risk  in
             Pakistan, that he sought,  together  with  others  from  their
             village, to return to Afghanistan and its isolated  areas  and
             seek the protection of a military grouping.  I accept that the
             Appellant therefore did show to the lower standard  he  became
             involved with Hizb-e-Islami in Afghanistan.


         140. As to the  Respondent's  consideration  that  the  Appellant's
             account of his involvement of commanding just ten  to  fifteen
             men and reporting to  Commander  Kashmir  Khan  not  to  be  a
             credible account  of  a  role  and  profile  in  Hezb-e-Islami
             Hekmatayar, I consider that this lacks a  real  grasp  of  the
             differing modes of warfare of such groups  in  the  conditions
             they fight and in the country they fight, Afghanistan.


         141. Having regard to the close association with Commander  [D],  a
             prominent member  both  in  Jamiat-e-Islami  followed  by  the
             Taliban, I consider that the Appellant's involvement in Hizb-e-
             Islami has to be evaluated  against  that  history,  and  that
             there is a reasonable likelihood that  he  would  have  as  he
             claimed a high profile.


         142. It is not inconsistent upon receiving orders  that  he  should
             join Hizb-e-Islami in Kabul, that proximity  to  the  family's
             former enemies would have been a material consideration in the
             Appellant's thinking, having regard to what, I accept,  was  a
             well-known history of his brother  having  been  assassinated,
             and the background behind the 'settling of scores' that led to
             this  assassination,  and  that  the  Appellant  in  his  home
             province would have real fears  of  being  well-known  and  at
             risk.


         ...


         146. I accept that the Appellant was a fighter  with  Hizb-e-Islami
             Hekmatayar in the province of Kunar in  Afghanistan  prior  to
             leaving Afghanistan.  As to the period  of  involvement  there
             appeared some uncertainty concerning its  duration  but  I  do
             consider the Appellant's estimate of some five to  six  months
             reasonably likely to be low and given in an effort to minimize
             his involvement, having regard  to  his  earlier  evidence  at
             interview  to  have  gone  to  Kunar  to  Hizb-e-Islami  after
             recovering from being shot in Ramadan 2004.


         147. The Appellant's evidence was  that  they  were  fighting  both
             Afghan government forces and also foreign forces, that is  the
             UN authorised forces.  The Appellant was clearly familiar with
             the differences between the two sets of forces.  There was  no
             positive evidence that Hizb-e-Islami Hekmatayar  actions  were
             not against the  international  forces,  rather  Hizb-e-Islami
             actions were about resisting Afghan government forces and  the
             'occupation'.  The Appellant described at certain  stages  his
             military involvement with Hizb-e-Islami  as  being  defensive.
             However having regard to the evidence of  increasing  counter-
             insurgency in Afghanistan I consider this to  be  implausible.
             I found the Appellant credibly to have a longstanding  history
             of military involvement in Afghanistan, including  at  a  high
             level, deputy to his Commander brother,  and  independently  a
             Commander in Hizb-e-Islami Hekmatayar in  Kunar.   I  consider
             that there are prima facie grounds for  considering  that  his
             actions with Hizb-e-Islami Hekmatayar in Afghanistan were both
             offensive  and  defensive.   However  I  accept   neither   at
             interview or  in  cross-examination  was  there  elicited  any
             specificity about his actions or incidents."

(i) The appellant's oral evidence on 26 June 2013

34.  The appellant gave evidence with the assistance of an  interpreter.  We
    were fully satisfied that he the appellant  and  the  interpreter  were
    able to communicate satisfactorily, and no issue as to the adequacy  of
    interpretation arose at the  hearing.  The  appellant  was  extensively
    cross-examined by Mr Auburn about his  most  recent  statements,  which
    attempted to paint a fundamentally  different  picture,  compared  with
    that given by the appellant earlier.   It  was  put  to  him  that,  as
    regards  the  Home  Office  interview,  there  were  several   recorded
    instances of the appellant indicating if he did not understand,  and/or
    of the interpreter clarifying  matters  (e.g.  68  and  146).   It  was
    suggested to the appellant that these indicated that he was aware  when
    difficulties were arising during the interview.  The appellant  had  no
    coherent answer to this, merely reiterating that he did not  understand
    various questions.

35.  The appellant said that he had signed  his  name  at  the  end  of  the
    interview record, to the effect that he understood all of the questions
    put to him, because that is what the interpreter told him to do and  he
    was "quite frightened at the time".  Mr Auburn  put  to  the  appellant
    that it was surprising for him to give an answer if he did not consider
    it to be true.  The appellant replied that this had had happened to him
    quite often and other interpreters used by his  former  solicitors  had
    told him that he should sign a document, because it was in his interest
    to do so.

36.  Asked if he was aware that the interview was important for his  future,
    the appellant replied that no one had told him  it  was  important  for
    him.  He reiterated that he  was  unaware  that  the  interview  was  a
    serious matter, because no one had told him this.  Mr Auburn put to the
    appellant that this was simply not believable, to which  the  appellant
    responded: "it is up to you".

37.  Asked if he had made a written  complaint  about  the  actions  of  his
    previous solicitors, the appellant said that he was not even aware that
    there had been difficulties with  the  previous  statements  until  the
    "last hearing".  This meant that he had not been aware of the  problems
    with the earlier statements at  the  two  previous  Tribunal  hearings;
    since it was not until two or three months ago that he  had  discovered
    the difficulties.  This meant, the appellant accepted,  that  his  case
    had been to the Supreme Court without him being aware of  the  contents
    of the statements and of the problems with the interview.  When it  was
    put to him that this was not credible, the appellant reiterated that it
    was "up to you".

38.  It was put to the appellant that in his  statement  of  31st  May  2007
    (sometimes referred to as 30th May) he had said that  he  had  had  his
    interviews read to him in Pushtu and that the May 2007  statement  then
    took issue with specific aspects of the respondent's letter of refusal.
     The appellant responded that the interpreter "hadn't told me  anything
    about this".  No one had read the refusal letter  to  him  in  his  own
    language.  Mr Auburn suggested that could not be right,  to  which  the
    appellant responded that "if you look at the documents you will find no
    proof the documents  have  been  translated  to  me  in  Pushtu".   The
    appellant  then  re-iterated  that  his  solicitors  had,  in   effect,
    concocted statements on his behalf.

39.  Regarding question 20 of the interview, the appellant said that he  was
    not the deputy of his brother.  Someone else had had that role.  Again,
    the problem was one of mistranslation.  To be a  deputy,  according  to
    the appellant, meant that one was involved in the military, whereas his
    role "was more like a family".  In Afghan culture, if one's brother was
    a commander, people would call you a commander because of your brother.
         The appellant said that he was not his brother's deputy and simply
    helped his brother to transport 300 to 350  people  from  one  area  to
    another.

40.  The appellant was  asked  about  his  answer  at  question  70  in  the
    interview, where he said that after his brother joined the  Taliban  "I
    was still my brother's deputy.  I still  had  to  go  to  war  with  my
    brother's fighters".  The appellant replied that he had not gone to war
    anywhere at that time, and he had not gone to  war  "the  second  time,
    especially after the US occupation of Afghanistan".  It was put to  the
    appellant that it would have been a huge mistake by the interpreter  to
    say what was recorded at question 70.  The appellant  replied  that  he
    could show Mr  Auburn  lots  of  interpreters  who  were  not  properly
    qualified.  So far as question 71 was concerned,  where  the  appellant
    said that his brother had had another deputy as well  as  himself,  the
    appellant said that his brother had only one deputy.

41.  In answer to interview  question  123,  "Were  you  able  to  tell  the
    difference between NATO and Afghan forces?" the appellant was  recorded
    as saying that it was "easy to establish foreigners were mostly  blonde
    with green or blue  eyes  and  Afghan  forces  looked  like  me".   The
    appellant said that he had not, in fact, seen foreign forces  with  his
    own eyes in Afghanistan, and had said what he had on the basis of  what
    he had seen on TV, whilst in Pakistan.

42.  The appellant was asked whether  he  accepted  that,  whoever  was  his
    brother's deputy would have been highly likely to have  seen  fighting.
    The appellant eventually responded in the affirmative, since the second
    in command "would have been involved in the fighting".

43.  The appellant was asked about  the  evidence  recorded  by  Immigration
    Judge Simpson, to the effect  that  the  appellant  was  his  brother's
    deputy.  The appellant appeared to ascribe this  to  difficulties  with
    translation of the word "deputy" in Pushtu.  As regards the  answer  to
    interview question 22, where the appellant was recorded as saying  that
    after his  brother's  death  he  was  "interested  in  his  post",  the
    appellant said that this did not refer to his brother's  military  role
    but was on a "family basis".  Asked about the answer  to  question  28:
    "did you command men in a fight? - yes", the appellant  indicated  that
    this was wrong and that he would  merely  help  his  brother  transport
    people to the war zone and bring back the injured: "Taking  ten  people
    to the front line is regarded  in  our  culture  as  commanding".   The
    appellant then said that being a commander meant giving people military
    orders to fire mortars and such things and did not refer  to  a  person
    who merely transported people to the front line.  The appellant did not
    give military orders.

44.  The  appellant  was  asked  about  this  question  and  answer  in  the
    interview record:

|"93. Why did you leave Pakistan  |First of all because of my       |
|for Kunar?                       |brother's death, to carry on his |
|                                 |name and because of the letters  |
|                                 |lead commanders received from    |
|                                 |Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader  |
|                                 |of Hezbe Islami.  It was written |
|                                 |in these letters that all lead   |
|                                 |commanders should go back to     |
|                                 |their area and resist the        |
|                                 |American occupation."            |

45.  The appellant said that he left  Pakistan  for  Kunar  because  he  was
    scared that someone would kill him.  He denied going  to  Kunar  to  be
    involved in military activities.  The letters "were  actually  sent  to
    other commanders and I was told I should go as well but I  was  injured
    at the  time".   The  interview  record  was,  accordingly,  incorrect,
    according to the appellant.

46.  The appellant was asked about [19] of his  statement  of  5th  February
    2007:

         "Then about four months ago Hekmatayar sent  a  letter  to  Kashmir
         Khan and advised Kashmir that the [appellant] should be sent to [S]
         as he is from there and that the war should be such  that  everyone
         should be sent to their home areas to fight."

47.  The appellant said he did not know Hekmatayar.  It was put to him  that
    the evidence regarding the letter  indicated  just  how  important  the
    appellant had been.  The appellant responded that he  was  not  a  high
    ranking person.  Kashmir Khan  had  been  told  to  inform  "the  other
    commanders and he told me as well".

48.  In answer to interview question 31: "What weapons were your  men  armed
    with?", the appellant had described a range of weapons  from  light  to
    heavy artillery.  He said he had only seen these with his  brother  and
    his brother's people.  It was put to him that, in such a case,  it  was
    strange that he had not indicated that they were  not  the  appellant's
    men.

49.  Mr Auburn suggested to the appellant  that  his  answers  to  interview
    questions 32 to 34 suggested a thorough knowledge of  military  matters
    and weapons.   The  appellant  replied  that  there  had  been  war  in
    Afghanistan for the past 35 years and even a two year old child in that
    country would be able to name "all artilleries".   That  would  include
    the accurate firing range of an AK47.  Asked about question  122:  "Did
    you fight NATO forces? - I was fighting anyone who tried to  take  over
    the area in Kunar whether it was NATO or Afghan forces.  I was told  to
    resist the occupation and by fighting.  I was  doing  just  that",  the
    appellant said that he had not said that,  and  said  that  if  anybody
    wanted to kill him, then he would defend himself.

50.  In re-examination, the appellant said that Kashmir  Khan  knew  of  the
    appellant only through his brothers and that  the  appellant  had  seen
    Kashmir Khan  only  once  during  the  relevant  time.   The  appellant
    remembered only 20 to 25% of the questions and answers at the interview
    in April 2007.  He was not his brother's deputy.  That would have  been
    the person called Mr Mujadid.  Asked about the letter  from  Hekmatayar
    to Kashmir Khan, which suggested the appellant was  a  lead  commander,
    the appellant said that he was not and that possibly his brother  would
    have got such a letter had he been alive.


(j) Background evidence

51.  The COI Report of April 2007 on  Afghanistan  has  this  to  say  about
    Hekmatayar and Hezb-e-Islami:-

         "11.81   On 14 September 2004, the  Institute  for  War  and  Peace
                Reporting reported that Hekmatyar was designated a terrorist
                by  the  US  State   Department   in   February   2003   for
                participation in and support for terrorist acts committed by
                al-Qaeda and the Taleban. [73n]


         11.82    In September 2004 the UN-appointed independent  expert  of
                the Commission on Human Rights noted that Hizb-I  Islami  is
                one of the groups in addition to the  Taliban  and  Al-Qaida
                known as "anti-Coalition forces" or "anti-Government forces"
                which   represent   a   significant   security   threat   in
                Afghanistan. "They have engaged in steady acts of relatively
                small-scale  violence,  targeted  assassinations,  bombings,
                rocket attacks and occasional armed assaults."  [39k] (para
                36)


         11.83    An International Crisis Group (ICG) briefing dated 2  June
                2005 stated:


               "In  May  2004,  a  delegation  from  the  party's  executive
                committee, based in Peshawar, Pakistan, travelled  to  Kabul
                to pledge support for the Karzai government. Led  by  Khaled
                Farooqi, a Pashtun from Paktiya province, the group  claimed
                to have broken with Hikmatyar [Hekmatyar] and  declared  its
                intentions to participate in the political process...  Given
                Hikmatyar's  long-time  absolute  control  over  the   party
                machinery,  many  observers  believe  he  may   still   have
                influence, especially since Farooqi has yet  to  demonstrate
                his ability to lead the party. However, many  former  Hizb-e
                Islami commanders in the north and south did support  Karzai
                during the presidential elections, and many of them now hold
                key positions  in  Kabul  and  provincial  administrations."
                [26e] (p8)


         11.84    A Danish fact-finding mission to Kabul in March/April 2004
                reported in November 2004 that, according  to  UNHCR,  there
                are small  groups  of  Hezb-e-Islami  (Hekmatyar)  in  Kunar
                province. According  to  the  source,  "Nobody  knows  where
                Hekmatyar himself is living. Some of his men work  with  the
                Taliban. In the opinion of the source, Hekmatyar's  position
                is weak." [8] (section 6.8)


         11.85    The  Danish  fact-finding  report  also  noted:  "The  ICG
                [International Crisis Group] was of the opinion that Hezb-e-
                Islami does not exist today as a political party, but  could
                be characterized better as a loose structure  of  individual
                warlords." [8] (section 6.8)


         11.86    Reports by the Afghanistan Justice Project (AJP) published
                on 29 January  2005  [13a]  and  17  July  2005  [13b]  give
                detailed information on  war  crimes  committed  by  various
                individuals and parties, including Hizb-i-Islami, during the
                years of conflict (1978-2001) in  Afghanistan.  The  January
                report focuses particularly on  the  post-1992  period.  The
                reports  should  be  referred   to   directly   if   further
                information on the activities of Hizb-i-Islami during  those
                years is required. (See Annex F source numbers [13a] [13b])"

52.   The  2005  Human  Rights  Watch  Report:  Blood-Stained  Hands:   Past
    Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity  mentions  the
    appellant's brother on a number of occasions, including  in  connection
    with the 1993 military Afshar campaign.  There is also this:-

         "R.D., a former official in the interim government who was familiar
         with ongoing  criminality  by  various  factions,  said  that  [the
         appellant's brother], a high-level commander in Shura-e Nazar,  was
         'deeply involved in kidnapping schemes,'..."

53.  The activities of Hezb-e-Islami  and  its  leader  Gulbuddin  Hekmatyar
    during the early 1990s are also covered in the report, which  describes
    Hezb-e-Islami  forces  as  having  "committed   grave   violations   of
    international humanitarian law by intentionally targeting civilians and
    civilian areas for attack, ordered indiscriminately attacking areas  in
    Kabul  without  distinguishing  between  civilian  areas  and  military
    targets".  Hezb-e-Islami was said to have  "had  the  capacity  to  arm
    artillery at military targets, but  purposefully  or  recklessly  fired
    artillery at civilian objects instead, in  violation  of  international
    humanitarian law.  They were also "implicated in murders,  pillage  and
    looting in violation of international humanitarian law".

Our assessment of the appellant's evidence

54.  We do not find credible the appellant's  attempt  to  resile  from  his
    earlier statements, as set out in both the record of  April  2007  Home
    Office interview and the statements of February and May  2007.   It  is
    simply not believable that the appellant was  not  just  ill-served  by
    one, but by each and every one of the interpreters  he  encountered  at
    that time.  The record of the Home Office interview amply  demonstrates
    the evident care that the interpreter on that occasion took to  clarify
    matters, when occasion demanded, as well as the appellant's ability  to
    say when he did not understand a particular matter.  The  statement  of
    May 2007 specifically takes  issue  with  specific  paragraphs  of  the
    respondent's letter of refusal.  It simply beggars belief that a  well-
    known and respected firm of  solicitors  in  the  field  (White  Ryland
    Solicitors)  would  concoct  this  document,  without  input  from  the
    appellant.  It is equally unbelievable  that,  if  what  the  appellant
    tells us is true, these fundamental problems  with  the  interview  and
    written statements would not have come to light before or  at  the  two
    hearings of the appellant's appeal - in particular, the hearing  before
    Immigration Judge Simpson - or,  failing  that,  upon  receipt  of  the
    resulting determinations.

55.  Instead, the appellant would have us believe that  everyone  concerned,
    even  the  Supreme  Court,   proceeded   on   a   profoundly   mistaken
    understanding of the facts of his case.  Mr Jacobs submitted  that  the
    issue in the Supreme Court was whether  military  action  against  ISAF
    could, as a matter of law, fall within Article  1F(c).   However,  even
    whilst acknowledging that the Supreme Court was not involved in  making
    an individualised assessment of the facts, it would plainly  have  been
    pertinent to have told that Court that the appellant's case was that he
    had never been a fighter in Afghanistan.

56.  In so finding, we are aware that, in his statement  of  26th  September
    2007, made after receipt of the supplementary letter  invoking  Article
    1F(c), the appellant asserted that he "never killed anyone and was only
    involved in defensive  action.   I  fought  to  defend  myself".   That
    stance, however, is markedly different to the one now  adopted  by  the
    appellant, in which he denies that he was deputy commander, denies  any
    direct military activities (whether defensive or otherwise),  paints  a
    picture of his being concerned only with  transportation  (particularly
    of the wounded  to  hospital)  and  ascribes  the  position  of  deputy
    commander during his brother's lifetime entirely to the person known as
    Mujadid.

57.  The stance adopted by the appellant in his  latest  statements  and  in
    evidence before us is, in short, completely disingenuous.  Not only  do
    we reject that stance; it powerfully points to what  is,  we  consider,
    the true position.  This  is  that  what  the  appellant  said  in  his
    February 2007 statement and April 2007 interview with the  Home  Office
    represents the truth, and that even the less extreme  position  adopted
    in the  statement  of  September  2007  and  before  Immigration  Judge
    Simpson, that the appellant's military activities with Hizb-e-Islami in
    2004/2006 were purely "defensive", is also untrue.  As  we  have  seen,
    Immigration Judge Simpson found at [147] that the  appellant's  actions
    with Hizb-e-Islami "were both offensive and  defensive".   We  entirely
    agree. We also consider that the reason why  the  appellant  wishes  to
    resile from his statements about being a deputy commander is  that,  as
    he acknowledged in his interview (see  [42]  above)  and  in  his  oral
    evidence to us  ([43]  above),   being  a  commander   involved  giving
    military orders to use weaponry against opponents.

58.  We also find ourselves in agreement  with  the  judge,  that  the  true
    nature of the appellant's involvement and profile with Hizb-e-Islami in
    2004/2006 falls to be evaluated  against  his  profile  and  activities
    before that time, both with the Taliban and, earlier, with Jamiat.   It
    is entirely incredible that a seasoned military  leader,  used  to  the
    command of several hundred men  in  the  field,  as  described  by  the
    appellant at his interview,  would  suddenly  morph  into  a  reluctant
    combatant, engaged only in "defensive" activities.  We  have  no  doubt
    that this point struck the appellant, at some point  following  receipt
    of  Judge  Simpson's  determination:  hence  his  belated  unsuccessful
    attempt to portray himself throughout as a non-combatant.

59.  We accordingly conclude that the appellant was speaking  the  truth  to
    his Home Office interviewer in April 2007 and that what he was recorded
    as then saying is  what  he  actually  said  and  meant  to  say.   The
    appellant's answers in respect of  the  period  after  he  returned  to
    Afghanistan from Pakistan (when ISAF was deployed in Afghanistan) fall,
    where necessary,  to  be  interpolated  by  reference  to  his  earlier
    activities, during the lifetime of his brother.  Like Judge Simpson, we
    do not believe the appellant's claim to have been engaging in  fighting
    for only a few months during that  last  period  (a  mere  two  months,
    according to the appellant's  latest  evidence).   Whilst  we  have  no
    reason to doubt the claim that the appellant was motivated to return by
    fear for his safety in Pakistan, following  the  assassination  of  his
    brother and his own wounding at the mosque, it was in  his  established
    role as a military leader and  fighter  that  the  appellant  chose  to
    return.

60.  Whilst we  accept  that,  during  the  lifetime  of  his  brother,  the
    appellant had a lower profile than his sibling, we are fully  satisfied
    on all the evidence that the appellant's own  profile  was  significant
    and correctly described by him as that of a deputy  commander,  in  the
    military sense.  Following his brother's  death,  the  evidence  points
    clearly to the appellant's continuing to be  regarded  as  a  prominent
    military figure.  We find that, in answer to question 93, the appellant
    was describing a letter sent to him (as well as to  other  leaders)  by
    Hekmatayar, and that he was one of the "lead commanders" who was called
    "back to their area to resist the American occupation".   That  finding
    is supported by paragraph 19 of the appellant's statement  of  February
    2007, which describes  Kashmir  Khan  as  having  been  sent  a  letter
    advising that the appellant should be sent to his home area  to  fight.
    That is evidence of  the  appellant's  continuing  to  be  regarded  by
    Hekmatayar as a person of significance.  Like Judge Simpson, we do  not
    consider that Hizb-e-Islami's command structure, in which the appellant
    was in charge of far fewer men then in the days of  Jamiat,  is  to  be
    taken  as  any  indication  of  his  insignificance  in  the  eyes   of
    Hekmatayar.   On  the  contrary,  as  the  appellant's   own   evidence
    indicates, the purpose of that command structure  was  to  ensure  that
    individual commanders did not become too powerful.

61.  As for the appellant's involvement with Kashmir  Khan,  we  reject  the
    appellant's assertion that he saw this individual only  once.   Indeed,
    the statement of the appellant of 31st May 2007 is  somewhat  indignant
    on the matter of Kashmir Khan:

         "I was a commander of a small bunch of men but I  was  still  under
         the command of Kashmir who used to sit with us and eat with us  and
         was with us all the time."

62.  That answer accords fully with interview questions 115 and 117  of  the
    interview, where the appellant said that  his  commanding  officer  was
    Kashmir Khan; that he reported directly to Kashmir Khan; and  that  the
    latter had the command of approximately 500-600 men.

63.  In  making  our  findings,  we  have  had  regard  to  the  appellant's
    obviously detailed knowledge of weaponry.  He told us that every  child
    in Afghanistan has such  a  knowledge,  given  the  chronic  nature  of
    conflict in that region.  Whilst  we  accept  that  an  Afghan  child's
    knowledge of such matters may well be greater than that of his  or  her
    Western European counterpart, it remains a striking fact that the  Home
    Office interviewer had to stop the appellant from naming  every  single
    part of an AK47 and that the appellant knew precisely how  to  clear  a
    jam in that weapon.  These answers reveal first-hand direct  experience
    of using an AK 47. They are  strongly  indicative  of  the  appellant's
    using such a weapon regularly, whilst in combat.

64.  We find that, upon his  return  to  Pakistan,  the  appellant  had  the
    command of ten to fifteen people (Q120)  and  that  he  fought  against
    anyone regarded by Hizb-e-Islami as the "enemy ...  whether  they  were
    foreigners or Afghans" (Q119).  That  included  "NATO"  (ISAF)  forces.
    This is the plain thrust of the appellant's answer to Q122, read in the
    light of all the other  credible  evidence.   We  reject  entirely  the
    appellant's belated assertion that he knew the difference between  NATO
    and Afghan forces merely as a result of watching TV in Pakistan.  Apart
    from anything else, watching TV would not elicit  the  answer  to  Q124
    that:

         "Afghans had only light equipment, they  were  less  protected  and
         less organised.  Foreigners on the other hand were  well  protected
         with the army artillery, weapons that I had never seen before ..."

Applying the law to our findings of fact

65.  On the basis of our findings of fact, it is  now  necessary  to  decide
    whether the appellant is excluded from the benefits of the 1951 Refugee
    Convention, by reason of Article 1F(c).  It is common ground  that  the
    respondent's case in this regard turns on what happened in  Afghanistan
    in 2004 to 2006.  As we have explained,  the  appellant's  actions  and
    profile  before  he  went  to  Pakistan  in  2001  have  a  direct  and
    significant bearing on what really happened in 2004-2006. But it is not
    the respondent's case that the appellant falls to be excluded from  the
    Refugee Convention, directly by reference to what  he  did  before  the
    ISAF force was deployed.

66.  We return to the four-fold categorisation described at [17] above.   As
    will become apparent, useful though that categorisation is, as a  guide
    to applying the relevant case law on Article 1F,  the  issues  are  not
    hermetically sealed.  To treat them as such would be to misconstrue the
    case law.

(i) Nature of the "acts"

67.  We remind ourselves of what the Supreme Court held at [68] of  Al-Sirri
    and DD:-

         "In short, an attack on ISAF is in principle capable  of  being  an
         act contrary to the purposes and principles of the United  Nations.
         The fundamental aims and objectives of ISAF accord with  the  first
         purpose stated in article 1 of  the  United  Nations  Charter.   By
         attacking  ISAF,  the  appellant  was  seeking  to  frustrate  that
         purpose.  To hold that his acts are in principle capable  of  being
         acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United  Nations
         accords with common sense and is correct in law."

68.  There then followed a reference to the judgment of Hogan J in the  High
    Court of Ireland in B v Refugee Appeals Tribunal and Others [2011] IEHC
    198 at [56].  Mr Jacobs rightly points out that Hogan J's  observations
    were obiter and that those  observations  were  in  proceedings  on  an
    application for leave to apply for judicial review.  Their approval  by
    our  Supreme  Court,  however,  nevertheless  gives  them  weight.   In
    particular, they usefully pinpoint the difference between (i) the  task
    facing a court or tribunal in a case such as the present; and (ii)  the
    task, such as that in LK (Sri Lanka) and B and D, where the  issue  was
    whether  persons  who  had  not   themselves   directly   carried   out
    exclusionary actions nevertheless fell to  be  excluded  by  reason  of
    membership or other involvement  in  an  organisation  which  did  (not
    exclusively) carry out such actions:-

         "55. I cannot conclude this judgment without  observing  that  this
             case also presents one unique  feature  which  would  seem  to
             distinguish it from the cases of Tamil, X, RS and B unt D.  As
             we have seen, in the  case  of  Afghanistan  the  UN  Security
             Council has resolved that the ISAF was the legitimate force to
             act in support of the Afghan government.  Of  course,  in  the
             present case the applicant has openly proclaimed not only  his
             opposition to the ISAF,  but  the  fact  that  he  engaged  in
             military combat with the ISAF.


         56.  In the light of this fact it will be difficult to see how  the
             applicant's own admitted conduct by openly engaging in  combat
             with  troops  whose  presence  in  Afghanistan  was  expressly
             sanctioned and authorised by UN Security  Council  resolutions
             was not  in  and  of  itself  contrary  to  the  purposes  and
             principles  of  the  United  Nations  within  the  meaning  of
             s.2(c)(iii) of the 1996 Act.  In this respect, it is different
             from B unt D where it was the fact  that  the  applicants  had
             participated in guerrilla warfare for terrorist  organisations
             [which] raised the question of whether their own  conduct  was
             contrary to the purposes and principles of the United  Nations
             by reason of, for example, their  complicity  in  war  crimes.
             This was precisely why an individualised assessment  of  their
             own personal knowledge and participation in such  conduct  was
             held to be necessary in that case by  the  Court  of  Justice.
             But if, as here, the applicant openly participates  in  combat
             operations against troops whose presence  has  expressly  been
             sanctioned by United  Nations  Security  Council  resolutions,
             this in and of  itself  would  seem  to  be  contrary  to  the
             purposes  and  principles  of   the   United   Nations,   thus
             disqualifying the applicant by  reason  of  the  operation  of
             s.2(c)(iii) of the 1996 Act."

69.  In the light of what we have said earlier, we are fully satisfied  that
    it is more likely than not (and in our view much more likely) that  the
    appellant in 2004 to 2006 engaged in combat against ISAF  forces,  both
    in a defensive and an offensive capacity.  We shall have  more  to  say
    about the nature of those acts when we come to deal with the  issue  of
    specificity.  We are,  however,  fully  satisfied  that  the  appellant
    willingly engaged in those actions, which involved the use of ordinance
    of the kinds described by the appellant to his Home Office interviewer.
     The appellant did so, not on an isolated occasion, but as part of  the
    ongoing Hizb-e-Islami conflict with  ISAF  and  the  Afghan  government
    forces during that time.

(ii) Seniority/role

70.  It is under this heading that the distinction articulated  by  Hogan  J
    in B becomes important in the present appeal.  In his oral and  written
    submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr Jacobs sought to  rely  upon
    passages in the judgment of  Stanley  Burnton  LJ  in  KJ  (Sri  Lanka)
    including, in particular, these:-

         "37. The application of Article 1F(c) will  be  straightforward  in
             the case of an active member of organisation that promotes its
             objects only by acts of terrorism. There will almost certainly
             be serious reasons for considering that he has been guilty  of
             acts contrary to the purposes and  principles  of  the  United
             Nations.


         38.  However, the LTTE, during the period when KJ was a member, was
             not such an organisation. It pursued  its  political  ends  in
             part by acts of terrorism  and  in  part  by  military  action
             directed against the armed forces of  the  government  of  Sri
             Lanka.   The   application   of   Article   1F(c)   is    less
             straightforward in such a case. A  person  may  join  such  an
             organisation, because he agrees with its political objectives,
             and be willing to participate in its military actions, but may
             not agree with and may not be willing to  participate  in  its
             terrorist  activities.  Of  course,  the  higher  up  in   the
             organisation a person is the more likely will be the inference
             that he agrees  with  and  promotes  all  of  its  activities,
             including its terrorism. But  it  seems  to  me  that  a  foot
             soldier in such an organisation, who has not  participated  in
             acts of terrorism, and in particular has not  participated  in
             the murder or attempted murder  of  civilians,  has  not  been
             guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of  the
             United Nations."


71.  Relying upon the approval which  KJ  (Sri  Lanka)  received  from  Lord
    Brown in JS (Sri Lanka), Mr Jacobs submitted:-

         "that the actions of the appellant, which were entirely military in
         nature (and did not involve acts of terrorism), cannot properly  be
         categorised as contrary to the purposes and principles  of  the  UN
         Charter so as to fall within the ambit of Article 1F(c).  The  fact
         that there was no UN presence in Sri Lanka does  not  detract  from
         the applicability of the principle in KJ (Sri Lanka) to the instant
         case."

72.  With respect to Mr Jacobs, this submission  is  misconceived.   If  the
    respondent in the present case had sought  to  ground  exclusion  under
    Article 1F on the basis of the  appellant's  activities  prior  to  the
    arrival on the scene of the UN-mandated ISAF force, the position  would
    have been quite different.  In that scenario, we  would,  indeed,  have
    had to engage in the kind of exercise with which the  Court  of  Appeal
    was concerned in KJ (Sri Lanka).   It  would  have  been  necessary  to
    analyse the range of activities undertaken by Jamiat and/or the Taliban
    during that time, and to determine, by  reference  to  the  appellant's
    position and activity in  those  organisations,  whether  it  could  be
    inferred that he agreed with and promoted  all  of  the  organisation's
    activities, including those actions described in Article 1F.

73.  But that is not necessary in the present case.  The Supreme  Court  has
    already held that  fighting  against  ISAF  is,  itself,  in  principle
    contrary to the principles and purposes of the United Nations.  That is
    not, of course, to say that an individualised assessment is not  called
    for in the present case.  On the contrary, this is precisely  the  task
    which both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court have set us.   The
    important point, however, is that the  analysis  called  for  in  cases
    turning  upon  the  issue  of  an  individual's  relationship  with  an
    organisation has  no  bearing  in  a  case  where  the  individual  has
    committed acts that are within the ambit of Article 1F(c).

74.  Accordingly, even if a person has  been  a  mere  "foot  soldier",  not
    commanding any other combatant and having no other significant role  in
    a military organisation fighting ISAF forces, he  would  not  for  that
    reason escape exclusion under Article 1F(c).  For example, such a  foot
    soldier may have willingly  and  frequently  planted  and/or  detonated
    IEDs, resulting in ISAF fatalities; or may  have  acted  as  a  sniper,
    targeting  ISAF  personnel.   In  either  case  it  would  frankly   be
    subversive of the 1951 Geneva  Convention  for  that  person  to  enjoy
    refugee status.  There is  nothing  in  the  relevant  case  law  which
    compels such a result.  By way of contrast, a proper application of the
    individualised assessment in  such  cases  could  result  in  a  person
    defeating an attempt to exclude by reference to  Article  1F(c)  where,
    for example, the evidence is that he took only a minimal part in combat
    on a single occasion, when he was  present  reluctantly,  through  some
    form of coercion.

75.  In cases such as the present, therefore, the issue of exclusion is  not
    necessarily answered by reference to  seniority  or  a  person's  place
    within a military command structure.  The key  questions  are,  rather:
    what did the person concerned do and why  did  he  do  it?   Everything
    depends on the facts.

76.  Anticipating to some degree our findings in  relation  to  specificity,
    we find that, in the circumstances of the present case, the  respondent
    has shown that there are serious reasons for considering the  appellant
    has committed acts contrary to  the  principles  and  purposes  of  the
    United Nations, not only because the evidence points overwhelmingly  to
    his having been personally and willingly involved in combat with  ISAF,
    but also (and in any event) because of his position as commander of ten
    to fifteen other  combatants,  who  were  fighting  ISAF  whenever  the
    occasion demanded.

77.  In so finding, we have borne in mind the Supreme  Court's  approval  in
    Al-Sirri and DD of what is stated in the UNHCR's Background Note on the
    application of the exclusion clause; namely, that Article 1F(c) should

        "be  construed  restrictively  and  its  application  reserved   for
        situations where an act and the consequences  thereof  meet  a  high
        threshold.  This threshold should be defined in terms of the gravity
        of the act in question, the manner in which the  act  is  organised,
        its  international  impact  and  long  term  objectives,   and   the
        implications for intentional peace and security".

78.  But it is crucial to bear in mind that,  in  following  this  approach,
    the Supreme Court found that fighting ISAF forces in Afghanistan at the
    relevant period did  in principle fall  within  the  scope  of  Article
    1F(c).  We  therefore  reject  the  appellant's  apparent  attempt,  as
    articulated by Mr Jacobs, to rely upon the UNHCR's comments as in  some
    way imposing a further discrete restriction  upon  the  application  of
    Article 1F(c) in the present case.  In particular, the comment at  [50]
    of the UNHCR Note that "it is generally understood that acts covered by
    Article 1F(c) can only be committed by persons holding  high  positions
    in a state or state-like entity" finds no endorsement in the  judgments
    of the Supreme Court in the case of the appellant.


  79.  However, if we are wrong in concluding that,  on  the  facts  of  the
    present case, no further findings about seniority are required, then we
    find as a fact that the appellant had a senior, significant  and  well-
    recognised position within Hizb-e-Islami in 2004-2006, as  demonstrated
    by the findings we have  made  regarding  his  relationship  with  both
    Hekmatayar and Kashmir Khan.   The  interview  record  shows  that  the
    appellant was well aware  that  the  policy  of  Hizb-e-Islami  at  the
    relevant time was to fight  against  both  the  Afghan  government  and
    international forces; not least, in order to  rid  Afghanistan  of  the
    presence of such "foreigners".


(iii) Specificity

80.  Mr Jacobs submitted that, since the  judgments  of  the  Supreme  Court
    were handed  down,  the  respondent  had  not  seen  fit  to  make  any
    investigations, whether with the British Embassy in Kabul or elsewhere,
    to try to identify precisely what acts  the  appellant  had  committed,
    whilst he was with Hizb-e-Islami.  Mr Jacobs drew attention to the last
    sentence of [147] of Immigration Judge Simpson's  determination,  where
    she accepted that "neither at interview  or  in  cross-examination  was
    there elicited any specificity about his actions or incidents".

81.  We agree with Mr Auburn that there is nothing in the relevant case  law
    or the UNHCR Note that requires the acts upon which  an  Article  1F(c)
    exclusion case is based to be pleaded with the degree of  particularity
    that one might find, say, in an indictment in the Crown Court.  This is
    not to say that vague assertions or  generalised  inferences  will  do.
    Thus, for example, an assertion that a man of military age living in an
    area of high Hizb-e-Islami activity at  the  relevant  time  should  be
    assumed on that account to have engaged in Article 1F(c)  activity  for
    that organisation, would clearly be problematic.  But, in  the  present
    case, there is abundant evidence in the interview with the appellant in
    April 2007, and in his statement of February  of  that  year,  to  show
    there are serious  grounds  for  considering  he  fought  against  ISAF
    forces, deploying against them artillery and other weapons, and that he
    had the command of ten to fifteen men who were  also  engaged  in  such
    combat.  We do not believe the appellant's claim that during  all  this
    time, he did not kill anybody or see anybody killed.   But  it  is  not
    necessary in law for the respondent to prove either of these things.

(iv) Probability

82.  We remind ourselves of what the Supreme Court held in Al-Sirri  and  DD
    ([8] above).  For the reasons we have  given,  we  reject  as  entirely
    incredible the appellant's latest  description  of  his  activities  in
    Afghanistan.  Applying  the  standard  set  out  Al-Sirri  and  DD,  we
    conclude that the respondent has amply shown there are serious  reasons
    for considering that the appellant has committed acts contrary  to  the
    principles and purposes of the United  Nations,  within  the  scope  of
    Article 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention, such that he is to  be  denied
    the status of a refugee.  The evidence relied upon by the respondent is
    "clear and credible" and "strong".  In  our  considered  judgment,  the
    requisite serious reasons exist.

Decision

83.  The appellant is not a refugee.  He is excluded from  the  1951  Geneva
    Convention by reason of Article 1F(c) thereof.

Anonymisation

84.  We make an order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the appellant.
