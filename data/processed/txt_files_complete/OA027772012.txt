                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State  from  a  decision  of
        Judge Mc Grade sitting in the First-tier Tribunal dated 4  February
        2013.  For the sake of convenience I will refer to  the  appellants
        before him (now the respondents) as the claimants.   The  claimants
        are the wife and minor child of a British citizen sponsor  resident
        in Scotland.   They  applied  to  join  the  sponsor  in  an  entry
        clearance application that was refused  on  9  January  2012.   Two
        points were taken  in  that  refusal  decision,  first  that  false
        statements had been made to support the application and accordingly
        that refusal was mandatory applying Paragraph 320 of  HC  395;  and
        second that in the light of all the information the Entry Clearance
        Officer was not satisfied of the ability of the sponsor to maintain
        claimants adequately without recourse to public funds.


     2. In the entry  clearance  application  dated  3  November  2011  the
        claimants  said  that  the  sponsor  was  employed  by  a   company
        identified as Killuminati Ltd of Glasgow and had been  so  employed
        since 13 April 2010.   The  application  stated  that  the  monthly
        income after tax was �650 but there were also supplementary sources
        of income by means of sponsorship by the sponsor's brother  in  the
        sum of �250 a month and a carers allowance paid to the  sponsor  in
        the sum of �55 per week to enable  him  to  care  for  his  mother.
        Various  documents  were  produced  to  support  these   statements
        including the sponsor's bank statements with the Bank  of  Scotland
        and a number of wage slips from Killuminati  Ltd  showing  a  gross
        monthly pay of �656 yielding a net pay of �650 after income tax and
        national insurance had been deducted.  There was also a P60 end  of
        year certificate for the Tax Year 2010 to April showing  gross  Pay
        was �8,111 and deductions of �324.

     3. The entry clearance officer made verification checks upon  earnings
        and on 7  December  2011  was  satisfied  to  a  higher  degree  of
        probability, that the result was adverse. The report reveals  that,
        "according to information provided by other Government  Departments
        the claimed employment is not as stated thus in the  light  of  the
        information provided by OGD the documents provided  in  support  of
        the claimed employment are considered not genuine."

     4. The claimants appealed and the matter came before Judge Mc Grade on
        4 February 2013. Unfortunately there was no representation  by  the
        Secretary of State at that appeal.  At this stage the  judge  heard
        from the sponsor who had produced a letter from the HMRC confirming
        that they  had  a  record  of  the  sponsor's  employment  for  the
        financial year ending 5 April 2012. The sponsor had understood that
        the reason why there was no record for the earlier year was because
        he did not earn sufficient income to pay tax although as the  judge
        pointed out the P60 was not consistent with that proposition.

     5. At paragraph 13 of his ruling the judge looked  at  three  possible
        explanations for the evidence. The first was that the HRMC had made
        a mistake in its records; the second that  the  sponsor  was  never
        employed in 2010 to 2011;  the  third  was  that   sponsor  was  in
        employment but

             "failed to remit the sums due  by  way  of  tax  and  national
             insurance  contributions  to  HMCR  but   produced   documents
             suggesting  that  tax  had  been  paid.   Whichever  of  these
             explanations  is   correct   it   must   follow   that   false
             representations by way of false information had been  made  in
             relation to the application."


     6. The judge went on to find that he accepted that the sponsor was  in
        employment at the material time and at  the  date  of  the  hearing
        before him and was  able  to  maintain  his  dependents  adequately
        without recourse to public funds. Notwithstanding his inability  to
        comply  with  the  rules  by  reason  of  the  finding   of   false
        documentation, he allowed the appeal on  the  basis  of  Article  8
        concluding  that  it  would  be  disproportionate  to  refuse   the
        claimant's  admission  to  the  United  Kingdom   to   join   their
        husband/father in all the circumstances of this case.

     7. The Secretary of State appealed against the Article 8 ruling of the
        judge submittting that the balance between public interest and  the
        interest of the claimants had not been properly  performed  in  the
        light of the primary findings.  Permission to appeal was granted by
        the First-tier Tribunal on 25 January 2013 and in  due  course  the
        matter was listed before me.


     8. On 5 June 2013, shortly before  the  hearing,  Mr  Shaoib  for  the
        claimants served a bundle of documents including  a  fresh  witness
        statement from the sponsor that explained that all the  information
        provided in support of the entry clearance application was accurate
        and that he had been issued with a P60 by his former accountant, Mr
        Javid, upon whom he relied to remit the monies to the  Revenue.  It
        should  be  pointed  out  that  the  sponsor  was  a  director   of
        Killuminaiti Ltd. The statement continued that he only became aware
        that the Revenue had had no communication with his company when  he
        received the refusal of the entry  clearance  application  and  the
        matter had been sorted out.

     9. There is also a letter from AS Accounting Services dated 25 January
        2012 with  some  supporting  evidence  stating  that  the  tax  and
        National Insurance contributions payable in respect of the  sponsor
        are now up to date.

    10. At the outset of the appeal I asked Mr Mullen to identify what  was
        the false document or representation upon which  the  Secretary  of
        State relies.  He referred me to the document  verification  report
        and the P60.  Mr Mullen indicated that he did not  wish  to  cross-
        examine the sponsor about his most recent  witness  statement  that
        explained how the document came  into  being  and  recognised  that
        following  the decision of the Court of Appeal in A v  Secretary of
        State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 773 6  July  2010  he
        would be in  difficulty  in  sustaining  the  submission  that  the
        claimant  and  the  sponsor   had   been   guilty   of   deliberate
        misrepresentation of the financial position so as  to  come  within
        the definition of false representations under the rules.

    11.   Mr Mullen further  accepted  that  in  the  light  of  the  other
        findings  of  the  judge,   if   there   were   indeed   no   false
        representations used in the entry clearance application,  then  the
        other requirements of the rules that satisfied and entry  clearance
        should have been granted.
    12.  In these circumstances I did not need to hear from  the  claimants
        and  indicated  that  the  claimants'  overall  appeal   had   been
        successful.  I now give reasons for that decision.

    13. In my  judgment,  Judge  Mc  Grade  erred  in  his  conclusions  in
        accepting  the  Entry   Clearance   Officer's   case   that   false
        representation had  been  used.   The  burden  of  proving  such  a
        contention falls on the party that alleges it,  in  this  case  the
        ECO.  The verification check report is summary in the  extreme  and
        unhelpful.  It does not state which document has been verified  and
        why it has been found to  be  false.  However,  in  substance,  the
        relevant document was P60  which  is   a  document  issued  by  the
        employer Killuminati Ltd to the  employee  stating  the  deductions
        that had been made from wages in the tax year ending the  5  April,
        2011.  I see nothing in any of the  material  upon  which  the  ECO
        relied to suggest that the P60 was false in  the  sense  of  either
        being forged or that it contained false information  in  the  sense
        that no deductions from wages had in  fact  been  made  during  the
        course of the year.

    14. What the inference from the initial enquiries with the  HMRC  would
        have indicated is that the employer had  not  paid  the  deductions
        over to the Revenue.  But there is no statement in the  certificate
        to the effect that payment had been made to the Revenue merely that
        the deductions had been made from the gross salary of the employee.
        As far as an employee is concerned that  is  the  information  upon
        which he needs to rely both when  completing  his  own  tax  return
        required to make one and to identify the level of his net  earnings
        in the context of immigration application.


    15. Accordingly, the judge's third hypothesis  in  this  case  did  not
        suffice to amount to finding of a false document. If there had been
        any false representation by the employer about the  tax  status  of
        their employee, a further inquiry  would  have  been  necessary  to
        establish whether the sponsor as both  employee  and  director  was
        aware of it. In any event, Mr Mullen is correct in accepting on the
        present state of the evidence that he could not establish that  the
        sponsor or the claimants were party to false representations within
        the meaning of the rule as clarified by the Court of Appeal in A  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department.


    16. In these circumstances I find there is an error of law by the judge
        in his assessment of the claim under the Immigration Rules.

    17.  I can well understand how a difficult issue would indeed arise  if
        the judge had found that the claimant and sponsor  were   party  to
        deliberate deception  to  misrepresent  earnings  but  nevertheless
        should be admitted applying Article 8 of  the  ECHR,  but  on  this
        analysis that issue does not arise in this case.

    18. The result is that I remake the Judge's decision  by  allowing  the
        appeal under the Immigration Rules, and setting aside the  decision
        in so far as it relates to Article 8 ECHR.  However, in substantive
        terms this means that  the  entry  clearance  officer's  appeal  is
        dismissed because any error made by the  judge  in  the  Article  8
        assessment would not have  been  material  or  dispositive  on  the
        appeal.

    19.  The sponsor confirmed that he is still in employment and  able  to
        support his wife and child without recourse to public funds  within
        the  meaning  of  Paragraph  281  of  HC395  that  is  to  say  the
        maintenance requirement of the rules  that  preceded  9  July  2012
        amendments.

    20. In those circumstances I remake the claimants' appeal  by  allowing
        it under the rules and directing that an entry clearance be  issued
        forthwith upon receipt of this determination to the parties.

    21.  It is unfortunate that a wife and a young  child  have  been  kept
        apart for the seventeen months that they have since the date of the
        decision in question.  With respect to the entry clearance officer,
        greater focus on which document was alleged to  be  false  and  why
        would undoubtedly have been of benefit to  all  concerned  in  this
        unfortunate appeal.
