                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the respondent to the original appeal,  against
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Fiona Beach), sitting at
    Taylor House on 28 September 2018, to allow a revocation of  protection
    appeal by a citizen of Kosovo, born 1972.

HISTORY

 2. The appellant came as a visitor in 1991, overstayed and in 1992 claimed
    asylum, which was granted in 1997,  followed  by  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in 1999. He has a long-standing partner, [VD], also from Kosovo,
    but now a British citizen, and they have twin  daughters,  V1  and  V2,
    born here on 27 May 2006. In 2002 the  appellant  himself  applied  for
    British citizenship, but failed to reply to Home Office  inquiries,  so
    was refused the following year.

 3. Between May and August 2014, the appellant and another man took part in
    a conspiracy to steal with persons unknown who were ordering electronic
    items over the Internet, for delivery on rounds where they were able to
    get the Royal Mail and Parcelforce delivery drivers  to  sign  for  the
    goods as if they had been delivered. Over �40,000 worth  of  them  were
    stolen, and, as the sentencing judge pointed out, a substantial  breach
    of trust  was  involved.  This  was  particularly  the  case  with  the
    appellant, who had begun as a courier driver himself, but by this  time
    ran a business, employing a number of others. In the judge's  view,  no
    real distinction could be made between  the  defendants'  position  and
    that of Royal Mail drivers, in terms of the absolute integrity required
    by their work.

 4. After a three-week trial  in  June  2016  the  appellant  and  his  co-
    defendant were found guilty, and on 6 July the appellant was  sentenced
    to 27 months' imprisonment, with slightly less for the other  man.  The
    judge noted the favourable things said about the  appellant,  including
    by a prosecution witness: he was very well-liked and hard-working,  and
    had built up his business from virtually nothing. However, he was doing
    well at it, and not in want of money, except  to  support  his  growing
    business. His had been a leading r�le in a conspiracy involving  breach
    of a high degree of trust, and sophisticated planning.

 5. This sentence was followed on 22 July 2016 by a notice of intention  to
    deport, to which the  appellant  replied  on  28  August.  Next,  on  5
    October, came notice of  the  Home  Office's  intention  to  apply  the
    presumption set out in s. 72 (2) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, allowing  for  his  expulsion  despite  the  grant  of
    asylum. On 16  August  2017  the  UNHCR  indicated  that  they  had  no
    objection to this course being taken, subject to a full examination  of
    the appellant's individual case, and on 28 October 2017  a  deportation
    order was signed, and sent with full reasons on the 30th.

APPEAL TO DATE

 6. The appellant did not pursue any protection claim, so there is no  need
    to discuss his conviction or its consequences any  further,  except  to
    say that, despite his good conduct while in prison, and since, there is
    clearly a strong  public  interest  in  his  removal,  as  Judge  Beach
    recognized. She referred to s. 117C of the 2002 Act, and in  particular
    to Exception 2, set out at (4). The appellant clearly  had  a  'genuine
    and subsisting relationship'  with  a  'qualifying  partner'  and  both
    'qualifying children': the question was  whether  the  effects  of  his
    deportation would be unduly harsh on them. It is  now  clear  that,  in
    both her case and theirs (see  RA  (s.117C:  "unduly  harsh";  offence:
    seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123 (IAC), referred  to  in  more  detail
    below), at paragraph 8:


         "As a result of KO (Nigeria), the position is that, in  determining
         whether Exception 2  (in  section  117C(5))  applies,  a  court  or
         tribunal is not to have regard to the seriousness  of  the  offence
         committed by the person who is liable to deportation."

 7. The judge found as follows:


         "76. it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's partner  to  stay
             here without him; but it would not be unduly harsh for her  to
             return to Kosovo with him;


         84.  it would be unduly harsh for the children to stay here without
             him; and


         87.  so would it be for them to go to Kosovo with him."

 8. Those findings were challenged by the Home  Office,  in  rather  prolix
    grounds (not drafted by Mr Lindsay), and permission to  appeal  granted
    by a first-tier judge, on the basis that  there  had  been  a  lack  of
    explanation as to why it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the  appellant's
    family to go to Kosovo with him: as just noted, this was not a  finding
    the judge had made in respect of his partner. This did not seem  to  me
    to be what the case was really about: the  children  are  both  British
    citizens, who have always lived here, and already at secondary  school.
    They are both of course entirely innocent parties, and, irrespective of
    what conditions might await them in Kosovo, it must now be unduly harsh
    to send them there.

 9. I made it clear to the parties at the first hearing on 7  January  that
    the real question in my view had been whether the judge was entitled on
    the evidence to find that it would  be  unduly  harsh  either  for  the
    children or their mother  to  stay  here  without  the  appellant.  Her
    decision had also been challenged on that point, as  not  supported  by
    the evidence. I considered this required reconsideration,  for  reasons
    which will shortly become clear; but, in fairness to the appellant  and
    the family as a whole, I also agreed to receive a psychological  report
    on the mother, when re-making the decision.  The  further  hearing  for
    that was adjourned on 26 February,  when  it  became  clear  that  this
    report would not be ready for 4 March, as promised, till  11  April.  I
    also made it clear that I should receive further oral evidence, limited
    to events since the first-tier hearing.

ERROR OF LAW

10. The appellant was sent to prison on 6 July 2016, and,  with  the  usual
    50% remission, served 13� months before  his  release  in  late  August
    2017. From then till the final hearing before me, he has been  at  home
    with his family for just over 18 months. At  paragraph  84,  the  judge
    concluded her reasons on the children's position, if he were sent  back
    to Kosovo, in this way, after accepting, on the basis of the  partner's
    own evidence and the report of an independent social worker,  that  she
    was 'emotionally fragile':


         "The appellant's partner could seek support from professionals  but
         an intervention by Social Services cannot be considered  to  be  in
         the children's best interests particularly at a time when they will
         be bewildered and upset by their father's deportation from the UK."

11. No doubt children who had a 'genuine and subsisting relationship'  with
    their father would inevitably be upset by his deportation; but  it  has
    to be said that  one  significant  reason  for  these  children  to  be
    especially bewildered by it must have been that their parents chose not
    to tell them anything about its being a possibility  till  just  before
    the independent social worker made her report. Of course this mistaken,
    if to some extent understandable decision cannot be  held  against  the
    children; but the independent social worker's report has to be read  in
    the light of the situation the parents had created.

12. The grounds of appeal referred to BL (Jamaica)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  357.
    There were a number of significant factual  differences,  including  BL
    having been sent to prison for four years; but  I  was  concerned  with
    extracting the relevant principles, rather than trying to match up  the
    facts. The common features with this case, which  led  to  the  passage
    relied on by Mr Lindsay before me were these:


      a)       the  appellant's  partner  and  children  were  all   British
         citizens;


      b)      she was said to have difficulty in looking after them  without
         him (in BL, because she drank more than was good for her), and  the
         Upper Tribunal inferred that they would descend  into  poverty  and
         require the support of the social services.

13. What the Court of Appeal said about that, at paragraph 53, was this:


         "As against this, however,  [the  partner]  had  looked  after  the
         family while BL was in prison or immigration detention and  the  UT
         had not made any findings that the family had then  descended  into
         poverty or required the support of social services, or that if that
         were to happen, there would not be adequate  support  services  for
         these children.  The UT were entitled to work on the basis that the
         social services would perform  their  duties  under  the  law  and,
         contrary to the submission of [counsel for the appellant],  the  UT
         was not bound in these circumstances to  regard  the  role  of  the
         social services as irrelevant."

14. While the judge reached a number of other findings on the evidence,  in
    my judgment her conclusion on this point had to depend on  her  finding
    at paragraph 84, set out at 10 above, which  showed  a  very  different
    approach from that prescribed by the Court of Appeal in  BL.  For  this
    reason, I took the view that her conclusion on the children's  position
    at 84 could not stand, and still less what she said about the effect on
    their mother of staying here without him at 76. This is why the judge's
    decision, detailed and comprehensive as it was, had to be re-made.

MORE LAW

15. Following the fresh hearing on 11 April, our attention was drawn to  RA
    (s.117C: "unduly harsh"; offence: seriousness)  Iraq  [2019]  UKUT  123
    (IAC), and we invited  submissions  on  it  by  e-mail.  Following  the
    passage already cited  at  6,  the  Tribunal  went  on  to  reject  the
    appellant's argument that MK (section 55  -  Tribunal  options)  [2015]
    UKUT 223 (IAC) prescribed any general approach to the facts,  in  cases
    such as this. At 17, once again summarizing the effect of KO, they said
    this:


         "... the test of "unduly harsh" has  a  dual  aspect.   It  is  not
         enough for the outcome to be "severe" or  "bleak".   Proper  effect
         must be given to the adverb "unduly".  The position is,  therefore,
         significantly far removed from the  test  of  "reasonableness",  as
         found in section 117B(6)(b)."

16. That is as far as we need go with RA, since the rest of the decision on
    the law is concerned with the interpretation of s. 117C (6), which  was
    not argued in  this  case,  where  the  appellant  must  succeed  under
    Exception 2, or not at all (until much later: see 54 - 55). It  follows
    from the  previous  citation  that,  having  noted  the  facts  of  the
    appellant's offence, and the factors in  his  favour  as  part  of  the
    background, we are no longer concerned with them, though we  should  be
    if this were a s. 117C (6) case. The effect of his deportation  on  his
    partner and children has to be considered solely in terms of whether it
    would be unduly harsh on them. This is a question for our judgment,  to
    be exercised in the light of the citation just  made,  and  no  further
    reference to the authorities is required.

FRESH HEARING: EVIDENCE

17. We heard evidence from both the appellant and his  partner  [VD]:  from
    now on we shall refer to her by her personal name only. Both also  made
    witness statements, as did the appellant's mother [N]  and  his  sister
    [I], who live together in this country. There is  a  report  about  the
    children by Sally-Anne Deacon CQSM, an 'independent social worker'  (20
    September 2018, with an addendum on 27 February), and one about [V]  by
    Dr Tracy King, a clinical psychologist  (2  April).  There  is  also  a
    report from [V]'s GP practice, containing one entry, for 16 July  2018.
    Apart from school reports on the children, those are the  main  sources
    of evidence before us.

18. The appellant   Most of his first statement is concerned with  his  own
    situation: we do not say that as a criticism, but to explain why we are
    not going into more detail on it. He describes how  [V],  the  children
    and his mother and sister all came to see him in prison three  times  a
    month, the most allowed; he also spoke to [V] and the  children  'every
    single day without a miss'.

19. The appellant and [V] hadn't discussed  his  real  situation  with  the
    children, as they felt they were too young, but simply told them he was
    going away to work in an institution and would be away for a long time.
    He accepted with hindsight that this might have been a mistake, and  in
    his oral evidence he also made clear that the children would have  seen
    posters and other signs on their visits, making it obvious to them what
    sort of a place he was in; but that had never been mentioned.

20. As for [V], the appellant thought she would be 'devastated' if he  were
    to be deported; he had heard she had been  taken  to  hospital  with  a
    panic attack  when  he  went  to  prison,  and  was  given  intravenous
    medication. She had found it very hard to cope without him, 'especially
    since they did not understand why I was not there for  them'.  She  had
    improved since his release,  but  was  'rather  fragile',  and  he  was
    worried how she would cope without him, or what he was earning.

21. In oral evidence, the appellant explained that he had had to guide  [V]
    with a number of things on visits and calls, such as how to  tax  their
    car. She had coped; but on the basis that this  was  only  a  temporary
    situation. She had hated being home alone, ever since she was young (we
    shall return to her early life in dealing with her evidence),  and,  if
    he wasn't there at night, would wedge chairs under their flat door  for
    security, which the children found rather funny.

22. The appellant said he had done his  best  to  help  the  children  with
    homework and school projects, and both he and [V] had  encouraged  them
    to value themselves as girls. Neither of them had ever smacked them, as
    parents tended to in Kosovo. Without his earnings, [V] wouldn't be able
    to afford extras, such as tai chi (though the  appellant's  sister  had
    paid for this while he was in prison)  or  after-school  activities  or
    trips, and wouldn't have the confidence to  drive  far  (if  she  could
    still afford to run their car at all). For the  present,  his  previous
    employers, who had given him a reference for his court case,  and  were
    clearly aware of his record and status, had  been  happy  to  have  him
    back, and even promoted him.

23. As for the family's situation if  the  appellant  had  to  go  back  to
    Kosovo, job prospects there weren't good: 65%  were  presently  out  of
    work. The appellant's work experience here had been in 'social care and
    transport logistics', neither of which existed there. If he did  get  a
    job, he gathered the average wage was E350 a month. (We may as well say
    right now that, while we have  no  doubt  that  an  enterprising  hard-
    working man like him could fend for himself in a country  he  knew,  if
    that were our concern, we do not regard it as at  all  likely  that  he
    would be able to send any significant amount of money back to help  his
    family).

24. While the appellant's only close relations (his mother and sister) were
    here, [V] had a sister, who lived in Kosovo,  though  she  was  also  a
    Canadian citizen. That had meant they could visit each other, and  they
    had done so probably about ten times over the 15  years  the  appellant
    and [V] had been together. On four or five of those occasions, [V]  had
    taken the children to Kosovo. Usually they  spent  five  or  six  weeks
    away, as [V] got the same long summer holidays as them:  the  appellant
    would join them for two or three, as and when he could  get  away  from
    work. Often they would go on trips (more cheaply arranged from  Kosovo)
    to the coast in Albania, or even to Turkey. They had last all  been  to
    Kosovo in 2014, and since he had been unable to  travel,  [V]'s  sister
    had been to see them here.

25. [V]       [V]'s first statement gives  considerable  detail  about  her
    family history. She was born in Kosovo in 1973, and when she  was  only
    nine months old, her father murdered her mother: she was lying  on  the
    bed next to her at the time, and was told what happened  later  by  her
    maternal grandmother. Her father suffered from schizophrenia, and spent
    the rest of his life in hospitals, till he died in about 2009. All  the
    children were first taken in by their paternal grandparents; but  later
    the grandparents found that too much for them, and [V]'s siblings  were
    sent to live with other relations.

26. [V]'s brother went to Spain when he was 18, and she has been  in  touch
    with him only once or twice a year, in brief  phone  calls,  since  she
    last saw him in about 2012. One sister (Sofie)  qualified  in  medicine
    before the war, and went to live with her husband in Canada, where they
    are citizens; but, as Sofie's qualifications were not recognized there,
    they went back to Kosovo later: he runs a  successful  business,  while
    she practises medicine. [V]'s other sister ([B]) came with her to  this
    country in 1998, and married a Spaniard. Unfortunately, after  [V]  met
    the appellant in 2005, relations between her and [B]  broke  down,  and
    they haven't been in touch at all for the last three years, even though
    they live quite nearby. This has also affected [V]'s relationship  with
    Sofie, though she does not explain to what extent.

27. [V] says the appellant was always a hands-on father,  and  would  feed,
    bathe and put their daughters to bed when they were small.  Since  then
    he has taken them for all kinds of activities, and shared fully in  the
    house-work. She says his love has made her very secure  and  confident,
    and would be devastated if she lost his company, though she would never
    lose his love.

28. The appellant's arrest had come as a complete surprise  to  [V],  while
    she was on holiday in Kosovo: he had been with her  and  the  children,
    but had returned the week before they were due to come back. She  found
    the investigation and trial process so  intensely  stressful  that  she
    couldn't even write down the  contact  details  for  him  when  he  was
    sentenced, and his solicitor had  to  do  it  for  her.  The  following
    morning she was having panic attacks, with breathing problems: she  got
    a friend to take the children to school, and went to  a  hospital   A&E
    department, where tablets failed to calm her down, so she was given  an
    intravenous injection, which enabled her to come home that night,  with
    the help of the appellant's sister [I] (Lili).

29. Afterwards [V] managed to cope, by reminding herself that the appellant
    would only be in prison for just over a year.  They  went  to  see  him
    regularly, and found him very emotional; the girls were not told he was
    in prison, but clearly suspected it. After they were told,  in  advance
    of their visit to Ms Deacon (the  'independent  social  worker'),  they
    broke down, and were crying all through their interview with her. Since
    then they have been less anxious, as for the  moment  their  father  is
    with them. [V] speaks highly of the  appellant's  attitude  to  others,
    polite to everyone, and generous, particularly to  drivers  who  worked
    for him. She was shocked  and  surprised  by  what  he  had  done,  but
    regarded it as very much out of character.

30. [V] says the appellant's mother [N] is old (now 74) and  has  too  many
    health problems of her own to help anyone else. His sister  Lili  works
    long hours, and has decided to remain single: she is very fond  of  the
    children, but hasn't got very much time to help with them; nor does she
    drive. The appellant's English is much better than  [V]'s,  so  he  has
    always been the one to help with homework, and go to parents' evenings.
    [We found the appellant's English extremely good, and [V]'s  more  than
    good enough to give evidence in; as should be  the  case  for  both  of
    them, given the length of time they have been in this country].

31. [V] says she is happy to take the children to Kosovo for holidays,  but
    not for them to grow up there, for reasons she gives, and which we have
    already accepted. She says she is finding it increasingly hard to  cope
    as the hearing date (for his first-tier  appeal)  draws  near,  and  is
    taking prescribed medication. The appellant was dishonest,  but  didn't
    think about the consequences to his family,  or  anyone  else,  at  the
    time; but seeing them suffer has been so distressing for  him  that  he
    would never offend again.

32. [V]'s second statement (6 February 2019) covers a good deal of the same
    ground again. She is finding it hard to sleep,  or  to  listen  to  her
    daughters when they want to tell her about their  day  at  school.  She
    doesn't feel she is doing her best at work, though no-one at her school
    has complained. She does  have  the  children  skills  which  might  be
    expected from a teaching assistant; but coping with her own  daughters'
    needs, in her present mental state, is another matter.

33. In her oral evidence, [V] said she hadn't been taking medication  again
    after her visit to the  A&E  till  last  summer,  when  the  first-tier
    hearing was coming up. She knew the appellant had received a notice  of
    intention to deport in July 2016; but she had been coping from month to
    month while he was in prison.

34. As for visits to Kosovo, the appellant had last come with  them  before
    his arrest in 2014: he used to come for part of their visit every year.
     In 2018 [V] and the children had been there for four or five weeks and
    stayed with her sister Sofie: her sister-in-law  Lili  had  paid  their
    fares, and the appellant, though he  couldn't  travel,  had  encouraged
    them to go, as had her GP. Lili and her mother lived not far  away,  in
    Gospel Oak, but, as previously mentioned,  were  unable  to  give  much
    help. The children were still going to their tai chi, and  had  started
    piano lessons just before the last New Year. They all saw Lili and  her
    mother on a Sunday; but she didn't feel up  to  having  the  children's
    friends to stay over.

35. [V]  provided  evidence  of  recent  appointments  with  Komal  Oza,  a
    'psychological wellbeing practitioner', with iCope, an NHS  service  to
    which she had been referred by her GP in February. Mr Oza says they had
    met once, and have five further sessions  planned:  [V]  was  suffering
    from low mood and anxiety, and he hoped to be able  to  give  her  some
    help and support; but he thought it likely that, owing to the  lack  of
    certainty around her and her family's future,  she  would  continue  to
    experience these symptoms.

36. [N] (the appellant's mother)   [N]  sets  out  the  family  history  in
    Kosovo, and how they came to make their way to this  country  in  1994.
    She is still suffering from her husband's death in 2010, after 44 years
    of marriage. Now she is nearly 75, with  'very  high  blood  pressure',
    dizziness and shoulder and knee pain. [I] lives  with  her,  and  looks
    after her, subject to work  pressure.  She  was  so  upset  during  the
    appellant's trial that her family had to send her  to  Kosovo  for  the
    duration, where she suffered from continuous chest pain. She  says  how
    dependent she is on  the  appellant's  help;  but  we  cannot  consider
    whether the effect of his deportation on her would be unduly harsh,  so
    this is more relevant to the question of what help she,  or  [I]  could
    give [V] with the children and things in general, if he had  to  leave.
    Of course she speaks highly of him, and of the children, and  expresses
    the fear that "... the whole family will descend into  some  darkness",
    if he had to go.

37. [I] (the appellant's sister)  [I] has  been  a  British  citizen  since
    2002: she gives more of the family history, and her own, including  her
    work record, and the breakdown of her marriage  in  this  country.  She
    received  her  psychotherapy  diploma  in  2008,  and  has  since  done
    voluntary counselling work for six years for one day a week. She  works
    for a beauty products company. [I] does  not  give  her  age,  but  was
    clearly a young grown-up when she first came here as an au pair in 1987
    - 89.  She  had  been  very  shocked  when  she  found  out  about  the
    appellant's crimes; but she says he is still visibly  sorry  for  them.
    Besides other visits, he always comes round to see her and their mother
    on a Sunday, which is their special family day, when they took care  to
    book prison visits.

38. On the question of what happened while the appellant was in prison, [I]
    says this (paragraph 23 of her statement)

       I managed to somehow support my brother's family while  [he]  was  in
       prison, but it was with the understanding that it  was  going  to  be
       only for the duration of his sentence. I  also  experienced  my  fair
       share of emotional turmoil trying to put on a  brave  face  while  at
       work and with my family. It was extremely  difficult  because  I  was
       constantly delaying my duties ... sometimes calling in sick just so I
       can stay at home to recover my energy or even just simply  by  crying
       to myself on my own.

39. [I] goes on to say that, much as she  loves  the  children,  she  would
    never be able fully to support them, emotionally or financially, as she
    doesn't earn enough, and sometimes has to travel for her work.  She  is
    afraid the responsibility in itself of taking her brother's place would
    be too much for her. [I] explains the effect of what  happened  on  her
    and her mother:

       As a result of [V]'s condition my mother  and  I  rallied  round  and
       helped every day the best way we could. It was not easy, because  all
       of us carried our own share of distress. We were in a constant  state
       of just surviving every day the best way we could.

    They hadn't known how to explain to the  girls,  then  only  ten,  that
    their father faced deportation.

40. Dr King (the clinical psychologist)        Dr King's very recent, long,
    discursive and somewhat repetitive report on  [V]  was  of  course  not
    before the judge. She gives her assessment of her as suffering from the
    following personality disorders:

       Dependent Personality Disorder    (over-reliance on  others  to  meet
       emotional  and  physical  needs,  hard  to  make  decisions   without
       excessive advice from others, passivity, fear of being left alone  to
       care for self, devastated by separation and loss and may go to  great
       lengths to stay in the relationship).

       Avoidant Personality Style        (extreme inhibition, inadequacy and
       sensitivity to negative criticism  and  loss  and  may  go  to  great
       lengths to stay in the relationship), and

       Schizoid  Personality  Style          (solitary   habits,   emotional
       distance difficulties expressing emotion)

41. Dr King's answers to the questions about  [V]  she  was  asked  by  the
    appellant's solicitors were as follows (mostly summarized by us):

      1. Is she suffering from any known psychological conditions that have
         affected her mental health due to past experiences?

         See  above,  also  Major  Depression   (recurrent,   severe)   and
         Generalized Anxiety disorder.

         Unusually dependent, self-effacing and  non-competitive;  lack  of
         initiative and general avoidance of autonomy;  vulnerable  without
         support and sensitive to criticism; intensely needy  of  affection
         and nurturing; destabilized by finding out at the crucial  age  of
         10 how she  had  come  to  lose  both  parents,  with  unconscious
         memories of the event itself 'stored physiologically in the body',
         reducing her mental resilience; exposed  to  the  war  in  Kosovo,
         'females  being  particularly  at  risk';   high   anxiety   level
         apparently 'suppressed to some degree with a functional  level  of
         depressive  symptomatology  to  reduce  the  connection  with  the
         emotion of fear; any loss likely to trigger her unprocessed trauma
         and her  early  isolated  life  as  a  child;  may  withdraw  from
         relationships if she fears rejection; lost older relations earlier
         than usual.

         Will try to appear calm, despite underlying fear; submits  to  the
         needs  and  fears  of   others   to   avoid   rejection;   "simple
         responsibilities may then demand more energy than she can  muster;
         may feel life as empty, but draining, with weariness  and  apathy;
         may withdraw, depriving herself of support; fearful of humiliation
         and exclusion; shy, apprehensive  and  awkward;  sees  herself  as
         "weak, fragile and inadequate and believes she is unable  to  meet
         everyday tasks without help", minimal  self-confidence,  and  puts
         herself down in the hope of reassurance.

         Disorientation and despondency indicate major depressive disorder;
         sensitive to ridicule and 'worries that she worries',  giving  the
         appearance of generalized personality disorder; daily apprehensive
         and short of sleep, tired, with aches and pains; restless,  unable
         to concentrate, easily distracted and apt to fear the worst.

      2. If so, are these long-term and do they require sustained long-term
         treatment?

         Long-term treatment for at least two years required;  at  risk  of
         frequent mental health instability till stabilized; even  then  at
         risk of relapses, owing to her age and  the  state  to  which  her
         mental health has  got.  Medication  likely  to  help,  but  anti-
         depressants will only manage some symptoms; needs personal therapy
         to build up her self-confidence and reduce  her  anxiety  and  low
         mood.

         Needs different approaches, such as Schema Focused Therapy and Eye
         Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing, less likely to be available
         on the NHS, and likely to cost about �100 a session for two years;
         current counselling will support her during that  time,  but  will
         not deal with her underlying problems.

      3. Are these conditions likely to affect her  day-to-day  functioning
         and activities, such as ability to continue employment, study  and
         running  of  the  household  and  most  importantly  care  of  her
         daughters who are about to enter their teenage years and puberty?

         She will have difficulties in empathizing with and in  setting  in
         context her daughters' concerns  at  their  crucial  age;  at  the
         moment her employer can cope with her having 'bad days'; but  this
         may not last, especially as she  is  working  with  special  needs
         children, so she might lose her  job;  in  view  of  her  father's
         reported schizophrenia, she might be at  risk  of  genetic  mental
         health trouble over time.

         She has a  good  relationship  with  the  appellant's  mother  and
         sister; but [N] needs support herself, and  [I]  can't  help  with
         long-term support. This might mean her  mental  health  got  worse
         fast, and expose the children to neglect and isolation, for  which
         she would be unlikely to seek help.

      4. In  your  opinion,  how  would  the  deportation  of  her  husband
         exacerbate the psychological difficulties that she is experiencing
         today?

         Her dependent nature, there since her  childhood  experiences,  is
         focused on the appellant, and would last for at least  two  years,
         at a crucial age for the children,  when  they  would  effectively
         lose both parents, one to deportation, and  the  other  to  mental
         health troubles. Deportation would be worse than when he  went  to
         prison, as it would be indefinite. She couldn't see  or  speak  to
         him so often, owing to the cost and safety concerns for women (and
         particularly the girls) in Kosovo. "Prison was also a loss of  his
         presence for her and  a  deterioration  in  her  presentation  was
         evident" [It  is  not  clear  how  Dr  King  is  able  to  give  a
         professional opinion about this, on the basis of her  very  recent
         knowledge of [V]].

      5. Explain or  comment  on  her  current  difficulties  that  she  is
         experiencing since her partner's appeal was won, and then when the
         Home Office  appealed,  and  the  whole  situation  regarding  the
         deportation has returned to square one.

         The situation for [V] is very difficult, as she was  confident  it
         had been put  right,  but  then  returned  to  the  original  very
         frightening situation. "This feeds into her sense  of  instability
         and lack of control and  reinforces  her  sense  of  helplessness.
         These will create physiological responses in  the  body  that  are
         likely to directly  trigger  her  early  infant  trauma  of  being
         present at her mother's murder and her  teenage  trauma  of  being
         exposed to war in Kosovo. The deterioration evident  is  explained
         in prior  questions  with  regard  to  her  overall  psychological
         formulation"

42. Ms Deacon (the 'independent social worker'  naturally  covers  a  great
    deal within Dr King's expertise, and also covered by her; so  we  shall
    try to  summarize  her  reports  only  so  far  as  they  add  anything
    significant. They do not contain any summary of  her  conclusions,  and
    reference to them is not helped by the lack of numbered paragraphs.  We
    have already dismissed the possibility of the girls' having to move  to
    Kosovo, so that part of Ms Deacon's evidence need  not  be  considered.
    Clearly if they are to stay here without the appellant, then they  must
    have their mother to look after them; so the question for us is whether
    it would be unduly harsh for them or her to have to stay  here  without
    him.

43. While it is clear from Ms Deacon's report that the appellant is a  very
    good father, very close to the girls, and a  provider,  it  is  equally
    clear that [V] has "highly skilled levels of parenting", as  Ms  Deacon
    puts it. Both girls are doing very well at  school  (as  their  reports
    show; and both were described as 'exceptionally gifted' to Ms Deacon by
    the head of their year) and equally well in their personal lives, as Ms
    Deacon's report makes clear at p 17.

44. So far as the direct effect on the girls of being without their  father
    is concerned, Ms Deacon says this in her first report, at p 16

       It is also argued that the girls could maintain  contact  with  their
       father  through  regular  visits  to  Kosovo  and  modern  means   of
       communication. However I feel that these  methods  are  significantly
       inadequate and impracticable given  [their]  familiarity  with  their
       father's physical presence, the positive nature of  their  attachment
       and the family's anticipated lack of financial resources

    Ms Deacon had already given the basis for this conclusion,  so  far  as
    the girls' attachment to the appellant was concerned, and on that basis
    it can easily be accepted that keeping in touch at a distance,  and  on
    visits, would be very much less satisfactory for both them and him.

45. At p 7, Ms Deacon quotes [I], who (she says) is a qualified  child  and
    adolescent psychotherapist, as saying  that  the  appellant's  time  in
    prison was

        ... devastating for the children,  but  manageable  with  everyone's
        support because it was short term and the girls  were  able  to  see
        their dad regularly. If this happens again it will  be  forever  and
        the levels of abandonment that the girls would  feel  would  have  a
        significant effect  on  the  future  for  them  in  terms  of  their
        identity, their mental health and  their  ability  to  fulfil  their
        potential.

    We do not of course take this by way of professional expertise  on  the
    part of [I], talking about close members of her own family.

46. Given the effect of KO, as set out in RA (see our 15), we take the view
    that the main question for us is not whether  [V]  could  keep  up  the
    present standards of care  for  the  girls  on  her  own,  without  the
    appellant's emotional, practical and financial support; but whether her
    ability to do so, without him, would collapse to the point of its being
    unduly harsh to her, or, even more importantly, them,  for  him  to  be
    removed. The answer mainly depends on Dr King's evidence; but we  shall
    look at Ms Deacon's to see what help she can give on it.

47. Ms Deacon gives  her  opinion  (at  p  16),  disclaiming  any  specific
    professional expertise in this area, that the  appellant's  deportation
    would appear likely to  result  in  "a  protracted,  if  not  permanent
    decline in [V]'s mental health,  which  is  likely  to  compromise  her
    current highly skilled levels of parenting".

48. The evidence Ms Deacon relates in her first report, which is capable of
    supporting that conclusion, is  already  available  to  us  from  other
    witnesses: for example, at p 9, the appellant's about her jamming their
    flat door with chairs if he is not there, and [I]'s about  her  lacking
    resilience and having 'fallen apart' while the appellant was in prison,
    and needing to be hospitalized. As we know from her own  evidence  (see
    28), this did not last long.

49. In Ms Deacon's second report, she  deals  with  the  case  under  three
    headings, which do not entirely reflect the contents of  what  follows.
    Her first point (1) consists in a return  to  what  happened  when  the
    appellant went to prison; then she goes on to consider  the  effect  on
    the  girls  themselves  of  having  to  do  without  their  father.  In
    considering the 'extreme and understandable distress' they  had  shown,
    we shall need to consider, as she does not, the effect of the  way  the
    news of its possibility had been broken to them: see 29.  That  is  the
    context for our consideration of what she goes on  to  say  about  them
    experiencing their father's  permanent  absence  "as  tantamount  to  a
    parental death".

50. At 2, Ms Deacon again draws the distinction between the effect  on  [V]
    of the appellant's permanent absence,  as  compared  to  his  temporary
    absence in prison, and returns to the quality of contact that could  be
    kept up between him, her and the children, for example by  Skype,  from
    Kosovo. She expresses  the  view  that  [V]'s  'anticipated  heightened
    levels of anxiety' would force her  to  terminate  her  employment,  in
    which case regular visits there would be beyond her means.

51. At 3, Ms Deacon makes the point  that  teenagers  do  better  with  the
    support of their parents, and may take to drink, drugs or  other  vices
    if allowed to go astray. She notes these  girls'  high  performance  at
    school, and ambitions for their future lives, and repeats the view that
    the appellant's absence in itself would have  "...  potential  to  have
    catastrophic implications for the girls' futures",  especially  if  [V]
    became 'unwell' without him.

52. At 4, Ms Deacon notes the availability of social care;  but  she  takes
    the view that this would be unlikely to be offered on a long-term basis
    as a protection need for the children, as they have an extended  family
    who could take responsibility. This is slightly at odds with [V]'s  own
    evidence about [I]'s commitments and [N]'s lack of capacity. Ms  Deacon
    goes on  to  note  the  availability  of  voluntary  support;  but  she
    concludes that this would be unlikely to be offered more  than  once  a
    week, which would not be adequate. She  has  not  informed  herself  on
    [V]'s take-up of mental health support; but  again  she  speaks  of  "a
    significant delay in assessing  this  resource",  owing  to  nationwide
    demands.

53. GP report       This relates to what is described as a first depressive
    episode, which [V] came in with on 16  July  2018.  By  this  time  the
    appellant would have been out of prison for  nearly  a  year,  and  was
    awaiting his first-tier appeal hearing on 28 September. Her history  is
    given as ''depression with low  mood,  lack  concentration,  difficulty
    focusing, poor sleep'': the context is  given,  and  the  only  further
    potentially significant point is ''prev[ious]  depression  around  time
    girls born, again, never self harm thoughts then either. Case due to be
    heard in September''.

54. [V] was prescribed the well-known anti-depressant Citalopram,  and  was
    to be reviewed in two or three weeks. It was noted  "can  self  ref[er]
    psychology at any stage": no doubt this was advice which had been given
    her at the time. There is then a final entry 'crisis plans': presumably
    this also referred to advice, but no further details are given.

55. There is no evidence from the GP about  any  further  appointments,  or
    prescriptions; and no evidence of any reference by [V] or  anyone  else
    to a psychologist, until this was  finally  done  in  response  to  the
    application made by the appellant's then counsel, on the basis of which
    I adjourned the hearing to 4 March, and then 11 April. (I was a  little
    put out to see that Dr King dates her instructions only from  9  March;
    but Miss Harvey succeeded in reassuring me that something at least  had
    been done before that).  That  concludes  our  treatment  of  the  main
    sources of evidence, as listed at 17, so  we  shall  now  turn  to  the
    argument.

DISCUSSION

56. Both advocates made oral submissions at  the  hearing,  and  others  in
    writing, in Miss Harvey's case by  e-mail,  in  response  to  the  late
    submission of RA by Mr Melvin.  Since  these  dealt  with  her  general
    argument, it is convenient to take  that  first.  Besides  the  'unduly
    harsh' point, extensively discussed at the hearing, Miss Harvey  relies
    on the 'very compelling circumstances' exception under s. 117C (6),  on
    the basis that the appellant

       ... has lived lawfully in the UK for some 28 years, since 1 September
       1992 and was recognised as a refugee from the  war  in  Kosovo.   The
       very long length of his residence and that, as a  refugee,  for  many
       years the UK was the  only  country  that  he  could  call  home  are
       factors, taken cumulatively with those that  bring  the  case  within
       Exception 2, constitute very compelling circumstances.

57. That is not an argument we  can  accept:  if  we  had  regarded  it  as
    arguable, then we should either have had to  re-open  the  case  for  a
    third hearing, or else invite Mr Melvin to reply  by  e-mail.  However,
    while the 'very compelling circumstances' exception is open in a medium-
    sentence case, as made clear in NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662, this
    case was argued throughout before us, with good reason,  on  the  basis
    that this appellant must succeed, if at all, under Exception 2.

58. The version of the 'very compelling circumstances' argument put forward
    in Miss Harvey's e-mail here  is  'over  and  above'  Exception  1,  if
    anything. Exception 1 was not argued before us, or  at  the  first-tier
    hearing, for the good reason that this appellant, born on  28  December
    1972, was already 28 years  8  months  old  when  he  arrived  in  this
    country, on 31 August 1991, and, following that, had spent only another
    26 years and (nearly) 2 months here by the date of the  decision  under
    appeal on 30 October 2017, so had not been here for 'most of his life'.



59. The 'very compelling circumstances' argument is  one  which  will  only
    become relevant if the appellant fails on the 'unduly harsh' point: see
    NA (Pakistan) at paragraph 36. Besides that, it is quite clear from the
    appellant's own evidence that he has quite happily taken his family  on
    holiday to Kosovo and nearby countries a  number  of  times  over  more
    recent years, and is by no means a person whose only possible  home  is
    here now. Dealing with the present situation  as  we  must,  the  'very
    compelling circumstances' argument is one which could not in  any  case
    succeed on its merits.

60. The other additional point of law taken in Miss Harvey's e-mail is  her
    reliance, in rather  general  terms,  on  the  continuing  validity  of
    Strasburg jurisprudence on article 8. While no doubt she  is  right  in
    principle on that, we were not in any case proposing to take any notice
    of the Home Office circular relied on by Mr Melvin,  but  to  base  our
    decision squarely  on  the  'unduly  harsh'  point,  as  laid  down  by
    Parliament, definitively defined in KO,  explained  in  RA  and  argued
    before us.

61. As already explained at 16, there is no need to  go  further  into  the
    authorities in this case: there is one question, for us  to  answer  in
    what is described in MK as an exercise of 'evaluative judgment'.  Would
    the consequences of the appellant's removal be unduly harsh, either for
    his children (directly or because of the effect on their mother), on on
    [V]?

62. Dealing first with the direct consequences, we entirely accept that

      a)       both  the  girls  and  [V]  are  particularly  close  to  the
         appellant; in [V]'s case, perhaps  all  the  more  because  of  the
         continuing effects of her grisly early history (see 25);

      b)      remote contact with him (by  Skype  or  the  like)  could  not
         replace face-to-face, especially for girls of that age; and

      c)      they would all have a considerably lower  standard  of  living
         without his income;  the only  direct  relevance  of  this  to  the
         'unduly harsh' criterion is that it would make it harder  for  them
         to go and see him in Kosovo.

63. We do not accept that such visits would be completely  impossible:  [I]
    could no doubt give some help  in  finding  the  money  for  occasional
    tickets for the cheap flights which are on offer  to  Kosovo,  as  with
    many eastern European destinations, even if she is unable  to  take  on
    any regular or continuing  responsibility.  Once  there,  [V]'s  sister
    Sofie certainly could, and there is reason to suppose, given  her  past
    hospitality, would help with arrangements.

64. The result is that,  though  the  direct  effects  of  the  appellant's
    removal on the girls remain something  to  be  borne  in  mind  on  the
    'unduly harsh' question as a whole, they cannot answer it in his favour
    on their own. The same would apply to the direct  effects  on  [V],  if
    they went no further than missing his practical, financial or emotional
    support. Sadly, as made clear in KO and a number of previous decisions,
    missing a father or a partner, even very much indeed, may be harsh, but
    is  a  normal,  rather  than  an  unduly  harsh  consequence   of   his
    deportation.

65. In our view the key to this case is whether  the  consequences  of  the
    appellant's deportation would go so far as to include what in  ordinary
    language we should call a complete breakdown on  [V]'s  part.  If  they
    did, we should be prepared to accept that they would indeed  be  unduly
    harsh for her, and, because of their effect on her, for the girls;  but
    not otherwise. Simply not being able to look after them as well as  she
    does now would not be enough to make it unduly harsh  for  them.  While
    that state of affairs would no doubt be extremely worrying for [V],  we
    do not think that could be described as unduly harsh for  her,  unless,
    once again, it led to a complete breakdown.

CONCLUSIONS

66. As we have already made clear, the crucial evidence on this point is Dr
    King's: from her 4.1, she had exactly the same sources  of  information
    as we do, with a three-hour interview with [V] taking the place of  the
    oral evidence we heard from her. While we  do  not  doubt  the  general
    validity of Dr King's conclusions at 1 and 2 (see  our  41),  the  most
    relevant questions for our purposes are 3 and 4.

67. Bearing in mind that Dr King's first-hand knowledge of [V] is  so  very
    recent (from their interview less than a  month  before  the  hearing),
    some  detailed  consideration  of  her  recent  history   was   clearly
    important. Dr King lists the GP report among her sources, and we should
    have expected some discussion at 3 of whether or not there had been any
    further visits to the surgery, or attempts to seek their help, or  that
    of the NHS psychology service; and, if not, why not.

68. We do not doubt that [V] was genuinely anxious  about  the  appellant's
    future when she saw the GP last July. It was clearly  significant  that
    she did so, and on the evidence before us only did so, when the  first-
    tier hearing was approaching. The question is whether [V] went  to  see
    her GP because the uncertainty involved in that prospect had  made  her
    notably more anxious than she had been before; or because  she  wanted,
    or had been told, to get further evidence for the hearing?

69. Similarly there was no attempt to get any  further  psychological  help
    for [V] till after the Home Office appeal first came  before  me  on  7
    January,  and  Dr  King's  involvement  was   forensic,   rather   than
    therapeutic. Only in February (see 35) did [V] get referred by  her  GP
    to Mr Oza, and any help he had been able to give  her  was  at  a  very
    early stage, though he was not optimistic about the results. We have no
    evidence as to how the referral  to  Mr  Oza  came  about,  though  the
    involvement of Dr King was  clearly  on  legal  advice,  following  the
    adjournment in January.

70. We do bear in mind what both Dr King and  Ms  Deacon  say  about  [V]'s
    reluctance to seek help, and we certainly do not regard the  fact  that
    she only did so on  the  occasions  just  mentioned  as  fatal  to  the
    contention that she would break down without the appellant, failing the
    two years or more of weekly treatment recommended by Dr King  under  2.
    We regard her as an entirely genuine witness, and we have no doubt that
    her visit to her GP when the first-tier  hearing  was  approaching  was
    brought about by genuinely increased anxiety on her part.

71. What the lack of any other previous attempts to seek  help  does  mean,
    however, is that [V]'s likely response to being without  the  appellant
    has to be tested, so far as practical, rather  than  theoretical  facts
    are concerned, to a very large extent on what happened while he was  in
    prison between 1 July 2016 and late August 2017.

72. Under 4, Dr King says this about [V] being without the appellant then

       Prison was also a loss of his presence for her and a deterioration in
       her presentation was evident. However she could see  him  weekly  and
       have daily telephone contact with him for support. There was also  an
       end in sight for them to reunite. She therefore will not have felt so
       helpless or out of control as she does now.

73. The last three sentences of that passage make perfectly good sense, and
    indeed correspond with findings we should have been  prepared  to  make
    for ourselves on the evidence before us, including [V]'s live evidence,
    and rather anxious appearance as she gave it. However the  language  of
    the first ('presentation') tends to suggest a professional  observation
    by the user,  which  of  course  was  something  Dr  King  had  had  no
    opportunity of while the appellant was in prison.

74. There is a similar lack of investigation of [V]'s recent  history  (see
    52) on the part of Ms Deacon, so far as she is  qualified  to  give  an
    opinion on the  point  we  are  considering;  and  she  refers  to  her
    'hospitalisation' at 48 without making it clear that it had  only  been
    temporary. Of course we bear in mind that  the  intravenous  medication
    [V] was given when she took herself in to the A&E department had been a
    rather drastic intervention, and, in view of her failure to respond  to
    the tablets she was given, no doubt a necessary one.

75. However, [V] had been able to cope after that, though again we bear  in
    mind that she was able to speak to the appellant every day, and see him
    every week. In the process she had to be talked through  such  ordinary
    details of organizing one's own life as how to  set  about  taxing  the
    family car,  to  which  she  has  now  been  introduced.  Although  the
    appellant refers to the anxiety (irrational in this country) which  [V]
    had shown by jamming the front door with chairs every night when he was
    away, this now dates back nearly two years. More recently, she had felt
    able to leave the appellant at home  here  last  summer  and  take  the
    children to Kosovo for four or five weeks, though with the help of [I],
    who had paid for their trip, and they stayed with [V]'s sister Sofie.

76. It is quite true that the girls, both 13, are now at a crucial stage in
    their lives, and that remains a relevant factor, though it does not  in
    itself require their father's appeal to be allowed (as  made  clear  by
    the Tribunal in RA, in their treatment of MK). The  other  self-evident
    truth about them is that they will be growing up fast: as time goes on,
    they will need less support from their mother, and be able to give  her
    more themselves.

77. On that basis, the crucial  period  for  the  girls  will  last  for  a
    relatively short time after the appellant has to leave,  if  eventually
    that does happen. While [N] is unlikely, in view of her health,  to  be
    able  to  give  any  practical  support,  a  grandmother's  wisdom  and
    experience can itself be valuable. Though [I] disclaims any ability  to
    commit herself to long-term support, she  has,  to  her  credit,  shown
    herself ready and willing to make a valuable contribution by paying for
    [V]'s trip to Kosovo with the girls last summer.

78. Neither Dr King nor Ms Deacon deals with this point: 13-year olds,  and
    particularly girls are growing up fast, and the need  for  support  for
    them and their mother cannot be  assessed  as  if  the  situation  were
    static. We bear in mind what Dr King says under 2 (see  our  41)  about
    [V]'s need for long-term help, and the limited value  of  what  can  be
    done in the short term; and also Ms Deacon's  views  at  52  about  the
    limited scope of help available from public sources.

79. However, on the basis that the crucial period for the girls  is  likely
    to last for a limited time, [V] and the girls can all get  useful  help
    from [I], and [V] should be able to cope with such short-term  help  as
    she can get from her GP, social services, or the NHS psychology service
    (as she did without any of that, though with much  greater  opportunity
    for contact with the appellant, while he was in prison).

80. That does not entirely deal with [V]'s own position, as  she  would  no
    doubt still miss the appellant very badly, even  after  the  girls  had
    adapted to his departure. However, once she had got through the crucial
    period for them, we think she should be able to stay here with them for
    as long as they need her to look after them: while that may be for more
    than five years, it is likely to be less than the  ten  for  which  the
    appellant himself would be excluded, following deportation.

81. We think the judge was right not to regard  joining  the  appellant  in
    Kosovo as unduly harsh for [V],  for  her  own  sake  rather  than  the
    girls'. Once they no longer needed her living  with  them  and  looking
    after them, [V]  would  have  the  choice  whether  to  wait  till  the
    appellant could eventually rejoin her here (which we see no reason  why
    he should not, once ten years have passed); or to rejoin him in Kosovo.
    That would give [V] at least something other than permanent  separation
    from the appellant to look forward to, and  so  we  cannot  regard  the
    consequences of his removal as unduly harsh for her, for her own  sake,
    either.

82. On that basis, though the consequences of the appellant's having to  go
    will certainly be harsh for the whole family, we cannot, on the law  as
    declared in KO, regard them as unduly harsh, either for [V] or for  the
    girls. That is the starting-point for our consideration of  article  8,
    and we have not been  referred  to  any  specific  Strasburg  or  other
    jurisprudence or legislation  which  might  make  it  inapplicable,  or
    modify it in this case.

83. The result is that the Home Office appeal must  be  allowed.  We  reach
    this conclusion with complete lack of enthusiasm: [V] and the girls are
    all British citizens, leading hard-working lives  and,  in  the  girls'
    cases, potentially valuable ones to society outside their  own  family.
    They are all innocent parties, and the consequences  for  all  of  them
    will be harsh. RA makes it clear that the appellant is not entitled  to
    rely on the result of the individual case in  MK,  as  opposed  to  the
    principles set out in it, endorsed in KO;  but  we  do  note  that  the
    children in MK were only seven, so would go on  requiring  support  for
    very much longer than in this case.

84. Even the appellant, not that his interests are for us to consider,  has
    always been a hard-working man, and, apart from  becoming  involved  in
    crime, an excellent father and partner. He was an engaging witness, and
    we have no doubt he genuinely regrets his past dishonesty, if only  for
    the harsh effects it has had, and may now go on having for his  family.
    If we had had to consider only the proportionality of  his  removal  to
    the public interest in the prevention of crime, without looking  at  it
    through the 'unduly harsh' test, then we might have reached a different
    result; but that is not the case.
