Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India born in 1988.  He appealed  against
    a decision of the Secretary of State made on 11 July 2013 to refuse  to
    vary leave to remain.  Also, to remove by way of directions  under  s47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The history is that the Appellant entered the UK on  14  February  2011
    with entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  He was given leave
    to enter until 30 November 2012.  On  that  date  he  made  a  combined
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant
    under the points-based system and for a Biometric Residence Permit.

 3. In refusing the application the Respondent noted that the Appellant had
    claimed 30 points under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules for a valid
    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies  (CAS)  assigned  by  St  John's
    College Ltd.  However, the Respondent was not satisfied that he  had  a
    valid CAS because the Tier 4 Sponsor Register was checked but St John's
    College Ltd was not listed, its  licence  having  been  revoked  on  19
    February 2013 which meant that the CAS submitted was no  longer  valid.
    The Appellant had been written to on 17 April 2013 and informed of  the
    revocation and that his CAS was no longer valid.

 4. He was given 60 days to withdraw his application  and  submit  a  fresh
    application in a different category, leave the UK, or obtain a new Tier
    4 Sponsor.  Nothing was received from the Appellant.

 5. Having failed to provide a valid CAS the Respondent was  not  satisfied
    that the Appellant had  met the requirements  of  paragraph  245ZX  and
    Appendix A and C of the Rules.

 6. He appealed. In the Grounds of Appeal the Appellant said that following
    the  revocation  of  the  St  John's  College  licence  he  joined  the
    Postgraduate Diploma Hospitality and Tourism Management (NVQ  Level  7)
    at Docklands College, Peckham, London.  He  sent  the  CAS  letter  and
    other documents to UKBA on 29 June 2013.  Although  the   deadline  for
    receipt  was  30  June  2013,  the  documents  were  delivered  to  the
    Respondent on 1 July 2013.   The  Respondent  failed  to  look  at  the
    original CAS issued by Docklands College.  At the date of decision  the
    CAS from  the  new  Sponsor  had  reached  UKBA.   The  Appellant  thus
    satisfied paragraph 245ZX(c) and (d).

 7.   The case was decided, at the Appellant's request  without  a  hearing
    'on papers', in a determination promulgated by 10 January 2014 by Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Cheales.

 8. In a brief determination the judge stated:

         '4.  The Appellant was notified in a letter of 13 April  2013  that
             he had 60 days ending on 30 June 2012 to obtain a new CAS  for
             a course of study with a fully  licensed  Tier  4  educational
             Sponsor.  I do not have the CAS before me but attached to  the
             bundle is a conditional letter from Docklands College dated 28
             June 2013.  The Appellant sent this letter  on  29  June  2013
             which was a Saturday.  The document was therefore delivered on
             the Monday.  Even if the Appellant had a valid CAS, he did not
             serve it within the relevant time.  This part of the appeal is
             dismissed.'



 9. The judge went on to allow the appeal  against  removal  under  s47  as
    being not in accordance with the law.

10. He sought permission to appeal which was  granted  by  a  judge  on  31
    January 2014 who stated:

         '2.  The grounds before the  judge  contended  that  the  Appellant
             applied for an extension under Tier 4  on  29  November  2012.
             The  TOEIC  certificate  dated  13  November  2013  which  was
             produced as part of the  extension  showed  that  he  met  the
             English requirements.  His college's licence was then revoked.
              He received a 60 day period ending 30 June 2013 to  submit  a
             valid CAS.  He sent the "new" CAS to the UKBA on 29 June  2013
             through the Royal  Mail  Special  Delivery  and  enclosed  the
             receipt.  The receipt showed  that  it  was  received  by  the
             Respondent  on  1  July  2013.   The  CAS  should  have   been
             considered as unconditional.

          3.  It is arguable that a valid CAS was served within the relevant
             time, as it was posted prior to 30 June 2013.  The grounds are
             arguable.'

11. At the error of law hearing before me there was  no  appearance  by  or
    behalf of the Appellant.  At 11.00 I asked  my  clerk  to  contact  the
    nominated representative, Primarc Solicitors.  They indicated that they
    had told the Appellant of the date of the hearing but there had been no
    response from him and no further contact.

12. Being satisfied that notice of the hearing  had  been  given  and  that
    there  was  no  satisfactory  explanation  for  his  non-appearance  or
    response I proceeded with the hearing in absence.

13. I would add that later that day subsequent to the hearing I received  a
    fax timed 14.41 from the solicitors  stating  that  the  Appellant  was
    'unable to attend the court hearing today as  he  is  unwell'.   I  was
    asked to 'decide this matter in his absence'.

14. I heard submissions from Mr Tarlow.

15. I can deal with this matter in brief.    Mr  Tarlow  did  not  seek  to
    argue that the letter from Docklands College was not submitted in time.
     The due date was 30 June 2013.  It was submitted on 29 June  2013.   I
    agreed.  In concluding otherwise the judge erred.

16. However, it was not a  material  error.   I  agreed  with  Mr  Tarlow's
    further submission that the letter from Docklands  College  was  not  a
    valid CAS.  It is dated 28 June 2013  and  headed  'Conditional  letter
    Tier 4 - Adult Student'. There is no CAS number.  It  states  that  the
    Appellant 'has been conditionally accepted on the  following  full-time
    course as detailed below' (viz PG Diploma in Hospitality,  Tourism  and
    Management).  At the end it states 'Note: CAS will  be  generated  upon
    successful submission of CEFR Level B2 confirmation for all the modules
    from an UKBA Approved Centre'.

17. As the grounds seeking permission acknowledge,  the  letter  issued  by
    Docklands College was conditional on the English  language  requirement
    being met.  A TOEIC certificate was, it is claimed, later provided.  It
    is not before me but it may well be  that  such  was  so  and  that  it
    satisfies the  English  language  requirement.   The  problem  for  the
    Appellant is that the certificate is, by  his  own  account,  dated  13
    November 2013 and is thus subsequent to the Respondent's decision  made
    on 11 July 2013.

18. Under s85A 'Matters to be considered: new evidence: exceptions' this  a
    PBS case, thus Exception 2 applies.  s85A(4) states:

         'Where Exception 2  applies  the  Tribunal  may  consider  evidence
         adduced by the applicant only if it:

         (a)  was submitted in support of, and at the time  of  making,  the
             application to which the immigration decision related.'

19. As the TOEIC certificate was submitted not with  the  application,  and
    indeed post decision, it was not admissible.

20. Although the First-tier Tribunal erred in not finding that  the  letter
    was submitted in time, as that letter was conditional and not  a  valid
    CAS the appeal  could  not  succeed.   The  Tribunal's  error  was  not
    material.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal against the refusal  to  vary  leave
does not show a material error of  law  and  that  decision  dismissing  the
appeal  stands.
