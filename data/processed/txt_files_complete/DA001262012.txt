Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Meredith, Counsel, instructed by Messrs Wilson
                    Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Nepal, born on 24 March 1990 appeals,  with
    permission, against a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Moore and Ms S E Singer (non-legal member))  who,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 2 August 2012, dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal against a decision of the respondent made on 22 November 2012 to
    make a deportation order against him.

2.   The  appellant's  father,  a  former  Ghurkha,  entered  Britain  on  6
    November 2006 with indefinite leave to remain.  On 16 May the appellant
    arrived in Britain with his  stepmother,  sister  and  their  brothers.
    They were granted leave to remain on that day.

3.   After entry the appellant committed a series of crimes, the details  of
    which were set out in paragraph 13 of the determination as follows:-

         ".   On 15th July 2009 convicted at East Kent Magistrates Court  of
             possessing a Class  A  drug,  namely  heroin  and  failing  to
             surrender to custody, for which the Appellant received a total
             fine of �150.


          .   On 28th September 2010  convicted  at  East  Kent  Magistrates
             Court of failing to surrender to custody and fined �100.


         .    On 29th November 2010 convicted at Canterbury Crown  Court  of
             burglary and 2 counts of theft by shop lifting.


         .    On 14th  January  2011  sentenced  to  a  12  month  Community
             Sentence, Treatment for Drug Dependency Order for 12 months, a
             Supervision Order for 2 years and a 3 month curfew.


         .    On 18th April 2011 and 4th May 2011 failed to attend a meeting
             with his Offender Manager and subsequently failed to attend  a
             hearing for breaching conditions  of  his  community  sentence
             imposed on 14th January 2011.


         .    On  20th  June  2011  arrested  for  breaching  conditions  of
             Community Service Order of 14th January 2011.


         .    On 19th May  2011  convicted  at  Canterbury  Crown  Court  of
             breaching a community order and breaching  a  12  months  Drug
             Rehabilitation Order and breaching a 2 year Supervision  Order
             and breaching a 3  month  curfew,  and  theft  from  shop  and
             burglary for which the Appellant received a total of 16 months
             imprisonment.


         .    On 27th July 2011 convicted at East Kent Magistrates Court  of
             2 counts of theft by shop  lifting  for  which  a  conditional
             discharge of 2 years was imposed."

4.   In their determination the Tribunal noted that the appellant had  lived
    with both his parents until the age of 11 when they had  separated  and
    thereafter the appellant's father had had  custody  of  him  while  his
    mother had gone to another part of Dharan in Nepal.  The appellant  had
    seen his mother occasionally after the separation.  The  appellant  had
    attended school in Dharan until he was aged 17 and came to Britain.  On
    arrival he had begun doing factory and then  got  a  job  with  KFC  in
    Dover, but had then started smoking heroin to which he became addicted.
     He had given up his job.  He had argued with his father  who  in  July
    2009 had sent him to Nepal for nine  months  for  rehabilitation  at  a
    clinic in Kathmandu.  On return the appellant had started taking  drugs
    again.

5.   In prison the  appellant  had  started  a  methadone  program  and  had
    attended rehabilitation courses, including  "relapse  and  prevention".
    On release he had been in immigration detention.

6.   The Tribunal noted the appellant had stated that he was ashamed of  the
    crimes he had committed and the shame he had brought on his father, but
    that he had learned much in prison and  detention.   He  hoped  to  get
    employment and earn money on his release to help his father  take  care
    of his younger siblings.

7.   The Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant's father  and  from  his
    sister.  They noted  documentary  evidence  which  was  produced  which
    included a forensic psychiatric report prepared  by  a  Dr  Amlan  Basu
    dated 5 June 2012.

8.   Having noted the submissions made, the Tribunal went on to  make  their
    findings of fact in paragraphs 25 onwards of the  determination.   They
    set out the appellant's immigration history, and then  stated  that  it
    was stated it was unclear  whether  the  appellant  had  any  telephone
    contact with his mother in Nepal as he had said that  he  has  not  had
    such contact while his father had  said  that  there  might  have  been
    telephone contact between the appellant  and  his  mother  because  she
    "sometimes telephones" the appellant.  They stated they were  satisfied
    that the appellant's drug addiction and  drug  usage  had  led  to  his
    criminal behaviour and went on to  say  that  they  believed  that  the
    appellant was genuine  in  being  ashamed  for  his  offences  and  for
    bringing shame on his father and family.

9.   They stated that they were  satisfied  the  appellant  had  not  always
    lived with his father and family in Britain in that he had  lived  away
    from the family home for six months after returning from Nepal,  during
    which time his father  had  said  that  he  had  no  contact  with  the
    appellant because he was busy working and that his friends had told him
    they had seen the appellant with others.

10.  They noted that the appellant's father had only visited  the  appellant
    on one occasion since he was sent to prison, and noted the  reason  for
    that was that the appellant's father was busy with his work.

11.  In paragraph 31 of the determination they noted the  submission  of  Ms
    Meredith who appeared for the appellant before them who told them  that
    "regard should be had to the fact that the appellant was not  sentenced
    to  imprisonment  for  the  index  offences".  The  tribunal,  however,
    commented that "whilst that is correct, it does not in our view  lessen
    the gravity of the  offences  and  indeed,  it  could  be  argued  that
    breaches of such a variety of  court  sentence  orders  might  be  more
    serious because not only did the appellant commit the  crimes,  but  he
    was unwilling or unable to show genuine regret or remorse by keeping to
    any of the court orders.

12.  They noted that the appellant had claimed that it was only when he  was
    sent to Canterbury Prison in 2011 that he had become involved in  CARAT
    programs and other courses and that he realised the impact of drugs and
    the relationship with crime.

13.  They noted the breach  report  which  showed  that  the  appellant  had
    failed to attend as  directed  in  May  2011  and  no  explanation  had
    provided, and it appeared the appellant had relapsed and was reliant on
    his family for funds since he was unemployed, even  though  the  family
    was experiencing financial difficulty.  They  stated  that  the  breach
    report of May 2011 had noted that the appellant's risk  of  reoffending
    significantly increased and that he was at medium risk  of  reoffending
    and medium risk of harm, and that the appellant  had  discontinued  all
    contact with the National Offender Management Register.

14.  In paragraph 33 they referred to the report of Dr Amlan  Basu  who  had
    stated that in relation to the facts that aggravated and minimised risk
    it was particularly difficult  for  the  appellant  "to  negotiate  the
    pressure exerted by his peers if he were to associate with them again".
     They went on to state that Dr Basu had:-

         "... further opined that should  the  appellant  be  released  from
         detention to live with his  family  in  the  Folkestone/Dover  area
         where he committed his previous offences, returning  to  live  with
         his family could not necessarily 'be considered a protective factor
         or a risk factor'."

15.  They noted that Dr Basu had added that reoffending would  be  minimised
    with meaningful education, training or employment and that  he  was  of
    the view that risk of offending was considered to  be  moderate,  which
    was the same  view  expressed  in  the  initial  presentence  probation
    report.  They stated that it was their  view  that  there  would  be  a
    reasonable likelihood of reoffending if the appellant returned to  live
    with his family  since  they  themselves  were  experiencing  financial
    difficulties,  "not  to  mention  any  other  financial  and  emotional
    difficulties that this appellant might bring up  them".   They  pointed
    out that the appellant  did  not  have  a  job  and  the  prospects  of
    employment would not be good.

16.  In paragraphs 34 and 35 of the determination they wrote:-

         "34.     The Appellant had lived apart from his father  and  family
             in the United Kingdom for at least 6 months  and  during  that
             period of time had no contact with his father.   The  physical
             contact between the Appellant and his father during  the  past
             year has been limited to one visit and we are unaware  of  any
             other family members visiting the Appellant  during  the  last
             year.  In the circumstances, we are not satisfied that even if
             the Appellant returned to live with his father that  he  would
             not ultimately involve himself in criminal behaviour,  with  a
             reasonable likelihood of leaving the family  home  and  living
             elsewhere as he previously had done and therefore being  again
             exposed to peer pressure and subsequent drug use and  criminal
             conduct.


         35.  We are satisfied that the Appellant  has  family  members  who
             live in Nepal.  His grandmother, with  whom  he  lived  before
             coming to the United Kingdom,  remains  in  the  family  home,
             although she is ill with throat  cancer  at  the  moment.   In
             addition, the Appellant's father  has  siblings  who  live  in
             Nepal and the fact that they are married and settled does  not
             prevent them  from  offering  assistance  to  this  Appellant.
             Further, we are satisfied that the  Appellant  has  more  than
             likely spoken with his mother on the telephone on occasions in
             the  past,  as  evidenced  by  the  evidence  given   by   the
             Appellant's father at this hearing, and also by  reference  to
             the pre-sentence report dated 31st  December  2010  (paragraph
             15) where the Appellant had apparently informed the  Probation
             Officer that his mother remained in Nepal and  he  spoke  with
             her occasionally on the telephone.  The Appellant  appears  to
             be a fit and healthy male of 22 years of age who could  return
             to Nepal and either live on his own if that was his  wish,  or
             return to live with a relative giving him the opportunity over
             a reasonable period of time to get some gainful employment."

17.  In paragraphs 36 onwards  of  the  determination  they  set  out  their
    conclusions.  They found that the appellant could not benefit from  the
    provisions of the Immigration Rules  relating  to  private  and  family
    life, before in paragraph  37  referring  to  the  relevant  structured
    approach to the issue of human rights set out in the judgment in Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27.

18.  They referred to the judgment in Uner v  Netherlands  [2005]  ECHR  464
    and took into account the various factors set out therein in that  they
    considered the solidity of the appellant's social, cultural and  family
    ties to Nepal, his offences which they viewed as serious, the fact that
    only one year had elapsed since the appellant's conduct involving crime
    and that  he  had  lived  in  Britain  since  May  2007,  although  not
    continuously as he had been in Kathmandu for nine months.  They  stated
    that they were aware that the appellant's father occasionally  returned
    to Nepal with his family and he done so in December 2010.

19.  Having referred to the judgment of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Kugathas
    [2003] EWCA Civ 31 they considered the issue of  family  life  and  the
    judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in AA  of  20  September
    2011 which they considered could be distinguished.

20.  In paragraph 41 stated that they were not satisfied that the  appellant
    had established a family life in the United Kingdom but  that  even  if
    they were satisfied that he had established family life with his father
    and sister, they were also satisfied that while  such  an  interference
    would engage Article 8, the interference would be lawful  and  that  it
    would be necessary in  a  democratic  society  for  the  prevention  of
    disorder  and  crime  and  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control.

21.  They went on to state that they were not satisfied that  the  appellant
    fell within one  of  the  exceptions  to  automatic  deportation  under
    section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 and that under  section  32(5)
    the respondent must make a deportation  order  in  respect  of  foreign
    nationals being convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence  and  who
    has been sentenced to a period  of  imprisonment  of  at  least  twelve
    months unless the foreign national fell within one  of  the  exceptions
    set out in section 33 of the 2007 Act.

22.  In paragraph 43 they stated that they were satisfied  any  interference
    with the appellant's private life was  proportionate.   They  therefore
    dismissed the appeal on human rights grounds  as  well  as  the  appeal
    against the deportation order.

23.  Detailed grounds of appeal were then submitted.

24.  Although permission to appeal was refused by Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Coates in the First-tier, on renewal permission was granted by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Allen who, although he gave  no  reasons  for  his
    decision, stated that he considered that the first  and  third  grounds
    were arguable, although he saw  little  arguable  merit  in  the  other
    grounds.

25.  Ms Meredith, at the hearing before me, relied on the grounds of  appeal
    as well as on a lengthy skeleton argument which largely  reflected  the
    grounds.

26.  The first ground of appeal claimed that the Tribunal had  misunderstood
    or inflated the appellant's offending, firstly because in paragraph  31
    the Tribunal had said that the breaches of the "court sentence  orders"
    might be more serious because not only had the appellant committed  the
    crimes but had been unwilling or  unable  to  show  genuine  regret  or
    remorse by keeping to any of the court orders.  I consider there is  no
    merit in that issue.  The reality is that what the  Tribunal  said  was
    fair comment.  The fact that the appellant did not keep  to  the  court
    orders is a reflection on his attitude towards the sentence itself.   I
    point out that, in any way, what the  Tribunal  stated  was  that  that
    interpretation "was arguable".

27.  Ms Meredith asserted that the  Tribunal  had  ignored  the  appellant's
    evidence of remorse but that is clearly wrong given what  the  Tribunal
    wrote in paragraphs 15, 20 and, in particular, 27 of the determination.
     They indeed found, as a fact, that the appellant was genuine in  being
    ashamed for his offences and for  bringing  shame  on  his  father  and
    family.

28.  Although in the  grounds  of  appeal  Ms  Meredith  asserted  that  the
    Tribunal had found that the appellant was unable or unwilling  to  show
    genuine regret or remorse and that was contradicted by the pre-sentence
    report which had  said  that  the  appellant  was  remorseful  for  his
    offences, that assertion in the grounds ignores  the  passages  of  the
    determination to which I have referred above and indeed is a  selective
    interpretation  of  the  pre-sentence  report  which  states  that  the
    appellant, "who had asked for ten other  offences  of  burglary  to  be
    taken into account had, as the writer  of  the  report  wrote,  'in  my
    assessment, he lacks an understanding of the wider implications of  his
    offending as although he felt the victims who discovered him  intruding
    would have felt shocked he had not seemed to have  considered  how  his
    presence would have been likely to cause alarm and distress and how  by
    burgling properties he took away the residents' feeling of  safety  and
    security within their home.

29.  The writer of the report also stated:-

         "In my assessment he displays deficits  in  his  awareness  of  the
          impact of his offences on his victims and the potential for  there
          to be  long  term  and  wider  consequences,  particularly  as  he
          admitted that once or twice he was  caught  in  the  act  and  the
          occupier screamed."


     Indeed, the conclusions of  the  writer  of  the  report  are  that  he
    assessed the appellant to "pose a medium risk of serious  harm  to  the
    general public due to the potential for him to cause victims  emotional
    harm as a result of  his  causing  distress  by  trespassing  on  their
    property and in doing so destroying their feeling  of  security  within
    their home and potentially causing distress if they  encounter  him  in
    the process of offending".

30.  Ms Meredith went on to refer to the report  of  Dr  Basu  to  show  the
    genuineness of the appellant's remorse but the reality is that Dr Basu,
    in a summary of findings stated that the appellant posed a medium  risk
    of reoffending and that his risk of relapsing to drug use and therefore
    reoffending "impacted largely   by  his  association  with  drug  using
    peers".  He therefore stated that as the appellant had been living with
    his family when he committed the previous offences, returning  to  live
    with his family "cannot  necessarily be considered a protective  factor
    or a risk factor in this case".

31.  Ms Meredith went on to state that the  Tribunal  could  have  conflated
    the appellant's  offences.   The  grounds  stated  that  there  was  no
    consideration:-

         "That A's first three offences were simple possession x 1; on  2  x
         failure to failure to surrender resulted  in  the  lowest  possible
         sentence in range, namely a fine.  A did not receive a  variety  of
         court sentence orders: he received only one supervision order."

32.  In her oral submissions Ms Meredith argued that the Tribunal  had  been
    wrong in the way they had listed the appellant's offences in  paragraph
    13 of the determination from which I have quoted above.   Her  argument
    appeared to centre on the penultimate bullet point which she emphasised
    that it appeared to read as if the appellant had been convicted for two
    offences of theft and burglary when the reality was that on 19 May 2011
    he was sentenced after the conviction on 29 November 2010.

33.  I consider that there is no merit in that  assertion,  nor  indeed  her
    assertion that the Tribunal had referred to orders as sentences because
    the reality in this case is that the offence which led to the  decision
    to deport the appellant was the sentence imposed in May 2011  from  the
    shop and for burglary.

34.  In this regard I note  the  sentencing  remarks  of  Her  Honour  Judge
    Williams who stated in May 2011 that:-

         "In January I gave you a chance to rehabilitate yourself and  deal
         with your heroin addiction.  Unhappily, although you  made  a  good
         start under the drug treatment and testing order, you  failed  then
         and slid back into heroin use.


         The offences which I deal with you for  are  serious,  a  domestic
         burglary, two shoplifting offences and ten matters which you invite
         the court to take into consideration.


         I keep the inevitable sentence of imprisonment down to an absolute
         minimum.  I give you some credit for making some effort  to  honour
         the community order and I take the ten offences into consideration.


         The least sentence on my judgment  I  can  pass  on  the  domestic
         burglary count is one of sixteen months'  imprisonment.   You  will
         serve half that.  And on expiration of that sentence, it  will  not
         bring the sentence to an end; should  you  commit  another  offence
         between your release and the balance of the  sentence  you  can  be
         returned to custody.


         In addition you will be on a supervision and break  the  terms  of
         supervision and can be returned to custody.  Use this time to  make
         sure that you are completely drug free and on your release  do  not
         commit offences again.  Take him down please.


         Three months' concurrent on each of the theft matters."

35.   The  reality  is  that  the  sentence  which  the  appellant  received
    triggered consideration under the automatic deportation order and, that
    having been brought into play, the issue was whether or not one of  the
    exceptions in section 33 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

36.  Ms Meredith then  argued  that  the  Tribunal  had  erred  in  findings
    relating to the appellant's family life in Nepal,  stating  that  there
    was no evidence the appellant had contact with his mother.  She  stated
    that the appellant's father had three wives.  His third wife  was  with
    him in Britain.  The second,  Devkala,  who  was  not  the  appellant's
    mother, is in Nepal, and that the appellant's father had separated from
    the appellant's mother when the appellant was aged 11.  She stated that
    the appellant had no contact with his mother.

37.   She  accepted,  however,  that  the  appellant  had  lived  with   his
    grandmother in Nepal and that his grandmother was still alive.  He  had
    also lived with an aunt, although she asserted that that aunt  had  now
    left to live in Singapore.

38.  The reality is that the appellant has paternal uncles, his  grandmother
    and his mother in Nepal.  Moreover, he had not lived  with  his  father
    all the time that he had been in Britain.  He is now an adult  aged  22
    and although he was released on bail from immigration detention  he  is
    not living with his family at the present time.

39.  Ms Meredith went on to state that  the  Tribunal  had  erred  in  their
    consideration of the scope of family life and that they  had  conflated
    the first and fifth steps set out in the judgment in Razgar.

40.  The Tribunal did take into account a number of  factors  regarding  the
    appellant's family life, setting these out in paragraphs 34 onwards  of
    the determination.  Their conclusions regarding family  life  that  the
    appellant was not exercising family life in the United Kingdom with his
    father was, I consider, open to them given  the  facts  of  this  case.
    Given the appellant's age and the fact that he is  not  living  in  the
    family home I consider that their conclusions were open to them.   They
    correctly referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in  Kugathas
    and distinguished the situation of the appellant in AA  from  that  the
    appellant.  They were clearly right  to  do  so.   Each  case  must  be
    considered on its own merits.  While it is trite law that  family  life
    does not come to  an  end  when  an  appellant  attains  majority,  the
    relevant factors must be considered and in this  I  consider  that  the
    Tribunal reached a conclusion which was open to them.  However, even if
    they were wrong to find that there  was  no  family  life  between  the
    appellant and the other members of his family here, the reality is that
    they did go on to go through the relevant step by step approach  before
    reaching their decision.

41.  Ms Meredith argued that the Tribunal had "failed to consider that  they
    are bound to apply particular criteria 'where the person to be expelled
    is a young adult who has not yet founded a  family  of  his  own'"  and
    referred to the criteria set out in the judgment of the European  Court
    of Human Rights in Maslov v Austria 1638/03 [2008] ECHR 546.

42.  It is, however, not an error of law for a Tribunal not to set  out  the
    criteria in the judgment in Maslov.  In this case the Tribunal did take
    into account all relevant factors, including the  length  of  time  the
    appellant had been in Britain, his ties  with  his  home  country,  his
    relationship with his other family members  here,  the  nature  of  the
    offending, the length of time since the appellant had last committed an
    offence, and the nature of the offence itself.  All these  matters  are
    dealt  with  by  the  Tribunal  in  paragraph  25  through  43  of  the
    determination.

43.  While I consider that it would have been preferable  for  the  Tribunal
    to set out the relevant structured  approach  in  Razgar  first  before
    making their findings of fact and then setting  out  their  conclusions
    having weighed up the relevant findings that they had made, the reality
    is that the Tribunal did consider the relevant factors  and  that  what
    appears the bare statement in paragraph 43 refers back to the balancing
    exercise which is clearly  evident  in  what  the  Tribunal  states  at
    paragraphs 25 onwards.

44.  Ms Meredith's final ground appeared to be that  the  Tribunal  had  not
    taken into account the "historic injustice" relating to  the  treatment
    of Ghurkha soldiers as part of the balancing exercise.  I consider that
    there is simply no merit in that assertion.   The  issue  of  "historic
    injustice" was clearly dealt with in this case by  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's father was given leave to enter and remain in  Britain,  as
    indeed was the appellant.  The fact that the appellant went on,  having
    been granted leave to enter, to commit crimes here is  the  reason  for
    the deportation.  There is  no  reason  why  any  "historic  injustice"
    should mean that the deportation of a criminal should not take place.

45.  In weighing up all the relevant factors the Tribunal did  not  set  out
    the relevant factors in N (Kenya), Masih (deportation - public interest
    - basic principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT and DS (India) [2009] EWCA Civ
    544 which emphasised that the importance of the removal of  a  criminal
    from Britain is a reflection  of  the  public  interest  in  preventing
    criminality.  But, be that as it may, the decision of the Tribunal that
    removal of this appellant was proportionate was a  decision  which  was
    entirely open to them and was correct.

46.  I therefore find that the determination of the Tribunal  in  this  case
    dismissing this appeal on both immigration  and  human  rights  grounds
    shall stand.
