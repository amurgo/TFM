Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr N Paramjorthy, instructed by AP Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mohana Ramachandran, date of birth 30.8.53, is a citizen
    of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Snape, who dismissed his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent, dated 30.5.13, to refuse her application made on 7.3.13 for
    an EEA residence card as confirmation of a right to reside  permanently
    in the UK.

 3. The application was made on the basis that the appellant was  the  non-
    EEA  national  family  member  of  Suganniya  Harthanakumar,  a  German
    national and the appellant's daughter, who claimed  to  have  exercised
    Treaty rights in the UK for a continuous period of 5 years, pursuant to
    regulation 15(1)(b) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 4. The Judge heard the appeal on 13.2.14.

 5. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.4.14.

 6. Thus the matter came before me on 2.6.14 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 7. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Snape should be set aside.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Holmes found it arguable  "That
    the Judge misread the payslips that were before him; although there was
    no(t) a complete run of payslips the content  of  those  that  were  in
    evidence  showed  that  the  sponsor  had  been  in  employment  for  a
    significant part (if not all) of the break in  the  continuity  of  the
    payslips or the earnings to date figure could not have been as it  was.
    The judge also makes no reference in the Determination to the  guidance
    on jobseekers to be found in Shabani [2013] UKUT 315. Accordingly it is
    arguable that the Judge's finding that he was not satisfied the sponsor
    had been exercising treaty rights for the requisite five year period is
    unsafe, and not one that he could have reached on the evidence  had  he
    properly directed himself."

 9. There was no Rule 24 response from the Secretary of State.

10. The relevant background can be summarised  as  follows.  The  appellant
    first arrived in the UK on 26.11.07 and on 23.1.08 was issued  with  an
    EEA residence card as the family member of her daughter. It is  claimed
    that her daughter worked for Tesco between 22.1.07 and 31.8.12. She was
    then a jobseeker, until she commenced employment with PMK  Construction
    on 1.12.12.

11. There was a gap in the evidence of the Tesco payslips,  between  8.7.11
    and 23.12.11. The  point  is  made  that  although  there  are  missing
    payslips for those months, the earnings to date figure on the  23.12.11
    payslip shows a figure of �5,042.79 when the  figure  for  earnings  to
    date on the 8.7.11 payslip was only �1,908.56. Thus  the  EEA  national
    must have been earning a salary from Tesco during the  period  in  2011
    for which there are missing payslips. It is not entirely clear but  the
    judge may have accepted this point. However, the difficulty  arises  in
    relation to 2012.

12. The EEA national claims to have worked for Tesco until 31.8.12, but the
    last payslip produced is for 8.6.12, and  thus  there  are  two  months
    missing for the claimed employment in 2012. That she remained  employed
    by Tesco until 31.8.12 cannot be inferred in the same way as in respect
    of the period of missing wage slips in 2011.

13. The HMRC letter at page 8 of  the  appellant'  bundle,  dated  3.10.12,
    indicates that the EEA national's Jobseeker's Allowance claim ended  on
    4.9.12. However, there is no evidence as to when that claim  commenced.
    In  oral  evidence  Ms  Mathanakumar  stated  that  this  document  was
    inaccurate, as it did not refer to any income from employment  for  the
    financial year ending 5.4.12.

14. The  EEA  national  stated  that  she  commenced  employment  with  PMK
    Construction on 1.12.12  and  there  are  wage  slips  for  the  period
    December 2012 to February 2013. It follows that there  are  unexplained
    gaps between the end of the Jobseeker's Allowance claim on  4.9.12  and
    the commencement of employment with PMK Construction in December 2012.

15. At �15  of  the  determination,  Judge  Snape  noted  the  respondent's
    representative submitted that  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  EEA
    national was exercising Treaty rights in the UK between  September  and
    December 2012. Clearly that was the period of concern to the judge,  as
    it fell within the five-year period relied on by the appellant.

16. At �22 the judge stated that from the evidence produced he  was  unable
    to conclude that the EEA national, the appellant's daughter, had worked
    continuously for Tesco during the period claimed. As stated above,  the
    period claimed was 22.1.07 through to 31.8.12. There was no HMRC record
    of employment after 5.5.12. A HMRC document, dated 5.3.13,  shows  only
    employment to the close of the 2010/2011 tax year. It is  curious  that
    if the EEA national was employed until 31.8.12, she did not ask for the
    employment records for the 2011/2012 tax year.

17. Even if the judge did not accept the inference from the payslips  there
    was continuous employment in 2011, which, as stated above, is  unclear,
    it remains the case that there is  no  evidence  of  employment  beyond
    8.6.12 until 1.12.12. During that period the EEA national registered as
    a Jobseeker, but when she so registered is not clear. It is  clear,  as
    the judge noted at �21, that the claim ceased on  4.9.12,  some  months
    before the new employment started. These  are  breaks  in  the  5  year
    period relied on by the appellant.

18. In the circumstances, on the evidence available to him, the  judge  was
    entirely correct to conclude that the appellant's daughter continuously
    exercised Treaty rights in the UK for the necessary  five-year  period.
    The grounds for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  focused  on
    the 2011 missing payslips, as did Judge Holmes in  granting  permission
    to appeal. The period between June and August 2012  and  again  between
    September  and  December  2012  have  not  been   addressed.   In   the
    circumstances it was inevitable that the appeal would be dismissed.

19. I reviewed the relevant periods and documents with the  representatives
    at the hearing before me. Mr Paramjorthy very fairly conceded  that  he
    could not prove continuous employment in 2012. It rather seems that the
    grounds of  appeal  and  the  grant  of  permission  misunderstood  the
    determination and the limited evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal.
    The judge did not misread the documentary evidence.

20. The appellant claims that she can now prove  the  necessary  continuous
    period of employment, but as that evidence was not  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, it will be for the appellant to make a new application.

Conclusions:

21. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal was correctly dismissed in the First-tier Tribunal.
