                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Garratt promulgated 22.4.16, allowing  on  human  rights
    grounds only his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State,
    dated 6.11.14, to refuse his  asylum,  humanitarian  and  human  rights
    claims made on 28.1.11.  The Judge heard the appeal on 15.2.16.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.5.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 19.7.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons briefly set out below, I found there was  an  error  of
    law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  that
    the decision of Judge Garratt should be set aside and remade.

 5. The appellant first arrived in the UK in about December 2010, aged  16.
    He sought asylum and/or international protection on the basis  that  on
    return to Iran he would face mistreatment due to his political opinion,
    namely distributing KDPI leaflets with his father, a KDPI member.

 6. His application was first refused on 1.4.11,  the  Secretary  of  State
    rejecting his factual account of events in Iran,  but  he  was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain until 1.5.12, when he would reach the age
    of 17�, in accordance with the Secretary of State's policy. His  appeal
    against refusal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal on 2.6.11  and
    he was refused permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 7. On 16.5.12 the appellant made  an  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain in the UK. This was refused in the decision  of  6.11.14,  which
    decision is the subject of this appeal. His appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was dismissed by the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Frankish promulgated 27.2.15. However, on appeal to the Upper Tribunal,
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside  for  failure  to
    give detailed consideration to the expert report of Dr Kakhki, and  the
    decision in the appeal was remitted to be remade afresh in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 8. The appeal was then heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Garratt  on
    15.2.16. In the First-tier Tribunal decision promulgated 22.4.16  Judge
    Garratt gave careful consideration to Dr Kakhki's report but  concluded
    at �63 that it was insufficient to displace the credibility findings of
    the first  judge,  who  had  accepted  that  the  appellant  left  Iran
    illegally. Judge Garratt concluded that the  appellant  had  not  shown
    that on leaving Iran he was at risk of serious harm at the hands of the
    authorities because of any claimed support for the KDPI.

 9. However, at �66 Judge Garratt went on to consider the issues of illegal
    exit and failure to perform military service, and the country  guidance
    of SB (Risk on return - illegal exit) CG [2009]  UKAIT  00053.  At  �67
    Judge Garratt concluded that there were risk  factors  unique  to  this
    appellant that would reasonably likely lead to a period of detention on
    return which created a real risk of harsh  treatment,  especially  when
    the appellant's poor health is taken into account. At �69 Judge Garratt
    concluded that investigation by the Iranian authorities would  "attract
    the real risk of detention  and  ill-treatment  at  the  hands  of  the
    Iranian authorities aggravated by his medical condition."

10. The judge then went on to state, "The consequences  could  be  seen  as
    making the appellant a refugee on that account alone but, if I am wrong
    in that conclusion, then I conclude that the appellant is  entitled  to
    humanitarian protection on account of  the  serious  harm,  defined  in
    paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules, which he will suffer. To  that
    extent I allow the appeal  on  humanitarian  protection  grounds."  The
    Judge concluded that final paragraph of the decision by observing  that
    as the appeal had been allowed on humanitarian  protection  grounds  it
    was unnecessary to consider article 8 and  3,  though  in  passing  the
    judge also found it clear that the appellant was additionally  at  real
    risk of suffering which would amount to a breach of article 3.

11. The decision in the appeal was to  allow  the  appeal  on  humanitarian
    protection grounds.

12. The appellant seeks to appeal Judge Garratt's decision, contending that
    he should also have been successful on asylum grounds. Additionally, it
    is pleaded that the judge failed to properly assess Dr Kakhki's  expert
    report and erred in relation  to  the  findings  on  the  arrest/search
    warrant and the lack of supporting evidence.

13. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Macdonald  found  that  it  was
    "arguably unclear as to why, given the appellant's profile,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal on humanitarian protection grounds only. It can also
    be said that Dr Kakhi's  report  is  very  detailed  and  arguably  did
    displace  the  findings  of  credibility  within  the  earlier  judge's
    determination. There may also be  merit  in  the  final  point  on  the
    arrest/search warrant and in the adverse inference  drawn  against  the
    appellant by the lack of supporting evidence."

14. It is not clear to me why, given his clear findings, Judge Garratt  did
    not allow the appeal on asylum grounds. It may be, from the wording  of
    the last paragraph of the decision that the Judge intended to allow the
    appeal on  asylum  grounds  and  in  the  alternative  on  humanitarian
    protection, and indeed in the further alternative  on  article  3  ECHR
    grounds.

15. It seems clear from the findings of Judge Garratt that on the basis  of
    the risk to the appellant on return of being detained and  interrogated
    and thereby  suffering  ill-treatment  at  the  hands  of  the  Iranian
    authorities, the appellant would qualify for asylum as having  a  well-
    founded fear of  persecution  on  grounds  of  his  actual  or  imputed
    political opinion. At �67 the judge accepted Dr Kakhki's opinion that a
    failed asylum seeker would face an investigation on return and that  it
    should be assumed that he would then tell the truth about  his  illegal
    departure and time in the UK.  He  would  also,  Judge  Garratt  found,
    disclose that he is a Kurd from the Kurdish region of  Iran,  who  left
    the country illegally to make a claim based on  support  for  KDPI  and
    arrest, even if those claims were rejected by the Tribunal  on  appeal.
    Dr Kakhki's report suggested that that those factors would give rise to
    the interest of the authorities in the appellant and he would likely be
    detained, rather than bailed. It will also be noted that he had avoided
    military service.

16. It was those risk factors, which Judge Garratt considered to be  unique
    to the appellant, that  persuaded  the  judge  that  the  appellant  is
    reasonably likely, to the lower standard of proof, to face mistreatment
    on return.  In  effect,  the  mistreatment  would  arise  from  imputed
    political opinion. As the grounds of appeal explain, the appellant only
    has to establish a connection between the serious harm he will face and
    one of the Convention reasons; it need  not  be  the  sole  or  primary
    reason for the apprehended mistreatment, provided it  is  an  effective
    reason.

17. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal should, and may  well  have
    intended, to allow the appeal on asylum grounds on the basis of imputed
    political opinion, arising from  his  failed  KDPI-related  claim,  his
    illegal exit  and  his  continuing  evasion  of  military  service,  in
    conjunction with his susceptibility to  harm  by  reason  of  his  ill-
    health. Mr Bates did not offer any resistance to this conclusion.

18. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to address the other  grounds
    of appeal, as Mr Draycott agreed.

19. The correct course should be to set the decision aside and remake it on
    exactly the same findings, but to allow it on asylum grounds.

Conclusions:

20. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  on
                    asylum grounds.

                    In  the  alternative,   the   appeal   is   allowed   on
                    humanitarian protection  grounds,  and  in  the  further
                    alternative on article 3 ECHR grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  continue  the
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
