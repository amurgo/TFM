Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Wilcox (for Lamptons Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of  Asim  Ali,  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  born  10
       September 1984, against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       (Judge Cary) of 11 January 2019 dismissing his appeal on human rights
       grounds, itself brought against the refusal of his human rights claim
       of 24 August 2018.

    2. The immigration history provided by the Respondent sets out that  the
       Appellant arrived in the UK on 2 October 2006, with  entry  clearance
       as a student, and held leave as such until 31  October  2010.  On  20
       December 2010 he applied for further leave as a  Tier  4  student  to
       study at Union College, and he was granted leave to  remain  from  26
       January 2011 until 14 October 2013. However  Union  college  had  its
       licence revoked and his leave was curtailed to expire on 27 May 2012.



    3. By now the Appellant had married Anum Akhtar, on 19 May 2012, and  he
       applied for leave to remain as her partner, which was granted from  4
       February 2013 until 4 February 2015, extended until 14 March 2017. On
       14 March 2017 he applied for further leave  to  remain,  now  on  the
       basis of his private and family life,  confirming  he  still  resided
       with Ms Akhtar. This application was refused and certified as clearly
       unfounded, and thus did not carry the right of appeal,  on  12  April
       2018. However following a Pre Action  Protocol  letter  which  argued
       that he had a viable claim for indefinite leave to  remain  based  on
       his ten years of lawful UK residence, the decision was  reconsidered,
       the new refusal bearing the right of appeal.

    4. Before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant explained  that  he  was
       now separated from his wife. His explanation for  the  break  in  his
       leave was his having been severely injured in  a  road  accident.  He
       received a head injury and was taken  to  hospital,  then  discharged
       after a few hours, however his  knee  then  swelled  leaving  him  in
       immense pain; he was bedbound for some time thereafter. It was  later
       discovered that his knee was fractured. He was unable to obtain a CAS
       from Birmingham FBT College as over this  period  he  was  unable  to
       visit them in person.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant  had  established
       some form of private life in the UK having  lived  here  continuously
       since 2006 apart from various visits to Pakistan, most recently  from
       late December 2013 to early February 2014.

    6. The problem confronting his long residence application was the gap in
       his leave from 31 October 2010 to  26  January  2011.  The  Appellant
       argued that the fact that his application  was  subsequently  granted
       effectively condoned his overstaying. The Judge did not accept  this,
       noting that the Secretary of State  was  entitled  to  grant  further
       leave, but that this did not retrospectively legalise the  period  of
       overstay, which was over a period where section 3C of the Immigration
       Act 1971 did not operate to render the Appellant's  presence  lawful.
       Having regard to the published guidance on  these  cases,  the  Judge
       noted  that  there  was  no  requirement   for   "very   exceptional"
       circumstances, albeit that the threshold was a high one, equating  to
       incapacitation by way of hospitalisation in a case  where  the  delay
       was attributed to health problems.

    7. The Judge found that the Appellant's claim to have been incapacitated
       for a lengthy period was not corroborated  by  the  medical  evidence
       produced. The only report from  the  time  of  the  accident  was  an
       emergency medicine department report from Heartlands Hospital stating
       he had attended at 12:14am on 9  October  following  a  road  traffic
       collision, suffering from a minor head  injury,  and  was  discharged
       with no follow up. The  sickness  certificate  from  Woodrow  Medical
       Centre did not describe him as immobile; they merely referred to  him
       being unfit for work and one referenced a  Whiplash  injury  with  no
       mention of his knee. A consultant orthopaedic surgeon recorded  in  a
       report of 11 April 2011 that the Appellant had suffered  injuries  to
       his neck, left arm and left leg; his left knee swelled up some  hours
       after the accident, and slowly improved over a month  or  so,  though
       the pain never fully subsided. He was not limited to  any  particular
       activities. The actual injury appeared to be  a  possible  "posterior
       horn tear of the medical meniscus" rather than a fracture. There  was
       no evidence from the college to confirm he would have  had  to  visit
       them in person to obtain a CAS. He had been assisted  by  family  and
       friends following the accident, and there  was  no  reason  why  they
       could not have assisted him with  the  college  if  he  had  mobility
       issues.

    8. Accordingly the First-tier Tribunal found that the Appellant had  not
       established a viable claim for ten years lawful residence in the  UK.
       Assessing his human rights claim more generally, he  had  established
       his private life in this country whilst his  immigration  status  was
       precarious and he had no expectation of further  residence  here.  He
       spoke English and had not been dependent on the  state  (albeit  that
       his present means of support was unclear),  so  those  considerations
       did not count against him. His witness statement was remarkably light
       on detail and it  was  unclear  how  he  had  spent  his  time  since
       finishing his studies in August 2010. He had lived in Pakistan  until
       the age of 22 and would be able to assimilate there, given  he  spoke
       the language.

    9. Grounds of appeal argued that given the Appellant had relied upon the
       same exceptional circumstances both in the December 2010  application
       and on his application for indefinite leave to remain, it had been an
       error of law for the Secretary of State to fail to take  account  the
       fact that his earlier decision had condoned the break in leave.

   10. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 14 March  2019  on
       the basis that the  ostensible  inconsistency  in  the  Secretary  of
       State's approach to the extension and settlement  applications  might
       have  been  a  necessary   consideration   in   the   assessment   of
       proportionality.

   11. At the hearing  I  remarked  that  the  Appellant's  case  needed  to
       confront the fact that Rule 276B, in so far as it addressed breaks in
       a migrant's leave, by definition presupposed a  subsequent  grant  of
       leave  that,  at  least  to  some  extent,  must  have  condoned  the
       particular break in question. Mr Wilcox for the  Appellant  submitted
       that there was more to this particular case than  a  bare  subsequent
       grant of leave,  because  there  had  been  an  express  exercise  of
       discretion in the Appellant's favour in 2011 on  precisely  the  same
       basis as he had sought in the application giving rise to this appeal.
       Discretion should be exercised consistently. The  April  2011  letter
       from  Worcester  Acute  Hospitals  NHS  Trust   contained   important
       information  that  demonstrated   that   the   Appellant   had   been
       incapacitated over the relevant period.

   12. For the Respondent, it was submitted that there was no obligation  to
       exercise discretion consistently: the Secretary of  State's  exercise
       of power would otherwise lack the quality of discretion. Anyway there
       was more information before the First-tier Tribunal than  was  before
       the Secretary of State, including the  live  oral  evidence,  all  of
       which was found collectively wanting.

  Findings and reasons

   13. I do not accept that there  was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal for the following reasons.

   14. In principle the Appellant's case is an arguable one. The appeal  was
       brought by reference to his right to private  life  under  the  Human
       Rights Convention. If he had a viable case under the Rules,  then  so
       long as he had established private life in the UK, his  appeal  would
       inevitably succeed: see TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) [2018] EWCA  Civ
       1109 ï¿½35. If his case failed under the Rules  but  could  succeed  by
       reference to published guidance, then  the  public  policy  judgments
       supplementing the Rules would be relevant to his  appeal's  prospects
       outside them. As stated by Richards LJ in Tozlukaya [2006]  EWCA  Civ
       379 (and applied in AG Kosovo [2007] UKAIT 00082):

           "If a policy tells in  favour  of  the  person  concerned  being
           allowed to stay in this country, it may affect the balance under
           article 8(2) and provide a proper basis for a finding  that  the
           case is an exceptional one."

   15. The Supreme Court noted  stated  in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC  10,
       "although the tribunal must make its own judgment, it  should  attach
       considerable weight to judgments made by the Secretary  of  State  in
       the exercise of her  constitutional  responsibility  for  immigration
       policy." Lord Carnwath in the Supreme Court makes the same  point  in
       Patel [2013] UKSC 72, stated at [55] that "the balance drawn  by  the
       rules may be relevant to the consideration of proportionality".

   16. Rule 276B provides:

           "Long residence in the United Kingdom

           276A. For the purposes of paragraphs 276B to 276D and 276ADE(1).



           ...

           (b)   "lawful residence" means  residence  which  is  continuous
           residence pursuant to:

                (i)    existing leave to enter or remain; or

                (ii)   temporary admission within section 11 of the 1971 Act
                (as previously in force), or immigration bail within section
                11 of the 1971 Act,  where  leave  to  enter  or  remain  is
                subsequently granted;

           ...

           276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for  indefinite
           leave to remain on the ground of long residence  in  the  United
           Kingdom are that:

           (i)   ... he  has  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
           residence in the United Kingdom.

           (ii)  having regard to the public interest there are no  reasons
           why it would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave
           to remain on the ground of long residence, taking  into  account
           his:

                (a)    age; and

                (b)    strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and

                (c)     personal  history,  including  character,   conduct,
                associations and employment record; and

                (d)    domestic circumstances; and

                (e)    compassionate circumstances; and

                (f)    any representations received on the person's  behalf;
                and

           ...

           (v)   the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
           immigration laws, except that,  where  paragraph  39E  of  these
           Rules  applies,  any  current  period  of  overstaying  will  be
           disregarded. Any previous period of overstaying between  periods
           of leave will also be disregarded where -

                (a)    the previous application was made before 24  November
                2016 and within 28 days of the expiry of leave; or

                (b)    the further application  was  made  on  or  after  24
                November 2016 and paragraph 39E of these Rules applied."

   17. The relevant Home Office guidance states:

           "Gaps in lawful residence

           You may grant the application if an applicant:

           .     has short gaps in lawful residence through making previous
              applications out of time by no more  than  28  calendar  days
              where those gaps end before 24 November 2016

           .     has short gaps in lawful residence on or after 24 November
              2016 but leave was granted in accordance with  paragraph  39E
              of the Immigration Rules

           .     meets all the other requirements for lawful residence

           Periods of overstaying

           When refusing an application on the grounds it was  made  by  an
           applicant who had overstayed by more  than  28  days  before  24
           November 2016, you must consider  any  evidence  of  exceptional
           circumstances which prevented the applicant from applying within
           the first 28 days of overstaying.

           The threshold for what constitutes  'exceptional  circumstances'
           is high, but could include delays resulting from  unexpected  or
           unforeseeable causes. For example:

           .      serious  illness  which  meant  the  applicant  or  their
              representative was not able to submit the application in time
              - this must be supported by appropriate medical documentation

           .     travel or postal delays which meant the applicant or their
              representative was not able to submit the application in time

           .     inability to provide necessary documents - this would only
              apply in exceptional or unavoidable circumstances beyond  the
              applicant's control, for example:

              ?  it is the fault of the Home  Office  because  it  lost  or
                  delayed returning travel documents

              ?  there is a delay  because  the  applicant  cannot  replace
                  their documents quickly because of theft, fire or flood  -
                  the applicant must send evidence of the date of  loss  and
                  the date replacement documents were sought."

   18. Thus the long lawful residence Rule effectively prohibits  the  grant
       of leave (by declining to disregard  breaks  in  leave  exceeding  28
       days) to a person who has overstayed by  more  than  28  days  before
       making their next application. The Appellant had held leave until  31
       October 2010 and applied for further leave on 20  December  2010.  So
       clearly there was an overstay of some 20 days. The ultimate break  in
       leave was significantly longer, but the Rule and  guidance  focus  on
       the timing of the successful  application  rather  than  holding  the
       length of decision making against an applicant.

   19. The discretion supplementing the Rule provides for the grant of leave
       notwithstanding a period of excess overstaying so long as exceptional
       circumstances are demonstrated, including where serious illness  (and
       doubtless by analogy serious accident) prevented a timely application
       being made, the threshold applied  by  Home  Office  decision  makers
       being a "high" one. The First-tier  Tribunal  was  clearly  alive  to
       these aspects of the discretion, and appreciated that if in  its  own
       estimation the threshold for exceptional circumstances had  been  was
       surpassed, it should make a decision in accordance with the guidance.
       It seems to me that that was an entirely correct approach.

   20. Numerous authorities identity the value of the  principles  of  legal
       certainty  and  consistency.  The  Administrative  Court  cited  this
       passage from academic authority in SA [2015] EWHC 1611 (Admin):

           "De Smith's Judicial Review 6th ed.  (2007)  helpfully  explains
           the rationale behind these principles at paragraph 9-005:

                'The underlying rationale of the principle against fettering
                discretion is to ensure that two perfectly legitimate values
                of public law, those  of  legal  certainty  and  consistency
                (qualities at the heart of the principle of the rule of law)
                may be balanced by another  equally  legitimate  public  law
                value, namely, that of responsiveness. While allowing  rules
                and policies to promote the former values, it  insists  that
                the full rigour of certainty and consistency be tempered  by
                the willingness to make exceptions, to respond  flexibly  to
                unusual situations, and to apply justice in  the  individual
                case.'"

   21. David Richards LJ stated in Chirairo [2016] EWCA Civ 77 ï¿½25:

           "... a discretionary public law power must not be  exercised  in
           an arbitrary or partial way. If  two  individuals  in  identical
           circumstances are knowingly treated differently, this  may  well
           involve an arbitrary exercise of power in the  case  of  one  of
           them and, without a rational explanation, is liable to be struck
           down  as  unlawful.  Moreover,  the  circumstances  of  the  two
           individuals, though not identical, may be so similar as to  call
           for a rational explanation for the  different  treatment  to  be
           given, if the unfavourable treatment given to one is  to  stand.
           It would be unfair of the Secretary of State not to  treat  like
           cases alike in the sense of discriminating against someone  upon
           inadequate grounds: see R v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department, ex p Zeqiri [2002] UKHL  3  ...  at  [56]  per  Lord
           Hoffmann. Nonetheless,  caution  is  required.  First,  personal
           circumstances will usually differ to an  extent  which  prevents
           two individuals from being  treated  as  like  cases.  Secondly,
           different decision-makers  faced  with  substantially  the  same
           facts  may  on  entirely  rational  grounds  come  to  different
           conclusions: see Otshudi v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department [2004] EWCA Civ 893."

   22. Chirairo spoke  to  the  situation  where  decision  making  appeared
       inconsistent  as  between  similarly  placed  applicants;  the   same
       considerations must apply a fortiori when different  decision  makers
       confront the same applicant who relies on the same facts.  Where  the
       Tribunal  and  Secretary  of  State  are  confronted   by   identical
       information, one can well see that the same approach to the  exercise
       of discretion should be taken by  both  administrative  and  judicial
       decision makers. It is accordingly necessary to examine the  decision
       making in this particular case and the First-tier Tribunal's response
       to it.

   23. The Judge clearly appreciated the breadth and nature of the Secretary
       of State's discretion. However, when  it  evaluated  the  Appellant's
       case for itself, it found the Appellant's explanation of his state of
       incapacity to be wanting. It did not accept that the medical evidence
       supported  the  Appellant's  claim,  because  the  material  did  not
       indicate that the Appellant was wholly  immobile  over  the  relevant
       period (I note that a March 2011 letter refrred to the fact  that  by
       then at least the Appellant was  working  part-time  at  Pizza  Hut),
       particularly in the context  where  the  evidence  indicated  he  had
       friends and family to assist him with transport if necessary. It gave
       adequate reasons for its conclusions which are fully supported by the
       evidence it identified as supporting them; one could not possibly say
       that those conclusions were irrational.

   24. It is clear that the medical evidence put  forward  now  was  largely
       unavailable to the Secretary of State previously, as the  application
       of December 2010 predates much of the evidence now relied on (pages 3-
       4 of the Home Office refusal letter itemises the material provided on
       the present application, which included  seven  letters  and  reports
       from 2011).  It  is  not  possible  to  discern  precisely  what  the
       Secretary  of  State  was  previously  told  about  the   Appellant's
       circumstances, or what supporting evidence was provided. It may  well
       be that the Secretary of State took the  Appellant's  claim  to  have
       been completely incapacitated at face value. That, however,  was  not
       what the  medical  evidence  showed  when  subsequently  produced.  I
       accordingly  do  not  accept  that  the   First-tier   Tribunal   was
       effectively bound to make a finding that discretion should have  been
       exercised in the Appellant's favour simply by the fact that the  same
       general considerations underlay  both  the  December  2010  extension
       application and the ultimate  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
       remain.

   25. The Appellant's core submission on consistency having been addressed,
       it  remains  to  adderss  the  rest  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal's
       reasoning. Its conclusions  on  the  appeal  were  unsurprising.  The
       Appellant put forward only rather faint evidence of private  life  in
       the UK. Doubtless he has established private life  here,  but  absent
       meeting the criteria of an immigration  route  under  the  Rules,  he
       needed to establish a compelling case  in  order  to  show  that  the
       immigration decision was a disproportionate one. Given  the  lack  of
       detail of UK connections and the breakdown of his  relationship  with
       his former wife, it seems to me that the Judge  below  was  perfectly
       entitled to reject the Appellant's claim on these grounds.

   26. For these reasons I consider that the appeal must be dismissed.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
