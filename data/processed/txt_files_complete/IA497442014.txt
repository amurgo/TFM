Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr I Ikeh, instructed by Moorehouse Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A Weller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Philomena Oghogho Oghenovo, date of birth 6.3.86,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Tully promulgated 17.3.15,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse to issue an EEA  Residence
    Card as confirmation of a right to reside  in  the  UK  as  the  family
    member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the UK,  pursuant
    to the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006.   The  Judge  decided  the
    appeal on the papers at the request of the appellant, on  17.3.15,  and
    the decision was promulgated the same day.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison granted permission to  appeal
    on 11.5.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.8.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find that there was no error of law in
    the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require the decision of Judge Tully to be set aside.

 6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  on  the  basis
    that the appellant's representative had sent a letter to the  Tribunal,
    dated 13.3.15, requesting that the appeal be decided  by  way  of  oral
    hearing, rather than on the papers as had been requested in the  Notice
    of Appeal and consistent with the �80 fee paid, as opposed to the  �140
    fee for an oral hearing. Judge  Grant-Hutchison  stated,  "The  grounds
    submit that there is no consideration of the letter  before  the  judge
    reached her decision on the papers on 17 March 2015. It is an  arguable
    error of law that had the appellant been able to attend,  the  evidence
    may have made a material difference to the outcome or to  the  fairness
    of the proceedings."

 7. However, there is  no  evidence  that  the  letter  dated  13.3.15  was
    received by the Tribunal before the decision was made. Consistent  with
    the request in the Notice of Appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    appeal was allocated for a decision on the papers and was both  decided
    and promulgated on 17.3.15.

 8. Mr Ikeh stated that in the circumstances of such a request the Tribunal
    would send out a request for  the  balance  of  the  fee  for  an  oral
    hearing. No such request  was  sent  and  Mr  Ikeh  confirms  none  was
    received by the appellant's solicitors. The case file  before  me  does
    not show that any copy of this letter of 13.3.15 was received until the
    fax of 21.3.15 comprising the application to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. The fax was  set  after
    10:00pm on 21.3.15 and stamped as received by the Tribunal on  23.3.15.
    I put the hearing back in the list for a short period to allow Mr  Ikeh
    to see if he could produce any evidence to prove that  the  letter  was
    sent by fax and that it would have been received by the Tribunal before
    the decision dismissing the appeal was made by Judge Tully on  17.3.15.
    No such evidence was produced. I cannot accept  Mr  Ikeh's  submissions
    that the letter "would have been sent by fax,"  without  some  concrete
    evidence. That no such fax was received and  no  such  letter  received
    until the fax of 21.3.15 is entirely consistent with the  documents  in
    the case file before me.

 9. In the circumstances, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that  any
    such request for an oral hearing was received by the Tribunal prior  to
    the making and promulgation of the decision. It follows that  there  is
    no procedural unfairness in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and
    thus no error of law.

Conclusions:

10. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been dismissed.
