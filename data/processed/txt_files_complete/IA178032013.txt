                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Morrison promulgated on 28 November  2013  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Respondent dated 30  April  2014  to
    refuse to vary leave to remain and to remove him from the  UK  pursuant
    to section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on 10 January 1977.  His
    (undisputed) immigration history is set out in the cover sheet  to  the
    Respondent's  bundle  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  is  also
    summarised at paragraph 7 of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal:
    it is unnecessary  to  reproduce  the  history  again  here  -  I  make
    reference to such matters as is incidental  for  the  purpose  of  this
    document.

 3. On 30 October 2012 during the  currency  of  his  previous  leave,  the
    Appellant made  an  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant. The application was refused for reasons set out
    in a combined 'reasons for refusal' letter and  Notice  of  Immigration
    Decision dated 8 May 2013,  with  particular  reference  to  paragraphs
    245DD(b) and (d). Essentially the Respondent  was  not  satisfied  with
    regard  to  the  supporting  evidence  supposedly  demonstrating   that
    ï¿½200,000 was available to invest  in  business  in  the  UK:  the  bank
    documents relied upon by the Appellant were from banks that appeared on
    Appendix P of the Rules as being  banks  that  did  not  satisfactorily
    verify financial document. Further the Appellant was not named  on  the
    bank letter from one of the two banks, and had not signed a third party
    declaration.  Additionally  it  was  stated  "in  line  with  paragraph
    245DD(l) of the Immigration Rules, [the Respondent had] not carried out
    an assessment as detailed in paragraph 245DD(h)".

 4. The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

 5. For reasons set out in his determination, the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal in  respect  of  the  application  for
    variation of leave under the Rules, dismissed the appeal on  Article  8
    grounds, but allowed the appeal in respect of the  section  47  removal
    decision.

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Parkes on 16 December 2013.

 7. The Respondent has filed a Rule 24 response dated 2 January 2014.

 8. Although there has been no cross-appeal in respect of  the  section  47
    decision, and although the Rule 24 response raises no issue in  respect
    of the Judge's decision to allow  the  appeal  in  this  regard,  after
    discussion it was common ground between the representatives  before  me
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had erred at  paragraph  22  in  her
    assessment of the relevant dates. The amendment to section  47  of  the
    2006 Act brought about by section 51 of the Crime and Courts  Act  2013
    had effect from 8 May 2013 and accordingly the Judge was  in  error  to
    determine that the decision made on 8 May 2013 had  been  made  on  the
    last day prior to the amendment: plainly it was  made  on  the  day  on
    which the amendment came into effect.

Consideration

 9. At the outset of the hearing Ms Isherwood indicated that  she  accepted
    that both the Respondent and in turn the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had
    been in error in relying upon the appearance of the  Appellant's  banks
    in Appendix P of the  Rules  in  circumstances  where  the  Appellant's
    application had predated the introduction of  the  relevant  provisions
    under the Rules. It was accepted that transitional provisions  set  out
    in the Statement of Changes in Immigration  Rules  (HC  760)  indicated
    that - save in respect of certain specified provisions  -  applications
    made prior to 13 December 2012 would be decided in accordance with  the
    Rules in force on 12 December 2012. Accordingly the relevant changes by
    way of the addition of Table 11 to Appendix P were  not  applicable  to
    the Appellant's application.

10. In consequence it was also acknowledged that the funds  in  the  Sonali
    bank  account  were  acceptable  for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  the
    maintenance requirement of the Rules.

11. In such circumstances Ms Isherwood acknowledged that the only  relevant
    'live' issue remaining was that of the 'third party declaration'.  (The
    relevant document can be found at pages H1 and H2 of  the  Respondent's
    bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.)

12. In this context the Respondent stated in the refusal "You have also not
    signed  the  third  party  declaration  which  makes  such  declaration
    invalid". This is a reference to  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-
    SD(b)(i)(3) of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

13. The Judge dealt with this issue at paragraph 18. It was noted  that  it
    was accepted that the relevant signature was not on the document, and a
    submission in respect of a change of  rules  was  rejected  given  this
    defect. The Judge also rejected a submission in respect  of  evidential
    flexibility for reasons set out at paragraph 19. Essentially the  Judge
    found that the nature of the defect was not covered by  the  provisions
    of paragraph 245AA of the Rules, and  such  provisions  superseded  the
    decision in Rodriguez. (In this context it is clear that the Judge  had
    in mind the decision of the Upper Tribunal, [2013] UKUT 42  (IAC),  and
    not the decision of the Court of Appeal, [2014] EWCA Civ 2,  which  was
    handed down on 20 January 2014 - i.e. after the hearing and decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal herein.)

14. The Appellant's challenge is  rooted  in  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Rodriguez: see paragraph 4 of the Grounds in support of the
    application  for  permission  to  appeal.  Necessarily  therefore   the
    challenge encounters the difficulty that  the  approach  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal was rejected by the Court of Appeal. Further, in so far as  it
    had been contended that the pre-245AA policy persisted  notwithstanding
    the  introduction  of  paragraph  245AA,  Mr  Momoh  acknowledged   the
    difficulty  presented  by  paragraph  2  of  the  headnote  in  Durrani
    (Entrepreneurs: bank letters; evidential flexibility) [2014] [UKUT] 295
    (IAC), which states - "The question of whether the policy exists is one
    of  fact.  There  is  no  evidence  that  some  policy  on   evidential
    flexibility, independent and free standing of paragraph 245AA, survived
    the introduction of that paragraph in the immigration rules."

15. The Judge - rationally and sustainably in  my  judgement  -  identified
    that the defect in the third party declaration  was  not  of  a  nature
    encompassed by the terms  of  paragraph  245AA(b)(i)-(iii).  Mr  Momoh,
    however, argued that there had been an  amendment  to  paragraph  245AA
    incorporating sub-subparagraph (b)(iv) - "A document does  not  contain
    all of the specified information" - and the Appellant was  entitled  to
    the benefit of that provision. Ms Isherwood, in turn, pointed out  that
    the amendment dated from 1 October 2013 and accordingly  did  not  have
    effect at the  time  of  either  the  Appellant's  application  or  the
    Respondent's decision.

16. I accept Mr Isherwood's submission in this regard and  reject  that  of
    Appellant. Accordingly I find that the  Appellant's  challenge  to  the
    Judge's assessment of evidential flexibility fails.

17. In any event I am dubious that the failure to provide  the  appropriate
    signatures on a document is equivalent to  a  document  not  containing
    "specified information". It seems to me to be a defect of  a  different
    sort from the omission of information. Accordingly,  even  if  it  were
    otherwise in respect of the applicability of 245AA(b)(iv), I would  not
    be minded  to  conclude  that  the  Respondent  was  thereby  under  an
    obligation to consider requesting the correct documents.

18. In all such circumstances, notwithstanding the error of approach on the
    part of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in respect of  Appendix  P,  with
    reference to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal's, Courts and Enforcement
    Act 2007, I determine that it would not be appropriate to set aside the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal in respect of the Immigration Rules
    because the sustainable  conclusion  in  respect  of  the  third  party
    declaration is sufficient to defeat the Appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Rules in any event.

19. However, in light of it being common ground between  the  parties  that
    the Judge erred in respect of section 47, I do set aside  the  decision
    in this regard and remake it, dismissing the  appeal  in  this  respect
    also.

Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained no material error  of
    law in respect  of  the  decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  and
    accordingly the decision stands.

21. However, the First-tier Tribunal did err in respect of the  section  47
    removal decision. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside
    in this regard, and I remake the decision. The removal decision was  in
    accordance with the law and the appeal is dismissed.

22.  The  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  in  respect  of  Article  8  is
    unchallenged, and the appeal remains dismissed in this regard.

23. The appeal of Mr Khan is dismissed on all grounds.
