                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal issued on 18 June 2013 allowing  an  appeal  by  Mr
    Wenhao Xu against the decision of 15 March 2013 refusing  to  vary  his
    leave to remain as a Tier 4  Student  and  to  remove  him  by  way  of
    directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006.  In this determination I will refer to the parties as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Wenhao Xu as the appellant  and  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is  a  citizen  of  China  born  in  June  1992.   On  13
    September 2012 he first arrived in the UK with  a  visa  as  a  Tier  4
    Student valid until 21 January 2013.  On 17 January 2013 he applied for
    further leave to remain in the same capacity.  The respondent  accepted
    that he could meet the requirements of Appendix A (Attributes) but  not
    of Appendix C (Maintenance/Funds).

3.   As the appellant was studying in Inner London he had to  show  that  he
    had the required funds to cover the fees for the first academic year of
    his course at Coventry University and have funds of  �1,000  per  month
    for nine months.   The information before the respondent was that   his
    course fees were �10,375 of which he had made two  payments  of  �3,459
    and �5,666 totalling �9,125.  He was therefore required to show that he
    was in possession of �10,250, made up of �9,000 for his maintenance and
    �1,250 for outstanding course fees.

4.   However, the bank statements submitted by the  appellant  covering  the
    period from 14 December 2012 to 10 January 2013 showed that  between  3
    January and 10 January 2013 he  was  in  possession  of  no  more  than
    �10,082  so  falling  short  by  �168.   As  he  could  not  meet   the
    requirements of the rules, his application was refused.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The appellant appealed against this decision and in  his  grounds  said
    that he had paid in full his tuition fees and had had more than  �9,000
    in his bank account for  over  28  days.  In  these  circumstances  the
    respondent was wrong, so it is argued, to conclude that he did not have
    the level of funds required.  He asked for the appeal to be  determined
    without a hearing and submitted a witness statement to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in which he says that his tuition fees  were  supposed  to  be
    �10,375 but he was awarded a discount of �1,250 when he paid  his  fees
    in full.  His discounted tuition fee  was  therefore  �9,125.   He  had
    submitted  the  receipt  for  his  payment  when   he   submitted   the
    application.   With  his  statement  he  enclosed  a  letter  from  his
    university to confirm the discount.  The appellant then said in para  6
    of his statement:

         "I didn't know my university didn't update my CAS  in  the  system.
         Since I have paid the full tuition fees and only  evidence  that  I
         have had is my receipts which I had  submitted.  My  receipts  show
         that I have paid �9,125 in total, there was no  reason  for  me  to
         just leave �1,250 outstanding balance.  And I didn't  know  that  I
         needed to  request  a  letter  to  confirm  the  discount  from  my
         university and UK Border Agency didn't  contact  my  university  to
         confirm my fee status before they refused me as well.   I  think  I
         was innocent in this application and particularly was my first visa
         renewal in the UK.  I just thought my receipts were enough to prove
         that I didn't owe any tuition fees."

6.   The judge referred to the letter from  Coventry  University  confirming
    that the discount had been  awarded and then went on to deal  with  the
    appeal in the following way:

         "8.      This appears to be a case where the judgment of the  Court
             of Appeal in Miah v Secretary of State for the Home Department
             [2012] EWCA Civ 261 applies.   The  near-  miss  principle  at
             least arguably opened following the judgment of the  Court  of
             Appeal in Pankina and Others [2010] EWCA  Civ  719  no  longer
             applies.  The near miss principle contended for  in  Miah  was
             considered not to be the same as the de minimis principle.  If
             a departure from the rule is truly de  minimis,  the  rule  is
             considered to have been  complied with.  In  my  judgment  the
             shortfall was truly de minimis and I find the Immigration Rule
             was met by the appellant's evidence."

     On this basis the appeal was allowed and a fee award was  made  on  the
    basis that the appellant had succeeded in the appeal  and  should  have
    been granted leave to remain when he applied.

The Grounds and Submissions

7.   The respondent was granted permission to appeal on the  basis  that  it
    was arguable that the judge erred in law, having acknowledged that  the
    appellant did not meet the requirements of the  rules  in  relation  to
    maintenance/funds, by allowing it on the near miss  principle  contrary
    to the guidance set out in Miah.  The grounds argue that the  appellant
    had not met the requirements of the rules and that the  respondent  had
    been  correct to refuse the application.

8.   At the hearing before me Mr Tarlow adopted the grounds making it  clear
    that the respondent's complaint was that the  judge  was  in  substance
    applying a near miss argument by wrongly describing  the  shortfall  in
    the funds as falling within the de minimis principle.  He accepted that
    the evidence submitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  if  correct  would
    indicate that the appellant could have  met  the  requirements  of  the
    rules save for the failure to submit all the  required  information  at
    the date of application.  However, the  information  submitted  and  in
    particular the CAS indicated that the fees were �10,375 and  there  was
    no indication that any discount would be applied.

The Error of Law

9.   The application for further leave to remain by the appellant  was  made
    under the points-based scheme and he is required  to  submit  with  his
    application all the evidence he  wishes  to  rely  on.   That  evidence
    showed that his fees for his next academic year  amounted  to  �10,375.
    The respondent gave him credit for the payments of  �3,459  and  �5,666
    but under the rules the appellant needed to show that he had �9,000 for
    his maintenance plus the balance of his fees.  He therefore  failed  to
    meet the requirements of the rules in that his bank balance fell  below
    �10,250 for the period 3-10 January 2013.

10.  He submitted in support of his appeal further evidence to show that  as
    he had paid his fees in full, they were discounted to �9,125 but  there
    was no evidence to that effect submitted  with  his  application.   The
    appellant was not able to rely on further evidence  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal by  reason  of  the  provisions  of  s.85A(3)(b)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002

11.  The position therefore before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  the
    appellant had failed to meet the requirements of the rules by �168  for
    seven days from 3-10 January 2013.  This failure cannot be  categorised
    as de minimis. In Miah, Stanley Burnton LJ held that  the  approach  in
    Mongoto [2005] EWCA Civ 751 and Rudi [2007] EWCA  Civ  1326  should  be
    preferred to Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 719 on the issue of whether  there
    could be a near miss approach to the  immigration  rules.   As  Stanley
    Burnton LJ said in [25] of Miah, once an apparently bright line rule is
    disregarded as subject to a near-miss penumbra and a decision  is  made
    in favour of a near-miss applicant on  that  basis,  another  applicant
    will appear claiming to be a near-miss to that near-miss and that  will
    be a steep slope away from predictable rules, the efficacy and  utility
    of which would be undermined.

12.  The rules require an applicant to provide information about his  course
    fees and maintenance and to  demonstrate  his  ability  to  meet  those
    requirements by the submission of specific documents.  On the  evidence
    supplied by  the  appellant  with  his  application,  the  respondent's
    decision was in accordance with the rules.  There was no  proper  basis
    on which an appeal against that decision could be allowed by treating a
    short-fall of �168 as de minimis. To do so undermines the  requirements
    of the rules. I must allow the respondent's appeal against the decision
    relating to the variation of leave to remain.

13.  This is a case where the removal decision made on 15 March 2013 was  in
    the same document as the decision to  vary  leave  to  remain  and  was
    therefore not in accordance with the law for the reasons set out by the
    Court of Appeal in Secretary of State v Ahmadi  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  512.
    The wording of s.47 has subsequently been  amended  by  the  Crime  and
    Courts Act 2013 but that post-dates the decision made in  this  appeal.
    It is open  to  the  appellant  to  make  further  submissions  to  the
    respondent on his particular circumstances including the issues  raised
    in this appeal before that decision is re-made by the respondent.

Decision

14.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and I set the decision  aside.   I
    re-make the decision by dismissing the appellant's appeal  against  the
    decision refusing to vary his leave to remain but I  allow  his  appeal
    against the decision to remove him on the basis that that decision  was
    not in accordance with the law.
