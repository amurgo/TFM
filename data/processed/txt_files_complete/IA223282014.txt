               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



For the Appellant:     Ms P Kaur, of Five Star (International) Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals against the determination by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Kempton, promulgated on 5th August 2014,  dismissing  his  appeal
    against refusal of an application as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    under the points-based system.

 2. The Appellant's  grounds  are  that  the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal
    primarily because she found there to be no evidence that  the  required
    funds of  �50,000  were  available  to  the  Appellant.   She  said  at
    paragraph 20:

         "I am not at all satisfied that the main issue, namely that of  the
         funds of �50,000 has been at all adequately addressed.   I  do  not
         see any bank statement or evidence the funds in an account  or  the
         two deposits as stated ... The Appellant simply  has  not  put  his
         money where his mouth is".

    The grounds say that copies of two deposits  from  the  Bank  of  India
    totalling over the required amount  were  in  the  bundles  before  the
    judge, were spoken to in an affidavit from the Appellant's father,  and
    were accompanied by a letter from the bank stating that the funds  were
    freely available for investment in the UK.

 3. Mr Mullen acknowledged that copies of all those items were  before  the
    judge.  He exhibited the originals, which are on the Respondent's file.
     He acknowledged that the Appellant thereby  met  the  decisive  points
    held against him by the judge.  He also acknowledged that although  the
    Respondent's refusal decision found  other  reasons  for  refusing  the
    application, there is in this case no response under  Rule  24  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunals)  Rules  2008  relying  upon  the
    grounds on which the Respondent  was  unsuccessful  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 4. In those circumstances, the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    falls to be set aside, and the following decision is  substituted:  the
    appeal, as brought by the Appellant  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  is
    allowed under the Immigration Rules.

 5. No order for anonymity, nor fee order, has been requested or made.
