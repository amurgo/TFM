Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr F Farhat of Counsel instructed by Gulbenkian
Andonian
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ross promulgated on 28 November 2016 dismissing the Appellant's  appeal
    against a decision of the Respondent dated  27  April  2015  to  refuse
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


2.   The Appellant is a national of Uganda born  on  9  October  1970.   She
    claims to have entered the United Kingdom on 5 May 2005 with six months
    leave to enter as a visitor.  She thereafter became an overstayer.   On
    18 January 2012 the Appellant made an application for leave  to  remain
    using form FLR(M) on the basis of her  marriage  to  Mr  Saturday  Mark
    Okpuru, a national of Nigeria born on 7 April 1953, who it was said had
    been living in the United Kingdom for a  period  in  excess  of  twenty
    years and  had  the  status  of  a  settled  person.   There  are  some
    references in the materials before me to  Mr  Okpuru  being  a  British
    citizen, but the evidence appears to  demonstrate  that  he  has  never
    applied for British citizenship by way of naturalisation  or  otherwise
    and has retained his citizenship of Nigeria.  Be  that  as  it  may  it
    seems to me nothing material turns on his nationality so  much  as  the
    fact that he is a settled person: the Appellant made an application  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of  a  settled  person,  the
    couple having married in a church ceremony on 30 June 2010.  It is said
    that they had been dating as a couple since January 2007 and cohabiting
    from April 2008.


3.   In the application form at section 8 it was indicated that neither  the
    Appellant nor her husband were working - albeit they  stated  outgoings
    of rent of ï¿½700 per month.  In the boxes provided at section 8.6 it was
    indicated that the Appellant's partner was in receipt of  public  finds
    by way of disability living allowance.


4.   There appears to have been some unexplained delay in the processing  of
    the Appellant's  application  to  such  an  extent  that  her  advisers
    initiated judicial review proceedings which were settled by  way  of  a
    consent order on the basis that the  Respondent  undertook  to  make  a
    prompt  decision  in  respect  of  her  application.   The  Appellant's
    application was then refused on 27 April 2015 for reasons set out in  a
    'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') of that date  with  reference  to
    paragraphs 286, 284(iv), 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, and  also  by
    reference to the so called 'partner  route'  under  Appendix  FM  -  in
    particular paragraph EX1 of Appendix FM.


5.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC. The appeal  was  dismissed  for  the
    reasons set out in the Decision of Judge Ross.


6.   The Appellant then sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was  granted  on  25  July  2017  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Robertson.  The Appellant essentially raised two grounds of  challenge.
    Judge Robertson considered that the second of those grounds  had  "some
    arguable merit" and that in the circumstances  ground  one  would  also
    need to be considered.  The second of those grounds  is  pleaded  under
    the heading "Benefits, burden on taxpayer and the section 117 statutory
    considerations".   The  first  ground  of  challenge  is  stylised   as
    "reasoning as to insurmountable obstacles  -  Shahzad  (sufficiency  of
    reasons: set aside) [2013]".


7.   It is perhaps convenient given the approach of Judge Robertson to  turn
    to the second of the grounds of challenge first.


8.   Judge Robertson identified in the grant of permission  to  appeal  that
    the challenge to the Judge's consideration of the section 117 statutory
    considerations, and the question of receipt  or  otherwise  of  welfare
    benefits,  potentially  impacted  upon  the  Judge's  consideration  of
    proportionality.  The key passages in  the  Judge's  Decision  in  this
    regard are paragraphs 24 and 25:

         "24. In reaching a decision I must take into account  section  117B
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.   This  states
             that the maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
             the public interest.  It is in  the  public  interest  and  in
             particular the interest of the economic wellbeing  of  the  UK
             that persons who seek to remain  in  the  UK  are  financially
             independent because such persons are not a burden on taxpayers
             and are better able to integrate into society.  Little  weight
             should be given to private life or a relationship formed  with
             a qualifying partner if it is established by  a  person  at  a
             time when the person is in the UK unlawfully.   Little  weight
             should be given to a private life established by a person at a
             time when the person's immigration status is precarious.


          25. Conducting the balancing exercise and applying  section  117B,
             although the appellant  and  her  husband  have  a  subsisting
             relationship this relationship was established at a time  when
             the appellant was not in the UK lawfully, and they  must  have
             known when  they  had  entered  into  the  marriage  that  the
             appellant was not entitled to live in  the  UK.   I  therefore
             consider that applying the words of the section,  I  can  give
             little weight to the relationship.  In addition the  appellant
             and her husband live on benefits,  they  are  not  financially
             self-supporting, and although they can point to the fact  that
             it would be very difficult for the appellant  to  go  back  to
             Uganda, and that she would have a  much  better  life  if  she
             remained in the UK, her remaining in the UK  will  potentially
             be a burden to the taxpayer, and she is not entitled to any of
             the benefits of living in a welfare state, such as free health
             care, because she is not a  British  citizen.   There  are  no
             children under the age of 18 to consider in  this  case  which
             might have made a difference.   I  also  appreciate  that  her
             husband is not of Ugandan ethnicity but was born  in  Nigeria.
             He has said that he will not leave  the  UK,  but  that  is  a
             decision for him.  I  therefore  consider  that  although  the
             decision clearly interferes with her family and private  life,
             the interference is proportionate  and  therefore  the  appeal
             must fail".




9.   The challenge in  this  regard  very  much  focuses  upon  the  Judge's
    references to the receipt of benefits.  This  is  both  emphasised  and
    undermined by paragraph 22 of the Grounds of Appeal: emphasised because
    it alleges that the Judge "refers to the Appellant claiming benefits to
    which she is not entitled"; undermined because, in my judgement, it  is
    wrongly premised in so asserting - as will be seen in due course I  can
    identify nothing in the decision that amounts to a finding by the Judge
    that the Appellant had herself at any point made a claim  for  benefits
    whilst in the UK.  Otherwise the grounds of challenge essentially focus
    on the fact that it  was  the  Appellant's  husband  who  was  claiming
    benefits, that those were  benefits  to  which  he  was  entitled,  and
    therefore these were benefits that he received in his own right.


10.  It seems to me that that line of challenge  essentially  misunderstands
    or misconceives  what  it  is  that  the  Judge  was  saying  in  these
    paragraphs in respect  of  the  public  interest  considerations  under
    section 117B.


11.  It is perhaps helpful to set out  in  particular  the  public  interest
    consideration under section 117B(3), which is in these terms:

         "It is in the public interest and in particular in the interest  of
         the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom that persons who  seek
         to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom   are   financially
         independent because such persons:


         (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and


         (b)  are better able to integrate into society".


    It may be seen that the emphasis  here  is  on  an  applicant  being  a
    financially independent person. The reasons why this is  considered  to
    be an important public consideration are then explained - "because...".
    In the context of this particular case, where it might be said that the
    Appellant had already to some extent integrated into  UK  society,  the
    particular emphasis was on the potential burden on taxpayers.


12.  If the observations of the Judge are considered against this  statutory
    framework, it seems to me clear that there is nothing in what  he  says
    that is factually inaccurate, and there is nothing in what he says that
    offends  against  the  imperative  to  have  regard   to   the   public
    considerations itemised in section 117B.  It is -  as  Mr  Farhat  very
    fairly acknowledged in the  course  of  submissions  and  discussion  -
    entirely accurate to say that the Appellant and  her  husband  live  on
    benefits:  it  may  well  be  that  they  are  benefits  to  which  the
    Appellant's husband is entitled, but nonetheless it is  the  case  that
    their financial support is essentially that  garnered  by  way  of  his
    entitlement to benefits.  Neither the Appellant nor her husband can  be
    said to be financially  self-supporting.   It  follows,  recalling  the
    wording of section 117B(3), that the Appellant is not a person  who  is
    financially impendent.  To that extent it  is  open  to  the  Judge  to
    conclude - in accordance with the reasoning set out in section  117B(3)
    - that the Appellant, not being financially independent and essentially
    being supported by way of her  husband's  benefits,  is  potentially  a
    burden to taxpayers. If she is not self-supporting then as soon as  she
    seeks to access any public services - for example healthcare  services,
    which it was acknowledged she has already accessed whilst in the  UK  -
    as a person who has no history of employment and has not demonstrated a
    propensity to take employment in the United Kingdom at a rate where she
    would be a net tax contributor, she becomes a burden on taxpayers.   To
    this extent it seems to me that the Judge has correctly considered  the
    public interest consideration  under  section  117B(3),  and  has  made
    unimpugnable observations and comments on it in  the  context  of  this
    particular case.


13.  It is to be noted that there is no challenge before  me  to  any  other
    aspect of the proportionality assessment conducted  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.  The  challenge  to  the  Decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal accordingly fails in this regard.


14.  In respect of the other ground of challenge,  it  is  argued  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge has failed  to  offer  any  reasons,  or  any
    adequate  reasons,  for  his  conclusion  that  there  would   not   be
    'insurmountable obstacles' within the  meaning  of  paragraph  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM as defined under paragraph EX2.


15.  In this context it is instructive to note what was  being  advanced  by
    the Appellant and her partner in  respect  of  potential  obstacles  to
    relocation.  These matters are set out in the Judge's decision  in  the
    course of recording  the  testimony  of  each  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband, both in respect of their written  statements  and  their  oral
    evidence.  For example, in particular  the  Appellant  is  recorded  as
    relying on the fact that "she did not feel good about the idea of going
    to Nigeria with her husband, she did not understand the  language,  and
    she might be tortured"  (paragraph  6).   Reference  is  also  made  to
    "cultural problems"  if  a  person  marries  another  national:  it  is
    asserted "They are hated".  Reference is also made to  the  Appellant's
    husband's health condition there being evidence before the  Judge  that
    he had diabetes, high blood pressure, sinus problems, and a history  of
    cardiac problems.  However,  Mr  Okpuru  was  asked  about  his  health
    conditions he essentially indicated that although he had a  history  of
    ill health he was currently well: "He was asked about  his  health  and
    said that his health was fine and that  he  was  well"  (paragraph  9).
    Further he was asked about his history of having had a heart attack  to
    which he responded that "he had been operated on and that  he  was  now
    well.  He takes medication when he feels like it, this is  to  do  with
    his heart.  His diabetes improves if he goes to a gym"  (paragraph  9).
    Nonetheless the Appellant's husband expressed the view  that  he  could
    not go and live in Uganda "because in his culture he could  not  go  to
    his wife's country.  He said that in his culture men marry women, women
    do not marry men" (paragraph 9).


16.  It seems to me that the Judge took into account the substance of  these
    matters in considering the issue of insurmountable obstacles.   In  any
    event it is to be noted  that  these  matters  in  the  main  part  are
    essentially unsupported assertions, or expressions of concern, made  by
    the Appellant and her husband.  Mr Farhat acknowledges that  there  was
    nothing by way of independent  supporting  evidence  to  reinforce  the
    substance of the concerns expressed.  Specifically  there  was  nothing
    before the First-tier Tribunal to establish that there was  any  degree
    of animosity in Nigeria to Ugandans or to Nigerians who marry people of
    other nationalities,  and  there  was  nothing  by  way  of  supporting
    evidence to indicate any difficulty  for  Nigerians  in  Uganda.   Nor,
    significantly, was there anything before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    respect of the availability of healthcare in either Nigeria or Uganda.


17.   The  Judge  addresses  the  issue  of  insurmountable   obstacles   at
    paragraphs 17-19.  At paragraph 17 he says this:

         "The term insurmountable obstacles is defined in EX2 and means very
         significant difficulties which would be faced by the  applicant  or
         their partner in continuing their family life together outside  the
         UK and which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
         hardship to the applicant or her partner".


    That is in essence an accurate paraphrasing of the definition in  EX.2,
    and to that extent a wholly unobjectionable self-direction  as  to  the
    applicable test.  The Judge continues at paragraph 18 and 19  in  these
    terms:


         "18. I therefore have to consider the effect on the  appellant  and
             her partner in continuing their family life  outside  the  UK.
             The first point to consider is that the appellant  comes  from
             Uganda whereas her husband comes from Nigeria.  Both  of  them
             have lived in the UK for many years.  The Appellant's  husband
             suffers from health problem although he now says  that  he  is
             fine and the doctors seem to indicate that  his  condition  is
             not a problem provided  he  takes  his  medication.   Although
             there are children in the UK these children are  the  children
             of the appellant's husband and according to the appellant  she
             does not see anything of them since they got married in 2014.


          19. I therefore consider that although I accept that there will be
             considerable difficulties if the Appellant were to  return  to
             Uganda either with or without her husband I  do  not  consider
             the difficulties could be defined as insurmountable  obstacles
             within the definition I have set out above.  Her father  still
             lives in Uganda and her children also live there although  she
             has little contact with them.  She would obviously have a much
             more comfortable life if she remained in the UK with  all  the
             benefits of a welfare state but she is  not  British  and  not
             entitled to these benefits.  I  therefore  consider  that  the
             appellant cannot succeed on the basis of the Rules".




18.  In my  judgment  the  references  at  paragraph  18  to  the  different
    nationalities of the Appellant and her husband and to  the  Appellant's
    health problems are a clear and obvious  echo  of  those  concerns  and
    matters raised by each of the Appellant and her husband in  their  oral
    evidence at paragraphs 6-9 as indicated above.  It seems to me that the
    Judge is in terms  turning  his  mind  to  those  matters  advanced  as
    providing potential obstacles to relocation to  continue  their  mutual
    family life outside the United Kingdom.  It also seems to me  that  the
    Judge was perfectly entitled to conclude, as he states in  terms,  that
    such matters whilst presenting considerable difficulties did not  reach
    the definition of  'insurmountable  obstacles'  as  identified  in  his
    paragraph 17. I can see no error of approach on the part of  the  Judge
    to the question of insurmountable obstacles.  In my judgment he reached
    an entirely sustainable conclusion adequately reasoned.

19.  In those circumstances I find nothing of substance  in  either  of  the
    grounds of challenge upon which permission to appeal was granted.
