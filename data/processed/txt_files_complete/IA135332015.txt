                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Dominica born on 26th January  1969.   He
    appeals against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes
    sitting at Sheldon Court Birmingham on 21st August 2015  in  which  the
    Judge dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the
    Respondent dated 23rd March 2015.  That  decision  was  to  refuse  the
    Appellant's application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom under
    human rights considerations. The Appellant claimed that the refusal  of
    his application breached this country's obligations under  Appendix  FM
    and paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and Article 8  (right  to
    respect for private and family life)  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom on a visitor's  visa  on  11th
    May 2008 valid until 11th November 2008.   The  Appellant  subsequently
    joined the Territorial Army and made two unsuccessful applications  for
    leave to remain in 2008 and 2010.  The Appellant  further  applied  for
    leave to remain this time as a spouse in 2011 but this too was rejected
    by the Respondent.  On  15th  September  2014  the  Appellant  made  an
    application the  refusal  of  which  has  given  rise  to  the  present
    proceedings.

The Decision at First Instance

3.   At paragraphs 7 and  following  the  Judge  succinctly  summarised  the
    nature of the Appellant's argument that he should be granted  leave  to
    remain against the background of his service in the  Territorial  Army.
    The Judge wrote:

         "7.  The Appellant relies on his background as a member of  the  TA
             as justifying consideration of his application  for  leave  to
             remain as a spouse when other preconditions cannot be met.  It
             is  not  suggested  that  the   Appellant   could   meet   the
             requirements of Appendix AF in the  Immigration  Rules  or  of
             paragraphs 276O as that requires four years' service  with  HM
             Forces and that must mean the regulars  it  is  not  suggested
             that the Appellant was subject to service law for four  years.



         8.   In the Armed Forces Act 2006  which  applied  to  his  earlier
             applications and the Armed Forces Act  2011  a  member  of  HM
             Forces is defined as a member of the  regular  forces  in  the
             case of the army is a member of the regular army.  By  Section
             8(4) of the Immigration Act 1971 and in Home  Office  guidance
             on the point a member of the TA as a reservist is only  exempt
             from immigration control when subject to service law.

         9.   At page C10 of the Home Office bundle in  a  letter  from  the
             Appellant's representatives of  9th  October  2014  there  are
             extracts from the relevant IDIs.  It is clear from the section
             dealing with a TA member that an individual  serving  on  duty
             such as a weekend exercise would be  exempt  from  immigration
             control but on completion of  his  service  would  resume  his
             previous status.  Although it was thought that there would not
             be many who had overstayed and who would return  to  being  an
             overstayer that possibility was explicitly contemplated.

         10.   It  appears  that  simply  being  a  member  of  the  TA   is
             insufficient to bring an  individual  within  the  definitions
             that apply once an individual had been  discharged  then  they
             would  not  be  subject  to  service  law  at  any  point  and
             accordingly would not be exempt from immigration control.  The
             Appellant has not had leave conferred on any basis  under  the
             Immigration Rules.

         11.  Reference was made to an historic injustice however it is  not
             clear what that would be.   The  Appellant  was  not  sent  on
             active service and while reference was made to Rules  that  in
             certain circumstances might assist a TA soldier other than the
             Rules discussed above I was not directed to any other than the
             Rules that confer exemption only when subject to service  law.



         12.  As the Appellant's applications that were made when he was  in
             the TA were rejected and there was no  successful  application
             or challenge in the courts I cannot find  that  the  Appellant
             benefited from the Rules that applies to members of the  armed
             forces.  It has not been shown that his exclusion  from  those
             Rules is unfair or amounts to an injustice, there  is  nothing
             to suggest that his position can be equated  to  that  of  the
             Gurkhas."

4.   The Appellant left the Territorial Army on 19th November  2013  at  his
    own request.  His application for leave to remain made on  7th  January
    2014 was made out of time under paragraph 276 as it was made more  than
    28 days after his discharge.  The application for leave which forms the
    subject of the present appeal was made  nearly  ten  months  after  his
    discharge.  The Appellant had only been in  the  United  Kingdom  since
    2008 and could not meet the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE.   Even
    assuming his presence in the United Kingdom had been lawful  throughout
    he was still three years or so short of the minimum time required under
    the paragraph.  The Appellant had shown himself to be adaptable  having
    moved from Dominica to the Dutch Antilles and from there to the  United
    Kingdom and then establishing himself in  the  Territorial  Army.   The
    Appellant had grown up in Dominica and there could not be  said  to  be
    very significant obstacles to the Appellant's return there.

5.   At paragraphs 17 to 26 the Judge dealt with the  Appellant's  claim  to
    have a family life.  Dealing first with Appendix  FM  the  Judge  noted
    that paragraph EX.1 was not a standalone provision it was only  engaged
    where other requirements  had  been  complied  with.   The  Appellant's
    fianc�e told the Judge that she was in a new  job  and  would  be  paid
    �15,100 a year which plus pension would be a total  income  of  �16,900
    per annum.  The Judge was nevertheless apparently  satisfied  that  the
    financial  requirements  were  met  and  that  the  Appellant  met  the
    suitability requirements and  would  meet  the  English  language  test
    requirement.

6.   The Appellant met his partner in 2009 and had been  in  a  relationship
    living together since 2010.  Both the Appellant and  his  partner  were
    aware that the Appellant had  been  in  the  United  Kingdom  illegally
    becoming an overstayer after his visit visa expired.  The  relationship
    appeared to be genuine and subsisting and the Appellant's  partner  had
    never been to Dominica.  However the Judge could not  find  that  there
    were insurmountable obstacles that could  not  be  surmounted  or  that
    would entail very serious hardship.  The Judge rejected the claim under
    Appendix FM EX.1.  The Appellant could return to Dominica and  make  an
    application for entry clearance as a partner or fianc�e  in  the  usual
    manner supported by the required evidence.  The Judge acknowledged that
    this was not addressed as an issue in Appendix FM but it  was  for  the
    Appellant to show that it would disproportionately interfere  with  his
    Article 8 rights to expect  him  to  return  to  Dominica  to  make  an
    application from there.

7.   Such a separation would impose a  financial  burden  but  much  of  the
    Appellant's time in the United Kingdom was spent as an overstayer.   By
    Section 117B(4) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    little weight  could  be  given  to  a  relationship  formed  when  the
    Appellant was in the United Kingdom illegally.  That was the case  here
    and both the Appellant and his fianc�e were aware of the  difficulties.
    It would not be disproportionate to expect the Appellant to  leave  the
    UK and make a proper application in the usual way.  The Judge concluded
    at paragraph 26:

         "Article 8 is not a bypass to the Immigration Rules and the  Rules
         form the starting point for  the  assessment  of  any  application.
         This is not a case where  the  Appellant  is  in  a  situation  not
         contemplated by the Rules, he is in a  situation  foreseen  by  the
         Rules but where he cannot meet the requirements including those  of
         paragraph EX.1.  There is nothing in the Appellant's  circumstances
         that would justify granting leave to remain outside the Immigration
         Rules and accordingly the appeal cannot succeed".

The Onward Appeal

8.    The  Appellant  appealed  against  this  decision  arguing  that   the
    Appellant's case should have succeeded outside  the  Immigration  Rules
    due to the unusual and  exceptional  circumstances  in  the  case.   If
    proper regard was not had to the circumstances it  would  lead  to  the
    conclusion that the army had unlawfully taken into service  an  illegal
    immigrant.  The Judge had made a  number  of  mistakes.  The  financial
    limit was �18,600 and would not be met by an income of �16,900  as  the
    Judge had concluded.  Members  of  the  reserved  forces  such  as  the
    Territorial Army could not normally apply for leave to enter or  remain
    solely on the basis of their reserve service but the Judge  had  failed
    to appreciate this.  From 11th July 2013 a person was required to  have
    five years legal residency in the UK at the time they applied  to  join
    the army.  However there was no such  requirement  when  the  Appellant
    applied to  join  the  Territorial  Army.   The  Judge  had  failed  to
    appreciate the historical injustice in the case.  There  then  followed
    at paragraph 4 of the grounds a lengthy recitation of the IDIs relating
    to the armed forces which the  Judge  had  already  summarised  in  his
    determination (see above paragraph 3).

9.   The grounds complained that the Respondent had taken almost  two  years
    to reply to the 2011 application and  that  it  was  this  delay  which
    contributed to  the  Appellant's  stay  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Appellant had not been given  a  confirmed  exemption  as  should  have
    occurred.  The Respondent had rejected the Appellant's application  for
    leave to remain on the basis that no fee was submitted when in fact  no
    fee was payable.

10.  The Judge erred in considering that the Appellant needed to be sent  on
    active service before an historic injustice could arise.   The  grounds
    highlighted paragraph 5.2 of the Home Office  guidance  that  whilst  a
    person was serving on  duty  in  the  Territorial  Army  he  should  be
    regarded as exempt from control.  There was substantial evidence of the
    Appellant's service in the Territorial Army submitted to the  Judge  at
    first  instance.   Paragraph  9  of  the  grounds  listed  these  items
    including a letter from the army,  payslips,  vaccination  certificate,
    army ID card, annual appraisals and other  documents.   The  historical
    unfairness affected the Appellant's circumstances in both  his  private
    and family life.

11.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers on 2nd February  2016.   He  refused
    permission to appeal finding that whilst this might be an unusual  case
    it was not exceptional.  Part-time army service between 2008  and  2013
    could not provide a proper basis for the grant of leave to remain.  The
    Judge's apparent error regarding the amount  required  to  satisfy  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM was an error  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant and could have made no difference to the result.  In  reality
    the grounds amounted to little more than an attempt to quarrel with the
    conclusion that the Article 8 case had not been made out.

12.  The Appellant renewed his application for permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  The Sponsor's income of �16,900  represented  a  near-
    miss as contemplated in the case of SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387.
    That a case involves a  near-miss  cannot  mean  that  that  is  wholly
    irrelevant to the balancing exercise required  under  Article  8.   The
    renewed application for permission to appeal came on the papers  before
    Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Finch  on  26th  February  2016.   In  granting
    permission to appeal she wrote:

         "First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes was in error in paragraph 26  of
         his decision when he found  that  it  was  not  a  case  where  the
         Appellant is in a situation not  contemplated  by  the  Rules.   As
         explained in Chen [2015] UKUT 189 whether the temporary  separation
         caused by an individual within a  couple  returning  to  apply  for
         entry clearance amounted to a breach of Article 8 was not addressed
         in Appendix FM.  Therefore  the  First-tier  Tribunal  should  have
         considered the appeal outside the Immigration Rules and when  doing
         so should have taken into account the Appellant's  service  in  the
         Territorial Army.  As a consequence  I  find  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  did  make  arguable  errors  of  law  when
         dismissing the Appellant's appeal and  that  permission  to  appeal
         should be granted."

The Hearing Before Me

13.  The Appellant's solicitor indicated she  relied  substantially  on  the
    documents submitted to the Tribunal seeking permission to appeal.   The
    Appellant's case was not one that could be considered by the Rules  and
    therefore discretion should have  been  exercised  in  the  Appellant's
    favour.  The historical  injustice  was  set  out  in  the  Appellant's
    statement and the skeleton arguments.  The rejections of  his  previous
    applications were not justified.  All the Appellant needed to do was to
    send his passport and  a  letter  from  the  army  but  the  Respondent
    rejected the application because no fee was provided when  no  fee  was
    payable.  It was conceded that the facts  of  the  Gurkha  cases  which
    dealt with historic injustice were totally different but the point  was
    the same.

14.  In reply the Presenting Officer commented  that  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Finch appeared to be under a misapprehension that the Judge was unaware
    of the historical background but in fact the Judge was perfectly  aware
    of those issues.  This was not a compelling  case  to  go  outside  the
    Rules.  The Chen point was that it was for the Appellant  to  show  why
    separation from his partner while he returned to obtain leave to  enter
    was disproportionate.  Given the Judge's finding that the  partner  was
    earning �16,900 it was  far  from  clear  that  entry  clearance  would
    automatically be granted and therefore it was reasonable to expect  the
    Appellant to return to apply for entry clearance from Dominica.

15.  In conclusion it was argued on the Appellant's behalf that no case  law
    had been cited  in  the  decision.   The  manner  in  which  the  Judge
    considered the proportionality exercise was flawed.  The  issue  should
    be looked at in the round instead of being split into  different  parts
    of the determination.  There  were  exceptional  circumstances  in  the
    Appellant's favour and the appeal should have been allowed.

Findings

16.  The Appellant's argument as to historical  injustice  is  not  entirely
    easy to follow (as the Judge pointed out  at  first  instance)  but  it
    appears to be based on the premise that if the  Appellant  applied  for
    leave to  remain  whilst  serving  in  the  Territorial  Army  such  an
    application should  have  been  granted  because  he  was  exempt  from
    immigration control at that time.  I agree with the submission made  to
    me by the Presenting Officer that the Judge at first instance was aware
    of that argument and took some time and care in  his  determination  to
    deal with it.  I have set out verbatim above the relevant extract  from
    the determination which shows that the Judge  was  aware  of  both  the
    statutory background and  the  IDIs  issued  by  the  Respondent  which
    governed this situation.

17.  It did not follow  that  because  the  Appellant  was  serving  in  the
    Territorial Army that any application he might make to  the  Respondent
    must be determined in his favour.  The Judge was careful to explain the
    difference between service in the Territorial Army and service  in  the
    regular army and what that meant in terms of exemption from immigration
    control. I do not take Upper Tribunal Judge Finch's decision  to  grant
    permission  to  appeal  to  be  a  criticism  of  that  aspect  of  the
    determination.  Rather I take Upper Tribunal Judge Finch's decision  to
    mean that the Article 8 claim had to be looked at in  the  round  given
    the fact that the Appellant had served this country in the capacity  of
    a Territorial Army recruit.  However it has to be said that  the  Judge
    was aware of that point as well and also dealt with that.   Service  in
    the Territorial Army could not be equated with service in  the  regular
    army for the reasons given by the Judge who illustrated the  difference
    by pointed out that the Appellant had not for example been required  to
    leave the United Kingdom on active service.

18.  The Appellant also complained that the applications made whilst he  was
    still in the Territorial Army were rejected on incorrect grounds namely
    non-payment of a fee which in fact was not payable.  The Judge noted at
    paragraph 6 that it was not clear whether the Appellant had  sought  to
    challenge the Respondent's decisions to reject. In the case of a second
    application made by the Appellant in 2011 (for leave  to  remain  as  a
    spouse) which was rejected  by  the  Respondent  she  appears  to  have
    reconsidered that  rejection  but  maintained  her  decision.   In  the
    circumstances it  is  difficult  to  see  how  the  argument  that  the
    Respondent  in  the  past  had  not  dealt   correctly   with   earlier
    applications made by the Appellant carried any weight  in  the  present
    proceedings.  The present appeal against a further application made  in
    2014 could hardly be the appropriate forum for  an  historical  inquiry
    into previous leave applications made by the Appellant.

19.  Much was made of the  argument  that  the  temporary  separation  of  a
    couple whilst one went back  to  apply  for  entry  clearance  was  not
    addressed in Appendix FM.  However it is  difficult  to  see  how  that
    point impacts with any significance on the issues raised in this  case.
    It is important to consider the remainder of the headnote in  the  case
    of Chen which states:

         "There may be cases in which there are no insurmountable obstacles
         to family life being enjoyed outside the  UK  but  where  temporary
         separation to enable an individual to make an application for entry
         clearance may be disproportionate.  In all cases it will be for the
         individual to place before the Secretary  of  State  evidence  that
         such temporary separation will  interfere  disproportionately  with
         protected rights.  It will not be enough to rely  solely  upon  the
         case law concerning Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40."

20.  In other  words  whilst  Appendix  FM  did  not  include  consideration
    whether it would be disproportionate to expect temporary separation the
    burden was still  upon  the  Appellant  to  show  that  such  temporary
    separation  would  be  disproportionate.   At  paragraph  23   of   the
    determination the Judge summarised the ratio in  Chen  and  then  dealt
    with the point at paragraph 24 which I have quoted above.  It  was  for
    the Judge to decide whether the temporary  separation  which  would  be
    caused by the Appellant  returning  to  Dominica  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance from there was or was not proportionate to the legitimate aim
    being pursued.  It is quite  clear  at  paragraph  24  that  the  Judge
    considered that very point and made his decision accordingly.  It would
    not be correct to say that  the  Judge  did  not  consider  the  appeal
    outside the Immigration Rules.  He clearly did, see also paragraph 25.

21.  The confusion appears to have arisen as a  result  of  what  the  Judge
    went on to say at paragraph 26 when he said that this was  not  a  case
    where the Appellant was in a situation not contemplated by  the  Rules.
    That remark has to be seen in the context of what the Judge went on  to
    say that the Appellant was in a situation foreseen by  the  Rules  "but
    where he cannot meet the  requirements  including  those  of  paragraph
    EX.1".  That was the situation contemplated by the  Rules.   I  do  not
    read paragraph 26 as being a reference  back  to  the  Chen  point  but
    rather the Judge was making a different point that the Appellant  could
    not meet the Immigration Rules and there was nothing in the  case  that
    justified granting leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules.

22.  The Judge appears to have erred in considering that  the  lower  figure
    of �16,900 might be sufficient to meet the terms of Appendix FM.   That
    as First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers pointed out was an error  in  the
    Appellant's favour.  The Appellant's argument whilst acknowledging that
    the Judge was wrong was that a near miss meant this could be looked  at
    exceptionally under the terms of SS (Congo).

23.  I do not consider that that gives rise to any argument that  the  Judge
    erred in law.  The essence of a near-miss argument is an acceptance  by
    the court that the Appellant has failed to meet the  Immigration  Rules
    where relevant but nevertheless the  appeal  should  still  be  allowed
    outside the Rules.  What happened here was almost exactly the  reverse.
    The Judge erroneously  found  that  the  Appellant  met  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules and had to bear that in mind when deciding on
    the overall proportionality  exercise  (given  that  there  were  still
    matters that the Appellant could not satisfy within the Rules).

24.  The Judge  carefully  considered  that  point  and  found  against  the
    Appellant.  He  was  aware  of  the  arguments  that  the  partner  had
    employment in the UK and had never been to the Appellant's home country
    but for  the  reasons  which  he  gave  at  paragraph  21  and  22  any
    difficulties  there  might  be  in  relocation  could  not  amount   to
    insurmountable obstacles.  It was at that point  that  the  Judge  then
    turned his attention to  the  issue  of  temporary  separation  if  the
    partner remained in this  country  whilst  the  Appellant  returned  to
    Dominica to apply from there.  This was not a Chikwamba  case  for  the
    reasons advanced by the Presenting Officer in argument before  me.   It
    could not be said that the Appellant would automatically  succeed  upon
    return therefore it was not a mere  bureaucratic  requirement  that  he
    should return to Dominica and apply for  entry  clearance  from  there.
    There were issues which would need to be dealt with in an  application.
    The Judge was correct in apportioning little weight to the relationship
    between the Appellant and the partner.  The criticism made of the Judge
    that he failed to cite sufficient case law falls down at this point not
    least because the 2002 Act  applies  in  the  proportionality  exercise
    because it is a statute.  The Judge was aware of the relevant  part  of
    the section and applied it.  Given the  little  weight  that  could  be
    ascribed to the relationship developed at a time when the Appellant had
    no leave, it was difficult to see how the Respondent's  decision  would
    be disproportionate under Article 8.  The Judge gave clear  and  cogent
    reasons for his findings and I  uphold  his  decision  to  dismiss  the
    Appellant's appeal.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
