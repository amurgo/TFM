Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr N Aborisade, of OA Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Rasidat Olabisi Oseni,  date  of  birth  21.4.42,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cockrill, who dismissed her appeal against the  decision  of  the
    respondent, dated 4.7.13, to refuse her application made on  9.8.12  to
    vary leave to remain  and  to  remove  her  from  the  UK  pursuant  to
    directions issued under  section  47  of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 7.2.14.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge White granted permission to appeal on 9.4.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 3.6.14 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Cockrill should be set aside.

 7. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    appellant previously had indefinite leave to enter. Her spouse died  in
    1972 and her leave was revoked in 1978, apparently because she had been
    out of the UK for over a year. Since then she has regularly visited her
    children in the UK as a family visitor.

 8. Since 2002, as set out in the chronology prepared  by  the  respondent,
    the appellant has been back and forth between Nigeria, the UK and  also
    to the USA, where her third son resides.  She  was  issued  a  multiple
    entry visa on 17.3.2008, valid to 17.3.13 and her last period of  leave
    on entry was granted  on  13.7.12,  for  a  period  of  180  days.  The
    application for indefinite leave to  remain  on  the  grounds  of  long
    residence was made under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules, which
    requires a period of 10  years  continuous  lawful  residence.  It  was
    refused because she  failed  to  demonstrate  continuous  residence  as
    defined under paragraph 276A(a);  her  residence  in  the  UK  was  not
    unbroken.

 9. The respondent also  considered  the  appellant's  circumstances  under
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules but  concluded  she  did  not
    meet those requirements in relation to continuous residence  or  having
    no ties to her home country.

10. At �38 of the determination, Judge Cockrill found  that  the  appellant
    could not meet 276ADE, given that she was renting a property in Nigeria
    and was back and forth to Nigeria over the  years.  At  �56  the  judge
    noted that the appellant had chosen to  spend  significant  periods  of
    time outside the UK. At �62, the judge found that the  appellant  could
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  and  proceeded  to
    consider the appellant's circumstances under article 8 ECHR private and
    family life. The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

11. The grounds of appeal, as explained by Mr Aborisade appear to be:

      a) that the judge failed to address  276ADE(vi)  in  relation  to  the
         retention of ties to Nigeria; it is asserted that the appellant has
         lost all ties to Nigeria;

      b) That the appellant appealed on the basis that paragraph 317  should
         have been considered, on the basis  of  an  adult  dependant  of  a
         person settled in the UK;

      c) That under article 8 ECHR the appellant's  medical  conditions  are
         that she cannot return to Nigeria and continue going back and forth
         between Nigeria and the UK;

12. In granting permission to appeal, Judge White  was  satisfied  that  in
    reaching his decision the judge arguably made an error of law  for  the
    following reasons:

      a) "At paragraph 50 of the determination  the  judge  finds  that  the
         appellant does not meet Paragraph 276ADE based  on  the  fact  that
         "the continuity of residence has been broken by the appellant being
         away from this country."

      b) "The judge, however,  makes  no  finding  as  to  whether  (if  the
         appellant has continuously lived in the UK for less than 20  years)
         the appellant has no ties with Nigeria (see Paragraph 276ADE(vi))."

13. In the Rule 24 response, the Secretary of State submits that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  directed  himself  appropriately.  "The  appellant
    arrived in the UK in 2012 on a  visit  visa.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge found that the appellant had been travelling back  and  forth  to
    Nigeria over the years maintaining a  property  there.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge also noted the gaps when the appellant was  outside  the
    UK as set out at paragraph 37 of the determination. It  is  clear  that
    the appellant has not been living continuously in the UK for  at  least
    twenty years. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision."

14. At the  outset  of  the  hearing  Mr  Aborisade,  who  represented  the
    appellant at the First-tier Tribunal appeal,  sought  leave  to  adduce
    further evidence under Rule 15 in relation to the  appellant's  medical
    condition. This is evidence that was not before the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge. I explained that I would not grant leave at  this  stage  as  we
    were considering whether there was an error of law in relation  to  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, based on the evidence then  before
    the judge. Further evidence may be relevant  if  I  set  that  decision
    aside and decided to remake it in the Upper Tribunal.

15. Mr Aborisade accepted that the appellant did not  and  could  not  meet
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration  Rules,  as  her  residence  was  not
    unbroken. That was the application for leave to remain on the basis  of
    long residence.  For  the  same  reason,  he  also  accepted  that  the
    appellant could not meet the residence condition of 276ADE. Those parts
    of the determination were not challenged.

16. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was no material error
    of law in the making of the First-tier Tribunal  decision  such  as  to
    require the decision to be set aside and remade.

17. In relation to 276ADE(vi), whilst I  accept  that  the  judge  did  not
    explicitly state that 276ADE(vi) was not met,  the  ties  test,  it  is
    clear from  a  reading  of  the  determination  that  was  the  judge's
    intention and that it was the inevitable  conclusion  on  the  evidence
    that the appellant failed to demonstrate that she  had  lost  all  ties
    with her home country, including family, social and cultural.

18. At �38 of the determination the judge recited  the  submission  of  the
    respondent that because the  appellant  had  been  back  and  forth  to
    Nigeria she could not be said to have severed all  ties  with  Nigeria,
    where she also maintained a property.  Her  witness  statement  claimed
    that she had decided to stay in the UK because she did not have anybody
    in Nigeria and that as her health had deteriorated there was no one  to
    look after her. She claimed that her colleagues and close relatives had
    died. Although not mentioned in the statement, I was also told that she
    had now sold her home in Nigeria and at �58 the judge  noted  that  she
    was now renting property in Nigeria. At �47 the judge  noted  that  the
    appellant wanted access to UK medical facilities as she had a number of
    medical conditions.

19. Reading �56, �59 and �64 of the determination  together,  it  is  clear
    beyond dispute  that  the  appellant  has  retained  ties  to  Nigeria,
    including maintaining a home there, even if rented. The judge  referred
    to the pattern of the appellant's life, coming back and  forth  between
    Nigeria and the UK. At �60 the judge found that the appellant does  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules under  276ADE.  Even  if
    there is an error in  failing  to  state  it  in  plain  terms,  it  is
    inevitable on the judge's findings of fact that the appellant could not
    demonstrate that she had lost all ties, including  family,  social  and
    cultural with Nigeria. To suggest otherwise flies in the  face  of  the
    patently obvious. That the appellant no  longer  wishes  to  reside  in
    Nigeria is also obvious, but that alone or even selling her  home  does
    not entitle the appellant to remain in the UK as a matter of choice and
    certain does not mean that she can unilaterally severe ties to  Nigeria
    on will.

20. Whilst the judge failed to specifically set out a finding  in  relation
    to ties to Nigeria, I find that it is implicit in the determination and
    even if it is not, there would be no point in setting the determination
    aside only to dismiss it again by specifying  that  the  appellant  has
    failed to demonstrate that she no longer had ties to Nigeria, including
    family, social and cultural. Thus whilst there may have been  an  error
    of law in this regard it  was  not  material  to  the  outcome  of  the
    determination, as the appeal would still have  been  dismissed  if  the
    error were to be corrected.

21. The judge  has  also  considered  the  alleged  claim  in  relation  to
    dependant adult relative. There was no such  application,  but  it  was
    raised in the grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  wrongly
    referring to paragraph 317. As this was an application made on  9.8.12,
    the relevant provisions are those within Appendix FM, summarised by the
    judge at �39 to �40 of the determination, including the  submission  of
    the respondent at �41 that the medical  evidence  was  insufficient  to
    demonstrate that the appellant met the requirement and it  had  not  in
    fact even been asserted by the appellant that she did do so. At �60  of
    the determination the judge refers to those submissions in noting  that
    the appellant could not meet the adult dependant relative criteria of E-
    ECDR. This is also taken into account at �61 where the judge  considers
    whether the appellant's circumstances amount to a Chikwamba  situation,
    sending the appellant  back  to  Nigeria  when  her  application  as  a
    dependant relative would undoubtedly succeed. In fact, the  judge  said
    it was not as clearly cut that she would be able to meet the  dependent
    relative criteria. That the  appellant  did  not  meet  these  specific
    criteria was set out clearly at �62 of the determination.

22. The judge  went  on  from  �62  onwards  to  consider  the  appellant's
    circumstances outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of  article  8
    ECHR. Given that this decision was made in  February  2014,  after  the
    promulgation of MF (Nigeria) in the Court of Appeal and Gulshan in  the
    Upper Tribunal (which the judge referenced at �65), it could be  argued
    that the judge should not have gone on to consider  article  8  without
    first finding that there were arguably  good  grounds  for  considering
    that the appellant's circumstances were so compelling  as  to  justify,
    exceptionally, granting leave to remain outside the  Immigration  Rules
    on the basis of article 8 ECHR, such that the decision of the Secretary
    of State was unjustifiably harsh. However, that point was not taken and
    the judge did give the appellant's  circumstances  consideration  under
    the Razgar principles.

23. The principle factor in the proportionality balancing exercise was  the
    judge's conclusion that until now  the  appellant  has  been  perfectly
    happy going back and forth between Nigeria and the UK as a visitor. She
    has spent considerable time in Nigeria and  very  understandably,  this
    point having been made several times in the  determination,  the  judge
    concluded that requiring her to return there  could  not  constitute  a
    disproportionate decision. I do not consider that it required any  more
    elaboration than that.

24. However, Mr Aborisade argued that the  appellant's  medical  conditions
    mean that she cannot now continue dividing her time between Nigeria and
    the UK. Judge Cockrill noted a number  of  reasons  why  the  appellant
    wanted to remain in the UK, one of which was to access  the  UK  health
    services, which she has been exploiting during her time as  a  visitor.
    The appellant's health concerns are very  well  documented  at  several
    locations within the determination, including at �25, 26, 30,  32,  48,
    and 58. Other reasons include access and contact with  family  members,
    who are British citizens.

25. However, there is nothing within the medical evidence that  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal to suggest that the  appellant  was  unable  to
    travel back to Nigeria, despite her ailments. Her symptoms are said  to
    be under control with medication. The only reference in the grounds  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal state that she is a diabetic patient.
    Her  desire  to  take  advantage  of  the  medical  services  here   is
    insufficient grounds to grant leave to remain, as the  judge  noted  at
    �57 of the determination.

26. It is not entirely clear how Mr Aborisade  relies  on  the  appellant's
    medical conditions. They certainly do not cross the high  threshold  of
    article 3 and whilst they are part and parcel of her  present  personal
    circumstances, there is nothing in the evidence before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to suggest that the appellant could not continue  the  pattern
    she has developed over the years of maintaining the  family  life  with
    relatives through occasional  visits  from  Nigeria,  with  the  family
    continuing their responsibility  for  her  maintenance  (see  �30)  and
    funding her medical treatment (see �58). Like Judge Cockrill, I  cannot
    agree with Mr Aborisade's description of the appellant's  circumstances
    as 'exceptional' in the sense that I do not find that the judge  should
    have found on the evidence that they are so compelling as  to  justify,
    exceptionally, granting leave to remain outside the  Immigration  Rules
    or  that  would  render  the  decision  of  the   First-tier   Tribunal
    unjustifiably harsh.

Conclusions:

27. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
