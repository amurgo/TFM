                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 we make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any
    matter  likely  to  lead  members  of  the  public  to   identify   the
    respondents. Breach of this order can be  punished  as  a  contempt  of
    court. We make this order because two  of  the  respondents  are  young
    children.

 2. The respondents to this appeal, who I will call  "the  claimants",  are
    Somalis.  They are part of a family.  The first appellant is the father
    of the other two appellants who are twins born in June 2010 and so  are
    now aged nearly 5 years.  They made an application for entry  clearance
    to join their sponsor who is respectively the wife and  mother  of  the
    claimants and the application was  properly  refused  under  the  Rules
    because the application had been framed as an  application  for  family
    reunion as a refugee family when the claimants are  not  qualified  for
    admission in that capacity because the sponsor in the United Kingdom is
    not a refugee.  Rather she is permitted to remain in the United Kingdom
    as a person who is a family member of a refugee. That does not  entitle
    her relatives to join her under the Family Refugee Reunion provisions.

 3. This history was all accepted before the First-tier Tribunal.  The case
    was argued on grounds relying on Article 8 of the  European  Convention
    on Human Rights and was resolved in favour  of  the  claimants  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.

 4. We have to say that we have considerable sympathy  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge who, whether or not she expressed it, was plainly  moved
    by circumstances which are compelling and are concerning in this  case.
    A material point is that the sponsor, who is, if we might  respectfully
    observe, a very young woman to be the mother of three children, entered
    the United Kingdom when she pregnant and left behind young twins.   She
    entered the United Kingdom to join her mother. The First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge was clearly anxious to preserve or create family unity,  if  that
    were possible.  That intention is wholly  consistent  with  a  decision
    maker's obligations under section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 and is essentially a desirable  thing  to  achieve
    but what is desirable is not always possible because other factors have
    to be considered.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was  criticised  for  not  paying  more
    attention to the scheme of the Rules  but  we  find  that  criticism  a
    little puzzling.  I hope it is not  going  to  be  suggested  that  the
    Tribunal Judges should follow the example of the Secretary of State and
    give copious reasons about why certain Rules do not apply  when  nobody
    thought that they did.  It was clear that this is not a case that could
    be allowed under the Rules except  insofar  as  the  Rules  encapsulate
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and  so  permit  a
    case to be allowed exceptionally. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  dealt
    with  the  appeal  by  reference  to  the  Convention  and  established
    jurisprudence.

 6. Consideration of the Rules raised two considerations.

 7. The first was that the sponsor's status is precarious and the rules  do
    not generally provide for a person to  join  someone  whose  status  is
    precarious. In some circumstances  this  would  be  a  very  compelling
    reason for refusing anyone permission to enter. We are  not  sure  that
    that is a particularly powerful reason  on  the  facts  of  this  case.
    Typically a person with unsettled status in the United Kingdom will  be
    a student with leave to enter for a temporary  purpose  and  is  in  no
    position to think about promoting family life.

 8. The facts are different here.  We have indicated that this  application
    concerns a divided family.  There was evidence to suggest that  it  was
    not possible for the family to reunite in Kenya or in  Somalia.   There
    was evidence that the first appellant had gone to Somalia to  work  and
    friends had been shot there.  It does not necessarily follow from  that
    that there is no possibility the family ever established themselves  in
    Somalia but  it  is  certainly  a  reason  to  be  extremely  cautious.
    Similarly there is evidence that conditions for refugees in  Kenya  are
    very difficult and there was some evidence that  there  was  no  proper
    documentation for the appellants to be in Kenya and so, by implication,
    there is no legal basis for her joining them there.

 9. The second is that the public interest is against their being  admitted
    in the present circumstances.

10.  We  find  the  requirements  of  Section  117B  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to be  particularly  telling.   Section
    117A obliges a decision maker to have regard to 117B and  section  117B
    provides that is in the public interest that those who seek to enter or
    remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak  English  and  are
    financially independent.

11. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has not considered this  properly  or  at
    all. Certainly there is reference in the Decision to  the  earnings  of
    the sponsor in the United Kingdom. They show considerable diligence  on
    the sponsor's part. As far as we know she is a young person without any
    particularly useful qualifications. She has responsibility for a  small
    child and for her own mother whose own  health  is  such  that  she  is
    entitled to a carer's allowance. Nevertheless,  she  still  manages  to
    earn  something  in  the  order  of  �600  to  �700  per  month  and  a
    considerable portion of her income is forwarded to her family in Kenya.
     She appears to us to be an enterprising  and  diligent  woman  and  we
    respect that.

12. The fact remains that she does not earn nearly enough  to  support  her
    family.  We have regard to the sort of sums that would be necessary  if
    the application were brought under Appendix FM.  We are  not  told  the
    precise sums but we think that the claimant's wife would need an income
    of �18,300 for her husband and �2,600 for each  of  the  children.  She
    does not earn anywhere near to that sum.

13. We find the First-tier Tribunal, although having clear regard  to  some
    of the provisions of Section 117B, really lost sight  of  the  specific
    requirement to have regard to the need for people entering  the  United
    Kingdom not to be a burden on the taxpayer.

14. We find it clear that if the claimants  were  admitted  their  presence
    would create a financial burden on the taxpayer  because  they  do  not
    have access to sufficient money meet their needs.

15. It was argued before us  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  failure  to
    consider this could not have  made  any  difference.   It  could.   The
    contention that it is not a determinative consideration is right and we
    recognise that.  It is no more than a factor to consider but it  is  an
    important factor and it has to be considered.  We do not accept  for  a
    moment that the fact that the financial provisions were not  considered
    is immaterial.

16. It will be recognised that there are circumstances here that do  instil
    compassion and concern but that is  not  enough  to  say  the  case  is
    established on Article 8 grounds.  We find that the First-tier Tribunal
    erred by not considering expressly the provisions  of  117B(3)  of  the
    2002 Act.  It is an error that we must correct.

17. We recognise that family reunion is a desirable  goal,  that  union  in
    Kenya may not be possible at all and that union in Somalia is  probably
    unrealistic  unless  and  until  conditions  there  improve.  The  best
    interests of the minor claimants almost certainly lie in their  joining
    their mother in the United Kingdom and their father entering with them.

18. However we also find that, although there are compassionate  issues  in
    this appeal, the public interest in them being financially  independent
    so outweighs the desirability of the family  living  together  that  we
    must conclude that they have failed to show that they have a  right  to
    enter the United Kingdom.

19. We do note that the First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  appeal  on  the
    premise that the sponsor would have been recognised as a  refugee.   We
    find that this does not add anything useful to the  appellants'  cases.
    The fact is that the sponsor is not a refugee.  She did  not  introduce
    herself as a refugee when she arrived.  We do not know what would  have
    happened if she had said that she was a refugee.  The fact is  she  did
    not and we must deal with the facts as they are, not as they might have
    been if events had taken a different course.

20. It follows  therefore  that  although  we  understand  the  sympathetic
    reasons for the First-tier Tribunal making the decision that it did  it
    erred in law.

21. We correct that error and  when  we  correct  that  error  we  have  to
    substitute a decision saying that the  claimants'  appeal  against  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision is dismissed.

    Decision

    Entry Clearance Officer's appeal allowed. We set aside the decision  of
    the First-tier  Tribunal  and  substitute  a  decision  dismissing  the
    claimant's appeals.
