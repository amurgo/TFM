                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Ross promulgated on 30th September 2014.

 2. The Appellants born 8th August 1981, 7th July 1981, and  13th  February
    2010 are citizens of Pakistan.  The First  and  Second  Appellants  are
    husband and wife and are the parents of the Third Appellant.

 3. On 22nd March 2013 the First Appellant applied for leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant under the Points-Based
    System (PBS).  The Second and Third Appellants  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as his dependants.

 4. On 3rd February 2014 the applications were refused, and decisions  made
    to remove the Appellants from the United Kingdom.

 5. The  First  Appellant's  application  was  refused  with  reference  to
    paragraph 322(1A) and (2) of the Immigration  Rules  which  I  set  out
    below;

    (1A) where false representations have been made or false  documents  or
         information have been submitted (whether or  not  material  to  the
         application, and whether or not to the applicant's  knowledge),  or
         material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed,  in  relation  to  the
         application or in order to obtain documents from the  Secretary  of
         State or a third party required in support of the application;

    (2)  the making of false representations or the failure to disclose any
         material fact for the purpose of obtaining  leave  to  enter  or  a
         previous variation of leave or in order to  obtain  documents  from
         the Secretary of State or a third party required in support of  the
         application for leave to enter or a previous variation of leave;

 6. In giving reasons for refusal the Respondent noted that in  a  previous
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant submitted
    on 15th July 2010, the First Appellant had claimed �13,211  net  profit
    from his self-employment as a Business and  Management  Consultant  for
    the period 10th July 2009 to 9th July 2010.

 7. The Respondent had conducted enquiries  with  HM  Revenue  and  Customs
    (HMRC) and discovered that in the tax year between 1st April  2009  and
    31st March 2010, the First Appellant  had  declared  a  net  profit  of
    �5,624, and between 1st April 2010 and 31st March 2011 a net profit  of
    �453.  No self-employment was submitted for the  tax  years  ending  in
    April 2012 and April 2013.

 8. The Respondent noted that the earnings declared by the First  Appellant
    to the Secretary of State differed from  those  declared  to  HMRC  and
    concluded that the First Appellant had made  false  representations  in
    his application for leave to remain in July 2010.

 9. In the current application the First Appellant had claimed a net profit
    of �14,831 from self-employment during the period 16th  March  2012  to
    15th March 2013.  Having regard to the fact that the First  Appellant's
    declarations to HMRC did not corroborate his claimed  earnings  in  his
    application for leave to  remain  in  July  2010,  the  Respondent  was
    satisfied that the First Appellant had made  false  representations  in
    his current application.

10. Therefore his application  was  refused  with  reference  to  paragraph
    322(1A) in relation to his current application, and paragraph 322(2) in
    relation  to  the  representations  he  had  made  in  his  July   2010
    application.  Therefore no points were awarded  under  Appendix  A  for
    previous earnings.

11. The applications of  the  Second  and  Third  Appellants  were  refused
    without the Respondent making a reference to any  particular  paragraph
    of the Immigration Rules, the inference  being  that  the  applications
    were  refused  because  the  First  Appellant's  application  had  been
    refused.

12. The appeals  submitted  by  the  Appellants  were  heard  together  and
    dismissed by Judge Ross (the judge) on 11th September 2014.   In  brief
    summary the judge found that the First Appellant  accepted  that  false
    representations had been made in the July 2010 Tier 1 application,  and
    found that the Respondent had satisfied  the  burden  of  proving  that
    false representations were made, as this was not in dispute.

13. The Appellants had also relied upon Article  8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention in their Grounds of Appeal.  The judge found that to  remove
    the Appellants from the United Kingdom as a  family  would  not  breach
    Article 8.

14. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.
    In summary it was contended that the judge had erred  in  finding  that
    the First Appellant had accepted making false  representations  in  the
    2010 application and had erred in finding that the burden of proof  had
    been discharged by the Respondent.

15. It was contended that at no point had the First Appellant accepted that
    he had made false representations, and his case before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was that the figures declared  to  HMRC  differed  from  those
    declared to the Respondent, because of  an  error  made  by  the  First
    Appellant's accountant in submitting his tax return.

16. It was also contended that the judge had erred in  making  findings  on
    matters that were not put to the First Appellant at the hearing and  of
    which he had  no  prior  notice,  and  paragraph  11  of  the  decision
    contained inadequate reasoning.

17. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins in the
    following terms;

         "1.  Whilst the Appellants might find it very hard  to  resist  the
             Respondent's criticisms it is,  I  find,  reasonably  arguable
             that the First-tier Tribunal misunderstood  fundamentally  the
             First Appellant's case concerning which documents  were  wrong
             because of the alleged failings of his accountant.

         2.   Further it is, I find, reasonably arguable that the First-tier
             Tribunal did not deal satisfactorily  with  paragraph  322(1A)
             requiring that an application be refused whereas refusal under
             paragraph 322(2) providing that an application should normally
             be refused.

         3.   Each of the grounds may be argued but the Appellants  must  be
             astute to show how any error that is established is material."



18. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending, in summary, that the errors identified in the  grounds
    of application were not material and that it was open to the  judge  to
    find that there were false representations  made  in  the  applications
    submitted to the Respondent in July 2010 and in March 2013.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of Law

19. Having heard submissions from Mr Pretzell who relied upon his  skeleton
    argument dated 13th  March  2015  in  submitting  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law, and from Mr Avery who relied upon  the  rule
    24 response,  in  contending  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not
    materially erred, I decided that the judge had erred  in  law  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside.

20. I found that the judge erred in paragraph 9 in finding that  the  First
    Appellant accepted that false representations were  made  in  the  July
    2010 Tier 1 application.  The First Appellant  had  not  disputed  that
    different figures regarding his self-employment had  been  provided  to
    HMRC, and to the Secretary of State.  This did not mean that the  First
    Appellant  accepted  that  a  false  representation,   which   entailed
    dishonesty, had been made to the Secretary of State.   The  explanation
    for the discrepancy in the  figures  was  that  the  First  Appellant's
    accountant had not included all of his income in his tax return.  I did
    not find any evidence  to  substantiate  the  finding  that  the  First
    Appellant accepted that a false representation had  been  made  to  the
    Secretary of State in relation to the July 2010 application.

21. I found that the judge erred in paragraph 12 of the decision, which  is
    set out below;

         "12.  The  burden  is  on  the  Respondent  to  prove  that   false
             representations were made, which I  find  is  satisfied  given
             that it is not in dispute.  The Appellant has not provided any
             evidence from his accountants that there was a mistake or that
             he was unaware of the accountant's mistake.  In any event, the
             Tier 1 form in 2010 was completed by the Appellant and I  find
             that he must have known that  the  claimed  earnings  differed
             considerably from his tax return figures."

22. In my view the judge repeats the error made in paragraph 9  by  stating
    that it was not in dispute that false representations were  made.   The
    evidence indicates that this was very much in dispute.  It is not clear
    whether the judge is making a finding in relation  to  the  March  2013
    application in this paragraph.  It is the March 2013  application  that
    is the subject of the refusal pursuant to paragraph 322(1A).  The judge
    finds that false representations were made, but it is  not  clear  that
    this finding relates to the March 2013 application as well as the  July
    2010 application.  If  the  finding  does  relate  to  the  March  2013
    application, then the finding is inadequately reasoned  as  it  is  not
    clear why the judge has reached that conclusion.

23. Having  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  both
    representatives indicated that they were in a position  to  proceed  so
    that the decision could be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.

Re-Making the Decision

Evidence

24. The First Appellant adopted his witness statement dated  5th  September
    2014.  He was questioned by both representatives and  I  have  recorded
    all questions and answers in my Record of Proceedings  and  it  is  not
    necessary to reiterate them here.  In brief summary the First Appellant
    confirmed that the income from his self-employment which  was  provided
    to the Secretary of State in the applications made  in  July  2010  and
    March 2013 was correct.  He explained that  he  had  provided  evidence
    with his applications to support the figures.  In relation to the  July
    2010 application he only became aware of the  discrepancy  between  the
    income provided to HMRC, and the income provided to the Respondent when
    he  received  the  Respondent's  decision   to   refuse   his   current
    application, which is dated 3rd February 2014.

25. The First Appellant then went to speak with  the  accountant  that  had
    prepared his earlier tax return and discovered that his accountant  had
    failed to take into account invoices for the period between April  2010
    and July 2010, and therefore there had been an under declaration of his
    income to HMRC.  He then changed accountants and stated  that  his  new
    accountants had remedied the under declaration made to HMRC.

The Respondent's Submissions

26. Mr Avery confirmed that the only issue to be  decided  related  to  the
    contention that the First Appellant had used false  representations  in
    the two applications that he had made to the Respondent  for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom.  The appeals  of  the  Second  and  Third
    Appellants depended upon the result of the First Appellant's appeal.

27. Mr Avery relied upon the reasons given  in  the  Respondent's  decision
    dated 3rd February 2014.  I was asked to note the  discrepancy  between
    the figures submitted on behalf of the First  Appellant  to  HMRC,  and
    those submitted to the Respondent.

28.  Mr  Avery  pointed  out  that  the  First  Appellant  had  blamed  his
    accountant, but there was no satisfactory evidence that he had made any
    formal complaint against the accountant.

29. Mr Avery made no submissions on Article 8, as it had been  agreed  that
    there had been no challenge to the Article 8 findings made by the First-
    tier Tribunal, and therefore those findings must stand.





The Appellants' Submissions

30. Mr Pretzell relied upon  the  skeleton  argument.   He  submitted  that
    paragraph 6A of Appendix C set out  what  documentation  needed  to  be
    provided with an application for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (General)
    Migrant in relation to self-employment.  There was no requirement  that
    any documentation from HMRC should be submitted.

31. It was accepted that different information in relation to self-employed
    earnings had been given to HMRC and the Respondent.   Put  simply  that
    did not amount to the First Appellant making a false representation  to
    the  Respondent.   The   Respondent   had   not   proved   that   false
    representations had been  made,  and  therefore  the  appeals  must  be
    allowed.

32. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

33. The only issues before me related to paragraph 322(1A)  which  if  made
    out is a mandatory refusal,  and  322  (2)  which  is  a  discretionary
    refusal.  The burden of proof  is  on  the  Respondent.   I  take  into
    account that the Court of Appeal in AA (Nigeria) [2010]  EWCA  Civ  773
    when considering paragraph 322(1A) stated in paragraph 76;

         "Dishonesty or deception is needed, albeit not necessarily that  of
         the applicant himself, to render a 'false representation' a  ground
         for mandatory refusal."

34. It is accepted that different figures in  relation  to  previous  self-
    employed earnings were submitted to  HMRC,  when  compared  with  those
    submitted to the Respondent.  I have considered the HMRC figures  which
    are set out in a witness statement prepared by  W  Gilbert  dated  30th
    August 2013.

35. The First Appellant has explained that his accountant was at  fault  in
    submitting his tax return.  No further evidence has been  submitted  by
    the Respondent.  I accept the First Appellant's evidence on this issue.



36. The Respondent's case rests on the fact  that  different  figures  have
    been provided to HMRC  than  were  provided  to  the  Respondent.   The
    Respondent has not  submitted  sufficient  evidence  to  discharge  the
    burden of proof, and has not proved that the figures submitted  to  the
    Respondent are false or that  any  dishonesty  or  deception  has  been
    carried out.

37. I agree with Mr  Pretzell's  succinct  submission,  that  although  the
    figures differ, insufficient evidence has been submitted to  prove  the
    figures submitted to the Respondent in the applications  made  in  July
    2010 and March 2013 amount  to  false  representations.   The  evidence
    submitted by the Respondent does not prove that the First Appellant has
    submitted any documents with his applications for leave to remain, that
    are false.  The fact that different figures were submitted to HMRC when
    compared with those submitted to the Respondent is  not  without  more,
    proof that false representations have been made to the Respondent.

38. As the burden of proof has not been discharged the appeal of the  First
    Appellant must be allowed.  This means that the appeals of  the  Second
    and Third Appellants are also allowed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeals are allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and I see no reason to make an anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the appeals are allowed I have considered whether to make  a  fee  award.
I do not consider it appropriate.   The  appeals  have  been  allowed  after
hearing evidence which was not  made  available  to  the  original  decision
maker.
