Representation:

For the Appellant:       Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Miss S Bassiri-Dezfouli, Counsel, instructed by Gans
& Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to  the  parties  as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Thus the Secretary of State is once more the Respondent  and
    Mr Okoye is the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Singh (the judge), promulgated on 24 February  2016,  in
    which he allowed the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had
    acquired a permanent right of residence  pursuant  to  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 3. The Appellant had married an EEA national on  10  January  2009.   That
    marriage was finally dissolved on 31 October 2014.  By  an  application
    made on 10 November 2014 the Appellant sought confirmation of  a  right
    of permanent residence in the United Kingdom on the basis that  he  had
    been the family member of the EEA national prior to the divorce and had
    retained a right of residence thereafter.  He had, it was said, accrued
    a period of five continuous years living in accordance  with  the  2006
    Regulations.

 4. The application was refused on the basis that there was  a  specific  a
    gap in the EEA national's work record.




The judge's decision

 5. The judge found the evidence submitted on behalf of the Appellant to be
    credible.  He concluded that the Appellant had been married to the  EEA
    national for at least three years and that for one of those years  they
    had lived together in the United Kingdom.  The judge accepted that  the
    EEA national had been working  continuously  in  during  the  tax  year
    2010/2011.  This year is important because it was the Respondent's case
    that there was an evidential gap relating to  this  particular  period,
    and that this gap effectively broke the five year chain as a result  of
    which the Appellant could not succeed in  his claim to have acquired  a
    permanent right of residence.

 6. However the judge  found  that  documentary  evidence  adduced  by  the
    Appellant and referred to in paragraph 14 of the decision permitted him
    to accept that the gap had been filled, as it were. On this  basis  the
    appeal was allowed.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The grounds of appeal  argue  essentially  that  there  was  either  no
    evidential basis upon which the judge could have concluded that the EEA
    national was working during the 2010/2011 tax year, or,  alternatively,
    that he, the judge, had not provided reasons as to why he found  as  he
    did.

 8. Permission was granted in somewhat strange terms by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Davies on 18 August 2016. Judge Davies  states  in  his  decision
    that it was arguable that the  appeal  should  not  have  been  allowed
    outright but rather that the case ought to have been sent back  to  the
    Respondent for an exercise of discretion.




The hearing before me

 9. With reference to the Rule 24 notice provided by the  Appellant  there,
    was  a  discussion  on  a  preliminary  issue,   namely   whether   the
    Respondent's grounds of appeal were in fact before me given  the  terms
    for the grant of permission.  The Respondent had never in  fact  sought
    to argue that there was  a  discretion  in  this  case.   Judge  Davies
    appears to have misconstrued the grounds before him.  I took  the  view
    that the grounds as pleaded were clear and that Judge Davies was simply
    in error in making the observations that he did.

10. Mr Walker was not seeking to rely on this new  ground  and  in  all  he
    circumstances I would permit the Respondent's original  grounds  to  be
    argued before me.

11. Mr Walker confirmed that the sole issue had been and  remained  whether
    or not the EEA national had been  working  or  had  been  self-employed
    during the tax year  2010/2011.   Evidence  obtained  by  HMRC  by  the
    Respondent had shown that she was in self-employment  both  before  and
    after that period.  Mr Walker  essentially  submitted  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence on which the judge could properly have based  his
    finding that the EEA national had in fact been self-employed during the
    2010/2011 tax year.

12. Miss Bassiri-Dezfouli relied upon the evidence cited in paragraph 14 of
    the judge's decision, namely the  penalty  notice  issued  to  the  EEA
    national by HMRC in 2011.  Although the penalty notice referred to  the
    failure to submit a previous tax return, it showed  that  return  there
    was engagement with HMRC and taking the evidence as a whole  the  judge
    had been entitled to find as he did.




Decision on error of law

13. Having reflected on the arguments put and the papers  on  file  I  have
    concluded with a degree of hesitation that the judge did materially err
    in law.  In finding that the evidential gap had been plugged, the judge
    appears to be relying solely on documentary  evidence  referred  to  in
    paragraph 14 of his decision.  That documentary evidence  is  contained
    in G1 of the Respondent's bundle and is, as has already been mentioned,
    a fixed penalty notice from the HMRC to the  EEA  national  from  2011.
    However, the penalty relates to a failure to submit  a  tax  return  or
    submission or late submission of a tax return for the  tax  year  2009-
    2010.  It does not even of itself show that the EEA national  had  been
    self-employed during the 2010/2011 tax year.  It could potentially have
    constituted circumstantial evidence but the judge has not spelled  this
    out or given any adequate reasons that he was regarding it in this way.

14. I have looked at the Record of Proceedings and  all  the  other  papers
    before me and I have not been able to find any other reference  to  the
    EEA national working during this particular tax year.  There is nothing
    contained in the Appellant's witness statement, nothing in  the  Record
    of Proceedings as to oral evidence, and no other source of  information
    specifically refers to this matter. Therefore, even taking the evidence
    as a whole, I cannot see any evidential  basis  upon  which  the  judge
    could properly have based his finding (at least in the way that he did)
    at paragraph 15 of his decision.  This was clearly a material issue  in
    the appeal and therefore the judge's decision must be set aside.




Disposal

15. It is appropriate in this case for me to remake  the  decision  on  the
    evidence now before me.  Both  representatives  were  entirely  content
    with this course of action.  The  evidence  includes  the  Respondent's
    bundle and an Appellant's bundle submitted  for  the  purposes  of  the
    appeal in the Upper Tribunal.  The Appellant's bundle consists in  part
    of the evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  also  additional
    evidence. There has been no objection from Mr Walker to  this  evidence
    being admitted.

16. The following facts are not in dispute. The Appellant  married  an  EEA
    national on 10 January 2009. The termination of that marriage  occurred
    by way of decree absolute on 31 October 2014.  The judge found that the
    Appellant and his ex-wife had lived together for  the  relevant  period
    and there is no  basis  on  which  to  disturb  that  finding.   Having
    obtained evidence from the HMRC contained in the papers before  me  the
    Respondent accepts that the EEA national was working during the  period
    2009-2010 and from 2011 onwards.  There has been no  challenge  to  the
    judge's finding that the Appellant himself has been  working  and  that
    finding is preserved.

17. In light of the preserved findings and the evidence  now  before  me  I
    find that (a) the EEA national was exercising her treaty rights in 2011
    and as at the date of the termination of the  marriage  on  31  October
    2014; (b) that the Appellant has at all material times and as of  today
    been employed by Ikan Facilities. He was employed as  such  during  the
    marriage at the time of the termination and  thereafter.  None  of  the
    updated  evidence  contained  in  the  Appellant's  bundle   has   been
    challenged by Mr Walker, and rightly so. It is from various sources and
    is all entirely consistent with that employment.

18. Therefore I find that he was the family member of the EEA national from
    10 January 2009 until the termination of the  marriage  on  31  October
    2014.  At that point the Appellant retained his right of residence with
    reference to Regulation 10(5) of the 2006 Regulations.   That  retained
    right of residence continues to date.

19. It follows from this that the Appellant has also acquired  a  permanent
    right of residence in the United Kingdom.  If I take the relevant  five
    year period from the beginning  of  2011  (or  at  the  latest  at  the
    beginning of the 2011 tax year in April of  that  year),  the  combined
    period when the Appellant was still a  family  member  and  the  period
    during which he has retained his right of residence has now passed  the
    relevant five year  mark.   There  has  been  no  suggestion  that  the
    Appellant has left this country for any significant period of time.

20. In  light  of  the  above  and  given  that  the  Appellant's  original
    application was for confirmation as to the permanent right of residence
    the Respondent must now issue him with such  confirmation  pursuant  to
    Regulation 18 of the 2006 Regulations.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make  the  decision  by  allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00. The Appellant has relied on evidence  not  submitted  with
the  original  application.  However,  this  has  been  submitted   to   the
Respondent in good time and has not been challenged. This matter did not  in
reality need to come to a hearing.
