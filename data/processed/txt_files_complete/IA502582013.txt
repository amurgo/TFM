Representation:

Appellant:    Mr Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
Respondent:   Mr Bryce (Advocate), instructed by Mackinlay & Suttie
Solicitors


                                  DECISION

 1.  By  a  decision  dated  02  July  2013,  the  Appellant  refused   the
    Respondent's application for leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    The refusal was  based  on  the  Respondent's  failure  to  provide  an
    approved English language comprehension  certificate.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal allowed the appeal.

 2. Since the promulgation of the first instance  decision,  the  Appellant
    has secured the requisite certificate.  She did so on  28  April  2014.
    We were informed that this was transmitted to the Appellant on  15  May
    2014.  Regrettably, it appears to have received no attention.

 3. On behalf of the Appellant, Mr Matthews conceded that  the  certificate
    satisfies the requirements of paragraph 284 of  the  Immigration  Rules
    and applied to withdraw the appeal.  We  acceded  to  his  application,
    having first drawn attention to  the  wholly  unsatisfactory  terms  in
    which the application  for  permission  to  appeal  was  couched.   The
    fundamental flaw was to identify, clearly or at all, the error  of  law
    said to  infect  the  first  instance  Tribunal's  decision.   In  this
    context, we take the opportunity of highlighting the recent decision of
    the Upper Tribunal in Nixon (permission  to  appeal:  grounds)   [2014]
    UKUT 368 (IAC).

ORDER

 4. The Appellant is granted permission to withdraw the  appeal.  Thus  the
    decision of the FtT is affirmed.
