                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 31 July 1992. He appeals
    against a decision on the papers of Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Bart-Stewart sitting at  Taylor  House.  In  that  decision  the  Judge
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  Respondent
    dated 13 December 2017. The Respondent's  decision  was  to  refuse  to
    grant the Appellant entry clearance as the spouse of Aisha Hamayoun,  a
    British citizen ("the sponsor").

 2. The Respondent refused the application because he did not consider that
    the Appellant could meet the English language requirements of  Appendix
    FM contained at section E-ECP.4.1 and 4.2. The Appellant  had  produced
    an IELTS certificate  as  evidence  that  he  could  meet  the  English
    language requirement, but this was for a test which was not  listed  in
    Appendix O to the immigration rules and could not therefore be used for
    applications made under Appendix FM since April  2015.  The  Respondent
    was not satisfied that the Appellant had  passed  an  English  language
    test with a provider approved by UK visas. The Appellant did  not  hold
    any relevant qualifications and  was  not  a  national  of  a  majority
    English speaking country. There were no  exceptional  circumstances  in
    this case which would render refusal a  breach  of  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights. The decision would not  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the Appellant or his family. There
    was no evidence of any exceptional circumstances in the case.

The Appellant's Case

 3.  The  Appellant  appealed  against  this  decision  arguing  that   the
    certificate he had produced was for a test listed  in  Appendix  O  and
    there was no such requirement in the immigration rules as  relied  upon
    by the Respondent. The Appellant had passed an English language test at
    a minimum of level 1 of the  Common  European  Framework  of  Reference
    (CEFR) for languages with a provider approved by  the  Respondent.  The
    test provider was consortium PK 602 and the certificate was awarded  by
    Cambridge English.  The  language  assessment  was  to  CEFR  level  B2
    including marks of listening (6) and speaking (6).  The  Appellant  had
    also provided confirmation of his test booking which showed that he had
    booked and paid for a test and had been issued with the certificate.

 4. Exhibited to the Appellant's notice of appeal was a confirmation letter
    from IELTS dated 6 January 2018 confirming that the  Appellant  was  to
    take his test at the Best Western hotel  in  Islamabad  on  11  January
    2018. This correspondence thus post-dated the Respondent's decision  to
    refuse entry clearance. The Appellant's grounds of appeal  referred  to
    the Appellant booking a new test  to  sit  on  12  January  2017  which
    appears to have been a misprint. The Appellant also argued  that  there
    were exceptional circumstances in this case. He  and  the  sponsor  had
    been married for almost two years and had made every effort to start  a
    family life. The sponsor needed to undergo treatment to  her  eyes  and
    needed urgent care and support from the appellant.

The Decision at First Instance

 5. The Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision on form IAFT-6
    was dated 9  January  2018.  The  credit  card  details  provided  were
    declined initially by the Tribunal's card service provider and  no  fee
    was received. The Appellant and his solicitors were sent  a  notice  on
    form IA 202 requiring payment of  a  fee  of  �80  for  the  appeal  to
    proceed. It appears that this �80 was subsequently paid  and  a  notice
    that the matter was to be determined on the papers on or after 8 August
    2018 was sent out to the Appellant and his solicitors on 12 June 2018.

 6. On 17 and 31 July 2018 the Appellant's solicitors wrote to the Tribunal
    to request an oral hearing, but it does not appear that the balance  of
    the monies due for an oral hearing (�60) was paid and the Tribunal  did
    not action that request. The Appellant's  appeal  came  on  the  papers
    before Judge Bart-Stewart who promulgated her decision on  4  September
    2018. She noted that despite directions neither the Respondent nor  the
    Appellant had filed supporting evidence for the appeal.  What  she  had
    before her  were  the  grounds  of  appeal  filed  by  the  appellant's
    solicitors with photocopy supporting documents.

 7. At [6] of her determination  she  noted  that  the  grounds  of  appeal
    suggested that the Appellant did not  provide  the  specified  evidence
    required and it was not in fact available at the date of application as
    he had only booked but not yet taken his test. The Respondent was under
    no obligation to request further evidence which did not fall under  the
    evidential flexibility policy. At [7] she stated that  a  copy  of  the
    certificate that was submitted with the  application  was  not  in  the
    documents before her. The guidance which was in fact  attached  to  the
    grounds of appeal, showed that for tests taken on or after 6 April 2015
    no document was required as the scores were  verified  using  an  IELTS
    SELT consortium online system using a  unique  reference  number  which
    needed to be stated on the application form.  The  Appellant  therefore
    failed to meet all of the eligibility requirements for a grant of entry
    clearance under the immigration rules.

 8. At [8] the Judge dealt with the Article 8 claim  stating  that  at  the
    time that the Appellant and sponsor married they would have been  aware
    that there was no guarantee that entry clearance would be  granted.  It
    was trite law that there was no obligation on the state to respect  the
    wishes of a married couple to establish family life in that  territory.
    If the Appellant had since passed  an  English  language  test  in  the
    approved manner it was open for him to make  a  fresh  application  for
    entry clearance. The decision under appeal was not  a  disproportionate
    interference with the right to respect for family or private life.  She
    dismissed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

 9. The Appellant appealed against this decision  arguing  that  there  had
    been procedural unfairness because he had requested  an  oral  hearing,
    but the case had been dealt with on the papers. Further, the review  of
    the Entry Clearance Manager (ECM) was not  conducted  properly  and  he
    pointed to an error in the date of the review which suggested  that  it
    had taken  place  before  the  appeal  had  been  lodged.  The  grounds
    reiterated  what  was  said  before  regarding  the  adequacy  of   the
    certificate and that the Appellant had booked a test.

10. The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hollingworth on 5  December  2018.  In
    granting permission to appeal  he  wrote  that  it  was  arguable  that
    unfairness had arisen given that the decision was  on  the  papers  but
    before it was promulgated the representatives had sought in writing for
    an oral hearing to take place.



The Hearing Before Me

11. In consequence of the grant of permission the matter came before me  to
    determine whether there was a material error of law in the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal. There was  no  attendance  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant either by the sponsor or any legal representative. There  was
    no explanation for such absence. I was satisfied  that  notice  of  the
    hearing had been sent by first class  post  to  the  Appellant  at  the
    address  of  the  sponsor  and  to  his  solicitors   and   that   that
    correspondence had not been returned undelivered by the Post Office. No
    application for an adjournment had been received by  the  Tribunal,  no
    decision had been made granting an adjournment and there was  therefore
    no good reason given for the  absence  of  any  representation  on  the
    appellant's behalf.

12. I proceeded with the hearing  and  heard  brief  submissions  from  the
    Presenting Officer. He argued that it was baffling that  the  Appellant
    had requested an oral hearing, yet no further evidence was forthcoming.
    The Judge at first instance had been quite correct in her statement  of
    the  rules.  Since  April  2015  the  Respondent  no  longer   accepted
    certificates with applications for entry clearance. The reason  was  to
    reduce the risk of fraudulent applications. The procedure now was  that
    a reference number should be given on the application form which  could
    then be checked by the Respondent. That unique reference  number  would
    be given by the certifying body. The  failure  to  give  a  certificate
    number on the  application  form  meant  that  the  Appellant  had  not
    complied with the evidential rules set out in Appendix  FM-SE.  As  the
    application for entry clearance was submitted in 2017  it  came  within
    the post April 2015 regime. Any test taken by the Appellant  subsequent
    to the decision would be irrelevant for the purposes of this appeal.

Findings

13. There are three core issues in this appeal. The first is whether  there
    was procedural unfairness in the Judge determining this matter  on  the
    papers when the Appellant had requested (but  not  paid  for)  an  oral
    hearing. The 2nd issue is  whether  the  Appellant  could  satisfy  the
    English language requirements by providing a  certificate,  a  copy  of
    which was in the file. The 3rd issue is whether the Judge  had  made  a
    material error of law in her determination of the Article 8 claim.

14. The copy certificate in the file was dated 16 June 2017 and was in  the
    form of a test report showing an overall band score of 5.5 and a CEF at
    level B2. In the bottom right-hand corner was a test report form number
    which was difficult to decipher from the photocopy. This copy had  been
    supplied by fax by the  solicitors  with  their  letter  17  July  2018
    requesting an oral hearing. I assume that this is the certificate  that
    was referred to by the Respondent. The certificate was rejected because
    it was no longer acceptable evidence. It is not clear whether the  test
    report form number on the bottom right-hand corner of  the  certificate
    is the number that needed to go  in  the  application  form  for  entry
    clearance. For whatever  reason  that  number  was  not  put  into  the
    application by the Appellant.

15. Question 85 on the application form for entry clearance asked: "how did
    you meet the English language requirement?" The  Appellant  replied  by
    stating "IELTS 16 June 2017". This was insufficient for the Respondents
    purposes as it did not comply with the requirements of Appendix  O.  It
    was therefore open to the Respondent to refuse the application on  that
    basis. Appendix O did apply to the Appellant and even if the  Appellant
    was correct that the tester was an  approved  one  and  did  issue  the
    Appellant with an English language test certificate, he still needed to
    provide the appropriate reference number on his application form. There
    was no obligation in those circumstances on the  Respondent  to  assume
    that the number on the certificate supplied could be  utilised  as  the
    appropriate reference number. The post in Islamabad is a very busy  one
    and receives a very  large  number  of  applications.  It  is  not  the
    obligation of the post to redraft application forms so that they comply
    with the Immigration Rules.

16. It is also fair to point out that no further evidence was  supplied  to
    indicate what the Article 8 claim might consist of that would mean that
    it amounted to compelling reasons why it should be allowed outside  the
    Immigration Rules. Not only was nothing provided to Judge  Bart-Stewart
    but nothing further was provided  to  me  in  relation  to  the  onward
    appeal. There was no error of law in Judge Bart-Stewart's treatment  of
    the Article 8 claim. She correctly pointed out there was no  right  for
    the Appellant and sponsor to choose where to enjoy their married  life,
    they would have to satisfy the requirements.

17. Permission to appeal was granted because of a concern that  the  matter
    had been dealt with on the papers despite the Appellant's  request  for
    an oral hearing. Where there is procedural unfairness an Appellant  may
    be entitled to have the decision  against  him  set  aside.  There  are
    however certain difficulties with the Appellant's argument in this case
    that he has been the victim of procedural unfairness. Firstly, no extra
    evidence was supplied by the Appellant to the Tribunal apart  from  the
    copy certificate and the submissions which I have summarised above.  In
    particular there was no further  evidence  to  support  the  Article  8
    claim. Secondly, there was no attendance before me on  the  Appellant's
    behalf to clarify or explain any of the points raised in the course  of
    these proceedings.

18. The Appellant had not completed his application form correctly, he  had
    not complied with the requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  or  Appendix  O.
    Contrary to what was said in the grounds of appeal, Appendix O was very
    much in force and did apply  in  this  case.  The  evidence  of  taking
    another test after the date of decision was irrelevant  to  the  issues
    which the Judge had to decide.  There  was  no  error  of  law  in  her
    rejection of that evidence.

19. No explanation was given to me for the absence from the hearing of  the
    Appellant's representatives or the sponsor. Whilst it was an error  for
    the Judge not to consider the application for the appeal  to  be  heard
    orally rather than to determine it on the papers, it was not in my view
    a material error of law. It was not inevitable  that  the  Judge  would
    have granted the application to deal  with  the  matter  orally  as  no
    explanation was offered why the Appellant had  changed  his  mind  from
    wanting a paper appeal to an  oral  appeal.  No  further  evidence  was
    forthcoming from the Appellant either dealing with the English language
    requirement or more generally with Article 8. It is  difficult  to  see
    what prejudice the Appellant suffered from having the matter dealt with
    by the Judge on the papers as it is not at all clear  what  would  have
    been said on the Appellant's behalf if his request for an oral  hearing
    had been granted. This was an appeal without merit.

20. The Appellant did not satisfy the Immigration Rules because he had  not
    completed his application form  correctly.  He  has  not  supplied  any
    evidence to show why the Article 8 claim was so compelling it should be
    allowed outside the Rules. There was  for  example  no  statement  from
    either the Appellant or the sponsor about the marriage. The  Judge  was
    entitled to dismiss the appeal before her  and  I  dismiss  the  onward
    appeal before me. I agree with the comments of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge that the Appellant's remedy is to make a  fresh  application  for
    entry clearance with the proper documentation this time.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal

Appellant's appeal dismissed

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
