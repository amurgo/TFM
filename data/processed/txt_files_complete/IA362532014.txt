                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                             GIBSON SEMA DINGANA
                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The FtT allowed the appeal of Mr Dingana against a decision of  the
         respondent to refuse to issue him  with  a  residence  card  as  an
         extended family member under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2006.

      2. The SSHD was granted permission on the grounds that the  FtT  judge
         erred Iaw in allowing the appeal  and  it  was  arguable  that  the
         application should have been allowed to  the  extent  that  it  was
         remitted to the SSHD  to  enable  her  to  exercise  discretion  is
         appropriate.

      3. The hearing of the appeal was listed for 21st  July  2015.  In  the
         light of correspondence received from both parties  that  they  are
         aware that the outcome of the appeal will be that an error  of  law
         is found and the  matter  will  be  remitted  to  the  SSHD  as  in
         paragraph 2 above, they are content for this appeal to be  disposed
         of on the papers. I delist  the  hearing  and  make  the  following
         decision:

      4. I am satisfied the FtT erred in law in  allowing  the  appeal.  The
         decision of the FtT is set aside  and  I  remake  the  decision  by
         allowing it only to the extent that it is remitted to the SSHD  for
         her to consider the exercise of discretion.
