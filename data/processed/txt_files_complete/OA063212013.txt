                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs Jainaba Cham, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Ms Vidyadharan, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Britton promulgated on 10 February 2014 whereby the
    judge allowed an appeal under Article  8  against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State dated 12 February 2013.
 2. The Claimant, Mr Yaya Camara, is a citizen of Gambia  and  applied  for
    settlement in the United Kingdom to join  his  wife  and  sponsor,  Mrs
    Jainaba Cham and his daughter, who is a  British  citizen  having  been
    born here in January 2013.

 3. The appeal which is argued before us by Ms Vidyadharan on behalf of the
    Secretary of State is based on two main grounds. The first is that  the
    judge entirely failed to refer to, or take account of, the decision  of
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) which enunciated the test that  Article
    8 assessments should only be carried out outside the Rules  when  there
    are compelling or  compassionate  circumstances  to  justify  admission
    outside the Rules. Second, it is argued that the judge  fell  into  the
    error of approaching the matter on a "near-miss" basis.

The financial requirements

 4. The relevant Rules as to the financial requirements are set out  at  E-
    ECP.3.1. and provided as follows:

         "E-ECP.3.1.   The applicant must provide specified evidence ...  of
                    -


                    (a)    a specified gross annual income of at least -
                        (i)    �18,600;
                        (ii)   an additional �3,800 for  the  first  child;
                             and
                        (iii)  an additional  �2,400  for  each  additional
                             child; alone or in combination with


                    (b)    specified savings of-
                        (i)    �16,000; and
                        (ii)   additional savings of an  amount  equivalent
                             to 2.5 times the amount which is the difference
                             between  the  gross  annual  income  from   the
                             sources listed  in  paragraph  EECP.3.2.(a)-(d)
                             and the total amount required under paragraph E-
                             ECP.3.1.(a); or


                     c) the requirements in paragraph E-ECP.3.3.being met."




 5. The sponsor's evidence of total income was that she had as a result  of
    her employment in Morrisons and BUPA a total income of �18,014.76.  She
    therefore fell short by the figure of �586.

 6. In these circumstances, under the Rules the  respondent  argued  before
    the First-tier Tribunal  that,  given  the  shortfall  in  income,  the
    appellant  had  to  demonstrate  that  his  sponsor  had   savings   of
    �17,463.10. By our calculations, however, that figure is  not  entirely
    accurate because 2.5 x �586 amounts to �1,457 which when added  to  the
    specified savings sum of �16,000 required  by  subparagraph  (b)  above
    gives a figure of �17,457.  We return to this issue below.


Article 8

 7.  We begin by considering Ms Vidyadharan's case that the judge  in  this
    case fell into error because he failed to  apply  the  requisite  legal
    test before going on to make his Article 8 assessment.

 8. Mrs Cham, who appears in person today, says that she has done her  best
    to maximise her earnings, that she works extremely hard, that her total
    income is very nearly sufficient for the Rules and  that  she  and  her
    daughter would be denied their family  life  if  her  husband  was  not
    allowed to enter the United Kingdom.  She  also  says  that  her  young
    daughter would be at risk of female genital mutilation if she  returned
    to the Gambia. She has also raised the question of her daughter  having
    eczema which, she says, would also  make  it  impossible  to  take  her
    daughter back to the Gambia.

 9. We have listened carefully to everything that has been said by Mrs Cham
    and are naturally sympathetic to her plight.   However,  this  Tribunal
    can only act within the powers that it has been given by Parliament and
    we are required to apply the Rules and the law as it appears us to be.

10. We make  the  following  points  and  observations.  Firstly,  we  were
    initially puzzled by the  Rules  which  we  have  quoted  above.   This
    particular  phraseology  of  the  Rules  refers  to  "alone"   or   "in
    combination with". However, in the light of MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin)
    it is clear where the specified income falls  short  of  the  requisite
    figure of �18,600, the  additional  savings  requirement  specified  in
    subparagraph (b) of �16,000,  plus  a  multiple  of  the  shortfall  in
    income, is required. In those circumstances, the analysis in  paragraph
    3 of the judgment, that the  appellant  has  to  demonstrate  that  the
    sponsor has savings of �17,463.10, is correct  in  law,  save  for  the
    minor error in the mathematics to which we have referred.

11. Second, it is quite clear from Gulshan (above) that where an Article  8
    assessment is to be carried  out  outside  the  Rules,  there  must  be
    demonstrated  the  existence   of   exceptional   circumstances   (i.e.
    compelling or  compassionate  circumstances).  It  is  clear  from  the
    judgment  that,  unfortunately,  the  judge  failed  to  address   this
    fundamental legal threshold test at all.

12. It is fair to say that the judge in  paragraphs  5,  6  and  9  of  his
    judgment did mention and analyse the question of the  risk  of  FGM  in
    Gambia if Mrs Cham's daughter was to be taken back there.  He  did  not
    come to any concluded view on the risks attendant if she was to  return
    to Gambia for a visit or otherwise.  He observed, however, at paragraph
    6, and we quote, "her husband would not  push  her  for  Fatima  to  be
    circumcised" even though he was a member of the Mandika tribe where FGM
    is apparently a tradition. He also pointed out in paragraph 9 that  the
    sponsor and her daughter understandably do not want to  return  to  the
    Gambia, not only because they are British citizens but also because  of
    the danger of FGM.


13. Third,  Ms  Vidyadharan  submits,  correctly  in  our  view,  that  the
    references in the judgment to FGM are simply a rehearsal by  the  judge
    of the general evidence that was before him and paragraphs 5, 6  and  9
    do not amount to an application of the Gulshan test. Having read  those
    paragraphs carefully we are compelled to agree.  The failure  to  apply
    the Gulshan test amounts, in our view, to a fundamental error of law.

'Near miss'

14. The matter does not stop there, however, because it is clear  that  the
    ratio  of  the  decision  which  appears  in  paragraph   10   of   the
    Determination and Reasons is also based on an error of law. Having said
    that the appellant did not  meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules,  the  judge  observed  that  the  shortfall  in  the
    sponsor's income was only "just short" of the required amount, and  the
    judge then went on to find that it would be "disproportionate"  not  to
    allow the appellant to settle in this country.

15. Ms Vidyadharan submits that that  finding  by  the  judge  was  to  all
    intents and purposes "a near-miss" finding by him and a flawed decision
    for that reason. We agree. It seems to us quite clear from paragraph 10
    of the Determination and Reasons that the  rationale  for  the  judge's
    decision was that, because the sponsor's income fell only just short of
    the required amount (i.e. outside the Rules),  the  judge  nevertheless
    felt that it would be unfair or disproportionate the appellant was  not
    allowed to settle in this country.  That approach (compassionate as  it
    may be) is not an approach which that Tribunal  is  permitted  to  make
    under the law (see Gulshan).

Conclusion

16. For all those reasons, we are driven to the inevitable conclusion  that
    the Determination and Reasons in this case cannot  stand  because  they
    contain two significant errors of law which are material.  We  are,  in
    these circumstances, bound to quash the decision.


Re-Make Decision

17. Having  carefully  considered  the  matter,  we  consider  that  it  is
    appropriate to go on to remake  the  decision.  In  the  light  of  the
    evidence, we conclude that the  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State should be refused because the appellant did not meet
    the  financial  requirements  under  the  Immigration  Rules   and   no
    sufficiently exceptional or compelling or  compassionate  circumstances
    are demonstrated such as to allow an Article 8 exception  to  be  made.
    We are fortified in this approach by  the  decision  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in R on the application of MM (Lebanon) and others  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department  [2014] EWCA Civ 985, published on  11
    July 2014, in which that court held, inter alia,  that  the  new  Rules
    (post July 2012 but pre July 2014) were not in  principle  incompatible
    with Articles 8, 12 and 14 of the ECHR.

The Immigration Act 2014

18. Since this determination is to be sent to the  parties  after  28  July
    2014, we have had regard to the rule 117B(3) of  the  new  Part  5A  of
    those Rules inserted by s.19 of the Immigration  Act  2014,  which  was
    brought into force on 28 July 2014 by section 3 of the Immigration  Act
    2014 (Commencement No 1, Transitory and Saving Provisions) Order  2014,
    S.I. 2014 no 1820.  The relevant provisions for our  purposes  are  set
    out at paragraph 117A and 117B as follows:

         "117A    Application of this Part
         (1)    This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
              (a)    breaches a person's right to respect for  private  and
                  family life under Article 8, and
              (b)    as a result would be unlawful under section 6  of  the
                  Human Rights Act 1998.
         (2)    In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
              (a)     in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
         117B, ...
         (3)    In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the
         question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
         respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
         8(2).

         117B          Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable
         in all cases
         (1)    The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the
         public interest. ...
         (3)    It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-
             (a)    are not a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b)    are better able to integrate into society."

19. It is clear to us that the introduction of the public interest question
    provisions set out above do not assist the appellant in  any  near-miss
    argument advanced on her behalf.

20. We would add that there is no reason why the appellant, Mr Yaya Camara,
    cannot in the usual way make a further  application  if  and  when  his
    sponsor Mrs Cham's financial situation allows.

Signed                                  Date 31st July 2014
