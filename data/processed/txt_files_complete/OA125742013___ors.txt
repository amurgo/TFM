Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Bloomer, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  8th  July  1984.
    The  second  and  third  Appellants  are  her  infant   children   born
    respectively on 29th March 2010 and 29th  June  2011.   All  references
    within this determination unless specified to the contrary are  to  the
    first Appellant.  The appeal of the second  and  third  Appellants  are
    directly linked to that of the first Appellant and rise and fall on the
    outcome of her appeal.

 2. The Appellant had applied for  entry  clearance  for  settlement  as  a
    partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.   Her  application
    was considered under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM and was  refused
    by Notice of Refusal  dated  29th  May  2013  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant had failed to submit the specified evidence for the specified
    period as stated in Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules  and  as  a
    result  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not  satisfied  that   the
    Appellant's Sponsor was employed  with  the  employer  stated  for  the
    period stated and the pay level as stated as claimed in the Appellant's
    application.

 3. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Edwards sitting at Manchester on 28th January 2014.  In a
    determination promulgated on the same day the  Appellant's  appeal  was
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and pursuant to Article 8 of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

 4. On 6th March 2014 the Appellant lodged Grounds of Appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  Those grounds contended that the judge erred in relation  to
    the payslips describing them as "fictitious" notwithstanding supporting
    documentary evidence and the Sponsor's explanation that the actual sums
    paid to him were only received in some of the months shown, at a  later
    date.  It was further contended within the grounds that the  judge  had
    misunderstood parts of the evidence finding against the Appellant  that
    he did not mention in his witness statement that he had been  suffering
    from  stress  and  had  started  to  work  part-time.   In  fact,   the
    Appellant's clear oral evidence was that the reduction in working hours
    due to stress occurred only after  the  adverse  immigration  decisions
    were made and so there was no  material  inconsistency.   It  was  also
    contended that the judge erred in relation to the  Sponsor's  employer,
    wrongly finding that the company was established  some  six  years  ago
    whereas it was incorporated  in  March  2012  and  in  overlooking  the
    explanation given by the Appellant  for  the  withdrawal  of  funds  in
    November 2012.

 5. Further it was contended that the judge had erred in relation to  human
    rights and that contrary to  paragraph  26  of  the  determination  the
    Notice of Appeal did include as a ground  that  the  adverse  decisions
    were unlawful as incompatible with the Appellant's human rights and the
    family life ties relied upon emerged clearly  in  any  event  from  the
    witness statements made by the first Appellant and her husband.

 6.  On  18th  March  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Campbell   granted
    permission to appeal.  Judge Campbell noted that the assessment of  the
    evidence appeared in four  paragraphs  (paragraphs  21  to  24  of  the
    determination) and appeared to be based on  a  summary  which  appeared
    earlier (at paragraphs 15 to 18).  He considered that the assessment of
    the payslips appeared to take no account of the supporting  documentary
    evidence which included a letter from the Sponsor's employer and a  tax
    calculation.  Further he considered that the other reasons given by the
    judge for not accepting the Sponsor's evidence may, arguably, have been
    based on a misunderstanding of when  it  was  that  the  Sponsor  began
    working part-time and  regarding  the  date  of  incorporation  of  his
    employer.   Judge  Campbell  further  considered  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had erred at paragraph  26  in  stating  that  no  human
    rights point was raised in the Notice of Appeal  as  human  rights  are
    expressly relied upon (albeit  briefly) in the second  of  the  grounds
    appearing on page 7 of form IATF-2.

 7. On 31st March 2014 the Secretary of State filed and served  a  response
    to the Grounds of Appeal under Rule  24.   Those  grounds  opposed  the
    Appellant's appeal and at paragraphs 3 to 6 the Rule  24  response  set
    out factual challenges to the Grounds of Appeal.

 8. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  initially  to
    determine whether or not there is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.   The  Appellant  appears  by  his
    instructed Counsel Mr Bloomer.  The Secretary of State appears  by  her
    Home Office Presenting Officer Mr A McVeety.

Submissions/Discussion

 9. Mr Bloomer takes me to paragraph 5 of the Grounds  of  Appeal  pointing
    out that the Grounds of Appeal clearly stated the decision of the Entry
    Clearance Officer was unlawful because it  was  incompatible  with  the
    Appellant's rights under the European Convention on  Human  Rights  and
    that the issue was addressed by the Appellant and the Sponsor in  their
    witness statements.  He submits that the judge materially erred in  law
    in that he did not identify Article 8 as an issue  and  then  does  not
    apply the right  test.   He  has  made  no  reference  therein  to  the
    authority of Gulshan and that the appeal is fatally flawed in that  the
    judge has failed to apply basic principles under the test  set  out  in
    Razgar.  He submits on that point alone there must be an error of law.

10. He then set out to analyse the grounds  and  the  documents  that  were
    available and considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   He  points
    out that the entirety of the judge's decision is to be found  in  three
    paragraphs, paragraphs 22 to 24 of  the  determination.   Paragraph  22
    states "Putting the evidence of the Sponsor at its highest, is that  he
    did submit six months' payslips albeit that for three of  those  months
    he do not receive the money  represented  by  them  until  some  months
    later.  Such payslips are therefore fictitious..."

11. Mr Bloomer submits that this paragraph is demonstrably wrong.  He takes
    me to the document being the Halifax plc  statement  of  26th  November
    2012 pointing out that this document shows what the wage slips  specify
    but shows that there was a delay in some payments and that the  pay  of
    August 2012 by Scorp was delayed and that the payment made  in  October
    was in fact late but only seven days late.  He therefore  submits  that
    for the judge to conclude that such payslips are  therefore  fictitious
    is, to use Mr Bloomer's words, palpably untrue.

12. Mr McVeety responds by stating that at the hearing the Sponsor gave his
    evidence and therefore contends the judge had good grounds for  drawing
    his conclusions in that two different explanations were given  for  the
    delay in payment namely cash flow and that  the  Sponsor  was  on  sick
    leave and that this contradicts the evidence that was in the  Sponsor's
    witness statement.

13. Mr Bloomer points out that the Appellant's bundle  shows  that  he  was
    suffering from stress and that the judge has  fundamentally  failed  to
    address that issue. The fact remains that the Appellant  was  paid  and
    therefore the payslips cannot  be  fictitious.   Even  if  payment  was
    delayed he  still  earned  the  money  and  the  wage  slips  show  his
    entitlement to the money even if the money was not paid immediately.

14. Mr McVeety takes me to the Rule and refers me to Phelan page 1065  13th
    edition of the means by which gross annual income is  calculated  under
    Appendix FM.

         "13.     Based on evidence that  meets  the  requirements  of  this
             Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference to  the
             applicable provisions of  Appendix  FM,  gross  annual  income
             under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1.,  E-ECC.2.1.  and  E-
             LTRC.2.1. will be calculated in the following ways:


             (a)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at
                  the date  of  application,  has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for at least 6 months and has  been  paid
                  throughout the period of 6 months prior  to  the  date  of
                  application at a level of gross annual salary which equals
                  or exceeds the level relied upon  in  paragraph  13(a)(i),
                  their gross annual income will be (where  paragraph  13(b)
                  does not apply) the total of:


                  (i)  The level of gross annual salary relied upon  in  the
                      application;


                  (ii)  The gross amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income) received  by  them
                      or their partner in the 12 months prior to  the  date
                      of application; and


                  (iii)    The gross annual income  from  a  UK  or  foreign
                      State pension or a private pension received  by  them
                      or their partner."

15. Mr McVeety submits that following the Rule the Sponsor is working part-
    time and cannot meet the requirements anyway and  that  the  Notice  of
    Refusal states that the Sponsor says he was paid by BACS which  he  was
    not and therefore there is an issue of credibility over the money  that
    he received.  He submits that if the  Appellant  was  not  working  for
    three months in any event he is not able to meet  the  requirements  of
    the Rules.

16. Mr McVeety indicates it is necessary to look at the  total  wage  slips
    throughout the six month period and that the Sponsor was paid  a  total
    of �12,600 and quite simply by being paid those  amounts  he  satisfies
    the Rule and that this is an issue of fact rather than what was or  was
    not said at the hearing.  Mr McVeety did not  concede  that  point  and
    relies on the Rule 24 response.

17. Turning to the issue of stress Mr Bloomer points out that  it  was  not
    raised until after the immigration  decision  and  that  there  was  no
    significant reduction in the Sponsor's wage which is shown on the  wage
    slips that he received which are over the requisite limit and therefore
    in fact it does not matter whether or not the  Appellant  was,  or  was
    not, off work through stress.  Further so far as ground 3 is  concerned
    the document referred to Scorp Legal Services  not  Scorp  Limited  and
    that there has been a misunderstanding as to the two companies.   Scorp
    Limited was not incorporated until 27th March  2012  and  therefore  is
    referred to as a new company although Scorp  Legal  Services  had  been
    trading since 2006.  He submits the judge has made a fundamental  error
    in misunderstanding the position regarding the two companies.   Further
    he challenges the Immigration Judge's  comment  that  the  Sponsor  had
    failed to provide an explanation for the withdrawal of �2,700 from  his
    account.  He states that it was abundantly clear from evidence provided
    that the Sponsor had explained that he  had  withdrawn  the  money  for
    personal expenses (including car maintenance) and to send the Appellant
    some money via a friend.  He points out that it is inevitable that  the
    Sponsor would have had to have withdrawn some of his savings bearing in
    mind the delay in receiving his income and  that  the  bank  statements
    show quite clearly the Appellant's account was down to the sum of  �150
    when the three payments were made.  Mr  McVeety  acknowledges  that  on
    careful analysis the documents provided have come from Scorp and  shows
    that the company was the same company albeit that the company may  have
    changed its name.  He acknowledges that he is hampered  by  a  lack  of
    Record of Proceedings but  is  generous  enough  to  indicate  that  he
    understands the detailed explanation  that  has  been  provided  by  Mr
    Bloomer and the logic and reason why Mr Bloomer has followed a detailed
    paper trail to provide an explanation.

The Law

18.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

19. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that there are three material errors  of  law.   Firstly
    there are a number of factual errors in the findings of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge at paragraphs 22 and 23. Secondly he has  failed  to  do
    anymore than give the most brief analysis of his interpretation of  the
    evidence and in such circumstances I set aside those findings of  fact.
    Thirdly the judge has failed in any event to address the  issues  under
    Article 8.   There  is  a  requirement  if  an  Appellant's  appeal  is
    dismissed under the Rules to consider it outside the  Rules.   That  is
    the case providing this is raised in the Grounds of Appeal  and  it  is
    clear that those grounds have been raised.  I thus find that there  are
    material errors of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    and I set them aside.

Remaking of Decision

21.  The  burden  of  proof  is  on  the  Appellant  on  the   balance   of
    probabilities.  The submissions in this matter have been  very  largely
    of a factual basis particularly once  it  was  immediately  established
    (and accepted by Mr McVeety) the First-tier Tribunal Judge had erred in
    his failing to consider Article 8 outside the Rules once he had made  a
    finding that the case could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.

22. However  the  explanation  has  concentrated  on  whether  or  not  the
    Appellant does or does not meet the Rules.  The  Rule  is  set  out  at
    paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE insofar as it works  out  as  to  how  a
    Sponsor's gross  annual  income  is  calculated.   The  difficulty  the
    Sponsor has had has been based on a number of factors.

      i) The cash flow of his employers.

     ii) The time that he had to have off for stress but for  which  he  was
         paid.

    iii) The element of confusion as to the  exact  legal  entity  that  was
         paying him.

     iv) The Sponsor has provided a detailed explanation as  to  his  income
         and has also provided a detailed paper  trail  setting  out  income
         that he received for the six month period showing the payments made
         and the deferred payments and has supported this paper  trail  with
         documents from his bank, his wage slips and his employers.

    I acknowledge that the issues are complex and that could well have  led
    to the First-tier Tribunal Judge  being  misled  on  his  analysis  but
    having considered the documentation and the very  thorough  explanation
    that is provided to me by the Appellant's Counsel I am  satisfied  that
    evidence has been produced to show that the Sponsor over  the  relevant
    period had the requisite income to meet the financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM and consequently I am satisfied that the Appellant's appeal
    succeeds under the Immigration Rules.

23. Both legal representatives indicate that they do not require me in  the
    event that I am satisfied to go on further to consider the appeal under
    Article 8.

Decision

      1) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained a  material
         error of law and is set aside.

      2) The Appellant's appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

      3) The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not make  an  order  pursuant  to
         Rule 45(4)(i) of The Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
         Rules 2005.  No application is made to vary that order and none  is
         made.
