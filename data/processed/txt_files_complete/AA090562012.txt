For the Appellant:     Ms K Sj�voll of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr J Kingham, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission against a  determination  by  Judge  of
   the First-tier Tribunal Horvath dismissing the appeal on asylum and human
   rights grounds.

2) The appellant was born on 1 March 1992 and is a national of  Afghanistan.
    His asylum claim is based on a fear of  the  Taliban  arising  from  his
   father's position as a commander with  Hizbe-e-Islami.   The  appellant's
   father was killed in 2000 in a night time raid  by  the  Taliban  on  the
   family home.  Between 2000 and 2005 the appellant maintains that  he  was
   living with his maternal uncles  and  did  not  have  problems  with  the
   Taliban because they did not know where he was.  In 2005, when he was 13,
   he returned to his home village.  Shortly after his  return  the  Taliban
   attacked the family home at  night  but  they  were  frightened  away  by
   neighbours and other villagers who fired upon them.   The  appellant  was
   wounded in the attack.  Some time later the appellant was abducted by the
   Taliban and detained by them.  He was beaten, tortured and raped.  He was
   rescued by a shepherd from the hut in the mountains where  he  was  being
   held.  Around 2 or 3 months after this the appellant left Afghanistan.

3) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  noted  that  the  appellant  had  a
   previous appeal before the First-tier Tribunal in March 2011,  which  was
   dismissed.  Applications  to  seek  permission  to  appeal  against  this
   decision were unsuccessful.  The Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  took
   this previous determination as the starting point  for  consideration  of
   the current appeal, in terms of Devaseelan [2004] UKIAT 00702.

4) The appellant did not give oral evidence in the present appeal.   Instead
   reliance was placed on a number of medical reports which were not  before
   the Tribunal in  the  previous  appeal.   The  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal considered that there would be no good reason for disturbing the
   factual findings made in the previous appeal "unless the volume of  fresh
   medical evidence and/or expert country evidence now  produced"  was  such
   that  it  would  persuade  the  judge  to  reach  different  conclusions.
   Subsequently the judge found that there was no justification for reaching
   a different conclusion and relied upon the  adverse  credibility  finding
   made in the previous appeal.

5) The application for permission to appeal lists the fresh  evidence  which
   was before the First-tier Tribunal in the present  appeal.   The  medical
   evidence comprises:

     i) Psychiatric report by Professor Katona, dated 12 May 2011.


    ii) Medical report by Dr Juliet Cohen, Head of Medical Services at  the
        Medical Foundation, dated 16 June 2011.

   iii) Medico-legal report by psychotherapist Max Gillespie of the Medical
        Foundation, dated 2 September 2012.

    iv) Letter from Consultant Surgeon,  Mr  D  A  Browell,  Gateshead  NHS
        Foundation Trust, dated 29 March 2011.

6) The application also lists fresh country evidence, as follows:

     i) Expert report by Dr Antonio Giustozzi, dated 15 November 2012.


    ii) Amnesty International report by Paul  Dillane,  dated  21  November
        2012.

7) The grounds of the application for permission to  appeal  are  summarised
   as follows:

     i) the judge failed to consider adequate or at all the  report  of  Dr
        Cohen, and the assessment of the appellant's scarring,  and  failed
        to provide any or any adequate reasons for  placing  no  weight  on
        that scarring assessment;


    ii) the judge failed at all to consider the relevance  of  the  country
        evidence of Dr Giustozzi  to  the  credibility  assessment  of  the
        appellant;

   iii) the judge erred in dismissing the assessments of Professor  Katona,
        Dr Cohen and Max Gillespie on the basis that the authors  of  those
        reports made their diagnoses of the appellant having  assumed  that
        everything the appellant was telling them was true; and

    iv) the judge made material errors in her approach to the report of the
        psychotherapist, Max Gillespie.

8) In accordance with directions of the Upper  Tribunal  dated  20  February
   2013 the appeal was listed for hearing only on the  question  of  whether
   there was an error of law in the decision of the Judge of the  First-tier
   Tribunal.  The reason for this was that if an error of law was found  up-
   to-date medical reports would be required as well as  up-to-date  country
   information.

9) I should record that Mr Kingham, appearing on behalf of  the  respondent,
   did not have a number of the reports relied upon by the  appellant  prior
   to the day of the hearing.  These were made  available  to  him  and  the
   hearing  proceeded  in  the  afternoon.   I  would  like  to  record   my
   appreciation to Dr Kingham for allowing the appeal to proceed as  listed.
   I was also assisted by the written submission prepared by Ms Sj�voll.

10) I was addressed by Ms Sj�voll on behalf of the  appellant.   She  relied
   on  the  application  for  permission  to  appeal  and  on  the   written
   submission.  She pointed out that  Dr  Cohen  described  a  scar  on  the
   appellant's calf as typical of a high velocity wound.  According  to  the
   appellant this was the wound he received  when  the  Taliban  raided  his
   house and killed his father in 2000.  There was no medical report on this
   before the Tribunal in the earlier appeal.  In  the  present  appeal  the
   judge nevertheless found that Dr Cohen's report  was  not  sufficient  to
   revisit the credibility findings made in the previous appeal.  The  judge
   preferred an earlier report  by  Dr  Leggat  of  the  Medical  Foundation
   because Dr Leggat had seen  the  appellant  on  more  than  one  occasion
   whereas Dr Cohen had seen the appellant only once.  At  paragraph  45  of
   the determination the judge recorded that Dr Cohen had based her  opinion
   entirely on what the appellant had told  her  but  the  appellant  lacked
   credibility.

11) Ms Sj�voll continued that Dr Cohen had  given  evidence  in  her  report
   about the appellant's ano-rectal symptoms but  the  judge  had  concluded
   that there was no fresh  evidence  in  relation  to  these.   Ms  Sj�voll
   submitted that in relation to Dr Cohen's  report  the  judge  made  three
   fundamental errors in (1) ignoring Dr Cohen's evidence  as  to  the  high
   velocity wound, (2) assuming that Dr Cohen's opinion was  based  entirely
   on what the appellant had told her; and (3) finding  that  there  was  no
   fresh evidence  of  rape  notwithstanding  Dr  Cohen's  evidence  on  the
   appellant's ano-rectal symptoms.  Ms Sj�voll continued that the  scarring
   assessment by Dr Cohen was not based on the appellant's account but on  a
   clinical examination and analysis.   The  fact  that  Dr  Cohen  saw  the
   appellant only once should not detract from the weight to be given to her
   report.  Dr Cohen's conclusions were based on her own expertise and  were
   not tailored to the appellant's account.  The judge did not give adequate
   reasons for finding that Dr Cohen's report did not require  the  previous
   judge's findings on credibility to be revisited.

12) Ms Sj�voll then turned to the report by Dr Giustozzi.  At  paragraph  51
   of the determination the judge referred to the reports  of  Dr  Giustozzi
   and of Mr Dillane.  The judge observed that Dr Giustozzi's  opinion  that
   the appellant would be a target on return was essentially  based  on  the
   story as told to him by the appellant.  The judge stated that the  expert
   witnesses were not in a  position  to  verify  the  truthfulness  of  the
   appellant's story.  As the appellant's credibility had  been  discredited
   in the previous appeal and the findings made in the previous appeal  must
   stand, then the expert's reports were of limited assistance.

13) Ms Sj�voll submitted that Dr Giustozzi  was  an  expert  who  had  given
   evidence before numerous tribunals and whose evidence was  based  on  his
   own experiences and expertise.  He had not fitted his conclusions to what
   he was  told  by  the  appellant.   The  analysis  by  the  judge  of  Dr
   Giustozzi's report was inadequate and amounted to  a  material  error  of
   law.  That evidence was not before the judge in the previous  appeal  and
   it contained information which was not predicated on  the  truth  of  the
   appellant's account.  It was rather  independent  verification  that  the
   appellant's account might be plausible in the context of events happening
   in his district in 2000.  The Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  the
   present appeal failed to take this into account.

14) Ms Sj�voll observed in relation  to  the  reports  that  the  judge  had
   concluded that these were based on assumptions that the account given  by
   the appellant was true.  For example at paragraph 39 the  judge  observed
   that the report by Professor Katona was based  upon  a  history  provided
   directly to him by the appellant.  The judge  then  said  that  Professor
   Katona's expert opinion was essentially based on the story as told to him
   by the appellant.  In the report, however, Professor Katona had looked at
   the behaviour of the appellant  when  describing  his  symptoms  and  had
   described the state of "dissociation" when the appellant  was  describing
   his abduction.  This formed a part of his  diagnosis.   Professor  Katona
   found  the  appellant's  account  was  consistent  with  the  appellant's
   appearance and with the Professor's medical knowledge of the  effects  of
   PTSD.  Professor Katona had access to the  appellant's  medical  records.
   The judge was wrong to find that his  analysis  was  based  only  on  the
   appellant's version of events.   Professor  Katona  expressly  considered
   whether the appellant was exaggerating or faking his  symptoms  and  gave
   reasons for concluding this was not the case.   Ms  Sj�voll  pointed  out
   that in her report Dr Cohen  described  the  appellant's  demeanour  when
   talking about his experience of abduction in similar  terms  to  that  of
   Professor  Katona  and  considered  whether  the   appellant   might   be
   fabricating his account.

15) Ms Sj�voll referred to paragraph 34  of  the  determination,  where  the
   judge adressed the report by Max Gillespie.  The judge  stated  that  Max
   Gillespie was not in a position to factually  verify  the  truth  of  the
   appellant's account.   His  psychological  opinion  of  severe  PTSD  was
   essentially predicated upon the surmise that what the appellant told  him
   was the truth.  Ms Sj�voll submitted that according to Mr  Gillespie  his
   report was based on his own experience and the  appellant's  presentation
   and demeanour, which Mr Gillespie found consistent with  the  account  of
   torture and rape.  The  judge  did  not  adequately  consider  this.   At
   paragraph 30 the judge observed that the report by Mr Gillespie was based
   on 14 sessions with the appellant on a weekly basis but said that it  was
   unclear how long each session took.  This was contrary to Mr  Gillespie's
   report, which stated that the  sessions  were  generally  one  hour  long
   unless shortened.  The judge also questioned why the  sessions  were  not
   continued once the appellant was released from detention.  Had the  judge
   raised this issue at the hearing, which she did not, she would have  been
   informed that the sessions had been  resumed  following  the  appellant's
   release from immigration detention and were continuing at the date of the
   hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.  The judge made an error of  fact
   in this regard which affected the assessment of the evidence and amounted
   to an error of law.  The judge stated at paragraph 32  that  the  account
   the appellant had given to Mr Gillespie was different from the account he
   had given to UKBA but again the judge had misapprehended the evidence  in
   relation to this.  These errors were material.  Had the  judge  not  made
   these errors the assessment of credibility might have been different.

16) On behalf of the respondent, Mr Kingham submitted  that  the  judge  had
   considered the reports adequately and given full reasons for the findings
   made. The question before the judge was whether the  appellant  had  been
   targeted by the Taliban and would continue  to  be  targeted  on  return.
   None of the reports were of assistance in concluding that  the  appellant
   would be targeted on return because of his father's involvement in Hizbe-
   e-Islami.  A credibility assessment had been made by  the  judge  in  the
   previous appeal and this stood  up  to  the  subsequent  challenge.   The
   appellant had given an inconsistent account about the time  when  he  was
   shot in the leg and had said that this was 5 years after the Taliban shot
   his father.  The reports by Dr Cohen and Mr Gillespie  were  inconsistent
   with the  report  by  Dr  Leggat.   Following  the  previous  appeal  two
   applications for permission to appeal were  unsuccessful.   The  approach
   taken by the judge in the present appeal was justified.  The  psychiatric
   reports did not adequately address the  issues  raised  in  the  original
   appeal.  The report by Professor Katona was based on history provided  by
   the appellant and there was no material from  any  other  source.   In  a
   medical report it was difficult to identify the cause of trauma.  In  any
   event, how did the reports reach the conclusion that the appellant  would
   be at risk from the Taliban?  This was not covered by the country expert.
    Even though the scarring was of empirical value, this still  had  to  be
   shown to be consistent with the appellant's account and an assessment  of
   credibility had to be made.

17) Having considered the parties' submissions,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made an error of law in  consequence  of
   which the decision must be set aside.  Judge Horvath took  as  the  bench
   mark for consideration of the fresh evidence,  in  the  form  of  medical
   reports and country expert reports, the credibility findings made by  the
   judge in the previous appeal.  The flaw in this approach is that there is
   no basis for knowing what assessment of credibility would have been  made
   by the previous judge had these reports been before  her.   The  previous
   judge relied on a report by Dr Leggat but this report was not part of the
   evidence before the Tribunal in the present appeal.   I  agree  with  the
   submissions by Ms Sj�voll that the reasons given by Judge Horvath for not
   disturbing the previous credibility findings on  the  basis  of  the  new
   reports were wholly inadequate.

18) Mr Kingham submitted that the new reports did  not  deal  with  risk  on
   return and accordingly, even if the judge's approach to the  new  reports
   contained errors, this would not affect the outcome of the appeal.  I  do
   not agree with this submission.  Before a finding can be made on risk  on
   return in this appeal, it will be necessary to make  proper  findings  on
   the credibility of the appellant's account.  Judge Horvath did  not  give
   adequate reasons for the findings made in relation to the  assessment  of
   credibility.

19) I am satisfied that the nature or extent of any  judicial  fact  finding
   which is necessary in order for the decision to be re-made is such  that,
   having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to
   remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, in accordance with  Practice
   Statement 7.2(b).  The question the  First-tier  Tribunal  will  have  to
   address is whether the account on which the appellant bases his claim for
   asylum is credible having regard to the evidence now available about  the
   appellant's medical and psychological condition and the conditions in his
   country of origin.  This evidence  will  include  not  only  the  reports
   before the  Upper  Tribunal  but  any  up-to-date  reports  which  become
   available prior to the new hearing.  Some time will be required  for  the
   preparation of further reports and it would therefore be appropriate  for
   the appeal to be listed for a  Case Management Review hearing prior to  a
   substantive hearing.

                                  DECISION

20) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  on  points  of
   law such that it is set aside and will be re-made at  a  further  hearing
   before the First-tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

21) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)
   of the Asylum & Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
