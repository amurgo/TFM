                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 15 March  1979  and  was
    refused, on 29th November 2013, an extension of a Tier 1 (General) visa
    on the  basis  that  he  had  submitted  in  support  of  his  original
    application for Tier 1 leave, a false income which he had not earned.

 2. The appellant first entered the UK on 15 April 2012 with leave to enter
    as a student and subsequently his leave appeared to have been  extended
    until 22 October 2010. He was then given leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study Work) Migrant on 6 April 2011 until 6 April 2013.

 3. On 20 March 2013 the appellant applied for an extension of his  Tier  1
    leave and that application was refused as the respondent  asserted  she
    had contacted the HMRC and whereas the appellant had claimed,  on  14th
    September 2010 (in a  previous  application)  earnings  of  �37,000  in
    between 2009 and 2010, checks at the HMRC confirmed he had only  earned
    �6,290.  As such the Home Office concluded that refusal was appropriate
    under  paragraph   322(2)   of   the   Immigration   Rules   as   false
    representations had been made in an earlier application.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Seelhof  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules and an application for permission to appeal
    was made by the appellant's representative.

 5. The  application  for  permission  to  appeal  included  the  following
    grounds.  A single reason was given by the respondent in  the  decision
    of the respondent for  refusal  and  this  was  not  supported  by  any
    evidence.  The burden  and  standard  of  proof  as  described  in  the
    respondent's own published guidance referred to  the  burden  of  proof
    being  on  the  respondent  and  was  to   a   'higher   standard'   of
    probabilities.  The only reason for refusal, that  the  appellant  only
    earned �6,290 was abandoned by the respondent as it was an  unsupported
    allegation. The only document adduced was a witness statement from HMRC
    dated 10th October 2013  showing  income  only  from  employment.   The
    document was not complete as it did not contain  information  regarding
    income from self employment which was known to the HMRC at the time  of
    making the statement for which the appellant was paying tax.  The  only
    error by the appellant was in miscalculating his  tax  which  he  later
    rectified.   It is  only  where  the  appellant  had  deliberately  and
    dishonestly made a false statement in  an  application  that  the  rule
    applied.

 6. In the further grounds to the Upper Tribunal it was asserted  that  the
    burden of proof was entirely that of the respondent and  the  appellant
    was not required to rebut anything.

 7. The judge had further erred in relation to his approach  to  discretion
    and stated at [6] of his decision

    'in this case because the  alleged  deception  related  to  a  previous
    application the refusal is discretionary  but  it  is  clear  from  the
    decision that the Secretary of State has recognised that and has chosen
    to exercise a discretion to refuse the application'.

 8. It could be concluded from this that the judge considered that as  long
    as the Secretary of State had  exercised  the  discretion  it  was  not
    reviewable by the  Judge  and  that  was  incorrect.  The  exercise  of
    discretion was within one of the Rules and covered by Section  84(1)(f)
    of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The  Judge  failed
    to exercise his own discretion which was an error.

 9. It was also alleged that there was  improper  reasoning  as  the  judge
    found there were two possible outcomes that either  the  appellant  had
    deceived  the  respondent  or  alternatively  misled  the  HMRC.    The
    conclusion that the appellant had misled the respondent  was  based  on
    speculation and the judge  also  relied  on  evidence  not  before  the
    Tribunal.

10. Permission to appeal was refused by First Tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson
    but renewed to the Upper Tribunal and granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Storey on the grounds that improper reasoning was arguable.

Conclusions

11. In paragraph 6 the First-tier Tribunal judge stated

         "In cases where the Secretary of State alleges  dishonesty  on  the
         part of an applicant she  is  under  a  duty  to  provide  evidence
         capable of supporting that assertion and provided she does so  then
         it is open to an appellant to provide evidence in rebuttal.  I  can
         accept that there is no condition precedent which may have been  an
         error but I do note that the Tribunal continued to  state  that  it
         was for the Tribunal to assess  on  the  balance  of  probabilities
         whether there has in fact been deception."

12. This is  incorrect  further  to  NA  (Cambridge  College  of  Learning)
    Pakistan [2009] UKAIT 00031 which at [98] set out as follows.
         In JC (part 9, HC 395 - burden of proof) China [2007] UKAIT 00027
         the Tribunal reconfirmed its view that in respect of the general
         grounds of refusal the burden of proof rests on the respondent.
         That is also the position that the respondent takes, as can be seen
         from the IDIs, Section 4, Chapter 9: see above para 71. However, in
         JC although the Tribunal cited with approval the statement of
         Richards LJ in R (AN & Anor) v Secretary of State for the Home
         Department [2005] EWCA Civ 1605 that there is only a single civil
         standard, it also approved an earlier Tribunal decision which had
         made reference to allegations of deception or other criminal
         conduct requiring a standard of proof "at the higher end of the
         spectrum of balance of probability". In the light of the recent
         decisions of the House of Lords in Re: B (Children) and Re: Doherty
         the reference to a "spectrum of balance of probability" must be
         seen as incorrect, since it wrongly suggests that the civil
         standard of proof is a variable one. As their Lordships have
         clarified, citing with approval the same reference by Richards LJ
         in R (AN & Anor) to "a single standard of proof ... flexible in it
         application", the only way in which the greater seriousness of the
         allegation or of the consequences is of relevance is in relation to
         the necessary quality of the evidence. Just as JC must now be read
         with this correction, so must the Home Office IDIs which at para
         4.11 currently state (wrongly):
                 "Whilst the standard of proof rests on the balance of
                 probabilities, for matters of false representation and
                 documents it is a higher balance of probabilities than
                 normal."

13. That said,  as  I  conclude  below,  it  also  would  appear  that  the
    respondent had not produced the evidence which supported the claim that
    the appellant had only earned �6,290 and ignored further evidence.

14. I do however also find an error of law in  that  the  judge  relied  on
    evidence that was not before the Tribunal.

15. At paragraph 29 the judge stated:

         "I am  conscious  that  it  has  become  public  knowledge  amongst
         immigration advisors over the past two years that the  Home  Office
         is routinely going back and checking tax records for previous years
         and applications when applicants apply  for  extension  of  Tier  1
         visas.  I am aware of immigration discussion forums on the internet
         and other places where  this  is  discussed  publicly.  Although  I
         acknowledge there is some there is some speculation in  this  I  do
         consider that it is plausible that the appellant could  have  found
         out about these checks prior to applying to extend  his  visa,  and
         that he had then taken steps to ensure that his HMRC records  would
         reconcile with what he had clamed had been  the situation in 2010."

16. The fact is that this was not put to the appellant.

17. I note Miss Everett's riposte to the challenge that the judge  had  not
    exercised his discretion and it appeared the judge was of the view that
    as long as the respondent had addressed her mind to  the  existence  of
    the discretion the exercise of the discretion was not reviewable by the
    judge.  Although it does not appear from  [6]  and  a  reading  of  the
    decision, that the judge actually exercised his powers in  relation  to
    the discretion under paragraph 322(2), but merely couched  his  finding
    in respect of what the Secretary of  State  might  do  in  relation  to
    paragraph 322(5), that is historic conduct,  the judge would not  have,
    on his findings have exercised the  discretion  differently.   However,
    that argument and the argument in relation  to  improper  reasoning  is
    redundant in view of my other findings above.

18. I set aside the decision for the errors identified and which would have
    made a material difference to the outcome.  At the  subsequent  hearing
    before me, a decision was produced from the First-tier  Tribunal,  that
    is a decision dated 18 March 2011of Judge A E Walker in relation to the
    appellant's previous appeal.  This recorded that the  appellant made an
    application on 14 September 2010 for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant under the points-based system and this was refused on
    10 January 2011. His appeal was allowed.

19. The judge noted that two pieces  of  evidence,  being  an  accountant's
    letter and a set of financial accounts which the appellant produced  to
    the respondent,  did  not  corroborate  each  other,  but  nonetheless,
    referred to earnings in the region of �37,000  which  were  accumulated
    over a period of twelve months from 1 August 2009 to 27 August 2010.

20. The fact is that in relation to the earnings of the appellant from 2009
    to 2010 he subsequently and after a delay submitted  to  HMRC  that  he
    earned �37,586.  Evidence from the HMRC shows that some time  in  early
    2013 he alerted the HMRC and an assessment was sent to him dated 8  May
    2013 confirming that tax due on 31 January 2011 was �12,481.08.

21. At the date  of  his  appeal  hearing  for  his  2011  application  the
    appellant would have known the extent of his profit for  2009  to  2010
    his tax declaration was delayed but equally there was a letter on  file
    with HM Revenue and Customs in relation to a trading loss for the  year
    to 2011 of  �40,027.  I note that the dates given for  the  appellant's
    previous earnings in his new application range from 8 March 2012  to  7
    March 2013.

22. The appellant's explanation for the delay in accounting for tax on  his
    2009-2010 financial period, was that he had instructed someone who  was
    not a qualified chartered accountant and who had failed to  advise  him
    that he needed to pay the tax. When he did discover  this  he  promptly
    paid his  tax.  The  question  remains  that  the  appellant  submitted
    accounts showing that in the period 1 August 2009  to  27  August  2010
    that he had earned in excess of �37,000.  Subsequently, he was assessed
    to have owed this tax on 31 January 2011.  Thus  by  the  time  of  his
    refusal on 10 January 2011 and certainly by the time  of  the  Tribunal
    hearing in March 2011 the appellant was aware that he  had  earned  the
    sum of in excess of �37,000 and on which  he  relied  for  his  Tier  1
    Migrant visa, and on which he needed to pay tax and yet did not declare
    this to HMRC until 2013. That said, he explained his delay  by  way  of
    his accountant and this explanation cannot be discounted.

23. I put directly to the appellant  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Seelhof had suggested that he had read on forums on the internet  about
    the Secretary of  State  checking  visa  applicants'  tax  records  and
    effectively the necessity to get one's tax affairs into  order  and  he
    denied specifically that this was the case.

24. The difficulty with the respondent's case is that in the refusal letter
    dated 29 November 2013 it was stated that  on  14  September  2010  the
    appellant claimed earnings of �37,000 but after checks with  HMRC  they
    confirmed he only earned �6,290.  The fact is that this figure was  not
    borne out in the documentation submitted by the HMRC to the Home Office
    and submitted in evidence.  Indeed a witness statement was submitted by
    someone by the name of Phillip Morris in the documentation  who  stated
    on 10 October 2013 in relation to the appellant's tax year 2009 to 2010
    that the appellant in employment only had earned �18,660   an  entirely
    different figure from that on which the refusal of September  2013  was
    based.

25. Further and in particular, documentation produced by the appellant even
    to the First-tier Tribunal appeared to confirm that on 7 May  2013,  HM
    Revenue and Customs acknowledged that the appellant had written to them
    on 12 February 2013 noting that a liability of �12,481 arose for  2010.
    This was before the respodnent's decision was given in  November  2013.
    This was evidence that was not taken into account in  the  decision  of
    the respondent in assessing the matter further to Paragraph 322.

26. I conclude that dishonesty or deception is needed AA (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2012] EWCA Civ 1113, albeit not  necessarily  that  of  the  appellant
    himself, to render  a  false  representation  or  a  non-disclosure  of
    material facts to be dishonest and  the  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
    respondent.  The evidence provided in this case by the  respondent  was
    contradictory and did not satisfy me on the  balance  of  probabilities
    that the appellant had been dishonest.

27. That said I note that on this occasion the Secretary of State  had  not
    carried out full verification checks on the documents submitted as  the
    application fell for refusal on other grounds as outlined. I note  from
    the refusal letter that the Secretary of State states that they reserve
    the right to carry  out  this  assessment  in  any  challenge  of  this
    decision  or  in  future  applications.  I  cannot  conclude  that  the
    remainder of the Immigration Rules have been satisfied.

28. In addition the appellant by the time of the hearing before  me  stated
    that he had ten years continuous residence  in  the  UK  and  both  the
    representatives confirmed that further to 276B  the  matter  should  be
    returned to the Secretary of  State  for  a  lawful  decision  in  that
    regard. As such I return the matter to the Secretary of State in  order
    that she might exercise her discretion in that regard and for a  lawful
    decision.

29. I find there is an error of law  and  I  set  the  decision  aside  the
    decision in relation to the Immigration Rules  for  the  reasons  given
    above and I remake the decision.  The matter should be remitted to  the
    Secretary of State for a decision in accordance with the law.

Decision

Appeal Allowed to the extent that the matter is remitted  to  the  Secretary
    of State for a decision in accordance with the law.
