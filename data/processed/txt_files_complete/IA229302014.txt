                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The SSHD appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal against  the  decision  to
    refuse to vary her leave as a partner under Appendix  FM,  and  against
    her concomitant decision to remove her, because her  presence  was  not
    conducive to the public good (S-LTR 1.6) and because she had not  shown
    she was free  to  marry  her  British  national  sponsor  or  that  the
    relationship between them was genuine and subsisting.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that the claimant should be accorded anonymity for these proceedings in
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant admits a history of previous deception.  Apart  from  some
    differences  on  dates,  she  accepts  the  account  of   her   adverse
    immigration history given in the decision under appeal.

 3. The claimant is a national of Pakistan,  whose  date  of  birth  is  20
    October 1978.  In the identity of Rubana Qadeer ("RQ"), which the judge
    below found was her true identity, she  made  two  applications  for  a
    visit visa in July 2006, one after another, which  were  both  refused.
    On 13 September 2007 she applied for entry clearance as  a  visitor  in
    the identity of Rubana  Javed  ("RJ"),  date  of  birth  20.10.79.  The
    application was accompanied by a genuinely issued passport for  RJ.  In
    the application form, the claimant said she was  married  to  Mr  Javed
    Iqbal Anwar. The application was refused on 14 September 2007.

 4. On 23 November 2012 the claimant, in the identity of  RQ,  applied  for
    entry clearance from France as the fianc�e of Mr Amer Najeeb Latif.  In
    her application form, she failed to declare that she has been refused a
    visa on three previous occasions. Instead, she gave the answer "No"  in
    response to a specific  question  on  this  topic  (Question  42).  The
    application was refused on 6 February 2013 with a right  of  appeal  on
    the sole ground that the claimant  had  not  shown  that  she  met  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE. The  claimant
    appealed.

 5. While her appeal was pending, the claimant made  a  second  application
    for leave to enter a fianc�e.  In answer to Question 42,  she  declared
    the most recent refusal of a visa (the refusal in  February  2013)  but
    she did not declare the three earlier refusals.

 6. On 28 February 2013 the application was refused on the ground that  the
    claimant had failed to declare her  previous  application  in  a  false
    identity (identified through matching her  biometric  information)  and
    that she had previously claimed to be married, and so she could not  be
    confirmed as being free to marry her sponsor in the UK.

 7. The claimant did not appeal this refusal, but  continued  to  prosecute
    her appeal against the earlier refusal. Her appeal  came  before  Judge
    Sethi sitting at Hatton Cross  on  11  July  2013.  Both  parties  were
    legally represented. The ECO had failed to file a bundle in  accordance
    with Rule 13 of the 2005 Procedure Rules, but the legal representatives
    agreed that this did not prejudice  the  conduct  of  the  appeal.  The
    sponsor gave oral evidence, and  he  was  only  cross-examined  on  the
    documents evidencing his  annual  earnings  as  a  qualified  Chartered
    Engineer  and  a  director  of  Pall  Mall  Developments  Ltd.  In  his
    subsequent decision allowing the appeal, the judge noted  at  paragraph
    [17] that neither the ECO nor Mr Archie (who was the HOPO) had  put  in
    issue any of the remaining requirements under Section EC-P.

 8. On 28 August 2013 the claimant was granted limited leave to  enter  the
    UK as the fianc�e of Mr Latif until 28 February  2014.  On  23  October
    2013 she contracted a civil marriage to Mr Latif and on 3 January  2014
    the couple celebrated a religious marriage.

 9. On 27 February the claimant applied for leave to remain, using  a  form
    FLR (M). In answer to question 5.5, she  declared  that  she  had  been
    refused a visa in 2007, and in answer to  question  9.2,  she  admitted
    that she had used the RJ identity for the application in 2007.

10. On 16 May 2014 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing the
    claimant's  application  for  leave  to  remain,  and  for   making   a
    concomitant decision to remove her under Section 47 of the 2006 Act. As
    summarised by the judge below, the SSHD was of the view that it was not
    desirable to allow the claimant to remain in the UK due to her  actions
    which, while falling short of criminal behaviour, involved the  use  of
    deception, the deployment of false documents and the provision of false
    information.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. The appeal came before Judge Eban sitting at Richmond Magistrates Court
    on 27 March 2015. Mr  Blake  of  Counsel  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant. The SSHD was not represented. The claimant  and  the  sponsor
    gave oral evidence, and Judge Eban summarised their  evidence  in  some
    detail at paragraphs [7] to [10] of her subsequent decision.

12. The judge set out her findings of fact in paragraph [11]:

         "Having carefully considered what the witnesses told me  (which  is
         noted in the record of proceedings), I make the following findings:-



         ...

         2.   The [claimant's] true identity is Rubana Qadeer ...

         3.   The [claimant] was not married before her marriage to Mr  Amer
             Najeeb Latif. This is based on the [claimant's] evidence which
             I found to be credible.

         ...

         6.   The [claimant's] marriage to Mr Amer Najeeb Latif  is  genuine
             and subsisting. They are keen to start a family.

         ...

         8.   ... I find that at the time the [claimant] applied in a  false
             name she was under the control  of  her  male  relatives,  and
             accept that she would have little power  to do other than  she
             was told. I also accept the [claimant's] evidence that she was
             unsure what precisely her male relatives had  done,  and  what
             documents she was asked to sign or declarations  she  made.  I
             find  that  the  [claimant]  recalled  that   she   had   made
             applications, but did not know precisely  when,  or  what  was
             said  on  her  behalf  and  so  omitted  information   without
             realising the significance of doing so when she later  applied
             as a fianc�e.

         9.   Mr Amer Najeeb Latif has lived continuously in the UK for over
             40 years and could not integrate into life in Pakistan."

13. The judge went on to consider Article 8. At  paragraph  [17]  she  said
    that the rules were the starting point, and the claimant did  not  meet
    them. So the question which she had to decide was whether  there  would
    be unjustifiably harsh consequences not sufficiently  recognised  under
    the Rules if the claimant returned to Pakistan. She  gave  her  reasons
    for answering this question in the affirmative in paragraphs  [18]  and
    [19].

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

14. The ground of appeal was that the Judge had failed to give any  or  any
    adequate reasons for finding that the claimant was  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage and/or that the judge had failed  to  resolve  "the
    conflict  of  opinion"  on  whether  the  marriage  was   genuine   and
    subsisting. The judge had found  that  the  marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting, and that the claimant enjoyed family life with the sponsor,
    at [11.6] and [16]. But at no point in her decision  did  she  consider
    the evidence on this point and she provided no reason for her  finding,
    contrary to Budthathoki  (reasons  for  decisions)  [2014]  UKUT  00341
    (IAC).

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

15. On 10 June 2015 Judge Colyer granted permission,  as  it  was  arguable
    that the judge had failed to provide adequate reasons for  the  finding
    of fact that the claimant was in a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage,
    "[t]his being an issue at the heart of the appeal".

The Rule 24 Response

16. On 28 July 2015 the claimant's solicitors served an extensive  Rule  24
    response opposing the appeal, which had been settled by  Mr  Blake.  At
    paragraph 36, he submitted that it was plainly open to  the  judge,  on
    the totality of the evidence (both oral and documentary), to  make  the
    omnibus finding that the claimant and her spouse were  living  together
    in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.  Sufficient  findings  were
    rehearsed and others could be readily inferred. No  material  piece  of
    evidence was overlooked by  the  judge.  The  weight  which  the  judge
    afforded  to  certain  aspects  of  the   evidence,   while   attaching
    correspondingly little or no weight to other aspects,  lay  comfortably
    within the bounds of the standard of rationality: see Mukarkar  v  SSHD
    [2006] EWCA Civ 1045 at [39]-[41], Nixon [2014]  UKUT  00368  (IAC)  at
    [13] and Edwards v Bairstow  [1956] AC 14.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

17. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Ms Isherwood relied on The Queen on the application of  Agyarko  &
    Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA  Civ  440.
    She submitted that the judge had focussed too much on the sponsor,  and
    the adverse consequences for him if his wife's  appeal  was  dismissed,
    and had failed  to  engage  adequately  with  the  SSHD's  reasons  for
    doubting the claimant's true intentions, which included the lengths  to
    which she had gone to attempt to enter the UK in the past. The  judge's
    approach had been back to front. She had found that  the  marriage  was
    genuine and subsisting and that both parties to the marriage  genuinely
    intended to live together permanently in the UK as  husband  and  wife,
    before analysing why this might not be the  case  from  the  claimant's
    perspective, having regard to her immigration history.

18. Mr Blake took me through the documentary evidence which had been before
    the judge, and he submitted that on analysis the error of law challenge
    was one of irrationality in finding the claimant  credible  (cf  Nixon)
    rather than a lack of adequate reasoning (cf Budhathoki).

Discussion

19. The ground of appeal gains some traction because the  judge  omitted  a
    vital dimension of the SSHD's case when setting  it  out  at  paragraph
    [6]. The case for the SSHD was not simply that  the  claimant  did  not
    meet the suitability requirement at S-LTR 1.6. It was also part of  the
    SSHD's case that the claimant had, by her conduct, not shown  that  she
    met the eligibility requirements. The Rule 24 response is predicated on
    the premise that, once the claimant admitted  her  adverse  immigration
    history, the only factual issues  in  controversy  were  (a)  her  true
    identity and (b) whether she was free to marry. But  while  these  were
    important factual issues which needed to be resolved, another strand to
    the SSHD's case was that the claimant's past attempts to enter  the  UK
    called into question her true  motives  in  attaching  herself  to  the
    sponsor. In short, it was reasonable to question whether  the  claimant
    was cynically using the sponsor as a means to an end (to gain the right
    to settle in the UK); and that, by her past conduct, she had not  shown
    that she had a genuine intention to live together permanently with  him
    in the UK as husband and wife, and thus she  had  not  shown  that  the
    marriage was genuine and subsisting.

20. The judge's error  at  paragraph  [6]  is  compounded  by  the  judge's
    approach at paragraph [11]. She does not  expressly  engage  with  this
    particular concern of the SSHD (that the claimant is using the  sponsor
    as a means to an end) before making a  finding  that  the  marriage  is
    genuine and subsisting.

21. However, unlike the First-tier Tribunal judge in Budhathoki, Judge Eban
    rehearsed the evidence of the claimant in some detail before  declaring
    that she found her evidence to be credible. Part of  her  evidence  was
    that she had met the sponsor through a Muslim  on-line  dating  website
    when she  was  legally  resident  in  France,  working  as  a  teacher.
    Initially she had no idea where the sponsor lived. Moreover, as she was
    already living in Europe, she did not embark on a relationship with him
    so as to come to the UK by any means.

22. As Ms Isherwood submitted, it remains wholly unexplained why the family
    resorted to fraud in an unsuccessful attempt to secure her admission to
    the  UK  under  a  false  identity  in  2007.  But  the  absence  of  a
    satisfactory explanation for the conduct in 2007 did not  preclude  the
    judge from finding that the claimant was credible as to her motives  in
    seeking entry clearance as a fianc�e in 2012.

23. The finding at paragraph [11.6] is supported by the undisputed  finding
    at [11.5] that the parties entered into a civil marriage, followed by a
    religious one, both of which  are  documented,  There  was  also  other
    documentary evidence in the bundle which was supportive of the finding,
    comprising photographs and emails  which  were  exchanged  between  the
    couple in 2011 at an early stage of their courtship.

24. The finding at paragraph [11.6] cannot be viewed in isolation from  the
    other findings made by the judge, nor should it be  divorced  from  the
    reasoning which underpins those  other  findings.  None  of  the  other
    findings of fact are challenged by the SSHD, including the finding that
    it was not the claimant who decided to try to enter the UK in 2006  and
    2007.  This was a decision taken by male  members  of  her  family  who
    exercised control over her.

25. The significance of Agyarko is that it provides a  springboard  for  an
    argument by the SSHD that there were not exceptional  circumstances  in
    this case which justified the claimant being granted Article  8  relief
    outside the rules. But there is  no  error  of  law  challenge  to  the
    judge's assessment of proportionality, and Ms Isherwood confirmed  that
    she was not seeking to add a new ground of appeal. The decisive  factor
    which tipped the scales in the claimant's favour  was  that,  following
    her successful  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  on
    financial grounds, the ECO had granted her entry clearance as a fianc�e
    despite having actual or  constructive  knowledge  of  her  history  of
    deception (when it was open to him to invoke this as a ground  for  not
    issuing her with a visa), and  he  had  thus  engendered  a  legitimate
    expectation on her part and on the part of the sponsor that they  would
    be allowed to establish family life together in the UK;  and  that  her
    past would not derail an otherwise meritorious application for  limited
    leave to remain as a spouse. The reasoning of the Judge on the issue of
    proportionality is sound, and the fact that a different Tribunal  might
    have reached a contrary conclusion on the same facts, applying Agyarko,
    is irrelevant.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly  the  decision  stands.  The  SSHD's  appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal is dismissed.

Anonymity

I make no anonymity direction.
