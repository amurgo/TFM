                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, instructed by Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  for  reasons
    explained in her letter dated23 March 2017.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge S T Fox dismissed the appellant's appeal  for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 18 May 2017.

 3. The appellant states his grounds of appeal to the UT in his application
    filed on 18 October 2017:

      (i) The FtT considers the failure of the appellant to claim asylum  in
      Hungary at �14 - 15 ... in implementation  of  s.8  of  the  2004  Act
      [which] provides that a judge should take such matters ... as damaging
      to ... credibility ... the FtT has erred in law in the  assessment  of
      ... credibility and placed undue weight on this one finding.

      (ii) The FtT demonstrates a further disregard of material facts at �14
      and  constitutes  [sic]  the  appellant's  claim  that  the  Hungarian
      authorities instructed him to "move on" as "wild and  fanciful".  This
      is a known practice in this country  and  should  be  within  judicial
      knowledge as such.

      (iii) A significant degree of speculation has been applied in order to
      reach  a  negative  credibility  finding  ...  at  �12  ...:  "in  all
      probability he left Iran illegally" ... this was not suggested by  the
      respondent or the judge at the  hearing.  This  is  a  negative  point
      against the appellant and it is ... unfair that the appellant was  not
      placed on notice ... and given  the  opportunity  to  rebut  any  such
      concern.

 4. In his  skeleton  argument  Mr  Winter  advanced  a  further  point  as
    "Robinson-obvious":

      (iv) ... some of the findings are unclear. In particular although  the
      FtT reaches findings at �40 it is unclear whether these relate to  the
      appellant's membership of Komala or whether they relate  also  to  the
      smuggling of materials for Komala or both (see �22 - 25, 30, 33  -  34
      which appear to  support  the  position  of  smuggling  materials  for
      Komala). The unclear findings have coloured the approach of the FtT as
      if it is accepted  he  at  least  smuggled  materials  for  Komala  an
      assessment would have to be made in terms of the country guidance (CIG
      on Kurds) in conjunction with the country guidance case law of SSH  as
      to whether the appellant would nevertheless be at  risk  of  at  least
      being perceived as supporting Komala in relation to the  smuggling  of
      materials for Komala. It is not inevitable that  another  judge  would
      reach the same finding.

 5. (The numbering (i) - (iv) has been added for ease of reference.)

 6. Having considered the grounds and submissions, I find that no error  on
    any point of law is disclosed.

 7. Ground (i) fails to make any proposition of legal error.  It is a  bare
    disagreement with the weight given to one aspect of the case.

 8. The s.8 point is only one of many reasons for  the  FtT's  conclusions.
    The ground advances nothing to show that it was given more weight  than
    it could properly bear.

 9. Ground (ii) does not refer to any evidence  of  the  practices  of  the
    Hungarian authorities.  There was none before  the  judge.   There  has
    been no attempt to produce such evidence since.

10. The appellant has not begun to show that the alleged practices  of  the
    Hungarian authorities are so well established by evidence in the public
    or jurisdictional domain that they  call  for  no  proof  and  must  be
    automatically assumed by FtT judges.

11. The facts are that the Hungarian authorities documented the appellant's
    presence in the country, fingerprinted him, and circulated  details  to
    other  EU  countries.   As  Mrs  O'Brien  argued,  those  are  powerful
    indications that they dealt with the appellant appropriately,  and  did
    not simply "wave him on" so as to pass a problem elsewhere.

12. Ground (iii) complains of  a  finding  made  without  notice,  but  the
    finding of illegal  departure  tends  in  the  appellant's  favour  not
    against him.  Any complaint would lie with the respondent, not  on  his
    side.

13. Ground (iv) is not obviously well-founded.  It depends on  reading  the
    decision in a  rather  compartmentalised  and  point-by-point  fashion,
    rather than fairly and as a whole.

14. The appellant seeks an interpretation that although he  was  found  for
    good reasons not to have had any political motivation, the judge leaves
    it open that he may have smuggled politically dangerous materials.

15. The appellant's credibility is rejected for numerous  good  reasons  in
    which no error is alleged.   That  includes  his  suggestions  that  he
    placed his family in any danger, had dangerous materials at home to  be
    discovered by the Ettela'at, and left friends and colleagues in a risky
    situation without giving thought to tipping them off.   Those  negative
    elements do not sit logically with the interpretation sought.

16. The overall rejection is in such clear terms  as  to  leave  no  doubt,
    e.g., �47, "not a good witness as to fact and truth.  His evidence  may
    not be relied upon", and �48, "... the core ... lacks  credibility  and
    is a fabrication".

17. The reading that the  judge  may  have  accepted  that  the  appellant,
    although otherwise not credible, was an unintentional pawn in  a  risky
    political game is not a sustainable one.

18. The FtT judge who refused permission commented on the extent  of  error
    apparently  arising  from  transcription  from  a  digitised  dictation
    application, and the UT judge who  granted  permission  found  it  very
    difficult to discern the meaning of some passages.  The  decision  does
    contain more slips than it should, but its  overall  reasoning  remains
    clear.

19. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

20. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
