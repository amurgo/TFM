Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Duffy (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms Kabir (Legal Representative)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan. The first-named appellant came
    to the United Kingdom legally on July 11, 2003 and June 14,  2006.  The
    second-named appellant made a number  of  legal  trips  to  the  United
    Kingdom on February 25, 2011, October 25, 2001, July 11, 2003 March 26,
    2004  and  finally  July  14,  2006.  The  two  adult  appellants  have
    overstayed since their respective visas expired on September 29,  2006.
    Both the third and fourth named appellants  were  born  in  the  United
    Kingdom but neither are British citizens.

 3. Each appellant applied for further leave to remain  and  initially  the
    respondent refused their applications with no right of  appeal  due  to
    the fact the adult appellants were  overstayers.  Following  a  consent
    order in the Administrative Court  on  April  29,  2014  fresh  removal
    decisions were issued in respect of each appellant on July 25, 2014.

 4. The appellants appealed on August 6, 2014 under section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. The matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Randall
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on September 10, 2014 and in  a
    decision promulgated on November 5, 2014  he  allowed  the  third-named
    appellant's appeal under paragraph 276ADE  HC  395  and  the  remaining
    appeals under article 8 ECHR.

 6. The respondent lodged grounds of  appeal  on  November  11,  2014.  She
    submitted the FtTJ erred by failing to apply the approach in R  (Nagre)
    v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and EV (Philippines) & Ors v SSHD [2014]
    EWCA Civ 874 and by failing to have full regard to Section 117 B of the
    Immigration Act 2014.

 7. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cruthers granted permission to  appeal
    on December 15, 2014 stating there was an arguable errors in law  based
    on the grounds.

 8. The appellants were all in attendance in court and were represented  as
    set out above.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 9. Mr Duffy submitted the FtTJ's approach was contrary to the  established
    approach set out in the cases of Gulshan (article 8-new  rules-correect
    approach) [2013] UKUT 640 and EV. In any event  the  FtTJ  concentrated
    wholly on the third appellant and whilst paragraph  276ADE(iv)  HC  395
    allows a child under 8 who had lived here to  remain  on  private  life
    grounds he should only do so  where  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect her to leave the United Kingdom. Mr Duffy submitted the FtTJ had
    materially erred in his assessment of the second part of the test as he
    had considered this appellant's appeal in isolation to the rest of  the
    family. As the Court  stated  in  EV  the  court  should  consider  the
    application in the real world. The FtTJ made several  adverse  findings
    and failed to  attach  sufficient  weight  to  these  findings  and  he
    submitted any disruption by  removal  would  not  render  the  decision
    unreasonable. The adult family members had overstayed  since  2006  and
    the family have a poor immigration history. The FtTJ failed  to  attach
    sufficient weight to this or the fact he found that the family could be
    removed and still be supported by family from the  United  Kingdom.  ZH
    (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 says being British not a trump card but  third
    appellant was being used as a trump card and this was  unreasonable  as
    her claim should not be looked at in isolation. He submitted there  was
    an error in law.

10. Mr Jafar rejected Mr Duffy's submissions and  submitted  there  was  no
    identifiable error of law as the FtTJ had  not  misapplied  either  the
    Rules or Regulations. At paragraph  [15]  the  FtTJ  accepted  most  of
    appellants' evidence and even  made  clear  that  he  found  the  adult
    appellants had embellished or played down some of their  evidence.  The
    FtTJ recorded they were here  for  economic  reasons  but  he  properly
    considered the case of EV at paragraph 15.2 of his determination and at
    paragraphs 15.4 and 15.5 he considered the best interests of the third-
    named appellant. He concluded at the end of paragraph  15.5  that  what
    was in the third-named appellant's best interest was not the end of the
    matter and he then continued to assess all the other factors  and  from
    paragraph 15.8 onwards he considered all of the available evidence  not
    only about the third-named appellant but all of the appellants  and  he
    gave reasons for making the findings  he  did.  Having  considered  the
    evidence he then considered Section 117B of the 2002 and in  particular
    subsection (vi) and he made positive findings in respect of all of  the
    appellants. Having considered  all  of  the  evidence  he  allowed  the
    appeals  as  outlined  above.  There  as  no  error  in  law  and   the
    respondent's submissions was a mere disagreement.

11. Having heard the representations I indicated I would  be  refusing  the
    respondent's appeal and that  I  would  give  written  reasons  for  my
    decision.



    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT AND DISCUSSION


            DECISION

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose  an  error  in
    law. The original decision shall stand in its entirety.

13. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. An
    order was not made in  the  First-tier  but  as  there  are  two  young
    children involved I make an anonymity order with all  the  consequences
    that flow from that order.
