                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless for the purposes of this appeal I shall refer  to
    the parties as they were described before the First-tier Tribunal, that
    is Mr Shreshtha as the appellant and the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    respondent.

 2. On 30 August 2014 the appellant submitted an application for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of  a  settled  person.  His
    application was considered under Appendix FM and  paragraph  276ADE  of
    the  Immigration  Rules.   It  was  decided  that  the  appellant   had
    previously obtained a test from ETS on 6 February 2013 to  support  his
    application dated 30 April 2013.  This test was subsequently  cancelled
    as deception had taken place and the validity of the test result  could
    not be  authenticated.  He  therefore  did  not  meet  the  suitability
    requirements under S-LTR2.2(a).

 3. In order to qualify for limited leave to  remain  as  a  partner  under
    Appendix FM  the requirements  are  -  LTRP1.1  must  be  met  and,  in
    addition, to qualifying under suitability the applicant must

      i. Meet all the eligibility requirements of Appendix FM E-LTRP or

     ii. Meet the eligibility requirements of Appendix FM E-LTRP1.2 to  1.12
         and 2.1 and in addition the applicant  meets  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM EX.1.

 4. With reference to R-LTRP1.1(ii) it was considered  that  the  appellant
    did not meet the requirements  because  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with  the  client's  partner  continuing  from
    outside the UK and therefore he failed to meet EX.1.

 5. Further the appellant did not meet  the  requirements  under  paragraph
    276ADE.

 6. The matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  K.St.J.
    Wiseman.  He found  that  there  was  no  supporting  documentation  or
    witness  statement  provided  with  respect  to  the  allegation   that
    deception had  been  made  in  relation  to  the  previous  application
    (paragraphs 22 and 23).

 7. The judge then found that the appellant's partner and sponsor  did  now
    (my italics) earn sufficient money and there were appropriate  payslips
    showing earnings of �506 per month gross her employer for the last five
    months (with a further one to come in the end of this month".

         "26. She does now earn sufficient; there are  appropriate  payslips
             showing earnings of �608 per month gross from Monty's for  the
             last five months (with a further one to come  in  the  end  of
             this month); there are payslips from Sodexho covering  a  very
             much longer period but certainly for in excess of  six  months
             showing gross pay in there region of �1,190 per  month;  there
             are her Metro bank statements clearly showing the relevant net
             figures going in each month; there is a contract of employment
             from Sodexho and a letter of employment from  Monty's.   There
             is more than enough evidence in accordance with the  Rules  to
             prove the sums paid. The regular sums in  question  reflect  a
             total  gross  salary  of  close  to  �20,000  per  annum,  and
             certainly  significantly  more  than  the  Immigration   Rules
             require. In addition, it  is  not  disputed  that  this  is  a
             genuine and subsisting marriage and the couple have rent  free
             accommodation with the wife's parents on an open ended  basis.
             All figures up to the date of this appeal hearing can be taken
             into account as it is an in-country appeal."

 8. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    judge had made a material misdirection in the law because in respect of
    the  evidence  to  be  produced  regarding  salaried  employment  under
    Appendix FM-SE.

 9. Paragraph 2 of FM-SE states:

         "2.  In respect of salaried employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
             paragraph 9 applies), all of the following  evidence  must  be
             provided:

             (a)  Payslips covering:

                  (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application
                      if the person has  been  employed  by  their  current
                      employer for at least 6 months (and  where  paragraph
                      13(b) of this Appendix does not apply); or

                  (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of 12
                      months prior to the date of application if the person
                      has been employed by their current employer for  less
                      than 6 months (or at least 6 months  but  the  person
                      does not rely on paragraph 13(a) of  this  Appendix),
                      or in the financial year(s) relied upon  by  a  self-
                      employed person.

             (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips  at
                  paragraph 2(a) confirming:

                  (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;

                  (ii) the length of their employment;

                  (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid
                      the level of salary relied upon in  the  application;
                      and

                  (iv)  the  type  of  employment   (permanent,   fixed-term
                      contract or agency).

             (c)   Personal  bank  statements  corresponding  to  the  same
                  period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing  that
                  the salary has been paid into an account in  the  name  of
                  the person or in the name of the person and their  partner
                  jointly.

             (d)  Where the person is a director of a limited company based
                  in the UK, evidence that the company  is  not  of  a  type
                  specified in paragraph 9(a). This can include  the  latest
                  Annual Return filed at Companies House.

             (e)  Where a person appointed as a non-executive director of a
                  limited company based in the UK, which is not a company of
                  the type specified  in  paragraph  9(a),  is  paid  a  fee
                  instead of a  salary,  this  income  may  be  treated  and
                  evidenced as though it were income received for employment
                  in that capacity."

10. The respondent asserted that the judge was not entitled  to  find  that
    the full Rule R-LTRP1.1(c) was  met  in  the  circumstances  where  the
    sponsor was relying on income that had only arisen since  the  date  of
    application.  The judge should have considered  whether  R-T-LTRP1.1(d)
    was met which would entail consideration of EX.1.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever who
    noted that the judge had noted at  paragraph  5  that  the  appellant's
    representatives conceded that the appellant did  not  meet  the  income
    threshold at the date  of  the  application  and  that  the  judge  had
    arguably  erred  in  considering  post-application  income  with   some
    documentation not available.

The Hearing

12. At the  hearing  Mr  Melvin  relied  on  the  written  application  for
    permission to appeal and stated that the judge had taken  into  account
    evidence which he was not entitled do so.

13. Mr Khan acknowledged that at the time of the  application  the  sponsor
    could not meet the threshold but this was an in-country appeal and  the
    appellant was entitled to  adduce  post-decision  evidence  further  to
    Section 85A of the Immigration and Asylum Act.

14. Mr Melvin submitted that the Rules in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]  EWCA  985
    clearly indicated that that was not the case.

Conclusions

15. I find in conclusion that it is clear from paragraph 26 of the  judge's
    determination that he took into account payslips showing  earnings  for
    the "last  five  months".   This  is  evidence  which  post  dates  the
    application.  Evidence must be  submitted  with  the  application.  The
    income from Sodexho does not reach the �18,600 threshold and the  judge
    took into account that there was going to be "a further one to come  in
    the end of this month" in relation to the income from Monty's.

16. It is clear from Appendix FM-SE D(a) that

         "In deciding an application in  relation  to  which  this  appendix
         states  that  specified  documents  must  be  provided  the   Entry
         Clearance Officer or the Secretary of State  'the  decision  maker'
         will  consider  documents  that  have  been  submitted   with   the
         application and will only consider documents  submitted  after  the
         application where subparagraph (b) or (e) applies."

17. Subsections (b) and (e) do not apply in the case of the appellant.   It
    is further stated at Appendix FM  -SE paragraph 2  that  the  following
    evidence must be provided:

         "(a) payslips covering

             (i)  a period of six months prior to the date  of  application
                  if the person has been  employed by their current employer
                  for at least six months (and where at paragraph  30(b)  of
                  this appendix does not apply); or

             (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of twelve
                  months prior to the date of application if the person  has
                  been employed by their current employer for less than  six
                  months (or at least six months but  the  person  does  not
                  rely on paragraph 13(a) of this appendix."

18. The appellant could not show,  as  at  the  date  of  the  application,
    payslips covering the relevant  periods  and  therefore  the  decision,
    which took into account later evidence was in legal error to a material
    degree.

19. That said, there was no decision in  relation  to  paragraph  EX.1  and
    Article  8  was  not  addressed.   At  the  hearing  Mr  Melvin  sought
    permission to submit further evidence in relation  to  the  appellant's
    previous deception in relation to ETS.  As the decision  has  been  set
    aside and in view of the findings to be made in  relation  to  EX1  and
    Article 8, I would have  allowed  Mr  Melvin's  application  to  submit
    further evidence but in the event this would not be necessary  as  both
    parties  agreed  that  the  matter  should   be   remitted   in   these
    circumstances to the First-tier Tribunal because the nature and  extent
    of the findings to be made.  Both parties are on notice to  submit  any
    further evidence as least 28 days prior to the substantive  hearing  on
    both the opposing party and the Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The Judge erred materially for the  reasons  identified.  I  set  aside  the
decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals   Courts   and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and  extent  of
the findings to be made the matter should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007 and further to 7.2  (b)
of the Presidential Practice Statement.
