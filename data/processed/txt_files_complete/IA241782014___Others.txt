                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants born respectively on 18th June 1997, 27th  January  2001
    and 6th December 1960 are all citizens of Sri Lanka and the  first  two
    Appellants are daughters of the third Appellant.  The  Appellants  were
    represented by Mr Talacchi of Counsel.  The Respondent was  represented
    by Miss Vijiwala a Home Office Presenting Officer.

Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellants had made application to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    indefinitely as the spouse of a settled person together  with  her  two
    children as dependants under the Immigration Rules.   The  applications
    had been refused by the Respondent on 9th May 2014.  The Appellants had
    appealed that decision and the appeal was heard by Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Andrew sitting at Birmingham on 15th  October  2014.   He
    allowed the appeal.

 3. The Respondent made application for permission to appeal on  the  basis
    that the judge had failed to  consider  an  essential  feature  in  the
    Appellants' case raised by the Respondent.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Judge Brunnen on 23rd November 2014.  Directions were issued
    that the matter should come before the Upper Tribunal to firstly decide
    whether an error of law had been made or not.

 4. The matter came before me at Field House on 23rd January 2015 and in  a
    decision promulgated on 6th February 2015 I found a material  error  of
    law was made by the judge in this case for reasons set out  within  the
    decision and  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Directions were issued on 6th February 2015 and the matter comes before
    me to remake that decision in terms of the directions set.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 5. As the parties were present I firstly explained to them the  nature  of
    the proceedings and the manner in which they  would  be  conducted.   I
    next examined the documents available to me in this case.

 6. The Respondent's documents consist of:

       . immigration history;

       . those documents listed at folios A to C on the index sheet  to  the
         bundle;

       . refusal letter;

       . full copy refusal letter.

 7. The Appellants' bundle consists of:

       . initial bundle containing those documents listed at pages 1  to  48
         on the index sheet;

       . new bundle dated 20th  February  2015  containing  those  documents
         listed at pages 1 to 79 on the index sheet.

 8. The adult Appellant was called to give  evidence.   She  confirmed  her
    name and address and confirmed her witness statement of 23rd July  2014
    at page 3 of the original bundle was true and correct.  She  said  that
    both her children were studying at school and college.  She  said  they
    lived with them and were supported by herself  and  her  husband.   She
    said they had a four bedroom home.  There was no  questions  in  cross-
    examination.

 9. The Appellant's husband  and  Sponsor  was  next  called  and  he  also
    provided his name and address as on file.   He  confirmed  his  witness
    statement of 8th October 2014 was true.  He said  that  he  worked  for
    Interplex as a machine operator in packaging doing ten to twelve  hours
    per day or 55 to 60 hours per week earning �8 an hour.  He said that he
    had started with Interplex on 2nd June 2014.  The rent  at  their  home
    was �700 monthly.  He provided a history of his employment stating that
    he had worked between April 2011 and April 2012  at  Interplex  earning
    �22,498 in that year.  In the tax year April 2012 to April 2013 he  was
    employed at a newsagents earning �3,460.  In the tax year April 2013 to
    April 2014 he said he  had  also  worked  at  the  newsagents  and  had
    earnings of �7,205 according to  the  HMRC  records.   From  June  2014
    onwards he said he had returned to work at Interplex  and  was  earning
    �370 per week as a net income  giving  him  a  total  I  calculated  of
    �18,500 annually.  He said money from his employment went into his HSBC
    Bank.  He said there were no up-to-date statements of pay as  documents
    had been given to his solicitors some time  ago.   He  confirmed  there
    were no bank statements for the current period.  He said the  rent  was
    paid in cash.  He said he did not withdraw the rent  all  in  one  lump
    sum.

10. I heard submissions on behalf of  the  Respondent  who  submitted  that
    there was no evidence of his income.

11. In submissions on behalf of the Appellants it was said that the benefit
    threshold was �246.36 weekly and that working tax credit and child  tax
    credit could  be  put  into  the  equation  but  it  was  accepted  the
    Respondent said the shortfall on the HMRC records was over �130 weekly.
     It was submitted that on an average wage from Interplex of �319 a week
    there was a sufficiency of funds.

12. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision to consider the
    documents and evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with  my
    reasons.

Decision and Reasons

13. In this case the burden  of  proof  lies  on  the  Appellants  and  the
    standard of proof required for both immigration and human rights issues
    is a balance of  probabilities.   As  the  Appellants  are  within  the
    country I am entitled to look at circumstances existing as at the  date
    of hearing.

14. At the error of law hearing it became clear that  there  had  been  two
    issues raised by the Respondent in the full  refusal  letter.   Firstly
    the Respondent did not accept that the Appellants could  be  maintained
    without recourse to public funds, given the lack of  evidence  relating
    to the Sponsor's earnings  or  income.   Secondly  the  Respondent  had
    raised concerns as  to  whether  this  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage.  As explained in the error of law decision, the Judge at  the
    First-tier Tribunal had not dealt with, and seemingly  was  unaware  of
    the issue of maintenance.  He had however dealt with  the  question  of
    whether this was a genuine  marriage  and  had  concluded  for  reasons
    provided that it was a genuine marriage.  There was no error of law  in
    that decision and that finding was preserved.

15. Accordingly I needed to consider the sole question of  maintenance  and
    accommodation raised by the Respondent under paragraph 287(iv) and (v).
     The concerns and points raised by the Respondent appear at pages 2 and
    3 of the refusal letter dated 9th May 2014.

16. As indicated in the error of law decision it was clear  the  judge  was
    unaware of this issue having not been supplied with  the  full  refusal
    letter.  It is less than clear why this was not drawn to his  attention
    by either the Presenting Officer or the Appellants'  Counsel.   It  was
    also not entirely clear whether the  Appellants  and  their  solicitors
    were aware of this issue.  However as noted in that  previous  decision
    there was some indication from the Appellant's  witness  statement  and
    some documents supplied within the Appellants' bundle to  suggest  that
    they may have been aware that  maintenance  and  accommodation  was  an
    issue rather than simply the genuineness of the marriage.  For  example
    at paragraph 21 of the Appellant's witness statement  she  stated  "The
    Home Office are clarifying about my husband's income.  My husband is  a
    British citizen and is earning �13,000 per month".

17. The Home Office in their refusal letter had noted that the  amounts  of
    money put by the Appellant  on  her  application  form  did  not  match
    official documentation in the HMRC form.  It was further noted that the
    bank statement supplied did not match  official  figures  nor  provided
    evidence of income, rent paid or child benefit paid.

18. Even if the Appellants and their solicitors were uncertain  as  to  the
    issue  of  maintenance  at  an  earlier  stage  they  have  now  had  a
    sufficiency of time in which that matter is  clearly  an  issue  and  a
    sufficiency  of  time  to  produce  documentation  or  explanation   to
    demonstrate the question of accommodation and  maintenance.   Indeed  a
    further Appellants' bundle was served on 20th  February  2015  which  I
    anticipated would clarify matters.  However the position is  less  than
    clear and the documents within the fresh bundle do not put beyond doubt
    the concerns.

19. I deal with the  documents  that  do  appear  within  both  Appellants'
    bundles bearing in mind the burden of proof lies with the Appellants.

20. The tenancy agreement at page 13 first bundle shows the family lived at
    12 Cedar Terrace from 23rd October 2011 at a monthly rental  income  of
    �750.  At the date of application in January 2014 the parties  were  at
    the same address.  However page 8 first bundle shows the parties  moved
    to their current address at 63 Dashwood Avenue in March 2014 at a  rent
    of �950 per month.  There is a fresh tenancy  agreement  for  the  same
    property dated 1st December 2014  at  page  74  of  the  second  bundle
    showing the rent paid reduced to �700 per month,  consistent  with  the
    Appellant and Sponsor's oral evidence. As to why the rent on  the  same
    property had reduced by �250  per  month  in  a  short  period  remains
    unexplained.  There has been no independent evidence provided  such  as
    standing orders from a bank statement or rent book.  There is  recorded
    on the new tenancy  agreement  a  handwritten  note  stating  that  the
    Sponsor was previously sharing with another person, but now  as  he  is
    not  and  he  shares  with  his  family  alone  the  rent  is  reduced.
    Ordinarily one would have expected his rent to have been less if he was
    sharing previously.  Accordingly that reversal  of  the  norm  seems  a
    little unusual.

21. Turning to the Sponsor's income, again there is an  incomplete  picture
    presented.  Essentially  the  Appellant  has  provided  HMRC's  letters
    concerning working and child tax credits  in  respect  of  his  claimed
    income.  However as the letters indicate the amounts given are based on
    estimated  income  provided  by  the  Sponsor  and  therefore  are  not
    necessarily definitive.

22. In the tax year April 2011 to April 2012 the Sponsor claimed an  income
    of �23,467 (page 51 second bundle).  However when the  Sponsor  made  a
    claim for tax credit it is clear he claimed a different level of income
    as noted by HMRC letter (page 68 second bundle).  The Sponsor  in  oral
    evidence claimed in that year he was working for Interplex.

23. The second bundle contains wage slips at pages 1 to 16.  Pages 1  to  3
    are in fact wage  slips  for  the  Sponsor's  adult  son  and  have  no
    relevance in this case.  There is only one wage slip for April 2011  to
    April 2012 at page 8 of the second bundle, that  being  for  June  2011
    showing the Sponsor working at Interplex with a net  weekly  income  of
    �402.35 (gross �524), which would not be inconsistent with an income of
    about �23,467 if he worked throughout that tax year.

24. In the tax year April 2012 to April 2013 the Sponsor claimed he  worked
    at a newsagents.  The tax credit letter discloses his claimed income as
    being �3,460 (page 65 second bundle) and  (a  P60  at  page  15  second
    bundle).  In the tax year 2013  to  2014  the  Sponsor  claimed  to  be
    working at the newsagents and earning �7,205 per annum.  His HMRC  form
    at page 16 second bundle shows that income.

25. In the tax year 2013 to 2014 the Sponsor claimed  to  have  begun  work
    again with Interplex in June 2014.  There are pay statements at pages 4
    to 6 and 12 of the second bundle showing payslips for July to  November
    2014.  There is further an employee printout at page 14  second  bundle
    showing his details and start date of work as being 2nd June 2014  with
    Interplex.  It also refers to payment of his income by BACS.

26. Bank statements appear at pages 17 to 48 of the second  bundle.   Again
    for unknown reasons the Sponsor's adult son's bank statements have been
    included at pages 17 to  27.   They  have  no  relevance.   Joint  bank
    statements of the Sponsor and Appellant  appear  at  pages  28  to  48.
    However the latest bank statement is dated 30th May 2014.  Further  the
    address given on the bank statements is for 274 Desborough Road,  at  a
    time when the Sponsor was allegedly living at 63  Dashwood  Avenue  and
    with a prior address at 12 Cedar Terrace.  That  same  address  of  274
    Desborough Road appears on the address of the Sponsor's  adult  son  on
    his bank statements.  That same address also appears as  the  Sponsor's
    address on the P60 for April 2013 (page 15 second  bundle)  at  a  time
    when he was meant to be at 12 Cedar Terrace.  The  only  clue  to  this
    inconsistency is a single sheet  bank  statement  dated  November  2011
    (page 32 first  bundle)  showing  that  address.   I  have  on  balance
    therefore inferred that the Appellant and Sponsor lived at that address
    in Desborough Road prior to 12 Cedar Avenue and  their  adult  son  may
    continue to live at that former address and they have simply not, up to
    May 2014, notified the bank of any address changes.

27. None of the bank statements show any earned income paid  in.   Although
    the Interplex income is paid by BACS the bank statements  stop  in  May
    2014 prior to the start of employment there in June 2014.  The  Sponsor
    claims his employment continues.

28. I have considered this case with care given the gaps  in  the  evidence
    submitted and the poor manner in which documentary  evidence  has  been
    put together.  That may not be the Sponsor's  fault.   The  absence  of
    recent bank statements and payslips  is  the  major  concern.   However
    having  observed  the  Sponsor  I   can   understand   if   his   legal
    representatives did not direct him to produce such evidence he may  not
    independently have appreciated the need so to do.

29. His employment at Interplex in the six weeks for  which  payslips  have
    been provided demonstrates a net  income  of  �1,957.   Accordingly  if
    replicated over a full year that produces a net income of over �16,000.
     The Presenting Officer conceded if  the  Sponsor  earned  �13,000  per
    annum then that was sufficient to meet the  requirements  of  paragraph
    287(v).

30. The Sponsor has  indicated  his  employment  continues.   There  is  no
    evidence contrary to that assertion.  There is clear  evidence  of  his
    employment beginning at Interplex in June 2014 and continuing until  at
    least November 2014.  There is a  consistency  in  claims  made  as  to
    approximate incomes in previous years.  It is also the case that he had
    worked at Interplex  previously.   Although  the  presentation  of  the
    Appellants' bundle is poor and missing up-to-date  information  I  have
    concluded that this may not necessarily be the Sponsor's fault.  I have
    also  found  on  balance  just,  that  the  Sponsor's  account  of  his
    employment is credible.

31.  I  find  therefore  on  balance  having  carefully  examined  all  the
    documentary and oral evidence that whilst there are concerns  and  gaps
    as identified above on balance there is just a sufficiency of  evidence
    to show the Appellants can be accommodated and maintained in accordance
    with paragraph 287 of the Immigration Rules and therefore  fulfils  the
    requirement of the sole remaining issue live under paragraph 287.

32. I would further add for the sake of completeness that if the Appellants
    fail to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules this is  a  case
    that would require a second stage examination under Article  8  of  the
    ECHR outside of the Rules.  As I have indicated above, after a  careful
    examination and reasoning of the evidence the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    had concluded that this was a genuine and subsisting marriage in  which
    there are two young children.

33. The Sponsor, I am told and there is no evidence to  the  contrary,  has
    been living in the UK for a not insubstantial period of time and is now
    a British citizen.  If one  was  to  contemplate  the  removal  of  the
    Appellants to Sri Lanka that would contemplate the breakup of a genuine
    marriage and the break in the relationship between the children as  the
    Sponsor who has a  genuine  parental  relationship  with  them.   Under
    ordinary circumstances a central issue therefore would  be  whether  it
    would be reasonable or not to expect the Sponsor himself to relocate to
    Sri Lanka notwithstanding his British citizenship in order to  maintain
    the family bond.

34. The unusual circumstance in this case that requires a consideration  of
    factors outside of the Rules is that the Sponsor  was  granted  refugee
    status in the UK.  That on the face of it means an  acceptance  by  the
    Home Office that if the Sponsor returned to Sri Lanka there would be  a
    real likelihood of persecution or treatment contrary to Article 3.  The
    Respondent has produced no evidence to demonstrate that  the  Sponsor's
    personal circumstances giving rise to his refugee status  have  altered
    and in the absence of any evidence it would be wrong for me  to  assume
    that it would be safe for the Sponsor to return.

35. Accordingly when looking at any proposed removal of the  Appellants  in
    particular the children, the impact upon them of being  separated  from
    their father in circumstances where  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect him to accompany them to Sri Lanka is a not insignificant factor
    when having regard to all  the  statutory  features  that  need  to  be
    considered under Section 117 of the 2002 Act and when  looking  at  all
    features of that section in an assessment of proportionality under  the
    fifth stage test of Razgar as indicated in  the  recent  case  of  Dube
    [2015].  Indeed in the refusal letter of 9th May 2014 whilst  the  Home
    Office have properly had due regard to Section 55 of the Borders Act in
    terms of the question of proportionality their decision appears to have
    been based on the fact that the Sponsor could  himself  return  to  Sri
    Lanka and continue family life there.  As I have indicated above  given
    the Sponsor has been granted refugee status,  in  the  absence  of  any
    contrary evidence I must work on the basis that that course  of  action
    is not necessarily reasonably open to him.

36. In summary therefore if I had  found  this  application  failing  under
    paragraph 287 on the issue of maintenance there are  those  exceptional
    features that would properly have required an  examination  outside  of
    the Rules under Article 8 and having  examined  all  of  the  competing
    features, for the reasons provided above, I would have concluded that a
    removal of the Appellants would have been disproportionate.
