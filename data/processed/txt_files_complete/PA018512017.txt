                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal Sweet (FtJ), promulgated on 29 March 2017, dismissing  the
        Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decision  dated  8
        February 2017 refusing her asylum claim.



   Factual Background


     2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan, date of birth  [  ]  1977.
        She is married to [AG] who is also a national of Pakistan, his date
        of birth being [ ] 1971. The couple have 3 children, born  in  [  ]
        2004, [ ] 2005 and [ ] 2008.


     3. The Appellant's asylum claim is based on a  fear  of  ill-treatment
        from her family, her ex-fianc�, and the local community  where  she
        lived in Pakistan because she married for love. The following is  a
        summary of her asylum claim. She comes from a  conservative  Muslim
        family. She has 3 brothers and 3 sisters. Her brothers, and [A]  in
        particular, believe that  marriages  should  only  occur  within  a
        family's own caste. In 2002 [A] arranged for the Appellant to marry
        [TD], a business partner of her father  and  brother.  Instead,  in
        March 2002, she married [AG] with the help of her sister [S]. Later
        in 2002 her sister informed their brothers that the  Appellant  had
        gone to Dubai with her husband, although she did not. The Appellant
        mainly resided with another of her sisters ([R]) in Pakistan  after
        her husband went to Dubai for work in July 2002. At  some  time  in
        2012 [A] came  to  [R]'s  house,  found  the  Appellant  there  and
        attacked her. The Appellant  was  rendered  unconscious  and  found
        herself in hospital. She then stayed with a friend of  her  husband
        for 2� months before entering the  UK  on  3  December  2012  as  a
        dependent of her husband who was a student (he entered  the  UK  in
        2010). Her leave was valid until 18 August 2014. She overstayed and
        made an asylum claim on 17 August 2016 after finding out  that  [A]
        filed a police report alleging that her marriage  was  illegal  and
        her children illegitimate. The Appellant believes the male  members
        of her family regard her as having dishonoured them and  that  they
        will kill her to restore their honour,  and  that  she  also  faces
        danger from her ex-fianc�, and the local community.


     4. The Respondent did not accept that the  Appellant  entered  a  love
        marriage or that her family reacted in the manner claimed. This was
        based on a number of inconsistencies  and  implausibilities  within
        the Appellant's account, and  because  of  her  delay  in  claiming
        asylum. The Respondent considered that the Appellant could, in  any
        event, avail herself of the internal relocation alternative.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     5. The Appellant provided two bundles  of  documents  for  her  appeal
        which  included  witness  statements  from  her  and  her  husband,
        educational certificates, a psychiatric report dated 12 March  2017
        prepared by Dr Razia Hussain, and an expert country  report,  dated
        14 March 2017, written by Uzma Moeen. The Appellant and her husband
        both gave oral evidence.

     6. The FtJ did not find the  Appellant  gave  a  credible  account  of
        fearing her family. The  Appellant  claimed  her  brother  filed  a
        police report against her but no copy of this report was  provided.
        The FtJ drew an adverse inference from the failure to  provide  the
        police report and the absence of any  explanation  as  to  why  the
        report was filed  so  long  after  the  Appellant's  marriage.  The
        Appellant was unable to explain why it took her brother 10 years to
        locate her at her sister's house. The FtJ rejected the  Appellant's
        claim that her brother believed she was living in  Dubai.  The  FtJ
        found the Appellant was unable to satisfactorily  explain  why  she
        delay her asylum claim and rejected her claim that this was due  to
        her mental state. Having rejected the Appellant's account, the  FtJ
        did not accept the  findings  in  the  expert  country  report.  In
        conclusion, the FtJ dismissed the appeal  on  asylum,  humanitarian
        protection and human rights grounds.

The grounds of appeal and the error of law hearing

     7. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on
        the basis that the FtJ failed to consider explanations provided  by
        her in her interview and her statement as to why her brother lodged
        a police complaint so long after her  marriage,  and  why  he  only
        found out that she was living with one of her sisters in 2012.  The
        grounds further contend that the FtJ erred in law in  his  approach
        to the psychiatric report in finding that the  Appellant's  anxiety
        and depression did not reasonably explain  her  delay  in  claiming
        asylum. Permission was granted by judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
        Lambert on the basis that the grounds were arguable.


     8. Ms Khan expanded upon the grounds in her oral submissions, and drew
        my attention to the relent paragraphs of the Appellant's  statement
        and the expert country report. She submitted that the FtJ failed to
        engage with the explanations provided by the Appellant  in  drawing
        his adverse  inferences.  The  expert  report  indicated  that  the
        imposition of marriages  was  common  in  Pakistan  and  that  some
        families reportedly elicited the help of  the  police  in  tracking
        down partners who marry  without  family  approval,  and  that  the
        estranged families often kill vulnerable love marriage couples even
        after several years of marriage. Mr Bramble invited me to  consider
        the FtJ's findings as a whole,  and  submitted  that  the  FtJ  was
        rationally entitled to draw an adverse inference from the delay  in
        reporting the marriage to the police.

Discussion

     9. I find there is little merit in the submission that the FtJ was not
        entitled to draw an adverse inference against the  Appellant  based
        on her failure to claim asylum in the UK at an  earlier  time.  The
        grounds contend that the judge failed to accord any  or  sufficient
        weight to the medical report which indicated that the Appellant was
        suffering from anxiety and a depressive disorder, and that she  may
        have been reluctant to make an asylum claim because of  her  mental
        state. The medical report however only indicates that, at the  time
        of its creation (12 March 2017) the Appellant  was  suffering  from
        anxiety and a depressive disorder. It does not indicate whether she
        was suffering from any such disorder at the time of and  after  her
        entry to the UK and, in particular, between the expiry of her leave
        in August 2014 and her claim for asylum  2  years  later,  although
        reference is made to the Appellant having a number of  sessions  in
        the Immediate Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT)  in  Brent  in
        2015.  Nor  does  the  medical  report  itself  suggest  that   the
        Appellant's mental state was capable of inhibiting her from  making
        an asylum claim. The judge specifically noted that the  Appellant's
        husband had advised her to claim asylum. It is also clear from  the
        Appellant's interview that she entered the UK as a  result  of  the
        alleged assault by her brother. The grounds contend that the  judge
        failed to consider the Respondent's guidance in respect  of  delays
        in claiming asylum. The judge however  gave  rational  reasons  for
        rejecting this aspect of the Appellant's account and the failure to
        explicitly mention the Respondent's guidance cannot  undermine  the
        sustainability of the judge's conclusions.


    10. I am additionally satisfied that the FtJ was entitled  to  draw  an
        adverse inference from the failure to provide a copy of the  police
        report allegedly lodged by the Appellant's brother. There does  not
        appear to be any reason why the Appellant or her husband could  not
        instruct a lawyer in Pakistan to obtain the police report (which  I
        assume is a First Incident Report (FIR)).


    11. I am however satisfied that the FtJ did err in law  by  failing  to
        engage with the explanations provided by the Appellant  as  to  why
        her brother would only lodge the report some  10  years  after  the
        marriage, and why the brother only located  the  Appellant  at  her
        sister's home in 2012.

    12. In her interview (question 78)  the  Appellant  explains  that  her
        sister, [S], informed her brothers that she (the Appellant) and her
        husband both went to Dubai  after  their  marriage.  In  answer  to
        question 92 of her interview the Appellant again  stated  that  her
        sister informed [A] that she had left Pakistan, and that  [A]  said
        he would have no relationship with anyone who helped the Appellant.
        In her statement (paragraph 43) the Appellant again stated that [S]
        informed [A] that the Appellant had run away to Dubai in  the  hope
        that he would not pursue her in Pakistan, and  that  her  husband's
        family said the same thing (paragraph 46). In her oral evidence  at
        the First-tier Tribunal  hearing  the  Appellant  stated  that  [A]
        thought the Appellant was out of the country. At  paragraph  47  of
        her statement the Appellant explained that [A] stopped  talking  to
        another sister, [R], as a result of a money dispute, and  that  the
        Appellant went to stay with [R] because [A] cut all ties with  her.
        In her oral evidence at the hearing  the  Appellant  again  claimed
        that there was a  money  dispute  between  [R]'s  husband  and  her
        brothers. At paragraph 53 of her  statement  the  Appellant  stated
        that, after finding the Appellant at  [R]'s  house,  he  no  longer
        believed she had left the country and, for this reason,  approached
        the police to help locate her. At paragraph 55 the Appellant  again
        explained that her brother filed a police report because he did not
        accept that she had in fact  left  Pakistan  and,  as  his  sisters
        previously lied to  him,  he  believed  she  may  be  somewhere  in
        Pakistan.


    13. At [37] the FtJ rejects the  Appellant's  claim  that  her  brother
        thought she was living in Dubai. No reasoning however is  given  in
        support of this conclusion. The FtJ rejects the  Appellant's  claim
        that her brothers would not have known  she  was  living  with  her
        sister, but again there is little  reasoning  in  support  of  this
        conclusion, and no reference made to the  explanation  provided  by
        the Appellant, as described in paragraph 12 above. At [33] the  FtJ
        states that the Appellant was unable to explain  why  it  took  her
        brothers 10 years to locate her in a place where  they  would  have
        been familiar, namely her sister's house. It  is  apparent  however
        from  paragraph  12  above  that  the  Appellant  did  provide   an
        explanation.  The  FtJ  failed  to  engage  with  the  explanations
        provided by the Appellant  and  failed  to  give  legally  adequate
        reasons for his conclusions.

    14. I additionally have concerns with the FtJ's treatment of the expert
        country report. The FtJ does not accept the findings of the  report
        because he does not accept the Appellant's account of  the  threats
        made against her. The assessment of the threats allegedly  received
        by the Appellant should however have been considered  in  light  of
        the expert report, which contextualised the Appellant's claim.  The
        expert report confirmed that a woman who marries for  love  without
        the approval of her family could be subject to an  honour  killing,
        that the lodging of a FIR has been used to track people  down,  and
        that those in a love marriage have  been  targeted  even  10  years
        after the marriage. A rejection of the Appellant's  account  before
        consideration of the expert report, which corroborates some aspects
        of her claim, breaches the principles enunciated in Mibanga v  SSHD
        [2005] EWCA Civ 367.


    15. While a judge may be entitled to reject the  explanations  provided
        by the Appellant, (and the issue of internal relocation  is  likely
        to require careful consideration even if  the  Appellant  is  found
        credible), I am not satisfied that the FtJ's  ultimate  conclusions
        would necessarily have been the same had the identified  errors  of
        law not been made. In these circumstances,  it  is  appropriate  to
        remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  completely
        new hearing, all issues open.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision contains a material legal error.
The matter is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal, to be decided  in  a
de novo hearing before a judge other than judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
Sweet.
