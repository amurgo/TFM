For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Lee, Assistant Solicitor with Salam & Co


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant in this appeal  is  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department to whom I shall refer as the claimant.  The respondents  are
    all citizens of India.  They  are  a  mother,  father  and  a  daughter
    respectively aged 31, 38 and  3.   The  first  respondent  entered  the
    United Kingdom on 21st September, 2011 with leave to remain until  15th
    November, 2012.  On 1st November, 2012 she made a combined  application
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    Migrant under the points-based system and  for  a  biometric  residence
    permit.   The  second  and  third  respondents  are  dependent  on  her
    application.

2.     On  23rd  February,  2013  the  claimant  refused  the   respondents'
    applications.  The respondents appealed and their appeal was  heard  in
    Manchester on 9th July last by First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney.   In
    his determination promulgated on 30th July  2013  the  judge  concluded
    that the first named responded had satisfied the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules and he allowed all three appeals.  The  claimant  had
    originally refused the respondents' applications, because in respect of
    the  first  respondent,  the  claimant  found  that  while  the   first
    respondent  qualified  under  attributes,  she  failed  to   meet   the
    maintenance provisions. It was asserted that the first named respondent
    had failed to provide evidence to meet paragraph 1A(h)  of  Appendix  C
    and demonstrate that she was in possession of not less than ï¿½3,400  for
    a consecutive 28 day period.  The judge was satisfied that she had  met
    the requirements by demonstrating this.

3.    The claimant challenged the determination and asserted that the  judge
    was wrong in his determination by allowing the appeal.  They  criticise
    the judge for not making any specific findings on how the documents met
    the terms of the Rules and criticise the judge's findings agreeing with
    the appellants' representations that the relevant funds would have been
    in the relevant account at the relevant time.  They point out that  the
    Secretary of State's evidential flexibility policy does not apply.

4.    At the hearing  before  me  Mr  McVeety  on  behalf  of  the  claimant
    confirmed  that  there  were  no  errors  of   law   in   the   judge's
    determination.  The letters at J1 and K1 ad the statements at L1 and L2
    clearly  demonstrated  that  the  first  named   respondent   met   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules at the date of the  decision.   I
    can find no other obvious error of law in the judge's determination and
    have not been asked to accept an amendment to the grounds of challenge.

5.    In the circumstances I am happy to make this determination  to  record
    the fact that the Secretary of State is content that there is no  error
    of law in the judge's determination which will stand.
