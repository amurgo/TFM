Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Balroop instructed by Universal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Jones, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born  in  1978.   She  appeals
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett, promulgated
    on 18 January 2019, dismissing her appeal against the  refusal  of  her
    protection claim.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Rai on 12
    February 2019 on the ground that the judge arguably  erred  in  law  in
    failing to make an assessment of any threat faced by the  Appellant  in
    consequence of accepting her father was a founding member of  the  BNP.
    Permission was granted on all grounds.

Submissions

3.   Mr Balroop relied on the grounds of appeal dated 1  February  2019.  He
    submitted the judge made the following errors of law:

         (i)  overlooking material evidence;

         (ii) placing reliance on a defective document verification  report;
         and

         (iii)    failing to consider the  possible  future  suppression  of
         political beliefs.

    Ground (i)

4.   Mr Balroop submitted  that  the  judge  failed  to  take  into  account
    relevant evidence of the Appellant's position within the BNP. The judge
    failed to consider the evidence at pages 22 to 25  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle; letters from the Secretary General of the  Bangladesh  National
    Party, the Senior Joint Secretary General of the BNP and the  President
    of the Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Mohila  Dal  Central  Committee  [BJMD],
    Afroza Abbas.

5.   At paragraph 26 of the decision  the  judge  found  the  Appellant  had
    failed to provide evidence from any of the women who held positions  in
    the BJMD. Mr Balroop submitted that the  Appellant  had  provided  such
    evidence, in particular the letter dated 17 October 2018 signed by  the
    President, Afroza Abbas, and  the  General  Secretary,  Sultana  Ahmed,
    stating that the Appellant was  currently  serving  as  Vice-President.
    This was material evidence which the judge failed to take into account.
    The judge made no reference to the letters at pages 22  to  25  in  her
    findings and this amounted to an error of law.

6.   Further the judge accepted that the Appellant's father was  a  founding
    member of the BNP but failed to make an assessment  of  any  consequent
    threat faced by the Appellant as a result. This  point  was  argued  on
    appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  is  evidenced  in   the
    Appellant's witness statement where she states:

         "17. Until then, there were no charges against either my father  or
             me. In the election of 2008 my  father  was  standing  in  the
             Dhaka 3 constituency. I helped his campaign by doing meetings,
             visiting door-to-door. As a result, I became  very  well-known
             and respected in the area, which the local  Awami  League  did
             not like. I  had  significantly  assisted  my  father  in  his
             election campaign as well as making meetings of  my  own  with
             communities in Keraniganj to the south of Dhaka.

         18.  When the election was over and the Awami  league  won,  I  was
             returning home. There was a victory march by the Awami  League
             supporters, and activities and then they attacked me, beat  me
             up causing me to go unconscious.   When  I  awoke,  I  was  in
             hospital, and found my leg was  broken  (please  see  attached
             photograph).   That  was  so  traumatic  that  I   still   get
             nightmares.

         ...

         20.  The fact that I was the daughter  of  a  prominent  opposition
             leader as well as being a member of the Bangladesh Nationalist
             Mohila Dal, the Women's wing of the BNP, this had an  indirect
             negative impact on my career. ...

             In 2010, I was forced to give up my job because I used to face
             a lot of harassment from  colleagues  who  were  Awami  League
             supporters because of  my  political  affiliation.  They  also
             abused me mentally and verbally,  commenting  towards  me,  my
             father and  the  Chairperson  of  the  BNP  and  former  Prime
             Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. ..."

7.   Mr Balroop submitted it was clear from the Appellant's  statement  that
    she relied not only on her position as Vice-President of the BJMD,  the
    women's wing of the BNP, but also because she was  the  daughter  of  a
    prominent leader and founder member of the BNP. Her case  was  advanced
    on both grounds and the judge failed to consider this when  looking  at
    risk on return.

    Ground (ii)

8.   Mr Balroop referred me to the document verification report  at  D56  of
    the Respondent's bundle. The report was in the name of the  Appellant's
    husband. Mr Balroop submitted that the name  and  date  of  birth  were
    incorrect and the report itself was  vague,  concluding  that  the  FIR
    number and the date of the document submitted by the  subject  did  not
    match with the details contained in the register. The judge should  not
    have attached great weight to this document given the error on its face
    and it was not appropriate for the judge to rely on  this  document  in
    order to say that the other documents were unreliable. The judge failed
    to give any other explanation for why  he  found  the  other  documents
    unreliable. The document verification report contained an error and was
    too vague to be sufficient to render all other documents unreliable.

    Ground (iii)

9.   It was accepted that a political supporter of the BNP faced a risk  and
    that was apparent from the Home Office CIG. Therefore, the judge  erred
    in law in failing to make an assessment as  to  whether  the  Appellant
    might be at risk on return to Bangladesh based on her participation  in
    government criticism here in the UK  and  given  the  position  of  her
    father.

10.  In YV (Eritrea) [2008] EWCA Civ 360 at paragraph 18 it  stated:  "Where
    the Tribunal has objective evidence which paints a bleak picture of the
    suppression of political opponents by a named  government  it  requires
    little or no evidence or speculation to arrive at a strong  possibility
    - and perhaps more - that its foreign legations not  only  to  film  or
    photograph their nationals who demonstrate in public against the regime
    but have informers among expatriate oppositionist organisations who can
    name the people who are filmed or photographed."

11.  Ms Jones submitted that ground (i) was not material given the delay  in
    claiming asylum. The judge was aware of  the  errors  in  the  document
    verification report and took that into account  at  paragraph  33.  The
    judge's  conclusion  that  the  Appellant  failed  to  give  sufficient
    evidence about the break in at her house was open to her  and  did  not
    amount to an error of law. Ms Jones accepted that there was some  merit
    in the argument that the judge failed  to  refer  to  page  25  of  the
    Appellant's bundle  and  made  findings  which  were  contrary  to  the
    evidence.

The judge's findings

12.  The judge made the following findings relevant to  this  appeal  (words
    in italics are my emphasis):

         "24. The Respondent at paragraph 47 does  not  accept  she  is  the
             president as external information showed that  Zeba  Khan  was
             the vice-president.  In  response  the  appellant  produced  a
             number of articles from page 52 of the bundle which  described
             rallies in the UK in 2018  following  the  trial  of  the  BNP
             acting chairman. There were no articles from any newspaper  or
             tv channel in Bangladesh showing her to be the  vice  chairman
             or a vice chairman [sic] of the party. There  are  photographs
             of the appellant and her family in the UK with BNP members and
             at BNP rallies but they postdate  the  decision  by  some  two
             years."

         ...

         26.  At page G192 of the Respondent's bundle there  is  an  article
             apparently published on-line by the BNP on 27  September  2016
             which says that Afroza Abbas was the president of the  women's
             party and Nurjahan Yasmin was the senior vice president.  Zeba
             Khan was named as the vice-president and Helen Zerin Khan  was
             made joint general secretary. There was no reference to  there
             being more than one vice-president. The appellant provided  no
             evidence from any of these women in  her  appeal  and  is  not
             mentioned in the article.  She did  produces  [sic]  a  letter
             from Sherin Sultana dated 3rd June 2016 who she  says  is  the
             general secretary of the women's party. I attach little weight
             to that document as although it predates the September report,
             that report did not suggest the party had a general  secretary
             post.  In addition, the letter says the appellant had to  flee
             Bangladesh to escape danger to her life whereas the  appellant
             says she came to study and does not suggest she was in  danger
             at the time she left.

         ...

         33.  I accept that the DVR contains an error in the names  that  it
             bears but it is clear form the report itself that the  officer
             checked the FIR number provided  by  the  appellant  with  the
             register and found it to be inconsistent. I  am  satisfied  on
             balance the DVR showed that the FIR numbered  37  produced  by
             the appellant was not a genuine one.

         34.  Plainly that gives rise to doubts as to the  validity  of  the
             other documents produced by the Appellant and whilst I do  not
             find them to be false I attach little  weight  to  them  given
             that one of their number is not genuine.   ...The  appellant's
             own expert indicated that it was not difficult to obtain false
             documents in his report.

         35.  I  accept  that  the  appellant's  father  has  a  significant
             position with the BNP being a founder member and that  he  has
             been imprisoned and attacked as  a  result  of  his  position.
             There is good evidence to show that is the case.

         36.  I accept that the appellant may have  attended  a  rally  some
             years ago in support of the party  where  violence  ensued  as
             there is evidence of a rally being broken up. I do not  accept
             that the appellant is the vice president of the BNP's  women's
             section as there is nothing from  the  BNP  in  Bangladesh  to
             confirm that to be the position. The appellant did  not  refer
             to herself as vice president until after she had been  in  the
             UK for some three years. She has produced no evidence from the
             woman named as the vice chairman, Zeba Khan,  to  clarify  the
             position and has not explained why she has not contacted those
             currently leading her party to support her. I accept that  she
             may have attended meetings of the female wing of the party  in
             the past but I am not satisfied that she  was  active  on  the
             party's behalf or that she had a formal role within the  party
             for the reasons given above.

         37.  Looking at  the  appellant's  claim  in  the  round,  she  has
             produced one false document and others which are not reliable.
             She has produced no evidence to show she holds a position with
             the BNP save for the witness statements from  two  friends  in
             the UK. Neither says how they  know  she  is  vice  president.
             There is no evidence from the female  wing  of  the  party  to
             support her. I accept she may have attended meetings in the UK
             as there are photographs of her but they  appear  to  postdate
             the decision."

Discussion and Conclusions

13.  It is apparent from the judge's findings at paragraphs 26,  36  and  37
    that she failed to take into account the documents at pages 22 to 25 of
    the Appellant's bundle. There was clear evidence from the President  of
    the BJMD, Afroza Abbas, and the judge  made  an  express  finding  that
    there was no such evidence from her. The judge failed to deal with  the
    content of  these  letters.  Any  finding  that  these  documents  were
    unreliable on the basis of one fraudulent FIR was insufficient.

14.  At 36 the judge stated that the Appellant had  not  explained  why  she
    had not contacted those currently leading her  party  to  support  her.
    This finding was not open to the  judge  given  the  letters  from  the
    Bangladesh  Nationalist  Party  and  from  the  President  and  General
    Secretary of the BJMD. Whilst it is correct there is no  evidence  from
    the Vice Chairman, there was evidence from the President accompanied by
    proof of postage from Bangladesh. It was incumbent on the judge to deal
    with this evidence and explain the weight she attached to it.

15.  The judge also erred in law in failing to consider risk  on  return  on
    the basis that, having accepted that the  Appellant  attended  meetings
    and rallies, she would  not  be  risk  as  a  result  of  her  father's
    prominent position within the BNP.

16.  I find that the judge erred in law in  failing  to  take  into  account
    material evidence and in failing to consider the risk on  return  as  a
    result of the Appellant's father's significant position with the BNP. I
    set aside the decision. None of the judge's findings are preserved.

17.  I have decided  in  accordance  with  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Practice
    Statements of 25 September 2012 that the decision dated 18 January 2019
    should be set aside and the appeal remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.
    The Tribunal is directed pursuant to section 12(3)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 to reconsider the appeal at  a  hearing
    before a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Grimmett.
