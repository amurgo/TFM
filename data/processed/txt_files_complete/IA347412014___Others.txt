                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are appeals  by  Dr  Nor  Asikin  Tegoh,  her  husband  and  four
    children.  They are citizens of  Malaysia  born  4th  June  1966,  16th
    December 1961, 30th August 1992, 9th November 1993,  17th  August  1996
    and 18th May 1998.  Only one child, the sixth Appellant,  is  a  minor.
    They appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Lloyd-Smith issued on 20th January 2015 allowing  the  appeals  of  the
    Appellants against the decision of the Respondent made on  14th  August
    2014 to refuse further leave to remain  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Judge Lloyd-Smith allowed the appeals  of  the  two  youngest  children
    under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and the others on human
    rights grounds.

 2. The Respondent appealed against that decision and  on  4th  March  2015
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Baker granted permission  to  appeal.   Judge
    Baker said:

         "2.  The first Appellant and her husband had  been  stated  by  the
             Respondent not to be able to satisfy  the  parent  or  partner
             criteria and had not been in the country  for  a  long  enough
             period.  Najihan, the sixth Appellant, was said to have  lived
             in the United Kingdom for more than half her life but  it  was
             reasonable to expect her to return  to  Malaysia  because  she
             would be doing so with her family.  The other  three  children
             were said not to satisfy paragraph 276ADE because they had not
             lived in the United Kingdom long  enough  and  there  were  no
             significant obstacles to them  returning  and  integrating  in
             Malay society.

         3.   There is merit in the  grounds  that  there  was  an  arguable
             misdirection in law in the decision.  It is arguable  that  in
             not specifically considering Section 117A -  B  in  performing
             the  proportionality   assessment   under   the   Nationality,
             Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  there  was   a   material
             misdirection in law.  The Judge apparently allowed the appeals
             on Article 8 grounds outside the Immigration Rules."

 3. It is submitted in the grounds that the Judge had  failed  to  consider
    and apply Sections 117A to 117B of the 2002 Act which are mandatory.

 4. Judge Lloyd-Smith noted that all the Appellants had spent nine years in
    the UK and that this meant  that  the  two  youngest  Appellants  would
    qualify for leave under 276ADE.  The Judge properly considered case law
    relative to the best interests of the children and  took  into  account
    the statements that the children themselves had made.   She  took  into
    account that they were at a crucial stage of their education.

 5. It is the case that Judge Lloyd-Smith did not mention  Section  117  of
    the 2002 Act.  It is not referred to at all.  She did  however  clearly
    find that it would be unreasonable to expect the two  younger  children
    to leave the UK at what is a  crucial  stage  in  their  education  and
    taking account of the fact that they have been  here  for  nine  years.
    She took into account that the first Appellant had always respected and
    abided by the Immigration Rules and  that  the  family  can  all  speak
    English.  Indeed there is nothing in the circumstances of  any  of  the
    six Appellants which would have increased the public interest in  their
    removal having considered the factors set out in s. 117 A-B of the 2002
    Act.  Judge Lloyd-Smith gave sound reasons for her decision  which  was
    open to her on the evidence before her for the reasons given.  Although
    she may well have erred in law in failing to specifically refer  to  s.
    117B she clearly did take account of the  relevant  factors  and    her
    omission was not in my view material.

Decision

I find that there is no material error of law in the decision of First  Tier
Tribunal Judge Lloyd-Smith and I uphold that decision. .

No anonymity direction is made.
