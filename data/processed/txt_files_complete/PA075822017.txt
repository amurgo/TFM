                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms V Easty, instructed by Sriharans Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Alex Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on  [  ]  1980  and
    who applied for asylum, having spent some time in the United Kingdom as
    a student.  His application for recognition as a refugee was refused by
    the respondent on 26th July 2017 and  he  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

2.   His appeal was heard at  Hatton  Cross  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Chana on 7th September  2016.   She  found  the  appellant  not  to  be
    credible and dismissed his asylum claim,  his  humanitarian  protection
    claim and his appeal based on his human rights.

3.   Before me today it has been accepted by both representatives  appearing
    before me that the  determination  of  Judge  Chana  contains  material
    errors of law, not least of which  is  her  failure  to  make  properly
    reasoned findings.  I set aside her determination.  The appeal will  be
    heard afresh by a judge other than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana.
    None of the findings made by the judge survive.
