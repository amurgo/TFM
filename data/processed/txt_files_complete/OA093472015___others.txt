Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr H Ndubuisi, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Farrelly, promulgated on 12 October 2016, on three grounds.

 2. The first ground is directed against the  failure  of  the  case  under
    �320(11) and SEC 1.6 of appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    argument is that the immigration breaches took place over 10 years ago;
    those provisions are discretionary  rather  than  mandatory;  mandatory
    exclusion  is  for  a  maximum  of  10  years;  the  second  and  third
    appellants, being children [the second has become an adult], should not
    suffer for the misconduct of their parents; account should be taken  of
    the Irish citizenship of the third appellant;  the  sponsor  is  now  a
    citizen with businesses in the UK; and the passage of time does make  a
    difference.

 3. There was no reference at the hearing in the UT to  the  terms  of  the
    decisions by the ECO.  The hearing was  conducted  as  if  the  refusal
    under �320(11) applied to all three appellants.  The appellants seem to
    have put their case that way also in the FtT.  However, as far as I can
    detect from the papers, that part of the refusal applies  only  to  the
    first appellant.

 4. Mr Ndubuisi referred to no authority which suggests that once a  period
    of mandatory exclusion has run, discretionary considerations disappear,
    and an applicant must be consider as if  the  record  was  unblemished.
    The passage of time may be relevant, but  discretionary  considerations
    are not time-limited.  The comparison is not a good one.

 5. The rest of ground  one  is  only  insistence  that  factors  were  not
    considered when they were, and disagreement with  an  assessment  which
    was open to the judge.  It was said that the judge failed  to  identify
    aggravating circumstances as required by PS [2010]  UKUT  440,  but  he
    did; see � 11, 17, 18.

 6.  Mr  Ndubuisi  acknowledged  that  to  succeed  under  the  rules,  the
    appellants had to make out both grounds one and two.

 7. The second ground is that  the  judge  gave  no  adequate  reasons  for
    concluding that the financial requirements of the rules were  not  met,
    because he did not deal with "a whole bundle  of  supporting  financial
    documents" produced to the FtT.

 8. This ground fails at the first hurdle. Mr Ndubuisi  accepted  that  the
    rules required the evidence specified in appendix FM-SE to be  produced
    with the applications made to the ECO, and that he had no authority  on
    which to argue that appeals might succeed under the rules by production
    of evidence which was not with the applications.

 9. The remedy in that respect is by fresh applications to the ECO, not  by
    way of appeal.

10. The third ground is that the  judge  "failed  to  carry  out  a  proper
    article 8 proportionality assessment" and made  no  assessment  of  the
    best interests of the children.

11. Mr Ndubuisi said that the case on the best interests  of  the  children
    was based on the separation of family members, as the sponsor lives  in
    the UK with another child of the  family.   He  acknowledged  that  the
    family has a choice, but he said that  was  forced  upon  them  by  the
    decisions of the SSHD, and the outcome was disproportionate.  The judge
    did not evaluate the impact of the separation upon the children.   Even
    if the evidence of income had not been apt to establish  success  under
    the rules, it should have contributed to the appeal being allowed under
    article 8.

12. This ground is only another disagreement, and shows no error of law.

13. The family situation before the judge was clear.  He left  nothing  out
    of account.  The ground does not disclose that there was anything  else
    of substance which might have been considered.

14. The family  members  have,  as  the  judge  observed,  chosen  to  live
    separately (apart presumably from meeting  in  Pakistan  or  elsewhere,
    although there was no reference to evidence of how family life has been
    carried on).  The decision in this respect was well within the  judge's
    sensible scope. There was no evidence of  any  adverse  impact  of  the
    ECO's decisions on the best interests of the children which might  have
    contributed to to another conclusion.

15. That is enough to dispose of the ground; but it  is  difficult  to  see
    that on the facts before the FtT any judge might  have  found,  by  any
    test, that the appellants have a right to live in the UK, other than in
    compliance with the immigration rules.

16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

17. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
