For the Appellant: Mr Chaudhury, Gramdan Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent: Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



The appellant is a national of Pakistan and was born on 8 August 2007.

This is an appeal by the appellant against the determination promulgated  on
11 December 2013  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ford  which  refused  the
appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 26 February 2013  to
refuse entry clearance as a spouse.

There is no dispute that the substantive  Immigration  Rules  could  not  be
met. The required income of  �18,600  set  out  in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.3  of
Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules had not been shown.

The sole ground of appeal here is that Judge Ford erred in failing to  allow
the appeal under Article 8. It was argued that he did  not  apply  correctly
the ratio of MM v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin). Mr  Chaudhury  argued  that
MM was authority for the appeal being allowed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
where it was accepted at [15] that the sponsor earned �15,096.

Mr Chaudhury's grounds  and  submissions  on  MM  did  not  have  merit.  Mr
Chaudhury argues that the ratio of  MM  is  that  the  income  threshold  in
spouse cases should be  taken  to  be  �13,124  per  year  (not  �18,600  as
required by the Immigration Rules) and the appeal allowed  under  Article  8
if an income of �13,124 is available to support the appellant.

That is not the ratio of MM. As Judge  Ford  stated  correctly  at  [6]  and
[17],  MM  indicated  that  although  the  income  threshold  set   by   the
Immigration  Rules  could  be  found  to  amount   to   a   disproportionate
interference with the family life of a British national  and  a  non-British
national spouse but this would depend on the  circumstances  in  each  case.
The income  threshold  set  by  the  Immigration  Rules  was  expressly  not
quashed; see [121].

Where Judge Ford clearly had the correct test from MM in  mind  when  making
her Article 8 decision, it did not appear to me that she could  be  said  to
have erred when finding at [20]  that  there  was  no  exceptionality  here.
There was nothing other than the failure to meet the income  threshold  that
could be weighed for the appellant. The "combination of  more  than  one  of
... five features of the rules" stated to be onerous as  detailed  at  [123]
and [124] of MM was simply not a feature of this case in which  the  Article
8 claim was, in reality, only a "near miss" argument  and  one  which  could
not succeed; see Patel & Ors v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72.

Mr Chaudhury sought to rely also  on  Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -
correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00460 (IAC). That case is not helpful to  this
appellant. It sets down that the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  are
to be the starting point in the Article 8 assessment and an Article 8  claim
being refused where, as here, there is nothing other than there  being  some
accepted income, but not enough.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not  contain  an  error  on  a
point of law and shall stand.
