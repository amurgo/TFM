For the Appellant:     Miss Pickering of Counsel instructed by Jason
Nicholson Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, HOPO

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Grimshaw
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 4th December 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Turkey and the spouse  of  Rebecca  Mandy
    Tayyare who represented him at the hearing before the First-tier judge.
     She is a British citizen and met the Appellant in Turkey in May  2008.
    They married on 8th June 2010 and have a daughter, Ela,  born  on  19th
    February 2011.  He applied for entry clearance to join her in the UK on
    19th January 2013 but refused because he could not meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 3. It was not argued before the judge that the Rules could  be  met.   The
    Sponsor put her case on the basis that the appeal ought to  be  allowed
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 4. The judge accepted the Sponsor's evidence and  found  that  the  couple
    were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  She also accepted  that
    she had strong commitments to her family in the  UK  and  her  concerns
    about her daughter's health and welfare would make  it  very  difficult
    for both of them to live in  Turkey.   She  recorded  that  they  could
    however visit the Appellant there, and could use modern  technology  to
    keep the family alive during periods of  separation.   Furthermore  the
    Appellant was not prevented from making a fresh application  for  entry
    clearance to the UK in the future if circumstances changed.

 5. She took into account the bests interests of the child  and  said  that
    they required both parents to be living in the UK.  However all  issues
    had to be considered in the round and the best interests of the  child,
    whilst a primary consideration, are not the sole primary consideration.



 6. She wrote as follows

         "When striking a balance as I must between the public interest  and
         the interests of the Appellant my overall conclusion  is  that  the
         interests of the Appellant in allowing him  to  join  Miss  Tayyare
         must give weigh to the greater weight  to  be  apportioned  to  the
         legitimate aim of protecting this country's economic  wellbeing  by
         maintaining proper  immigration  control.   I  bear  in  mind  that
         respect for the right to family life does not  and  cannot  prevent
         the state from establishing conditions which conflict  with  family
         life if such conditions maintain  an  appropriate  balance  between
         private life and the public interest.  Respect for family life does
         not necessarily mean that  members  of  one  family  can  establish
         themselves in the country of their choice."

 7. On that basis she dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 8. The Sponsor drafted her own Grounds of Appeal.   She  said  that  Judge
    Grimshaw had not explained why the  reasons  given  do  not  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles and there were many reasons why it  would  not
    be justified to expect her and her daughter to uproot their  lives  and
    move to Turkey.  Her parents would be devastated.  As a British citizen
    her child has rights which she could not exercise if she was to move to
    another country.  It is not possible  to  make  a  further  application
    because the family situation does not allow them to meet the  financial
    requirements.  The Sponsor is a single mother and not able to  maintain
    a job which would  change  her  circumstances  enough  to  successfully
    sponsor her husband.  She relied on the case of MM and  Others  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWHC 1900. Her husband had taken steps to find work  in  the  UK
    and would not in fact have access to public funds  since  the  visa  he
    would be given prohibits recourse to them.  She felt that she  had  not
    been given a proper hearing because it was very short and  her  parents
    were not called upon to give evidence.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Keane on 8th April 2014.

Submissions

10. Miss Pickering made a number of challenges to this determination.   She
    submitted that the judge had incorrectly directed  herself  as  to  the
    law.  The Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192
    had confirmed that the correct test was  not  insurmountable  obstacles
    but reasonableness.

11. Second she submitted that the judge should have addressed the  case  of
    MM and Others v SSHD [, an extract of which was before  her.   In  this
    case there was evidence that the Appellant had been looking for work at
    a level which would bring him within the lower level of income cited by
    Blake J as being a reasonable level.  Furthermore  there  was  evidence
    that the Sponsor's father would offer third  party  support,  which  is
    excluded by the Rules, but the disregard was cited by Blake J as  being
    potentially disproportionate.

12. Third, the judge did not properly  consider  all  of  the  evidence  in
    relation to the child.  The letter from the nursery recorded  that  Ela
    had found it difficult to settle and the separation from her father was
    having a negative effect on her.   The  evidence  from  the  Children's
    Commissioner, also in the Appellant's bundle, was that  the  separation
    of a child from a parent has particularly serious consequences for very
    young children.

13. She relied on the Supreme Court decision in ZH Tanzania which held that
    the best interests of the child should ordinarily dictate  the  outcome
    of the appeal, and on Chikwamba,  and  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    failed to consider the fact that the Sponsor was a  single  parent  who
    would find it very difficult to meet the Rules and the likely result of
    the decision would be that the couple would be separated for a  lengthy
    period of time.

14. Mrs Pettersen defended the determination.  With respect to MM she  said
    that Blake J was giving guidance to Immigration Judges and  indications
    of his view of what might be disproportionate.  The judge was  entitled
    to take her own view and there was nothing in MM which would dictate an
    outcome in the Appellant's favour.  The judge had clearly had the  best
    interests of the child at the forefront of her mind.



Findings and Conclusions

15. There is no legal error in this determination.

16. First, with respect to MF, it is not authority for the proposition that
    insurmountable obstacles are the  wrong  test.   The  Court  of  Appeal
    specifically  declined  to  make  any  finding  on  the  issue,  simply
    observing that if insurmountable obstacles were  obstacles  which  were
    impossible to surmount, such a stringent  view  would  be  contrary  to
    Article 8.

17. In any event there is no such direction  in  this  determination.   The
    judge in fact said, at paragraph 19

         "If  the  Appellant  cannot  show  that  there  are  insurmountable
         obstacles to establishing a family life with Miss Tayyare  and  Ela
         in Turkey but it would be unreasonable so to do the appeal  may  be
         allowed on human rights grounds."

18. Second, with respect to MM, this is a Sponsor  who  is  in  receipt  of
    state benefits.  She falls a long way  short  of  the  suggested  lower
    minimum income level of �13,400.  The evidence of vacancies to  do  bar
    work would not be a sound basis for concluding that the  Appellant  had
    sufficient earning capacity during the 30 month period of  his  initial
    entry to meet either the lower  level  suggested  by  Blake  J  or  the
    present level of �18,600.  Although there was no reason at all to doubt
    the Sponsor's father's willingness to offer third party  support  there
    was no credible and reliable evidence of support effected by  deed  and
    supported by evidence of ability to fund.

19. Even if the judge had referred to MM in her decision it would not  have
    led her to make a decision in the Appellant's favour, and the  omission
    is immaterial.

20. It is plain that the best interests of Ela were at the forefront of the
    judge's mind.  She was not required to make specific reference  to  the
    document from the nursery school.  The letter, dated some  four  months
    after Ela started at the day care centre, said that  she  had  taken  a
    long time to settle and  had  only  just  begun  to  develop  a  secure
    attachment to her key worker.  The judge accepted  that  Ela's  welfare
    was best served by her remaining in the UK with  her  mother,  but  was
    fully entitled to weigh against that the public interest in maintaining
    proper immigration control, in circumstances where the Appellant cannot
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules.  That was a decision  for
    the judge to make.

21. So far as Chikwamba is concerned, the  facts  are  entirely  different.
    That was a case where the House of  Lords  decided  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable  to  require  a  person  to  return  to  her  country   of
    nationality to make an application for entry clearance which  would  be
    bound to succeed.  In this case, on present circumstances, there is  no
    chance of success.  Allowing the Article 8  appeal  would  be  a  plain
    circumvention of the Immigration Rules

Decision

22. The judge did not err in law.  Her  decision  stands.   The  appeal  is
    dismissed.
