                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The first appellant ("the appellant") appeals against a determination  by
   First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Handley,  promulgated  on  8  November  2013,
   dismissing her appeal against refusal of her application under the Points
   Based System (PBS).

2) The case turns on the application of paragraph 245AA of  the  Immigration
   Rules as it stood at the date of decision, 16 March 2013.   It  does  not
   involve any policy of the respondent about "evidential  flexibility",  or
   any case law on that subject.

3) The application for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  and  the
   grant of permission were on the view that the respondent should  arguably
   have applied Rule 245AA(d)(iii)(1), which says that if an  applicant  has
   submitted a  specified  document  which  does  not  contain  all  of  the
   specified information, but the missing  information  is  verifiable  from
   other documents submitted with the application, then the application  may
   be granted exceptionally.  However, representatives agreed that as at the
   date of decision, that provision was not in the Rules.

4) In her application dated 9 October 2012 the  appellant  sought  leave  to
   remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  Her family members applied as
   her dependants.  As part of her application, she had to  show  access  to
   �200,000.

5) Without waiting  for  the  outcome  of  her  application,  the  appellant
   proceeded to purchase the intended business, a garage in Cowdenbeath.

6) The respondent refused the application by letter dated 16 March 2013.

7) The live point arises from the appellant stating that she had  access  to
   funds being made available by Mr M S Nawaz,  amounting  to  �202,000,  in
   Lloyds TSB Bank.  Rule 41-SD(a)(i) sets out detailed requirements to show
   access to funds made available by a third party contributor.   There  was
   no letter from Lloyds TSB Bank confirming access to these funds,  so  the
   application failed to gain the points required.

8) Mr M S Nawaz is the husband, co-applicant and co-appellant of  Irum  Shah
   Nawaz.

9) With the applications by the appellant and by her  husband  and  children
   as dependants, there was a letter from Lloyds TSB dated 9 October 2012 to
   Mr M S Nawaz relating to a specified account number  with  a  balance  of
   �202,000.  (This is at page D10 of the respondent's bundle in the FtT.)

10) There was produced to the First-tier Tribunal a  copy  letter  from  the
   bank, dated 21 October 2013, to Mr and Mrs M Nawaz  as  account  holders,
   relating to the same account number, balance �8,200.  (This is at page 78
   of the inventory of productions for the appellants in the FtT.)

11) Mr Caskie said that the above showed  that  the  account  was  (at  some
   unknown date) transferred into the joint names of husband and wife.   The
   bulk of the money in the  account  was  in  the  meantime  used  for  the
   purchase.  He submitted that this is a case where the appellant bought  a
   genuine business, and complied with the "substance" of  the  Rules.   Her
   case failed "only on a procedural basis".  There had been  timing  issues
   when preparing the original applications.  It had not been  possible  for
   the  appellant  to  become  a  party  to  the  bank  account  before  the
   applications were submitted.  The funds of �200,000 could be  treated  as
   an asset of the marriage between the  first  and  second  appellants,  to
   which they were both entitled.   The  facts  that  the  garage  had  been
   purchased and that the account was later in their joint names amounted to
   powerful evidence that she did  in  fact  have  access  to  those  funds.
   Although there was a statutory exclusion against the First-tier  Tribunal
   looking at post-decision evidence [2002 Act, section 85A], such  evidence
   became admissible by applying the discretion which the Secretary of State
   has within paragraph 245AA of the Rules.  The concept of a  document  "in
   the wrong format" was not defined in the Rules.  It  should  be  given  a
   broad interpretation, contra proferentem.  If  the  appellants  had  been
   contacted, the required document could have been supplied  within  the  7
   working days permitted.  As the discretion arose within the Rules, it was
   exercisable also by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  the  Upper  Tribunal.
   Discretion should have been  exercised  differently.   If  it  had,  full
   compliance with the Rules could have been shown.   The  decision  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal should be reversed.

12) Mrs O'Brien argued that deficiencies in this application  could  not  be
   treated as a formatting issue.  There was  no  reason  for  the  decision
   maker to think that the document produced was  in  any  way  in  a  wrong
   format.  Even although it now emerged that the funds  were  held  by  the
   appellant's husband and co-applicant, there was  nothing  to  prompt  the
   decision maker to exercise the discretion given by the Rule, so as to  go
   looking for further information.

13) I reserved my determination.

14) Like the judge in the First-tier Tribunal, I  have  some  sympathy  with
   the appellant.  However, as he also said, she must have known that  there
   was a risk in proceeding to purchase a business before having a  decision
   from the  respondent.   Strictly,  she  ought  to  have  known  that  the
   applications were flawed.

15) As I observed at the hearing, there is no reason  for  document  D10  to
   have been included with  the  applications  other  than  to  support  the
   availability of the funds to the appellant.  If Rule 245AA(d)(iii)(1) had
   been in place, I would have seen some force in the proposition  that  the
   missing information was verifiable from the documents submitted with  the
   application.

16) The argument for the appellant turns entirely on  the  proposition  that
   document D10 should have been identified by  the  decision  maker  as  "a
   document  in  the  wrong  format".   On   the   broadest   interpretation
   conceivable, I do not think the wording of the Rule can be stretched that
   far.

17) The document is not in itself deficient in any way.

18) The money not  being  in  her  hands,  the  appellant  needed  a  letter
   complying with Rule 41-SD(a)(i), the requirements of which are  mentioned
   in the respondent's decision  (page  2  of  7)  and  in  Judge  Handley's
   determination (paragraph 8).  As the judge found at paragraph 22, no such
   letter was there.  This is not a formatting  error,  but  an  item  of  a
   different nature.  There was nothing in Rule 245AA as at date of decision
   to prompt a decision maker  to  consider  requesting  further  documents.
   Indeed, it appears that the appellant did not have the necessary document
   to produce, if the request was made.  In order to comply, the  underlying
   financial arrangements had to be changed, not the format of a document.

19) In Alam [2012] EWCA Civ 960 the Court of Appeal said at paragraph 45:

    In these three appeals there  was  no  change  of  position  after  the
    applications were submitted, the appellants were simply at fault in not
    supplying the specified documents with their  applications.  I  endorse
    the view expressed by the Upper Tribunal in Shahzad that  there  is  no
    unfairness in the requirement in the PBS that an applicant must  submit
    with his application all  of  the  evidence  necessary  to  demonstrate
    compliance with the rule under which he seeks  leave.  The  Immigration
    Rules, the Policy Guidance and the prescribed application form all make
    it clear that the prescribed  documents  must  be  submitted  with  the
    application, and if they are not the application will be rejected.  The
    price  of  securing  consistency  and  predictability  is  a  lack   of
    flexibility that may well result  in  "hard"  decisions  in  individual
    cases, but that is not a justification for imposing  an  obligation  on
    the  Secretary  of  State  to  conduct  a  preliminary  check  of   all
    applications to  see  whether  they  are  accompanied  by  all  of  the
    specified documents, to contact applicants where this is not the  case,
    and to give them  an  opportunity  to  supply  the  missing  documents.
    Imposing such an obligation would not only  have  significant  resource
    implications, it would also extend  the  time  taken  by  the  decision
    making process, contrary to the policy underlying the  introduction  of
    the PBS.

20)  Under  the  2002  Act  section  86(3)(b),  the  FtT  and  the  UT  have
   jurisdiction where it is thought that a discretion exercised in making  a
   decision against which the appeal is brought should have  been  exercised
   differently.  Under section 86(6), refusal to depart from  the  Rules  is
   not the exercise of a discretion for that purpose.  It now  emerges  into
   full light that the holder of the funds was the appellant's  husband  and
   co-applicant, with the same apparent interest in  the  outcome.   Whether
   that justifies discretion outside the Rules being exercised in favour  of
   the appellant, notwithstanding the scheme of the PBS, is a matter for the
   respondent only.

21) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal has not been shown  to  err
   in any point of law, and it shall stand.
