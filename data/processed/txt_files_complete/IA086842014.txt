Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Ahmed, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1.   The appellant is a citizen of India born on 13 April  1981.  He  has
      appealed with the permission of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  a
      decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Blum allowing his  appeal
      on article 8 grounds but dismissing it by reference to the Immigration
      Rules. The  appellant  is  the  adult  dependant  of  his  sister,  Ms
      Kanwaljit Kaur, and he lives with her and her family. He is registered
      blind, having no sight in his right eye and very little sight  in  his
      left eye. He also suffers from other medical conditions including back
      pain.


   2.   The respondent had refused the application for leave by reference to
      Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the rules, applying paragraph 400.
      However, the judge  reasoned  the  appropriate  immigration  rule  was
      paragraph 317, HC395, and he found all the elements were met. He  then
      considered the general grounds for refusal found in paragraph  322  of
      the rules. He found the point taken in respect  of  paragraph  322(10)
      was not made out. However, he found  that  paragraph  322(12)  applied
      because the appellant had not paid NHS charges in respect of  all  the
      medical treatment he had received.


   3.   Permission to appeal was granted because it was arguable  the  judge
      erred in failing to recognise that there was no evidence the  NHS  had
      ever asked for payment from the appellant.


   4.   The respondent has not cross-appealed against the  decision  of  the
      judge to allow the appeal on article 8 grounds. It is regrettable that
      it appears the respondent may not have been served  the  determination
      of the First-tier Tribunal in time. Mr Shilliday accepted it  was  the
      case that it was too late to cross-appeal.


   5.   I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.

   6.   I heard submissions from  the  representatives  as  to  whether  the
      judge's  decision   contained   a   material   error   of   law.   The
      representatives  were  in  agreement  that  the  judge  was  wrong  to
      determine the appeal by reference to paragraph 322 grounds, which  had
      not been relied on by the respondent in her decision and  about  which
      the appellant had had no notice. Furthermore, the paragraphs concerned
      provide  for  discretionary  grounds  and  the  respondent  had  never
      exercised  discretion.  In  those  circumstances  the  judge  had   no
      jurisdiction to consider the exercise for himself.


   7.   I agree with the representatives that  the  judge  made  a  material
      error of law for the following reasons.

   8.   Paragraph 322 of the rules reads in relevant part as follows:


         "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave  to  enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused
         ...

         (12) where one or more relevant NHS body has notified the Secretary
         of State that the person seeking leave to remain or a variation  of
         leave to enter or remain has failed to pay a charge or charges with
         a total value of at least �1000 in accordance with the relevant NHS
         regulations on charges to overseas visitors."

   9.    The  judge  appears  to  have  overlooked  the  fact  the  rule  is
      discretionary. As noted, the respondent has not applied  her  mind  to
      the rule or issued a decision which refers to it. In other words,  the
      judge could not  have  decided  that  the  discretion  vested  in  the
      respondent by virtue of the wording of the rule  has  been  exercised.
      Without that having taken place, the  judge  had  no  jurisdiction  to
      review the exercise of discretion or to exercise it himself. The  same
      might be  said  of  the  judge's  application  of  paragraph  322(10),
      although the error was not material to the outcome of the appeal.

  10. I therefore set aside the judge's decision dismissing  the  appeal  by
      reference to paragraph 322 of the  rules.  However,  his  findings  in
      respect of paragraph 317 are  left  undisturbed  by  my  decision  and
      therefore the appropriate disposal of the appeal is  to  allow  it  on
      that basis.

NOTICE OF DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error on a  point
    of law and his determination dismissing the appellant's appeal  is  set
    aside.


    The following decision is substituted: The  appeal  brought  under  the
    Immigration Rules is allowed.


    No anonymity direction has been made.


                               Signed                 Date 5 November 2014

                               Upper Tribunal


    Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007).


    I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note:  Fee  Awards
    in Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


    I make a fee award of �140.


    Reasons:      The appeal has been allowed and  the  respondent  applied
         the wrong rule. .
