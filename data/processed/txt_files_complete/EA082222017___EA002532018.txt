                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Patyna, instructed by Sterling Lawyers
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


           DECISION MADE PURSUANT TO RULES 34, 39 & 40 (3) OF THE
               TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

   1. The appellant appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 25 September 2018.

   2. I am satisfied the Judge misdirected himself in law as  to  who  bears
      the burden of proof and that was compounded by the  reference  to  the
      Appellant not having rebutted the  evidence  of  the  Respondent.  The
      Judge focused on whether the marriage is subsisting and not on whether
      marriage is one of convenience, that is, a sham from the beginning. He
      failed to make any findings as to whether  the  marriage  was  one  of
      convenience from the beginning which was for the SSHD  prove,  despite
      apparently having accepted that it was not when  granting  an  initial
      residence card. For those two reasons alone, the errors were  material
      to the outcome. Given the failure properly  to  evaluate  all  of  the
      evidence, the matter needs to be remitted  to  be  heard  again  by  a
      different Judge.

   3. Rule 40 (1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provided that the Upper Tribunal may  give  a  decision  orally  at  a
      hearing which I did. Rule 40 (3) provides that the Upper Tribunal must
      provide written reasons for its decision with a decision notice unless
      the parties have consented to the Upper Tribunal  not  giving  written
      reasons. I am satisfied that the parties have given  such  consent  at
      the hearing.

      Notice of Decision

   1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and is set aside.

   2. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  hearing  on
      all issues.
