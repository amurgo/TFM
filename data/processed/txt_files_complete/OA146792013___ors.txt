                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against  the  decision  of
    Judge Robson made following a hearing at Bradford on 23rd May 2014.

 2. The background to this case is as follows.  The Sponsor, the husband of
    the fifth Appellant and father of the first four  Appellants,  came  to
    the UK in 2000 from Afghanistan and was  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a refugee on 8th February 2001.  He  lost  contact  with  his
    family for some time but it was resumed in or around 2006.  The Sponsor
    took advice in 2007 and applied for entry  clearance  for  the  family.
    The application was refused and  subsequent  appeal  dismissed  on  the
    basis that the Immigration Judge was not satisfied that the Sponsor had
    proved a relationship with his wife and  children.   DNA  evidence  has
    subsequently shown that they are related as claimed.

 3. The Sponsor became a British national in 2009.   Tragically,  in  2010,
    his eldest son was killed by a bomb blast, and  another  child  wounded
    and he decided that the best course of action was  for  the  family  to
    leave Afghanistan and relocate to Dubai.  He set up  a  business  there
    called the Kandahar General Trading Company Limited and, by  virtue  of
    that business, he was able to successfully apply for a family residence
    permit in Dubai which was granted on 28th September 2010.

 4. The present application for entry clearance was refused on the  grounds
    that he had not provided the specified evidence to show that he  earned
    an income of ï¿½37,397 from his newsagents business.

 5. The judge accepted that in all respects, save for the production of the
    specified evidence, the Immigration  Rules  were  satisfied.   However,
    because there was a missing bank statement in the relevant year he  was
    unable to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 6. He did however allow the appeal on Article 8  grounds.   He  took  into
    account the relevant case law and  accepted  the  submission  that  the
    family's continued existence in  Dubai  was  wholly  dependent  on  the
    residence permits and they could not be guaranteed in the  future.   It
    was significant that the Sponsor had  left  Afghanistan  for  political
    reasons and that the family had suffered the disaster of the eldest son
    being killed by a bomb blast on 26th April 2010, and another son  being
    injured in that incident.  He considered that there were compelling and
    exceptional circumstances in this case which should be considered  when
    applying Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal on the  grounds
    that the judge had failed to give adequate reasons for  findings  on  a
    material matter.

 8. First the Appellants have not lived with the Sponsor since he  fled  in
    2000 and therefore no family life has been conducted in the UK.

 9. Second he could continue to visit the Appellant in Dubai as he has done
    so far and there are no insurmountable obstacles to  him  going  there.
    Article 8 does not of itself guarantee a person's right to live in  the
    UK and the Tribunal has speculated that the permanent residence permits
    would not be  guaranteed  in  Dubai  in  the  future.   The  judge  had
    insufficient regard to the Rules and not followed the  proper  approach
    as set out in Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640  and  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720
    (Admin).

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Lewis for the reasons  stated
    in the grounds.

Submissions

11. Mrs Pettersen relied on her grounds and submitted that  the  judge  had
    erred in speculating as to the family's medium and long-term future  in
    Dubai.  He should have focused on the circumstances as at the  date  of
    decision and at the present time the family have residence  permits  in
    Dubai.

12. Mr Williams submitted that it was open to the  judge  to  consider  the
    precarious nature of the family's residency in Dubai,  that  the  judge
    had properly followed the relevant case law and given adequate  reasons
    for his decision.

Findings and Conclusions

13. The grounds amount to a disagreement with the decision.   Although  the
    Appellants have not lived with the Sponsor since he fled in 2000 family
    life is presumed between husband and wife and  parent  and  child.   It
    does not appear to be in dispute that the Sponsor visits his family  in
    Dubai and on the evidence has arranged his affairs  with  their  safety
    and welfare in mind.

14. The fact that the Sponsor could continue to visit the family  in  Dubai
    was an argument in favour of the Entry Clearance Officer's position but
    not an argument that the judge was bound to accept.

15.  Plainly  the  circumstances  of  this  family  are  capable  of  being
    considered to be exceptional and  compelling.   The  Sponsor  has  been
    recognised as a  refugee.   His  application  for  family  reunion  was
    refused on what turns out to have been a mistaken premise, namely  that
    the family were not related as claimed.

16. The situation of the family in Dubai is uncertain.  They have no  right
    to residence there.  Given that they have  already  lost  a  child  and
    another has been injured, they would understandably be  very  reluctant
    indeed to return to Afghanistan, and  anxious  about  the  prospect  of
    being made to do so in the future.

17. Although Mrs Pettersen submitted that the judge had in practice adopted
    a near-miss approach, that is wrong.   He  did  not  allow  the  appeal
    simply on the basis  that  there  was  a  missing  bank  statement  but
    properly took into account all of  the  relevant  matters,  as  he  was
    required to do, including, unsurprisingly, the distressing  history  of
    this family.

18. The Entry Clearance Officer has not established any error of law in the
    judge's approach.

Decision

19. The judge's decision stands.  The Appellants' appeals are allowed.
