                            DECISION AND REASONS

This has been a remote hearing to which there has  been  no  objection  from
the parties. The form of remote hearing was Skype for business.  A  face  to
face hearing was not held because it was not  practicable,  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing.

The appeal comes before me following the grant of permission  to  appeal  to
the Upper Tribunal.

The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 27 June 1996.  She  applied
for entry clearance to the UK under Appendix FM of the immigration rules  on
the basis of her family  life  with  her  partner  Ismael  Murtaza  Butt,  a
British citizen. The application was refused  on  11  January  2019  on  the
basis  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the   eligibility   financial
requirements of paragraph E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM of the immigration  rules
because the evidence submitted in relation to her sponsor's employment  with
ATR Universal Ltd in the form of payslips and bank statements equated to  an
annual salary of �18,453.32, which  was  below  the  required  threshold  of
�18,600. The respondent considered there to be no exceptional  circumstances
resulting in unjustifiably harsh consequences such as to  breach  Article  8
of the ECHR.

The appellant appealed that decision. In  her  grounds  of  appeal,  it  was
submitted on her behalf that the �73.34 shortfall in earnings was due to  an
accounting error made by the  company's  accountants,  as  the  sponsor  was
contracted to be paid �18,600 a year. It  was  submitted  further  that  the
sponsor and his family could meet the shortfall with financial  support  and
the appellant had also been offered a job in the family business ATR for  an
annual salary of �16,000. Evidence was submitted in the form of  letters  of
support from the  sponsor's  aunt  and  uncle  together  with  payslips  and
savings in a UK savings account of �97,000. The grounds relied upon the  new
paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-SE which permitted the respondent  to  consider
other  sources  of  income  and  funds.  It  was  also  submitted  that  the
respondent failed to  consider  the  appellant's  and  sponsor's  Article  8
rights and that the decision was disproportionate.

The appellant's grounds of appeal were  considered  by  an  Entry  Clearance
Manager, who was satisfied  that  the  decision  was  correct  and  was  not
prepared to exercise  discretion  in  her  favour.  It  was  noted  that  no
specific details had been given about the  'accounting  error'  and  it  was
considered  that  the  immigration  rules  precluded  an  offer  of   future
employment from being taken into account.

The appellant appealed against  that  decision  and,  on  her  request,  her
appeal was determined on the papers by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Harris,
and was dismissed in a decision promulgated on 6 September 2019.  The  judge
agreed with the ECM, that  the  appellant  had  failed  to  demonstrate  the
existence of the claimed accounting  error  and  found  that  the  appellant
could not be assisted by the evidential flexibility provisions  in  Appendix
FM-SE. The judge  considered  that  the  immigration  rules  restricted  the
sources of income to those in paragraph E-ECP.3.2 of Appendix  FM  and  that
they did not include offers of future  employment  or  offers  of  financial
support from third parties. Accordingly, the appellant could  not  meet  the
threshold of  �18,600  pa.  The  judge  considered  that  the  exception  in
GEN.3.1,  with  reference  to  paragraph  21A(2)  of  Appendix   FM-SE   and
acceptable additional sources of income,  was  not  triggered  unless  there
were exceptional circumstances that unlawfully interfered with the right  to
respect for family life under Article 8. He concluded that there  were  none
in  the  appellant's  case  and   that   the   respondent's   decision   was
proportionate. He accordingly dismissed the appeal.

The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
Tribunal and permission was granted on the basis that it was  arguable  that
the judge ought to have considered paragraph 21A of Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
Immigration Rules.

In light of the need to take precautions against  the  spread  of  Covid-19,
the case was reviewed by  an  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  and,  in  a  Note  and
Directions dated 23 March 2020, Vic-President  Ockelton  indicated  that  he
had reached the provisional view that the question  of  whether  the  First-
tier Tribunal's decision involved the making of error of  law  and,  if  so,
whether the decision should be set aside, could be made without  a  hearing.
Submissions were invited from the parties.

Neither party responded to the directions. Upper Tribunal Judge  Finch  then
made further directions on 11 August 2020 and  directed  that  the  case  be
listed for a remote hearing.

The matter then came before me. The sponsor, Mr Butt, appeared on behalf  of
the appellant and confirmed that,  whilst  a  solicitor  was  instructed  to
represent them,  he  was  not  intending  to  attend  the  hearing.  In  the
circumstances I  considered  it  appropriate  for  Mr  Melvin  to  make  his
submissions first.

Mr Melvin submitted that the ECM had considered the grounds  of  appeal  and
found there to  be  insufficient  evidence  that  the  sponsor  was  earning
sufficient for the appellant to  meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
immigration rules and the judge, having assessed the papers before him,  had
reached the same conclusion. The judge considered there to  be  insufficient
evidence in the wage  slips,  a  lack  of  evidence  from  the  claimed  new
accountant, and a lack of adequate evidence from Mrs Mahmood  who  was  said
to be the director of the family business employing the sponsor.  The  judge
may have benefitted from evidence from the sponsor and from  the  accountant
and from further salary slips, but the appellant chose not to have  an  oral
hearing. The judge considered GEN.3.1 of the immigration rules  which  could
link to paragraph 21A(2) if there were exceptional  circumstances  and  made
clear findings that  there  were  no  such  circumstances.  The  judge  made
sustainable findings on the evidence presented and his decision ought to  be
upheld.

Mr Butt, in response, said that his wages were the amount shown as his  boss
could not afford to pay him more. The accountant had made a mistake  in  the
paperwork and they only saw that later. He wanted his wife to  come  to  the
UK as he had been living apart from her for three  years.  He  had  recently
visited her in Pakistan.

Discussion and Findings

The grounds seeking permission repeat the arguments put to the judge  as  to
the unfairness in penalising the appellant  when  there  was  such  a  small
shortfall in the income available from the  sponsor,  of  only  �73.34,  and
when there had been an error made by the company's previous accountant.  The
grounds also reiterate the claim  made  before  the  judge  that  there  was
further support available to the appellant and sponsor  from  the  sponsor's
aunt and uncle, Rosea Mahmood and Tariq Mahmood, as  well  as  an  offer  of
employment for the appellant in the family business ATR Universal  Ltd,  and
assert that the new paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-SE permitted such  evidence
to be considered.

However, and contrary to the reasons given for permission to appeal  to  the
Upper  Tribunal  to  be  granted,  Judge  Harris  had  full  regard  to  the
provisions of paragraph 21A of  Appendix-FM  at  [15]  to  [25].  The  judge
properly noted  that  paragraph  21A  only  applied  when  the  "exceptional
circumstances" requirements of GEN.3.1(1) of Appendix FM were met.  At  [16]
he set out the provisions of GEN.3.1 as follows:

         "GEN.3.1.(1) Where:

             (a) the financial  requirement  in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1.,  E-
             LTRP.3.1. (in the context of an application for limited  leave
             to remain as a partner), E-ECC.2.1.  or  E-LTRC.2.1.  applies,
             and is not met from the specified sources referred to  in  the
             relevant paragraph; and
             (b) it  is  evident  from  the  information  provided  by  the
             applicant that there are exceptional circumstances which could
             render refusal of entry clearance or leave to remain a  breach
             of Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
             because such  refusal  could  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
             consequences for the applicant, their partner  or  a  relevant
             child; then

         the decision-maker must consider whether such financial requirement
         is met through taking into account the sources of income, financial
         support or funds set out in  paragraph  21A(2)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
         (subject to the considerations in sub-paragraphs (3) to (8) of that
         paragraph)."

The judge went  on,  at  [19]  to  [25],  to  consider  whether  there  were
exceptional circumstances which could render refusal of entry  clearance  or
leave to remain a breach of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human
Rights, and provided detailed and cogent reasons for concluding  that  there
were none.

As  such,  the  judge  properly  concluded  that  the  claimed  sources   of
additional income, not being income which fell  within  paragraph  E-ECP.3.2
of Appendix FM, could not be taken into account to  meet  the  shortfall  in
the sponsor's earnings.

At [10] to [13], the judge also considered the appellant's  claim  that  her
husband in fact met the �18,600 threshold and that the evidence in the  form
of his payslips showed a  shortfall  due  to  an  accounting  error  by  the
company's accountants. The judge noted the respondent's concerns  about  the
lack of any evidence from the accountants who were blamed for the  error  or
from the subsequent accountants, and was  fully  and  properly  entitled  to
reject the appellant's explanation for the reasons  properly  given.  As  Mr
Melvin submitted, the appellant had chosen not to have an  oral  hearing  at
which the sponsor could present oral evidence and at  which  other  evidence
could be produced. The judge was only able to make a decision on the  papers
and evidence before him and it is plain from his careful assessment  of  the
evidence that it was significantly lacking and failed adequately to  support
the claims made.

The submissions made by the  sponsor  at  the  hearing  before  me  did  not
address the relevant  issues.  His  submissions,  as  with  the  grounds  of
appeal, were little more than a disagreement with the respondent's  and  the
judge's decision. The judge undertook a full and detailed assessment of  the
evidence in the context of the relevant immigration rules and was fully  and
properly entitled  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
requirements of the rules and that there were  no  compelling  circumstances
justifying a grant of entry clearance outside the immigration rules. As  the
judge properly observed at [24], the respondent's decision did  not  prevent
the appellant and sponsor from ever pursuing a family life together  in  the
UK, but the appellant could simply re-apply for  entry  clearance  once  the
sponsor was able properly to demonstrate  the  required  income.  The  judge
properly concluded that the respondent's decision was  not  disproportionate
and was not in breach of Article 8.

For all of these reasons I find no error of law in the judge's decision  and
I uphold the decision.


DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision.  The  decision  to
dismiss the appeal stands.
