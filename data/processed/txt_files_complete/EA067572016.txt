                       ______________________________

                             DECISION & REASONS
                        _____________________________

    1.     The Appellant is a national of Ghana, born on  14.11.73.  On  22
    November 2010 she was issued with  a  residence  card  valid  until  22
    November 2015. On 1 December 2015, she applied for permanent  residence
    on the basis of a retained right of  residence.  This  application  was
    refused on 19 May 2016, on the basis that the Appellant had  failed  to
    provide a divorce certificate  (albeit  she  had  submitted  a  divorce
    petition issued on 13 October 2015). The respondent accepted that there
    were P60's and payslips covering the period 2009  through  to  2015  in
    respect of the Appellant's former spouse and thus  there  was  evidence
    that the EEA spouse national had been exercising treaty rights.

    2.     The Appellant appealed against this decision  stating  that  her
    decree absolute was due to be issued the  following  week.  Her  appeal
    came before Judge of the First tier Tribunal Broe  for  hearing  on  20
    July 2017 for consideration on the papers. The Appellant had  submitted
    a bundle of documents, including her decree absolute issued on  6  June
    2016 and evidence of her and her former's husband's employment.

    3.     In a decision and reasons promulgated  on  2  August  2017,  the
    Judge dismissed the appeal, on the  basis  that  at  the  time  of  the
    application and decision the Appellant was still married and thus  "her
    divorce is a matter arising after the date of  the  decision"  and  was
    thus not relevant because "at the time it  was  a  fact  that  she  was
    married and not therefore entitled to a retained right  of  residence."
    [12]. The Judge directed himself at [10] in respect of section 85(4) of
    the NIAA 2002, as amended, that the Tribunal may  consider  any  matter
    which it thinks relevant to the substance of the decision  including  a
    matter arising after the date of decision although not a new matter for
    the purposes of subsection (6) without permission from the Secretary of
    State.

    4.     An application for permission to appeal was made  on  the  basis
    that the Judge failed to consider the evidence that was  placed  before
    him, most importantly the Appellant's divorce certificate; at the  time
    of the application the Appellant and her ex  husband  had  been  living
    separate and independent lives and were not married and  the  Appellant
    is entitled to retain her right of residence.

    5.     In a decision dated 18 January 2018, permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Designated Judge McClure on the basis that in light  of  the
    case of Mahmud (s.85 NIAA 2002 - new  matters)  Iran  [2017]  UKUT  488
    (IAC) specifically at [31] it was arguable that the judge's approach to
    section 85 is not correct.

    Findings

    6.     I set out the headnote in Mahmud  (op  cit)  which  provides  as
    follows:

         "1.      Whether something is or is not a 'new matter' goes to  the
         jurisdiction of the First-tier Tribunal in the appeal and the First-
         tier Tribunal must therefore determine for itself the issue.

         2. A 'new matter' is a matter which constitutes a ground of  appeal
         of a kind listed in section 84, as required by section 85(6)(a)  of
         the 2002 Act. Constituting a ground of appeal means  that  it  must
         contain a matter which could raise or establish a listed ground  of
         appeal. A matter is the factual substance of a claim. A  ground  of
         appeal is the legal basis on which the facts in  any  given  matter
         could form the basis of a challenge to the decision under appeal.

         3. In practice, a new matter is a  factual  matrix  which  has  not
         previously been considered by the Secretary of State in the context
         of the decision in  section  82(1)  or  a  statement  made  by  the
         appellant under  section  120.  This  requires  the  matter  to  be
         factually distinct from that previously raised by an appellant,  as
         opposed to further or better evidence of an  existing  matter.  The
         assessment will always be fact sensitive."

    The Upper Tribunal further held as follows at [46]:

         "46.     The issue of whether a  'matter'  is  a  'new  matter'  is
         inevitably a fact sensitive one to be assessed in each appeal,  but
         should  be  identifiable  by  something  being   raised   that   is
         distinguishable from and outside of the  context  of  the  original
         claim and decision in response to it, as well  as  something  which
         constitutes a ground of appeal in section 84 of the 2002 Act."

    On the facts in that case, the Upper Tribunal found that the fact  that
    the Appellant had a new partner, who was not mentioned until the notice
    of appeal, did constitute a new matter.

    7.     In this case, however, the Secretary of State was clearly put on
    notice  in  the  application  for  permanent  residence  that  it   was
    predicated  upon  retention  of  residence  rights  in  light  of   the
    Appellant's  impending  divorce,  the  divorce  petition  having   been
    submitted along with the application. In these  circumstances,  I  find
    that the fact that the divorce had subsequently  taken  place  and  was
    evidenced by a copy of the decree absolute served  on  the  First  tier
    Tribunal, which was before the Judge at the date of  his  consideration
    of the appeal, did not constitute a new matter. The fact of the divorce
    was not factually distinct but rather "further or better evidence of an
    existing matter." It follows that the Judge erred materially in law  in
    treating the fact of the  Appellant's  divorce,  as  evidenced  by  the
    decree absolute, as a new matter.

    8.     I informed the parties at  the  outset  of  the  hearing  of  my
    preliminary view, based on the decision in Mahmud and invited  them  to
    make submissions if they so wished, however, they were content for  the
    appeal to be determined on the basis I indicated to them.

    Decision

    9.     I find a material error of law in the  decision  of  First  tier
    Tribunal Judge Broe. I substitute a decision allowing the appeal on the
    basis that the Appellant meets the requirements of regulation 10(5)  of
    the  Immigration  EEA  Regulations  2006   and   thus   satisfies   the
    requirements of regulation 15(1)(f) of the Immigration EEA  Regulations
    2006.
