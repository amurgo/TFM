For the Respondent:    Mr B Malik instructed by UK Migration Lawyers Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I
    will refer to the  parties  as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who  was  born  on  27  November
    1981.  He first entered the United Kingdom on 21  September  2006  with
    entry clearance as a student and leave valid  until  31  October  2009.
    Thereafter, his leave was extended on a number of occasions as a Tier 1
    (Post Study) Student  and  as  a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  until  5
    September 2016.

 3. On 2 September 2016, the appellant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain (ILR) relying on para 276B of the Immigration Rules (HC  395  as
    amended) on the grounds of ten years continuous lawful residence in the
    UK.

 4. On 5 February 2018, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    claim under para 276B and also under Art 8 ECHR on  the  basis  of  his
    private and family life under Appendix FM and outside the Rules.

 5. The sole basis for the Secretary of State's decision in respect of para
    276B was that the 'general ground' of refusal in  para  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules applied, namely that it was undesirable to permit him
    to continue to remain the UK in the light of his conduct.  The basis of
    that decision was that there  were  discrepancies  in  the  appellant's
    claimed income for the tax years 2010/11 and 2012/13 relied upon in his
    earlier applications for leave and in his disclosed income to the  HMRC
    for those tax years.

 6. In relation to his early applications  for  leave,  the  Appellant  had
    claimed to have a self-employed income for the tax  year  2010/2011  of
    �37,032 whilst his self-employed income submitted to HMRC for that year
    was �5,715 - a discrepancy of over �31,000.  In  relation  to  the  tax
    year  2012/2013,  the  self-employed  income  claimed  in  his  earlier
    application for leave was �39,171.  The figure disclosed  to  the  HMRC
    for the purposes of his tax liability in that year  was  �8,742.   That
    was a discrepancy of over �30,000.

 7. The appellant had in 2016 sought to rectify the discrepancies with  the
    HMRC and on 26 May 2016 a further assessment was made for the tax  year
    2012/2013 requesting him to pay  tax  of  �8,123.19.   Further,  on  17
    August 2016,  and  in  respect  of  his  tax  liability  for  the  year
    2010/2011, a further assessment asking him to pay �9,147.97 was  issued
    by the HMRC.

 8.  The  Secretary  of  State  was  satisfied  that  the   appellant   had
    misrepresented  his  earnings  and  concluded  that  the  discretionary
    'general ground' of refusal under para 322(5) applied.   That  was  the
    sole basis upon which leave was refused under para 276B on the basis of
    the appellant's ten years continuous lawful residence in the UK.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appellant
    submitted a bundle of documents including a detailed witness  statement
    at pages D1-10 of the bundle.  The appellant also  gave  oral  evidence
    and was cross-examined by a Presenting Officer.   The  essence  of  the
    appellant's case was that he had not been dishonest.  He  had  had  two
    sources of  income,  namely  from  his  business  services  and  travel
    services.  The income from the former exceeded the latter.  He  claimed
    that he had employed two separate firms of accountants to deal with his
    two sets of business affairs.  He did so on the basis that he  believed
    that two separate tax returns had to be submitted.   His  evidence  was
    that both accountants used the "same Login details for the HMRC portal"
    which allowed for the provisional details of his self-assessment.   The
    firm of accountants dealing with his business services (J Stanley Riz &
    Company) provided details of his business services income on the online
    portal.  However, the firm  of  accountants  dealing  with  his  travel
    services (Mahmood Accountancy)  changed  the  figures  to  reflect  the
    income derived from his travel services.  As a result, only the  income
    from his travel services was declared to the HMRC.  He said that it was
    the income from  his  business  services  which  was  declared  to  the
    Secretary of State and hence the discrepancy.

10. The appellant's case was that he was unaware of the  discrepancy  until
    in late 2015, in the course of child proceedings concerned with his now
    former partner, it was pointed out by her  that  he  had  declared  the
    incorrect income.  There had been a delay in  doing  so  but  that  had
    occurred in 2016.

11. Before the judge, the appellant's evidence was that he had attempted to
    obtain supporting documents from his accountants, but  the  firm  of  J
    Stanley Riz & Company (who dealt with his business services income) had
    closed down and Mahmood Accountancy (who  had  dealt  with  his  travel
    services income) had refused to assist him.  He said that he  had  sent
    texts to the office but had had "no success".

12. He claimed before the judge that he  was  not  (as  required  for  para
    322(5) to apply) dishonest: the discrepancy was simply a mistake  which
    he had corrected.

13. Judge Young-Harry gave her reasons for concluding that  the  respondent
    had not established that para 322(5) applied, in  particular  that  the
    appellant had been dishonest, at paras 16-22 as follows:

         "16. The appellant claimed, as part of his  November  2011  Tier  1
             extension application, that he earned �37,032 for  the  period
             2010-2011.  The respondent does not  challenge  this,  neither
             does he suggest that this figure is  incorrect.   However  the
             appellant declared a substantially lower figure  in  his  HMRC
             tax return for the same period.

         17.  As part of his April 2013 Tier 1  application,  the  appellant
             declared an income of �39,171 however he again declared a much
             lower figure on his  tax  return.   The  respondent  does  not
             dispute the income as  declared  in  the  April  2013  Tier  1
             application.

         18.  The appellant claims he did not notice the  discrepancy  until
             his wife pointed it out recently.  He immediately  took  steps
             to remedy the issue with HMRC.

         19.  The appellant claims the problem  arose  because  he  has  two
             income streams, one from business services and the other  from
             travel services.  The appellant for  some  reason  thought  it
             would be expedient to have two separate  accountants,  who  in
             turn thought it would be a good idea to  submit  two  separate
             tax returns for the same  year.   This  understandably  caused
             great confusion and is the reason for the discrepancy.

         20.  The appellant made an unprompted declaration to  HMRC,  asking
             them to rectify the figures.   The  fact  it  was  unprompted,
             meant the appellant avoided a penalty and  no  further  action
             was taken.  I find this is to the appellant's credit.  I  note
             by notifying HMRC, the appellant would be required to pay more
             tax; despite this he still made the decision to notified them.

         21.  I found the appellant's  explanation  credible  and  reliable.
             Although, given the nature of  his  business  one  would  have
             expected a higher degree of vigilance, however I accept it was
             a  mistake  and  it  was  not  directly  attributable  to  the
             appellant.

         22.  I do not find the  respondent's  case  is  made  out  in  this
             regard.  I do not find paragraph  322(5)  has  been  correctly
             applied ...."

14. The judge went on to find that the remaining requirements of para  276B
    were met - indeed the contrary was not, it seems, argued before  her  -
    and in the light of that allowed the appellant's appeal under Art 8  of
    the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

15. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal essentially on two grounds.  First, the judge in reaching  her
    finding that the appellant had not been dishonest had failed  to  apply
    the approach set out in the Upper Tribunal's decision  in  R  (Khan)  v
    SSHD (dishonesty, tax  return,  paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  00384
    (IAC), in particular in considering all the relevant  evidence  as  set
    out in para (v) of the headnote.  Secondly, the judge had been wrong to
    take into account  (at  para  20),  that  the  appellant  had  made  an
    "unprompted declaration to the HMRC"  in  2016  rectifying  the  under-
    disclosed income and, therefore, liability to tax in the years  2010/11
    and 2013/14.

16. On 28 January 2019, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge N Haria) granted the
    Secretary of State  permission  to  appeal.   On  14  April  2019,  the
    appellant filed a rule  24  response  seeking  to  uphold  the  judge's
    decision.

Discussion

17. The relevant provision in para 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules,  which
    is central to this appeal, sets out a 'general ground' of refusal on  a
    discretionary basis in the following terms:

         "The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in
         the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct   (including
         convictions which do not fall within para  322(1C)),  character  or
         associations or the fact that he represents a  threat  to  national
         security."

18. The  proper  interpretation  and  application  of  that  provision  has
    recently been examined by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the  case  of  R
    (Balajigari and Others)  v  SSHD  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673.   That  case,
    concerned  with  a  number  of  judicial  review  decisions  challenges
    refusals of leave  based  upon  para  322(5),  recognises  a  two-stage
    approach:

          i) an assessment of whether  the  individual's  conduct  makes  a
             grant of leave "undesirable"; and

         ii) if it is, whether discretion should  be  exercised  to  refuse
             leave.

19. The analysis in relation to the  first  issue  is  at  [33]-[38]and  in
    relation to the second issue is at [39]-[44].




20. As regards the issue of "undesirability", the Court of Appeal  accepted
    the submissions made on behalf of the individuals  in  that  case  that
    there were three limbs relevant to determining that issue.   The  court
    said this at [34]:

         "There  must  be:  (i)  reliable  evidence  of;  (ii)  sufficiently
         reprehensible conduct;  and  (iii)  an  assessment,  taking  proper
         account of all relevant circumstances known about the applicant  at
         the date of decision, of whether his or his presence in the  UK  is
         undesirable (this should include evidence of positive  features  of
         their conduct)."

21. It was common ground between the representatives  before  me  that  the
    Court of Appeal's decision in Balajigari did not materially affect  the
    issues that I had to decide.  That was  because  the  judge's  decision
    turns upon whether the appellant had been shown to be  dishonest.   The
    Court of Appeal had accepted that dishonesty  was  a  "touch-stone"  of
    establishing this ground  (see  [36]).  Consequently,  if  the  judge's
    decision was legally sound, the appellant succeeded.   However,  if  it
    was not legally sound and the decision was set aside, then any remaking
    of the decision would  have  to  take  into  account  the  approach  in
    Balajigari in reaching a fresh  decision  as  to  whether  para  322(5)
    applied.

22. Consequently, the submissions before me focused on  whether  the  judge
    had erred in law by failing to apply the approach set out in  the  UT's
    decision in Khan.  Before I turn to that decision, Khan was  considered
    by the Court of Appeal in Balajigari (see especially  [40]-[44]).   The
    UT's decision was, in general, approved by the Court of Appeal with the
    caveat that at [32] the UT in Khan had  mis-stated  -  by  putting  the
    matter too high - when concluding  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    entitled as a "starting point" to infer that  an  individual  had  been
    deceitful or dishonest  when  a  significant  difference  in  disclosed
    income was discovered.  At [42], the Court of  Appeal  considered  that
    there might be a "danger" in this approach; the  correct  approach  was
    that the discrepancy might raise a "suspicion" but did  not  in  itself
    justify  the  conclusion  that  the  individual  was  dishonest.    The
    discrepancy called for an  explanation  and,  if  an  explanation  when
    sought is not forthcoming or is unconvincing, it may be legitimate  for
    the Secretary of State to infer dishonesty.   The  Secretary  of  State
    must: "simply decide, considering the discrepancy in the light  of  the
    explanation (or lack of it), whether he is satisfied that the applicant
    has been dishonest."

23. Consequently, since the judge found that the appellant  was  dishonest,
    the only issue in the  appeal  before  me  is  whether  the  judge  was
    lawfully entitled to reach that conclusion.  If she was,  that  is  the
    end of the matter and the appellant has  succeeded.   However,  if  she
    made a material error in reaching that finding, then  the  decision  in
    respect of para 322(5) must be remade now in the light of the  approach
    set out in Balajigari.

24. Mr Howells, on behalf of the Secretary of State relied  principally  on
    headnote (v) in Khan.  That provides as follows:

         "(v) When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

25. Mr Howells submitted that the judge had failed to take into account, in
    her  reasoning  at  paras  16-22,  that   there   was   no   supporting
    documentation from the appellant's accountants to support  his  claimed
    mistake on  their  part.   Mr  Howells  submitted  that,  although  the
    appellant said when one firm closed down and the other had  refused  to
    co-operate, he had referred to texts but these had  not  been  produced
    either.  Likewise, there was no evidence from  his  estranged  wife  to
    support his claim that she had alerted him to  the  discrepancy  during
    their child maintenance proceedings in 2015.  Mr Howells accepted  that
    the headnote in Khan addressed the approach that should be taken by the
    Secretary of State but it ought also to apply to how  a  judge  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal should assess an individual's explanation as to why
    was not dishonest.

26. Mr Howells did not seek to rely upon the second  part  of  the  ground,
    namely that the judge had been wrong to take into account that HMRC had
    not imposed a penalty upon him when he submitted his revised income  in
    2016.  Perhaps straying somewhat from that ground, Mr Howells, instead,
    submitted that what the judge had failed to do was consider the  timing
    of the appellant's further disclosure to the  HMRC  which  resulted  in
    reassessment in August 2016, shortly before the appellant  applied  for
    ILR on 2 September 2016.

27. Mr Malik, who  represented  the  appellant  relied  upon  his  rule  24
    response.  He pointed out that Khan  was  a  judicial  review  decision
    giving guidance to the Secretary of State in the context of a  decision
    taken without an oral hearing such as had occurred in this appeal.  The
    judge, unlike the Secretary of State, could take into account the  oral
    evidence and demeanour of the appellant (or any  other  witnesses)  who
    gave evidence.  The judge was entitled to make  a  holistic  assessment
    and she had done so.  He submitted that the decision in  Khan  did  not
    lay rigid guidelines.  At para 21 the judge had stated that  she  found
    "the  appellant's  explanation  credible  and  reliable".    Mr   Malik
    submitted that this was tantamount to a finding that the appellant  was
    credible.

28. As regards Mr Howells' second point, Mr Malik submitted that  this  was
    not directly raised in the grounds.  The judge had  not  wrongly  taken
    into account  that  the  HMRC  had  not  imposed  a  penalty  upon  the
    appellant.  Rather, the judge had noted that the appellant had made  an
    "unprompted declaration" to HMRC.  Mr Malik submitted that consistently
    with what was said in Khan at [37(vi)(iv)] the judge  was  entitled  to
    take into account: "Whether, at any  stage,  the  applicant  has  taken
    steps to remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps  were  taken
    and the explanation for any significant delay."  (my emphasis).

29. Mr Malik submitted that the Secretary  of  State's  challenge  did  not
    establish perversity on behalf of the judge even if the decision  might
    be considered to be generous.

30. I accept Mr Malik's submission that the approach set out by the  UT  in
    Khan, in particular at headnote (v), is not, nor was it intended to be,
    prescriptive.  It sets out common sense  guidance  as  to  the  factors
    which a decision maker would likely  take  into  account  in  assessing
    whether an individual was dishonest in his dealings with the respondent
    and HMRC.  I do not, however, accept Mr Malik's  submission  that  that
    approach is wholly irrelevant in the context of an  appeal  hearing  in
    which the individual (and indeed others) may give oral evidence.   What
    was said was, of course, in the context of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision making which may not involve any face-to-face contact with the
    individual, although that is likely to become less so as  a  result  of
    the Court of Appeal's decision in Balajigari about the requirements  of
    fairness in cases of this sort.

31. The matter referred to in headnote (v) of Khan remain, in my  judgment,
    equally relevant in the  context  of  an  appeal  hearing.   There,  of
    course, the judge may well have the benefit of oral  evidence,  and  in
    particular from the appellant giving his explanation and which  can  be
    subject to cross-examination.  The rigours of  that  process  may  well
    form a significant part of the judge's assessment  of  the  appellant's
    veracity in respect of his claimed lack of dishonesty.   It  does  not,
    however,  exclude  the  relevance  of  the  absence  of,  for  example,
    supporting documentation from accountants or others and  the  behaviour
    of the individual in respect of correcting discrepancies in  particular
    the timing of any corrective action.

32. Although it is not directly quoted in headnote (v), para [37(v)] of the
    UT judgment encapsulates the approach as follows:

         "Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to a  tax
         return has been dishonest or  merely  careless,  the  Secretary  of
         State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence  pointing  in  each
         direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion by reference
         to that evidence.  In those circumstances, as long as the reasoning
         is rational and the evidence  has  been  properly  considered,  the
         decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned."

33. In my judgment, the words "Secretary of State" can  be  substituted  by
    "the Tribunal" and the proposition is equally correct.

34. In my judgment, the judge did fall into error in this appeal.  I do not
    accept Mr Malik's submission that the judge reached  her  decision,  at
    least visibly so,  on  the  basis  of  accepting  the  credibility  and
    veracity of the appellant during the course of his oral evidence.   The
    judge does not directly quote any of the evidence whether  in-chief  or
    by way of cross-examination given by the appellant.  All that she  says
    at para 21 is that she found "the appellant's explanation credible  and
    reliable".  I do not consider that the judge's reasoning and finding in
    paras 16-22 obviously turned upon an assessment of  the  appellant  and
    his oral evidence.  Had it done so, that might have been  sufficient  -
    at least on a perversity challenge  -  to  sustain  her  reasoning  and
    finding.

35. I accept Mr Howells' submission that the judge failed properly to  take
    into account all the relevant  matters  in  assessing  the  appellant's
    veracity and whether the Secretary of State had established that he was
    dishonest.  There is no reference to  the  absence  of  any  supporting
    evidence from the appellant's two firms of  accountants.   Even  if  it
    could be said that the appellant's evidence  would  be  that  he  could
    obtain nothing from them as one had gone out of business and the  other
    had refused to co-operate, there were still the claimed texts in  which
    he had at least sought supporting evidence from his accountants.   That
    evidence was not produced and the judge did not consider its absence in
    assessing whether the appellant's innocent explanation stood up.  There
    was also no supporting evidence from his estranged wife whom he claimed
    had alerted him to the discrepancy in the disclosure of his  income  to
    the HMRC.

36. Further, Mr Howells was,  in  my  judgment,  right  not  to  pursue  an
    argument that the judge had wrongly taken into account in para 20  that
    the HMRC had not imposed a penalty.  I accept Mr Malik's submission  on
    this issue but that is not what the judge did in para 20.  What she did
    there  was,  however,  to  take  into  account  that  he  had  made  an
    "unprompted declaration to HMRC".  Mr Howells relied on the  fact  that
    the judge, in doing so, had failed to take into account  the  proximity
    of that exercise with the HMRC to the appellant's application  for  ILR
    in September 2016.  Mr Malik, and indeed so did Mr  Howells,  accepted,
    that this point did not directly arise out of the parts of  the  ground
    concerned with para 20.  However, it does arise, in my  judgment,  from
    the general point made in Mr Howells' principal ground that  the  judge
    failed properly to apply the approach in Khan.  The need to have regard
    to the timing of any dealings with HMRC - which could  of  course  'cut
    either way' in any given case - is specifically referred to by  the  UT
    at [37(v)]  which  I  set  out  above.   The  judge,  in  effect,  only
    considered one aspect of the appellant's "unprompted declaration" - and
    treated it as being in his favour - in para 20 without also taking into
    account the timing of those dealings with HMRC.

37. For these reasons, therefore, I am  satisfied  that  the  judge  failed
    properly to grapple with all the  relevant  evidence  in  reaching  her
    finding that the Secretary  of  State  had  not  established  that  the
    appellant was dishonest and so para 322(5) did not apply.

Decision and Disposal

38. The First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  allow  the  appellant's  appeal
    involved the making of an error of law.

39. The Judge's decision to allow the appeal under Art 8 cannot  stand  and
    is set aside.

40. In these circumstances, both representatives  agreed  that  the  proper
    course was to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in  order  to
    remake the Art 8 decision.

41. The judge's decision and findings in  respect  of  para  322(5)  cannot
    stand.  However, it was agreed that the following findings of the judge
    should stand:

          1) in respect of the best  interests  of  the  appellant's  child
             (para 23);

          2) that the requirements of para 276ADE are not  met  (para  24);
             and

          3) that the appellant speaks English and there is no evidence  of
             reliance on public funds (para 26).

42. I also see no reason why the concession, reflected in  para  22,  that,
    apart from para 322(5), the appellant meets  the  requirement  of  para
    276B should not also stand.

43. The appeal is accordingly remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  (to  a
    judge other than Judge Young-Harry) to re-make the decision in  respect
    of Art 8.
