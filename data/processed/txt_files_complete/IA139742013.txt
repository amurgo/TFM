Representation
For the Appellant:      Ms.  M.  Dogra  of  Counsel  instructed  by  Bukhari
                    Chambers Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Ms. J. Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge C H
    Bennett promulgated on 18 June 2014, dismissing the Appellant's  appeal
    against the Respondent's decision dated 12 April  2013  to  remove  him
    from the UK.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born  on  29  April  1973.  His
    claimed personal  and  immigration  histories  are  summarised  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. It is  unnecessary  to  set  those
    matters out here: I refer to aspects of the histories as is  incidental
    for the purposes of this document.

 3. On 28 June 2012 the Appellant made an application for leave  to  remain
    on the basis of long residence, claiming to have remained in the United
    Kingdom since his entry with the assistance of an agent in 1993.  (Home
    Office  records  confirmed  that  he  was  encountered  by  immigration
    officers in May 2007, when he had claimed  -  inconsistently  with  his
    current claim - to have been present in the  UK  for  approximately  11
    years.) The application was refused for reasons set out in  a  'reasons
    for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated 12  April  2013,  and  a  Notice  of
    Immigration Decision of the same date was served on 17 April 2013.  The
    Respondent refused the application with reference to paragraph 276B  of
    the Immigration Rules. Regard was also had to paragraph 276ADE (private
    life) and Appendix FM (family life).

 4. The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

 5. The appeal was dismissed for the reasons set out in  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pooler on 1 August 2014.

 7. The Respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated 11 August 2014  resisting
    the appeal.

Consideration

 8. The challenge before the Upper Tribunal is without any factual merit.

 9.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  clear  and  detailed   adverse
    assessments  of  the  Appellant,  his  supporting  witnesses,  and  his
    supporting documents.

10. In particular the Judge found:

   (i)      The Appellant not to  be  a  reliable,  credible,  or  truthful
         witness (paragraph 29). The Judge's  reasons  for  this  conclusion
         were set out in closely reasoned passages over some 6 ï¿½ pages.

   (ii)     The Appellant's claimed partner, Ms Cristina Brooks, not to  be
         a reliable, credible, or truthful witness (paragraph 30).

   (iii)    The supporting witness Mr  Bahar  Uddin  not  to  be  a  wholly
         reliable or credible witness (paragraph 31).

   (iv)     Certain of the documents  relied  upon  by  the  Appellant,  as
         identified and for  the  reasons  given  at  paragraph  32,  to  be
         deserving of having no weight placed upon them.

   (v)      No weight was to be  placed  on  the  pay  advices  purportedly
         issued by Lahori Karahi Limited (paragraph 33).

11. The Judge went on to reach the following conclusions  at  paragraph  34
    (before then descending to further specifics as set out in paragraph 35
    - which I do not reproduce her):

    "34. In the light of the foregoing, and, crucially, because I  did  not
         consider the Appellant to  be  a  reliable,  credible  or  truthful
         witness and in the light of what I have said  in  relation  to  the
         above documents, I am not satisfied that I have been told the truth
         by him as to

   (a) the length of time for which he has been in the United Kingdom; or

   (b) when he arrived,

   (c) whether he in fact remained in the United Kingdom at all times since
         his arrival, or

   (d) his relationships with [his girlfriend and  their  children]  (other
         than that he is their father)."

12. The Judge also reached an adverse assessment in respect of the  claimed
    "subsisting quasi-connubial relationship, or "partnership"" between the
    Appellant and Ms Brooks, and in respect of  the  claimed  "genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship" between the  Appellant  and  his  two
    children: see paragraph 36, and the reasons set out  at  paragraph  37.
    These conclusions were reached notwithstanding the potentially positive
    aspects of the evidence as identified and expressly taken into  account
    at paragraph 38. See further in this regard paragraph 39 in the context
    of the possible application of EX.1 of Appendix FM.

13. Putting aside any issue as to whether the post 9 July 2012  Rules  were
    applicable, in so far as they might have been the Judge's  analysis  of
    the requirements of paragraph 276ADE and of Appendix  FM  was  entirely
    consistent with his factual conclusions.

14. In  the  alternative,  if  the  Rules  were  not  applicable  and/or  a
    'freestanding' consideration of Article  8  was  required  outside  the
    'old' Rules, any such consideration was, as identified by the Judge  at
    paragraph 50, appropriately undermined by the conclusion  derived  from
    the primary findings of fact that the Appellant had not shown  that  he
    enjoyed family life in the United Kingdom with his claimed  girlfriend,
    his children, or any other person: as  such  the  conclusion  that  his
    removal would not involve any interference with his or their rights  to
    family life was inevitable.

15. The Judge acknowledged that there would be  an  interference  with  the
    Appellant's  private  life,  but   concluded   that   this   would   be
    proportionate (paragraph 51). Realistically, given  the  admitted  poor
    immigration history, and more particularly the Judge's conclusions that
    the Appellant had not been truthful in his evidence as to  the  details
    of his history and had provided supporting documents that could not  be
    relied upon, the public interest in maintaining  effective  immigration
    control by a  consistent  application  of  published  rules  inevitably
    outweighed an uncertain and untruthful presentation of private life  by
    a  person  who  had  demonstrably  disregarded  the   requirements   of
    immigration control, and was  prepared  to  be  untruthful  before  the
    Tribunal in seeking to gain an immigration advantage.

16. In my judgement the  significant  adverse  findings  to  which  I  have
    referred  are  clearly  set  out  and  explained  by  the  Judge   with
    sustainable reasoning.

17. In as much as the grounds in support of the application for  permission
    to appeal have sought to challenge these findings - and in as  much  as
    Ms Dogra has sought to raise further matters in her  Skeleton  Argument
    dated  15  September  2014  -  the  matters  advanced  are  essentially
    assertions of disagreement and/or attempts to reargue the case: see for
    example the grounds at paragraphs 5, 8, 9, 12-13, 16-18.  I  note  that
    the allegation of bias at paragraph 6 of the grounds was expressly  not
    pursued before me, and paragraph 7 is wholly  misconceived.  Paragraphs
    19 and 20 are also  misconceived:  the  Judge  gave  very  careful  and
    particular consideration to the documentary evidence, and  plainly  had
    regard to all relevant facts in reaching his decision. In my  judgement
    there is nothing of  any  substance  in  paragraph  14  that  otherwise
    undermines the careful reasoning in respect of the facts and issues  at
    the core of the Appellants claim and appeal.

18. The only other argument advanced on behalf  of  the  Appellant  in  the
    grounds is that pursuant to the decision in Edgehill  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    402 the Judge erred in having regard to the 'new' Rules (paragraphs 10-
    11 of the grounds). It is on this point in particular that Ms Dogra has
    focused in her Skeleton Argument, no doubt  encouraged  in  some  small
    part by its identification  as  an  arguable  issue  in  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal.

19. However, for the reasons already given, it is clear to me that even  if
    there were an error in this regard the same outcome on the  appeal  was
    inevitable given the findings of fact which have not been  successfully
    impugned.

20. In my judgement, whatever approach is taken to the case  -  whether  by
    reference to any or all of paragraphs 276B, A277C, 276ADE and  Appendix
    FM as considered by  the  Respondent  in  the  RFRL,  or  perhaps  more
    generously  or  favourably  by  reference  to  paragraph  276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the  ECHR  as  relied  upon  in  the
    Appellant's application of 28 June 2012  -  and  thereby  whether  with
    reference to the 'rule regime' either before or after 9 July 2012 - the
    factual findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  are  such  that  the
    Appellant has no prospect of demonstrating a basis  for  the  grant  of
    leave to remain.

21. In such circumstances the Respondent's pleading in aid in the  Rule  24
    response of the decision in Amarinder Singh [2014] EWHC 2330 (Admin) is
    pertinent. In that case, Mr  Justice  Nicol  found  it  unnecessary  to
    resolve any possible tension between Edgehill  and  Haleemudeen  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 558, because even adopting the approach most favourable to the
    claimant he could not succeed. So  it  is,  in  my  judgement,  in  the
    instant case.

22. My observations above take into account the submission  raised  in  the
    Skeleton Argument of Ms Dogra, but not articulated in  the  grounds  in
    support of the application for permission to  appeal,  that  the  Judge
    failed to  have  regard  to  the  best  interests  of  the  Appellant's
    children. It  seems  to  me  that  in  circumstances  where  the  Judge
    concluded that he was not  satisfied  that  there  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship between the Appellant and his children
    it is readily understandable why section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009 was not pleaded in the grounds in  support  of
    the application for permission to appeal. Moreover, in this context  Ms
    Dogra was unable to identify any specific supporting evidence as to the
    children's best interests beyond the generalised assertions made by the
    Appellant and their mother - both of whom were considered by the  Judge
    to lack credibility, and whose account of a  shared  family  life  with
    their children was rejected. In such circumstances I am  not  persuaded
    that the omission of any express reference to section 55, or  otherwise
    to the best interests of children, amounted to a material error on  the
    very particular facts of this case.

23. For completeness I note that the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  pre-
    dated the introduction of Part 5A into the 2002 Act by  reason  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014, and so there is, and can be, no challenge to  the
    absence of reference to sections 117A-117D

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  contained  no  material
    error of law and stands.

25. The appeal is dismissed.
