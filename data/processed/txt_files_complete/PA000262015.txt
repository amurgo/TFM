Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms H. Ephraim-Adejumo of Counsel, instructed by
                    Solomon Shepherd Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant is national of Angola. The Tribunal makes  an  anonymity
      direction pursuant to Rule 14 of the Upper Tribunal (Procedure  Rules)
      2008 (as amended) in view of the fact that the  circumstances  of  the
      appeal involve minor children  Unless the Upper Tribunal  or  a  court
      orders otherwise,  no  report  of  any  proceedings  or  any  form  of
      publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly   identify   the
      appellant.  This prohibition applies to, amongst others,  all  parties
      and their representatives.


   2. By a decision promulgated on 14 August 2015  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      (Judge Herlihy) dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  decision
      of the Secretary of State dated 12 March 2015 to refuse  to  revoke  a
      Deportation Order (made in 2009) and to refuse the  appellant's  human
      rights claims. The appellant now appeals that decision with permission
      of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. The appellant first came to the United Kingdom in about 1996  using  a
      false identity and claiming to be Portuguese. She  committed  numerous
      offences of dishonesty and was convicted in both her own name and  her
      falsely-adopted name. In 2004 she received a sentence  of  15  months'
      imprisonment.  In 2009 she was arrested trying to leave the country on
      a false French passport, following which  she  was  convicted  by  the
      Crown Court of possession of a false or improperly  obtained  identity
      document and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. She was served with
      a Deportation Order and deported to Angola on 20 July  2009.  Her  two
      sons (now aged 16 and 13) remained in the United Kingdom and have been
      in the care of their father (who is estranged from the appellant) ever
      since. They became British Citizens in October 2013.

   4. In breach of the Deportation  Order  the  appellant  returned  to  the
      United Kingdom on a date unknown, being apprehended on 13 April  2010.
      In 2012 she married a British Citizen, although she and her husband do
      not live together. On 24 April 2013 the  appellant  gave  birth  to  a
      daughter, a British Citizen. Whilst the parties are separated and  her
      daughter lives with the appellant, her  natural  father  continues  to
      visit and support the child (see [67]  of  the  determination  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal).

   5. The First-tier Tribunal set out  the  applicable  legal  framework  at
      paragraphs [57]-[62] of its determination. Rule 390 of the Immigration
      Rules provides that an application for  revocation  of  a  deportation
      order will be  considered  in  the  light  of  all  the  circumstances
      including (i) the grounds on  which  the  order  was  made;  (ii)  any
      representations made in support of the revocation; (iii) the interests
      of  the  community,  including  the  maintenance   of   an   effective
      immigration  control;  and  (iv)  the  interests  of  the   applicant,
      including any compassionate circumstances. Rule 390A  sets  out  that,
      where rule 398 applies, the Secretary of State will  consider  whether
      399 or 399A applies and that, if not, it will only be  in  exceptional
      circumstances that the public interest in maintaining the  deportation
      order will be outweighed by other factors.

   6. The exception relied upon by  the  appellant  is  under  rule  399(a),
      namely, that she is in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a
      child under 18 years of age, who is in the UK and is a British Citizen
      and that:
      (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the country to
      which the person is to be deported; and
      (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK without
      the person who is to be deported;

   7. The judge's central finding, for present purposes, was that,  although
      the appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with her three
      children who are British citizens and reside here, it was  not  unduly
      harsh for the two older children to remain here without the  appellant
      and it was not unduly harsh for the youngest child (now 2  years  old)
      to live in the country to which the appellant was to be deported.  The
      appellant's case therefore did not fall  within  rule  399(a)  of  the
      Immigration Rules.

   8. The appellant was granted permission to appeal on the grounds that the
      judge had (a) failed properly to address and decide the "unduly harsh"
      issues arising under paragraph 399(a) in that she failed  properly  to
      consider the effect on the appellant's children of going  to  live  in
      Angola or of remaining in the UK without the appellant and  (b)  erred
      in taking into account the scale of  the  appellant's  criminality  in
      considering whether her deportation would be unduly harsh on her older
      children, such an approach being inconsistent with the decision in MAB
      (paragraph 399, "unduly harsh") USA [2015] 435 (IAC).

   9. At the hearing of the  appeal  Ms  Ephraim-Adejumo,  Counsel  for  the
      appellant, did not expand on either of those grounds  of  appeal,  but
      deployed a further argument, to which  we  will  return.  As  for  the
      grounds on which permission was granted we have reached the  following
      conclusions:

     a. The contention that the judge did not consider the  effect  on  the
        appellant's older children is not sustainable on a fair  or  proper
        reading of paragraph [66] of the judge's reasons. The judge  starts
        by setting out the appellant's contention that it would  be  unduly
        harsh for her older children to live with her in Angola or  if  she
        returned alone to be separated from them. There is then a  detailed
        consideration of the appellant's relationship with those  children,
        including the fact that she has not lived with them  for  6  years,
        that she could communicate with them by  modern  means,  that  they
        could meet in Portugal and that  there  is  no  evidence  that  the
        appellant has  played  a  significant  role  in  their  upbringing.
        Although referring to the steps the appellant could take  to  avoid
        undue hardship, it  is  in  our  view  clear  that  the  judge  was
        considering whether there would be undue hardship for the children.
        We find no error of law in the judge's approach in this regard.

     b. The Tribunal in MAB  did  indeed  decide  that  the  evaluation  of
        whether the effect of deportation would be unduly harsh on children
        was to be  considered  independently  of  the  public  interest  in
        deporting the foreign criminal, and therefore was unaffected by the
        degree of criminality in question. However, in KMO (section  117  -
        unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543 (IAC) Upper Tribunal  Judge
        Southern reached the opposite  conclusion,  having  considered  the
        reasoning of the panel in MAB in reaching his own conclusion.  Miss
        Ephraim-Adejumo did not address us on which of the two decisions we
        should follow. Having considered  both  decisions,  we  prefer  the
        reasoning set out in KMO.  In a  detailed  and  carefully  reasoned
        decision, Judge Southern pointed out that s117A (2) of the 2002 Act
        provides that,  in  considering  whether  an  interference  with  a
        person's right to respect of private and family life  is  justified
        under Article 8(2) ECHR, the tribunal must in all cases  concerning
        the  deportation  of  a  foreign  criminal  have  regard   to   the
        considerations listed in  s117C.   Those  considerations  expressly
        include, by virtue of s117C (2), that the more serious the  offence
        committed by a foreign criminal, the greater is the public interest
        in the  deportation  of  the  criminal.  Judge  Southern  therefore
        concluded that there is nothing in the rules, or  the  statute,  to
        eliminate  from  an  assessment   of   what   is   "unduly   harsh"
        considerations of the seriousness of  the  offence  committed.   We
        entirely agree with that analysis and find that there was no  error
        of law in the judge's approach in this case. The  Judge  was  fully
        entitled to take into account, as she did (see [66] and [71]),  the
        scale of the appellant's criminality, that almost the  entirely  of
        her time in the UK has been spent here illegally, that she has used
        numerous false identities and has perpetrated  serious  fraud,  she
        had failed to repay the sums ordered by  the  court  following  her
        conviction for fraud despite having owned a property which was sold
        and generated a profit of �20,000. Therefore in those circumstances
        and against that background, it was open to the judge to reach  the
        conclusion that it was in  the  public  interest  to  maintain  the
        deportation order.


  10. We should add that, even if (contrary to our finding above) there  was
      an error of law in the judge's reasoning, we consider  that  it  would
      not have been material. On the findings of fact made by the First-tier
      Tribunal judge, as   the  appellant  does  not  live  with  her  older
      children and can take her two year-old child with her and raise her in
      Angola, we can see no basis  on  which  it  could  be  said  that  the
      deportation of  the  appellant  would  cause  undue  hardship  to  the
      children. The Rules contemplate separation as being a possible outcome
      of deportation proceedings (or the  continuation  of  the  deportation
      order) and thus it is not sufficient to say  that  it  is  "harsh"  to
      separate the parties involved. Furthermore, it is not  sufficient  for
      the Appellant to point to the fact that the Appellant  has  a  genuine
      and subsisting relationship with a child under 18  who  is  a  British
      citizen because,  overlaying  those  features  of  the  case,  is  the
      requirement for separation to be "unduly harsh". Whilst  it  might  be
      said that the children may find separation from  their  mother  to  be
      harsh, the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  did not  establish
      that it would be "unduly harsh" for them to remain in the UK if  there
      mother was removed from the UK when balanced against the strong public
      interest considerations identified by the judge.   Thus  the  evidence
      before the judge did not  establish  the  existence  of  unduly  harsh
      consequences for the children involved.

  11. Ms Ephraim-Adejumo's  additional  argument  was  that  the  judge,  in
      reaching her decision, failed to take into account properly or at  all
      the respondent's duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children
      as set out in section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration
      Act 2009. However, that provision  was  expressly  considered  by  the
      respondent in her decision  letter.  The  judge,  in  turn,  expressly
      considered  at   the   outset,   before   considering   countervailing
      considerations, what was in the best interest of each of the  children
      (see paragraphs 64 and 67 of her reasons). We are therefore  satisfied
      that the judge had the welfare  of  the  children  fully  in  mind  as
      required by section 55 and that she made  no  error  of  law  in  that
      regard. It was unnecessary for the judge to refer expressly to section
      55 provided that she had proper regard to the duty it imposes: see  AJ
      (India) [2011] EWCA Civ 1191.

  12. We therefore find no error of law in the decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal and that the decision should stand.
