                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal  by  the  claimant  from  the  determination  of  Mr
      Radcliffe, Adjudicator, sitting on 2 July 2003.

2.    The grounds of appeal which are before us expressly disavow any  claim
      under the Refugee Convention by paragraph 2 but, do  assert  that  the
      Adjudicator did not adequately  consider  the  human  rights  position
      should the claimant be returned to Liberia.

3.    In paragraph 3 of the grounds of appeal the  Human  Rights  Convention
      point is specifically made, and in paragraph 4 complaint is made  that
      the Adjudicator does  not  appear  adequately  to  have  assessed  the
      background material that was before him.   It is on  that  basis  that
      leave to appeal was granted.

4.    It  seems  to  us  that  there  is  force  in  the  criticism  of  the
      Adjudicator's  lack  of  apparent  consideration  of  the   background
      situation in  Liberia.    However,  whatever  the  position  then  the
      Adjudicator was dealing with a situation that has now  been  overtaken
      by events, because since his determination, from 18 August 2003, there
      has been a cease-fire in Liberia and the  position  now  is  radically
      different from that which obtained before.   We have been assisted  in
      assessing what the situation for returning Liberians  actually  is  by
      the October 2003 CIPU Country Report on Liberia and also by an article
      which has been submitted to us by  Ms  Thirumaney  appearing  for  the
      claimant, for which we are grateful from Amnesty International, headed
      "Liberia  urgent  protection  needed  as  peace  remains  elusive  for
      thousands of civilians".   This article is dated 24 November 2003  and
      deals with matters that have very  recently  been  discovered  by  its
      authors.

5.    It must be borne in mind of course that in this case if  the  claimant
      were to be returned to Liberia, he would be returned to  Monrovia,  he
      would not be returned to any  other  part  of  that  country.   It  is
      therefore important to consider what the position nowadays actually is
      there.    This is covered in a few paragraphs in the CIPU  report  and
      we shall quote in so far as is necessary those paragraphs which appear
      to us to be relevant.

      "5.18  There  has  been  a  reduction  in  violence  in  areas   where
           peacekeepers have been deployed, particularly  around  Monrovia,
           but the  situation  remains  tense.   There  have  been  clashes
           between rebels and government forces,  in  particular  there  is
           heightened tension between MODEL and government  forces  in  the
           south of the country around the port city of Buchanan.  The city
           is reported to be controlled by rebel forces.


      At paragraph 6.49 there is a general over view of the situation:


      "6.49 On  1  August  2003  the  UN  Security  Council  sanctioned  the
           deployment of a multi-national peacekeeping force to the region.
            This was at the request of the Secretary - General, and adopted
           as Resolution 1497 (2003).   Under  Resolution  1509  (2003),  a
           United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) was sanctioned  for  a
           period of twelve months.  This resolution stated that  UNMIL  is
           to be made up of 15,000 peacekeepers, whose primary  mission  is
           to monitor the peace agreement, and assist in the maintenance of
           law and order.


      At paragraph 6.54


      "6.54 Conditions within Monrovia have improved, but the  provision  of
           basic services remains poor.  In the country generally,  violent
           clashes between rebel and government supporters,  has  made  the
           provision of aid, and reporting on conditions  in  these  areas,
           very  difficult.    In  July  2003,  the  UNHCR  requested  that
           governments do not enforce the removal of failed Liberian asylum
           seekers for a period of six months.  This was in response to the
           upsurge in violence, and the resulting difficulties in providing
           protection to the general population."


            Of course the UNCHR's request was made  at  the  height  of  the
           fighting and a month before the cease-fire came into effect.


6.    The Amnesty International document points to matters already  referred
      to in the CIPU report, in particular to the continuing  violence  that
      exists outside areas which are patrolled by UNMIL.  I will quote  from
      what appeared to us to be the relevant passages of that document:

      "Although the  capital  Monrovia  enjoys  an  uneasy  calm  after  the
      devastating events of June and July attacks on the civilian population
      by former government  forces  and  the  two  armed  opposition  groups
      Liberians United  for  Reconciliation  of  Democracy  (LURD)  and  the
      Movement for Democracy in Liberia  (MODEL)  are  continuing  in  Bong,
      Nimba and Grand Bassa counties.

      During  their  two  week  visit  to  Liberia  Amnesty  International's
      delegates met large numbers of internally displaced  people  in  camps
      around Monrovia in Kakata in Margibi county,  Totota in  Bong  country
      and also in Sagleiyie in Mimba county.    Those in Kakata  and  Totota
      described how their villages were attacked and looted by  LURD  forces
      and how as they fled their few remaining  possessions  were  taken  by
      former government forces based around Sanoyie.  Those in Sagleiyie had
      fled MODEL forces as they advanced towards Tapeta  and  Graie  killing
      looting and destroying villages.  Predominantly Krahn MODEL forces are
      attacking those from the Mano and Gio ethnic  groups  in  the  country
      because of their assumed support for former President Charles Taylor".

      "It is clear the presence  of  UN  Troops  offers  protection  to  the
      civilian population in a few areas where they are currently  deployed"
      Amnesty  International  said  "what  is  needed  urgently   is   swift
      deployment of  additional  forces  with  adequate  logistical  support
      beyond Monrovia and the main route to Gbarnga.    Once  deployed  they
      should vigorously pursue their mandate to protect civilians".

 7.   It is also pointed out that as yet nothing like  the  full  compliment
      of 15,000 troops has been deployed; it is unlikely that they  will  be
      deployed until March next year some 4,500 troops are in place."

8.    Drawing the threads of these accounts together, it seems to us  to  be
      tolerably clear that the position if a person is returned to  Monrovia
      is not such any longer as to  engage  Article  3.   The  situation  in
      Monrovia is tense but it is under control.   Monrovia is an area where
      there are UN troops in numbers and they are able to keep the peace  in
      that city.   Further it  is  apparent  from  the  fact  that  internal
      displacement camps have been visited  by  Amnesty  International  both
      that such camps function and further that they  are  open  to  outside
      scrutiny.  There is no criticism of the safety of the people  who  are
      in those  camps  at  present.    We  are  confident  that  if  Amnesty
      International had discovered that there were any security problems for
      those who are at present in internal  displacement  camps  they  would
      have said so in this report.   In the absence of such evidence we feel
      that we are in a position to conclude that  if  returned  to  Monrovia
      this claimant, although a  Mandingo  and  a  Muslim  would  be  at  no
      particular enhanced risk over and above that  run  by  other  Liberian
      citizens.    Further we come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  ordinary
      Liberian citizen himself if in Monrovia or in the camps near there  is
      at not real risk of Article 3 harm.

9.    In all those circumstances, we  consider  that  this  appeal  must  be
      dismissed, for we  do  not  consider  that  the  stringent  conditions
      necessary for the provisions of Article  3  to  be  invoked  exist  at
      present in the Monrovia area; the area to  which  returns  would  take
      place.
