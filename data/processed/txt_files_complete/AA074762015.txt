For the Appellant: Dr Mynott for Broudie Jackson and Cantor
For the Respondent: Mr G Harrison Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.
3. This is a resumed hearing following a decision made by me promulgated  on
   11 March 2016 that the First-tier Tribunal failed to determine whether it
   could depart from the country guidance in AT  and  others  (Article  15c:
   Risk Categories Libya) CG [2014] UKUT 318  (IAC)  on  the  basis  of  the
   additional country material placed before it,

4. The Appellant did not attend the appeal but Dr  Mynott  appeared  on  her
   behalf. There was no  explanation  for  her  non  attendance  .Dr  Mynott
   indicated that she was aware of  the  hearing  date  and  the  solicitors
   remain instructed. He was content to proceed by way of  submissions  only
   as he was relying on all of the documentary material before the court. Mr
   Harrison indicated that he was content to proceed in the absence  of  the
   Appellant.

5. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr  Harrison  on  behalf  of  the
   Respondent that :

   a) The issue to be addressed was whether the court could  go  behind  the
      decision in AT.

   b) He acknowledged the two  documents  produced  by  Dr  Mynott  were  of
      relevance: the case of MTMA in which he stated his 'provisional  view'
      was that the authority of AT as country guidance should be removed and
      the June 2016 Version1.0 COI Report 'Libya : Security and humanitarian
      situation..

   c)  He acknowledged that no enforced returns were being made because  the
      FCO advice was that it was unsafe for British citizens to go to  Libya
      so there could be no British escorts but this  did  not  mean  that  a
      Libyan could not return.

   d) He accepted that given the Appellants husband and child  were  British
      citizens he was not arguing that they should return with the Appellant
      so the factual basis on which the case shoud be addressed was that she
      would return alone.

   e)  He accepted that Tripoli airport was still closed.

6. On behalf of the Appellant Dr Mynott submitted that :

   a) He relied on the material that was before the previous Judge  together
      with the new bundle.

   b) He relied on the new COIS just published by the Respondent a matter of
      days ago. The new policy acknowledged that a number of areas in  Libya
      breached Article 15(c) and the importance of assessing individual risk
      factors. Paragraph 2.4.1 acknowledged the restrictions on travel which
      raised the question of how someone could enter the country  or  travel
      to their home area.

   c) He highlighted and detailed those aspects of the new evidence that  he
      had adduced which showed the escalating violence and the  causal  link
      between civilian security and the conflict.

   d) He referred to the material that was before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      that showed particular problems for women and that lone women were  at
      greater risk in Libya.

   e) He summarised by stating that the evidence showed that there were high
      levels of indiscriminate violence throughout Libya. There was no  safe
      route for the Appellant as a lone woman to even enter or travel within
      the country.

Legal Framework

   7. Paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules states that an applicant,  who
      does not qualify as a refugee, will be granted humanitarian protection
      if the provisions of that paragraph apply. The burden of  proof  rests
      on an  Appellant  to  satisfy  me  that  he  or  she  is  entitled  to
      humanitarian protection under paragraph 339 of the Immigration  Rules.
      In essence, an Appellant will have to show that there are  substantial
      grounds for believing that, if returned, the Appellant  would  face  a
      real risk of suffering serious harm and that he or she is  unable  or,
      owing to such risk, unwilling to  avail  himself  or  herself  of  the
      protection of the country of return. Serious harm in this  context  is
      defined as the death penalty or execution, unlawful  killing,  torture
      or inhuman or degrading treatment  or  punishment  or  a  serious  and
      individual threat to a civilians  life  by  reason  of  indiscriminate
      violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict

   8. Article 15(c) of  Council  Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the  Qualification
      Directive") defines serious harm within the Directive as:


             "serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or  person
             by  reason  of  indiscriminate  violence  in   situations   of
             international or internal armed conflict."

   9. The Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") gave  judgment  in
      Diakitï¿½ (Case C-285/12) in which it was held that:


             "on a  proper  construction  of  Article  15(c)  of  Directive
             2004/83, it  must  be  acknowledged  that  an  internal  armed
             conflict exists, for the purposes of applying that  provision,
             if a State's armed forces confront one or more armed groups or
             if two or more armed groups confront each  other.  It  is  not
             necessary for  that  conflict  to  be  categorised  as  'armed
             conflict   not   of   an   international   character'    under
             international humanitarian law; nor is it necessary  to  carry
             out, in addition to an appraisal  of  the  level  of  violence
             present in the territory concerned, a separate  assessment  of
             the intensity  of  the  armed  confrontations,  the  level  of
             organisation of the armed forces involved or the  duration  of
             the conflict."


10. The CJEU has highlighted the 'exceptional situation' needed for Article
    15(c) to apply to civilians generally. In Elgafaji v.  Staatssecretaris
    van Justitie, C-465/07 at paragraph 37, the Court made clear that, for
    this to be the case-

             '[...] the degree of  indiscriminate  violence  characterising
             the armed conflict taking place ... [must reach] such  a  high
             level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that  a
             civilian, returned to the relevant country or, as the case may
             be, to the relevant region, would, solely on  account  of  his
             presence on the territory of that country or  region,  face  a
             real risk of being subject to the serious threat  referred  in
             Article 15(c) of the Directive.'




  11. The current country guidance case on Libya is AT and  Others  (Article
      15c; risk categories) Libya CG [2014] UKUT 318 (IAC). It was  held  in
      AT that there is not such a high level of indiscriminate  violence  in
      Libya, within the  meaning  of  Article  15(c)  of  Council  Directive
      2004/83/EC  ("the  Qualification  Directive")  so  as  to  mean   that
      substantial grounds exist for  believing  that  an  individual  would,
      solely by being present there, face a real risk which threatens his or
      her life or person. It is noteworthy that it was promulgated  in  July
      2014 but is based on country evidence up  to  and  including  November
      2013. The Tribunal stated-


     a. There were limited enforced returns at the time  but  what  returns
        took place went via Tripoli International airport  using  scheduled
        airlines.


     b. Checkpoints had more than one purpose with the militia  using  them
        to charge protection money, searching for drugs or alcohol as  well
        as checking who was actually  passing  through.  Not  everyone  was
        stopped as evidenced  by  the  personal  evidence  of  one  of  the
        experts. Road travel had improved throughout 2013 and  it  was  now
        possible to travel by car throughout most of  the  country  despite
        there being the possibility of harassment from militias.

     c. The airports of Tripoli and Benghazi were for the  most  part  safe
        with little immediate danger flying into them or  transiting  them.
        At the time  numerous  international  carriers,  including  British
        Airways, Alitalia,  Air  France  and  Lufthansa,  operated  with  a
        reasonable regularity.

12. In relation to the status of CG cases in SG (Iraq) v SSHD; OR  (Iraq)  v
   SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 940 the Court of Appeal said that the  CG  procedure
   was aimed at arriving at a reliable and accurate determination and it was
   for those reasons, as well  as  the  desirability  of  consistency,  that
   decision-makers  and  tribunal  judges  were  required  to  take  country
   guidance determinations into account, and  to  follow  them  unless  very
   strong grounds supported by  cogent  evidence,  were  adduced  justifying
   their not doing so (paras 43 - 50).


Findings on Article 15(c)

13. I have looked at the evidence in the round taking into  account  all  of
   the evidence both oral submissions and written material whether  I  refer
   to it specifically or not.  In the light of my analysis of  the  evidence
   above I make the following findings

14. I am solely  concerned  with  an  appeal  under  article  15(c)  of  the
   Qualification  Directive  (2004/83/EC).  All  of  the  Appellant's  other
   appeals have been  previously  dealt  with  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   including her applications for asylum, articles 3 and 8 ECHR.

15.  The  findings  made  by  the  First-tier  Judge  as   to   her   family
   circumstances in Libya, that she did not accept the  credibility  of  her
   account, remain unchallenged. The Appellant has married a British citizen
   Fareid Ali and they have a baby born in  November  2015.  The  Appellants
   case is that her husband and child would not return with her to Libya  as
   it is in her husband's words a 'war zone'. Their intention, even  if  she
   were to return, would be for her to re-join her husband in the  UK  under
   the Immigration Rules and therefore I accept that they would not wish  to
   subject their child to the risks inherent in living in Libya even on  any
   assessment of the situation there and even if it were for a limited time.
   Mr Harrison furthermore did not seek to argue  this  case  on  any  other
   basis than that the Appellant would be  returning  to  Libya  as  a  lone
   female. The First-tier Judge found that she had  immediate  and  extended
   family living in the Tripoli area. That would therefore be the  basis  on
   which I assess this case.

16. I am satisfied that I have been provided with strong  grounds  supported
   by  cogent  evidence  that  conditions  in   Libya   have   significantly
   deteriorated such that I can depart from the guidance in AT in respect of
   a lone female returning to the Tripoli area which, if  I  were  following
   the guidance in AT, would not have breached Article 15(c).

17. I note that AT that the case was underpinned by an assertion that  there
   were limited enforced returns at the time  and  these  were  via  Tripoli
   International airport using scheduled airlines. This  Appellant,  it  was
   found, was from Tripoli so at the time of AT there would have appeared to
   be a safe route of return. That is no longer the case as Tripoli  Airport
   shut on 13 July 2014 after extensive fighting and the Respondent in their
   FCO advice acknowledge on 20 June 2016 that all airports in  the  country
   are closed and some border crossings are closed which I am satisfied is a
   reflection of the deteriorating security situation in  the  country.  The
   USSD advice talks of the danger to  flights  as  there  are  antiaircraft
   weapons in the hands of armed groups (page 12 Appellants bundle) No clear
   argument was advanced by Mr Harrison how in practical terms the Appellant
   could return to Tripoli if there are no flights and border crossings  are
   closed. Even if she were able to travel overland the  suggestion  in  the
   FCO  that  a  number  of  border  crossings  are  also  closed  and   the
   deteriorating country situation puts the safety of alternative routes  in
   issue and I was not told of any border crossing that would  have  allowed
   the Appellant a safe route of return. I am satisfied  that  there  is  no
   longer a route to Libya that does  not  pose  an  unacceptable  risk  and
   particularly one to a lone female and there is reference to the increased
   risk posed to women  since the revolution (Page 70 AB1), in a UN document
   dated 15 May 2015 at page 90 of the first bundle and by militias  now  at
   page 24 of the Appellants second bundle .

18. There is clear evidence from both the Respondent and in  the  Appellants
   bundles of the increasing levels of indiscriminate violence since AT  was
   promulgated. There was persuasive material from a number  of  independent
   organisations including the FCO at the high number of deaths and injuries
   amongst civilians as a result of the conflict (page 36-37 AB  2)  At  the
   time of this document, March 2015, the FCO itself conceded that the worst
   fighting  was  in  Tripoli.  There  is  also  a   report   from   Amnesty
   International dated 24 February 2016 that also highlights the causal link
   between the conflict and the indiscriminate nature of the violence.

19. The June 2016 COIS,  the  Respondent's  own  policy  guidance  document,
   produced by Dr Mynott acknowledges that the security situation  generally
   in Libya has deteriorated since AT was  promulgated.  It  summarises  the
   situation in this way at 2.3.14

   "During 2015 and into 2016 multiple armed conflicts have contributed to a
   further breakdown of law and order. All parties  to  the  conflicts  have
   continued to commit violations of  international  humanitarian  law,  and
   abuses of human rights. Warring factions have  caused  multiple  civilian
   deaths and injuries, and civilians have comprised up to 79% of casualties
   from the use of explosive weapons in some populated areas. Exact  figures
   on the number of civilian casualties are not available, and the data that
   is available may be an underestimate, but sources have reported that  out
   of a population estimated to be 6.4 million, there were over 1,500 deaths
   (of combatants and civilians) and 20,000 injured in  2015  (approximately
   0.02% killed and 0.31% injured of the total population")

20. The guidance acknowledges that some cities are more violent than  others
   and are now likely to breach Article 15(c) but  Tripoli  is  asserted  at
   2.3.15 to be less so although it goes on to say at 2.3.18:

   "Even where there is no general Article 15 (c) risk, the  decision  maker
   must consider whether  there  are  particular  factors  relevant  to  the
   person's individual circumstances which might nevertheless place them  at
   risk. Such factors might include-but are not  limited  to-  the  person's
   age, gender and health."

21. There is an HRW report dated January  27  2016  (Page  13-14  AB)  which
   talks of a deepening political and  security  crisis  and  that  included
   fighting in and around Tripoli:

   "Forces engaged in the conflict continued with  impunity  to  arbitrarily
   detain, torture, unlawfully kill,  indiscriminately  attack,  abduct  and
   disappear, and forcefully displace people from their homes.....

   Warring factions indiscriminately  shelled  civilian  areas,  arbitrarily
   seized people, tortured  and  looted,  burned,  and  otherwise  destroyed
   civilian property in attacks that sometimes amounted to war crimes ."



22.  In  considering  whether  the  Appellant   would   face   a   risk   of
   indiscriminate violence I have considered all of the evidence  served  in
   this appeal. I have taken as  my  starting  point  the  findings  of  the
   Tribunal in AT and Others and but I have then considered  the  additional
   evidence that post dates that decision and that  includes  not  only  the
   reports on fighting but also the fact the numbers  of  displaced  persons
   has increased. I have accepted that in practical terms the closure of all
   airports and the deteriorating security situation which is well evidenced
   reflects the increasing levels of indiscriminate violence. I am satisfied
   that as a lone woman returning even if some  safe  route  were  available
   would make the Appellant that mush more vulnerable that a male.

23. I am satisfied that the additional evidence, post AT and  Others,  would
   result in a breach of article 15(c) if the Appellant were returned


DECISION

24. The appeal is allowed
