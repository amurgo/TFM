For the Appellant:      Ms S Alban, Fountain Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge A D
    Baker in which she dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, a citizen  of
    Guinea, against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse asylum  and
    issue removal directions.

 2. The application under  appeal  was  refused  on  13  March  2017.   The
    Appellant exercised his right of appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    This is the appeal which came before Judge Baker on 26  June  2017  and
    was dismissed. The Appellant applied for permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  The application was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Brunnen on 9 October 2017 in the following terms

           The grounds on which permission to appeal is sought submit  that
           the judge failed to  give  adequate  reasons  for  attaching  no
           weight to a newspaper article and for finding that a website  on
           which the Appellant  claimed  to  have  posted  an  article  was
           "closed" (as opposed to publicly  accessible).  It  is  arguable
           that it is  not  apparent  from  paragraph  37  of  the  Judge's
           decision what led her to find that the website was closed. It is
           arguable that if she had made a different finding on this point,
           she might have taken a different view of the newspaper.




Background

 3. The history of this appeal  is  detailed  above.  The  Appellant  is  a
    citizen of Guinea born on 21 December 1980.  He  claims  to  have  left
    Guinea in October 2009 to study in Malaysia and he came to the UK as  a
    student arriving in September  2015.  He  became  involved  in  Guinean
    politics from about 2007 and was a member  of  the  Union  of  Guinea's
    Democratic Forces (UFDG) and he continued to work for this organisation
    whilst he was in Malaysia and the United Kingdom. The core of his claim
    related to an article he claimed to have written under a pen name  that
    was posted on the Guinea news website on 5 September 2016. This article
    was used two days later in  a  talk  show  when  the  Guinean  Interior
    minister was interviewed, and the embarrassment caused resulted in  the
    Guinean authorities going to  the  Appellant's  home  and  abusing  his
    family.  The Appellant's father  was  later  summonsed  to  the  police
    station and asked when the Appellant would be returning to the country.
    A newspaper article was said to confirm what had happened on the  radio
    programme.


 4. The Judge dismissed the appeal finding, after  hearing  oral  evidence,
    that the Appellant's account lacked credibility and in particular  that
    the internet article that he claimed to have published was posted on  a
    "closed website" and that the newspaper produced  was  not  a  reliable
    document due  to  its  late  production  and  the  Appellant's  overall
    credibility.



Submissions


 5. For the Appellant Ms Alban said that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for placing no weight on the  newspaper  article.  The
    Judge says that this should have been produced earlier but this was not
    put to the Appellant or  raised  by  the  Respondent.  A  copy  of  the
    newspaper article was in the Appellant's bundle and  the  original  was
    produced at the hearing. At  paragraph  34  the  Judge  refers  to  the
    article's reliability "in the context of there being no other evidence"
    but this was wrong, there was other corroborative evidence including  a
    summons for the Appellant's father, his ID and the online article.   At
    paragraph 37 the Judge failed to give adequate reasons for finding that
    the online article appeared, if at all, on a closed  website.  This  is
    factually wrong; the website was accessed by the Respondent. The  Judge
    errs further at paragraph 38 where she places no weight  on  the  blogs
    posted by the Appellant. He  produced  evidence  in  his  supplementary
    bundle at pages 3-16. A viewer only had to click on the articles to see
    the comments.


 6. For the Respondent Mr Mills said that the Respondent  tried  to  access
    the specific online article, but it  was  unobtainable.  There  was  no
    suggestion made by the Respondent and no  submission  made  to  suggest
    that  it  was  a  closed   website.   The   Respondent   accepts   that
    guineenews.org is an active  website  but  does  not  accept  that  the
    article was ever published. The Appellant's evidence was that  articles
    are taken down after 6 months but there is nothing to corroborate this.
    Mr Mills accepted that the Respondent was likely to have made enquiries
    just before the date of the  refusal  letter  so  outside  the  6-month
    period from the claimed publication of  the  article.  So  far  as  the
    newspaper article was  concerned  the  Appellant  claims  that  it  was
    printed in Guinea in September 2016 and was sent to him  by  a  friend.
    The Judge was right to find that it was produced very late in  the  day
    some 9 months after claimed  publication.   The  Judge  gives  adequate
    reasons for rejecting the reliability of the documents. Mr  Mills  said
    that it was accepted that the Judge was wrong to find that the  website
    was "closed" but this was not material to the decision to  dismiss  the
    appeal.


 7. Ms Alban responded to say that the finding that the website was  closed
    was material. The website was open, and the Appellant produced  a  copy
    of the article with the website footer  clearly  shown.  The  delay  in
    producing  the  original  newspaper  article  was  not  raised  by  the
    Respondent at the hearing. It must  be  taken  into  account  that  the
    Appellant was in the United Kingdom throughout the period  in  question
    and had to rely on others to send the newspaper article to him.



Decision


 8. The grounds of appeal and the grant of permission relate solely to  the
    Judge's treatment of the evidence produced  by  the  Appellant  and  in
    particular  the   newspaper   article   from   L'Observateur   entitled
    "Insecurit�  �a  Conakry"  and  an  internet   article   published   on
    guineanews.org. Copies of both of these documents were contained in the
    Appellant's bundle and the original newspaper, including  the  relevant
    article, was produced at the hearing. The Judge found  that  she  could
    place no weight on the newspaper article (paragraph 41). She found that
    there was no evidence on the face  of  the  copy  internet  article  to
    indicate that it was ever published and that the website upon which  it
    was claimed to have been posted was closed.


 9. There can be little doubt that the authenticity of these two  documents
    was fundamental to the Appellant's  claim.  The  internet  article  was
    claimed to have been used to embarrass the Interior Minister  during  a
    radio interview and the newspaper article was said to be  corroboration
    both of the interview and  its  consequences.  So,  if  the  Judge  did
    misdirect  herself  or  give  inadequate  reasons  for   doubting   the
    authenticity of the documents this would be material  to  the  decision
    made.



10.  Dealing  with  the  documents  in  chronological  order  it  was   the
    Appellant's claim that  the  internet  article  was  published  on  the
    guineenews.org website on 5 September 2016 and  that  content  on  this
    website remains available for a period of six months.  It  is  an  open
    website. The Judge found that it is a closed website and that there was
    "no evidence to identify that this was a public website  or  that  (it)
    could be accessed by the public or indeed that it was accessed  by  any
    individual other than him at all". The Judge goes on to find that there
    was no evidence on the face of the document to  indicate  that  it  was
    ever published on the internet.



11.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  this  finding  demonstrates   factual
    inaccuracy. The Respondent did not  suggest  that  this  was  a  closed
    website and indeed accepts before me that it is not.  It  is  a  public
    website that can be accessed by members of the public. The  only  issue
    therefore is whether the article in question was published as claimed.



12. It is pertinent here to  clarify  the  nature  of  the  'article'.  The
    Appellant's claim  is  not  that  this  was  an  article  published  by
    guineenews.org. His claim is that it was an article written by him  and
    posted as a comment on the guineenews.org website (paragraph 7  of  his
    statement). In this respect there is, contrary to the Judge's  finding,
    evidence on the face of the document that  it  was  published  being  a
    standard internet 'footer' - http://www.forumguineenews.org.uk/six-ans-
    dalpha-cond-quel-bilan-pour-la-guinee_topic2098.html. The document also
    shows, as the Appellants claims in his statement at paragraph  11,  the
    date that it was printed being September 15, 2016.  The  Appellant  has
    not produced anything to corroborate his claim that posts  only  remain
    on the site for six months although the Respondent accepts that it  may
    have been outside the period of six months when  the  specific  posting
    was searched by the Respondent  on  the  open  website.  These  factual
    issues are not addressed by the Judge and given the open nature of  the
    website and the production of a copy of the post  with  an  identifying
    footer the issue before the Judge was whether,  in  the  light  of  the
    other evidence, there was a  reasonable  likelihood  that  this  was  a
    genuinely published article. The mistake as to fact means that this was
    not addressed.


13.  The  newspaper  article  must  be  seen   in   the   light   of   this
    misunderstanding of the evidence. At paragraph 34 the Judge  notes  the
    production of the article in  the  context  of  there  being  no  other
    evidence and in paragraph 35 the Judge notes that limited weight can be
    attached to the original  newspaper.  Although  there  is  no  specific
    finding that the two documents produced, the internet posting, and  the
    Newspaper article are false, that  is  the  clear  implication  of  the
    findings. As Ms Alban pointed out  the  Appellant  submitted  not  only
    these documents but documents relating to his father summons which  was
    not  accepted  by  the  Respondent  but  also  his  membership  of  the
    organisation which was accepted.



14. My conclusion from the  above  is  that  the  Judge  misunderstood  the
    evidence pertaining to the internet posting wrongly  finding  that  the
    site to which it was claimed that the article was posted was  'closed'.
    The Judge was further wrong to find that the posting had no evidence on
    the face of it to show that it  was  published  on  the  internet.  The
    Judge's findings in these respects were, in my  judgement,  influential
    in her finding that she could place no weight on what, on the  face  of
    it, is an original newspaper containing an article corroborative of the
    core of the Appellant's claim. The  misunderstanding  of  the  evidence
    caused the Judge to misdirect herself in a manner that was material  to
    her decision to dismiss the appeal. The Appellant's appeal is therefore
    allowed.


  Summary

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of error of
    law material to the decision made. I allow the Appellant's appeal.  The
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  The  nature  of  the
    error of law is fundamental to the credibility findings made and so  in
    accordance with the President's direction I remit  the  matter  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for hearing de novo.
