                            ERROR OF LAW DECISION

Anonymity

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal, dismissing his appeal against the respondent's  decision
    to refuse him international protection under the Refugee Convention  or
    humanitarian protection grounds, or leave to  remain  on  human  rights
    grounds.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and an overstayer.   He  entered
    the United Kingdom on 22 August 2015 with his wife, but made an  asylum
    claim in November 2015.   The basis of the appellant's asylum claim  is
    that he and his wife married contrary to family expectations  and  that
    they were at risk from a disappointed suitor in Pakistan.

 3. There has been a previous decision in relation to the appellant's wife,
    on 23 September 2016, in which the appellant and  his  wife  both  gave
    evidence.  The First-tier Tribunal in the wife's appeal  dismissed  her
    challenge to  the  respondent's  refusal  to  grant  her  asylum.   The
    appellant's evidence was given no weight, as the  wife's  evidence  was
    not considered to be truthful.  On 1  March  2017,  the  appellant  was
    observed working illegally  at  a  shop  called  Pound  Value  and  was
    arrested and detained.  On 10 March 2017, the appellant  sought  asylum
    in his own right.

 4. In or about April 2017, Duncan Lewis solicitors began to  act  for  the
    appellant.  On 16 April 2017, a Rule 35 torture allegation  report  was
    prepared by Dr I Sayed at Harmondsworth  detention  centre,  who  noted
    quite significant body marks: broken teeth,  laceration  scars  on  the
    right ankle and hand and the  left  hand,  and  a  dislocation  of  the
    appellant's left elbow.  The doctor recorded that the appellant said he
    had been beaten with iron rods  and  gun  butts  in  February  2012  in
    Rawalpindi, his home area, and with a stick, a tyre iron and a gun,  in
    Islamabad in October 2013, when he was living away from home to  escape
    the family conflict.  The second attack was carried out by  the  wife's
    uncle, brother, two other men and the disappointed  suitor.   Dr  Sayed
    considered that the scars  'may  be  due  to  the  history  given'  and
    recorded that the appellant still had shoulder and elbow  pain  on  his
    left side.

 5. On 20 April 2017, the respondent accepted that the appellant  had  been
    tortured, but maintained her decision to remove him, on the basis  that
    his 'negative immigration factors' outweighed the  risk  on  return  to
    Pakistan.

 6. On 15  May  2017,  Duncan  Lewis  made  further  submissions,  and  the
    appellant was given a full in-country right of  appeal  on  his  asylum
    claim. The further submissions were supported by a number of documents:
    the Rule 35 report, a translation of  a  letter  purporting  to  record
    multiple visits by 'these people' to the family  home,  the  last  time
    accompanied by uniformed police personnel, asking for  the  address  of
    the appellant and his sister.   On the  second  occasion,  'they  broke
    stuff and intimidated and threatened [the  appellant's  family]'.   The
    letter said the situation was quite bad, as  the  people  came  at  any
    time, day or  night,  sometimes  with  religious  people  (Maulvi)  and
    sometimes with police officers.  They were 'upsetting us considerably'.
    Another letter, from a Tariq Khan, urged the appellant not  to  return,
    and not to divulge his new address, as  the  visitors,  who  frightened
    others in the hostel, wanted to kill him.  An FIR had  been  registered
    but the police were 'in cahoots with these people and  verbally  abused
    us as well'.

 7. There was no medico-legal report accompanying the further  submissions.
    Duncan Lewis began seeking funding for such a  report  in  April  2017.
    They state that a report from Dr Helen Richardson  through  a  charity,
    Medical Justice, was commissioned as soon  as  legal  aid  funding  was
    confirmed.

 8. On the morning  of  the  hearing  on  26  June  2017,  the  appellant's
    representatives applied for a short adjournment,  to  await  a  medico-
    legal report which was then expected to be available by  7  July  2017.
    The appellant had been seen by Dr Richardson on 16 June 2017,  but  her
    report was not yet ready.

 9. The appellant's Counsel,  Ms  Sanders,  submitted  that  following  the
    respondent's acceptance of the contents of the Rule  35  report,  there
    was a need for a medico-legal report giving a more detailed  assessment
    of the  appellant's  injuries.   The  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
    opposed an  adjournment,  arguing  that  the  appeal  could  be  justly
    determined on evidence already before the Upper Tribunal.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal refused the adjournment for the following reasons:

         "15. I refused the application.  I said that in due course I  would
         need to assess the evidence in the round and that the  injuries  to
         the appellant were described in the Rule 35 report.  I said that  I
         would keep matters under review and, if need be,  I  would  adjourn
         part-heard if I later considered that the  hearing  could  only  be
         determined fairly with the report from Dr Richardson.

         16.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I told the  parties  that  I
         saw no need to adjourn part-heard.  Ms  Sanders  asked  me  if  the
         report could be submitted if it became available before my decision
         was promulgated.  ... I was not prepared to consider evidence which
         had not been the subject of submissions during the hearing,  and  I
         was not prepared to delay my decision until such time as the report
         was ready."

10. At paragraphs [52] and [64] the Judge said this:

         "51. The Rule 35 evidence does show that the Appellant has  in  the
         past suffered injuries.  The Appellant gave Dr Sayers an account of
         two incidents in Pakistan in February 2012 and October  2013  which
         are consistent with his account.  Dr Sayers observed broken  teeth,
         lacerations scars on the right ankle and left hand and evidence  of
         dislocated left elbow.  Dr Sayers says that the scars may be due to
         the history given by the Appellant.  The Appellant also  complained
         of shoulder and elbow pain.

         52.  The appellant also  complains  in  his  witness  statement  of
         depression, flashbacks  and  memory  loss.   There  is  no  medical
         evidence  of  this.   I  have  been  provided  with  the  screening
         interview he attended in November 2015.  He said then that  he  had
         no medical conditions, and said nothing  about  any  mental  health
         difficulties. ...

         64.  The medical evidence contained in the  Rule  35  report  shows
         that the appellant has suffered injuries in  the  past,  consistent
         with his account, but it cannot be  said  that  the  injuries  were
         caused in the manner described by the appellant.  The injuries  are
         no doubt consistent with a number of other causes. ..."

11. The Judge's decision dismissing the appeal was sent to the  parties  on
    29 June 2017.



Permission to appeal

12. Grounds of appeal were  settled  promptly,  without  the  report  being
    available.  Dr Richardson's report was produced 2 weeks  later,  on  13
    July 2017. Neither the respondent nor any Tribunal has  yet  considered
    this report.

13. The appellant in his grounds of appeal relied on Nwaigwe  (adjournment:
    fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC), arguing that the appellant had  been
    denied a fair  hearing.   The  appellant  submitted  that  the  Judge's
    failure to adjourn, or at the very least to delay promulgation  pending
    receipt of the Medical Justice report,  denied  the  appellant  a  fair
    hearing as the Judge was unable to take into  account  highly  relevant
    evidence  which  might  have  made  a  difference  to  his  credibility
    assessment, and which would certainly have provided greater detail than
    the Rule 35 report.

14. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the Rule  35  report
    was one of the pieces of new evidence relied upon by this appellant and
    hat there was at least arguable unfairness  to  the  appellant  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal refusing a short adjournment.

Rule 24 reply

15. Following the grant of permission to appeal, the respondent submitted a
    Rule 24 reply as follows:

         "2.  The respondent opposes the appellant's  appeal.   In  summary,
             the respondent will submit inter alia that the  judge  of  the
             First-tier Tribunal directed  themselves  appropriately.   The
             judge was already assisted with the Rule 35  report  that  had
             been prepared for the appellant which documented his injuries.
              As rightly pointed out by the judge, any further report would
             only tell him what was  already  known,  which  was  that  the
             appellant  had  injuries  (Determination  �15).   The  awaited
             medical report, whilst able to document the injuries would not
             be able to establish credibility on  its  own,  this  being  a
             matter for the judge in the round, to be considered  alongside
             the previous appeal determination for the appellant's wife and
             the oral and documentary evidence submitted by the  appellant.
             Given the report had yet to materialise at the date permission
             to appeal was  sought  lends  further  force  to  the  judge's
             decision to proceed.

         3.   The appellant would have been aware of his scars at the  point
             that his wife's application was refused by the respondent  and
             there has been no credible or reasonable explanation as to why
             a report had not been produced in support  of  her  appeal  or
             definitely well in advance of the appellant's own appeal."

16.  That  is  the  basis  on  which  this  appeal  came  before   me   for
    consideration.

Discussion

17. In this appeal, the appellant had been discounted as a witness  in  his
    wife's appeal and his own in-country asylum  appeal  had  been  granted
    specifically because of the torture marks on his body identified in the
    Rule 35 report, which were considered to give him a realistic  prospect
    of success before an immigration judge.   The  effect  of  the  torture
    evidence on credibility was at the heart of the appeal.

18. The First-tier Tribunal assessed credibility afresh, based on the  Rule
    35 report.  However, a Rule 35 report is not a full medico-legal report
    and it is  clear  from  [51]-[52]  and  [64]  that  relevant  questions
    remained unanswered by it.  Given that legal aid funding had been  made
    available for an Istanbul Protocol compliant report  which  might  well
    have assisted the Judge with the question of causation of the injuries,
    which has obvious relevance to credibility,  I am  satisfied  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in excluding any possibility  of  considering
    this evidence before reaching a decision on the appeal.

19. The First-tier Tribunal is bound by the overriding objective set out at
    Rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and
    Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, in particular Rule 2(2)(b) and (e) thereof.
     Rule 2 is as follows:-

         "2.-(1)  The overriding objective of these Rules is to  enable  the
                  Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.

              (2) Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes -      ...

                  (b)    avoiding   unnecessary   formality   and    seeking
                      flexibility in the proceedings ... and

                  (e)  avoiding delay, so  far  as  compatible  with  proper
                      consideration of the issues".

20. In this appeal, I consider that the  Judge's  inflexibility  concerning
    the medical evidence may have  prevented  him  from  dealing  with  the
    appeal fairly and justly.   The cause of the  injuries  may  well  have
    affected the outcome, if the  account,  when  corroborated,  led  to  a
    different view of the appellant's credibility.

Conclusions

In the circumstances, there is a material error of law in  the  decision  of
the First-tier Tribunal.  This decision will be  remade  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal on a date to be fixed.

The medical report of Dr Richardson is to be filed and served within 7  days
of the sending out of this decision.
