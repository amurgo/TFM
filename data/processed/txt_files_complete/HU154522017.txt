Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Walsh of Counsel instructed by Morgan Has
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Adio promulgated on 2 January 2019 allowing the  appeal  of  Ms  Gurbet
    Hamawandi against a decision of the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department dated 2 November 2017 to  refuse  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on the basis of family life with her partner.

2.   Although before me the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  is
    the Appellant and Ms Hamawandi  is  the  Respondent  for  the  sake  of
    consistency with the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall
    hereafter refer to the Secretary of State  as  the  Respondent  and  Ms
    Hamawandi as the Appellant.

3.   The Appellant is a national of  Turkey  born  on  6  April  1976.   She
    entered the United Kingdom on 23 August 2013 with entry clearance as  a
    spouse to join her British citizen husband Mr  Ribwar  Hamawandi.   Her
    leave was valid until 15 May 2016.

4.   The Appellant made an application for further leave to  remain  as  the
    spouse of a British citizen on 6 May 2016.  The application was refused
    for reasons set out in a 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated  2
    November 2017.

5.    The  application  was  refused  with  particular  reference   to   the
    'suitability' requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, and
    in particular paragraph S-LTR.1.6.  The relevant part of the  Rules  is
    in the following terms:

         "S-LTR.1.1. The applicant will be refused limited leave  to  remain
         on the grounds of suitability if any of paragraphs S-LTR.1.2 to 1.8
         apply ...

         ...

         S-LTR 1.6. The presence of the applicant in the UK is not conducive
         to the public good because  their  conduct  (including  convictions
         which do not fall within paragraphs S-LTR.1.3 to  1.5),  character,
         associations, or other reasons, make it undesirable to  allow  them
         to remain in the UK."

6.   In this context the RFRL offered the following explanation for  finding
    the Appellant did not meet the suitability requirements.

         "Suitability

         Under  paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1(d)(i),  your  application  falls   for
         refusal on grounds of suitability under Section S-LTR  because  you
         were convicted  at  Southwark  Crown  Court  on  8  March  2017  of
         Facilitate the acquisition / acquire /  possess  criminal  property
         and Conceal  /  Disguise  /  convert  /  transfer  remove  criminal
         property.  You therefore fall for refusal under  Section  S-LTR.1.6
         of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules."

7.   The RFRL otherwise indicated that  the  Respondent  accepted  that  the
    Appellant met the 'eligibility' requirements of the Rules. It was noted
    there was no requirement to consider EX.1 because the Appellant  failed
    under 'suitability'.  The Appellant's case was also considered to  fail
    in respect  of  private  life  pursuant  to  paragraph  276ADE(1)  with
    reference to 'suitability'.

8.   There is no express reference in the RFRL - or indeed in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal - to  the  particulars  of  the  Appellant's
    criminal convictions. Nonetheless the particulars are apparent  in  the
    materials before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  filed  by  the  Appellant,
    including Counsel's note on sentence and a pre-sentence report prepared
    by the National Probation Service.  In  short:  a  substantial  sum  of
    money had been placed in the  Appellant's  account  and  she  had  made
    personal  use  of  a  small  proportion  of  it;  the  total  sum   was
    approximately �1.8 million, which Mr Walsh tells me was the proceeds of
    a fraud; there is no suggestion that the Appellant was herself directly
    involved in the fraud, albeit the proceeds found  their  way  into  her
    account for a period of time;  Counsel's  note  on  sentence  indicates
    approximately �119,000 of the total was  spent  -  the  majority  being
    spent by the Appellant's husband,  and  approximately  �10,000  by  the
    Appellant.

9.    The  Appellant  received  a   suspended   sentence:   24   months   of
    imprisonment, suspended  for  24  months;  she  was  also  required  to
    undertake 200 hours of unpaid work.  In contrast her husband received a
    sentence of 33 months  imprisonment,  not  suspended.   Mr  Hamawandi's
    conviction is not referenced by the Respondent in the RFRL in  relation
    to the issue of suitability.  It is only mentioned in  the  context  of
    the residual consideration of 'exceptional circumstances', and  appears
    to be done so only in relation to the extent to which the Appellant was
    in direct contact with her husband given that he  was  in  prison.   In
    this context the RFRL states:

         "Your partner was convicted of the same offences  as  you  and  was
         sentenced to 33 months imprisonment.  Your direct contact with  him
         is limited in comparison with a couple who are cohabiting.   It  is
         considered you can  maintain  contact  with  your  partner  through
         letters, phone calls and modern means  of  communication.   On  his
         release it is open to him to join you in Turkey.  In the  meantime,
         any interference with your family life is considered  proportionate
         in the interest of the legitimate aim of crime prevention."

10.  The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

11.  The Appellant's appeal was allowed for reasons set out in the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio promulgated on 2 January 2019.

12.  The Respondent sought permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    This was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  on  22  January
    2019.

13.  The Appellant has filed a Rule 24 response under cover of letter  dated
    15 February 2019 resisting the Respondent's challenge.

14.  Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  it  was  argued  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant  that  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  on  the  issue  of
    suitability did not demonstrate that a factual judgment had been  made;
    further or alternatively the decision was not adequately explained.  It
    was identified that the RFRL went from  a  statement  of  the  fact  of
    conviction immediately to a  statement  that  the  requirements  of  S-
    LTR.1.6 were satisfied; nothing more was offered by way of  reasons  or
    explanation.

15.  The Appellant otherwise argued before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    that a different evaluation should have been made within the parameters
    of S-LTR.1.6.  In this regard the Appellant's Skeleton Argument  before
    the First-tier Tribunal (drafted by Mr Walsh) refers at paragraph 11 to
    S-LTR.1.6 requiring "a factual judgment about whether the  presence  of
    that individual is not conducive  to  the  public  good  because  their
    conduct makes  it  undesirable  for  them  to  remain".   The  Skeleton
    Argument  further  submits  "that  this  is  a  discretionary  judgment
    requiring careful and reasoned analysis of  facts  and  the  individual
    components in the wording of the Rule" (paragraph  12);  see  similarly
    "the discretionary basis of the judgment" (paragraph 13).

16.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge, having rehearsed the background  to  the
    case (including identifying the substance of the Respondent's decision)
    and the documentation that was before him, having directed  himself  to
    the law, and having noted the evidence  and  submissions  heard  before
    him, turned to a consideration of the Article 8  appeal  in  the  first
    instance by  reference  to  the  Immigration  Rules:  see  for  example
    paragraph 14, wherein the relevant Rules in respect of suitability were
    also identified.

17.  The Decision then states:

         "15. The Appellant  has  served  her  sentence  and  has  not  done
             anything  to  trigger  going   to   prison.    There   is   no
             consideration in the letter of the Respondent that  there  has
             been a factual judgment about  whether  the  presence  of  the
             Appellant is not conducive to  the  public  good  due  to  her
             conduct.  The Appellant was given a suspended sentence and she
             has served her 100 hours, but the sentence report  shows  that
             there is a low risk of reconviction and  reoffending.   It  is
             also noted that there is no significant or current  indicators
             of risk or serious harm to any  known  person.   There  is  no
             indication that the Respondent gave sufficient  reasons  given
             the discretionary basis of the judgment and  how  serious  its
             consequences were for the person affected  by  it.   There  is
             therefore not a fair assessment of the  circumstances  of  the
             Appellant before judging that her presence in the  UK  is  not
             conducive to the public good or that it is undesirable for her
             to remain in the  UK.   I  bear  in  mind  that  although  she
             committed a serious offence, the offence was not one for which
             she was sent to prison.

         16.  She has since taken on a job and is working, her P60  and  pay
             slips are included  in  the  bundle.   The  Appellant  in  her
             witness statement of 9 April 2018 states that  she  has  taken
             all necessary steps to ensure that she was  not  committing  a
             crime and that this is the first crime she has ever  committed
             and that this would be the last.   I  accept  the  submissions
             made by Mr Walsh in his skeleton argument concerning the  lack
             of discretionary judgment applied by the  Respondent  in  this
             case to the suitability requirement.  Conviction did not  meet
             the threshold for deportation.   The  Appellant's  culpability
             was quite clear, though not as much as her husband.   However,
             I find that the Appellant is not someone who the public  needs
             to be protected from.  She has gone on to get  a  job  and  is
             contributing to the economy  of  the  UK.   I  find  that  her
             presence in the UK is conducive to the public good despite her
             conduct.  I also find  that  although  she  has  committed  an
             offence her risk of reconviction or  reoffending  is  low  and
             taking all the circumstances into account her  character  does
             not make it undesirable to allow her to remain in the  UK.   I
             therefore find that the Respondent did not exercise discretion
             properly  in  refusing  the  Appellant  under  S-LTR.1.6.    I
             therefore find that the Appellant does not  fall  for  refusal
             under the paragraph of the Rules."

18.  Thereafter the Judge went on to consider EX.1(b)  of  Appendix  FM  and
    ultimately reached a conclusion in the following terms.

         "On the totality of evidence  before  me  I  find  that  there  are
         insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in  Turkey,  and
         this will not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for
         the applicant and her partner." (paragraph 17).

19.   I  pause  to  note  that  this  latter  finding  -   in   respect   of
    'insurmountable obstacles' - is not the subject of express challenge in
    the Respondent's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

20.  It may be seen that the First-tier Tribunal Judge addressed  the  issue
    of 'suitability',  accepted  the  submission  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant  that  the  Respondent  had  not  adequately  explained   the
    conclusion that S-LTR.1.6 was satisfied; and in any event made his  own
    evaluation of the facts and  circumstances  of  the  case  against  the
    framework of S-LTR.1.6 concluded that its  terms  were  not  satisfied.
    Having thus found that the Appellant's application should not have been
    refused under the Rules by reference to 'suitability', the  Judge  went
    on to consider  the  residual  aspect  of  the  Rules  with  particular
    reference to EX.1, and found in the  Appellant's  favour.   Accordingly
    the Judge was satisfied that the Appellant met the requirements of  the
    Rules - which are drafted to reflect a proportionate respect for family
    life - and concluded that the appeal succeeded on Article 8 grounds.

21.  Be that as it may,  the  Judge  also  made  an  alternative  favourable
    finding:

         "Even if I had found that the Respondent was  right  to  refuse  on
         grounds of suitability, for  the  same  reasons  given  above  with
         regards to the issue of the couple trying for a baby as well as the
         political writings of the Appellant's spouse, I  would  have  found
         the Respondent's decision to be disproportionate." (paragraph 17)

22.  The Respondent's grounds of challenge have their primary focus  on  the
    Judge's consideration of the Immigration Rule  on  'suitability'.   The
    principal submission is that the Judge has misunderstood that the  Rule
    is mandatory in nature, and has erroneously referred to there  being  a
    discretion under the Rule.

23.  In my judgement this principal basis of challenge is misconceived.

24.  It  cannot  be  disputed  that  if  the  conditions  of  S-LTR.1.6  are
    satisfied then the refusal  under  the  Rules  is  mandatory:  see  the
    wording at S-LTR.1.1 "the applicant will be refused".  This  is  not  a
    Rule where if S-LTR.1.6 is satisfied there is under the Rules at  large
    a discretion nonetheless to allow or refuse  the  application.   It  is
    evident that this mandatory element of the Rule is  the  focus  of  the
    ground of challenge. In substance it is pleaded that the  Judge  failed
    to recognise this.

25.  The mandatory element of the Rule - 'will be refused' - is  necessarily
    premised on the conditions or requirement of the Rule being  satisfied.
    Inherent in paragraph S-LTR.1.6 is an evaluative process; the condition
    therein - "presence... is not conducive to the public good"  -  is  not
    automatically or mandatorily met by reference to any particular conduct
    or association, or character  feature,  or  other  invoked  reason;  an
    evaluative judgement is required as to whether such  factors  "make  it
    undesirable to allow [the applicant] to remain".

26.  The  references  to  'discretion'  employed  both  in  the  Appellant's
    Skeleton Argument and in the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  are
    references to this evaluative  judgement  inherent  in  S-LTR.1.6.  The
    references to 'discretion' are  not  an  indication  that  it  was  the
    Appellant's case, or more particularly the Judge's understanding,  that
    the Rule was a 'discretionary' rule rather than a mandatory rule.

27.  I can understand how the confusion  has  arises  in  the  mind  of  the
    drafter of the Respondent's grounds pursuant to the  use  of  the  word
    'discretionary' in the context of a 'discretionary  judgment'  in  both
    the Appellant's Skeleton  Argument  (paragraphs  12  and  13)  and  the
    Decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (paragraph   15),   and   most
    particularly  pursuant  to  the  Judge's  phrase  "did   not   exercise
    discretion  properly  in  refusing  the  Appellant  under   S-LTR.1.6."
    (paragraph 16).  It seems to me that to avoid such confusion  it  would
    have been better to identify that the judgment within the framework  of
    S-LTR.1.6 is essentially an evaluative judgment in which the  decision-
    maker brings to bear their individual judgment.

28.  I do not accept that the use by the Judge of the  word  'discretionary'
    in this context demonstrates that he misunderstood the  nature  of  the
    Rules in respect of 'suitability'.  Indeed far from it.  It seems to me
    that the Judge identified that there was a deficiency of  reasoning  in
    the Respondent's own evaluation of factors potentially relevant  to  S-
    LTR.1.6, and in any event appropriately embarked  upon  an  independent
    evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the case. In this  context
    the Judge  has  adequately  identified  and  explained  the  facts  and
    circumstances of the case, and how they informed his evaluation of  the
    issue of whether it  was  "undesirable  to  allow  [the  Appellant]  to
    remain" pursuant to paragraph S-LTR.1.6.

29.  The  Judge's  evaluation  under  S-LTR  1.6  is  also  the  subject  of
    criticism in the grounds of appeal, with particular reference  to:  the
    Judge's comment that the "Conviction did not meeting the threshold  for
    deportation" (paragraph  16);  the  Appellant's  association  with  her
    husband; and the wider public interest -  including  public  revulsion,
    deterrence, and confidence in an effective immigration system.

30.  I am not persuaded that the Judge was in  error  in  stating  that  the
    Appellant's conviction did not  meet  the  threshold  for  deportation.
    Necessarily where a conviction is being considered in the context of S-
    LTR.1.6 it will be one that does not  fall  within  the  threshold  for
    deportation. It seems to me that it cannot be inferred from the  simple
    and accurate statement of  fact  -  "Conviction  did  not  meeting  the
    threshold for deportation" - that the Judge overlooked  that  that  was
    inevitable in the context of S-LTR.1.6, or that he  otherwise  accorded
    it conclusive weight. It is clear the Judge went on to  consider  other
    factors. In the overall context of considering suitability  it  is  not
    irrelevant to make such an observation on the nature  of  the  criminal
    conduct.

31.  As regards the reference in the Respondent's grounds to  'association',
    I note that this was not a matter raised in the RFRL in the context  of
    S-LTR.1.6, or otherwise in the context  of  'suitability'.  As  I  have
    identified above, the conduct  of  the  Appellant's  husband  was  only
    raised in the context of  his  imprisonment  reducing  the  quality  of
    shared family life.

32.  Similarly, the Respondent did not make any  express  reference  in  the
    RFRL to the notions of revulsion and deterrence.

33.  In all such circumstances I do  accept  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  can  be  criticised  for  not  having  made  any  particularised
    reference to the Appellant's association with her husband as an  aspect
    of conduct to be considered under S-LTR.1.6., or for  not  having  made
    any particularised reference to public revulsion and/or deterrence.

34.  Mr Avery also submitted  that  the  Judge  erred  when  considering  S-
    LTR.1.6 in having regard to the impact of removal on the Appellant.  He
    argued that the focus is on the public interest, not the effect on  the
    applicant. As such, the Judge's observation - "There is  no  indication
    that the Respondent gave sufficient  reasons  given  the  discretionary
    basis of the judgment and how serious its  consequences  were  for  the
    person affected by it" (paragraph 15) - was in error.

35.  Even if the premise of Mr Avery's submission is sound, I do not  accept
    that the quoted reference was made by the Judge in the context  of  his
    evaluation of  S-LTR.1.6.  It  seems  to  me  plain  that  the  Judge's
    observation was made in the context of considering the adequacy of  the
    Respondent's reasons  in  the  RFRL:  the  Judge  was  saying  that  in
    circumstances where a decision that S-LTR.1.6 was  engaged  would  have
    serious consequences, the duty adequately to explain  the  reasons  for
    such a decision was that much greater than might be the case  otherwise
    - and this was also appropriate given  that  there  was  an  evaluative
    element.

36.  Mr Avery also suggested that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  should  not
    have accorded any weight to the fact that  the  Appellant  was  now  in
    employment.  I disagree.  It seems  to  me  that  that  is  a  relevant
    consideration in evaluating whether the Appellant's conduct is such  as
    to make it undesirable that she be allowed  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  It is part of the overall picture of her conduct, and part of
    an evaluation of the desirability or otherwise of her remaining in  the
    United  Kingdom.  The  extent  to  which   an   individual   may   have
    rehabilitated herself subsequent to  undesirable  conduct  is  part  of
    considering whether it is undesirable to allow her to remain.

37.  Ultimately it seems to me that Mr Avery was driven to  argue  that  the
    mere  fact  of  the  Appellant's  convictions   was   itself   adequate
    justification for the engagement of S-LTR.1.6.  It seems  to  me  clear
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge took a different  view  for  reasons
    adequately explained.  To that extent ultimately the Respondent's  case
    was one of disagreement with the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

38.  In all of the circumstances I can identify no error of law.
