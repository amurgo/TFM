For the Respondent:    Ms G Davison, Counsel, Direct Access

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant is the Secretary  of  State  and  the  respondent  is  Mr
    Salnikov.  However for the purposes of  this  decision  and  reasons  I
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal  where
    the appellant was Mr Salnikov who is a citizen of Ukraine born 3  March
    1986 who applied to the respondent on 16 October  2016  for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis of long residency.  In a decision dated  5
    April 2018 the Secretary of  State  refused  that  application.   In  a
    decision promulgated on  18  October  2018,  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Mitchell  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.

 2. The background to this  case,  in  summary,  is  that  the  appellant's
    application was refused under paragraph 276B(iii) and under  paragraphs
    322(5) on the basis that when the appellant  made  an  application  for
    leave on 12 October 2010 as a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  he  claimed
    earnings of �42,406 derived from self-employment between 12 August 2009
    and 10 August 2010.  He made a further application on 15  October  2012
    declaring previous earnings of  �45,611  derived  from  self-employment
    between 16 August 2011 and 15 September 2012.  On both applications  he
    was awarded 25 points  in  relation  to  the  previous  employment  and
    earnings.   However  the  Secretary  of  State   confirmed   that   the
    appellant's income for tax year ending April 2010 was �13,633, for  the
    tax year April 2011 was �5,930, for the tax year ending April 2012  was
    �12,422.  (A previous decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside
    and remitted by that Tribunal on  24  August  2018  as  the  Notice  of
    Hearing was not received by the appellant.)

 3. The respondent relied on paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    which provides as follows:

         "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to  remain
         to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  should  normally  be
         refused:

         (v)  the undesirability  of  permitting  the  person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security; ...".

 4. The judge in his findings accepted that the appellant had not  provided
    incorrect information to the Secretary of State or attempted to deceive
    in any of his applications.  The judge went on to consider  the  appeal
    under Article 8 and considered the public interest  considerations  but
    was satisfied that the appeal fell to be allowed.

 5. The appellant appeals with permission on the  grounds  that  the  judge
    made a material misdirection  of  law  in  finding  that  the  earnings
    figures used by the appellant in his  applications  for  Tier  1  leave
    could take into account the tax deductible expenses of the  appellant's
    business.  It was argued that this was an incorrect  interpretation  of
    the Immigration Rules where paragraph 25 of Appendix A provides:

             "Where the earnings are the  profits  of  a  business  derived
             through self-employment or other business activities:

                   a) the earnings that will be assessed are the profits of
                      the business before tax.  Where the applicant owns  a
                      share of the  business  the  earnings  that  will  be
                      assessed are the profits of the business  before  tax
                      to which the applicant is entitled."

 6. It was the Secretary of State's contention  that  the  judge  erred  in
    finding that the figures provided by the appellant to the  Home  Office
    for the purposes of immigration  applications  and  to  HMRC  were  not
    discrepant.   It  was  asserted  that  the  income  declared  for   his
    immigration application should have been the same  income  declared  to
    HMRC and that both should be net  profit  before  tax  from  the  self-
    employment, after deducting business expenses.

Error of Law Discussion

 7. Ms Kenny on behalf of the Secretary of State  adopted  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  It was  her  submission  that  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in not following  the  correct  procedure  including  as
    highlighted in R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))  [2018]
    UKUT 00384 (IAC).  This provides guidance including as follows:

      i) Where there has been a significant difference  between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  Such an inference could be expected where there
         is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.

     ii) Where an applicant has presented evidence to show that, despite the
         prime facie inference, he  was  not  in  fact  dishonest  but  only
         careless, then the Secretary  of  State  must  decide  whether  the
         explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace
         the prime facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.

    iii) In approaching that  fact-finding  task,  the  Secretary  of  State
         should remind herself that, although the standard of proof  is  the
         "balance  of  probability",  a  finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.

     iv) For applicants simply to blame his or her accountant for an "error"
         in relation to the historical tax return will not be the end of the
         matter, given that the accountant will or  should  have  asked  the
         taxpayer to confirm that the return was accurate and to have signed
         the tax return.  Furthermore the applicant will have known  of  his
         or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.  If  the
         applicant does not take steps within a reasonable  time  to  remedy
         the situation, the Secretary of State may be entitled  to  conclude
         that this failure justifies a conclusion that there has been deceit
         of dishonesty.

      v) When considering whether or not the applicant is dishonest or maybe
         careless the Secretary  of  State  should  consider  the  following
         matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to which their  evidence
         (as opposed to asserted):

         (i)  whether the explanation for the error by their  accountant  is
             plausible;

         (ii) whether the documentation which can  be  soon  to  exist  (for
             example  correspondence  between   the   applicant   and   his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for what is missing;

         (iii)    why the applicant did not realise that an error  had  been
             made because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should
             have expected;

         (iv) whether at any stage the applicant has taken steps  to  remedy
             the situation and if so when those steps were  taken  and  the
             explanation for any significant delay."

 8. However, this was not a case, like the paradigm case discussed in Khan,
    where an applicant had disclosed a high income to the Home  Office  and
    then subsequently made lower tax returns.  It is the  appellant's  case
    all along that his applications for leave contained his gross  earnings
    whereas the HMRC figures were net of his expenses.

 9. Although Ms Kenny submitted that the judge erred in not  following  the
    steps in Khan and in not  finding  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    entitled to draw  an  inference  of  dishonesty  and  then  considering
    whether there was an innocent explanation, as noted at (i) of the  head
    note of Khan the Secretary of State is entitled to  draw  an  inference
    "where there is no plausible explanation  for  the  discrepancy".   The
    judge in the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  satisfied  that  there  was  a
    plausible explanation for  the  discrepancy  in  income,  in  that  the
    appellant has  always  maintained,  and  the  judge  accepted  for  the
    adequate reasons given, that he had extensive expenses.

10. The judge found at [19] including as follows:

         "The appellant in his applications for the Tier 1  leave  contained
         the gross earnings whereas figures given to the respondent by  HMRC
         are net.  The appellant has had extensive  expenses.   Although  it
         requires a degree of application the  appellant's  account  of  his
         income and the figures revealed to the  respondent  from  HMRC  are
         largely congruent.  The earnings of the appellant seem  to  be  the
         profits of the business before tax.   He  is  registered  as  self-
         employed and seems  to  have  appropriately  provided  the  correct
         figures to the Secretary of State as  he  has  provided  the  gross
         figure rather than the net figure.  There is no evidence  that  the
         appellant has acted dishonestly or deceitfully to the Secretary  of
         State.  ...".

11. The judge went on to find that he was satisfied that the appellant  had
    not provided  incorrect  information  to  the  Secretary  of  State  or
    attempted to deceive in any of his applications.

12. Although not specifically pursued by Ms Kenny, the  grounds  of  appeal
    were preoccupied largely  with  the  interpretation  of  what  earnings
    should be assessed by the Home Office in applications.  As relied on in
    the Secretary of State's grounds, these are assessed as the profits  of
    the business before tax.   The  Application  to  set  aside/grounds  of
    appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  (which  was  in  effect  Counsel's
    arguments before the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal)  considered  the
    guidance on Tier 1 applications which includes as follows:

         "Assessment of previous earnings

         91.  We  will  assess  your  earnings.   If  you  are  in  salaried
             employment (including a director of a company for example)  we
             will assess your gross salary before tax.  This also  includes
             self-employed  applicants  who  draw  a  salary   from   their
             business.  If you earned the money in a country  with  no  tax
             system, we will consider your total earnings for the period.

         92.  If you are self-employed and have chosen to retain the profits
             within the business your earnings were limited to the share of
             the business's net profits to which  you  are  entitled.   The
             appropriate proportion of the net profit of the business (that
             is after tax and outgoings) can therefore be counted  as  your
             gross salary.  We will only consider profits made  during  the
             appropriate twelve month earnings period  for  which  you  are
             claiming."

13.  The judge also had before him Appendix  Z  to  the  Immigration  Rules
    which considers the  attributes  for  Tier  1  Migrants.   This  states
    including as follows:

         "24. Where the earnings take the form of a salary  or  wages,  they
             will be assessed before tax (i.e. gross salary).

         25.  Where the earnings  or  the  profits  of  a  business  derived
             through self-employment or other business activities:

             (a)  the earnings that will be assessed are the profits of the
                  business before tax.  Where the applicant only has a share
                  of the business, the earnings  will  be  assessed  on  the
                  profits of the business before tax to which the  applicant
                  is entitled, and

             (b)  the applicant must be registered as self-employed in  the
                  UK and must provide the specified evidence.

             ...".

14. It was the applicant's case before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  which
    was accepted by the judge that  the  appellant  believed  "before  tax"
    referred to a gross figure and therefore the appellant provided a gross
    figure.  The Secretary of State has not specifically disputed that  the
    appellant's business had  made  the  actual  gross  profit  figures  he
    claimed, rather it is the appellant's  claimed  interpretation  of  the
    immigration rules which the Secretary of State claimed to be dishonest.

15. Although the Secretary of State's grounds rely on the  judicial  review
    case R (Varghasa) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]
    JR/5167/2016  which  the  authors  of  permission  for  grounds  stated
    rejected the argument that gross self-employed income could  be  relied
    on, the extract did not support that argument and, as  accepted  by  Ms
    Kenny, there was nothing further before me that might  support  such  a
    conclusion.

16. Even if I am  wrong  and  the  judge  should  have  accepted  that  the
    Secretary of  State  had  established  a  prime  facie  case  that  the
    appellant had been  deceitful  (which  I  am  satisfied  has  not  been
    established) and should have considered whether  there  was  an  honest
    explanation, the judge was clearly of the view that the  appellant  had
    provided a plausible explanation for  any  discrepancy.   It  is  plain
    therefore that any such error would  not  be  material  as  the  judge,
    having reviewed the  evidence  before  him  including  the  appellant's
    account of his income and the figures provided to  HMRC  together  with
    the statements in support (including from his auditors and accountants)
    accepted the appellant's explanation that he  believed  that  he  could
    submit gross profit, before the deduction of expenses, as innocent.   I
    am not satisfied that there  is  any  material  error  in  the  judge's
    decision in  effect  that,  at  worst,  the  appellant  had  innocently
    confused what was gross and net income, in terms of  the  deduction  of
    expenses, for the purposes of his application.

17.  Even  if  the  appellant  was  not  permitted,  in   his   immigration
    applications, to submit the gross profits of the  business  before  the
    deductions of expenses, the judge was entitled to find for the adequate
    reasons he gave, which could not be said to be irrational,  that  there
    was no dishonesty in the appellant's approach.

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an  error  of
    law and shall stand.

    No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
