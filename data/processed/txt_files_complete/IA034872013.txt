                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:       Mr M McSherry, Solicitor Advocate
For the Respondent:      Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellant appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Scobbie, promulgated  on  15  April  2013,  dismissing  her  appeal
   against refusal of extension of leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  (General)
   Student Migrant.

2) Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on  the  view  the
   judge might have failed properly to consider an  issue  of  fairness.   A
   change in the Immigration Rules caused the appellant to be  caught  by  a
   provision against studies below degree level being carried  on  for  more
   than 3 years.

3) Mr McSherry said that the appellant arrived in the  UK  on  14  September
   2009 and had leave as a student until 2012.  Her proposed course  led  to
   an HND (Higher National Diploma) but on arrival at Motherwell College  it
   transpired that there was no access course,  and  she  therefore  had  to
   enrol initially for an HNC (Higher National  Certificate).   She  applied
   for an extension of leave on 5 October 2012,  which  was  refused  on  18
   January 2013.  She alleged unfairness, not through  the  absence  of  the
   access  course,  but  because  of  the  respondent's  failure   to   make
   transitional provisions.  The Rules changed against her in a way of which
   she could have had no foreknowledge.  She had acted on  advice  from  the
   college.  She has spent ï¿½15,500 on course fees.  Her leave  was  extended
   during the appeal process under section 3C of the 1971 Act, and  she  has
   completed her HND.  Her graduation is due to take  place  on  23  October
   2013.  She wishes to attend her graduation and intends then to return  to
   Nepal.

4)  Mr  Mullen  argued  that  the  fact  that  the  Rules  changed   without
   transitional provisions did not expose  an  issue  of  fairness,  on  the
   authority of Adelola v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25.

5) I raised the question whether the appellant's case  ought  to  have  been
   considered in terms of Article 8 of the ECHR, on the basis of her private
   life interest in completing her studies.  Mr Mullen submitted that  there
   was no such ground of appeal either to the First-tier Tribunal or to  the
   Upper Tribunal, and that there  was  in  any  event  no  disproportionate
   interference.

6) I indicated that the appeal would be  allowed  under  Article  8  of  the
   ECHR.

7) The argument based on fairness is not a good one,  on  the  authority  of
   Adelola.  However, the same circumstances are relevant to  Article  8  of
   ECHR.  It is incumbent upon the Secretary of State and upon Tribunals  to
   ensure that all decisions are compliant with Article 8.

8) It was common ground that leave granted to a student is usually for  such
   a period as to complete the formalities of the course and to  attend  for
   personal graduation.

9) The appellant plainly had a  private  life  interest  in  completing  her
   course.  Her conduct is not to be criticised in any way.  There is always
   some public interest in enforcing the Rules as they stand, but there  was
   no significant interest in insisting upon their strict  terms  so  as  to
   prevent the appellant from completing her course.  Now that she has  done
   so, there is no significant interest in insisting upon  her  leaving  the
   country prior to attending her graduation.  Of  course,  this  is  not  a
   question of preventing an interference which goes to  the  essence  of  a
   fundamental human right; but the public interest side of the  balance  is
   even lighter.

10) In those particular  circumstances,  it  would  be  disproportionate  to
   insist upon the appellant leaving the  country  prior  to  attending  her
   graduation ceremony.

11) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.   The  appeal
   is allowed to the extent that the appellant  should  be  granted  further
   leave to enable her to attend her graduation before  she  leaves  the  UK
   (until, say, the end of October 2013).

12) No anonymity order has been requested or made.
