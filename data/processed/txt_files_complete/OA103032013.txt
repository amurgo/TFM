                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Malik - Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker - Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lobo issued on  3rd  March  2014  allowing
    under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds the Appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Respondent made on 15th  April  2013
    to refuse entry clearance  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. On 26th March 2014 a First-tier Tribunal Judge  granted  permission  to
    appeal.  She said:

         "2.  The grounds of application assert that the First-tier Tribunal
             Judge  made  arguable  material  errors  of  law  by   firstly
             accepting insufficient evidence from the  Appellant's  Sponsor
             to demonstrate that he was in receipt of an income of at least
             �18,600 per year and secondly by allowing the appeal under the
             provisions of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human
             Rights  outside  the  Immigration   Rules.    The   Respondent
             maintains that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had not  set  out
             any  reasons  for  finding   that   there   were   'compelling
             circumstances' that  would  engage  Article  8  and  that  the
             approach to Article 8 was erroneous.

         3.   I have considered the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  findings
             with regard to the Sponsor's income and note that at paragraph
             8 of the determination the First-tier Tribunal Judge  recorded
             that in order to meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
             Rules  the  applicant  must  provide  specified  evidence   to
             demonstrate a gross annual income of  at  least  �18,600.   At
             paragraph 27(c) the First-tier Tribunal Judge recorded that -

                  'The Appellant had provided  evidence  that  the  Sponsor
                  enjoyed two employments, namely with Rodmatic Ltd and with
                  Spice Gardens.  In relation to the specified documents the
                  Appellant had provided them in respect of Rodmatic but not
                  in respect of Spice Gardens.'

              Then at paragraph 31(e) the First-tier Tribunal Judge recorded
             that -

                  'The Appellant in her application provided evidence in the
                  form of a P60 from the Sponsor that  the  Sponsor  in  the
                  year ending April 2012 received an income from Rodmatic of
                  �18,907.60.'

         4.   I am therefore satisfied that it is not simply the  case  that
             the Sponsor produced a P60 as the  only  form  of  documentary
             evidence with regard to his employment - he  also  produced  a
             series of payslips together with a copy of a letter  from  his
             employers.

         5.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that it was not  necessary
             for him to go on to consider the  income  from  the  Sponsor's
             secondary source of employment because he was satisfied  based
             upon the evidence of the P60 that he earned over  �18,600  per
             annum from that source.

         6.   I find that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  may  have  made  a
             material error of law in that regard because the  payslips  do
             not demonstrate that the Sponsor was earning as  much  as  the
             P60 has recorded and the letter from his employer states  that
             he is earning �7 an hour and working 36  hours  a  week  which
             equates to �13,104 per annum.  I am  satisfied  that  this  is
             indicative of an error of fact which may have led  the  First-
             tier Tribunal Judge to make  an  unsustainable  finding  based
             upon the evidence and accordingly I find  that  permission  to
             appeal should be granted."

 3. At the hearing before me Mr Walker conceded that on  the  evidence  the
    Appellant does earn over �18,600 gross per annum.  The Judge  only  had
    payslips before him.

 4. The P60 from Rodmatic Ltd for the year to 5th April 2012 shows a  gross
    income of �18,907.60.  There was also  confirmation  of  his  job  with
    Manrose Quality Ventilation with a gross annual  salary  of  �10,876.32
    and there  are payslips for that job.

 5. Having taken account of the submissions of both representatives I  find
    that there is no material error of law  in  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal with  regard  to  the  grant  of  leave  under  the
    Immigration Rules and I uphold that decision.  For completeness I  note
    that Judge Lobo allowed the appeal on human rights grounds on the basis
    that on the assumption that the  Immigration  Rules  are  human  rights
    compliant it follows that the  appeal  should  also  succeed  on  human
    rights grounds even though the Appellant would not  have  succeeded  on
    Article 8 grounds under the Immigration Rules.  This seems to me to  be
    incorrect.

Decision

The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed and the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
