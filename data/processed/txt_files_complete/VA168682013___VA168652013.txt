                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This  is  the  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes promulgated  29.7.14,
    allowing the claimants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as
    family visitors.  The Judge heard the appeal on 16.7.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.9.14 but when the application was renewed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic granted permission to appeal on 5.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 22.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Landes should be set aside.

 5. The relevant background can be summarised  as  follows.  The  claimants
    applied for entry clearance as family visitors pursuant to paragraph 41
    of the Immigration Rules, for a period of 2 months. The application was
    refused on 9.7.13. In  addition  to  concerns  relating  the  financial
    circumstances of the sponsor, leading the Entry Clearance Officer to be
    not satisfied that the application was genuine and  that  the  claimant
    intended only a short visit to the UK, the application was  refused  on
    the basis of 320(7B), because deception had been  used  in  a  previous
    application in 2009, when a false property inspection report  had  been
    submitted and the claimants had signed the application  form  declaring
    that all information submitted was correct.

 6. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal asserted, as the judge
    in due course found, that neither claimant nor the  sponsor  knew  that
    the property report submitted in 2009 was false. The elderly  claimants
    were illiterate.

 7. The narrow issue the subject of the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is the
    interpretation of paragraph 3207B of the Immigration Rules and  whether
    reference therein to the "applicant" means the applicant personally, or
    whether it incorporates the use of deception by another, or without the
    applicant's knowledge, as is the case in paragraph 3207A.

 8. At �21 Judge Landes acknowledged that in AA (Nigeria) [2010]  EWCA  Civ
    773, the Court of Appeal held that deception in 320(7B) had to  involve
    dishonesty. But drawing a distinction between the wording  of  320(7A),
    which makes it clear that the applicant's knowledge is irrelevant,  and
    320(7B), which does not so specify, the judge considered  that  320(7B)
    required the claimant to have been personally dishonest. The judge also
    relied on Ozoghina and Tarasova [2011] UKUT 00197 (IAC), which  pointed
    out the  potentially  draconian  consequences  of  the  application  of
    paragraph 320(7B) and held that the applicant must be show to have made
    the false statement with the deliberate intent of securing an advantage
    in immigration terms.

 9. Judge Landes did not accept the sponsor's claim of innocence in the use
    of a false document and noted that Judge Hollingworth was sceptical  as
    to  the  sponsor's  involvement  in  the  production   of   the   false
    accommodation report. However, at �27 she found that the  fact  that  a
    family member may have been dishonest does not mean that the  claimants
    acted dishonestly, the burden of showing that they did lying  with  the
    Entry Clearance Officer. The judge was not satisfied that the claimants
    deliberately produced a false property  report  in  order  to  gain  an
    immigration advantage. The judge was not satisfied that the application
    should have been refused under 320(7B) and went on to also find in  the
    claimants' favour on the remaining issues under paragraph 41, and  thus
    allowed the appeals.

10. Judge Kekic granted permission to appeal, finding it arguable that  the
    judge had misdirected herself in that her approach to paragraph 320(7A)
    contradicts AA (Nigeria).

11. Paragraph 320(7A) provides for mandatory  refusal  of  an  application,
    "where false representations have  been  made  or  false  documents  or
    information have  been  submitted  (whether  or  not  material  to  the
    application, and whether or  not  to  the  applicant's  knowledge),  or
    material facts have not been disclosed, in relation to the  application
    or in order to obtain documents from the Secretary of State or a  third
    party required in support of the application."

12. Paragraph 320(7B) provides for mandatory  refusal  of  an  application,
    "where the applicant has previously breached the UK's immigration  laws
    (and was 18 or over at the time of his most recent breach) by: ...  (d)
    "using deception in an application for entry clearance, leave to  enter
    or remain, or in order to obtain documents from the Secretary of  State
    or a third party  required  in  support  of  the  application  (whether
    successful or not);  unless..." None of the unless exceptions apply  to
    the facts of this case.

13. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the Entry Clearance Officer
    has failed to demonstrate that  there  is  any  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. The  interpretation  of  paragraph
    320(7B) is one which is consistent with the wording of  the  provision.
    The judge's distinction between 320(7A), which specifically states that
    it does not  matter  whether  the  applicant  is  aware  of  the  false
    statement, etc., is  also  consistent.  I  do  not  find  the  decision
    perverse or irrational.

14. The two cases, both cited by both parties in submissions to me, do  not
    directly answer the issue in the  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  In
    Ozhogina and Tarsova the Upper Tribunal  held  that  where  320(7B)  is
    relied on to refuse an application because of the use of  deception  in
    an application for entry clearance it is necessary to show that a false
    statement  was  deliberately  made  for  the  purpose  of  securing  an
    advantage in immigration terms. Deception is defined in paragraph 6  as
    "making false representations or submitting false documents (whether or
    not material to  the  application)  or  failing  to  disclose  material
    facts." The Upper Tribunal noted that  320(7b)  does  not  include  the
    phrase "whether or not  to  the  applicant's  knowledge."  At  �22  the
    Tribunal stated, "There is therefore not in 320(7B)  the  proviso  that
    deception as defined can arise whether or not the falsity,  and  indeed
    its materiality, was to the applicant's knowledge."

15. The Court of Appeal decision in AA v SSHD preceded and  was  considered
    by the Upper Tribunal in Ozhogina and Tarsova. However,  that  decision
    was addressing a slightly different issue, finding at �76 that  "false"
    requires dishonesty or deception, although not necessarily that of  the
    applicant himself. Mr McVeety relied on this in  his  submissions  that
    Judge Landes had misdirected herself in law.

16. AA was in fact considering a different, though  similar  provision,  of
    paragraph 322(1A). At �27 Lord Justice  Rix  noted  that  there  is  no
    reference to the applicant's knowledge  in  320(7B),  as  there  is  in
    320(7A). He also found that deception, as defined requires  dishonesty,
    but went on at �28  to  state  that  if  so,  "then  paragraph  320(7B)
    contains nothing to say about how an applicant who may have  previously
    breached immigration rules by making a false representation other  than
    dishonestly, for instance because the false representations were  false
    without the applicant's (or anyone's)  knowledge,  should  be  treated,
    where he falls within none of the conditions (a) to (d)  above,"  (i.e.
    of 320(7B)). These findings are, in my view, entirely  consistent  with
    the conclusion of Judge Landes that 320(7B)(d) requires,  by  the  very
    wording, the use of deception by the applicant. To  that  extent,  with
    all due respect to the Court of Appeal, the statement in  �76  referred
    to above may have been too sweeping and is misleading if interpreted to
    suggest that 320(7A)(d) can be met without the participating  knowledge
    of the applicant.

Conclusions:

17. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out herein,  I  find  that
    the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is  payable  for  responding  to  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
Tribunal and thus there can be no fee award.
