Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. T Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Ripley ('the Judge'), sent to the parties on 3 December  2020,
    by which the appellant's appeal against a decision of the respondent to
    refuse to allow him leave to remain in this  country  on  human  rights
    grounds and to maintain a deportation order was dismissed.

 2.  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Chohan  granted  the   appellant
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal by a  decision  dated  8  January
    2021.

Remote Hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Teams video conference hearing held  during
    the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing room at Field  House.
    The hearing room and the building were open to the public. The  hearing
    and its start time were listed in the cause list. I  was  addressed  by
    the representatives in the same way as  if  we  were  together  in  the
    hearing room. I am satisfied: that this constituted a hearing  in  open
    court; that the open justice principle has been secured; that no  party
    has  been  prejudiced;  and  that,  insofar  as  there  has  been   any
    restriction on a right or interest, it is justified  as  necessary  and
    proportionate.

Anonymity

 4. The Judge did not make an anonymity order and neither  party  requested
    an order before me.

 5. I note the recent observation of Elisabeth Laing  LJ  in  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v. Starkey [2021] EWCA Civ 421, at  [97]-
    [98], made in the context of  deportation  proceedings  concerned  with
    sexual offences,  that  defendants  in  criminal  proceedings  are  not
    usually anonymised. Both the First-tier Tribunal and this Tribunal  are
    to be mindful of such fact. I am satisfied that the appellant  in  this
    matter has already been  subject  to  the  open  justice  principle  in
    respect of his criminal conviction, which is a matter of public  record
    and so considered to be known by the wider community. I find  that  the
    common  law  right  permitting  the  public  to  know  about   Tribunal
    proceedings in this matter, a right further  protected  by  article  10
    ECHR, outweighs the appellant's rights under article 8 ECHR. I  do  not
    make an anonymity order in this matter.

 6. The appellant has been convicted of a serious  sexual  offence.  Whilst
    there is no requirement for the victim to be named in  my  decision,  I
    take the opportunity to observe that consequent to  section  1  of  the
    Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act  1992  ('the  1992  Act')  there  is  a
    prohibition upon the reporting of any matter  which  may  lead  to  the
    identification of a complainant in respect of certain sexual  offences,
    including sexual assault on a female by penetration contrary to section
    2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003: section 2(da) of the 1992 Act.  Such
    anonymity is for life.

Background

 7. The appellant is a national of Nigeria and is  presently  aged  51.  He
    entered the United Kingdom with leave to enter  as  a  visitor  in  May
    1999. A subsequent application for further leave to remain was  refused
    by the respondent by means of a decision in March 2000.  The  appellant
    did not enjoy an attendant right of appeal.

 8. The appellant claimed asylum in March 2000,  but  the  application  was
    refused in July 2000 on non-compliance grounds. The respondent withdrew
    this decision in June  2001.  The  application  was  again  refused  in
    February 2004. The appellant's appeal was dismissed on 1 March 2005.

 9. The appellant entered into a relationship with 'JB' and their child was
    born in December 2004. At the date of the Judge's  decision  the  child
    was a few days short of their 16th birthday.

10. In the same month as his first child was born, the appellant  commenced
    residing with his first wife, 'VM'. An application for leave to  remain
    based on his marriage was received by the respondent in February  2005.
    A subsequent application for indefinite leave to remain in this country
    was submitted in September 2005. The application was initially  refused
    by the respondent in February 2006, but that decision was withdrawn  in
    January 2007.

11. Following the appellant's convictions for failing to provide a specimen
    for  analysis  (x2),  no  insurance  and  driving  otherwise  than   in
    accordance with a licence the respondent issued the  appellant  with  a
    warning letter in 2009.

12. On 28 July 2009 the respondent granted the appellant  indefinite  leave
    to remain in this country.

13. The appellant married his present wife, 'CO', in Nigeria  in  2013  and
    they have two  children.  CO  and  the  children  currently  reside  in
    Nigeria.

Previous convictions

14. The appellant was convicted in relation to  driving  offences  on  four
    occasions between 2005 and 2014 in relation  to:  driving  with  excess
    alcohol (x1); failing to provide  a  specimen  for  analysis  (x2);  no
    insurance (x1); driving otherwise than in  accordance  with  a  licence
    (x1); and  driving  whilst  disqualified  (x1).  For  all  offences  he
    received non-custodial sentences and at his last  court  appearance  in
    2014 he was disqualified from driving for a period of 46 months.


Index Offence

15. The index offence can  be  addressed  briefly.  The  Crown's  case,  as
    accepted by a jury, was that in 2010/11 the appellant returned  to  the
    victim's family home with  her  mother.  Both  the  appellant  and  the
    victim's mother had been drinking. Over time, the appellant acted in  a
    manner that concerned the victim, then aged around 14 or  15  years  of
    age, such as sitting next to her when her mother left the room, holding
    her hands and stating that he wanted to take her to Nigeria  and  marry
    her. The appellant followed the victim  upstairs  to  her  bedroom  and
    requested that he be allowed entry. The victim refused and blocked  the
    door. When the appellant and the  victim's  mother  went  to  bed,  the
    victim decided to stay downstairs for safety. She armed herself with  a
    knife. The appellant came downstairs at around 2am and again  requested
    that the victim become his wife. A sexual assault took place.

16. On 14 December 2017 the appellant was convicted after a trial  held  at
    Snaresbrook Crown Court on one count of sexual assault on a  female  by
    penetration.  He  was  sentenced  by  HHJ  del  Fabbro   to   5   years
    imprisonment, ordered to pay a �120 surcharge and ordered to  sign  the
    Sex Offenders Register for life.

17. The appellant continues to deny his guilt.

18. An OASys report dated 24 August 2020 identifies the appellant as having
    not demonstrated any insight as regards the impact of his offence  upon
    the victim. His risk to children was assessed to  be  at  its  greatest
    when under the influence of alcohol.

Deportation proceedings

19. A deportation order was signed on 2 October 2018 and served alongside a
    deportation decision dated 3 October 2018.

20. In the meantime, the appellant filed an out-of-time appeal against  his
    conviction  with  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  February  2019.  In   his
    application for an extension of time in which to appeal  the  appellant
    confirmed that his trial lawyers had advised  him  that  there  was  no
    identifiable error of law that could found a meriotorious  appeal.  The
    appellant relied upon grounds of appeal that he  drafted.  He  asserted
    that there had been  a  failure  by  the  CPS  to  comply  with  lawful
    disclosure.  He  referred  to  the  victim  as  being  a  liar  and   a
    manipulator. He accused the CPS of being  aware  that  the  victim  was
    lying and having taken steps to conceal evidence that  would  establish
    his innocence. An allegation was made as to police bias. Witnesses were
    accused of fabrication. Criticism was made of  judicial  directions  to
    the jury. An allegation was  made  that  the  jury  pool  was  tainted.
    Complaint was made that defence counsel erred in his professional  duty
    by failing to call three witnesses to give evidence. Complaint was also
    made that his solicitor had failed to disclose that he 'works  for  the
    CPS'.

21. On 19  August  2019  the  appellant's  application  to  appeal  against
    conviction was refused by a Single Judge of the Court of  Appeal.  Such
    decision was entirely to be expected considering the grounds of  appeal
    advanced.

22. The appellant submitted  further  representations  and  the  respondent
    refused his human rights claim by means of a decision  dated  11  March
    2020.

Hearing before the FtT

23. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Hatton Cross on 17 November
    2020. It was conducted remotely, by means of CVP. The Judge had  before
    her a range of documentation including documents  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant and a skeleton argument filed on his behalf.

24. The appellant contended that he suffered a miscarriage of  justice  and
    affirmed that he is  not  guilty  of  the  offence  for  which  he  was
    convicted in 2017. He stated that for the purpose of the appeal he  was
    rehabilitated. He confirmed that he is a very committed  Christian  and
    had founded a charity in Nigeria.

25. He relied upon medical conditions,  including  an  enlarged  prostrate,
    haemorrhoids, a stomach ulcer, and injuries to his shoulder and  wrist.
    He stated that his removal to Nigeria would be tantamount to  a  'death
    sentence' given his medical condition.

26. The appellant provided evidence that on 7 September 2020 he had applied
    for a child arrangement order at the Central Family Court, London.

27. He asserted that he supported his child  financially  and  if  deported
    would not be able to continue such support, nor have  contact  with  or
    build up  a  relationship  with  his  child.  He  provided  documentary
    evidence to establish such support.

28. I note documents filed with the First-tier Tribunal  establishing  that
    JB had sought child maintenance from the appellant by 2011, and that in
    2014 he was in arrears to the sum of approximately �13,400. In  October
    2014 he was informed by the Child Support Agency that he  was  required
    to pay the sum of �5 a week. An order  from  Bow  County  Court  issued
    following a hearing held in August 2015 confirms that the Child Support
    Agency secured a charge upon the appellant's home in  March  2015.  The
    Court ordered in  August  2015  that  the  charge  continue  with  sums
    remaining outstanding in maintenance.

29. I further note that the appellant filed two bank statements for October
    and December 2006 identifying two cheques in the sum of  �50  that  are
    said to  be  payments  in  respect  of  his  child.  He  provided  bank
    statements from July 2010 to November 2010  identifying  two  payments,
    each in the sum of �100, with a reference detailing that  they  related
    to his child. Such evidence pre-dates the Order  of  Bow  County  Court
    addressed above. No further evidence as to the payment  of  maintenance
    or the provision of funds supporting the child  was  filed  and  relied
    upon.

30. The appellant further detailed at the hearing that he would be at  risk
    of persecution upon return to Nigeria on  the  basis  of  his  being  a
    Christian. Such concerns were not raised in his witness statement of 20
    October 2020 and had not previously been detailed to the respondent.  I
    observe that in his witness statement the appellant  confirmed  at  �17
    that he intended to  visit  his  wife  and  children  in  Nigeria  upon
    revocation of the deportation order. The Judge noted that the appellant
    had not made an asylum application on this basis, despite  having  been
    notified in 2018 as to the respondent's intention to  deport  him.  The
    respondent did not give consent at the hearing for  this  issue  to  be
    considered  as  a  new  matter:  section  85(5)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ('the  2002  Act')  and  Hydar  (s  120
    response; s 85 "new matter": Birch) [2021] UKUT 176 (IAC). In any event
    I observe that the claim was vague in nature and on its face enjoys  no
    merits with Nigeria possessing a vibrant Christian community and having
    the largest Christian population in West Africa amounting  to  over  80
    million people. Further, the asserted fear does not correspond with the
    appellant's stated intention some three weeks  before  the  hearing  to
    visit Nigeria to see his family.

31. As to the hearing, the Judge observed at para. 9 of her decision:

         '9.  Although  there  were   increasing   difficulties   with   CVP
            connectivity during the hearing, the evidence of  the  appellant
            and the witnesses and submissions was recorded and is set out in
            full in the Record of Proceedings. Neither representative made a
            complaint nor argued that this had been detrimental  to  a  fair
            hearing. ...'

32. In her decision the Judge correctly observed that section 117C  of  the
    2002 Act and paragraph 398(a) of the Immigration  Rules  ('the  Rules')
    applied, with the appellant having been sentenced to a  custodial  term
    of over four years, and so he was required  to  show  that  the  public
    interest  in  his  deportation  was  outweighed  by   very   compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in section 117C(4) and (5)
    of the 2002 Act and paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Rules.

33. With regard to the appellant's child in this country, the  Judge  found
    at para. 30 that the appellant had not had any contact with  his  child
    since at least 2015. The Judge found at para. 31 that the appellant had
    not had a subsisting relationship with the child for at least 5  years.
    At para 32 the Judge held:

         '32. Further, as the appellant has had no contact with his  [child]
            since 2015 it is not considered that his deportation would  have
            an unduly harsh impact on [the child]. [The child] would be able
            to remain in the UK with [their] mother. I do not consider  that
            it would be unduly harsh if the appellant  was  deported  before
            the  court  application  for   contact   was   considered.   The
            appellant's [child] is now 16 years old and there is a  lack  of
            evidence to suggest that [the child] wants to see [their] father
            face-to-face. There was also a lack of evidence that his absence
            from his [child's] life was having a deleterious effect  on  his
            [child]. The appellant's  departure  would  not  interfere  with
            indirect contact, if his [child] was willing to engage  in  this
            and, if [the child] did want to see [the  appellant],  he  could
            visit him after [the child] turned 18.

34. As to the appellant's health,  the  Judge  records  at  para.  34  that
    counsel for the  appellant  confirmed  that  no  article  3  claim  was
    advanced. In respect of medicial health and article 8 the  Judge  found
    that the appellant could secure employment in Nigeria and pay  for  his
    treatment through his income.

35. In respect of the appellant's appeal against conviction, the Judge held
    at para. 37:

         '37. It has  been  argued  that  it  is  premature  to  deport  the
            appellant before the outcome of  his  application  to  the  full
            Court of Appeal. However, it was stated in the letter  from  the
            CCRC dated 3 February 2020 that the appellant would be  notified
            by the end of April as to whether the CCRC would refer his  case
            for review or required further time to decide whether or not  to
            do so. The appellant has not provided any  further  letter  from
            the CCRC. it is accepted that he has instructed a  solicitor  to
            assist him in relation to a potential appeal but, in the absence
            of further evidence, it is not accepted that the  appellant  has
            shown that the CCRC will undertake a review  or  an  application
            will be made to the full Court  of  Appeal  or  that  there  are
            merits to do so.

36. The Judge undertook the balancing  exercise  approved  by  the  Supreme
    Court in Hesham Ali v. Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2016] UKSC 60; [2016] 1 W.L.R. 4799. She  concluded  that  the  public
    interest rendered the decision to refuse the appellant leave to  remain
    on human rights grounds and to deport him to Nigeria proportionate.

Grounds of Appeal

37. Unfortunately, the grounds of  appeal  drafted  by  counsel  adopt  the
    unhelpful approach of not identifying individual grounds of  challenge.
    The individual grounds that could be  identified  were  jumbled  across
    several pages.

38. Mr. Uddin kindly informed me that there were three separate grounds  of
    challenge that can properly be summarised as follows:

         1)  The  decision  of  the  Judge  was  unlawful   for   procedural
            unfairness.


         2) Too  great  an  emphasis  was  placed  by  the  Judge  upon  the
            appellant's conviction in circumstances where the conviction was
            'under challenge'.


         3) The judge erred in her consideratipn of the appellant's  private
            and family life rights  when  considering  as  to  whether  very
            compelling circumstances arose outweighing the  public  interest
            in the appellant's deportation.


Decision on Error of Law

39. The respondent filed and served a skeleton  argument  authored  by  Mr.
    Lindsay, dated 21 April 2021. Mr. Lindsay noted, inter alia,  that  the
    appellant  had  filed  no  evidence  as  to  the   purported   problems
    experienced at the hearing  and  that  'insofar  as  [the  appellant's]
    grounds of appeal seek to make unsupported assertions  of  fact,  these
    should carry no weight.'

40. The appellant filed and served a  skeleton  argument  authored  by  Mr.
    Uddin, dated 6 May 2021.

Procedural unfairness

41. By  means  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  the  appellant  makes  several
    assertions as to the difficulties he and his witnesses are said to have
    experienced at the remote hearing. The issues identified at  paras.  4,
    6, 7 and 8 were not raised  as  a  concern  before  the  Judge  at  the
    hearing. As for the stated fact detailed at para.  5  of  the  grounds,
    namely that problems with the technology caused considerable disruption
    to the hearing, again no express concern was raised with the Judge.

42. There are several significant difficulties for the appellant.

43. Firstly, the complaints now advanced as to procedural fairness were not
    raised with the Judge, who was therefore provided  with  no  notice  of
    them. Consequently, the proper means for conveying the  now  identified
    concerns of the appellant and his witnesses before this Tribunal as  to
    their ability to hear questions posed and engage in  various  parts  of
    the proceedings was by filing and serving signed witness statements.  I
    observe that it is a mandatory  requirement  for  evidence  not  placed
    before the First-tier Tribunal that an application for its admission by
    this Tribunal be made under  rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. Such step was not taken  in  this  matter,
    despite the respondent having clearly informed the  appellant  and  his
    legal representatives in April 2021 that the unsupported assertions  of
    fact detailed within the grounds of appeal  should  properly  carry  no
    weight.

44. Rather, information as to the appellant's complaints, and those of  his
    witnesses, have been presented to this Tribunal by means of grounds  of
    appeal and counsel's skeleton argument. It is trite law  that  evidence
    cannot be presented for the first time in such form:  see  for  example
    M&P Enterprises (London) Ltd v Norfolk Square  (Northern  Section)  Ltd
    [2018] EWHC 2665 (Ch), at [71].

45. I identified to Mr. Uddin and the appellant that there was  a  singular
    lack of any evidence  filed  as  to  the  assertions  advanced  by  the
    appellant concerned with  procedural  unfairness.  I  granted  a  short
    adjournment to permit Mr. Uddin to take instructions as to whether  the
    appellant wished to apply for an adjournment to be  permitted  to  file
    and serve relevant  witness  statements  by  means  of  a  rule  15(2A)
    application. Upon his return some 20 minutes later, Mr. Uddin confirmed
    his instructions as being that the appellant wished to proceed with the
    hearing. Mr. Uddin recognised that he  could  not  properly  rely  upon
    assertions as to the experiences of the  appellant  and  his  witnesses
    made within the grounds of appeal and skeleton argument that  were  not
    raised before the Judge and were not evidenced before this Tribunal  by
    the appellant by witness statements.

46. Before considering Mr. Uddin's limited submission  on  this  ground,  I
    observe  that  the  appellant  was  represented  before  the  Judge  by
    experienced counsel, Professor  Rees,  who  made  no  complaint  as  to
    detriment or unfairness at the time of the  hearing.  The  Judge  could
    properly rely  upon  no  complaint  being  made  when  considering  the
    potential impact of technological difficulties. It is not recorded that
    the appellant personally made a complaint to the Judge as to procedural
    unfairness.

47. I am satisfied that  the  ground  now  advanced  implicitly  criticizes
    Professor Rees' conduct of the hearing. This must be  the  position  as
    the appellant now wishes to assert that the presentation of his case by
    Professor Rees was adversely impacted by technological issues and  that
    such concern was not properly advanced by counsel. It would be expected
    that if counsel considered themselves disadvantaged,  they  would  have
    informed the  Judge.  Complaint  is  also  made  that  the  appellant's
    witnesses were unable to hear questions posed to them  and  so  it  was
    unclear at the hearing as to whether  they  understood  the  questions.
    Again, Professor Rees raised no complaint, though if  it  was  apparent
    that witnesses were unable to hear questions counsel would be  expected
    to raise such concern with the judge.

48.  The  expected  course  to  be  adopted  when  criticism  is  made   of
    professional representatives in this Tribunal  is  to  write  to  them,
    identifying  the  substance  of  complaint,   and   to   secure   their
    observations in writing as to events. Such step permits  this  Tribunal
    the opportunity to consider complaints as to  professional  conduct  in
    the round. Such step was not undertaken in respect  of  Professor  Rees
    and consequently the Tribunal is left  entirely  unaware  of  counsel's
    view as to the criticism  made  in  relation  to  his  conduct  of  the
    appellant's appeal before the Judge.

49. Mr. Uddin submitted that the Judge accepted that  there  were  problems
    with the CVP technology at the hearing, and the appellant  should  have
    been  given  a  fair  hearing.  He  accepted  that  beyond   what   was
    acknowledged by the Judge at  para.  9  of  her  decision,  he  had  no
    evidence to rely upon as to such difficulties adversely impacting  upon
    the hearing. He further accepted that  Professor  Rees  had  raised  no
    complaint at the hearing and no step had been taken by the  appellant's
    legal representatives to ascertain from Professor Rees  as  to  why  he
    adopted this position.

50. I am satisfied  that  in  circumstances  where  neither  representative
    indicated a concern as to proceedings, and where technical difficulties
    are usually overcome without any impact upon the fairness of a hearing,
    the simple fact  that  there  were  technological  problems  is  wholly
    insufficient to establish procedural unfairness. This limb of ground  1
    is dismissed.

51. Mr. Uddin's general  submission  that  a  remote  CVP  hearing  is  not
    suitable for deportation appeal hearings enjoys no merit. As  confirmed
    by the Court of Appeal in Re: B  (Children)  (Remote  Hearing:  Interim
    Care Order) [2020] EWCA Civ 584, [2020] 2 F.L.R. 330,  remote  hearings
    can replicate some of the characteristics of a fully  attended  hearing
    and so provided that good practice is followed a remote hearing will be
    a fair hearing. I am further satisfied that the cross-examination of an
    appellant or witnesses in deportation proceedings is not  objectionable
    in the present climate. In the circumstances and being mindful  of  the
    general principles identified by the High Court in Municipio de Mariana
    v BHP Group Plc (formerly BHP Billiton) [2020] EWHC 928 (TCC), at [24],
    there is no merit to a general  challenge  as  to  the  suitability  of
    deportation hearings being heard remotely in the Immigration and Asylum
    Chamber.

52. In any event, this submission could not properly  be  advanced  by  the
    appellant. No objection was made on his behalf  to  the  holding  of  a
    remote hearing in this matter at the  case  management  review  hearing
    held before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Bulpitt on 2 October 2020,
    where the appellant was represented by Ms. P Glass of counsel. Nor  was
    any objection raised  by  Professor  Rees  before  the  Judge.  In  the
    circumstances, it is wholly inappropriate that complaint is now made in
    such  general  terms  that  a  deportation  hearing  cannot  fairly  be
    conducted by means of remote proceedings.

53. I further observe that para. 8 of the grounds enjoys no merits.  It  is
    simply conjecture as to whether the Judge could or could not  hear  the
    presenting officer's submissions and it would properly be expected  for
    the Judge to convey any difficulties  they  were  experiencing  to  the
    representatives. Further, the appellant had the benefit of counsel  who
    raised no complaint as to being unable to hear proceedings and  so  can
    properly be considered to have heard and understood all  that  occurred
    during the course of the hearing. This challenge is dismissed.

Too great a focus upon the criminal conviction

54. Before me, Mr. Uddin advanced no positive case on this ground save  for
    a request that I consider it as drafted in the grounds  of  appeal.  In
    its entirety the ground is identified as:

         '10.  The  Judge  has  focused  extensively  on   the   appellant's
            conviction, for which the appellant had provided  evidence  that
            he was challenging. The Judge ought to have focused more on  the
            merits of the case as a pose [sic] to refusing this appeal on  a
            conviction that he knew was under challenge.'

55. The  ground  as  drafted  wholly  fails  to  engage  with  the  present
    deportation regime, established both by statute and the Rules. For  the
    purposes of this appeal  it  is  clear  that  (i)  a  foreign  criminal
    convicted of an offence to which identified conditions apply is  to  be
    deported: section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007; (ii) when  considering
    whether a decision to  deport  breaches  protected  human  rights,  the
    Tribunal  is  required  to  consider  the  public  interest   and   the
    deportation of foreign criminals is in  the  public  interest:  section
    117C(1) of the 2002 Act; and (iii) the index offence and conviction are
    properly placed in the balancing  exercise  as  they  are  incorporated
    within the deportation of  a  foreign  criminal  being  in  the  public
    interest and in  the  application,  or  otherwise,  of  the  exceptions
    identified in section 117C(3) to (6).

56. Further, the ground wholly fails to  engage  with  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal against  his  conviction  was
    refused by the Single Judge in 2019. There is no present  challenge  to
    the conviction under  section  1  of  the  Criminal  Appeal  Act  1968.
    Therefore, the  assertion  that  there  is  an  extant  'challenge'  is
    misleading and should not properly have been asserted by  counsel  when
    drafting the grounds or relied upon at the hearing.

57. What is being pursued  by  the  appellant  is  an  application  to  the
    Criminal Cases Review Commission ('CCRC') seeking  a  referral  to  the
    Court of Appeal. This application  was  initially  made  in  or  around
    October 2019 and I understand that to date no decision has been reached
    by the CCRC as to whether a referral will or  will  not  be  made.  The
    Commission is required to consider as to whether new evidence or a  new
    legal  argument  has  been  identified  that   now   makes   the   case
    significantly  different  to  that  when  permission  to   appeal   was
    originally refused.  Such  evidence  or  argument  must,  save  for  in
    exceptional circumstances, not have been considered at the time of  the
    trial or at the initial appeal. I take judicial notice that the  number
    of referrals to the Court of Appeal is low (in the  region  of  3%)  in
    comparison to files opened by the CCRC.

58. In his witness statement before the First-tier Tribunal, the  appellant
    provided no detail as to whether any new evidence or argument was being
    advanced to the CCRC. Indeed, the witness statement  dated  20  October
    2020 is in my consideration woefully  light  in  providing  any  cogent
    detail on any relevant matter. Very limited detail was provided in oral
    evidence to the Judge, as recorded at para. 37  of  the  decision,  and
    before me the appellant was entirely incapable of remembering the  name
    of the solicitors' firm he had instructed in respect of his application
    to the CCRC, despite his confirmation to me that he  had  spoken  to  a
    solicitor at the firm in June 2021.

59.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Judge  considered  the  public   interest
    appropriately, gave due weight to the conviction  when  conducting  the
    balancing  exercise  at  para.  39  and  gave  due  weight  to  factors
    favourable to the appellant. There is simply no merit in  this  ground,
    which should never have been advanced, and it is dismissed.

Private and family life rights

60. Para. 11 of the grounds makes the  bald  submission  that,  "The  Judge
    ought to have focused more on the appellant's private and  family  life
    having found that paragraph 24 that he has established a  private  life
    in the UK that would engage article 8, having been in the UK  for  more
    than 20 years."

61. The next  four  paragraphs  of  the  grounds  are  concerned  with  the
    appellant's child and can properly be identified as follows:

         1) The Judge erred in  law  in  relying  upon  the  fact  that  the
            appellant had not enjoyed a  subsisting  relationship  with  his
            child for at least five years, "the correct application  of  the
            law would be to assess  whether  or  not  the  relationship  was
            subsisting": para. 12 of grounds.


         2) The Judge erred in  not  placing  appropriate  weight  upon  the
            appellant's application to the Family  Court  for  an  order  in
            respect of his child: para. 13


         3) The Judge erred in not explaining  as  to  why  the  appellant's
            child should wait two years until they were 18 before they could
            visit their father in Nigeria: para. 14


         4) The Judge erred in failing to sufficiently  explore  the  impact
            the appellant's deportation would have upon his child: para. 15

62. Again, this ground of appeal is entirely misconceived  and  should  not
    properly have been advanced. As accepted by Mr.  Uddin  before  me  the
    appellant has not had a subsisting relationship with his child for over
    five years. There is not said to have been any contact at  all  between
    father and child during such time. Mr. Uddin withdrew reliance upon the
    paragraphs asserting that there was a subsisting  relationship  between
    father and child.

63. It is extremely unfortunate that grounds  have  been  drafted  in  this
    mattrer  advancing  a  case  based  upon  the  purported   impact   the
    appellant's deportation would have upon the child. There is no merit at
    all in paras 14 and 15 of the grounds, which have no tangible nexus  to
    the actual facts existing in this matter. These  grounds  should  never
    have been advanced.

64. I indicated to Mr. Uddin that para. 12 of the grounds was  nonsensical.
    If there had been no subsisting relationship for at least  five  years,
    what else was the Judge to find other  than  there  was  no  subsisting
    relationship at the date of the decision. This ground should never have
    been advanced.

65. In respect of the appellant's application for a child arrangement order
    filed with the Family Court some two months prior to the hearing before
    the Judge the appellant's challenge wholly fails  to  engage  with  the
    clear findings at para. 32 that it would not be unduly harsh for him to
    be  deported  before  the  court  application  was  considered  in  the
    circumstances existing in this case. I observe that the  appellant  has
    had minimal contact with the child for over five years. Though  it  was
    asserted by the appellant that he supports his child  financially,  the
    evidence as to such fact presented to the Judge was extremely  limited.
    Indeed, the evidence suggested, on  balance,  that  the  appellant  was
    tardy  in  acknowledging  his  parental  commitments  requiring   court
    proceedings to be initiated to secure  a  charge  on  his  property  in
    respect of outstanding maintenance. No evidence was provided as to  the
    child  having  any  interest  in  contact  with  their   father   being
    established. I observe that  in  the  month  the  child  was  born  the
    appellant had commenced living  with  VM,  as  confirmed  by  his  2005
    application for leave to remain. There is no evidence that  father  and
    child have ever resided together  in  a  family  home.  The  Judge  was
    therefore able to make an informed and reasoned decision  as  to  there
    being no subsisting relationship between father and child.

66. In the circumstances, I have considered the reported  decisions  of  RS
    (immigration and family court  proceedings)  India  [2012]  UKUT  00218
    (IAC) and Mohammed (Family Court proceedings  -  outcome)  [2014]  UKUT
    00419 (IAC) as well as  Mohan  v.  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2012] EWCA  Civ  1363,  [2013]  1  W.L.R.  922   and  I  am
    satisfied that the Judge gave cogent and  lawful  reasons  for  finding
    that the late issuing of Family Court proceedings did not outweigh  the
    public interest in deportation. She lawfully concluded that the outcome
    of the contemplated proceedings was unlikely to  be  material  in  this
    matter.

67. I observe R (Singh) v. Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2014] EWHC 461 (Admin) where  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  when
    considering a claim that deportation would violate article 8 because of
    a close and subsisting bond with a child in the United  Kingdom,  there
    was a clear and obvious difference between a case in which contact  (or
    now  child  arrangement  order)  proceedings  were  pursued  against  a
    background of prior contact and genuine interest on the one hand, and a
    case in which such proceedings had been initiated only on the  date  of
    removal with limited evidence of prior contact. On the evidence  placed
    before the Judge, both documentary and in his evidence,  the  appellant
    came nowhere close to establishing that he fell  anywhere  but  in  the
    latter category, having delayed seeking a Family Court order until just
    before the hearing of his deportation appeal. I am satisfied  that  the
    application for an order from the Family Court is  strongly  suggestive
    of being predicated solely on a desire to remain in this country.

68. As for the appellant having been present in this country  for  over  20
    years, it is not explained as to how this  could  properly  reduce  the
    public interest in his deportation in circumstances where he has  spent
    over half of his life,  including  his  formative  years,  residing  in
    Nigeria and he was sentenced to 5  years  imprisonment  for  a  serious
    sexual  assault.  This  challenge  is,  at  its   highest,   a   simple
    disagreement with the decision reached by the Judge and was not pursued
    with vigour by Mr. Uddin. I dismiss all limbs of ground 3.

Postscript

69. It is unfortunate that the First-tier Tribunal  granted  permission  to
    appeal in this  matter  when  there  were  no  merits  to  the  grounds
    advanced. The focus of the Judge granting permission to appeal  was  on
    procedural unfairness, but it was abundantly clear  that  there  was  a
    significant failure by the appellant to evidence his complaint.

70. I take this opportunity to observe that even if the  substance  of  the
    appellant's complaint as to procedural fairness identified  within  the
    grounds of appeal was taken at its highest and observing the importance
    of the right to be  heard,  the  appellant  could  not  succeed  as  no
    reasonable judge  could  properly  conclude  that  there  was  material
    irregularity. When taking the appellant's underlying human rights  case
    at its highest, no  reasonable  judge  could  conclude  that  the  very
    compelling circumstances test  could  properly  be  satisfied  in  this
    matter: section 117C(6) of the 2002 Act. The test is a  very  stringent
    one. No criticism can  properly  be  made  of  the  balancing  exercise
    undertaken by the Judge in this matter. In respect of the  factors  the
    appellant has sought to rely upon little weight can  be  given  in  his
    favour with respect to his education in this  country,  to  his  church
    attendance, the  friendships  he  has  developed  with  people  in  the
    community or to his charity work. Whilst he has resided in this country
    for over 20 years, he has served a custodial sentence  arising  from  a
    very serious sexual offence for which he received a custodial term of 5
    years and in relation to which he continues to deny his guilt.  He  has
    no insight into his offending behaviour, and his failure to engage with
    his  sexual  offending  is  strongly  suggestive   that   he   is   not
    rehabilitated. He possesses no subsisting relationship with  his  child
    in this country.

71. The appellant has produced little or  no  evidence  that  he  has  been
    pursuing a decision from the CCRC, and indeed has produced no detail as
    to any suitable  ground  having  been  identified  to  suggest  that  a
    reference could meritoriously be made  to  the  Court  of  Appeal.  The
    grounds of appeal drafted by the appellant to the Court  of  Appeal  in
    2019 are strongly suggestive of a man wholly unwilling to  engage  with
    his criminality, seeking to blame everyone from the  judge,  his  legal
    team, the CPS, the police, the jury and the victim for his  conviction.
    I note the approach adopted by the appellant  because  the  failure  to
    engage with his offending behaviour is also identified in his letter to
    the respondent dated 2 September 2019 where  he  denied  his  guilt  in
    respect of two of his  four  convictions  before  Magistrates'  Courts,
    dated 2009 and 2014, observing, inter alia, that specimen results  were
    unconnected to him.  I observe that the appellant possesses a trait  of
    identifying himself as the  victim  of  miscarriage  of  justice,  with
    accompanying indications that he will file out of time appeals  without
    identifying any cogent basis for  the  proposed  challenge  having  any
    merits.

72. I am satisfied that the appellant is using his application to the  CCRC
    simply as means of seeking to delay his deportation.

73. His effort to raise a weak  asylum  claim  at  the  hearing  is,  I  am
    satisfied, further evidence that the appellant  is  simply  seeking  to
    defer his deportation.

74. His very late application to the Family Court for an order  in  respect
    of his child, with whom he has had no contact  for  over  5  years,  is
    strongly suggestive of being predicated on a desire to remain  in  this
    country.

75. I made clear to the appellant at the hearing, in the  presence  of  his
    counsel, that if he were to exercise his right of appeal  against  this
    decision, he will be required to expressly inform the Court  of  Appeal
    that he instructed his counsel to proceed with the hearing after I  had
    given time for advice and instructions to be provided in relation to an
    adjournment. The Court of Appeal should also properly be informed  that
    Mr. Uddin made no oral submissions as to ground 2 and withdrew reliance
    upon the majority of the arguments advanced in ground 3.

Notice of decision

76. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of a material error on a point of law.

77. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  sent  to  the  parties  on  3
    December 2020 is upheld. The appeal is dismissed.
