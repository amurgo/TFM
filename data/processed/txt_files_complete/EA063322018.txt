                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant  to  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Welsh ("the judge"), promulgated on 14 February 2019, in
    which she dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  the
    Respondent dated 5  September  2018,  refusing  to  issue  her  with  a
    permanent residence card under the Immigration (European Economic Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the Regulations").

 2. The Appellant had originally come to the United  Kingdom  in  2010  and
    upon application had been issued with a residence card on 28 May  2013,
    running for the usual five-year period.  By an application made  on  24
    May 2018 the Appellant sought a permanent residence card.  In  refusing
    the application, the Respondent concluded that insufficient evidence of
    ongoing dependency and/or membership of the  EEA  national's  household
    since 2014 had been provided.

The judge's decision

 3. The judge set out the evidence before her and then  made  reference  to
    the relevant legal framework, in particular Regulations 15 and  8.   At
    paragraph 21 she goes to set out a number of  self-directions  relating
    to the issue of dependency, referring  specifically  to  the  cases  of
    Reyes Case C-423/12 and Lim [2016]  Imm AR 421, [2015] EWCA Civ 1383.

 4. The judge found the Sponsor and additional witnesses  to  be  credible.
    She found that the Appellant had been living in her own property  since
    2014 and had been in  full-time  employment  for  a  number  of  years,
    earning approximately �2,000 a month.  She found that  after  rent  had
    been paid the Appellant had disposable income of some �500 a month left
    over which she put aside for saving.  The judge also accepted that  the
    relevant EEA national had provided her with between  �150  and  �200  a
    month.  The Appellant used this to help with payment of her rent.

 5. At paragraph 24 the judge concluded that the Appellant was not a member
    of the EEA national's household and had not been  so  since  2014.   At
    paragraph 25 she concluded that the Appellant was not dependent on  the
    EEA national or his spouse (the Appellant's sister) because whilst  she
    had accepted their contribution of  approximately  �200  a  month,  the
    Appellant had not needed this money in  order  to  meet  her  essential
    daily living requirements.  She found that the  Appellant's  take  home
    pay was sufficient to meet those expenses.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge failed  to  deal  with  the
    permanent residence issue clearly or at all, that the judge  failed  to
    make clear findings in respect of what was described as the "emotional"
    dependency issue, and failed to give any or any adequate reasons.

 7. Permission to appeal was refused by the First-tier Tribunal but granted
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins on 5 June 2019.

The hearing

 8. At the hearing before me Mr Layne initially sought to amend the grounds
    of  appeal  by  including  a  challenge  to  the  judge's  findings  on
    membership of the  EEA  national's  household.   This  application  was
    opposed by Ms Everett.

 9. I refused the application.  There was no good  reason  as  to  why  the
    point  had  not  been  made  in  the  original  grounds.   No   written
    application had been made in advance of the hearing before me and there
    was no adequate reason for this. Making an application at  the  hearing
    itself in these circumstances was way too late in the day.  Further, in
    light of the judge's clear  findings  of  fact,  the  proposed  amended
    ground of appeal held very little prospect of success, if any at all.

10. Mr Layne relied on the original grounds but sought  to  expand  on  the
    second of these (if indeed  this  did  not  in  reality  amount  to  an
    amendment) by suggesting that the judge should,  on  the  facts  found,
    have concluded that there was relevant dependency by the  Appellant  on
    the EEA national and that the appeal should have been allowed.  It  had
    been accepted that money provided by the Sponsor had been used  by  the
    Appellant to go towards her rent and rent was an essential part  of  an
    individual's living expenses.

11. Mr Layne accepted that the reference in the original grounds of  appeal
    to "emotional" dependency was misconceived.

12. Mr Layne also submitted that the reasons set out in paragraphs  24  and
    25 were impermissibly brief.  No further submissions were made  on  the
    first ground.

13. Ms Everett submitted that the grounds were  ill-conceived.   The  judge
    had correctly directed herself as to the law on dependency.  Whilst the
    Appellant had been in receipt of some money from the Sponsor,  she  had
    chosen to spend it on rent.  She did not need to do so  as  her  income
    would have been sufficient to cover all relevant expenses.  Ms  Everett
    also submitted that whilst the reasons provided were relatively  brief,
    in the circumstances they were adequate.

14. In reply, Mr Layne re-emphasised the points already made.

Decision on error of law

15. I conclude that there are no material errors  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.

16. The first point to be made is that  the  grounds  of  appeal  refer  to
    "emotional" dependency only.  Whilst Mr Layne  has  in  my  view  quite
    rightly accepted that this is wrong, these  nonetheless  stand  as  the
    grounds of appeal and in my  view  the  reliance  on  such  a  form  of
    dependency is wholly misconceived and the Appellant's appeal  fails  on
    this basis alone.

17. However,  for  the  sake  of  completeness,  I  deal  with  Mr  Layne's
    substantive point as to financial dependency.  It  is  clear  that  the
    judge correctly directed herself to the law on  dependency.   Paragraph
    21 of the decision sets out a full and accurate summary of the relevant
    elements applicable to the test.  The judge made favourable findings as
    to the credibility  of  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor.   Part  of  those
    findings was that the Appellant's own income was sufficient to meet the
    relevant daily living expenses, including rent.  The money given to her
    on a regular basis by the Sponsor, whilst no doubt helpful, was clearly
    in the judge's view a bonus, so to speak.  It did not form an essential
    element of the daily living expenses.  The reasons,  albeit  relatively
    brief, set out in paragraph 25 are clear and make the point  more  than
    adequately:

         "I find the Appellant is  not  dependent  on  Mr  and  Mrs  Jalonen
         because, though I accept their evidence that they  give  her  about
         �200 a month, she does not need this money in  order  to  meet  her
         basic requirements.  Her take-home pay is  sufficient  to  pay  her
         rent, bills and living expenses."

18. The figures spoke for themselves:  the  Appellant's  rent  was  �630  a
    month; she chose to use the  Sponsor's  �150-�200  contribution  to  go
    towards that rent; she had �500 left over each month. If  one  were  to
    have removed the contribution from the equation, the Appellant had more
    than enough in the pot to meet her essential living needs.




19. On the facts found and in light of the accurate self-direction  on  the
    law, the judge was plainly entitled to reach the  conclusion  that  she
    did.  There is no error in this respect.

20. As already mentioned, the reasons provided are relatively brief, but  I
    agree with Ms Everett to the extent that all depends  on  the  context.
    In this particular case, the findings having been set  out  previously,
    the concluding reasons in paragraphs  24  and,  importantly,  25,  were
    concise and adequate.  Brevity of  reasoning  does  not  in  of  itself
    disclose an error of law.

21. Dealing very briefly with the  first  ground  of  appeal,  it  is  with
    respect entirely misconceived.  The judge quite clearly dealt with  the
    core issues raised in the appeal before her.  There is no error in this
    respect whatsoever.

Anonymity

22. No anonymity direction had been made by  the  judge  and  there  is  no
    reason for me to make one at this stage.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain errors of law.

That decision shall stand.

The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
