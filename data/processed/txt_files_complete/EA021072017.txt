                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The SSHD sought and was granted permission to appeal a decision  of
         the First-tier Tribunal which allowed Mr  [O]'s  appeal  against  a
         decision of the SSHD revoking his Permanent  Residence  Card  dated
         10th February 2017.

         Background

      2. Mr [O] entered Germany in 1997 and met  his  now  deceased  ex-wife
         there. In 2000 they moved to the UK and  they  were  married  in  a
         Registry Office in Southwark in December 2000. He was issued with a
         residence card in February 2002 and then in 2006 was issued with  a
         permanent residence card. The SSHD accepted that Ms [NN],  his  ex-
         wife, a German citizen, was exercising  Treaty  rights  in  the  UK
         during that period.

      3. In April 2015 Mr [O] applied to naturalise;  that  application  was
         refused. He applied again in September 2015 and the application was
         again refused and it was at that time  he  became  aware  that  the
         nature of his marriage was under consideration. He was then  served
         with the  decision  revoking  his  Permanent  Residence  card,  the
         decision which is the subject of this appeal.

      4. The First-tier Tribunal judge found Mr [O] "credible in respect  of
         all aspects of his appeal" and accepted Mr [O]'s evidence regarding
         his relationship with his wife as credible, namely:

          i) His wife became very angry with him when she  discovered  that
             he had fathered two children with their  landlady,  born  2004
             and 2005  (one  of  those  children  has  since  died  but  he
             maintains contact with the other).

         ii) He had told her of the birth of the children in 2005.

        iii) She subsequently forgave him, and their marriage continued.

         iv) Their marriage broke down in 2008 and was  dissolved  in  2009
             but they remained good friends.

          v) They subsequently reconciled after about two years  and  lived
             together again in the UK between about 2011 and 2013.

         vi) His ex-wife returned to live in Germany in 2013 and the couple
             remained good friends and in touch with each other.

        vii) That had it not been for her death  on  2nd  April  2018,  she
             would have attended the hearing of his appeal before the First-
             tier Tribunal to give evidence in accordance with her  witness
             statement.

      5. Ms [NN] signed a witness statement on 3rd March 2018 in  which  she
         fully supported the account given by Mr [O], confirmed  that  their
         relationship  was  genuine  and  that  she  fully   supported   his
         application for a Residence Card and then for a Permanent Residence
         Card. She confirmed his account of the extra marital  affair,  that
         she accepted his apology, that they were reconciled  but  then  the
         marriage broke down and she moved back to Germany.

      6. The First-tier Tribunal judge found  that  Mr  [O]  was  not  in  a
         relationship with the mother of the two children at the time of his
         marriage to Ms [NN] or when he was granted his  residence  card  or
         when he was granted his permanent  residence  card.  There  was  no
         challenge by the respondent to the evidence  that  the  couple  had
         lived together in Germany prior to coming to the UK in 2000 or that
         they were living together in the UK between 2000 and 2002 when they
         were married.

         First-tier Tribunal decision

      7. The First-tier Tribunal found:

               9) [Mr [O]] brings this appeal and therefore bears the burden
                  of proof. [Mr [O]] must satisfy the burden on a balance of
                  probabilities.

             ...

             (21) ... I accept the submissions of [Mr [O]'s] representative
                  that the matters raised by the [SSHD] in  respect  of  [Mr
                  [O]] becoming a father with another woman is not  relevant
                  when assessing whether the marriage entered into is one of
                  convenience that conclusion just does not fit in with  the
                  factual matrix of this appeal.

         Error of Law

      8. The SSHD sought and was granted permission to appeal on the grounds
         firstly  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  had  applied   the
         incorrect burden of proof (Sadovska [2017  UKSC  54)  and  secondly
         that the judge failed to take into account the fact of  him  having
         two children outside marriage (Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage of
         convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038.

      9. On the face of the decision the First-tier Tribunal judge  has  not
         approached the burden of proof correctly. There is no  burden  upon
         an appellant to  demonstrate  that  his  marriage  is  not  one  of
         convenience; the  evidential  burden  lies  upon  an  appellant  to
         address evidence that justifies a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the
         marriage was entered into for the predominant purpose  of  securing
         residence rights. In this case, as submitted by  Mr  Jafferji,  the
         First-tier Tribunal judge has approached the issue as one of Mr [O]
         proving that his marriage was not one  of  convenience.  The  judge
         has, he submitted applied a higher burden and standard upon Mr  [O]
         than was called for and this, if anything,  reinforces  the  First-
         tier Tribunal judge's decision to allow the appeal.

     10. The recitation by the First-tier Tribunal that the existence of the
         two children was not relevant was, submitted Mr  Jafferji,  because
         when read in the context of the decision, it was correct. The judge
         accepted that Mr [O] and his ex-wife were  credible  witnesses  and
         that the factual account (unchallenged by the SSHD by me) was  true
         - he did not know the mother of  the  two  children  prior  to  his
         marriage and they were not (and are not) in a relationship when  he
         and Ms [NN] married, they had lived together in Germany and in  the
         UK prior to their marriage  and  had  remained  good  friends  (and
         rekindled their relationship for a couple  of  years)  after  their
         divorce.  Mr  Jafferji  submitted  that  there  was   no   evidence
         sufficient to justify  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  Mr  [O]  had
         entered into a marriage of convenience. He submitted that there was
         no evidence Mr [O] had deceived his wife;  no  evidence  that  both
         parties were a party to a marriage of convenience; no evidence that
         the parties to the marriage were  even  complicit  in  arranging  a
         marriage to enable Mr [O] to remain  in  the  UK;  that  the  SSHD,
         despite raising a question about the marriage in December 2015  had
         undertaken no investigation at all for example by contacting the ex-
         wife or by contacting the mother of the two children; that had  the
         SSHD seriously wished to discharge the burden  on  him  then  there
         would have been at least some investigation.

     11. I accept Mr Jafferji's submission that the burden of proof  as  set
         out in the decision by the First-tier Tribunal ([9]) has  placed  a
         higher and incorrect burden upon Mr [O]. This has  meant  that  the
         findings made by the judge have been made with that in  mind  -  he
         has found  Mr  [O]'s  account  of  his  relationship  credible  and
         sustainable in the context,  in  effect  although  erroneously,  of
         having accepted that the SSHD has raised  a  reasonable  suspicion.
         The last sentence in [21] is not straightforward when read  out  of
         context. But when read in the context of the evidence as a whole it
         is plain that the relationship is of no relevance  to  whether  the
         marriage was one of convenience - Mr [O] did not know the mother of
         the two children prior to his marriage to Ms  [NN];  there  was  no
         suggestion that he  had  known  her  when  he  obtained  his  first
         residence permit, there was no suggestion that he intended to  live
         with the mother of the two children and he and his  wife  continued
         to live together as  husband  and  wife  after  the  birth  of  the
         children, during the currency  of  the  application  for  permanent
         residence and thereafter. There was no reasonable suspicion by  the
         SSHD sufficient to shift the burden to Mr [O].

     12. Although the First-tier Tribunal applied the  incorrect  burden  of
         proof and could have explained his decision that the birth  of  the
         two children was not relevant to the decision he had to  make  with
         more clarity, those errors are not material to the outcome  of  the
         appeal.

     13. There is no material error of law by the First-tier  Tribunal  such
         that the decision is set aside to be remade.

Conclusions:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
