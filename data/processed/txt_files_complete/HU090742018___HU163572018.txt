                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                TAHIR SALEEM
                               SHAISTA PARVEEN
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Dhanji (counsel) directly instructed by the
appellants.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Seelhoff promulgated  on  15/11/2018,  which
allowed the Appellants' appeals.

Background


3. The appellants are spouses. The First Appellant was born  on  13/04/1985.
The second appellant was born on 8/10/1981. On 29/03/2018 the  Secretary  of
State refused the Appellants' applications for leave to remain in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Seelhoff ("the Judge") allowed the appeals  against  the  Respondent's
decision.  Grounds of appeal were lodged  and  on  10/12/2018  Judge  Parkes
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia


      3. The grounds argue that the Judge erred in placing too  much  weight
      on the approach of HMRC in contrast to the guidance  in  the  case  of
      Khan [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) having regard to the adverse findings  made
      against the appellant. There is no reference to Khan in  the  decision
      and the approach of HMRC may have been misconstrued.


      4. The grounds disclose arguable  errors  of  law  and  permission  to
      appeal is granted.

The Hearing

5. For the respondent, Mr Duffy moved the grounds  of  appeal.  He  told  me
that the Judge placed too  much  weight  on  the  fact  that  HMRC  did  not
penalise the appellant. He argued that HMRC will  not  impose  penalties  on
people who report themselves for an understated income tax return and  offer
payment. He told me that the question that the Judge should have  determined
is whether or not the appellant deliberately underreported earnings to  HMRC
for financial benefit. He told me that the Judge's findings are unsafe,  and
relied on Khan [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC). He asked me to set the decision  aside
and remit this case to the First-tier Tribunal.

6. (a) For the appellants, Mr Plowright  relied  on  the  rule  24  response
which the appellants (themselves) served. He told me that  the  decision  in
Khan [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) postdates promulgation of the  Judge's  decision.
He  told  me  that  the  Judge  adopted  the  well-established  approach  of
determining whether or not a prima facie case of  dishonesty  is  made  out,
and then considers the explanation given by the appellant.

(b) Mr Plowright told me that the Judge writes a  careful  consideration  of
the evidence. The Judge takes account of the evidence from a  representative
of an accountancy firm, and that, in fact, the Judge  follows  the  guidance
in Khan [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC). He told me that  at  [40]  and  [44]  of  the
decision, the Judge accepts the explanation provided by the  accountant.  He
reminded me that the weight to be attached to each strand of evidence  is  a
question for the Judge at first instance. He urged me to dismiss the  appeal
and allow the decision to stand.

Analysis

7. The Judge's decision was promulgated on 15 November  2018.  The  decision
in Khan [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) it was promulgated on  3  May  2018,  but  was
only reported on 16 November 2018.

8. R (on the application  of  Khan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
Department (Dishonesty, tax return,  paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  00384
(IAC) held that (1) Where there has been a  significant  difference  between
the income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain  and  the
income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of  State  is  entitled  to  draw  an
inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest  and  therefore
he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.
Such an inference could be expected where there is no plausible  explanation
for the discrepancy; (2) Where an Applicant has presented evidence  to  show
that, despite the prima facie inference, he was not in  fact  dishonest  but
only  careless,  then  the  Secretary  of  State  must  decide  whether  the
explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her view, to displace  the  prima
facie inference of deceit/dishonesty; (3) In approaching  that  fact-finding
task, the Secretary of  State  should  remind  herself  that,  although  the
standard of proof is the "balance of probability", a finding that  a  person
has been deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very  serious
finding with serious consequences; (4) For an Applicant simply to blame  his
or her accountant for an "error" in relation to the  historical  tax  return
will not be the end of the matter, given that the accountant will or  should
have asked the tax payer to confirm that the  return  was  accurate  and  to
have signed the tax return. Furthermore, the Applicant will  have  known  of
his or her earnings and will have expected  to  pay  tax  thereon.   If  the
Applicant does not take  steps  within  a  reasonable  time  to  remedy  the
situation, the Secretary of State may be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
failure justifies a conclusion that there has  been  deceit  or  dishonesty;
(5) When considering whether or not the Applicant  is  dishonest  or  merely
careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the  following  matters,
inter alia, as well as the extent to which they are  evidenced  (as  opposed
to asserted):

    (i)    Whether the explanation for  the  error  by  the  accountant  is
    plausible;


    (ii)   Whether the documentation which can be  assumed  to  exist  (for
    example, correspondence between the Applicant and his accountant at the
    time of the tax return) has been disclosed  or  there  is  a  plausible
    explanation for why it is missing;


    (iii)  Why the Applicant did not realise that an error  had  been  made
    because his liability to pay tax was less than he should have expected;


    (iv)   Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps  to  remedy
    the situation  and,  if  so,  when  those  steps  were  taken  and  the
    explanation for any significant delay.

9.  The Judge's findings of fact start at [37] of the decision. At [38]  the
Judge sets out an accurate summary of the financial  discrepancies  in  this
case. For the tax year  ending  2011  the  second  appellant's  tax  returns
identified profit of just �2013, when in fact her profit was  more  than  10
times that sum - �23,489. The figures for the year to  2013  given  to  HMRC
showed a profit from self-employment of only �694, when the accurate  figure
is �30,649.

10. The Judge heard evidence from a junior member of a firm of  accountants.
The accountants say that inaccurate figures were produced  to  HMRC  through
the negligence of a trainee accountant in their firm.  The  Judge  finds  at
[44]  that  the  second  appellant's  management  of  business  affairs  was
shockingly negligent and reckless. The Judge finds

         "I do not consider that the appellant has an  adequate  excuse  for
         failing to realise that such errors were made however that  amounts
         to a finding of negligence or carelessness."

11. The  Judge  concludes  [44]  by  finding  that  the  second  appellant's
"negligence and carelessness" does not engage the  suitability  requirements
of the rules. At [45] the Judge finds that  the  appellants  have  not  been
dishonest.

12. The degree of enquiry required by the guidance given  in  headnote  four
in  the rubric to Khan has not been followed. The Judge's finding  that  the
second appellant has been shockingly negligent  &  reckless,  and  that  her
accountants committed  appalling  errors,  cannot  be  reconciled  with  the
guidance that blaming an accountant is not the end of  the  matter.  Enquiry
into the appellant's state of  knowledge,  particularly  why  the  appellant
believes that having earned a significant income their liability  to  income
tax is negligible, is missing from the decision.

13. This is perhaps an unusual case. There are differences between  declared
income and actual taxable income which one might expect  to  be  obvious  to
the appellant. There is evidence that the accountants make an  admission  of
negligence. But the fact-finding exercise is incomplete because there is  no
enquiry into the  appellant's  state  of  knowledge  about  the  ability  to
repeatedly earn significant sums of  money  and  not  attract  liability  to
income tax. There is an absence of fact-finding  about  the  timing  of  the
realisation that accounting errors had been made. There  is  an  absence  of
fact-finding about the figures provided to  the  accountants.  There  is  an
absence of fact-finding about who signed the tax returns.

14. The Judge's finding at [44] that the second appellant does not  have  an
adequate excuse  for  failing  to  realise  errors  were  made  is  entirely
inconsistent with the Judge's finding that the respondent is wrong  to  rely
on paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules. The  guidance  given  in  Khan
was given the day after  the  Judge's  decision  was  promulgated,  but  the
guidance given in Khan is consistent with the earlier decisions in Samant  v
SSHD [2017] UKAIT JR/6546/2016 and Abassi JR/13807/2016.

15.  Because  the  fact-finding  exercise  is  incomplete  and  because  the
decision the Judge reaches is not consistent with what is said at [44],  the
decision is tainted by material error of law. I set  it  aside.  I  consider
whether I can substitute my own decision. The material error of law  in  the
decision relates to an inadequacy of fact finding. I  cannot  substitute  my
own decision. Further fact-finding exercise is necessary.

Remittal to First-Tier Tribunal

16. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal  Practice  Statement
of the 25th of September 2012 the case may be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

   (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the First-
   tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other  opportunity  for  that  party's
   case to be put to and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or


   (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is  necessary
   in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-made  is  such  that,
   having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to
   remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

17. In this case I have determined that the case should be remitted  because
a new fact-finding exercise is required.  None of the findings of  fact  are
to stand and a complete re hearing is necessary.

18. I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal sitting  at  Hatton  Cross
to be heard before any First-tier Judge other than Judge Seelhoff.

Decision

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is tainted  by  material  errors
of law.

20. I set aside the Judge's decision promulgated on 15  November  2018.  The
appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined of new.
