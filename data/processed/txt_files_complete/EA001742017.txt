Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Benfield, Counsel, instructed by LRP Legal
                    Rights Partnership
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, has permission to  challenge  the
    decision of Judge Nixon of the First-tier Tribunal sent  on  3  January
    2018 dismissing his appeal against the decision made by the  respondent
    on 15 December 2016 refusing to issue a residence card as  confirmation
    of the  appellant's  right  of  residence  in  the  UK  under  European
    Community  law.   The  respondent  considered  that  the  marriage  the
    appellant had entered into with Ms Elena Nita was one  of  convenience.
    The judge reached the same conclusion.  By the  date  of  the  marriage
    interviews and also before the judge, the couple had a child  (born  in
    March 2015).

2.   The appellant's grounds had essentially  two  strands:  one  contending
    that the judge wrongly treated the legal burden of proof as resting  on
    the appellant; the other taking issue with  the  judge's  treatment  of
    several aspects of the evidence.

3.   We are  grateful  to  both  representatives  for  their  well-presented
    submissions.

4.   We are persuaded that the first ground is  made  out.   Despite  citing
    the Supreme Court judgment in Sadovska and Another [2017] UKSC 54,  the
    judge failed to follow its guidance as regards the burden of proof.  At
    [28] Lady Hale stated in criticism of the judge in that case that "[i]t
    was not for Ms Sadovska  to  establish  that  the  relationship  was  a
    genuine and lasting one.  It was for the respondent to  establish  that
    it was indeed a marriage of convenience" (see also [31]).  Not only  in
    her formal self-direction at paragraph 4 but also in her  treatment  of
    the issue of the burden at paragraphs 13 and 23,  the  judge  committed
    very much the same error.  At paragraphs 13 and 23 she stated:

         "13. I will  start  with  the  crucial  primary  issue  for  me  to
             determine: whether or not the marriage between  the  appellant
             and the EEA national is a genuine marriage of substance or one
             of convenience. Following  the  decision  in  Papajorgji  (EEA
             spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece  [2012]  UKUT  00038
             (IAC) and Rosa v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 14,  I  ask  myself  the
             following question: in  the  light  of  the  totality  of  the
             information  before  me,  including  the  assessment  of   the
             appellant's  answers  and  any  information  provided,  am   I
             satisfied that it is more probable than not this is a marriage
             of  convenience?  There  is  an  evidential  burden  upon  the
             respondent to justify a reasonable suspicion that  this  is  a
             marriage of convenience and then there rests a burden upon the
             appellant to show on the balance of probabilities that  it  is
             not a marriage of convenience. I further remind myself of  the
             decision of Sadovska & anor v SSHD [2017] UKSC 54.

         ...

         23.   I  find  that  there  is  indeed  substantial   evidence   of
             cohabitation since the decision and of  course  that  they  do
             indeed have child together. However, when looking  at  all  of
             the factors that I have mentioned above and my findings as  to
             appellant's blatant disregard for the immigration laws,  I  do
             not find that they are sufficient to show that this is  indeed
             a genuine marriage. I find that the  evidence  points  towards
             the fact that the  marriage  took  place  in  order  that  the
             appellant could obtain residence in the UK and not  be  forced
             to return to Pakistan. I find that the appellant has not shown
             that this is a genuine marriage."

5.   We do not think the judge's treatment of the burden  of  proof  can  be
    rescued by her reference in paragraph 13 to the evidential burden being
    upon the respondent, (or by her reference  in  paragraph  14  that  the
    respondent has "indeed justified a reasonable  suspicion"),  since  for
    the judge it remained that the appellant bore  the  burden  of  showing
    that it was "not a marriage of convenience".

6.   For similar reasons articulated by  Lady  Hale  in  Sadovska,  we  also
    consider that "it is impossible ... to conclude that,  had  the  matter
    been approached in  the  right  way,  the  decision  relating  to  [the
    appellant] would inevitably have been the same" ([33]).

7.   Had we  been  in  doubt  about  the  material  nature  of  the  judge's
    erroneous treatment of the burden of proof, we would still have decided
    to set aside the judge's decision, since there are  other  shortcomings
    in  the  judge's  treatment  of  the  evidence,  including  a  somewhat
    inaccurate analysis of discrepancies  in  the  evidence  given  by  the
    couple during their marriage interviews regarding  their  child's  age;
    and a failure to address the oral evidence given by the  appellant  and
    his wife with any particularity (given that in the judge's own  view  t
    the respondent had discharged the evidential  burden  by  reference  to
    inconsistencies  in  their  marriage  interviews,   she   should   have
    recognised  that  their  oral  evidence  before  her  was  their   main
    opportunity to explain those inconsistencies).

8.    We  would  emphasise,  however,  that  our  finding  that  the   judge
    materially erred in law in no way suggests a view on the merits of  the
    appellant's case.  It is the intention of the appellant at the time  of
    the marriage that is material (see Rosa v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 14)  and
    prior  to  the  marriage  the  appellant  (according  to  a  report  by
    Immigration Officers who encountered the appellant on 13 December 2013)
    the appellant was seen trying to get back into his car a woman who said
    to them he was trying to pay her ï¿½500 for her to marry him so he  could
    stay in the UK.

9.   In the nature of the judge's errors we see no alternative to  the  case
    being remitted to the FtT to be heard afresh.

10.  To conclude:

    The decision of the FtT Judge is set aside for material error of law;

    The case is remitted to the FtT (not before Judge Nixon).

No anonymity direction is made.
