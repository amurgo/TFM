                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms C Fletcher, Counsel, instructed by WRJ Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 24 June 2018 of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Gurung-Thapa which allowed the appeal of RSD against the
    respondent's decision to deprive him of his British  citizenship  under
    Section 40(3) of the British Nationality Act 1981.

 2. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him or any member of their family.  This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. I make
    this order to avoid serious harm arising for RSD's family  members,  in
    particular his minor child.

 3. For the purposes of this decision I refer to RSD as the  appellant  and
    to the Secretary of State for the Home Department  as  the  respondent,
    reflecting their positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. The background to this matter is that the appellant came to the UK from
    India in 1997 and claimed asylum.  He was  refused  protection  by  the
    respondent but was successful in his appeal and on 17  August  2000  he
    was granted refugee status.  The appellant lodged  an  application  for
    naturalisation as a British  citizen  on  5  January  2004.   This  was
    successful and on 25 August 2004 he became a British citizen.

 5. The police later informed the respondent that  on  10  March  2011  the
    appellant was convicted of 23 counts of sexual  abuse  against  a  male
    child within the family.  The  Certificate  of  Conviction  or  Finding
    outlined that the offences were committed between 2003 and  2010.   The
    appellant began grooming the child in question from the age  of  7  and
    many acts of rape, both anal and oral,  followed.   The  appellant  was
    sentenced to  fourteen  years'  imprisonment  and  placed  on  the  sex
    offenders' register for life.

 6. The respondent referred to Section 40(3) of the British Nationality Act
    1981 (the BNA) which provides as follows:

         "40(3)   The Secretary of State may by order deprive a person of  a
                citizenship status which results from  his  registration  or
                naturalisation if the Secretary of State is  satisfied  that
                the registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of-

                (a)    fraud,

                (b)    false representation, or

                (c)    concealment of a material fact."

 7. The respondent noted that the conviction showed  that  the  appellant's
    offending behaviour had commenced  in  2003,  that  is,  prior  to  the
    naturalisation application made in January 2004.  The  respondent  also
    noted that  where  the  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  information
    concerning his good  character  in  Section  3  of  the  naturalisation
    application form, that section had been  left  blank.   The  respondent
    found as follows in her decision depriving  the  applicant  of  British
    citizenship:

         "10. ... Given the fact that you  began  your  sexual  offences  in
             2003, prior to lodging your  naturalisation  application,  and
             continued to do so many years after you were  granted  British
             citizenship, you were clearly not of good character.   It  was
             only because you concealed your sexual assaults that led (sic)
             to your application succeeding.

         ...

         12.  The naturalisation application  form  and  AN  guidance  notes
             (Annex A  and  B  refer)  explain  that  anything  that  would
             indicate that you were not of good character should have  been
             disclosed.  This  would  have  afforded  the  caseworker  with
             information  directly  relevant  to  the  assessment  of  your
             character.  Rather than tell  the  truth,  you  withheld  your
             involvement in criminal activity.  It is considered that  this
             was a deliberate deception designed  to  deny  the  caseworker
             with  information  that  would,  if  you  had  been  truthful,
             resulted in refusal of your application on character  grounds.
             The deception was therefore material to the decision to  grant
             you citizenship as it resulted in you being assessed as  being
             of good character, when you were not.

         13.  For the reasons given above it is  not  accepted  there  is  a
             plausible, innocent explanation for the misleading information
             which led to the decision to grant  citizenship.   Rather,  on
             the balance of probabilities, it is considered that you failed
             to provide information with the intention of obtaining a grant
             of citizenship in circumstances where your  application  would
             have been unsuccessful if you  had  told  the  truth.   It  is
             therefore  considered  that  the  fraud  was  deliberate   and
             material to the acquisition of British citizenship."

 8. As a result of these matters on 15 February 2018, the  respondent  gave
    notice under Section 40(5) of the British Nationality Act 1981 that  he
    had decided to make an order under Section 40(3).  The  appellant  then
    exercised his right of appeal.  The  appellant's  evidence  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  Section  3   of   the   naturalisation
    application form had been left blank because of inadequate  conduct  of
    his legal advisers. The First-tier  Tribunal  records  the  appellant's
    evidence on this matter as follows in paragraphs 27 to 32:

         "27.  The  appellant  in  examination-in-chief  was  asked  if   he
             completed his naturalisation application form and  he  replied
             it was his solicitor.  He  was  not  able  to  read  or  write
             English at that time.  He was asked if his solicitor told  him
             about the questions in the application form and he replied  he
             does not think so.  He was further asked if his solicitor  had
             asked him certain questions if he would have been able to tell
             whether the questions were from the application form to  which
             the appellant replied no.

         28.  I asked the appellant how his solicitor obtained  the  answers
             contained in the application form and the appellant replied he
             gave the solicitor �500.  I again asked  the  appellant  where
             his  solicitor  obtained  the   answers   contained   in   the
             application form to which the appellant replied the  solicitor
             took �500 off him and he signed it.  I asked the appellant  if
             he asked the solicitor about the questions on the form and  he
             replied he does not think so.  It was  put  to  the  appellant
             that he has not mentioned in his witness  statement  that  the
             previous solicitor did not ask him about the questions on  the
             form to which the appellant replied if a person  is  upset  in
             prison he does not know what he is doing.  It was put  to  the
             appellant that he has made a full page witness  statement  and
             why he made no mention that his solicitor did not ask him  the
             questions on the form to which the appellant replied when  the
             witness statement was taken the  solicitor  did  not  ask  him
             questions relating  to  that.   When  asked  why  he  did  not
             volunteer  the  information  himself,  the  appellant  replied
             sometimes some things don't come in the mind.

         29.  Having carefully gone through the  naturalisation  application
             form I find it reasonable to conclude that only the  appellant
             would have been able to give the information contained in that
             form for example his parents' names and his wife's name  (A2),
             time spent outside the UK (A4) and details about the  referees
             (A5).  I  reject  the  appellant's  claim  that  his  previous
             solicitor did not put the questions to him.

         30.   The  appellant  claims  that  he  is  stateless  because   he
             surrendered his Indian nationality following naturalisation as
             a British citizen [18].  I asked the appellant if he was  able
             to retain his Indian nationality  when  he  became  a  British
             citizen and  he  replied  he  was  not  allowed  to  keep  two
             nationalities.  It was put to him  that  the  UK  allows  dual
             nationality to which the appellant replied when he applied for
             naturalisation his Indian passport was  taken  by  people  who
             gave him the nationality.  The appellant then stated  that  he
             gave the  passport  to  the  solicitor  when  he  applied  for
             naturalisation.  He never got his passport back.  Paragraph 18
             of the appellant's statement was read to him and was asked how
             he surrendered his Indian nationality.  The appellant  replied
             when he applied for British citizenship his passport was given
             to the solicitor and he never  got  his  passport  back.   The
             appellant was asked if he or his  representatives  surrendered
             his Indian nationality to which the appellant replied when  he
             applied for British citizenship he gave his  passport  to  the
             solicitor and not to the Indian Embassy.

         31.  The appellant  confirmed  that  since  the  grant  of  British
             citizenship he has travelled to India at least 2/4 times.

         32.  Given  the  appellant's  overall  credibility,  I  reject  the
             appellant's  claim  that  he  has   surrendered   his   Indian
             nationality.  I find that there is  no  satisfactory  evidence
             before me to suggest that the appellant would be stateless  if
             he is deprived of his British nationality."

 9. The First-tier Tribunal then  went  on  to  consider  the  respondent's
    guidance on the meaning of "false representation" and  "concealment  of
    any material fact" and "fraud" as used  in  s.40(3)  of  the  BNA.   At
    paragraphs 35 to 38 the judge found as follows:

         "35. Mr Jussab submitted that the reference made by the  respondent
             to the AN guide at [11-12] of the refusal letter and  said  to
             be from December 2003 is incorrect  because  sections  in  the
             actual naturalisation application form does not  correlate  to
             the sections of the AN guidance form and gave an example  that
             Section 3 relates to good  character  yet  Section  3  of  the
             guidance form deals with  residence  requirement.   He  stated
             that it cannot be accepted that the respondent  has  submitted
             the correct  guidance  form  that  existed  at  the  time  the
             appellant applied for naturalisation.  I find  that  there  is
             force in Mr Jussab's submission and I also take  note  of  the
             fact that the application form for example the paragraph  just
             before sub-section 3.10 refers  to  paragraphs  40-41  of  the
             guide, yet there are no such paragraphs  in  the  AN  guidance
             form.

         36.  Be that as it may, I find that the critical issue  is  whether
             or not the appellant intended  to  deceive  the  Secretary  of
             State when he submitted  his  naturalisation  application.   I
             accept Mr Jussab's submission that the definitions  given  for
             false representation concealment of any material fact imply  a
             requirement on the appellant's part to intend to  deceive  the
             decision maker but on the basis of the evidence there  was  no
             such intention to deceive.

         37.  Furthermore, the appellant had completely failed  to  complete
             Section 3 which deals with good character (A3-A4).   Not  only
             did the appellant fail to complete sub-section  3.13  he  also
             failed to complete sub-sections 3.10, 3.11  and  3.12.   Given
             the fact that Section  3  on  good  character  had  been  left
             completely blank, I find it reasonable to conclude that it was
             incumbent on the respondent to have returned  the  application
             form asking him to complete Section 3.  There is  no  evidence
             before me to suggest that the respondent had taken this course
             of action and chose to grant the appellant British citizenship
             while the form had not been fully completed.

         38.  I therefore find that the respondent has failed  to  discharge
             the burden of proof pursuant to Section 40(3)."

10. The respondent applied for permission to appeal against the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal setting out the following grounds:

         "In this matter the Secretary of State gave notice of an  intention
         to deprive the Appellant of British citizenship  on  15/2/18.   The
         Secretary of State invoked her  discretion  under  s.40(3)  on  the
         basis that the Appellant, in a 2004 naturalisation application, had
         failed to answer question 3.13  'Have  you  engaged  in  any  other
         activities which might be relevant to the question of  whether  you
         are a person of good character?'.  It was argued that the Appellant
         failed to disclose criminal activity that  occurred  prior  to  the
         date of the application on 5/1/04.  The Appellant was convicted  of
         23 counts of sexual abuse against a male child  within  the  family
         between 2000-2010.  The Appellant was sentenced to  fourteen  years
         and placed on the sexual offenders' register for life.

         At paragraph 26 the FTIJ finds the Appellant was not a  witness  of
         truth and wholly rejects A's assertion that he was unaware  of  the
         questions in the application form because his solicitor did not put
         the questions  to  him  @  29.   The  FTIJ  makes  further  adverse
         credibility findings @ 32 in respect of the  Appellant's  surrender
         of Indian nationality.

         It is submitted  in  light  of  the  Tribunal's  rejection  of  the
         Appellant's 'innocent explanation' for failing to disclose criminal
         acts, the FTIJ finding @ 36 that there was no intention to  deceive
         is inadequately reasoned and unsustainable.  It is  submitted  that
         the reasoning @ 37 that the whole of the good character section was
         blank fails to engage with the finding at  paragraph  29  that  the
         solicitor put the questions in the form to  the  Appellant.   There
         was no explanation as to why then Section 3 remained blank.

         It is submitted in light of these findings and  the  rejected  case
         advanced by the Appellant, the FTIJ's finding  that  there  was  no
         evidence  of  intention  to  deceive  was  perverse;  no   rebuttal
         explanation for the failure to answer question 3.13 was accepted by
         the Tribunal."

11. In my judgment, it is correct, as argued in the grounds of appeal, that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is irrational.   The  threshold
    for such a finding is high but made out here. The finding in paragraphs
    26 to 29 that the appellant was untruthful as to why Section 3  of  the
    form on his good character was not completed is irreconcilable with the
    finding in paragraph 36 that there was  no  intention  to  deceive  the
    decision maker.  It is undisputed that the offending behaviour began in
    2003.  It is  unarguable  that  this  was  behaviour  that  was  highly
    relevant to the good character assessment  and  there  is  no  credible
    explanation for the appellant failing to  declare  it.   There  was  no
    obligation on the respondent to revert to the appellant  or  his  legal
    advisors in 2004 asking for him to complete Section 3 as  suggested  in
    paragraph 37 of the First-Tier Tribunal's decision.

12. For these reasons I am satisfied that the decision  of  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal on whether the appellant used fraud or  concealed  a  material
    fact and therefore whether s.40(3) of the  BNA  was  made  out  can  be
    properly characterised  as  irrational,  notwithstanding  the  elevated
    threshold for such a finding. Having reached that  conclusion,  I  must
    set aside the decision to be re-made.

13. The appellant's argument on why he  cannot  be  found  to  come  within
    s.40(3) is as follows. When he completed the form in 2004  it  was  not
    his view that he had committed a  criminal  offence  and  therefore  he
    could not reasonably have been expected to be  aware  of  the  need  to
    declare his conduct.  He could only have been expected to declare  what
    had happened after he was convicted in 2011.  Until then he  had  never
    considered himself to have been committing an offence or to be  guilty.
    He therefore did not have the  requisite  intention  to  use  fraud  or
    conceal a material fact.

14. I do not accept that argument.  The naturalisation application form  is
    contained in the respondent's bundle.  On pages A3-A4 the  requirements
    of Section 3 on good character are set out.  It states:

         "In this section you need to give information which will  help  the
         Home Secretary to decide whether he can be satisfied that  you  are
         of good character.  Checks will be made with the  police  and  your
         referees will also be asked later on in this form to  confirm  that
         you are of good character."

15. On A4 of the respondent's bundle the form shows that the appellant  was
    asked to answer the following question:

         "3.13    Have you engaged in any other activities  which  might  be
                relevant to the question of whether you are a person of good
                character?"

16. In the box above paragraph 3.13 the appellant was advised as follows:

         "You must  disclose  details  of  any  activities  which  might  be
         relevant to the question of  whether  you  are  a  person  of  good
         character (see paras. 40-41 in the Guide).  You must  answer  'YES'
         or 'NO' to the following questions.  If you answer 'YES', you  must
         give full details on a separate sheet of paper."

17. The reference to the relevant paragraphs of  the  guide  appear  to  be
    incorrect but the appellant can be expected to  have  referred  to  the
    full guidance which, as shown on page B9 of  the  respondent's  bundle,
    advised as follows:

         "You must say whether you have  been  involved  in  anything  which
         might indicate that you are not of good character.  You  must  give
         information about any of these activities no matter  how  long  ago
         this was.  Checks will be made in all cases  and  your  application
         may fail and your fee will not be fully refunded  if  you  make  an
         untruthful declaration.  If you are in any doubt about whether  you
         have done something or it has  been  alleged  that  you  have  done
         something which might lead us to think that you  are  not  of  good
         character you should say so."

18. For the respondent, Mr Clarke referred to  the  definition  of  whether
    someone has acted dishonestly in the case of  Ivey  v  Genting  Casinos
    (UK) Limited [2017] UKSC 67.  At [74] the Supreme Court say this:

         "When dishonesty is in  question  the  fact-finding  Tribunal  must
         first ascertain (subjectively) the actual state of the individual's
         knowledge or  belief  as  to  the  facts.   The  reasonableness  or
         otherwise of his belief is a matter of evidence (often in  practice
         determinative) going to whether he held the belief, but it  is  not
         an additional requirement that his belief must be  reasonable;  the
         question is whether it is genuinely held.   When  once  his  actual
         state of mind as to knowledge or belief as to facts is established,
         the question whether his conduct was honest or dishonest is  to  be
         determined by the fact-finder by applying the (objective) standards
         of ordinary decent  people.   There  is  no  requirement  that  the
         defendant must appreciate that  what  he  has  done  is,  by  those
         standards, dishonest."

19. The appellant's explanation for failing to answer any of the  questions
    in the application form on good character has not been found  credible.
    The application form, even  without  the  guidance  document,  made  it
    entirely clear to the appellant that the question of good character did
    not relate only to formal criminal convictions. That  alone  undermines
    his claim that he did not include his behaviour on the  basis  that  he
    was not aware in 2004 that it was criminal. It is, in  any  event,  not
    credible against any standard that he had a genuine  belief  that  that
    grooming and sexually assaulting a child were not matters  relevant  to
    the good  character  declarations  he  was  required  to  make  in  the
    naturalisation  application.  The  only  rational  conclusion  on   the
    evidence here is that he  deliberately  failed  to  complete  the  good
    character sections of the form when he could only but have  known  that
    this aspect of his behaviour was material.

20. The appellant's case therefore fails on the first limb of the test  set
    down by the Supreme Court in Ivey. It is not accepted  that  he  had  a
    genuine belief in 2004 that he was not required to declare that he  was
    grooming a child. On the contrary, my view of the evidence is  that  he
    concealed his behaviour, knowing that it would lead  to  a  refusal  of
    naturalisation and, very likely, to criminal proceedings.

21.  It  is  therefore  my   conclusion   that   the   appellant   obtained
    naturalisation in 2004 by deliberately concealing material  facts.  The
    respondent therefore  acted  correctly  in  depriving  him  of  British
    nationality, relying on s.40(3) of the BNA. I  re-make  the  appeal  as
    refused.

22. For completeness sake, I should point out  that  it  has  already  been
    conceded for the appellant that Article 8 ECHR is not engaged here; see
    paragraph 41 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses error on a  point  of
    law and is set aside.

24. I remake the appeal as refused.
