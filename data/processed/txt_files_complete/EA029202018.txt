For the respondent:    Mr. A McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

   1. The appellant has permission to appeal the decision of First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Chudleigh's decision promulgated on 25th June 2018. The
      appeal was against the respondent's refusal to issue her with a
      residence card to confirm she was a family member of an EEA national
      exercising Treaty rights.

   2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria. Her application was on the
      basis she was married to Mr [SA], an Austrian national exercising
      Treaty rights. He is originally from Nigeria and they married by proxy
      in Nigeria in a customary marriage on 29 August 2017. The marriage was
      registered on 11 September 2017 at a local government office in
      Nigeria.

   3. She provided a letter from his employer, stating his employment began
      on 9 January 2017 and his annual salary was ï¿½19,000. Wage slips and
      bank statements were included. The appellant was pregnant at the time
      and NHS documentation was provided.

   4. With the application she included her sponsor's Austrian passport,
      number [~].

   5. The application was refused on 21 March 2018. The respondent said that
      the passport submitted had been reported lost on 20 June 2017. Her
      application was refused as she had not provided either a valid
      national passport or identity card to show her sponsor was a European
      national. The passport submitted was returned.

   6. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal stated that the
      sponsor had reported his passport as missing on 20 June 2017, as the
      respondent's records confirm. He then obtained a new passport. He
      subsequently found his original passport which was the one submitted.

   7. The appeal was to be heard on the papers and on 8 June 2018 was
      assigned to First-tier Judge Chudley. At paragraph 2 the judge records
      that the passport originally reported as lost had been submitted with
      the application. The judge at paragraph 6 concluded the appellant had
      failed to produce a valid passport and therefore the respondent was
      right to refuse the application. The judge points out that the
      appellant acknowledges the passport submitted was the one originally
      thought to be lost.

The Upper Tribunal

   8. The application for permission to the Upper Tribunal states that the
      appellant sent a copy of her husband's new passport. She meantime had
      her baby and a copy of the baby's birth certificate was also sent.

   9. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the documentation
      referred to, particularly the new passport, was not before the court.
      Had this information been available it may have made a material
      difference and affected the fairness of the proceedings.

  10. Mr. McVeety did not oppose the appeal. He stated that he had seen the
      new passport. There were no issues about the relationship or the
      sponsor's employment. Consequently, he saw no reason why I should not
      remake the decision and allow the appeal. Mr Aberwusi said the
      documents had been sent and could not explain why they were not before
      the First tier Judge.

Consideration

  11. A potential complication is that this is a proxy marriage. If the
      appellant is married to her sponsor then she is an immediate family
      member rather than the extended family member. In the latter case she
      normally would have been required to show 2 years cohabitation. The
      evidence in the file in respect of this is limited.

  12. Awuku v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 178
      stated in the law of England and Wales the general rule is that the
      formal validity of a marriage is governed by the law of the country
      where the marriage was celebrated. A marriage by proxy will be treated
      as valid in England if recognised by the local law. The Court of
      Appeal disagreed with Kareem (Proxy marriages - EU law) [2014] UKUT
      00024 (IAC) which had referred to the law of the Member State of the
      EU national's nationality.

  13. The refusal raised only on one ground, namely that the appellant had
      not provided evidence in the approved form of her husband's EEA
      nationality. His passport has now been produced and Mr McVeety has
      seen this. He has raised no other objection to the application. The
      passport produced confirms her husband's the nationality. For an
      unknown reason this was not placed before the judge. Had it been is
      likely the outcome would have been different.

  14. There is a letter dated 11 September 2017 from the customary court in
      Nigeria stating that the marriage is recognised in accordance with
      Nigeria law. The marriage therefore appears valid in Nigeria.

  15.  Consequently, the evidence indicates the appellant is entitled to the
      documentation she seeks.

Decision

  16. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chudleigh materially errs in
      law. This is because a decision was made in ignorance of the fact that
      the appellant's sponsor had been issued with a new passport and for
      reasons unknown this was not passed onto the court. I remake the
      decision allowing the appeal.
