               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:    Ms H Foot, instructed by Wilson Solicitors LLP

For the Respondent:   Mr T Lindsay, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The appellant is a Portuguese citizen who appealed against the decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  his   appeal   against   the
    respondent's decision to remove him to Portugal pursuant to  Regulation
    21 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (as
    amended). The deportation order was signed on 15 July 2010.

 2. The reason why the appeal was remitted was that, following the judgment
    of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Secretary of State for
    the Home Department v MG (Judgment of the Court) [2014] EUECJ C-400/12,
    Judge Moulden's decision that the appellant had  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom for more than 10 years before the making  of  the  decision  to
    remove him on 15 July 2010, was incorrect.  The appellant was in prison
    from 2008-2011 and MG held that:

             "2.       Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive  2004/38  must   be
             interpreted as meaning that a period of  imprisonment  is,  in
             principle, capable both of interrupting the continuity of  the
             period of residence for the purposes of that provision and  of
             affecting the decision regarding the  grant  of  the  enhanced
             protection provided for  thereunder,  even  where  the  person
             concerned resided in the host Member State for  the  10  years
             prior to imprisonment. However,  the  fact  that  that  person
             resided in the host Member State for the  10  years  prior  to
             imprisonment may be taken into consideration as  part  of  the
             overall assessment required in order to determine whether  the
             integrating links previously forged with the host Member State
             have been broken."

 3. Before the Court of Appeal, both parties agreed that on the facts,  the
    correct test to be applied to this appellant  was  that  in  Regulation
    21(3) (serious grounds of public policy or public security) rather than
    the 'imperative grounds' test in Regulation 21(4).   In  remitting  the
    appeal, the Court of Appeal limited the issues as follows:

              "...    2.   The appeal is hereby allowed  to  the  following
             extent:

                  (1)  The decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Moulden  is  set
                  aside save that his findings of fact are to be preserved.
                  (2)   The  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
                  Immigration and Asylum Chamber for re-hearing.
                  (3)  The parties if  they  so  wish  to  serve  up-to-date
                  evidence, directions to be agreed and
                   (4)   Absent  special  circumstances,  the  hearing   and
                  judgment  is  to  be  restricted   to   consideration   of
                  Regulation 21(3) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
                  Area) Regulations 2006 and Article 8 of  the  ECHR  which,
                  for the  avoidance  of  doubt  is  now  to  be  determined
                  pursuant to part 5A of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
                  Asylum Act 2002."

Upper Tribunal hearing

 4. The appeal came before me for a substantive hearing on 16 December 2015
    on that basis.  No additional evidence had been served.    However,  at
    the  hearing,  the  appellant  produced  and  sought  to  rely  upon  a
    substantial amount of additional material, and I adjourned,  to  enable
    the respondent  to  take  account  of  that  material,  which  had  not
    previously been relied upon. The costs of the 16 December 2015  hearing
    were reserved.

The preserved findings

 5. Judge Moulden found the following facts: although he did not  expressly
    say so, it is clear that  he  treated  the  appellant  and  his  former
    partner as credible witnesses. Judge  Moulden  had  the  benefit  of  a
    medico-legal report from Dr Tom Lavender BSc, MSc, MB ChB  MRCPsych,  a
    consultant psychiatrist, who also provided an updated  report  for  the
    hearing before me some 3 years later.

 6. The appellant is a Portuguese citizen who arrived in the United Kingdom
    in 2000 age 24 and an EEA citizen.   He  is  now  40  years  old.   The
    appellant lived in Portugal, mostly with his mother, from his birth  in
    1976 until he arrived in the United Kingdom on 13 February  2000,  aged
    24.  He still speaks fluent Portuguese.  His mother is white Portuguese
    and his father is black Angolan so he is mixed race.  He  has  not  had
    any contact with his father since soon after he was born.   He  has  no
    known family in Angola. His mother is now in a  new  relationship,  and
    the appellant has a stepfather and stepbrother who live in East Anglia.
     The appellant has no close relatives in Portugal.

 7. The appellant has Hepatitis C, for which he  takes  no  treatment.   He
    sustained a twisting injury to his right knee in April 2004, for  which
    he has had two operations.  Upper Tribunal Judge Moulden was  satisfied
    that between April 2004 and December 2005 the appellant  was  a  person
    temporarily unable to work as a result of an illness  or  accident.  No
    other health problems were relied  upon.   Between  2000  -  2004,  the
    appellant  worked  intermittently  for  Empire  World  Trade  Ltd   and
    Guarantees, and  also  for  Spalding  Staff  Service.   No  documentary
    evidence was produced suggesting that the appellant worked after  2004.
    He had worked, at most, for 4ï¿½ years.

 8. The appellant has a large number of criminal  convictions,  mostly  for
    drug-related offences, beginning in October 2002, including breaches of
    various court orders, assaulting  police,  disorderly  and  threatening
    behaviour. In December 2008, the appellant was convicted  of  supplying
    class A drugs, for which he was  sentenced  to  a  total  of  4  years'
    imprisonment,  which  included  concurrent  sentences  for   additional
    offences of possession of Class A and Class C  drugs  and  supplying  a
    Class A drug committed while he was on bail.   That  was  the  sentence
    which triggered the decision to remove him to Portugal.

 9. During his prison sentence, the appellant breached the discipline rules
    in prison for drugs matters and making 'hooch' alcohol in his cell:  he
    had quite a few adjudications at the beginning of his  sentence.  While
    in  prison,  the  appellant  gained  certificates  of  Food  Safety  in
    Catering, Health and Safety in the  Workplace,  Forklift  Truck,  Adult
    Literacy, and a Level 1 Key Skills certificate 'Working with Others'.

10. The appellant is the father of a daughter born on  29  September  2002,
    although his name is not on the birth certificate.   His  daughter  was
    born from a relationship with a British citizen  (his  former  partner)
    lasting several years.  The appellant  and  his  former  partner  lived
    together  as  a  family  for  a  time,  until  the  partner  lost   her
    accommodation and had to move in with her own parents. The relationship
    was not an easy  one,  with  both  partners  taking  drugs,  a  chaotic
    lifestyle, and allegations of domestic violence  to  which  the  police
    were frequently called.

11. The appellant's daughter has behavioural problems, both at  school  and
    at home.  She is one of a small minority of mixed race children in  her
    area, and they have a strong emotional tie. It was  accepted  by  Judge
    Moulden that family life existed between the appellant,  his  daughter,
    and his former partner. The  appellant's  former  partner  has  another
    child, an older boy, with whom the appellant had a good relationship.

12. Just before Judge Moulden considered the appeal in  October  2013,  the
    relationship between the appellant and his former partner  ended.   The
    appellant's daughter was the  subject  of  a  court  order  as  to  her
    residence:   she  was  living  with  her  mother   and   her   maternal
    grandparents, not far from where the appellant lived.   The appellant's
    daughter had behavioural difficulties and could be disruptive.  She was
    on an individual education plan, and was making progress.

13. The appellant's former partner had in the  past  used  drugs  and  that
    presented challenges.  Their relationship was troubled at times (Dr Tom
    Lavender in his medico-legal report described it as 'tempestuous').  On
    a particular occasion, the police were called to what appeared to be  a
    domestic violence incident, although his former partner explained  that
    the appellant had only smashed property in the home.

14. The appellant was often asked by his former partner to step in and deal
    with his daughter's challenging behaviour.  They were able to cooperate
    and agree on the arrangements for their daughter.

Upper Tribunal hearing

15. The appeal came  before  me  for  hearing  on  13  October  2016.   The
    appellant disclosed an offence of resisting or obstructing a  constable
    in the execution of his duty, committed on 25 May 2016,  for  which  he
    had received a 6 months' conditional discharge and was ordered to pay a
    ï¿½20 fine.    The  appellant's  solicitors  produced  a  bundle  of  620
    documents. They also  served  an  updated  witness  statement  for  the
    appellant,  dealing  with  the  May  2016  offence,  and   an   updated
    psychiatric report and risk assessment from Dr Lavender,  a  consultant
    forensic psychiatrist, who also  provided  a  report  for  the  hearing
    before Judge Moulden.  That, together with the  oral  evidence  of  the
    appellant and his current partner, was the additional  evidence  before
    me, reflecting the changes in the appellant's situation since the facts
    found by Judge Moulden in October 2013.

Evidence

16. I heard oral evidence from the appellant, and from his current partner.
     The relationship between the appellant and his current  partner  began
    in 2012 but does not appear to  have  been  relied  upon  before  Judge
    Moulden because it was then a very new relationship,  although  it  was
    mentioned in Dr Lavender's report which was before Judge Moulden  then.
    The appellant's former partner gave evidence before Judge Moulden.

Dr Tom Lavender

17. Dr Lavender's original report of 28 August 2013 was relied upon  before
    Judge Moulden and is set out in his decision.  It  forms  part  of  the
    factual assessment by Judge Moulden and, save where it differs from his
    evidence now, I do not need to set out the contents of that report.  Dr
    Lavender saw the appellant on 30 July 2016 to prepare a report dated 30
    July 2016, which was before me at the hearing.  The appellant's current
    partner came  to  the  appointment  but  did  not  join  them  for  the
    interview. Dr Lavender noted that the appellant was neatly dressed, and
    pleasant and polite throughout the interview.

18. Dr Lavender reported that both of the appellant's parents  (his  mother
    and stepfather) were alive and  now  living  in  Cleveland,  where  the
    appellant also lived with his  current  partner.   His  stepfather  had
    benefited from the insertion of a pacemaker, and was retired and living
    on a pension.  His mother had some minor physical  ailments,  including
    leg swelling, but did not require day-to-day support from others.   His
    stepbrother lived nearby with his own partner, and  the  appellant  saw
    him regularly.  His stepbrother worked in gardening  and  paving  work:
    sometimes, the appellant helped out. Although  the  appellant  was  now
    living separately from his mother and stepfather, they  remained  close
    and he saw his mother regularly.

19. The appellant explained why he had moved away  to  Cleveland.   He  was
    well known in his former home area, where he felt pressure to slip back
    into his old habits of selling  drugs,  though  he  had  not  done  so.
    People there knew he had been to jail, and he wanted a fresh start.  It
    was further from his daughter, but when she came to stay, once a month,
    she was away from her mother and friends, and they  had  more  time  to
    spend together.

20. The appellant told Dr Lavender that he  had  been  seeing  his  current
    partner since 2013.  When he first met his current partner, she was  in
    a vulnerable situation, with people targeting her  to  get  money  from
    her.  She would forget or choose not to  attend  medical  appointments.
    On one occasion, she had a long telephone conversation  with  her  late
    brother in the Italian language, although he was  dead.  The  appellant
    realised that his partner was  very  unwell  and  was  instrumental  in
    getting her admitted to hospital.  The appellant's partner  now  had  a
    diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder and personality disorder,  such
    that she needed high levels of daily support and suffered episodes when
    her mental health significantly deteriorated.

21. The appellant was his partner's paid carer, receiving  ï¿½63  a  week  in
    addition to his partner's employment  support  allowance  and  personal
    independence payment.  They were managing, and he had paid off all  his
    outstanding  debts.   As  his  partner's  carer,  the   appellant   was
    responsible for looking after her money and  financial  affairs,  doing
    the shopping and budgeting, and giving her medication, which he kept in
    a locked cabinet to which only he had the key.  She had on one occasion
    overdosed and become very drowsy; left to herself,  his  partner  would
    take  too  much,  or  too  little  of  her  medication,  or  forget  it
    altogether. The appellant's parents had been a  good  support  for  his
    partner: she relied on her relationships with them and with him, having
    lost all of her own close family.   She gave the appellant a  sense  of
    purpose, making him feel worth something.   He feared that if  he  were
    deported, his partner might  well  need  to  be  moved  into  supported
    accommodation.

22. The  appellant's  daughter  would  turn  14  in  September  2016.   She
    continued to have behavioural difficulties, including aggression, lying
    and stealing.  He was still  very  involved  in  assisting  his  former
    partner to manage their daughter's behaviour.  She had hit  her  mother
    and her grandmother in the past.   She  had  dyspraxia,  and  had  been
    assessed by the local child mental health services. The  appellant  and
    his former partner remained  good  friends  and  cooperated  well.   He
    maintained some contact with his former partner's son, as well.

23. He had a good relationship with his current partner and  his  daughter,
    and all his family were here. The appellant is  Hepatitis  C  positive,
    asymptomatic, and has not sought treatment.  He  still  needed  further
    surgery on his left leg after the  previous  two  operations.   He  was
    otherwise in good physical health.  The appellant told Dr Lavender that
    he had no arrests, cautions, or convictions since  2013.   Dr  Lavender
    had seen no police documents to contradict that assertion.

24. The appellant was taking Buprenorphine daily (a  heroin  blocker  drug)
    and had been doing so for 3 years.  He had begun taking this medication
    in prison, having previously been on Methadone (a  heroin  replacement)
    since 2002.  He had tried to reduce his dose by himself, but  that  was
    unsuccessful, so his medication was monitored by  his  general  medical
    practitioner. The appellant still used cannabis 'very occasionally' but
    did not consider this a risk factor for  return  to  heroin  use.   The
    appellant had smoked one bag of heroin in 2015,  when  he  learned  the
    respondent was appealing the positive decision  he  had  received  from
    Judge Moulden.  Before that, he had been clean for a long time: had the
    appellant wished to use drugs, he could have done so at any  time,  but
    he did not want to do so, as he had no desire to be deported or go back
    to prison.

25. The appellant felt 'strong' and able to resist  drugs  at  the  moment.
    The appellant said that, apart from occasionally  smoking  cannabis  or
    having a small amount of alcohol, he had not used  any  other  kind  of
    drugs (cocaine, or legal highs) since Dr Lavender saw him in 2013.   He
    drank alcohol approximately once a week, in small  quantities:  he  had
    never been a heavy drinker. He knew nobody in his new home area who was
    a heroin user, and nobody except his doctors  knew  that  he  had  used
    heroin previously.

26. The appellant said he was very worried about the hearing and the result
    for EEA nationals of the European Union referendum; he had  experienced
    two previous episodes of reactive depression.  If deported, he  worried
    that he would not manage in Portugal, as he had no  savings,  would  be
    unable to visit the United Kingdom, and did not  know  where  he  would
    live.  He was sleeping poorly, playing computer  games  late  into  the
    night and catching just a few hours' sleep  for  several  nights,  then
    sleeping for a long period every few days, to  catch  up.   He  had  no
    suicidal plans or ideation, though sometimes he thought  life  was  not
    worth living.

27. Dr Lavender then went through all of the factors he had  considered  in
    his 2013 report.  He considered that  the  position  was  significantly
    better than it had been when the appellant had been in  a  relationship
    with his former partner, a known drug user with whom the appellant  had
    a tempestuous relationship.

28. Dr Lavender's conclusion was that the appellant's risk  of  reoffending
    now was low, and his risk of serious harm to others was also low.   The
    core of his report begins at paragraph 13.2:

         "...as previously outlined, [the appellant's] past offending was  a
         function of his heroin-dependence, and therefore it is his level of
         risk of a relapse into drug-dependence that determines his level of
         risk of general reoffending. In considering his risk, I have  again
         weighed up his positive, protective factors against identified risk
         factors.  Key positive factors  are  that  [the  appellant]  has  a
         stable accommodation and financial situation, a  close  and  strong
         family  network,  ongoing  regular  contact  with  and  a  part  in
         parenting his daughter, and a relationship with his  partner  that,
         whilst not without challenges, provides him stability, support  and
         a meaningful caring role.  His employment  situation  has  changed,
         but he continues to be engaged in constructive work, and developing
         future work plans.

         It is also positive to note that [the appellant] has also acted  to
         address risk factors that  existed  at  the  time  of  my  previous
         assessment; most significantly by moving to a completely  different
         area of the country, and attempting to dissociate himself  entirely
         from his previous  drug-using  existence,  to  the  extent  of  not
         disclosing this information to new  acquaintances.   His  financial
         situation appears to have stabilised since  the  time  of  my  last
         assessment, and his chronic pain issues appear manageable,  and  do
         not appear to have increased his risk  of  drug-relapse  thus  far.
         ...

         [The appellant] briefly  fell  back  on  a  previous  dysfunctional
         coping strategy of using heroin to numb his  emotional  pain  [when
         the Home Office decided to appeal against his allowed appeal].   At
         this point his ongoing connection with [his  previous  home  area],
         while necessary to maintain his  relationship  with  his  daughter,
         allowed availability of drugs through previous acquaintances.   His
         Buprenorphine medication was insufficient to prevent his use, as he
         avoided  taking  his  medication  that  day,  although   it   could
         conceivably have reduced his risk of  slipping  into  a  full-blown
         relapse.  This assessment,  if  correct,  would  suggest  that  the
         future potential events that might be anticipated  to  present  the
         highest risk to [the appellant] would be  ones  that  threaten  his
         close  relationships,  such  as  a  deportation  decision,  or  the
         breakdown or loss of one of his closest relationships.  A  decision
         to deport [the appellant] by severing or severely  restricting  his
         ongoing relationships with his partner, parents and daughter, would
         in my opinion be the one  factor  that  would  be  most  likely  to
         trigger a full relapse into drug use."

Appellant's evidence

29. The appellant adopted his latest witness statement  and  all  preceding
    statements as true and asked that  they  stand  as  part  of  his  oral
    evidence to the Upper Tribunal.  His witness  statements  of  1  August
    2011 was taken into account in the findings of Judge Moulden and  I  do
    not need to recite it here.

30. The appellant made a further statement on 14 December 2015, on which he
    relied, together with a supplementary statement dealing with  the  2016
    offence. In his statement of 14 December, taken by telephone by Jennine
    Walker  from  Wilson  Solicitors  LLP,  the  appellant  set   out   his
    immigration and criminal history.  He explains that he was advised that
    his new relationship with his current partner should not  be  mentioned
    before Judge Moulden because she had only moved in with him  in  summer
    2013 and 'I was advised the relationship would not have made much of  a
    difference to my appeal at that time'.  It was now 2  years  later  and
    the relationship was serious, so he proceeded to give details of it.

31. The appellant said that his current partner had  bipolar  disorder  and
    needed daily medication, which he was responsible for  helping  her  to
    take.  If  he  did  not  prompt  his  partner,  she  would  forget  her
    medication, and become unwell very quickly.  She was last  admitted  to
    hospital in 2013, before they moved in together. His partner  could  be
    'thinking too much sometimes and forgets to  do  things':   she  needed
    prompting for self-care, such as cooking food for herself.  His partner
    had no family, except a stepbrother who the appellant  had  never  met.
    He had been receiving carer's allowance for his care  for  his  partner
    for about 18 months by December 2015 (so from about June 2014).

32. The statement dealt also with the  appellant's  relationship  with  his
    former partner and with his daughter.  The relationship with his former
    partner began at the end of 2001, but they broke up  briefly  in  2002,
    while she was pregnant with their daughter,  born  in  September  2002.
    In 2006, the child was taken from  her  parents  and  placed  with  his
    former partner's parents, under a Family Court  Residence  Order.   The
    appellant's partner lived close by.

33. The appellant admitted in his statement that his  lifestyle,  and  drug
    taking, and that of his former partner became really out of control  at
    this time.  Their daughter was in a  chaotic  situation  and  developed
    behavioural problems, which persist. The appellant felt at least partly
    responsible for his daughter's behavioural problems, which he blamed on
    his not being there for her, and on his drug use. As at December  2015,
    she continued  to  have  had  occasional  problems  at  school,  which,
    although less frequent, were more serious when they arose.  He and  his
    former partner tried  to  present  an  united  front,  and  manage  her
    behaviour together.

34. The appellant said he Saw his daughter every  day  before  he  went  to
    prison, but that while he was in prison, his daughter thought that  the
    appellant was working away from home.  He spoke to her regularly on the
    telephone and they also wrote letters. After his release,  he  saw  his
    daughter, and his stepson (her half-brother) daily, as they  all  lived
    close together.  He would pick her up from  school  and  take  her  out
    sometimes.  He was trying to make up for lost time.

35. The relationship between the appellant and his stepson had become  more
    distant since the appellant had his new relationship; the  boy  was  16
    years old now and had his own father,  but  the  appellant  still  sent
    birthday money and presents, and talked to the boy over Skype,  and  on
    the telephone.

36. As at December 2015, the appellant  said  he  had  not  reoffended  and
    remained drug free.  (However, he now admits one episode of drug use in
    2015).  He was seeing his daughter, now 13 years old, regularly on  one
    weekend a month, and for longer periods  during  the  school  holidays.
    His daughter, his family, and his current  partner  were  his  priority
    now.  His mother and his stepfather were living with the appellant  and
    his current partner in a big 3-bedroom house.  He shared  a  room  with
    his partner; his parents had one room, and his daughter had  the  other
    bedroom, when she came to stay.

37. In his witness statement of 13 October 2016, the appellant  dealt  with
    his having used heroin on one occasion in 2015.  He said  that  he  had
    done so in September 2015, after  the  Court  of  Appeal  remitted  the
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal. The appellant made this error because  he
    was 'crushed' that the matter had returned to the  Upper  Tribunal  for
    hearing again, leaving him in limbo with no certainty as to his  life's
    direction.   He was under extreme stress and made a bad  decision.   He
    had been due to see his daughter, in his former home area, on a Friday,
    but he woke up and made a snap decision to go a day early, buy a bag of
    heroin, and smoke it.  He skipped his medication for the day.

38. The next day, the appellant took his anti-heroin medication and went to
    see his daughter, feeling lucid and sober.  He quickly realised he  had
    made a bad judgment call.  He was frustrated to have had that moment of
    weakness, feeling ashamed that he had let his family down.  He told  Dr
    Lavender about it, and why he believed that  the  situation  would  not
    recur.

39. The statement deals also with the recent  charge  for  obstructing  the
    police in the execution of their duty.  His current partner received  a
    visit from two police officers, following up a report that his  partner
    had bags stolen on that day in 'early/mid June 2016'.  When the  police
    officers arrived, they told the appellant's partner that there  was  an
    old outstanding warrant for her arrest on a shop lifting offence.   The
    appellant's partner became extremely anxious and upset,  and  desperate
    for his help.

40. The appellant told the police officer that he was his partner's  carer,
    presenting all the documents they had to  confirm  his  status  as  his
    partner's recognised carer.  He told them that his partner  had  mental
    health problems, and that he wished to give her  the  medication  which
    was due, and remain with her, to help keep her calm.  He  asked  for  a
    few minutes alone to reassure his partner, but the officers refused and
    the  situation  became  more  fraught.   The  officers  refused.    The
    appellant raised his voice, and his partner continued distressed.  More
    police officers were called and they were both removed from their  home
    and taken, separately, to the police station.  The appellant's  partner
    still had not had her medication.

41. The appellant was charged with obstruction and sent home, after about 2
    hours.  He pleaded guilty at  the  hearing  on  4  July  2016,  with  a
    Collection Order for ï¿½20, which he paid, in full and  on  time.   There
    was no order for costs or custodial sentence.

42. The appellant's partner was kept in the station overnight.  She pleaded
    guilty  to  the  shoplifting  offence  at  the  Magistrates  Court  the
    following day, although she did not remember  taking  the  goods.   The
    appellant finally gave his partner her medication; in  the  short  time
    she had been without it, her auditory  hallucinations  had  reappeared,
    and she had been unable to sleep. That was why he had pushed so hard to
    be allowed to give the medication to her.  The appellant apologised for
    concealing  this  incident  and  his  subsequent  conviction  from   Dr
    Lavender.  He had told his immigration solicitor after  the  conviction
    in July 2016.   He was very sorry for his involvement in the incident.

43.  After  adopting  his  statements,  the  appellant   was   asked   some
    supplementary questions by his Counsel.   He corrected an error in  his
    witness statement: he had been arrested in  May  2016,  not  June.   He
    stated that it had been his decision to move to Lincolnshire, away from
    his daughter's home. The  appellant  visited  his  daughter  every  5-6
    weeks, spending the weekend with her mother, his former  partner.   His
    daughter also came to see the appellant in  school  holidays.  She  had
    spent the last two Christmases  and  New  Year's  Eves  with  him.  His
    mother, stepfather and brother lived with  the  appellant  in  his  new
    home, and he had no relatives in Portugal.

44. He had told his present solicitors about his latest offence,  a  couple
    of weeks after seeing Dr Lavender. In July 2016 he had pleaded  guilty,
    albeit reluctantly. The appellant said that he had not realised that he
    had been conditionally discharged for that offence, or that the ï¿½20  he
    had been ordered to pay was not a fine.    He  did  remember  that  the
    Judge told him not to commit any more offences.

45. The appellant had told Dr Lavender that in 2015, he relapsed  and  took
    heroin again.  He said he had not done so since then.   Asked  why  the
    Tribunal should believe  that  he  had  not  taken  heroin  again,  the
    appellant said that he had no need to tell the doctor what he had  done
    and this should be evidence that he was 'clean' now.

46. In December 2015 the appellant had  begun  a  painting  and  decorating
    course.  He had completed Level 1 but had not continued onto the  Level
    2 course because of the immigration problems he was  having.   Once  he
    had finished the litigation, he would complete his course.  He had felt
    the need to spend more time with his current partner  who  was  unwell,
    which had also been a factor in not continuing.

47. The appellant was now living at an address  in  Lincolnshire  with  his
    current partner.  They lived together, just the two of  them.   It  was
    put  to  the  appellant  that  the  respondent   considered   his   new
    relationship to be a significant present risk factor in  terms  of  his
    committing further offences, but the appellant said that the  May  2016
    offence had come about because he was trying to look after his  current
    partner, to give her medication when the police were arresting her.

48. His partner's twin brother had been using drugs and had died of a  drug
    overdose.  She had to go to court as a witness,  because  somebody  had
    caused her twin's death on purpose.  His partner's father  then  hanged
    himself, and her mother died  of  a  heart  attack.   After  that,  his
    partner deteriorated.  She moved  from  Slough  to  Cleveland  under  a
    witness protection scheme, and the appellant met her there. His partner
    had a stepbrother, and the appellant had spoken  to  him  once  on  the
    telephone, but he had never met him.  His  understanding  was  that  in
    reality, his current partner had nobody but the appellant  on  whom  to
    depend.

49. If the appellant were returned to Portugal,  he  would  have  to  start
    again there.  Portuguese was his first language and he  confirmed  that
    he still spoke that language.  The appellant did not know what he would
    do in Portugal.  He might be 'kind of homeless' and he worried that  he
    might return to drug use. If the appellant were deported, he considered
    that his current partner would  'crack  up  a  bit'  at  first  and  go
    downhill again.

50.  In  cross-examination,  the  appellant  was  asked  about  his  recent
    conviction.  He had been legally represented by a duty  solicitor,  not
    his immigration solicitors.  He maintained that  he  had  'not  really'
    been  aware  that  the  outcome  of  the  proceedings  was  a   6-month
    conditional discharge.  The appellant explained that he  did  not  feel
    guilty of the offence, although he had pleaded guilty.  In fact, he had
    wanted to fight the case, but the duty solicitor told him that he would
    not get legal aid as it was a small matter,  and  that  he  had  better
    plead guilty, as if he wished to defend the case he would have to  find
    the money to pay for it.  He had a long  discussion  with  his  lawyer,
    then went before the Judge  and  the  lawyer  pleaded  guilty  for  the
    appellant. The appellant said nothing himself.  He did not really  hear
    the Judge: all he remembered was the Judge saying that for the  next  6
    months he had to behave, and that he had to pay ï¿½20.  The appellant was
    irritated and upset, and did not really take in what kind  of  sentence
    it was.

51. As regards his current partner, the appellant said that she  had  moved
    to Lincolnshire in 2007, so that the events concerning  the  deaths  of
    her family members would have occurred in 2006 and  2007.   Before  her
    parents' deaths, they were his partner's carers.  After they  died  and
    she relocated, his partner was a mess and to his knowledge she  had  no
    support or carer.  He took her to hospital to  be  sectioned  in  2012,
    because his partner was so ill.  Now, the  primary  care  team  locally
    supported them both, with the appellant as his partner's carer;  if  he
    were not there, she would forget to take her medication and become ill.
     They also received support from the Crisis Team when  necessary.   The
    appellant rejected the idea that his partner was more ill  since  their
    relationship had begun.

52. The appellant  also  said  that  he  had  not  been  motivated  by  the
    possibility of a drugs test in hospital when admitting his  heroin  use
    to Dr Lavender.  He had already been to hospital, but no test had  been
    administered.  The appellant had been using heroin for many years.   He
    could not say exactly when he began, and he would stop and  start.   It
    was certainly before 2005, and might well have been  2004.   He  had  a
    motorbike accident in 2004 and waited a long time  for  the  operation.
    That, and not heroin, was the reason he could not  work  in  2004/2005:
    the appellant had worked when he was using heroin, at times.

53. The appellant was asked why, on 27 June 2016, he had told  Dr  Lavender
    that he had not recently been arrested, when he knew that to be untrue,
    as he had been arrested in May 2016.  He replied that he had  panicked,
    and that he did not feel guilty.  He wanted to fight  the  case,  which
    was still outstanding.  He then contacted his  immigration  lawyer  and
    told them about the arrest, and the solicitors told  the  Home  Office.
    The appellant said he was not generally very good with dates.

54. Asked whether the Tribunal could be expected to believe him, as he  had
    lied to Dr Lavender, the  appellant  repeated  that  he  had  told  his
    solicitors the truth and they had told the Home Office.

55. The appellant was asked about his partner's instability and whether his
    relationship with her increased the  risk  of  his  committing  further
    crimes.  He said that was absolutely wrong.  Asked whether he had shown
    that he was no longer actively using heroin, the appellant said that he
    had kept a home, paid all the bills, paid his daughter's telephone bill
    and taken care of his partner, attending all her medical  appointments,
    none of which would have been possible if he were still  using  heroin.
    Drugs were everywhere: visiting his daughter, 20 miles  away,  did  not
    put the appellant at greater risk.   He  accepted  that  he  still  had
    friends in that area who would be able to supply him, but said that  he
    could use heroin anywhere he wanted.  It was not  difficult  to  obtain
    it.  He had done so once, in 2015, but not since.  His partner had also
    used heroin, but not since he had met her.  The  appellant  never  used
    drugs with his partner.

56. The appellant was asked  about  the  fact  that  his  criminal  offence
    occurred not long after  he  moved  out  of  his  parents'  house:   he
    repeated that he was trying to 'do his job' and  protect  his  partner.
    He always managed her  medication,  and  he  wanted  to  give  her  the
    medication she needed.  In fact, it was his  parents  who  were  living
    with the appellant, not the other way round.  The  appellant  had  left
    them the lease and the house, and looked for somewhere  else  with  his
    partner.

57. The appellant complained that this case had been hanging over him for 6
    years, stopping him moving on with his life.  As an  ex-drug  user,  he
    was doing quite well, running a home, paying all his bills, taking care
    of himself, his partner and his daughter, when he saw her.  He  was  40
    years old and getting too old for this.  The  appellant  gave  confused
    evidence as to when he last saw  his  daughter,  probably  in  July  or
    August, during the summer hols.  He also saw  his  daughter  at  Easter
    too, and for her birthday on 9 September 2016.   He  could  not  always
    visit his daughter, because when he did so, he had to leave his partner
    with his mother.

58. There was no re-examination.





Appellant's partner

59. The appellant's partner adopted her brief statement of  December  2015.
    She said  that  they  met  in  2012,  when  both  were  living  in  the
    appellant's previous home area.  They  developed  a  strong  bond:  she
    moved away, for a time, but they stayed in  touch  and  when  she  came
    back, in summer 2013, they moved in together  in  his  mother's  house.
    They then moved to their present area in mid-2014, and were  joined  by
    the appellant's mother at the end of that year.

60. The appellant's partner confirmed her diagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder:
    she had experienced it all her life, but since 2012, the  symptoms  had
    been harder  to  manage  than  ever  before.   The  primary  care  team
    supported both the appellant's partner, and the  appellant  himself  as
    her carer, for which he received  carer's  allowance;  the  appellant's
    partner received ESA and PIP.  If he were not there to  help  her  take
    her medication, she often forgot, and then  became  ill  very  quickly.
    When alone, she could  become  very  anxious;  the  appellant,  or  his
    mother, were always there to help her.  Her stepbrother in  Slough  was
    the partner's only other family member.

61. The incident in May 2016 had arisen  because  the  appellant's  partner
    made a complaint about a stolen bag.  The police came  round,  and  she
    thought it was about that, but they brought up  an  outstanding  arrest
    warrant against her for shoplifting, and said they wanted to  take  her
    to the station. The appellant's partner 'lost it':  she  admitted  that
    she had not dealt well with the situation.  The police had taken her to
    the station but would not let her take her medication.  She was  shaky,
    but she did what she had to do.

62. The appellant's partner really did not know what she would  do  without
    the appellant.  She had not been able to think  about  it  at  all;  it
    would be devastating and have a big impact on her health and ability to
    manage her illness, as  well  as  devastating  the  appellant  and  his
    daughter, to whom he was a great father.

63. In answer to supplementary questions, the appellant's partner confirmed
    that her twin brother had  overdosed  in  suspicious  circumstances  in
    2007, her father took his own life in 2008 and her mother died  a  year
    later, of heart failure in 2009.  It had taken her since about 2010  or
    2011 to get the  symptoms  of  her  illness  back  under  control.  Her
    medication  regime  included  Venlafaxine,  Diazepam,  Quetiapine   (an
    antipsychotic drug), Lansoprazole and Buprenorphine.  Buprenorphine was
    a heroin-blocker, not a substitute, and  easier  to  take  than  heroin
    replacements.  Quetiapine helped with her auditory hallucinations.

64. If the appellant were to be deported to Portugal, his partner  had  not
    thought what she would do.  She was sure that she would not cope,  that
    it would make her unwell, and his daughter would  be  devastated.   The
    appellant's partner had always found  him  to  be  perfectly,  brutally
    honest with her, which meant a lot.  They had been friends for quite  a
    long time before they entered into a relationship,  and  the  appellant
    was the one who talked his partner into going to hospital. It  was  he,
    and his family, who had really turned things round for her.

65. In cross-examination, the appellant's partner confirmed  that  she  had
    previously used heroin, but not since she met the appellant.   She  did
    not consider that she could go to Portugal, because she would  not  get
    the medication and  support  she  needed  there.   Her  medication  was
    working well at present. Relocation to Portugal would be very difficult
    for the appellant's partner, who did not speak Portuguese.

66.  The  appellant's  partner  had  been  relocated  to  Lincolnshire   in
    approximately September 2008 with the help of Women's Aid, because  she
    was receiving a lot of threats from members of the  gang  against  whom
    she gave evidence, who had not taken it kindly.  She had  been  advised
    to change her name in her new life, but had not done so  and  the  gang
    had not pursued her in her new home.

67. The appellant's partner said that the relationship  really  began  when
    she got out of hospital in 2013, after being admitted voluntarily, with
    the appellant's help.  After coming out of  hospital,  the  appellant's
    partner had to go to a halfway house, to wait for  housing.   That  was
    the system.  It was not far from where the  appellant  lived  with  his
    mother. They became closer and she moved in with the appellant and  his
    parents at the end of 2013; the appellant  and  his  partner  moved  to
    their present accommodation in 2014, living by themselves there.   They
    were supported by the Primary Care Group and Crisis  Intervention  Team
    had been called out a few times and were good to both of them.

68. The appellant's daughter had last visited them just before her birthday
    in September 2016, and before that, she had been with them all  summer,
    during the Easter holidays, at half term, and generally for all  school
    holidays.

69. The appellant's partner was asked about the arrest in  May  2016.   She
    said they had been at home when the police came.  While taking  details
    of her stolen bag, they said there was a warrant  for  her  arrest  for
    shoplifting.  The appellant's partner 'lost it' and the appellant asked
    the police, about 5 times, if he could give her the evening medication.
    The appellant's partner was frightened, anxious and not coping.  If the
    appellant had been allowed to calm her down she would have  been  fine.
    She said that the appellant had not been  rude  or  aggressive  to  the
    police, but maybe a bit firm.  He was trying to explain the  importance
    of  the  medication,  some  of  which  she  took   for   her   auditory
    hallucinations. The police refused to allow the appellant to  give  his
    partner her medication. In  the  end,  they  were  both  arrested,  the
    appellant for assault,  but  that  was  later  reduced  to  obstructing
    arrest.

70. There was no re-examination.

Submissions

71. For the Secretary of State,  Mr  Lindsay  relied  on  the  respondent's
    skeleton argument and on her deportation decision of 15 July 2010.   In
    the skeleton argument, he submitted that the appellant had produced  no
    reliable evidence that he was not using heroin habitually now; he could
    skip the Buprenorphine heroin-blocking drug and just use heroin, and in
    September 2015 he had done exactly that.  He was no longer living  with
    his parents, so there was no one to  report  his  behaviour  should  he
    begin using again.  The appellant had not been honest with Dr  Lavender
    during his latest assessment; he had omitted to mention his obstruction
    offence. The key dates in order to determine whether the appellant  had
    a permanent right of residence in the United Kingdom were April 2004 to
    December 2005.  The appellant was unable to engage sufficiently to find
    work from about 2005, when his drug use was out of  hand.   Mr  Lindsay
    submitted that the reason why the appellant could not work was not  his
    leg injury, but his drug habit.   Regulation 6(6) required there to  be
    a genuine chance of being engaged in order for a person to continue  to
    be treated as a worker.

72. The appellant had not demonstrated a permanent right of  residence  and
    so rehabilitation was not capable of carrying  significant  weight  (MC
    (Essa principles recast) [2015]  UKUT  520  (IAC)).   The  respondent's
    decision to remove him taken in 2010 was both lawful and  proportionate
    in 2016.

73. The appellant was a recidivist offender who had not shown that  he  was
    working or actively contributing to society.   Pursuant  to  Regulation
    21(5), his removal was proportionate, and his account of  the  strength
    of his relationship with his current partner and his daughter should be
    discounted.  Indeed, given his recent conviction, his relationship with
    his  partner  appeared  to  be  a  contributory  factor  in  terms   of
    reoffending and not a weighty factor in  the  proportionality  balance.
    He was not a suitable person to hold the caring responsibility  he  did
    for his partner's medication. The respondent submitted  that  based  on
    the appellant's  personal  conduct,  he  was  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to public policy and  his  deportation  was
    proportionate.

74. Applying part VA of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    (as amended), the appellant was not financially independent, was in the
    United Kingdom unlawfully because he had not acquired a permanent right
    of residence when he entered into his relationship  with  his  partner,
    and his status had been precarious since 2008, such that little  weight
    could  be  given  to  his   relationship.    Removal   would   not   be
    disproportionate in Article 8 terms either.

75. In oral submissions, Mr Lindsay argued that the appellant should not be
    treated as a credible witness; he had lied to  Dr  Lavender  about  his
    arrest, although he was aware that part of Dr Lavender's  task  was  to
    assess the risk of reoffending.  His partner's evidence showed that the
    appellant was aware that he had received a conditional discharge and Mr
    Lindsay submitted that the appellant had sought to conceal or  minimise
    his recent offending to dishonestly strengthen  his  claim  to  remain.
    The Upper  Tribunal  should  reject  any  findings  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal which depended on credibility.

76. The appellant had, it now appeared, a recent conviction when he saw  Dr
    Lavender.  The OASys report of 28 May 2010 assessed  the  appellant  as
    presenting  a  medium  risk  of  serious  harm  and  a  high  risk   of
    reconviction.  Dr Lavender's conclusions on risk should be  treated  as
    entirely unreliable.

77. If, contrary to his written and oral submissions,  the  Upper  Tribunal
    were minded to find that the appellant had acquired a  permanent  right
    of residence, deportation was nevertheless justified in  the  light  of
    his recent conviction, the risk of reoffending, and the  risk  of  harm
    the appellant represented as he was not proven free of heroin use,  and
    the reoffending risk was considerably higher than that assessed  by  Dr
    Lavender. Rehabilitation was only  relevant  if  the  appellant  had  a
    permanent right of residence. There was no  reliable  evidence  of  any
    reasonable prospect of the appellant ceasing to offend.

78. For the appellant, Ms  Foot  relied  on  her  skeleton  argument.   She
    accepted that  the  appellant  needed  to  answer  the  issue  of  non-
    disclosure of his recent criminal offence, and his  use  of  heroin  in
    September 2015, but she submitted that the Mr Lindsay put the case  too
    high on behalf of the respondent.   Dr  Lavender's  reports  should  be
    given weight.  The appellant had volunteered  the  information  to  his
    solicitors and there was significant mitigation surrounding the offence
    committed, as the sentencing remarks reflected.  The appellant  had  an
    understandable need to assist his partner with her medication needs  at
    a time when she was stressed.

79. The appellant did not tell Dr Lavender about the  incident  because  he
    was scared what it would mean for his case, which chimed with  what  Dr
    Lavender  said,  elsewhere  in  his  report.   Most  of  Dr  Lavender's
    conclusions in that report should be treated as reliable.  The evidence
    before the Tribunal, applying Devaseelan, was insufficient to go behind
    the finding that the appellant had a permanent right of residence.

80. Dr Lavender had given sound  reasons  for  finding  that  the  risk  of
    reoffending was now low. The appellant was a recovering addict who  had
    made a mistake on one occasion.  He  was  no  longer  living  with  the
    former partner in whose company he had used drugs regularly and been  a
    poor parent to his daughter.  He had moved  away  from  the  home  area
    where all of that happened, and started a new life.  The appellant  had
    not used drugs, other than that one error, in  5  years.   He  had  not
    sought to conceal that error from Dr Lavender or his solicitors.

81. The medium risk of harm and high  risk  of  reoffending  in  the  OASys
    report  was  based  on  the  appellant's  previous  lifestyle  and  his
    relationship with his former partner. The appellant's relationship with
    his new partner was a significant  protective  feature.   He  took  his
    responsibility to her very seriously.  There was no evidence to support
    the assertion that any worsening in the appellant's  current  partner's
    state was attributable to their relationship, and his removal would  be
    disproportionate.

82. Regarding the appellant's relationship with his daughter, Ms Foot noted
    that there was nothing in the evidence before the Tribunal which  might
    enable it to go behind the findings in the social workers' report.  His
    child had suffered emotional abuse, as the only mixed race child in the
    area.  The appellant was now  a  skilled  and  responsible  father,  in
    contrast to his previous behaviour, and had a unique role in supporting
    his child, being mixed race himself, and in managing her behaviour.

83. Ms Foot relied on a child's right to direct contact with the parent, as
    set out in of Abdul (section 55 - Article 24(3)  Charter)  [2016]  UKUT
    00106 (IAC) at [26] and following, for  the  right  of  a  child  under
    section 55 to maintain personal relationship and  direct  contact  with
    both parents, unless it was contrary to the child's interest (see  also
    Deticek (Area of Freedom, Security and Justice) [2009] EUECJ C403-09 at
    [54]).

84. Ms Foot reminded the Tribunal, applying Secretary of State for the Home
    Department v Dumliauskas & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 145 (26 February  2015),
    that considerations of rehabilitation were relevant in EEA deportations
    where a permanent right of residence had been acquired.

85. Ms Foot accepted that applying  section  3(5)  of  the  1971  Act,  the
    appellant was a person 'liable to deportation' but submitted  that  the
    appellant was entitled to the 'serious  grounds'  level  of  protection
    from removal.  The appellant had been a qualified person in the  United
    Kingdom from March 2000, but the disputed period was that between April
    2004 and  March  2005.   Judge  Moulden  had  considered  all  relevant
    documents and the appellant's later dishonesty to Dr Lavender  did  not
    taint the  findings  Judge  Moulden  had  made,  which  were  based  on
    documentary evidence.  The appellant was being paid incapacity  benefit
    during that period, and the Tribunal should place significant weight on
    that as evidence that he was not able to work for health reasons.

86. All of the appellant's own family  were  in  the  United  Kingdom,  his
    mother, his brother and his father.  He had no relatives  in  Portugal.
    He regretted his offending history very much.  The provisions  of  Part
    VA of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (as  amended)
    were not applicable to cases under the EEA Regulations.  This  was  not
    an Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights) [2015] UKUT 00466
    (IAC) case.  The appellant now spoke English, had the ability to  work,
    and it was family life, not private life, which was in issue here.

87. In relation to  the  costs  thrown  away  of  the  December  2015,  the
    respondent had made no submissions and Ms Foot  argued  that,  applying
    Cancino, the behaviour of her instructing solicitors was not at a level
    sufficient to attract an award of costs, on any basis.

The law

88. The appellant's case falls to  be  considered  under  Regulation  21(3)
    (serious grounds) because he  has  established  a  permanent  right  of
    residence, as contended by the respondent before the Court  of  Appeal.
    The relevant provisions of Regulation 21 are therefore as follows:

         "21. (1) In this regulation a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health. ...
         (3) A relevant decision may not be taken in  respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.
         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;
             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;
             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;
             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;
             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.

         (6) Before taking a relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."

89. I have had regard to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Abdul  which
    held that:

         (i)          There is no hierarchy of weight or importance  in  the
             various considerations recited in regulation 21(6) of the  EEA
             Regulations. The weight to be attributed to each  factor  will
             vary according to the fact sensitive context of the individual
             case.
         (ii)       Where it is contended that the decision maker and/or the
             First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  has  acted  in  contravention  of
             section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
             2009,  the  Upper  Tribunal  will  scrutinise  the  degree  of
             engagement with all material evidence and, in particular, will
             search for clear findings in the decision of the FtT  of  what
             the best interests of any affected child are.
         (iii)     Article 24(3) of the EU  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights
             creates a free standing right (although not absolute).
         (iv)      Where this right is engaged, a  failure  by  the decision
             maker  and/or  the  FtT  to  acknowledge  it  and  to   decide
             accordingly may constitute a material error of law.

90. Articles 24(2) and 24 (3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights  provide
    that:

         '24... (2)    In all actions relating to children, whether taken by
         public  authorities  or  private  institutions,  the  child's  best
         interests must be a primary consideration.
         (3)      Every child shall have the right to maintain on a  regular
         basis a personal relationship and direct contact with both  his  or
         her parents, unless this is contrary to his or her best interests'.



91. That provision was considered by the Court of Justice of  the  European
    Union in Deticek, in the context of unilateral removal of  a  child  by
    one of the parents. At [54], the Court observed that

             "54. One of those fundamental  rights  of  the  child  is  the
             right, set out in Article 24(3) of the Charter, to maintain on
             a regular basis a personal  relationship  and  direct  contact
             with both parents, respect for that right  undeniably  merging
             into the best interests of any child."

92. Deticek is not otherwise of great assistance, as it focuses on children
    unlawfully removed without the consent of one parent,  and  concerns  a
    custody dispute.  Its validity, despite the age of  the  decision,  was
    reaffirmed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  J  (A  Child)  (1996  Hague
    Convention) (Morocco) [2015] EWCA Civ 329.

93. In Dumliauskas, Sir Stanley Burnton, with whom Lord Justice Jackson and
    Lord Justice Lloyd agreed, held that considerations  of  rehabilitation
    were appropriate only to  appellants  who  could  show  that  they  had
    acquired  a  permanent  right  of  residence,  and  that  absent   such
    considerations, Courts and Tribunals should not assume that support for
    drug and alcohol treatment was unavailable in the  country  of  origin,
    unless there was clear evidence to that effect.

Factual matrix

94. The credibility of the appellant's account  before  Judge  Moulden  was
    largely accepted, as  it  was  consistent  with  the  large  amount  of
    documentary and medical evidence produced.  As regards the  credibility
    of the appellant's subsequent account and that of his current  partner,
    I am satisfied that they gave a broadly credible account.   I  bear  in
    mind that the appellant's partner gave evidence in a criminal trial  in
    her original home area, which was accepted by the Court and  led  to  a
    conviction.  I note that the appellant concealed from Dr  Lavender  his
    arrest in May 2016, and that his evidence before the Upper Tribunal was
    vague about the dates involved, and the penalty imposed.

95. In addition to the facts found and preserved in the decision  of  Judge
    Moulden, I make the following findings.  The appellant has  turned  his
    life round since 2013.  He no longer lives in the  area  where  he  was
    known as a drug dealer who had  gone  to  prison.   The  appellant  has
    rebuilt his relationship with  his  former  partner  on  the  basis  of
    friendship and co-operating as responsible parents.   He  has  improved
    his relationship with his daughter.  The appellant now  recognises  his
    part in the difficulties which his daughter had, caused by his  chaotic
    life and toxic relationship with  his  former  partner.   He  sees  his
    daughter regularly, with his new partner, and is  available  to  assist
    his former partner when his daughter misbehaves.

96. I have regard to the change in the daughter's living arrangements.   In
    2013, she was living away from both her parents, with her grandparents,
    pursuant to a Court order.  There is no order now, and  no  restriction
    on the  appellant  spending  time  with  his  daughter.   He  has  also
    maintained a relationship of some kind with his daughter's stepbrother.



97. The appellant's partner has been the catalyst  for  this  change.   Her
    mental health is fragile. She needs him, and he is trusted  to  support
    her, by his partner, and by Social Services, who have arranged for  him
    to be her paid carer.  He took responsibility for  his  partner  before
    that, getting her to hospital when she broke down in 2012  or  2013.  I
    place weight on the fact that he  is  trusted  by  Social  Services  to
    administer a particularly complex drugs regime to his partner,  and  on
    the responsibility he took in getting  her  admitted  to  hospital  and
    properly cared for within the mental health system, as well  as  making
    sure that their home is well run and the bills paid promptly.

98. I find that the appellant has been mostly drug free for 5 years and has
    not dealt drugs since going to prison.  The appellant and  his  partner
    both take a heroin-blocking drug:  if he had begun to use heroin again,
    it would have been picked up  quickly.   He  admits  to  still  smoking
    cannabis occasionally, and to having smoked heroin once,  in  September
    2015, but not before or since.  I consider it more likely than not that
    the appellant has told the truth about his one incident of drug use  in
    September 2015.  If the appellant had returned to drug use, or to  drug
    dealing in  his  former  home  area,  given  his  previous  history  of
    criminality, he would have come to adverse notice very quickly.  In his
    new home area, the appellant has made a fresh start and though,  as  he
    said, drugs are available anywhere, again, given the involvement of the
    police and Social Services, if he were dealing, or  using,  I  consider
    that it would have come to light.

99. The appellant's criminal offence in May 2015 arose out of his  concerns
    for his partner, and his role as her  carer.   It  is  right  that  the
    appellant should not have reacted as  he  did,  but  it  is  no  longer
    suggested that he committed even common assault.  In  common  with  the
    sentencing Judge, I consider that the reasons given for  his  difficult
    behaviour with the police in May 2016 are credible, and  that  they  do
    mitigate the offence to some extent. The appellant  pleaded  guilty  to
    the obstruction charge and received a noticeably light  sentence  of  6
    months' conditional discharge and ï¿½20 penalty.

Permanent residence

100. The Court of Appeal restricted the rehearing  of  this  appeal  to  the
    facts found by Judge Moulden and 'absent any special circumstances'  to
    consideration of Regulation 21(3) of the EEA Regulations and Article  8
    ECHR.  That being the case,  applying  Dumliauskas,  rehabilitation  is
    relevant to the proportionality of removal.

101. For the respondent, Mr Lindsay has sought to reopen without notice  the
    applicability of Regulation  21(3),  arguing  that  the  appellant  was
    unable to work for a period  from  April  2004  -  December  2005,  and
    therefore has not acquired the necessary 5 years in the United  Kingdom
    in accordance with the Regulations to establish a  permanent  right  of
    residence.  That point was fully considered in the  decision  of  Judge
    Moulden.

102. I am bound by the consent order in the Court of Appeal,  which  limited
    the issues remitted to the  Upper  Tribunal  on  Regulation  21(3)  and
    Article  8  ECHR  only,  unless  the  respondent  can   show   'special
    circumstances'.   No  special  circumstances  have  been   shown:    Mr
    Lindsay's cross-examination relates not to new evidence about the years
    after Judge Moulden's decision in 2013, but  attempts  to  reverse  his
    findings as to what happened in 2004/2005.   The  appellant's  evidence
    held  up  under  cross-examination  and  remains  consistent  with  the
    documents with which Judge Moulden considered it to be  consistent.   I
    am not satisfied that any special circumstances have been shown by  the
    respondent to justify my going beyond the matters remitted by the Court
    of Appeal.

103. In any event, I am satisfied on the evidence before me that the  reason
    for the appellant's inability to work in  2004/2005  was  that  he  was
    waiting for an operation on his injured leg and that for  that  period,
    he was a person unable to work by reason  of  an  accident  or  illness
    (Regulation 5(7)). He therefore has a permanent right of residence  and
    the respondent can remove him only if  she  can  show  that  there  are
    serious grounds of public policy or public security for so doing.

 'Serious grounds of public policy or public security'

104. Turning then to the risk which  this  appellant  may  pose  to  society
    today, I must consider whether there  are  serious  grounds  of  public
    policy or public security for his removal from the United Kingdom,  and
    whether, based exclusively on this  appellant's  personal  conduct,  he
    represents  'a  genuine,  present,  and  sufficiently  serious   threat
    affecting one of the  fundamental  interests  of  society"  (Regulation
    21(5)(c)). Regulation 21(6) requires me to take into account  his  age,
    state of health, family and economic situation,  length  of  residence,
    social and cultural integration into the United Kingdom, and the extent
    of his links with his country of origin.  I may also have regard to any
    evidence of rehabilitation,  following  Dumliauskas,  since  he  has  a
    permanent right of residence.

105. I remind myself of the factors which must be taken  into  account  when
    considering the decision made by the  respondent  in  this  case.   The
    respondent must not base her decision on a person's  previous  criminal
    convictions alone; she  must  base  her  decision  exclusively  on  his
    personal  conduct,  which  must  represent  a  genuine,   present   and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society.  This  appellant  is  no  longer  a  drug  dealer  and  his
    conviction is now 8 years ago.  He is 40 years old and has been in  the
    United Kingdom for about 16 years, arriving here in 2000.  He  offended
    frequently between 2002 and 2007 when he was  arrested  and  prosecuted
    for drug dealing.  His offences during those 5 years  were  related  to
    his drug use and drug dealing.

106. On 15 July 2010, the OASys assessment was  that  he  presented  a  high
    risk of re-conviction and a medium risk of harm.   The  appellant  used
    his time profitably in prison, after a difficult  start  with  a  large
    number of adjudications at the beginning of  his  sentence.   It  seems
    that in prison, the appellant matured.  He took thinking skills courses
    and acquired a qualification as a fork lift truck driver.  When he came
    out in 2011, he made a fresh start.

107. The appellant was released from prison in April 2011 and has  not  been
    electronically tagged, or arrested for  or  convicted  of  any  further
    offences since then, except the one in May 2016. I have had  regard  to
    the appellant's failure to tell Dr Lavender  about  his  2016  offence.
    That was wrong.  His reasons for so doing were that he thought it would
    make his situation worse.   I  accept  that  explanation  and  while  I
    deplore the omission, I do not consider that the offence,  such  as  it
    was, represents a return to the  appellant's  previous  criminality  or
    makes him a present risk to the United Kingdom community.   I  do  not,
    however, find that this offence, or the appellant's vagueness about the
    dates in evidence, taints the overall credibility of his account of the
    last 3 years.  He has explained to my satisfaction why he did not  tell
    Dr Lavender of his arrest.  He  did  tell  his  immigration  solicitors
    about the offence, and the matter was disclosed promptly by them to the
    Upper Tribunal at the previous hearing.

108. It is clear that there has been a significant change  in  circumstances
    since the appellant broke up with his former partner, around  the  time
    of the hearing in 2013 before Judge Moulden.  He has a new relationship
    and has  moved  away  from  his  old  home  area,  and  he  has  a  new
    relationship with his current partner which has caused him to  take  on
    the responsibility of being her carer, and also seems to have  improved
    his relationship with his former partner and their child.    I  observe
    that whereas in 2013, his daughter was living  with  her  grandparents,
    away from the appellant and his former partner, under a court order for
    her protection, now she spends her school holidays and half terms  with
    the appellant and his current  partner,  as  well  as  seeing  him  for
    weekends every month or so. His remaining in the United Kingdom  is  in
    her section 55 best interests, which is a primary consideration in this
    appeal, albeit not a trump card.

109. As regards the considerations in Regulation 17(6), the appellant  is  a
    40-year old Portuguese citizen who is reasonably fit, except  that  his
    leg  needs  further  surgery.   His  level  of  social   and   cultural
    integration in the United Kingdom continues to increase.  He is closely
    involved with all members of his extended family.

110. The appellant has all of his own family here, to whom he is  close;  he
    has his current partner, who  is  his  life,  and  who  needs  him,  as
    recognised by the mental health teams which support them both; he has a
    daughter, ex-partner and stepson, and is particularly  needed  to  help
    deal with his daughter's  difficulties  as  a  mixed  race  child  with
    behavioural problems in a largely white area of the United Kingdom.   I
    remind myself that he often has to make the short journey to his former
    home area and help resolve problems between his daughter and his former
    partner, which would be  more  difficult  to  do  by  modern  means  of
    communication, given the complexity  and  seriousness  of  his  child's
    behavioural difficulties.

111. I accept the evidence of the appellant and  his  partner  that  he  has
    stayed away from crime and drugs for 5 years now, with the exception of
    2 lapses, one in September 2015, when he went back to his home area and
    took drugs after learning that this appeal had  been  remitted  to  the
    Upper Tribunal by the Court of Appeal and the decision  on  his  future
    would be further delayed, and one in May 2016, when he  obstructed  the
    police in the execution of their duty, while they were trying to arrest
    his current partner and when she was  distressed.   I  find  that  each
    incident has been explained and that there  is  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant has continued to deal in drugs, to use heroin, or  to  commit
    crimes, other than these specific incidents.

112. The appellant is now regarded as sufficiently responsible  to  be  paid
    as a carer for his current partner, whose health  is  fragile  and  who
    becomes ill very quickly if a dose is missed.   The  medication  regime
    she has is  complex  and  he  manages  it  well,  along  with  his  own
    Buprenorphine medication as a former heroin user.  I do not accept that
    his partner's increased medical need since moving out of her  own  home
    area can be attributed to this relationship; the evidence of  both  the
    appellant and his partner was to the contrary, and the  respondent  has
    produced no evidence to rebut their evidence.

113. The appellant is much more socially and culturally integrated into  the
    United Kingdom than he was in 2013: all his extended family  are  here,
    and he  also  deals  regularly  with  mental  health  teams  about  his
    partner's health.  He has no  relatives  in  Portugal,  but  it  cannot
    reasonably be said that he has no continuing personal or cultural links
    with Portugal, where he lived until he came to the United Kingdom,  age
    24.

114. I find that, taking all the Regulation 21(6) factors into account,  the
    respondent has not demonstrated  that  the  appellant  now  presents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious risk  affecting  one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.  Nor has she  shown  that  there  are
    serious grounds of public policy or public security for  removing  him.
    On the contrary, there is credible evidence of  ongoing  rehabilitation
    and of a more  responsible  approach  to  his  relationships  with  his
    current partner, his daughter, and his former partner.  On  that  basis
    alone, I would allow this appeal.

115. I turn, then, to Article 8 ECHR.   Much of what needs to be  considered
    under Article 8 also arises  under  Article  21(6).   Part  VA  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (as  amended)  does  not
    apply  to  EEA  cases  and  the  statutory  presumptions  therein   are
    inapplicable.  The appellant is 40 and has been in the  United  Kingdom
    since 2000, a period of some 16 years.  I am satisfied,  having  regard
    to the appellant's evidence and that of his partner  and  Dr  Lavender,
    that  he  is  no  longer  an  habitual  criminal  or  drug  user.   The
    appellant's partner's mental fragility and her health are now his chief
    concern.  His  current  partner  has  not  used   drugs   since   their
    relationship began in 2013, and the appellant has not used  drugs  with
    her. Both of them are on Buprenorphine and both of them are  recovering
    heroin addicts.

116. The appellant has all of his family members in the United Kingdom,  and
    also his new partner, who depends heavily on him and  has  (for  tragic
    reasons) no family of her own on whom to depend. He has his daughter, a
    difficult child now 14 years old, the only  mixed  race  child  in  her
    school, in whose life he is very present, assisting her mother when she
    misbehaves, and having her for school holidays and half terms, as  well
    as seeing her at weekends.  It  is  undoubtedly  in  the  child's  best
    interests to continue to have contact with the appellant, and I bear in
    mind the provisions of Article 24(3) of the Charter as to her right  to
    have contact with both parents.

117. Having regard to the Article 8  ECHR  considerations  remitted  to  the
    Upper Tribunal by the Court of Appeal, I am  not  satisfied  that  this
    appellant's removal to Portugal would be proportionate, in the light of
    the dependence of his partner and his child  upon  him,  and  his  much
    improved social situation and conduct.

118. The appeal will also be allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

Costs

119. I turn then to consider the reserved  question  of  the  costs  of  the
    hearing on 16 December  2015.   The  parties  were  directed  to  serve
    uptodate evidence and agree directions, in the decision of the Court of
    Appeal on 28 September 2015, which was a consent order.  The  appellant
    disregarded that direction and instead appeared  at  the  hearing  with
    over 600 pages of documents, some of which were new, and some were not.
     There was no attempt to put the respondent on notice.   The  appellant
    relies upon Cancino (costs - First-tier Tribunal - new  powers)  [2015]
    UKFTT 00059 (IAC), a decision of the Presidents of the  Upper  Tribunal
    and the First-tier Tribunal, and argues that the Upper Tribunal has  no
    costs power, because the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal predates  by
    four years the introduction of the power to award costs.

120. If such an omission occurred in  an  appeal  issued  after  2014,  then
    under the Tribunal Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and
    Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014, the First-tier Tribunal has power to make a
    costs order, and the Upper Tribunal  has  that  same  power  under  the
    paragraph 10 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (as
    amended).  I would have had no hesitation in  awarding  the  respondent
    the costs of the December 2015 hearing.

121. This is an appeal from a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  made  on
    16 September 2010, long before the 2014 First-tier Tribunal Rules  came
    into effect.  The First-tier Tribunal then had no power to award costs,
    and applying rule 10 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (as amended), neither does the Upper Tribunal.

122. I therefore make no order for inter partes costs.

    Decision

    1) The making of the previous decision involved the making of an  error
       on a point of law.   I set aside that decision.

    2) I remake the decision by allowing the  appeal  under  both  the  EEA
       Regulations and Article 8 ECHR.

    3) No order for costs
