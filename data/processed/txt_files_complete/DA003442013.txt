Representation:

For the Appellant: Ms Umoh-Abuidu of Duncan Lewis & Co. Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

     1. In a decision dated  18  June  2103,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Pitt,
        sitting with Lord Burns, found  that  a  panel  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal composed of First-tier Tribunal Judge Robinson and  Dr  CJ
        Winstanley (Non Legal Member) had made a material error of  law  in
        their determination dated 15 April 2013 in which they  allowed  the
        appellant's appeal against the decision dated 7  February  2013  of
        the Secretary of State which refused to revoke a deportation  order
        made against him.

     2. Following on from the finding of an error of law, the  decision  of
        the First-tier Tribunal  was set aside and must now be re-made.  It
        was common  ground  that  the  appeal  before  us  was  limited  to
        consideration of whether the deportation  order  made  against  the
        appellant should be revoked because it breached  his  rights  under
        Article 8 of the ECHR.

     3. It was also common ground that our task was to assess  whether  the
        appellant's claim could succeed under the "second stage" Article  8
        consideration identified most recently in Green (Article  8  -  new
        rules)  [2013]  UKUT  254  (IAC)  and  that   it   was   only   the
        proportionality of the interference with the appellant's family and
        private life that required assessment.

Preliminary Issues

     4. Ms Umoh-Abuidu applied for an adjournment. The application was made
        in order for Ms Neolino Bernardo to attend to  give  evidence.  She
        was said to be unable to attend the hearing for unspecified medical
        reasons. Ms Bernardo's evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  had
        been significant and,  maintained  Ms  Umoh-Abuidu,  in  order  for
        justice to be seen to be done  her  presence  at  the  hearing  was
        necessary.

     5. We did not find that the hearing should be adjourned in  order  for
        Ms Bernardo to attend. Firstly, as  confirmed  by  Mr  Walker,  the
        respondent agreed that the evidence Ms Bernardo gave to the  First-
        tier Tribunal could be taken at its highest.  There was no  dispute
        that the appellant's community  work  was  a  "significant"  factor
        weighing in his favour, as found by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Ms
        Umoh-Abuidu suggested that more evidence had been given in front of
        the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  was  shown  on  the  face  of  the
        determination and that we needed to hear  that  evidence.  If  that
        were so, however, it  should  have  been  the  subject  of  further
        witness statement, in line with the direction of 18 July  2013  but
        was not. It did not appear to us to be in the interests of  justice
        or in line with the  overriding  objective  of  avoiding  delay  to
        adjourn  to  hear  evidence  from  a  witness  whose  evidence  was
        undisputed and where the findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
        that evidence were settled.

     6. Ms Umoh-Abuidu also submitted that the appeal should be remitted to
        the First-tier Tribunal in order to be re-made. We did  not  agree.
        We were somewhat surprised at this submission as it was  made  only
        after the hearing before us had commenced and no  earlier.  In  any
        event, the Senior President's Practice Statement dated 25 September
        2012 indicates that when a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
        set aside, it is "likely" that the Upper Tribunal will  proceed  to
        re-make the decision unless:

        "the nature or  extent  of  the  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
        necessary in order for the decision to be  re-made  is  such  that,
        having regard  to  the  overriding  objective  in  rule  2,  it  is
        appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal."

     7. There are no facts to be found by us. The decision  of  the  First-
        tier Tribunal panel was set aside for a failure to weigh the public
        interest correctly but their findings of fact were  not  challenged
        and remain intact. Indeed, very few of the facts in this  case,  if
        any, were disputed by the respondent. We concluded that we remained
        correctly seized of the re-making of this appeal.

     8. On the morning of the hearing  Mr  Walker  served  a  letter  dated
        January 2008 setting out why, at  that  time,  the  respondent  was
        seeking to deport the appellant's father. Mr Walker indicated  that
        the father's  appeal  against  deportation  had  subsequently  been
        allowed by a Tribunal and that he currently has discretionary leave
        to remain (DLR). That  the  appellant's  father  had  an  irregular
        immigration history but had  subsequently  been  granted  DLR  were
        matters already in evidence. However, Ms Umoh-Abuidu suggested that
        this  letter  was  prejudicial  to  the  appellant  and   that   an
        adjournment was required in order to deal with it. We gave our view
        that this letter did not undermine the appellant's case given  that
        his father had not been deported and now had lawful  leave.  Having
        been afforded time to discuss this matter with  the  appellant,  Ms
        Umoh-Abuidu confirmed that she was ready to proceed.

     9. These issues having been decided, the  parties  accepted  that  the
        appeal could be dealt with by way of submissions with reference  to
        the documentary evidence before us.


Background


    10. The following matters are not in dispute. The appellant was born on
        26 May 1988 and is citizen of Angola. His father brought him to the
        UK illegally in September 2001 when he was aged 13.  The  appellant
        has never been back to Angola  and  has  no  relatives  there.  The
        appellant's father claimed asylum and the appellant was a dependent
        on that claim which was refused in 2004. The appellant  lived  with
        his father, step-mother and a half-brother. He  obtained  GCSEs  in
        2004.

    11. When the appellant's father was arrested by immigration authorities
        in 2004 or 2005, as he did not get on  with  his  step-mother,  the
        appellant left the family home in Rochdale and came to London.   He
        was aged approximately 16 or 17  years  old  at  that  time.  On  8
        January 2008 he committed the offence of affray. On 31 May 2008  he
        committed a robbery and an attempted a robbery, both involving  the
        use of an imitation firearm. On 5 December he was  sentenced  to  3
        years and 6 months imprisonment for these offences.

    12. On 27 January 2009, the respondent informed the  appellant  of  his
        liability  to  automatic  deportation.  On  4  February  2009   the
        appellant applied for the Facilitated Removal Scheme (FRS) and  his
        application was approved but on 21 May 2009 he indicated that he no
        longer wished to return to Angola under the scheme. On 30  November
        2009 he applied  again  for  the  FRS  and  his  application  again
        approved. On 1 December 2009 he withdrew  the  application.  On  17
        February 2010 the respondent informed the  appellant  that  he  was
        subject to the automatic deportation process and served him with  a
        deportation order made on 10 February 2010. The appellant  did  not
        appeal the decision.

    13. An emergency travel document (ETD)  application  was  made  by  the
        respondent on 23 February 2010. It is not clear  what  happened  to
        that application. When the appellant's custodial sentence ended  on
        6 March 2010 he was  detained  in  immigration  detention  but  was
        released on bail on 21 July 2010.

    14. The appellant returned to London and  formed  a  relationship  with
        Deborah Rose, a German national who came to the UK at the age of 5.
        In September 2010 the appellant began voluntary work at the  Nutmeg
        Community, a youth project in London working with young  people  to
        show them  the  risks  of  anti-social  behaviour  and  dangers  of
        carrying knives and guns.

    15. The respondent made  a  further  ETD  application  to  the  Angolan
        authorities on 11 June 2012 and when the appellant went  to  report
        on 6 August 2012 he was detained. On 29 October  2012  he  made  an
        application  for  the  deportation  order  to  be   revoked.   That
        application was refused on 7 February 2013 and it is  that  refusal
        which gave rise to these proceedings. As above, the appeal  against
        the refusal to revoke the deportation  order  was  allowed  by  the
        First-tier Tribunal after a hearing on 4 April 2013. That  decision
        was set aside for error of  law  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  after  a
        hearing on 11 June 2013. The  appellant  was  granted  bail  by  an
        Immigration Judge in July 2013.

Article 8 ECHR

    16. It was accepted by the advocates that the issue before  us  is  the
        proportionality of the decision as none of the  other  intermediate
        questions set down in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 [2004] INLR 349 are  in
        dispute.

    17. We have set out our proportionality assessment  in  line  with  the
        guidance provided in Boultif v Switzerland [2001]  ECHR  54273,  as
        confirmed by Uner v the Netherlands [2007] Imm AR 303, in which the
        European Court of Human Rights said that in order to assess whether
        an expulsion measure was necessary  in  a  democratic  society  and
        proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, the following criteria
        had to be considered:


          (i) The nature and the seriousness of the offence committed by the
              Appellant;
          (ii)     The length of the Appellant's stay in the country from
             which he or she was to be expelled;
          (iii)    The time that had elapsed since the offence was committed
      and the               claimant's conduct during that period.
          (iv)  The nationalities of the various parties concerned;
          (v) The Appellant's family situation, such as length of marriage
      and other        factors expressing the effectiveness of the
      Appellant's family life;
          (vi)     Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time he
             or she entered into the family relationship;
          (vii)    Whether there are children in the marriage and if so
      their ages;
          (viii)   The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse is
      likely to             encounter in the country of the Appellant's
      origin;
          (ix)     The best interests and well being of any children of the
             Appellant; and in particular the seriousness of any
             difficulties that they would be likely to encounter in the
             country to which the Appellant would be expelled;
          (x)      The solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the
      host country and          with the country of destination.


    18. The placing of offending behaviour at the beginning of the list of
        the Boultif criteria is reflected in the guidance provided by Masih
        (deportation - public interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012]
        UKUT 00046 (IAC) in which a Presidential panel set down basic
        principles derived concerning the public interest in deportation
        cases:


         (i)  In a case of automatic deportation, full account must be taken
             of the strong public interest in removing foreign
             citizens  convicted of serious offences, which lies not only
             in the prevention of further offences on the part of the
             individual concerned, but in deterring others from committing
             them in the first place.


         (ii)     Deportation of foreign criminals expresses society's
    condemnation of        serious criminal activity and promotes public
    confidence in the
              treatment    of foreign citizens who have committed them.


          (iii)   The starting-point for assessing the facts of the offence
   of which an                  individual has been committed, and their
   effect on others, and on the              public as a whole, must be the
   view taken by the sentencing judge.


         (iv)     The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis of the
             situation at the date of the hearing.


         (v)  Full account should also be taken of any developments since
             sentence was passed, for example the result of any
             disciplinary adjudications in prison or detention, or any
             OASys or licence report.


    19. We noted  the  comments  in  Masih  that  the  public  interest  in
        deportation lies "not only in the prevention  of  further  offences
        ... but in deterring  others"  and  that  the  same  principle  was
        expressed by the Court of Appeal in OH Serbia v  SSHD  [2008]  EWCA
        Civ 694, the latter case also emphasising the role  of  deportation
        in expressing the public's revulsion and building public confidence
        in the treatment of foreign citizens  who  have  committed  serious
        crimes.

    20. Following the guidance in Boultif and Masih, we start by
        considering the appellant's offences and the view taken by the
        sentencing judge.

    21. The appellant was cautioned in 2004 for a common assault committed
        when he was 15 years old.

    22. On 8 January 2008 the appellant committed an affray. He was
        sentenced to 8 weeks in a Youth Offender Institution (YOI) for that
        offence.

    23. On 31 May 2008, the appellant committed a robbery for which he was
        sentenced to 3 � years in prison. On the same date he committed an
        attempted robbery for which he was sentenced to 3 years in prison.
        On the same date he was in possession of an imitation firearm for
        which he was sentenced to 2 � years.

    24. All of the custodial sentences for the offences in 2008 were to be
        served concurrently making the total to be served 3 � years.

    25. In his sentencing remarks on 5 December 2008, the His Honour Judge
        Fraser sitting at the Inner London Crown Court, stated:


        "... the facts in respect of the affray ... were that you ended  up
        being part of a larger group trying to gain entry to a party  being
        held in a houseboat.


        It is quite clear that this was an extremely serious affray, to the
        extent that knives were certainly used and two of the doormen  were
        stabbed and as a result one of them had life-threatening  injuries.
        Now, against that, I must balance the accepted basis of  plea  that
        you have entered to this on the basis that you had no knowledge  of
        any knives being there or being used, or indeed at any stabbing  as
        well. Clearly, obviously, given the nature of the affray, I have to
        take into account the nature of the offending as a whole,  as  well
        as your individual part in it.


        As far as the matters on  31st  of  May  are  concerned,  they  are
        significantly more serious. In respect  of  that  robbery  and  the
        attempted  robbery  committed  using  an  imitation  firearm,  with
        others, you approached the person on the  first  occasion,  pointed
        the gun towards his stomach, demanding his wallet and  phone.  Now,
        when you were searched later on, the wallet was found on  you,  and
        you were identified as the  person  with  that  firearm.  Both  the
        wallet and the phone were taken, and you ran off.


        But that was not an end of it because  shortly  after  that,  again
        with another, you approached another person, and again demanded his
        phone. You said you were not fucking about, and you showed you  had
        a gun. You then went to cock the imitation firearm when your victim
        - and, frankly, extremely bravely,  and he is to  be  congratulated
        for that - took hold of your gun, and you ended  up  on  the  floor
        before your accomplice hit the victim and you  were  both  able  to
        escape. Thankfully, again, the armed police who  had  been  alerted
        after the first incident found you before any more damage could  be
        done.


        In respect of the firearm charge, I have obviously  considered  the
        relevant issues as I must ... . I take account  of  the  fact  that
        this is an imitation firearm that  you  were  using.  I  take  into
        account what you  did  with  it.  You  used  it  quite  clearly  to
        intimidate and frighten and ensure your victim complied  with  your
        demands, and that is specifically - certainly true in  both  cases,
        rather more serious in  the  first,  I  might  suggest,  given  the
        firearm was actually brought out and pointed at your victim. I have
        also take into account of the  fact  that  you  had  the  imitation
        firearm with the intention, quite clearly, by  the  nature  of  the
        offence that you have pleaded guilty to, of  committing  robberies,
        and also finally I have taken note of the fact that you have got no
        convictions and the caution - apart from you  have  a  caution,  in
        fact, for common assault which was when you were just 15 years old,
        back in 2004.


        Now, the reality is,  these,  as  your  counsel  has  very  rightly
        accepted,  are  extremely  serious  offences  with  a   number   of
        aggravating features. It is clear there  was  some  planning  here,
        given the use of a weapon to threaten. The fact you armed  yourself
        with an imitation firearm and used it, particularly in the  robbery
        offence, to point at the victim again aggravates that  matter.  The
        fact you were operating with others, and with one another as far as
        the attempted robbery is concerned, again weighs in  my  mind,  and
        the fact that both offences were committed at night. The result  of
        all of those matters must  have  been  a  horrendously  frightening
        experience for the two victims of what you did.


        Now, turning to you: you are 20 years old; you were 19 at the  time
        of the earlier affray. You have, as I say, no previous convictions.




        ...


        I have to say that I can see a basis of the concluding  that  there
        is a significant risk of  committing  further  specified  offences.
        However, it seems to me there is not sufficient evidence before  me
        to suggest there is a significant risk of those offences  resulting
        in death or serious injury, and so on that basis I am going to pass
        a determinate sentence in your case.


        Now, in mitigation - and I have  listened  very  carefully  to  the
        helpful mitigation put forward on your behalf  by  your  counsel  -
        quite clearly your plea of guilty to the affray at a somewhat later
        stage certainly results in me having  reduced  the  sentence  I  am
        going to pass in respect of that to (sic) about 20%. In respect  of
        the robbery offences and firearm offence, you pleaded guilty at the
        earliest opportunity, and I have reduced the sentence I am going to
        impose by a third as a result.


        I have taken full account of everything that has been  put  forward
        on your behalf. I have read very carefully the pre-sentence report.
        I have also noted the letters that are put before me,  particularly
        the letter that you have written, and also the  matters  that  show
        you have, I am pleased to say, certainly shown remorse for what you
        have done, and indeed, there are some  hopeful  signs  of  progress
        whilst you have been on remand, and  I  certainly  view  that  with
        certain - certainly is a positive sign. I note, also, the  comments
        that have been made by people who know, or certainly  have  seen  a
        better side to you, and I also take account of your early  life  in
        Angola.


        Given all the factors, it is clear that, as you know and  has  been
        accepted on your  behalf,  all  these  offences  pass  the  custody
        threshold, certainly the serious matters by a significant margin. I
        do intend to pass  sentences  of  detention  in  a  Young  Offender
        Institution in your case. They will be the  shortest  which  in  my
        opinion match the  seriousness  of  your  offences  and  take  into
        account the mitigating factors in each of your  cases,  and  indeed
        the period you will spend on licence following your release."


    26. It is clear  from  the  sentencing  remarks  that  the  appellant's
        offences must be weighed extremely heavily against him  given  that
        the robbery and attempted robbery involving  an  imitation  firearm
        are described as "extremely serious" and  were  considered  by  the
        judge  to  be  "significantly  more  serious"  than  what  was   an
        "extremely serious affray".  As indicated by the Presidential panel
        of the Upper Tribunal  in  the  head  note  of  Sanade  and  others
        (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048(IAC):

        "The more serious the offending,  the  stronger  is  the  case  for
        deportation, but Parliament  has  not  stated  that  every  offence
        serious enough  to  merit  a  penalty  of  twelve  months  or  more
        imprisonment makes interference with human rights proportionate."

    27. We noted that there were aspects of  the  sentencing  remarks  that
        went in  the  appellant's  favour,  however.  He  had  no  previous
        convictions and he pleaded guilty. He had not known that others  in
        the affray had  knives.  He  had  "shown  remorse"  and  had  shown
        "hopeful signs of progress" whilst on remand.

    28. The sentencing judge had before him, as we  did,  the  Pre-Sentence
        report (PSR) dated 27 November 2008. In essence, this expresses the
        same positive and negative features  that  we  have  noted  in  the
        sentencing remarks. The PSR identified that the motivation for  the
        offending "was financial  gain  with  the  trigger  possibly  being
        financial difficulties and peer influence." The appellant's risk of
        reoffending was assessed as medium even though he did  not  have  a
        significant pattern of offending. It was accepted that "[h]is early
        history and his subsequent family difficulties have contributed  to
        him currently being on the margins of society, where he has started
        to offend." It was accepted that he  had  "expressed  remorse"  and
        "appeared  pro-social  in  attitude  and  anxious  to  improve  his
        circumstances so he does not reoffend in future." It was also found
        positive that he did not have a substance abuse problem.

    29. We bore in mind these varying aspects of the  appellant's  criminal
        offences when reaching our conclusion.

    30. Turning to the other Boultif criteria that have  purchase  in  this
        case, the appellant has been in the UK for 12 years, since the  age
        of 13. This is quite a long period of time and included almost  all
        of his formative  teenage  years.  Against  that,  the  appellant's
        presence in the UK has always been unlawful.

    31. The appellant's conduct since his arrest in 2008 has been positive.
        He has not reoffended. He has continued to show the "hopeful  signs
        of progress" noted by the sentencing judge, attending  courses  and
        obtaining qualifications whilst in prison and continuing to  do  so
        after his release, building on the GCSE qualifications he  obtained
        while at school. We accepted that his conduct since his  period  of
        imprisonment reflects the remorse that he has expressed.

    32. Of particular note is the  voluntary  work  he  undertook  for  the
        Nutmeg Community from September 2010 to  July  2012.  As  indicated
        above, we accepted at its highest the evidence of Ms Bernardo  from
        that organisation. The appellant assisted in running workshops  for
        young people in order to try to  avoid  them  being  drawn  towards
        offending behaviour. In her statement, Ms Bernardo found  that  the
        appellant had made "excellent contributions". In her oral  evidence
        before the First-tier Tribunal she said that his:

     "contribution to the organisation was highly important. She  found  him
    to be a completely different person since his conviction  for  robbery.
    She said he had a few problems getting on with people at first but  his
    communication skills have improved to the extent that young people were
    able to confide in him."

It was our view that the appellant must be given full credit  for  his  work
with Nutmeg Community and that it was a significant factor to be weighed  in
his favour.

    33. It is accepted that the appellant has a number of relatives in  the
        UK, including his father, a  half-brother,  uncles  and  aunts  and
        cousins. He has some contact with these relatives but  it  was  not
        seriously argued that his relationships with them could amount to a
        family life albeit they form  part  of  the  private  life  he  has
        established in the UK since  2001.  We  accepted  that  he  has  no
        relatives remaining in Angola, his mother and  her  current  family
        living in Portugal.

    34. It is also accepted that that  the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and
        subsisting relationship with his partner,  Deborah  Rose,  who  has
        lived in the UK for  most  of  her  life.  We  accepted  that  this
        relationship weighed in the appellant's favour. Ms Rose  has  acted
        in support of the appellant during  his  detention  and  throughout
        these proceedings. We accepted that Ms  Rose,  who  was  only  ever
        lived in either Germany or the UK, could not reasonably be expected
        to accompany the appellant to Angola and that  if  he  is  deported
        this would effectively end their relationship. It remained the case
        that, in our judgement, somewhat less weight should  be  placed  on
        the relationship with Ms Rose as  it  was  formed  only  after  the
        appellant had been served with a deportation order and  the  couple
        have never lived together.

    35. We accept that the appellant has limited ties to and  knowledge  of
        Angola given that he came here at the age of 13, some 12 years ago.
        We did not accept that he has no ties or knowledge of  the  country
        at all, however, given that he spent the first 13 years of his life
        there. That said, we accept that his social,  cultural  and  family
        ties to the UK are much stronger  than  any  he  will  be  able  to
        establish for some time on  return  to  Angola.  We  recognise,  as
        indicated in the country evidence relied  upon  by  the  appellant,
        that Angola will offer  him  far  more  limited  opportunities  for
        education, work and so on to those he might enjoy in the UK.

    36. Ms Umoh-Abuidu commented on the respondent's delay in dealing  with
        the appellant's case,  the  appellant  having  been  released  from
        criminal detention over 2 years ago. It will be  evident  from  the
        background set out above, however, that the respondent informed the
        appellant of his liability to deportation in early 2009, only a few
        months after he was sentenced and that there have been a number  of
        attempts to deport him since then,  the  failure  of  which  cannot
        solely be laid at the door of the respondent.  It  appeared  to  us
        that little weight, if any, fell to the  appellant's  side  of  the
        balance in this regard given that he has  been  aware  since  early
        2009 of the respondent's intention to deport him, his withdrawal of
        two FRS applications in 2009 and that the current proceedings arise
        from his own application in October 2012 made at a  time  when  the
        respondent was again taking steps to deport him to Angola.

    37.  Ms  Umoh-Abuidu  also  submitted  that  the   appellant's   family
        background,  being  brought  here  illegally  by  his  father,  his
        father's   own   immigration   difficulties   and   the    domestic
        circumstances that led to the appellant leaving  home  at  a  young
        age, should also be weighed in his favour.  We  accepted  that  the
        evidence  before  us  did  not  suggest  that  appellant  has   had
        particularly positive or stable family support.

Conclusion

    38. Having set out our view on the competing factors in this matter, we
        must come down on one side of the balance.

    39. In the final analysis, it was our view that the seriousness of  the
        appellant's offending behaviour brought the balance down in  favour
        of the public interest and made the interference  with  his  family
        and private life proportionate. Put simply, his "extremely serious"
        offences were so  serious  that  the  factors  in  the  appellant's
        favour, even when weighed cumulatively and at their  highest,  were
        not sufficient outweigh the public interest in the  deportation  of
        the appellant.

Decision

    40. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error on
        a point of law and was set aside.

    41. We re-make the appeal as refused.
