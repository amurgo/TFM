Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Parkin, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  who  appealed  against  the
    decision to refuse him leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) under
    paragraph 245DD(h) of the Immigration Rules.  The appellant had applied
    for leave on 25 February 2014 and his application was refused on 7  May
    2014.  His appeal against that refusal was dismissed by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Watt ("the FTTJ") on 15 September 2015.

 2. No anonymity order was sought and none is required.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the ground that  the  FTTJ
    had considered new  evidence  contrary  to  s85A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002; had ignored the respondent's  concerns
    about plagiarism; had not considered whether payments were corroborated
    in the bank statements; in making a findings that the appellant had not
    charged VAT, had failed to take account of the evidence that his income
    was below the VAT threshold; and failed to make an  assessment  of  the
    appellant's background and experience pertaining to the business.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein on 9
    March 2016, as follows:

         "1.      The renewed grounds continue to  rely  upon  the  original
             grounds submitted in support  of  the  first  application  for
             permission to appeal, but also challenge the reasoning of  the
             First-tier Tribunal judge who refused permission.

         2. Whilst I observe that in considering  inter  alia,  the  further
             evidence tendered by the appellant at the hearing, the  First-
             tier Tribunal Judge found in the appellant's favour  that  the
             relevant investment sum was available for investment by him, I
             am mindful that the clear policy underlying ss. 85 and 85A  of
             the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 was that  the
             Tribunal should be able to consider a broad range of  evidence
             in relation to appeals generally but a more limited  range  of
             evidence in relation to appeals against decisions that had  to
             be considered under the Points Based System,  whether  or  not
             the appeal as here also involved a removal decision under s.47
             of the 2006 Act.

         3. I am therefore persuaded that  notwithstanding  that  the  Judge
             reached both positive and negative findings  on  the  evidence
             tendered by the appellant at the hearing to which it does  not
             appear that the Presenting Officer raised an  objection,  that
             in all the circumstances permission to appeal on  all  of  the
             grounds should be granted."

 5. The grounds of appeal in the First-tier Tribunal mirror those  made  in
    the Upper Tribunal for permission to  appeal.   Thus  the  appeal  came
    before me today.

 6. Both Mr Parkin, for the appellant, and Mr Whitwell, for the respondent,
    agreed that the FTTJ had erred in law  in  allowing  the  appellant  to
    adduce additional evidence, contrary to  s85A.  Both  referred  to  the
    guidance in Ahmed & Another  (PBS:  admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT
    00365 (IAC).  I agreed with them  and  asked  for  submissions  on  the
    materiality of the error.

 7. Mr Parkin submitted that all those documents adduced for the  appellant
    and listed at paragraphs 12 and 13 of  the  FTTJ's  decision  had  been
    produced after the date of decision. He had a  "strong  suspicion"  but
    "no firm knowledge" that those documents listed as being  in  the  Home
    Office  bundle  were  those  submitted  by  the  appellant   with   his
    application. These would, if so, have been admissible.  It  was  clear,
    he submitted, that the FTTJ had taken into account documents which were
    inadmissible under s85A  (eg  those  to  which  reference  is  made  at
    paragraph 33 onwards).   He  submitted  that  the  adverse  credibility
    findings  arose  from  the  findings  derived  from  the   inadmissible
    evidence. Thus the adverse credibility findings were  not  sustainable.
    He submitted that, in line with Ahmed, it was impossible  to  say  what
    finding the FTTJ would have reached if only the admissible evidence had
    been considered. This was  not  a  case  where  the  FTTJ  had  adopted
    wholesale the reasons of the  respondent  for  refusal:  the  FTTJ  had
    accepted the appellant's case with regard to the availability of  funds
    for  investment,  for  example.   There  was  no  assessment   of   the
    respondent's concerns, merely silent approval of her reasoning.

 8. For the respondent, Mr Whitwell submitted  that  whilst  the  FTTJ  had
    erred in law, the error was not material. At paragraph 31, the FTTJ had
    made  it  clear  that  there  were  "additional  concerns   about   the
    genuineness of the business"; at paragraph 39  the  FTTJ  endorsed  the
    respondent's view.  That view was set out in the  reasons  for  refusal
    letter, page 2, where the respondent had set out a number of points  as
    to why this was not a genuine business. No concession had been made  at
    the hearing before the FTTJ with regard to  the  admissibility  of  the
    evidence.

 9. In reply, Mr Parkin submitted  that  it  was  not  suggested  that  the
    hearing before the FTTJ had been other than a "poorly run appeal".   It
    was correct that paragraph 31 alluded to additional concerns, but there
    was nothing to indicate that those concerns were sufficient to persuade
    the FTTJ that the appellant was not a genuine businessman or  that  the
    business was not credible.  There was no detailed consideration of  the
    respondent's reasons for refusal.  With regard to paragraph  39,  while
    the FTTJ agreed with the respondent, it was not  clear  the  extent  of
    that agreement, particularly as the FTTJ had found  for  the  appellant
    with regard to the origin of funds.  Even if it  could  be  treated  as
    wholesale agreement, it was not clear on what basis it had been agreed,
    ie whether as a result of the  original  evidence  submitted  with  the
    application, or the inadmissible evidence. Nor have reasons been  given
    on the basis of the original evidence.  Whilst it was accepted that the
    appellant had undermined his case by adducing inadmissible evidence, it
    could not conversely be said that, had he not done so, his appeal would
    have been dismissed anyway. There was the "possibility" he  could  have
    "won his appeal".  This was because the FTTJ had formed a view that the
    inadmissible documents had detracted from  his  credibility,  with  the
    implication that those documents tended to undermine his  case.   Thus,
    without the inadmissible evidence, it was not possible to identify what
    the decision of the FTTJ might have been. "The appellant would have had
    a better shot at success had he not produced the additional  material".
    It was, he submitted, impossible to determine what  the  outcome  would
    have been without them; it could  have  been  more  favourable  to  the
    appellant had the material not been produced.

10. I indicated to the parties that I would find that the  FTTJ's  decision
    taking into account evidence contrary to s85A contained an error of law
    for that reason.  I so find.  I turn to the issue of whether that error
    was material to the outcome of the appeal.

11. There is no statement or finding in  the  FTTJ's  decision  as  to  the
    nature and extent of those documents  which  were  submitted  with  the
    application. Mr Parkin helpfully indicated that it  was  likely  to  be
    those documents listed at paragraph 10 of the decision, but he was  not
    sure that all the submitted documentation  was  listed  there.   Having
    checked the documents produced to the FTTJ, I find that most  of  those
    listed at paragraph 12 as being in the appellant's first bundle  appear
    to be the same as those in the Home Office bundle.  Having also checked
    those listed at paragraph 13 of the decision, I  note  that  these  all
    post-date the appellant's application and  the  respondent's  decision.
    None of the documents listed at paragraph 13 were therefore  admissible
    by the FTTJ.

12. It is submitted for the appellant before  me  that  the  FTTJ  made  an
    adverse credibility finding solely on the  basis  of  the  inadmissible
    evidence. The FTTJ states at paragraph 20 that "The Appellant is not an
    impressive witness.  When asked questions by his  own  Counsel,  by  Mr
    Macrae  or  by  myself,  he  did  not  seem  to  be  able  to  give   a
    straightforward answer, but answered in  vague,  general  terms."   The
    FTTJ then goes on to say

         "21. He was asked by me how it was that a small  business  such  as
         Khan's Kebabs which ran a single unit and  effectively  operated  a
         takeaway could afford to pay �600 per month to him  as  a  business
         consultant.  He could offer no sensible answer  to  this.  He  said
         that the business had six or seven employees working in a  takeaway
         making kebabs, doners and pizzas.  He said he attended meetings  of
         the staff and gave training.  He was  asked  about  the  other  two
         companies, BGN Security and Best  Business  Centre  with  whom  his
         company appeared to have contracts.  He  said  that  Best  Business
         Centre was a travel agency but also  had  a  currency  exchange  in
         Luton. He said he attended meetings, seminars and motivated  people
         at this business.  He was not able to  say  how  many  people  they
         employed.

         22. He said that BGN  Security  Company  had  about  six  or  seven
         employees but he was not able to explain what services he was  able
         to provide to this company."

13. The FTTJ's decision on credibility appears to have been made, at  least
    partially, on the appellant's oral evidence, some of which  relates  to
    inadmissible  evidence,  including  copy   cheques   payable   to   the
    appellant's company and post-dating the application (they are  included
    in the bundle of documents produced at the hearing).

14. Whilst the FTTJ identifies and summarises the issues of concern for the
    respondent and addresses each of these in turn  under  three  headings,
    the FTTJ does not assess the evidence which was before  the  respondent
    at the date of decision; instead the FTTJ identifies  the  respondent's
    concerns and considers  the  evidence  produced  by  the  appellant  to
    address those concerns. That evidence is not admissible. The FTTJ makes
    no specific findings as regards the  evidence  before  the  respondent.
    Whilst the FTTJ refers at paragraph 31 to having  "additional  concerns
    about the genuineness  of  the  business  allegedly  conducted  by  the
    Appellant", it is not stated how and to what  extent  the  FTTJ  agrees
    with the concerns of the respondent and why that is  so.   Instead  the
    FTTJ considers the additional evidence of the appellant  and  makes  an
    assessment of that evidence before agreeing (paragraph  39)  "with  the
    respondent in this case that [he is] not satisfied with the genuineness
    of the alleged business to be carried out by the Appellant."

15. I have been referred  to  the  guidance  in  Ahmad.  As  is  stated  at
    paragraph 5: "the appeal if it is successful is on the basis  that  the
    decision-maker  with  the  material  before  him  should  have  made  a
    different decision, not on the basis that a different way of presenting
    the application would have produced a different decision."

16. In the present case the FTTJ has failed to carry out any assessment  of
    the  material   before   the   respondent's   decision-maker,   instead
    summarising the reasons for  refusal  and  assessing  the  inadmissible
    evidence adduced by the appellant to address the respondent's concerns.
     This is the wrong approach.  As there is no assessment by the FTTJ  of
    the evidence which was before the decision-maker, it is  impossible  to
    say whether the appeal would have been dismissed without  consideration
    of the inadmissible material.  Indeed I  am  also  concerned  that  the
    adverse findings on  credibility  have  been  taken  in  the  light  of
    inadmissible evidence as well  as  the  appellant's  oral  evidence  on
    matters which were before the respondent at the date of decision.

17. As in the case of Ahmed, I am unable to say what  conclusion  the  FTTJ
    would have  reached  if  the  FTTJ  had  not  taken  into  account  the
    inadmissible evidence.  I set aside the FTTJ's decision.  Both parties'
    representatives agreed that in such a situation, the appropriate course
    was for the matter to be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
    fresh hearing. I agree with them, also because it is not  clear  to  me
    what documentary evidence was before the decision-maker at the date  of
    decision. I am unable to ascertain this from the decision of  the  FTTJ
    or the tribunal file.  I consider it necessary to make a direction that
    the appellant produce,  for  the  fresh  hearing,  a  bundle  of  those
    documents which were submitted with his application, so that  the  FTTJ
    who hears the appeal afresh knows  what  evidence  can  be  taken  into
    account.

18. Mr Whitwell, for  the  respondent,  indicated  at  the  outset  of  his
    submissions that he was  minded  to  make  an  application  for  costs.
    However, in the event, he did not  do  so  and  I  have  not  therefore
    considered the matter.

Decision

19. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  The decision is set aside.   The
    appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to be dealt with afresh,
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunal Courts and  Enforcement
    Act 2007 and Practice Statement 7.2(v), before  any  judge  aside  from
    FTTJ Watt.
