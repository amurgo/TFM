Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins instructed by Sentinel Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Appellant, a  national  of  Albania,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 6th January
    2018 refusing her application for asylum and humanitarian protection in
    the UK.  Her appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Gribble
    in a decision promulgated on 8th March 2018 and she  appealed  to  this
    Tribunal with permission.  On 14th March 2019 I set aside the  decision
    made by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Gribble  preserving  all  of  the
    findings of fact made. That decision is appended hereto.

 2. At the resumed hearing on 2nd April 2019 I heard  submissions  from  Mr
    Collins and Mr Avery.  I also take account  of  the  following  further
    evidence submitted for the resumed hearing:

       . submissions on behalf of the Appellant;

       . decision in ES (s.2 NIAA 2002, negative NRM)  Albania  [2018]  UKUT
         00335 (IAC);

       . Appellant's additional  bundle  of  documents  including  Wikipedia
         entrance for Puka, the Appellant's home town and extracts from  the
         Appellant's medical records.

 3. I heard submissions and reserved my decision.

The evidence and hearing

 4. The judge's findings of fact  are  summarised  in  paragraph  4  of  my
    decision on the error of law.  They are also summarised in paragraph  4
    of the Appellant's submissions submitted for the resumed  hearing.   Mr
    Avery accepted that those findings were not in dispute insofar as  they
    went.

 5. In summary the findings of fact are that the Appellant is a 31 year old
    Albanian mother with a 4 year old illegitimate  son.   She  is  from  a
    village in the Puka region of Northern Albania.  She has been  accepted
    as a victim of modern slavery and was trafficked into  prostitution  in
    the UK.  She has a  degree  in  midwifery  obtained  in  July  2011  in
    Albania.  Before she came to the UK she was living with her father  who
    was a violent man.  Her extended family helped  her  make  her  a  visa
    application  and  obtained  false  documents  for  her  in  2013.   The
    Appellant's sister and brother-in-law are wealthy  and  have  supported
    her in the past.

 6. In addition I am satisfied on the  basis  of  the  Appellant's  medical
    records that she has reported  signs  and  symptoms  of  post-traumatic
    stress disorder (counsellor's report 19th August 2015).   She  received
    counselling in the UK in 2015 and 2017.  She has described a history of
    being trafficked into the UK and historical physical abuse as  a  child
    by her father (page 4 additional bundle).  She has been diagnosed  with
    acute stress reaction (page 7 of the  medical  records)  and  has  been
    prescribed antidepressant  medication  over  a  period  of  time.   The
    Appellant is currently undergoing counselling  with  SV  2  (Supporting
    Victims of Sexual Violence).  According to the letter from One  Medical
    Group at page 11 of  the  bundle  the  Appellant  registered  with  her
    current GP on 17th February 2015 and has suffered from a Mixed  anxiety
    and depressive disorder and has reported to the psychological  services
    with signs and symptoms of post-traumatic  stress  disorder.   She  was
    first  prescribed  antidepressant  medication  in   March   2015,   her
    medication was changed in September 2016 and she has remained  on  that
    since.  She has also suffered from chronic  migraines  since  2015  for
    which she has been prescribed medication.

 7. At the hearing before me Mr Avery submitted that the assessment of risk
    in relation to an Albanian  victim  of  trafficking  involves  a  fact-
    sensitive assessment of the Appellant's circumstances.  The question is
    whether the Appellant could realistically be expected to relocate.   In
    his submission there are good reasons in this case why  this  Appellant
    can  reintegrate.   He  submitted  that  the  fact  that  she   has   a
    qualification which could be of use to her, that she  is  not  at  risk
    from her family and could receive some support from them,  for  example
    her sister and brother-in-law who helped her in the past even providing
    her with false ID.  In his submission there is no reason why she  could
    not re-establish contact with her sister and brother-in-law.   Although
    it was found that her  father  was  a  violent  man  he  supported  her
    education, he is divorced from her mother which would suggest that more
    rigid local customs would not apply in this family.  He submitted  that
    it is difficult to see what risk he would pose to  the  Appellant.   He
    pointed out that the judge found at paragraph 65 that the Appellant was
    not at risk from her ex-fiancï¿½ and that he had not been arrested so  it
    was not likely that he would have any reason to find her.  He  accepted
    that there are factors  in  the  Appellant's  favour  for  example  the
    medical evidence, her diagnosis of PTSD, the  fact  that  she  goes  to
    counselling and is taking medication.  However he  submitted  that  the
    doctor's evidence shows that her condition is stable  and  the  medical
    issues are not likely to affect her  on  return  to  Albania.   In  his
    submission on her return she could seek the protection of the State  as
    she could stay in a shelter and seek assistance from the  wider  family
    to help her reintegrating.  He contended that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision did not definitively find that the  Appellant  was  at
    risk in her home area and he contended that there is no risk there.  He
    accepted that the child is another potential risk factor.   However  he
    submitted that this involves a degree of speculation  in  that  if  the
    Appellant has significant support from her family the  child  would  be
    less of an issue for her.

 8. In  response  Mr  Collins  submitted  that  this  is  a  fact-sensitive
    assessment.  In this case the Appellant is  vulnerable,  she  has  been
    accepted to be a victim of modern slavery, she has a  qualification  in
    midwifery but she has never used that and has not gone back to Albania.
     In relation to potential support he submitted that it is difficult  to
    see any support from the Appellant's  sister  and  brother-in-law  just
    because they supported her a number of years ago.   In  his  submission
    that  is  speculative  and  ignores  the  change  in  the   Appellant's
    circumstances in that she now has a child.  He pointed to the  evidence
    in the bundle which shows that the area of Puka  has  its  own  set  of
    kanun law.  There is consistent evidence that the Appellant has had  no
    contact with her family since coming to the UK.  In his submission  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision did find that the Appellant is  at  risk
    in her home area otherwise the judge would not have gone on to consider
    the issue of internal relocation.  In his  submission  it  is  accepted
    that there are shelters available.  However he pointed to the  decision
    in TD and  AD  (trafficked  women)  CG  [2016]  UKUT  00092  (IAC)  and
    paragraph 14 where it states that the time available in  a  shelter  is
    limited.  The risk to the Appellant of re-trafficking would occur after
    then and she is at risk because of  her  vulnerability.   He  submitted
    that the  medical  evidence  showing  her  vulnerability  goes  to  the
    viability of internal relocation after leaving a shelter.  The  medical
    evidence shows that she has a diagnosis of PTSD, has been in receipt of
    psychological therapy  and  suffers  from  severe  migraines.   In  his
    submission there is no evidence that the Appellant's sister and brother-
    in-law could  continue  to  support  her  if  she  were  returned.   He
    highlighted the factors set out in TD and AD at paragraph h of the head
    note the factors set out at 1 to  7  pointing  out  that  although  the
    Appellant is educated she has never  worked.   She  has  mental  health
    issues, she has an illegitimate child, she is from an area where  kanun
    law is applicable and she has no support network.   In  his  submission
    paragraph 182 of AM and BM (trafficked women) Albania  [2010]  UKUT  80
    (IAC)  supports  the  submission  that  there  is  no  sufficiency   of
    protection for the Appellant  in  Albania.   He  highlighted  the  last
    sentence of paragraph 182 which states "if the victim is at  real  risk
    of persecution from her family or her 'husband' then  there  is  little
    evidence that the State would intervene, particularly in the  north  of
    the country".  He highlighted that the Appellant is  likely  to  be  at
    risk when she leaves the shelter (paragraph 106  of  TD  and  AD).   He
    referred to paragraph 112 of TD and AD which he submitted was  directly
    relevant to this case.  Mr Collins referred to the decision in  ES  and
    pointed out that  the  Appellant  in  that  case  was  similar  to  the
    Appellant in this case.  There that Appellant had a University  degree,
    was vulnerable, was a victim of modern slavery and had difficulties  in
    terms of internal relocation.  That Appellant's appeal was allowed.

 9. Mr Collins went on to submit that in the alternative if the appeal  was
    to be considered under Article 8 it should be allowed  under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules on the basis that the  Appellant
    faces very significant obstacles reintegrating in Albania.

My Findings

10. In considering the issues in this appeal I have taken  account  of  the
    country guidance in the case of TD and AD where the Tribunal  gave  the
    following guidance as summarised in the head note:

         "Much of the guidance given in AM & BM (Trafficked  women)  Albania
         CG [2010] UKUT 00080 (IAC) is maintained. Where that  guidance  has
         been  amended  or  supplemented  by  this  decision  it  has   been
         highlighted in bold:

         "a)  It is not possible to set out a typical profile of  trafficked
             women from Albania:  trafficked women come from all  areas  of
             the country and from varied social backgrounds.

         b)   Much of Albanian society is  governed  by  a  strict  code  of
             honour which not only means that trafficked women  would  have
             very considerable difficulty in reintegrating into their  home
             areas on return but also will affect their ability to relocate
             internally. Those  who  have  children  outside  marriage  are
             particularly vulnerable. In extreme cases the close  relatives
             of the trafficked woman may  refuse  to  have  the  trafficked
             woman's child return with her and could force her  to  abandon
             the child.

         c)   Some women are lured to leave Albania with false  promises  of
             relationships or work. Others  may  seek  out  traffickers  in
             order to facilitate their departure  from  Albania  and  their
             establishment in  prostitution  abroad.  Although  such  women
             cannot be said to have left Albania against their will,  where
             they have fallen under the  control  of  traffickers  for  the
             purpose of exploitation there is  likely  to  be  considerable
             violence within the relationships and a lack of freedom:  such
             women are victims of trafficking.

         d)   In the  past  few  years  the  Albanian  government  has  made
             significant efforts to improve its  response  to  trafficking.
             This includes widening the scope  of  legislation,  publishing
             the Standard Operating Procedures, implementing  an  effective
             National Referral Mechanism, appointing a new Anti-trafficking
             Co-ordinator,  and  providing  training  to  law   enforcement
             officials.  There is in general a Horvath-standard sufficiency
             of protection, but it will not be  effective  in  every  case.
             When considering whether or not  there  is  a  sufficiency  of
             protection  for  a  victim  of  trafficking   her   particular
             circumstances must be considered.

         e)   There is now in place a reception and reintegration  programme
             for victims of trafficking. Returning victims  of  trafficking
             are able to stay in a shelter on arrival, and in 'heavy cases'
             may be able to stay there for  up  to  2  years.  During  this
             initial  period  after  return  victims  of  trafficking   are
             supported and protected. Unless the individual has  particular
             vulnerabilities such as physical or mental health issues, this
             option cannot generally be said to be unreasonable; whether it
             is must be determined on a case by case basis.

         f)   Once asked to leave the shelter a victim  of  trafficking  can
             live on her  own.  In  doing  so  she  will  face  significant
             challenges including, but not limited to,  stigma,  isolation,
             financial  hardship  and  uncertainty,  a  sense  of  physical
             insecurity and the subjective fear of being  found  either  by
             their families or former traffickers.  Some  women  will  have
             the capacity  to  negotiate  these  challenges  without  undue
             hardship. There will however be victims  of  trafficking  with
             characteristics,  such  as  mental  illness  or  psychological
             scarring, for whom living alone in these  circumstances  would
             not be reasonable.  Whether a particular appellant falls  into
             that category will call for a careful assessment  of  all  the
             circumstances.

         g)   Re-trafficking is a reality. Whether that risk exists  for  an
             individual claimant will turn in part on the factors that  led
             to the initial trafficking, and on her personal circumstances,
             including her background, age, and her willingness and ability
             to seek help from the authorities. For a proportion of victims
             of trafficking,  their  situations  may  mean  that  they  are
             especially vulnerable to re-trafficking, or being forced  into
             other exploitative situations.

         h)   Trafficked women  from  Albania  may  well  be  members  of  a
             particular social group on that account  alone.  Whether  they
             are at risk of persecution on account of such  membership  and
             whether they will be able to access sufficiency of  protection
             from  the  authorities  will  depend  upon  their   individual
             circumstances including but not limited to the following:

               1) The social status and economic standing of her family

               2) The level of education of the victim of trafficking or her
                  family

               3) The victim of trafficking's state of health,  particularly
                  her mental health

               4) The presence of an illegitimate child

               5) The area of origin

               6) Age

               7) What support network will be available. "

11.  In  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  the  Respondent  rejected  the
    Appellant's claim that she was trafficked from Albania to  the  UK  and
    that she was the subject of an  arranged  marriage  by  her  father  in
    Albania.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that  the  Appellant  had
    been a victim of trafficking for sexual exploitation.  She  found  that
    the Appellant was living with her father who was a violent  man  before
    she came to the UK.  However at paragraph 65 the judge found  that  the
    Appellant was not at risk from the claimed fiancï¿½ or her father.

12. The issues to be determined in light of the facts found  are  therefore
    whether the Appellant has a well-founded fear  of  persecution  in  her
    home area, and, if so, whether there is a sufficiency of protection and
    an internal relocation option in Albania.

13. It has been accepted that the Appellant is a victim of trafficking  for
    sexual exploitation. The appellant is a victim of trafficking and  thus
    a member of a particular social group in Albania.

14. I take account of the conclusion of the Upper Tribunal  in  TD  and  AD
    that the Albanian government has made significant  efforts  to  improve
    its response to trafficking and that there is "in  general  a  Horvath-
    standard sufficiency of protection, but it will  not  be  effective  in
    every case". In accordance with the guidance I consider the appellant's
    personal circumstances when considering  whether  or  not  there  is  a
    sufficiency of protection for her as a victim of trafficking.

15. I have considered all of the evidence and submissions in light  of  the
    factors set out in TD and AD (above) in assessing whether the appellant
    can access a sufficiency of protection. The  Appellant's  father  is  a
    violent man, he is of poor economic standing [62]. However  her  sister
    and brother-in-law financed her journey to the UK  and  must  therefore
    have access to funds. However the Appellant has been consistent in  her
    account that she has had no contact with her family  in  Albania  since
    leaving there in 2013 and I accept her account. The Appellant qualified
    as a midwife but I accept her evidence that she has never worked  as  a
    midwife in Albania, she said that she was  not  allowed  to  work.  The
    Appellant has been diagnosed with Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder
    and has signs and symptoms  of  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder.  She
    undertook counselling and was prescribed medication for depression. She
    is on medication for chronic migraines. Her mental and physical  health
    issues are relevant factors which would exacerbate her vulnerability on
    return.  The Appellant is from a rural area outside Puka in  the  North
    of Albania, an area with its own Kanun  laws.   The  Appellant  has  an
    illegitimate child. I take account of the guidance in AM  &  BM  and  I
    accept that, in the North of Albania in particular, the fact  that  the
    Appellant has an illegitimate child is likely to contravene the  strict
    code of honour and place her at risk.   I  accept  that  there  is  not
    likely to be a sufficiency of protection from the authorities  in  this
    situation (paragraph 182 AM & BM). I accept  the  Appellant's  evidence
    that she has had no contact with her family since leaving  Albania  and
    that she would therefore have no family support on  return  there.  She
    has not been in contact with anyone  in  Albania  and  has  no  support
    there. I find that, in the appellant's case, these factors,  identified
    in TD and AD as being relevant to  the  assessment  of  sufficiency  of
    protection, all lead to the conclusion that the Appellant is at risk of
    persecution in her home area ant that she would be unable to  access  a
    sufficiency of protection there.

Internal relocation

16. It is clear that the factors identified in TD and AD (above)  are  also
    relevant to the assessment as to whether it is  unduly  harsh  for  the
    appellant to internally relocate within Albania. I take account of  the
    factors identified above and, in  particular,  the  appellant's  mental
    health issues. I also take into  account  the  fact  that  she  has  an
    illegitimate child. The Appellant may be able to access  a  shelter  in
    Tirana for a limited period (paragraph 105 TD and AD). However when she
    leaves she would have to set up on her own and she is  likely  to  face
    further difficulties then according to paragraph 106 of TD and AD:

         "All of the evidence before us indicates that in this period  women
         face numerous obstacles, that include,  but  are  not  limited  to:
         financial hardship, difficulty in  finding  secure  employment  and
         housing, poverty, discrimination and stigma (pertaining to the  VOT
         as well as any children she  might  have),  isolation  and  no,  or
         severely restricted, access to mental health services.  As will  be
         seen below it is argued  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  that  the
         cumulative effect  of  such  factors  renders  internal  flight  as
         unreasonable  for  many  VOTs;  it  is  further  argued  that   the
         vulnerability of a VOT at this point places her at an  unacceptably
         high risk of re-trafficking or other harm."

17. At paragraph 109 the Tribunal considered the prospects for  many  women
    after leaving the shelters:

         "For less  resilient  or  adaptable  women  however,  the  path  to
         financial  independence  is  not  so  straightforward.    Professor
         Haxhiymeri describes the assistance offered by  the  shelters,  the
         Albanian government or the IOM as "superficial" and  stressed  that
         such training packages rarely help  women  in  the  long  run.  The
         problem she identifies is that women in Albania tend to  find  work
         in the low-skilled, informal sector where employment is not  secure
         or protected, and where wages rarely keep  up  with  the  costs  of
         living: this is the "grey economy" discussed in AM & BM[1]. All  of
         the evidence supports a finding that the financial constraints make
         survival in the cities difficult: we accept Professor  Haxhiymeri's
         evidence of her personal experience of trying to find accommodation
         for survivors of domestic violence. Workers at  her  NGO  typically
         find that the cost of basic accommodation in Tirana,  even  in  the
         outskirts, is E200 per month  whereas  a  woman  working  in  those
         conditions will typically earn no more than E150.  The  respondents
         to the research consistently reported that it is  "very  difficult"
         to live alone because of the financial constraints women  face,  in
         particular in staying in employment and in paying  rent.   The  UNP
         report confirms that there is no provision for VOTs to have  access
         to social housing, and that they are therefore forced  to  rent  in
         the private sector. The high unemployment rate  means  that  people
         are forced  to  take  "any  kind  of  job".  The  Needs  Assessment
         succinctly summarises this situation: "most victims  are  returning
         to the same place, facing the same problems that  they  had  before
         they were trafficked". The difference now being that they must face
         such daily grind whilst living with the physical, psychological and
         social consequences of that experience."

18. I also take account of paragraph 11 where the Tribunal concluded:

          "... Women living on their own are likely to be socially distinct.
          Whilst discrimination and stigma certainly  exist  they  will  not
         generally constitute persecutory "serious harm" or  breach  Article
         3, but this it nevertheless a factor to be considered  cumulatively
         when assessing whether internal flight is reasonable for any  given
         appellant. "

19. I take particular account of the Appellant's mental and physical health
    issues, the fact that she is from the  North  of  Albania  and  has  no
    family support and the fact that she has an illegitimate child.  Taking
    account of all relevant factors relating to this Appellant  I  conclude
    that it would be unduly harsh for her to relocate within Albania.

20. I find that in these circumstances that the Appellant  has  established
    that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Albania.

Humanitarian Protection

21. In light of my conclusion in relation to asylum there  is  no  need  to
    make findings as to Humanitarian Protection.

Articles 2 & 3

22. In this appeal Articles 2 and 3 stand or fall with the asylum claim. In
    light of my findings above I  am  satisfied  that  if  she  returns  to
    Albania the appellant may be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading
    treatment or punishment or face death in breach of Articles 2 or  3  of
    the ECHR.

Article 8

23. In light of my findings above  I  am  satisfied  that  there  are  very
    significant obstacles to the Appellant's integration in Albania and the
    Appellant comes within paragraph 276ADE (1)  (vi)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. I therefore allow the appeal under Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed on asylum and on human rights grounds.

To the Respondent
Fee Award

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of any fee which has been paid or may be  payable  because  the  Appellant's
circumstances have not changed since the Respondent's decision was made.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins, instructed by Sentinel Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Appellant, a  national  of  Albania,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 6th January
    2018 refusing her application for asylum and humanitarian protection in
    the UK.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Gribble dismissed the  appeal  in  a
    decision promulgated on 8th March 2018.  The Appellant now  appeals  to
    this Tribunal with permission granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Chalkley
    on 4th December 2018.

 2. There were essentially two Grounds of Appeal.  It is contended  in  the
    first ground that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in  her  approach
    to the assessment of risk on return and internal relocation in light of
    the findings of fact made.  It is contended in the second  ground  that
    the judge erred in her approach to the medical evidence.

 3. I find that the first ground is made out.  In her  decision  the  judge
    made a number of findings of fact.  The judge made a number of negative
    findings and, in summary, did not accept the Appellant's account as  to
    when she entered the UK and found that she  entered  the  UK  in  April
    2013.  The judge did not accept that  the  Appellant  left  Albania  to
    escape a forced engagement to  a  man  she  did  not  know.  The  judge
    highlighted a  number  of  inconsistent  features  in  the  Appellant's
    account.  The  judge  did  not  accept  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    forbidden to work in Albania [56].

 4. However  the  judge  did  accept  a  number  of  key  elements  of  the
    Appellant's claim.  The judge accepted that the Appellant was  deceived
    as to the purpose of her coming to the UK and that she  was  forced  to
    work as a prostitute here.  The judge found that she  is  a  victim  of
    trafficking and is therefore a member of  a  particular  social  group.
    The judge found that the Appellant has a degree in  midwifery  obtained
    in July 2011.  She found that the Appellant was living with her father,
    a violent man, before she came to the UK [59].  She also found that the
    Appellant's extended family helped her make  her  visa  application  in
    2011 and found false documents for her  in  2013  and  found  that  the
    Appellant's sister and brother-in-law are wealthy and supportive of her
    [59].

 5. The judge went on to apply the guidance in the decision in  TD  and  AD
    (Trafficked women) CG [2016] UKUT 00092 (IAC) setting out  the  factors
    she took into account at paragraphs 61 to 67.  These included the  fact
    that the Appellant is not at risk from her family or from Fred (the man
    she said trafficked her); that she is an  educated  30-year-old  woman;
    that there is no up-to-date evidence that  she  is  engaged  in  active
    treatment in relation to her mental health (although  it  was  accepted
    that she is taking current standard  antidepressant  medication);  that
    the Appellant is from a family who supported her  education  to  degree
    level and had the finances to support the application for a study  visa
    and obtaining ID documents to try to get to the UK; and that, while her
    father may be of poor economic standing, there are family  members  who
    are not and who have access to funds.  The judge referred to  the  lack
    of evidence in relation to the Appellant's mental health and  concluded
    that she does not have a serious mental illness [64].  The  judge  took
    into account the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had  been  able  to  make
    friendships in the UK and had undertaken a freedom programme in the UK.
     The judge was satisfied that the Appellant would  be  able  to  access
    support on return to Albania from a  shelter  or  from  her  sister  or
    brother-in-law who she described as wealthy [66].  The judge noted that
    there was no evidence that their circumstances  have  changed  or  they
    would not be willing to help her as they have in the  past  by  way  of
    providing accommodation  or  short-term  financial  support  [66].   At
    paragraph 67 the judge found that  the  Appellant  is  able  to  safely
    parent her son and provide him with  good  enough  care  and  that  the
    presence of her son  would  be  "an  additional  feature"  however  she
    concluded overall that there are viable means of support  available  to
    the Appellant and provided by the authorities  for  her  on  return  to
    Tirana.

 6. In my view there are two issues arising from the judge's analysis.  The
    first is that the judge's conclusions on the asylum issue are  unclear.
    The judge made no clear finding as to whether the appellant is at  risk
    in her home area. It is unclear whether the consideration at paragraphs
    61-68 is in the context of risk on return to her home area or  internal
    relocation to Tirana. The second issue is that in considering  risk  on
    return or internal relocation, the judge failed to properly  factor  in
    the problems the Appellant would face as a victim of modern day slavery
    and the mother of an illegitimate child.  Although at paragraph 67  the
    judge said that the  presence  of  the  Appellant's  son  would  be  an
    additional factor it is not clear that this was properly considered  in
    light of the case law. The grounds of appeal refer to the  case  of  AM
    and BM (Trafficked women) Albania [2010] UKUT 80 (IAC) which refers  to
    the rigid patriarchal culture of much of Albania particularly the rural
    areas across the north and the strict code of honour  embodied  in  the
    Kanun.  Reference is also  made  to  the  decision  in  TD  and  AD  to
    paragraph 111 in relation to difficulties faced by women on their  own.
    I note in particular paragraph (b) of the headnote in  TD  and  AD,  as
    cited at paragraph  60  of  the  judge's  decision,  which  relates  to
    difficulties faced by women who have children outside marriage.  In  my
    view the judge's consideration of this issue at paragraph  67  was  not
    adequate.

 7. Ms Jones did not disagree with my analysis that the  judge's  reasoning
    in relation to whether the Appellant could return to her home  area  or
    relocate to Tirana was unclear and that  it  was  unclear  whether  the
    judge had considered where the sister and brother-in-law lived and  how
    much  support  they  could  provide.   Mr   Collins   highlighted   the
    Appellant's responses to questions 162 and 164 of the asylum  interview
    where she said that she had no contact with any  of  her  family  since
    leaving.

 8. I find that the judge made a material error of law in her assessment of
    risk on return to this Appellant in light  of  the  findings  made.   I
    preserve all of the findings of fact which were not  challenged  and  I
    set aside the decision.

Directions

 1) I adjourn the appeal until 2nd April 2018 for a hearing to  remake  the
    decision.

 2) No interpreter is required.

 3) The parties are directed to file with the Tribunal and  serve  on  each
    other any further documentation to be relied on at the resumed  hearing
    no later than five days before the date of hearing.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
