Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S McTaggart, Counsel, instructed by Madden &
                    Finucane Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Thailand, born on 5 March 1981.

2.   The appellant was last admitted to the United Kingdom on 9 May 2012  on
    a family visit visa valid until 5 November 2012.  On 18 September  2012
    she sought a derivative residence card on the basis that  she  was  the
    primary carer of a British citizen  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    namely her son Bobby Quinn (a minor).

3.   That application was refused by a decision of 30  August  2013  on  the
    basis that she had failed to demonstrate that she was the primary carer
    in the matter.

4.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox on 28 July 2014.

5.   The appellant adopted her statement and gave oral evidence as  did  her
    mother-in-law Etta Quinn.

6.   It was the finding of the Judge at paragraph 12  of  the  determination
    that it was clear from the appellant's evidence and that of the child's
    grandparent, that prior  to  the  appellant's  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom they (the grandparents) were exclusively  responsible  for  the
    child's welfare and upbringing, a process which continued.

7.   The primary challenge to  the  determination  is  that  the  Judge  has
    misunderstood or misstated the evidence that had been presented by  the
    appellant and  by   Etta  Quinn.   In  summary,  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant was that prior to coming to the United Kingdom she lived with
    her fianc� Steven Quinn (now deceased) since 2005.  Bobby was  born  in
    2008 and thereafter he  remained  in  Thailand.   Her  fianc�  came  to
    England because he had to undergo an operation.  Bobby lived  with  him
    with a number of visits made to  Thailand.   Unfortunately  in  one  of
    those visits the fianc� Steven was killed in a  motorbike  accident  in
    Thailand.  Thus it was that the appellant had returned to the  UK  with
    Bobby.  She made it clear in her evidence, and indeed the  evidence  is
    clear from that of the grandparent that she, Bobby and the grandparents
    lived together and she the appellant took the primary decisions.

8.   It was on the basis therefore that  the  Judge  had  misunderstood  the
    evidence that grounds of appeal were lodged and  permission  to  appeal
    was granted.

9.   Mr McTaggart, who represents the appellant,  invited  my  attention  to
    the written evidence and presented also for my attention a note of  the
    oral evidence that had been compiled by the solicitor in attendance  at
    the First-tier Tribunal.  It is clear and indeed most  fairly  accepted
    as being so by Mr Shilliday, who represents the respondent,  that  what
    the appellant said about her involvement and responsibility  for  Bobby
    was quite at variance with what was set out in the determination.

10.  It was conceded by all parties that  in those circumstances it  was  an
    error of law to misstate the evidence to such  a  degree.   Accordingly
    the decision is set aside.

11.  Given that further evidence may well be required and argument  directed
    on the issue of primary responsibility and care, it is appropriate  and
    in accordance with paragraph  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Directions, that the matter be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for
    a rehearing on the evidence as presented.  Indeed there may need to  be
    further or updated evidence as to  the  child's  progress  and  to  the
    responsibility of the various parties for his upbringing.

12.  In those circumstances therefore the appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal
    is allowed. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall be set  aside
    to be made upon a subsequent rehearing.
