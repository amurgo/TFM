                            DECISION AND REASONS








BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The 1st Appellant is a national of Bangladesh. She entered  the  United
    Kingdom, as a student, on 15 September 2009 and her leave to remain was
    extended on the same basis in 2012 and 2013. When  applying  for  these
    periods of leave, the 1st Appellant satisfied the Respondent  that  she
    had sufficient funds to pay for her course fees and support herself and
    any                                                          dependent.




2.   The 1st Appellant married the 2nd Appellant in Luton on 4  August  2012
    and on 25 August 2015 the 1st Appellant applied for a  residence  card.
    as the extended family member of her uncle, Murshed  Ahmed.  He  is  an
    Italian national, who had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2014.    The
    2nd Appellant was a dependent to her application.  On 8 February  2016,
    the Respondent refused the 1st Appellant's application.

3.   The Appellants appealed but First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer  dismissed
    their appeal in a decision promulgated on 15 June  2017  on  the  basis
    that the First-tier Tribunal did not  have  the  jurisdiction  to  hear
    appeals by those relying on their rights as extended family members  of
    EEA nationals.  Permission to appeal against this decision was  granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chamberlain on 23  November  2017  in  the
    light of the decision in  Khan  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. In a decision, promulgated on 26 March
    2018, the appeal was remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Murray.

4.   The appeal was then listed before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Griffith
    and she refused their application  for  an  adjournment  and  dismissed
    their appeal in a decision promulgated on 25 October  2018.  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Grimmett refused the Appellants permission to appeal  on
    15 November 2018 but on 17 January 2019  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Taylor did grant them permission to appeal.  This was on the basis that
    it was arguable that the Appellants were  prejudiced  the  decision  to
    refuse them an adjournment.





ERROR OF LAW HEARING

5.   Both counsel for the Appellant and the Home Office  Presenting  Officer
    made oral submissions and I have  referred  to  the  content  of  these
    submissions, where relevant, in my decision below.


ERROR OF LAW DECISION

6.   Regulation 8 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") is headed 'Extended  Family  Member'  and
    states that:

     "(1) In these Regulations 'extended family member' means a  person  who
    is not a family  member  of  an  EEA  National...and  who  satisfies  a
    condition in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).
      (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the  person
    is a relative of an EEA    national...and
         (a)  the person is residing in a  country  other  than  the  United
    Kingdom...and is           dependent upon the  EEA  national  or  is  a
    member of his household;
         (b)  the person satisfied the condition in  paragraph  (a)  and  is
    accompanying the EEA             national  to  the  United  Kingdom  or
    wishes to join him there..."

7.   In paragraph 22 of  his  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes
    accepted that the 1st Appellant was related to her  uncle  as  claimed.
    There was also a copy of her uncle's Italian passport in the Appellants
    Bundle.

8.   At the hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith, there was  no
    Home Office Presenting Officer  present  and  the  Appellants  had  not
    previously  been  served  with  a  copy  of  the  Respondent's  Bundle.
    Therefore,  the  Appellants'  legal  representative  applied   for   an
    adjournment. First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith  refused  to  grant  an
    adjournment but provided the Appellants' legal  representative  with  a
    copy of the Respondent's Bundle and put the case back in the list.  The
    hearing started at 3.20 p.m. and lasted until 3.55 p.m.

9.   In the grounds of appeal, the Appellants submitted  that  the  decision
    to refuse them an adjournment was unlawful and  procedurally  improper.
    They relied on Nwaigwe (adjournmenet: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC)
    where the Upper Tribunal found that:

     "If a Tribunal refuses  to  accede  to  an  adjournment  request,  such
    decision could, in principle, be erroneous in law in several  respects:
    these  include  a  failure  to   take   into   account   all   material
    considerations;  permitting  immaterial  considerations   to   intrude;
    denying the party concerned  a  fair  hearing;  failing  to  apply  the
    correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most cases  the
    question will be whether the refusal deprived the affected party of his
    right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal is challenged on
    fairness grounds, it is important to recognise that  the  question  for
    the Upper Tribunal is not whether the FtT  acted  reasonably.   Rather,
    the test to be applied is that of fairness:  was there any  deprivation
    of the affected party's right to a fair hearing? See SH (Afghanistan) v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284".

10.  In Nwaigwe, the Upper Tribunal also found  that  "as  a  general  rule,
    good reason will  have  to  be  demonstrated  in  order  to  secure  an
    adjournment".

11.   Rule  4(3)(h)  of  The  Tribunal   Procedure   (First-tier   Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014  ("the  Procedure  Rules")
    provides a First-tier Tribunal Judge  with  a  discretionary  power  to
    grant a party an adjournment but does not specify the  basis  on  which
    such an adjournment should be granted. Instead, the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge is required  to  take  into  account  the  overriding  objectives
    contained in Rule 2 of the Procedure Rules.  Rule 2(2)  refers  to  the
    need to deal with cases fairly and justly. This includes "ensuring,  so
    far as practicable, that the parties are able to fully  participate  in
    the proceedings" and "avoiding delay, so far as compatible with  proper
    consideration of the issues"

12.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith did  not  explicitly  refer  to  the
    Procedure Rules, but this was not necessarily a  procedural  breach  if
    she reminded herself that she had a discretionary power to adjourn  and
    applied the overriding objectives. In paragraph  12  of  her  decision,
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith noted that  an  application  for  an
    adjournment was made and refused.  She did not elaborate on her reasons
    in her record of proceedings but did indicate that the Appellants' case
    was put back to the end of the list and was not heard until 3.20 in the
    afternoon. However, at the hearing before me counsel for the Appellants
    provided me  with  a  copy  of  the  attendance  note  written  by  the
    Appellants' legal  representative  at  the  hearing  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Griffith.

13.  This  note  confirmed  that  the  Judge  had  been  informed  that  the
    Appellants had not received a copy of the Respondent's bundle and  that
    the sponsor was not present. It also confirmed that the Judge gave  the
    Appellants' legal representative a copy of the Respondent's Bundle  and
    that the legal representative did not raise any issues in  relation  to
    the content of the Bundle. As the case was put back in  the  list,  the
    legal representative would have had sufficient time to read  the  short
    bundle and take any instructions on its contents  from  the  Appellants
    who were present at the hearing.  The legal representative's note  also
    indicated that he did not raise any issues about the documents  in  the
    Respondent's Bundle. The Bundle itself  only  contained  their  initial
    application with supporting  evidence,  their  grounds  of  appeal  and
    previous decisions which had been sent to them.  The  contents  of  the
    Bundle were also referred to in the refusal letter.

14.  Therefore, the fact that the Appellants did not initially  have  access
    to the Respondent's Bundle cannot be said to have  given  rise  to  any
    unfairness as First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith provided them  with  a
    copy of the Bundle and gave their legal representative time to take any
    necessary instructions. In addition, there  was  a  copy  of  the  very
    detailed grounds of appeal against the decision to refuse to grant them
    residence cards in the file. This indicated that the Appellants, though
    their legal representatives, already understood  the  case  being  made
    against them by the Respondent.

15.  The sponsor was not present at  the  hearing  and  the  Appellants  had
    explained to the Judge that his child was ill. No medical  evidence  to
    confirm that this was the case was provided at the hearing  or  at  any
    time since the hearing. His absence  could  only  have  given  rise  to
    unfairness if this meant that evidence  essential  to  the  Appellants'
    case was not before the Tribunal. The sponsor had  already  provided  a
    short witness statement and there was no evidence which indicated  that
    he intended to provide any further evidence at the hearing, which would
    have made a material  impact  on  the  outcome  of  their  appeal.  The
    disclosure of the attendance note also revealed that the Appellants had
    applied for an adjournment at some point prior to  the  appeal  hearing
    but this application had been refused by a Duty Judge. Therefore, there
    was no reasonable basis for asserting that the  sponsor  believed  that
    the hearing would not proceed because the Appellants  did  not  have  a
    copy of the Respondent's Bundle.

16.  In addition, the Appellants did not assert that the sponsor  had  other
    documentary evidence, which he was bringing to the appeal hearing,  and
    on which they wished to rely.  The record of proceedings also indicates
    that there was no question which the 1st  Appellant  was  not  able  to
    answer without her uncle being present.

17.  In these circumstances, there was no basis on which it was "unfair"  or
    procedurally improper to continue with the hearing in his absence.

18.  The grounds of appeal also assert that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    erred in law because the sponsor  was  not  present  for  a  legitimate
    reason. As stated above, there was no medical evidence to  confirm  the
    reason for his absence. But, more importantly, the Appellants  did  not
    particularise any material detriment to their appeal arising  from  his
    absence. Therefore, I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith  did
    not err in law when she refused to grant an adjournment.

19.  The Appellants have  not  sought  to  adduce  any  further  documentary
    evidence under rules 15 (2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 and their grounds of appeal do not challenge the substantive
    decision reached by First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith.

20.  In relation to the substantive decision, I note that the 1st  Appellant
    asserted that before she came the United  Kingdom  as  a  student,  her
    sponsor sent her money on a regular basis. The only evidence that  this
    was the case was a statement for the savings account held  by  the  1st
    Appellant at the Janata Bank Limited for the period from the 1st  March
    to 30 August 2009. This confirmed that her uncle had made  six  monthly
    cash deposits into  her  account  of  Tk  15,000  for  the  six  months
    immediately prior to her commencing her studies in the United  Kingdom.



21.  In paragraph 7 of his witness statement,  dated  8  October  2018,  her
    sponsor went no further than to assert that she  had  been  financially
    dependent upon him since she was in Bangladesh and that he had provided
    her with money from time to time.   He also asserted that after he came
    to the United Kingdom the 1st Appellant came to live with  him  and  he
    gave her money, as required.  In her letter of  application,  dated  28
    August 2015, the 1st Applicant said that sometimes he gave her cash and
    sometimes he paid money into her Santander account. However, there  was
    only one statement from this account and this was for the period 8 July
    to 7 August 2015 and showed one credit to her account by her uncle  for
    �100 and one for �90 and all but �10 of this  money  was  withdrawn  in
    cash with a matter of one or two days.  There was also a  cash  account
    statement for a Lloyds Bank account held by the 1st Appellant's  uncle,
    which showed that he had sent her �80 on 12 August 2015,

22.   Furthermore,  in  paragraph  8  of  her  witness  statement,  the  1st
    Appellant disclosed that her uncle was still living in Italy  when  she
    came to the United Kingdom as a student and, in his statement, he  said
    that he only moved to the United Kingdom at the end of 2014.  There was
    also no evidence to confirm when her uncle, who was born in Bangladesh,
    became an Italian citizen. The copy of his passport indicated  that  it
    had only been issued to him on 17 September 2014 and there was no other
    evidence to show that he had been an EEA national prior to that date.

23.  In  all  the  circumstances  I  find  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Griffith did not err in law when she refused to grant the Appellants an
    adjournment and went on to dismiss their appeals.


DECISION

(1)  The Appellants' appeal is dismissed.

(2)  The decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith stands.
