Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Pipe, instructed by Premier Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing  Mr  Zajaczkowski's  appeal
against the decision to deport him  from  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
regulation 19(3)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
2006 ("the EEA Regulations").

For the purposes  of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary of State as the respondent and Mr Zajaczkowski as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of Poland, born on 26 March 1985. He  claimed  to
have arrived in the United Kingdom in January 2006 and  first  came  to  the
adverse attention of the authorities in  the  United  Kingdom  when  he  was
arrested in connection with the index offence  of  cultivating  cannabis,  a
Class C controlled drug,  on  4  December  2012.  On  28  May  2013  he  was
convicted at  Luton  and  South  Bedfordshire  Magistrates  Court  of  being
concerned in the production of Class B Controlled Drug and on 28  June  2013
he was sentenced at Luton Crown Court to 12 months imprisonment and  ordered
to pay a victim surcharge of ï¿½100. On 16 July 2013  he  was  served  with  a
liability for deportation notice and on  23  December  2013  the  respondent
made a decision to deport him under regulation 21 of the EEA Regulations.

In the reasons for deportation letter, the respondent  considered  that  the
evidence  submitted  by  the  appellant  was  insufficient  to  confirm  his
continuous residence and employment of five years  in  accordance  with  the
EEA Regulations and  that  he  had  therefore  not  acquired  the  right  to
permanent residence. Although he had been assessed as a low risk of harm  in
a NOMS 1 assessment the respondent considered that  he  nevertheless  had  a
propensity  to  re-offend  and  that  he  posed  a  genuine,   present   and
sufficiently serious threat to  the  interests  of  public  policy.  It  was
considered further that his deportation  would  not  breach  his  Article  8
rights under the ECHR.

The appellant appealed against that decision and his  appeal  was  heard  in
the First-tier Tribunal on 2 April 2014 by a panel consisting of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Hollingworth and Mrs R  M  Bray  JP.  On  the  basis  of  the
documentary evidence before them, the panel found  that  the  appellant  had
arrived in the United Kingdom  in  January  2007  and  had  been  exercising
treaty rights since that time. Accordingly they accepted that  by  the  time
of the index offence he had acquired the right  of  permanent  residence  in
the United Kingdom. They therefore went on to consider the second  level  of
seriousness under the EEA Regulations. They noted that  he  had  a  daughter
from his previous marriage but currently had no contact with  her  and  that
he had a child born on 11 December 2013 from a current relationship.  Having
considered his circumstances in the  United  Kingdom  and  in  Poland,  they
concluded that his conduct did not satisfy the  "serious  grounds"  test  in
Regulation 21(3) and they allowed the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

The respondent sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  two
grounds: that the Tribunal  had  failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for
finding that the appellant had acquired  a  permanent  right  of  residence,
given the gaps in the evidence of continuous lawful residence; and that  the
Tribunal had failed to provide adequate reasons why the appellant's  conduct
did not meet either the threshold of serious grounds  of  public  policy  or
security or the lowest threshold of grounds of public policy.

Permission to appeal was initially refused, but was subsequently granted  on
22 May 2014  on  the  grounds  that  in  view  of  the  large  gaps  in  the
documentary  evidence  relating  to  continuous  residence  the  panel   had
arguably erred in finding that the appellant had been living in  the  United
Kingdom for a continuous period of five years.

Appeal hearing and submissions

Mr Avery accepted that the appellant had produced,  at  the  hearing  before
the First-tier Tribunal, a page that had been missing from  the  documentary
evidence which covered the missing period and satisfactorily  addressed  the
first ground of appeal. With regard to the second ground, he submitted  that
whilst there was a lengthy assessment of the facts, the assessment  of  risk
was superficial and accordingly flawed.

Mr Pipe submitted that there had been a proper assessment  of  risk  and  he
referred to the relevant parts of the determination.

Mr Avery, in response, reiterated the points previously made.

Consideration and findings.

As Mr Avery helpfully conceded, it is plain that the missing  page  produced
before the First-tier Tribunal to  complete  the  appeal  bundle  previously
submitted did indeed cover the missing period of time  relied  upon  by  the
respondent in concluding that the appellant had not demonstrated five  years
of continuous residence exercising treaty  rights  in  the  United  Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Tribunal was  entitled  to  find  that  the  appellant  had
demonstrated the relevant period and had thus acquired a right of  permanent
residence in the United Kingdom. The Tribunal therefore properly  considered
the appellant's  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  second  level  of
seriousness under regulation 21(3), namely that "3) A relevant decision may
not be taken in respect of a person with  a  permanent  right  of  residence
under regulation 15 except on serious grounds of  public  policy  or  public
security."

The  only  remaining  ground  of  appeal  challenges  the  Tribunal's   risk
assessment, which Mr Avery submitted was superficial and flawed.  I  do  not
agree, but consider that the grounds amount in  essence  to  a  disagreement
with the Tribunal's decision. At paragraphs 26 to 61  the  panel  considered
the appellant's circumstances in some detail, taking account of  the  nature
of the index offence, his lack of previous criminal history,  his  behaviour
in prison, the risk assessments in the pre-sentence report and  the  NOMS  1
assessment, his remorse, his efforts at rehabilitation, his compliance  with
the conditions of his licence and his  family  relationships.  It  is  clear
that the panel gave careful  consideration  to  all  relevant  matters  when
considering risk and they were entitled to conclude, on the evidence  before
them, that his conduct did not meet the level  of  seriousness  required  to
justify his deportation under regulation 21(3).

Accordingly I find that the Tribunal did not make any errors of law  in  its
decision. It was entitled to reach the decision that it did.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision. The  Secretary  of
State's appeal is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
allow Mr Zajaczkowski's appeal stands.
