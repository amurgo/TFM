                       (anonymity direction NOT made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 20 October  1988.  His
    appeal against the refusal of a residence card as  an  extended  family
    member was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Shanahan on  6  March
    2020.

2.   On 19 February  2020,  the  Appellant's  representative  wrote  to  the
    Tribunal requesting an adjournment on the basis that the Appellant  had
    an outstanding human rights appeal  (HU/18626/2019)  and  both  appeals
    should be heard together. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shanahan  made  no
    reference to this application and determined the EEA appeal  without  a
    hearing

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bird  on
    26 June 2020 on the ground it was arguable  the  judge's  decision  was
    procedurally unfair. In her Rule 24 response,  the  Respondent  invited
    the Tribunal to determine the appeal  with  a  fresh  oral  hearing  to
    consider whether the Appellant was an extended family  member  for  the
    reasons given in the representations  dated  26  August  2020  by  Zane
    Malik. The Respondent agreed it would be prudent for the appeal  to  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal and  linked  to  the  human  rights
    appeal. The Respondent adopted a neutral  stance  in  relation  to  any
    alleged procedural unfairness.

4.   I find that there has been a procedural irregularity  amounting  to  an
    error of law such that the decision dated 6 March 2020  should  be  set
    aside under Rule 43 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008. None of  the  judge's  findings  are  preserved.  The  appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing.

5.   I direct that this appeal is linked  to  HU/18626/2019  and  should  be
    listed before the same judge to be heard on the same day.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because the Appellant's appeal remains outstanding.
