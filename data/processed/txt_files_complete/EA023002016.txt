                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge E. M. M. Smith, promulgated  on  29th  March  2017,  following  a
    hearing at Bennett House, Stoke-on-Trent on 22nd March  2017.   In  the
    determination, the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon
    the Respondent Secretary of State subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Denmark,  and  was  born  on  4th
    March 1963.   He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 6th January 2016, refusing his application for
    a residence card, as confirmation of his right  to  reside  in  the  UK
    under  Regulation  5  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he has been a worker in the UK since 30th
    July 2014, which made him a qualified person as defined  by  Regulation
    6.  The fact that he has subsequently been  in  receipt  of  a  carer's
    allowance  for  the  purposes  of  looking  after  his  wife  does  not
    disqualify him from the status of being a worker.  The  Respondent  has
    claimed that the Appellant has not established that for  the  preceding
    five years he was a  worker  such  as  to  satisfy  the  provisions  of
    Regulation 15(1)(a) of  the  2006  Regulations.   The  Respondent  also
    asserts that the Appellant has not provided any evidence  to  establish
    that he was exercising treaty rights from the 20th March  2009  to  2nd
    March 2015.  It was accepted that from 30th July 2014 the Appellant was
    established as a worker.  The sole issue  before  Judge  Smith  in  the
    appeal that was heard on 22nd March 2017 was whether being  in  receipt
    of a carer's allowance entitles one to be treated as a worker  for  the
    purposes of the Regulations.

The Judge's Findings

 4. There was no authority on the specific question  of  whether  being  in
    receipt of a carer's allowance disqualifies one  from  being  a  worker
    that Judge Smith could rely upon.  Account was had to the fact that the
    carer's allowance requires the recipient to spend at least 35  hours  a
    week caring for someone, not be in full-time education, not be studying
    for 21 hours a week or more, and not earning  more  than  �110  a  week
    after taxes.

 5. The judge had regard also to the fact that for the purposes of Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules, paragraph E-ECP3.3 accepts that  being  in
    receipt  of  a  carer's  allowance  for  the  purposes   of   financial
    requirements of paragraph E-ECP.3.1 does not require one to demonstrate
    that one has income of �18,600 per annum as is normally the case.

 6. The definition of a worker was set out in the well-known case of Genc v
    Land Berlin [C-14/09] where the court held that the concept of a worker
    must not be interpreted narrowly  and  that  "any  person  who  pursues
    activities which are real and genuine to the exclusion of activities on
    such a small scale as to be purely  marginal  and  ancillary,  must  be
    regarded as a 'worker'".  It was  also  confirmed  in  D.  M.  Levin  v
    Staatssecretaris  van  Justice  (C-53/81)  that  "the  activity  as  an
    employed person may not be defined by reference to the national laws of
    member states but have a community meaning".

 7. The judge was concerned by the fact that  there  is  a  requirement  of
    working at least 35 hours a week to be committed to care with a maximum
    weekly wage of �62.10, but this was less than the national minimum wage
    of �7.50 per hour, and it therefore raised the question  whether  being
    in receipt of a carer's allowance can  be  regarded  as  a  reward  for
    employment, in cases where of the national minimum  wage  will  not  be
    applicable.

 8. The judge concluded that the Appellant qualified as a  "worker".   This
    was because although there were cases, such as SS Works and Pensions  v
    Dias [2009] EWCA Civ 807, which involved a citizen of Portugal, who had
    given up her work, when she became pregnant, in order to take maternity
    leave and then  to  receive  income  support,  which  resulted  in  her
    disqualifying herself from the status  of  a  "worker",  this  was  not
    applicable in a case such as the present, where the Appellant had given
    up work in order to care for an adult, and was  receiving,  not  income
    support, but a carer's allowance.  The judge resolved that the  instant
    case was different because in that case a voluntary  decision  to  care
    for her child instead of working had been made  by  the  applicant  and
    accordingly she had not retained her worker  status  for  the  relevant
    period.  As the judge explained, that in the instant  case,  where  the
    Appellant was looking after his wife, as  an  adult,  "the  alternative
    would I presume be that the DWP would need to pay for a carer to attend
    upon the Appellant's wife in his absence.  If for  example  that  carer
    employed by the DWP was an EEA citizen, then that citizen would qualify
    as a worker" (paragraph 34).

 9. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

10. In the grounds of application, it is said that the judge erred  in  law
    when it was concluded that the Appellant was a worker for the  purposes
    of the Regulations by virtue of his role as a carer for  his  wife  for
    which he received carer's allowance from the DWP.

11. On 20th September 2017, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 8th December 2017, Mr Bates,  appearing  on
    behalf of  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State,  made  the  following
    submissions.  First, that the Department of Work and Pensions  was  not
    an employer  of  people.   Therefore  there  could  not  have  been  an
    employment relationship, however loosely constructed, between the DWP's
    payment of a  carer's  allowance,  and  the  Appellant  performing  the
    activities that he did for his wife.  All that the DWP  was  doing  was
    providing a benefit.  Just being in receipt of a carer's allowance  was
    therefore not enough.  Second, the judge had referred to the  fact  (at
    paragraph 25) that the carer's allowance requires a recipient to  "earn
    no more than �110 a week".  The reference to "must earn" suggested that
    the Appellant had to have at least a part-time job if he was  to  be  a
    worker.  It did not matter how much he earned provided that he did earn
    an amount that was less than �110 a week.  Not earning anything at  all
    did not qualify him as a worker if he  was  in  receipt  of  a  carer's
    allowance.  Third, whereas it is the case that  the  judge  refers  (at
    paragraph 26) to the fact that Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    states at paragraph  E-ECP3.3  that  being  in  receipt  of  a  carer's
    allowance does not require one to demonstrate an  income  threshold  of
    �18,600, this was a matter  with  respect  to  any  entirely  different
    immigration consideration, whereas the community law  requirements  are
    different.  The judge needed to demonstrate how what was  said  in  the
    Immigration Rules was a material factor to the  interpretation  of  the
    community law provisions here.  Fourth, the judge had referred  to  the
    case of Land Berlin [C-14/09] but it still needed  to  be  demonstrated
    what the relationship between the employer and the employee was in this
    case and the judge had not explained that.  It was not clear what types
    of services were being provided in this type of activity.  The DWP  was
    not an employer.  It was not viewing the Appellant as an employee.

13. Fifth, the judge introduced her artificial  distinction  (at  paragraph
    34) in stating that there was a difference between  voluntarily  giving
    up one's work, as the women did in a series  of  cases,  such  as  Dias
    [2009] EWCA Civ 807, in order to look after their children, and a  case
    such as the present where the Appellant was also giving up his work  in
    order to look after his adult wife.  Distinction was artificial because
    if the Appellant's wife needed caring, the local authority  could  move
    in and provide a level of services which could not be ruled  out  in  a
    case such as the present.  The judge had not explored that.

14. Finally, the Appellant here was a benefit recipient  who  was  entirely
    dependent upon public funds.  The EEA Regulations at  Section  39(3)(a)
    state that one must be a  person  who  "accepts  offers  of  employment
    actually made", and the Appellant was in no  position  to  be  able  to
    demonstrate this.  Although the judge had referred to the correct  case
    law (at paragraph 33) this particular aspect had been overlooked.

15. For her part, Ms Brankovic submitted that there was no  error  of  law.
    The judge had recognised that there was no binding authority and had to
    make a decision.  The judge carried out his own research.   He  focused
    on the issue correctly at the outset.   He  addressed  the  issue.   He
    noted how under ECP3.3 being in receipt of a carer's  allowance  is  an
    exemption whereby one does not have to demonstrate income  of  �18,600.
    (See paragraph 26).  The judge considered the case of Land  Berlin  [C-
    14/09] and noted how European Union law required  that  the  activities
    engaged in "are real and genuine" and this  was  the  case  here.   The
    judge considered whether the requirement of working  35  hours  a  week
    less than a national minimum wage of �7.50 changed  the  situation  and
    concluded that it did not.  The EEA Regulations  do  not  stipulate  at
    paragraph 3(a) that because there is no former offer of a job that this
    does not continue to make one a worker if one  is  rendering  real  and
    genuine services.  Finally, the distinction between being in receipt of
    "income support" in order to look after one's child and being  given  a
    "carer's allowance" in order to attend to one's wife was properly  made
    because in the case of the former, a  mother  who  was  in  receipt  of
    income support could still leave the child with somebody  else  and  go
    and work elsewhere, which was not the case with being in receipt  of  a
    "carer's allowance".

16. Ms Brankovic submitted that there was no error of law.



No Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons were as follows.  First, whereas it is  the  case
    that there is no binding authority that falls precisely on this  point,
    it is not the case that there is no guidance available.   Guidance  was
    given by the Upper Tribunal itself in the case of Begum (EEA - worker -
    jobseeker) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00275.  This confirmed that whether  an
    EEA national is a worker for the purposes of the EEA  Regulations  must
    be construed within the meaning of EU law.  It must not be  interpreted
    narrowly but broadly.  It is not conditioned by the type of  employment
    or the amount  of  income  derived.   A  person  who  does  not  pursue
    effective and genuine activities, or pursue activities on such a  small
    scale as to be regarded as purely marginal,  and  ancillary,  or  which
    have no economic value to an employer, is  not  a  worker.   The  judge
    referred to this decision at paragraph 31 of  the  determination.   The
    judge also referred to the case of Mohammed Barry [2008] EWCA Civ  1440
    which established that a person might be a worker even though he worked
    for less than the minimum wage.  This was also referred to by the judge
    at paragraph 31.

18.  Accordingly,  this  was  a  case  where  the  Appellant  was  pursuing
    activities "which are real and genuine to the exclusion  of  activities
    on such a small scale as to be purely marginal and ancillary".  He  was
    in receipt of a carer's allowance which is  expressly  accepted  as  an
    exemption under E-ECP.3.1 to the requirement  in  Appendix  FM  that  a
    person must be in receipt of the �18,600 income  threshold.   The  fact
    that domestic law has so stated is  not  an  irrelevant  consideration.
    Whereas there is a Rule that the community law provisions must  not  be
    interpreted  narrowly,  there  is  no  Rule  that  they  must  not   be
    interpreted broadly in the  domestic  context.   Finally  the  decision
    between a person who, takes income support, after voluntarily giving up
    a job, in order to provide parental care for  her  child,  is  a  valid
    distinction as against a person such as the Appellant who is in receipt
    of a carer's allowance from the DWP in order to care for his wife.  The
    judge was not wrong in stating that care would have to be  provided  in
    some form or another, and if the Appellant could not  provide  it  then
    payment would have to be made for  somebody  else  to  provide  such  a
    service.  The important thing was that this was a  "real  and  genuine"
    service and not ancillary to other activities.  There is,  accordingly,
    no error of law.



Notice of Decision

19. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

20. An anonymity direction is made.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
