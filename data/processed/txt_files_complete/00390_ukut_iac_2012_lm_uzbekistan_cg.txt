                             COUNTRY GUIDANCE


   (1) Article 223 of the Uzbekistan Criminal Code (UCC) makes it an offence
   for a citizen to leave the country without permission - what is described
   as "illegal exit abroad". The basic offence of "illegal exit  abroad"  is
   punishable by a fine or by imprisonment for between three to five  years.




   (2) In specified aggravating circumstances  (a  physical  breach  of  the
   border, conspiracy, or the exit abroad  of  a  state  employee  requiring
   special permission) the penalty for "illegal exit abroad"  under  Article
   223 of the UCC rises to five to ten years' imprisonment.  It  is  unclear
   from the evidence before us whether a fine will also be imposed.


   (3) Uzbek citizens are required to obtain an exit permit prior to leaving
   the country.  However, Annex 1  to  the  Resolution  of  the  Council  of
   Ministers No. 8, issued on 06.01.1995, provides that no  penalties  apply
   to someone who returns to Uzbekistan  after  the  expiry  of  their  exit
   permit. Normally, exit permits can be renewed at the  Uzbekistan  Embassy
   in the third country where an Uzbek citizen is living.


   (4) There are cases of Uzbek nationals, having left the country lawfully,
   nevertheless being charged with  "illegal  exit  abroad"  and  prosecuted
   under Article 223 following their return to Uzbekistan with expired  exit
   permits. However, those  cases  involved  pre-existing  interest  by  the
   authorities, association with the events in Andijan in 2005,  association
   with Islamic militant activity,  travel  to  countries  other  than  that
   authorised in the exit permit or other such distinguishing features.

   (5) There is no evidence of prosecutions under Article 223 of the UCC  of
   ordinary returning Uzbek citizens with expired  exit  permits,  including
   failed asylum seekers, where such individuals had no  particular  profile
   or distinguishing features which would otherwise have led to any  adverse
   interest in them.  It  has  therefore  not  been  established  that  such
   returnees are at real risk of persecution on return.

   (6) The ill-treatment of detainees is a pervasive and enduring problem in
   Uzbekistan, for which there is no concrete evidence  of  any  fundamental
   improvement in recent years (Ergashev v Russia [2009] ECtHR 12106/09 ECHR
   2249).  Therefore, where an Uzbek citizen is likely  to  be  detained  on
   return, Article 3 ECHR will be engaged.

   (7) The country guidance given by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  in
   OM (Returning citizens, minorities, religion) Uzbekistan CG [2007]  UKAIT
   00045 is re-affirmed.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This was an appeal against the determination of an  Immigration  Judge
      who dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision
      of 30 June 2009 to remove her to Uzbekistan, following a decision that
      she was not entitled  to  asylum,  humanitarian  protection  or  human
      rights protection in the United Kingdom.

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Uzbekistan, now almost 34 years old. She
      left Uzbekistan in July 2008 to study in the United Kingdom,  and  her
      daughter  was  born  here  in  March  2009,  seven  months  after  the
      appellant's arrival.  Her daughter, now  age  3,  is  the  appellant's
      dependant in this appeal.

   3. When her student visa expired, the appellant sought further  leave  to
      remain through a third party; her passport was returned to her by that
      third party, endorsed with a further  'residence  permit',  which  she
      claims to have believed to be genuine and valid, but which  she  later
      discovered was false.   Whilst it is now accepted that the appellant's
      passport is a genuine document,  and  the  Uzbek  exit  visa  endorsed
      therein was validly obtained, the leave to remain is a forgery.

   4. The appellant claimed asylum in June 2009, when her daughter was three
      months old, claiming to fear that her husband  would  take  the  child
      from her on her return to Uzbekistan, as  he  was  unhappy  about  her
      relationship with another  man.  The  respondent  refused  the  asylum
      application promptly and made removal directions to Uzbekistan.    The
      appellant appealed:  at the hearing, she raised for the first time the
      expiry of her exit visa and her status as a lone mother  returning  to
      Uzbekistan.  The immigration judge dismissed  the  appeal  in  October
      2009.

   5. The appellant  challenged  that  dismissal,  and  reconsideration  was
      ordered by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) in February 2010,
      which took effect as a grant of permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal. In May 2010, the Upper Tribunal found an error  of  law  and
      set aside the determination (Appendix A).  The appeal  was  identified
      as suitable for country guidance on exit visas from Uzbekistan.  There
      was then a considerable delay during which the appeal was prepared for
      hearing as a country guidance determination,  and  appropriate  expert
      reports commissioned and served.  We regret the length of  the  delay.
      The information which we considered when the appeal  came  before  the
      Upper Tribunal in July 2012 was up to date at the date of the hearing.

The Asylum Claim

   6. The basis of the appellant's claim was  expanded  in  her  grounds  of
      appeal and in her witness statement for the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing.
      There were three possible elements to  the  asylum  claim  as  it  was
      presented, of which only one was relied upon:

   (a)      The  original  asylum  claim,  based  upon  a  claimed  fear  of
   persecution by her husband because he was jealous of a  relationship  she
   had with an ex-boyfriend. The appellant had a child, born in  the  United
   Kingdom shortly after she arrived, and she claimed to fear that on return
   to Uzbekistan, her husband would take the baby away from her.  That  part
   of her claim was not accepted as credible by the judge and has  not  been
   pursued further.

   (b)      A sur place claim relating to the expiry, while  in  the  United
   Kingdom, of  the  valid  exit  visa  on  which  the  appellant  had  left
   Uzbekistan.  She argued that she  would  face  persecutory  treatment  on
   return because she had overstayed her permitted absence from her country.

   (c)       There  was  also  a  second  sur  place  claim,  based  on  the
   appellant's claimed  conversion  to  Christianity  while  in  the  United
   Kingdom,  and  her  alleged  involvement  with  the   Jehovah's   Witness
   community.  At the hearing, Mr Vokes for  the  appellant  confirmed  that
   this element of her claim was not pursued and that the only question  for
   the Tribunal was the risk arising from the expiry of her exit  visa,  and
   any adverse interest from the Uzbek authorities which that might attract.



   7. The judge relied on the country  guidance  given  by  the  Asylum  and
      Immigration  Tribunal in OM (Returning citizens, minorities, religion)
      Uzbekistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00045, concluding that  the  appellant  had
      failed to establish that the expiry of her exit permit would  put  her
      at risk on return to Uzbekistan. He noted that in OM it was held  that
      it had not been established that Uzbek citizens  whose  passports  had
      expired could not obtain a  renewal  from  embassies  abroad  or  that
      returnees who had been abroad for a longer period than permitted by an
      exit permit were  at  real  risk  of  disproportionate  punishment  on
      return.  OM was appealed to the Court of Appeal and  remitted  to  the
      AIT by consent order on 22 October  2008.   OM  was  the  only  extant
      country guidance on Uzbekistan available to the judge:   however,  the
      information on which it is based, and which is listed at  the  end  of
      the determination, is now over six  years  old,  the  latest  document
      dating back to September 2006.

   8. The grounds of appeal relied upon background information in an Amnesty
      International report of 28 April 2009, which  indicated  that  Article
      223 of the Uzbek Criminal Code punished illegal exit from and entry to
      the country, including return to the county after  the  expiry  of  an
      exit permit, arguing that the country guidance in OM was out  of  date
      and should not be followed. Permission to appeal was granted  relating
      to the arguable risk on return following the expiry of an exit  permit
      and the immigration judge was subsequently  found  to  have  erred  by
      failing to consider the evidence provided in the Amnesty International
      report as to new regulations preventing Uzbek nationals from  renewing
      their exit visas abroad.

Country Guidance Issue

   9. The case was identified for country guidance following the decision of
      the Court of Appeal in LS (Uzbekistan) v Secretary of  State  for  the
      Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 909 to remit that case  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal  as  a  result  of  subsequent  expert  evidence  from   Miss
      Farquharson; the uncertainty as to the status of the country  guidance
      in OM following its remittal by the Court of Appeal to  the  Tribunal;
      and in the light of additional evidence of ill-treatment of  returnees
      by the Uzbek  authorities.  Directions  following  the  error  of  law
      hearing identified a country guidance issue  as  'the  risk  to  Uzbek
      citizens returning to Uzbekistan after illegal exit', but the facts of
      this appeal do not raise that question and the argument before us  was
      confined to the risk arising from an expired exit visa.

  10. The experts were asked to assist the Upper Tribunal in  assessing  the
      risk for persons whose exit visas had expired, on return to Uzbekistan
      (a Muslim country) in the following three situations:

     a) Failed asylum seekers;
     b) Persons charged and detained for exit visa offences under the Uzbek
        Criminal Code; and
     c) Women with children born in the United Kingdom outside wedlock.


  11. At a directions hearing on 20 February 2012, Mr Vokes advised that the
      risk factor of returning to a Muslim country with a child born out  of
      wedlock was no longer pursued.

Evidence Considered

  12. We have before us various documents and country materials and reports.
      We  also  received  country  expert  evidence   from   Miss   Marjorie
      Farquharson and Mr Robert Chenciner, both for the  appellant,  and  we
      had  available  to  us  an  extensive  report  from  Asylum   Research
      Consultancy (ARC). The expert evidence is summarised, and the relevant
      materials set  out,  in  the  Appendices  to  this  determination,  as
      follows:

Appendix A  Error of Law Decision

Appendix B  Documents before the Upper Tribunal

Appendix C  Evidence of Marjorie Farquharson

Appendix D  Evidence of Robert Chenciner

Appendix E  Evidence of Asylum Research Consultancy

Appendix F  Background Information

  13. We have taken into account all of the materials before  us  and  shall
      refer to the appropriate parts  of  it  in  this  determination.   The
      following is a summary of the most important  areas  of  the  evidence
      before us. More detailed summaries appear in the Appendices.

Exit and Entry Procedures for Uzbekistan

  14. The exit and entry procedures in Uzbekistan are set out in some detail
      in the background materials and in particular in the reports from Miss
      Farquharson and from  the  Asylum  Research  Consultancy  and  can  be
      summarised as follows. Further details are provided in the summary  of
      the individual reports.

  15. The rights of Uzbek citizens to leave the country are governed by  the
      "Exit Procedure for Citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan". According
      to these procedures,  in  order  to  obtain  a  temporary  exit  visa,
      citizens of Uzbekistan  must  apply  to  the  Department  of  Internal
      Affairs in  their  home  area,  completing  an  application  form  and
      producing their passport. If  granted,  an  exit  visa  is  valid  for
      temporary exit for a period of two years and allows the holder  to  go
      abroad any number of  times  within  the  prescribed  two-year  period
      without re-applying.

  16. According to current practice in Uzbekistan, once the  application  is
      received, the Department of Internal Affairs returns the  individual's
      passport, normally within 15 days,  authorising  the  travel,  and  in
      addition to the internal stamp on the passport, a sticker is placed on
      the back of it. Citizens who do not have a passport  are  entitled  to
      receive a passport and sticker from their local Department of Internal
      Affairs, also within a period of 15 days. Throughout the two years  of
      their authorised travel, Uzbek bearers of such  passports  may  freely
      leave and enter Uzbekistan.

The Uzbek Criminal Code

  17. Illegal exit abroad or illegal entry into Uzbekistan is  regulated  by
      Article 223 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, which is found in  Part  2  of
      the Code, at Chapter 17, entitled 'Crimes  against  Public  Security'.
      The basic penalty is 50-100 times the minimum monthly  wage  (so  just
      over 4-8 years' wages) or  3-5  years'  imprisonment.   In  aggravated
      circumstances set out in Article 223, the period of imprisonment rises
      to 5-10 years. As set out in the Uzbek Constitution, Article 223  does
      not apply to 'foreigners and  stateless  persons'  who  are  political
      asylum seekers and entered Uzbekistan without proper entry  documents.



  18. Article 223 states as follows:

         "Illegal Exit Across the Border or Illegal Entry into the  Republic
   of Uzbekistan.


      Exit across the border, or entry into the Republic of  Uzbekistan,  or
      crossing of the border in violation of established procedure -


      Is punishable by a fine of between 50 and 100 minimum monthly wage, or
      deprivation of freedom from three to five years.


      The same actions committed:

     a) by means of a physical breach;
     b) by preliminary agreement with a group;
     c) by a state employee whose exit abroad requires a special  agreement
        -


      are punishable by deprivation of  liberty  of  between  five  and  ten
      years.


      Foreigners  and  stateless  people,  who  are  in  Uzbekistan  without
      properly constituted entry documents, for the  purpose  of  exercising
      the right  to  political  asylum,  foreseen  by  the  Constitution  of
      Uzbekistan, are exempt from criminal responsibility."

  19. For the appellant, Mr Vokes also sought to rely on  Articles  139  and
      140 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, in Chapter 6 of Part I  of  the  Code,
      entitled 'Crimes against Family, the Youth, and Morality':

    "Article 139. Denigration

    Denigration, that is, dissemination of  false,  defamatory  information
    committed after a previous administrative penalty for the same action -
    shall be punished with fine  up  to  fifty  minimal  monthly  wages  or
    correctional labor up to two years.

    Denigration through a printed or otherwise copied text or through  mass
    media - shall be punished with fine from fifty to one  hundred  minimal
    monthly wages or correctional labor from two to three years, or  arrest
    up to six months, or imprisonment up to six years.

    Denigration:

    a) aggravated by commission of a serious or especially serious crime;
    b) that resulted in grave consequences;
    c) committed by a special dangerous recidivist;
    d) from mercenary or other foul motives -

    shall be punished with imprisonment up to three years.


    Article 140. Insult


    Insult, that is, intentional grievous degrading of honor and dignity of
    a person committed after a previous administrative penalty for the same
    actions - shall be punished with fine up to fifty minimal monthly wages
    or correctional labor up to one year.

    Insult through a printed or otherwise copied text or through mass media
    - shall be punished with fine from fifty to one hundred minimal monthly
    wages or correctional labor from one to two years.

    Insult:


    a) in connection with performing by a victim his professional or  civil
    duty;
    b) by a dangerous recidivist or  a  person  previously  prosecuted  for
    denigration -


    shall be punished with fine from  one  hundred  to  one  hundred  fifty
    minimal monthly wages or correctional labor from two to three years, or
    by arrest up to six months."

  20. We return to  the  consideration  of  these  Articles  later  in  this
      determination.

The Andijan massacres

  21. The materials before us refer to the aftermath of what have come to be
      known as the 'Andijan massacres', on Friday 13 May  2005,  when  anti-
      government gunmen in the eastern city of Andijan forcibly released  23
      people charged with Islamic extremism.  Later that day,  thousands  of
      unarmed people gathered in  the  main  square  to  protest  peacefully
      against the government of President Karimov.  Troops  opened  fire  on
      the protesters, and the international press reported a bloodbath  with
      several hundred civilian deaths. The  Uzbek  authorities  stated  that
      fewer than 190 died.

  22. Oppositionists blamed the authorities' brutal determination  to  crush
      all dissent.  President  Karimov  blamed  fundamentalists  seeking  to
      overthrow the government and establish a Muslim caliphate  in  Central
      Asia.

Country evidence

  23. There is no UKBA Country of Origin Report or Operational Guidance Note
      in relation to Uzbekistan.

US Department of State

  24. The 2011 US State Department Report on Human  Rights  for  Uzbekistan,
      dated 24 May 2012, noted at Section 2d that:

    "Foreign Travel: Citizens are required to have a domicile  registration
    stamp in their passport before travelling domestically or  leaving  the
    country. The government also requires  citizens  and  foreign  citizens
    permanently residing in the country to obtain exit  visas  for  foreign
    travel or emigration, although it generally grants the visas.  In  July
    the Cabinet of Ministers adopted amendments  to  exit  visa  procedures
    that  allowed  denial  to  travel  on   the   basis   of   "information
    demonstrating the inexpedience  of  the  travel."  According  to  civil
    society activists,  these  provisions  were  poorly  defined  and  such
    decisions could not be appealed. In addition, ostensibly in  an  effort
    to combat trafficking in persons, the  country  introduced  regulations
    that required male relatives  of  women  age  18  to  35  to  submit  a
    statement  pledging  that  the  women  would  not  engage  in   illegal
    behaviour, including prostitution, while abroad.

    As in past years, although the law prescribes that a decision should be
    reached within 15 days, there were reports that the government  delayed
    exit visas for human rights activists and  independent  journalists  to
    prevent their travel abroad. For example, during the  year  authorities
    subjected  human  rights  activists  Dmitriy  Tikhonov   and   Vladimir
    Khusainov, and independent journalist Abdumalik Boboev to such  delays,
    although Tikhonov and Boboev eventually received visas after waiting 10
    and four months, respectively. In  August  the  government  refused  to
    issue an exit visa to human rights activist Tatiana  Dovlatova,  citing
    her January conviction on hooliganism charges.

    Citizens generally continued  to  be  able  to  travel  to  neighboring
    states. Land travel to Afghanistan remained difficult. Citizens  needed
    permission from the  NSS  [National  Security  Service]  to  cross  the
    border.

    The government requires hotels to register foreign  visitors  with  the
    government on a daily basis. Foreigners who stay in private  homes  are
    required to register their  location  within  three  days  of  arrival.
    Government officials closely monitor foreigners in  border  areas,  but
    foreigners generally can move within the country without restriction.

    Emigration  and  Repatriation:  The  law  does  not  provide  for  dual
    citizenship. In theory, returning citizens must  prove  to  authorities
    that they did not acquire foreign citizenship while abroad or face loss
    of citizenship. In practice citizens  who  possessed  dual  citizenship
    generally travelled without impediment.

    The government noted that citizens residing  outside  the  country  for
    more than six months could register with the country's Consulates,  and
    such registration was voluntary. Unlike in some previous  years,  there
    were no reports that failure to  register  rendered  citizens  residing
    abroad and children born abroad stateless."

  25. The Executive Summary to the 2011  Report  supported  the  appellant's
      claim that if she were to be detained,  conditions  in  detention  and
      prison were harsh and on occasion life-threatening.

    "Uzbekistan is an authoritarian state with a constitution that provides
    for  a  presidential  system  with  separation  of  powers  among   the
    executive, legislative, and judicial branches.  In  practice  President
    Islam Karimov and the centralized executive branch dominated  political
    life and exercised nearly complete control over the other  branches  of
    government. ...

    The most significant  human  rights  problems  included:  instances  of
    torture and abuse of  detainees  by  security  forces;  denial  of  due
    process  and  fair  trial;  and  restrictions  on  religious   freedom,
    including harassment  and  imprisonment  of  religious  minority  group
    members.

    Other continuing human  rights  problems  included:  incommunicado  and
    prolonged  detention;  harsh  and  sometimes  life-threatening   prison
    conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention (although officials released
    four high-profile prisoners detained for apparently political reasons);
    restrictions on freedom of speech, press,  assembly,  and  association;
    governmental restrictions on civil society  activity;  restrictions  on
    freedom of movement; violence against women;  and  government-organized
    forced labor in cotton harvesting. Authorities subjected  human  rights
    activists, journalists, and others who  criticized  the  government  to
    harassment, arbitrary arrest, and politically motivated prosecution and
    detention.

    Government officials  frequently  engaged  in  corrupt  practices  with
    impunity."

Amnesty International

  26. The Amnesty International submission to the UN Human Rights  Committee
      on 28 April 2009 raised issues for consideration  in  the  Committee's
      third  review  of  measures  taken  by  Uzbekistan  to  implement  the
      International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights.    Amnesty
      International's position may be summarised in  the  following  excerpt
      from the Introduction to that submission:

    "Since  ...  March  2005,  the  authorities  have  introduced   further
    legislative and judicial reforms aimed at bringing national legislation
    into line with international standards. Uzbekistan abolished the  death
    penalty in January 2008 and ratified the Second  Optional  Protocol  to
    the ICCPR in December  2008.  Judicial  supervision  of  detention  was
    introduced in 2008 and several imprisoned human rights  defenders  were
    released conditionally during  the  year.  The  authorities  have  also
    continued with numerous, wide-ranging and officially endorsed, national
    initiatives in the fields of human rights education and reform, such as
    adopting the National Action Plan on torture in  2004.  The  government
    has also increased dialogue on  human  rights  with  the  international
    community,  in  particular  the  European  Union,  following  sanctions
    imposed by the EU in November 2005.

    Amnesty International regrets, however, that all the above developments
    have failed to lead to necessary, genuine  and  wide-reaching  systemic
    reforms. The organization remains seriously concerned  at  ongoing  and
    persistent human rights violations in Uzbekistan and at the failure  of
    the authorities to fully and effectively implement  the  state  party's
    obligations under the ICCPR and the recommendations by the Human Rights
    Committee, as well as other UN treaty bodies  and  special  procedures.
    ... in spite of the reforms mentioned above, there has been  a  serious
    deterioration in the human rights situation especially since, and as  a
    consequence of, the so-called Andizhan events in May 2005. Hundreds  of
    individuals, including women and children, were  killed  when  security
    forces opened fire on mostly  unarmed  demonstrators  gathered  in  the
    centre of Andizhan, and as they fled. In the aftermath  of  the  events
    the government severely clamped down on expression and manifestation of
    dissent and tried to suppress independent reporting  on  the  killings.
    Hundreds of demonstrators were detained and reportedly ill-treated  and
    witnesses were intimidated. Journalists and human rights defenders were
    harassed, beaten and detained; some were prisoners of  conscience  held
    on serious criminal charges. Following unfair trials, the  majority  of
    which were closed or secret,  hundreds  of  people  were  convicted  of
    "terrorism" offences and were sentenced to long prison terms for  their
    alleged participation in the unrest. The authorities in Uzbekistan have
    actively sought the extradition of  members  or  suspected  members  of
    banned Islamist parties or Islamic movements, which it blames  for  the
    Andizhan events.

    Amnesty International is dismayed in  particular  at  the  authorities'
    continued refusal to allow an independent, international  investigation
    into  the  killings  in  Andizhan  in  2005.  ...Amnesty  International
    believes that at the roots of the concerns highlighted in this briefing
    lie a deep-seated culture of impunity for human rights violations and a
    failure by the  Uzbekistani  authorities  to  fully  guarantee  genuine
    freedom of expression and association as stipulated by the ICCPR. "

  27.  As  regards  civil  rights  generally,  the   Amnesty   International
      submission is in line with the US State  Department  Report  evidence;
      the Uzbek authorities had refused access  for  verification  of  their
      claims that torture  in  custody  was  decreasing,  or  to  permit  an
      international investigation of the Andijan massacre.  The report cited
      one instance (in 2007) where a male overstayer had been prosecuted  on
      return and imprisoned for overstaying his exit visa.   No  details  of
      his political profile or other circumstances were given; he  had  been
      released subsequently in the context of an amnesty but remained  under
      a form of house arrest.

Asylum Research Consultancy (ARC) Report

  28. The ARC report is a collection  of  quotations  and  conclusions  from
      various sources and is not an expert source itself. The  report  cites
      cases of Uzbek citizens returning  to  Uzbekistan  with  expired  exit
      permits being charged under Article 223 of the  Criminal  Code,  based
      upon information from various sources. Reference is made to  a  report
      of February 2010 from the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights in which
      it is stated that they were  aware  of  two  such  cases  and  limited
      details are provided at page 20. The first involved a student who  had
      graduated from a European university, whose exit  permit  had  expired
      before the end of the academic term but who had been  assured  by  the
      Uzbekistan Embassy that she  could  extend  her  exit  visa  once  she
      returned  to  Uzbekistan,  who  was  then  prosecuted  on  return   to
      Uzbekistan. In that case, the student had travelled to a third country
      on her way home and was as a result accused of having travelled abroad
      illegally. The second case involved an Uzbek citizen who  had  married
      an American citizen and had lived in the US with him  for  some  time,
      and who was prosecuted for violating the terms of her exit  visa  when
      she returned to Uzbekistan to process the paperwork  to  give  up  her
      citizenship. Both women were  amnestied  in  the  end,  although  they
      retained marks in their permanent records.

  29. The ARC report refers also to a case cited in the Human  Rights  Watch
      report of 3 May 2010 of an Uzbek woman who in 2005 fled to Kyrgyzstan,
      later resettled in Australia and who returned to Uzbekistan in January
      2010 after being  assured  that  she  could  return  without  fear  of
      reprisal or punishment. She was charged with illegal  border  crossing
      and anti-constitutional activity and was sentenced to  ten  years  and
      two months in prison. Another case cited in the  ARC  report  is  also
      documented in an Amnesty International report of May 2011 and in  both
      cases there were associations with the events in  Andijan.  The  final
      example given in the ARC report  is  from  the  Amnesty  International
      report of May 2010 and cites the same case as in  the  28  April  2009
      Amnesty International report.

FCO Evidence

  30. In response to requests from the  respondent,  the  FCO  provided  two
      letters which were  broadly  in  line  with  the  information  already
      summarised about illegal exit  and  concerning  the  circumstances  in
      which an exit  visa  is  obtained.  In  relation  to  staying  outside
      Uzbekistan after travelling, the FCO position is as follows:

    (1)    FCO letter from British Embassy  Tashkent  to  Country  Specific
    Policy Team, Home Office, dated 14 December 2009

    This letter is a response to questions raised by the UKBA in  an  email
    to the FCO dated 27 November 2009, in which the  author  confirms  that
    they have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the responses  which  were
    provided by a Tashkent law firm. The letter confirms that the exit visa
    system  is  universally  enforced,  pursuant  to  "Exit  Procedure  for
    Citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan" approved  as  Annex  1  to  the
    Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan
    issued on 06.01.1995 No.8, according to which a visa is  used  for  two
    years. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic  of  Uzbekistan
    has overall responsibility for the maintenance of the passport  regime,
    including keeping records of all exit visas issued. Exit visas must  be
    valid and available for checking at the  airport.  Exit  visas  can  be
    renewed at the Uzbekistan Embassy  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  Uzbek
    passports can be replaced if lost or damaged, or renewed if expired  at
    the Uzbekistan Embassy in the United Kingdom.

    An exit from or an entry to Uzbekistan will be considered illegal if an
    individual does not possess any valid authorisation (visa) to enter  or
    to leave Uzbekistan issued either by the Ministry of  Internal  Affairs
    or by a respective Uzbekistan Consulate abroad. Expiry of an exit  visa
    upon return of an Uzbek citizen to Uzbekistan will  not  be  considered
    illegal as an exit visa is issued to confirm the right  to  exit  only.
    Expiry of an exit visa before any travel  or  while  travelling  abroad
    does  not  constitute  an  administrative  or  a  criminal  breach.  No
    penalties are applicable for returning to Uzbekistan if the  exit  visa
    has expired, as exit visas are issued to confirm the right of an  Uzbek
    citizen to exit the Republic of Uzbekistan within a specified period. A
    returnee holding an expired exit visa must produce evidence that he/she
    had a  valid  exit  visa  at  the  time  of  leaving  the  Republic  of
    Uzbekistan, in which case no penalties are applicable.

    (2)    FCO letter from British Embassy  Tashkent  to  Country  Specific
    Policy team, Home Office, dated 14 December 2010

    "...Uzbekistan laws do not require individuals to have a "permission to
    travel abroad". Uzbekistan laws require individuals intending to  leave
    the territory of Uzbekistan  to  acquire  a  permission  to  leave  the
    territory of Uzbekistan. This kind of permission is  given  for  a  two
    year period and is applied  only  with  respect  to  the  right  of  an
    individual to leave Uzbekistan. Once an individual has left  Uzbekistan
    he/she is free to stay abroad for any  period  desired  (provided  that
    other passport regime regulations are satisfied). If an individual  has
    left Uzbekistan within  the  period  of  validity  of  the  permission,
    Article 223 will not apply. If an individual  left  Uzbekistan  without
    permission it is most likely that he/she would  face  criminal  charges
    upon his return to Uzbekistan under Article 223. Uzbek nationals do not
    require any permission to enter Uzbekistan. ..."

  31. The evidence is based upon the advice of a Tashkent law firm.

Other international evidence as to the procedure for obtaining an exit visa

  32.       Whilst we  have  given  consideration  to  all  the  documentary
      evidence listed at Appendix B, only the following additional documents
      are relevant.  The remaining materials listed in Appendix B relate  to
      matters no longer in issue before us.

      (a)   UNHCR RefWorld report 21 November 1996: Regulations on Entry  to
   and Exit From  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  Foreign  Citizens  and
   Stateless  Persons  which  provides  details  about   the   process   for
   applications to travel abroad, but adds  nothing  further  to  the  other
   reports summarised.

      (b)   Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights  report,  submitted  to  the
   98th session of the Committee  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights  (CCPR),
   informs the Committee about the Uzbek government's adherence to  statutes
   regarding freedom  of  movement  and  choice  of  residence.  The  report
   explains the system of "propiska" in Uzbekistan, which allows  the  state
   to register citizens at their places  of  residence  and  controls  their
   movements within the state. It also explains  the  requirements  for  the
   acquisition of exit permits for citizens wishing to  travel  abroad.  The
   report refers to several categories of citizens  who  are  restricted  in
   their rights to travel abroad for various reasons.

   (c)      Australian Government Refugee Review  Tribunal:  Country  Advice
   Uzbekistan 15 July 2010 provides  information  on  the  exit  procedures,
   including security checks,  in  Uzbekistan,  explaining  that  successful
   applicants receive a stamp  in  their  passport,  valid  for  two  years,
   authorising travel abroad.

  33. These reports are summarised in more detail in Appendix F.

Relevant Case Law
OM (Returning citizens, minorities, religion)  Uzbekistan  CG  [2007]  UKAIT
00045

  34. The appellant in OM was a citizen  of  Uzbekistan  who  had  left  the
      country in March 1996 with a valid exit visa to enable her to study in
      the United Kingdom (for which she had entry  clearance);  she  claimed
      asylum in July 1996.

  35.  Mr Craig Murray, a former employee of the  Foreign  and  Commonwealth
      Office and a former British  Ambassador  to  Uzbekistan,  gave  expert
      evidence that someone like the appellant, who  had  been  out  of  the
      country  for  just  over  10�  years,  without  valid  reason,   would
      inevitably  be  the  subject  of  grave  suspicion.   Her  arrival  in
      Uzbekistan would be noted and she would be suspected because  she  had
      not kept in contact with the Uzbekistan Embassy while in London.   His
      opinion was that remaining outside Uzbekistan illegally was a criminal
      offence and that it would be considered as showing that the  appellant
      was not a good patriot.

  36. The  reviewing  Tribunal,  however,  placed  limited  weight  upon  Mr
      Murray's evidence and, in dismissing the appeal, concluded that:
    "It has not been established that Uzbek citizens whose passports expire
    cannot obtain a renewal from Embassies abroad, or  that  returnees  who
    have been abroad for longer than permitted by an exit visa, are at real
    risk of disproportionate punishment on return.
    There is no satisfactory evidence that non-Uzbeks face discrimination
    of such a nature as to amount to persecution, or serious harm, or a
    breach of their article 3 rights."

37. The case was remitted to the AIT by the Court of Appeal with  a  consent
   order dated 22 October 2008.  The agreed  Statement  of  Reasons  on  the
   remittal made no comment of any kind  on  the  country  guidance  related
   aspects of the case. The Secretary  of  State  subsequently  granted  the
   appellant indefinite leave to remain.   OM still  appears  on  the  Upper
   Tribunal's list of country guidance determinations, albeit the underlying
   information is now six years out of date.
LS (Uzbekistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA
Civ 909

  38. The Court of Appeal considered the appeal of LS in July  2008,  before
      the remittal of OM to the AIT in October 2008.  The  appellant  in  LS
      was a  22-year  old  stewardess  with  the  state  airline  Uzbekistan
      Airways, who failed  to  rejoin  her  plane  to  return  to  Tashkent,
      claiming asylum on grounds of her sexuality.  She also claimed to have
      lost her passport.   The Court of  Appeal  distinguished  the  factual
      matrix in LS from that in OM on the basis there were some  potentially
      important differences.

  39. In particular, as a state employee with  the  national  airline,  LS's
      case appears to have fallen within Article 223 (c), in that she was  a
      'a state employee whose exit abroad requires a special agreement'  and
      there was no indication that she  had  permission  to  travel  abroad,
      otherwise than for the very limited purposes of  her  employment  with
      the airline. The appeal was remitted to the AIT for  consideration  of
      whether the appellant was at real risk of being charged on her  return
      to Uzbekistan with an Article  223  (c)  offence,  carrying  a  prison
      sentence of between 5 and 10 years. The judgment does not specifically
      refer to Article 223(c), but that can be inferred from the context.
Ergashev v Russia - 12106/09 [2011] ECHR 2249

  40. The applicant in Ergashev was appealing against an  extradition  order
      from Russia to Uzbekistan, alleging that he  risked  ill-treatment  in
      Uzbekistan. The European Court  of  Human  Rights  (ECtHR)  considered
      allegations that detainees  suffered  ill-treatment  in  Uzbekistan  ,
      finding that the  ill-treatment  of  detainees  in  Uzbekistan  was  a
      pervasive and enduring problem. The Court concluded on that basis that
      the applicant's forcible return to Uzbekistan would  give  rise  to  a
      violation of Article 3 of the ECHR.

NM and MM v United Kingdom - 39128/09 [2011] ECHR 320

  41. The ECtHR promulgated its decision in NM and MM on  25  January  2011.
      The applicants relied on a risk of ill-treatment  in  Uzbekistan  both
      because their exit visas had expired  and  because  they  had  claimed
      asylum in the United Kingdom. All other elements  of  their  arguments
      before the United Kingdom courts were no longer relied upon.

  42. The applicants in this case did not allege that the Uzbek  authorities
      had any pre-existing interest in them.  The Court cited with  approval
      the decision in OM, noting that:

   "30.  Country guidance determinations of both the former AIT and IAT are
   to be treated as an authoritative finding on the country  guidance  issue
   identified in the determination,  based  upon  the  evidence  before  the
   members of the Tribunal that  determined  the  appeal.  Unless  expressly
   superseded or replaced by a later country guidance determination, country
   guidance determinations are authoritative in any  subsequent  appeals  so
   far as that appeal relates to the country guidance issue in question  and
   depends upon the same or similar evidence."

  43. The Court was particularly interested in the AIT's assessment  of  the
      evidence of Mr Murray in OM.  Assessing the appellants'  appeals,  the
      Court said that:

    "63.  However, the Court observes that,  with  the  exception  of  the
    letter from Mr  Murray,  all  of  the  other  evidence  available  that
    describes the detention, torture and ill-treatment of forcibly returned
    Uzbek refugees and asylum seekers relates  to  cases  where  the  Uzbek
    authorities had a pre-existing interest  in  the  individual  concerned
    either because they were returned pursuant to an extradition request or
    because they were believed to be connected to the events at Andijan  in
    May 2005.

    64.  As regards the weight to be attached to Mr Murray's evidence, the
    Court notes that it was carefully considered by the AIT in the  country
    guidance case of OM, set  out  above  at  paragraphs  30  -  34.  After
    detailed examination, the AIT viewed Mr  Murray's  evidence  with  some
    circumspection given that he had interests of his own  which  affected,
    consciously or otherwise,  his  interpretation  of  facts  and  events.
    Furthermore, the  AIT  found  that  other  evidence,  relating  to  the
    appellant in OM, detracted very considerably  from  his  evidence.  The
    Court considers that there is no new evidence  before  it  which  would
    require it to reach a different conclusion and therefore considers that
    the Government were entitled to take the view that Mr Murray's evidence
    was not wholly accurate.

    65.  In the present case, the Court notes that the applicants  do  not
    allege that the Uzbek authorities have  any  pre-existing  interest  in
    them whatsoever, nor do they allege that they have ever  been  arrested
    in the past, or that they have any connection to the events at Andijan.
    They claim solely that they would be  at  risk  as  returnees  who  had
    claimed asylum abroad given the generally poor human rights  record  of
    Uzbekistan.

    66.  Having regard to all of the above, and the  fact  that  the  mere
    possibility of ill-treatment on account of an  unsettled  situation  in
    Uzbekistan would not in itself give rise to a breach of Article 3,  the
    Court concludes that the applicants  have  failed  to  adduce  evidence
    capable of establishing substantial grounds  for  believing  that  they
    would be exposed to  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
    contrary to Article 3 upon return solely on the basis of  their  status
    as failed asylum seekers without any further distinguishing features to
    bring them to the attention of the Uzbek authorities.

    67.  Second, in considering whether or not  the  applicants  would  be
    arrested upon return by the Uzbek authorities  due  to  the  expiry  of
    their exit  visas,  the  Court  notes  that  the  domestic  authorities
    concluded that it had not been established that returnees who had  been
    abroad for longer than permitted by an exit visa were at real  risk  of
    punishment on return (see in particular the findings of OM, as set  out
    above at paragraphs 30 - 34). The Court considers that there is nothing
    in either the applicant's submissions or the objective information  (as
    set out above at paragraphs 35 - 41) before it to cause it to come to a
    different view or to suggest that the applicants would be  arrested  or
    detained upon return such as to put them at risk of  being  exposed  to
    interrogation or treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention."

  44. The Court had regard to the concerns  of  Amnesty  International  that
      illegal exit abroad, including by  overstaying  permission  to  travel
      abroad, was punishable under Article 223 of  the  Criminal  Code,  but
      considered that there would be no such risk for the applicants who had
      not alleged that they had left Uzbekistan without  valid  exit  visas,
      but only that their exit visas had expired.

  45. In so concluding, the Court relied upon the FCO letters  (also  before
      us)  summarising  information  obtained  by  the  British  Embassy  in
      Tashkent  from  'a  Tashkent  law  firm',  stating  that   overstaying
      permission to travel abroad was not punishable under Article 223.  The
      Court rejected the applicants' complaints under Article 3 and declared
      the applications inadmissible.

The Appellant's Evidence

  46. The only evidence before us from the appellant consisted of that given
      before the First-tier Tribunal and a short written statement, none  of
      which related to the issues now before us. She did not give  any  oral
      evidence before us and in fact chose  to  leave  the  hearing  at  the
      commencement of the proceedings prior to the evidence of  the  experts
      and the submissions. Her evidence is not in dispute: she came  to  the
      United Kingdom as a student, on a valid exit visa, had a baby here and
      has not sought to renew her visa at the Uzbekistan Consulate.  She has
      a valid passport with one forged stamp in it.

The Expert Evidence

Ms Marjorie Farquharson

  47. Miss Farquharson has worked for thirty years in  the  field  of  human
      rights and the USSR and post-Soviet  states,  including  for  fourteen
      years as Amnesty  International's  researcher  on  the  USSR,  as  the
      Director of an EU project to develop  civil  society  in  the  Russian
      Federation and for six years as the administrator of  the  Council  of
      Europe's human rights programme in the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
      From 2001 she has been an independent researcher and  consultant,  and
      from 2009, carried out a gap analysis of statelessness in Central Asia
      for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in  preparation
      for their naturalisation drive later in 2010, which included  a  study
      of legislation on exit, entry and stay in Uzbekistan.

  48. She has contributed expert opinions in several asylum  cases  and,  in
      the light of her expert evidence before the Court of Appeal in LS,  as
      regards the penalties for illegal exit abroad under Article 223 of the
      Uzbekistan Criminal Code, the appellant's  appeal  in  that  case  was
      allowed and remitted to the Tribunal.

  49. Miss Farquharson, in her first report of  12  May  2010,  referred  to
      several cases of Uzbek citizens, particularly Uzbeks studying  abroad,
      who had been subjected to the tightening of the regulations on  travel
      abroad in 2006, following the Andijan massacres and who faced  charges
      of illegal exit abroad under Article 223 of  the  Uzbekistan  Criminal
      Code. She relied upon two  particular  sources  for  her  information,
      namely the Director of the Ecole des Etudes de  Sciences  Sociales  in
      Paris and the Le Mans-based "Association for Human Rights  in  Central
      Asia". The former reported that  since  2006  numerous  of  his  Uzbek
      students were unable to  complete  their  courses  because  they  were
      forbidden to  leave  the  country  under  threat  of  prosecution  for
      "illegal exit abroad". The latter reported that  students  and  labour
      migrants were now unable to renew their exit permits as previously  in
      their nearest Uzbekistan Consulate and were instead required to do  it
      in Uzbekistan at the local Department of Internal  Affairs  which  had
      given them their original documentation.

  50. Miss Farquharson referred to one  particular  case  of  an  Uzbek  law
      student studying in France, who was prosecuted in 2007  under  Article
      223 of the Criminal Code for failure to renew  an  exit  permit.   The
      student was tried, amnestied and put under house arrest in Uzbekistan.
      She concluded that  the  appellant,  having  no  record  of  political
      dissension or conflict with the Uzbek authorities, differed from those
      cases, since they were either associated with the events  in  Andijan,
      were  linked  to  Islamist  activity  and/or  had  featured   in   the
      international or specialist �migr� media.

  51. In her view, therefore, the question of risk  to  the  appellant  hung
      only on whether her exit visa was legal and the  consequences  of  her
      return to Uzbekistan as a failed asylum-seeker. At the time of writing
      the original report, Miss Farquharson had no access to the appellant's
      original passport, which was said to have been lost by the respondent.
       From the photocopy which was available, she was unable to form a view
      on the legality of the appellant's exit  permit  or  on  the  risk  of
      prosecution on return to Uzbekistan for  'illegal  exit  abroad'.  She
      considered that an application from the United Kingdom authorities  to
      the Uzbekistan Embassy to re-document the appellant because  they  had
      lost her passport, followed by her return to Uzbekistan  as  a  failed
      asylum-seeker, would draw negative  attention  to  the  appellant  and
      could make her liable to the same treatment as described in the  other
      cases to which she had referred.

  52. In her second report, the appellant's passport having been located and
      made available for Miss Farquharson to  examine,  she  considered  the
      passport to be authentic in format and concluded that the exit  permit
      at page 12 of the passport was authentic.  However,  Miss  Farquharson
      had concerns about the validity of some parts  of  the  document.  The
      propiska did not appear to have been issued by the Samarkand  Regional
      Department of Internal Affairs in Uzbekistan, the authority which  had
      registered the appellant's address and which had issued  the  passport
      and should, therefore, also have issued the propiska.    However,  she
      considered that any anomaly with the propiska could be resolved by the
      appellant formally registering her residence with her parents.

  53. Miss Farquharson now  considered  that,  since  the  appellant  had  a
      genuine exit permit authorising her to travel abroad and there was  no
      record of her having or being suspected of any  political  dissension,
      she would not be at risk of any of the reprisals faced  in  the  cases
      described in her previous report.

  54. Nor did Miss Farquharson consider that the appellant would be  charged
      with illegal exit abroad under Article 223 of the Criminal Code, since
      Annex 1 of the 1995 Resolution of the  Council  of  Ministers  of  the
      Republic of Uzbekistan 1995 No. 8 stated that no penalties applied  to
      someone returning to Uzbekistan after their exit permit  had  expired.
      The loss of the appellant's passport by the United Kingdom authorities
      would provide her with grounds to justify the delay  in  returning  to
      Uzbekistan after the expiry of her exit visa.

  55. In her oral evidence to us,  Miss  Farquharson  modified  her  opinion
      further. Having looked again  at  the  appellant's  passport,  she  no
      longer believed that the propiska was genuine.  Also,  she  considered
      that the expected exit sticker on the passport, similar to  those  she
      had seen during her recent research in Uzbekistan,  was  missing.  Her
      view now was that the entire passport was  not  genuine  and  in  oral
      evidence she stated  that  in  her  opinion,  the  appellant  probably
      possessed another identity document containing a genuine  propiska  in
      another document.  She still considered the exit permit to be genuine.



  56. In cross-examination Miss Farquharson stated that she  considered  the
      passport itself to be real but that not all the stamps  were  genuine.
      The fact that the appellant had not reported the loss of her  passport
      to the Uzbekistan Embassy on the two occasions when she believed  that
      it was lost could be a problem on her return, in particular if it  was
      a sign of having claimed asylum  and  of  UKBA  involvement.  Further,
      having a false document might, or might not, be counted  against  her.
      Miss Farquharson was unable to help us with  the current position  for
      those needing to renew  their  exit  permits  outside  Uzbekistan  and
      whether facilities  for  doing  so  were  once  again  available  from
      overseas Consulates.

Mr Robert Chenciner

  57. Mr Robert Chenciner has been a senior associate member of St  Antony's
      College Oxford since  1987,  specialising  initially  in  the  eastern
      Caucasus, and since 1991 an honorary member of the Russian Academy  of
      Sciences - Daghestan Scientific Centre. His knowledge extends  to  the
      Russian Federation, former Soviet countries,  and  in  particular  the
      Eastern Caucasus,  Georgia,  Chechnya,  Azerbaijan,  Crimea,  Ukraine,
      Belarus, Moldova, Armenia and other central Asian  countries.  He  has
      offered his expert opinion in many asylum appeals before the  Tribunal
      and was accepted as an expert in the previous country guidance case of
      OY (Chechen Muslim women) Russia CG [2009] UKAIT 00005.

  58. Mr Chenciner's written  report  related  for  the  most  part  to  the
      appellant's individual claim as  regards  her  fear  of  her  husband.
      However, insofar as his evidence related to the issues before  us,  he
      was of the opinion that the  appellant  would  be  at  risk  of  being
      charged with insulting the president, under Articles 139  and  140  of
      the Uzbekistan Criminal Code, as a result of having claimed asylum and
      that she would be identified as such on the basis of her  return  from
      the United Kingdom with a one-way ticket and an out-of-date  visa.  He
      referred to cases, not involving asylum claims, of a photo-reporter, a
      senior journalist and a poet who had been detained  in  Uzbekistan  on
      grounds of having insulted the president. He  stated  that  there  was
      little detail reported as to how  the  Uzbek  authorities  reacted  to
      returnees who had claimed asylum, but  referred  to  the  case  of  an
      asylum-seeker, Alisher Khakimjanov, whose father had been arrested  in
      Uzbekistan on charges of participating in the events in  Andijan,  who
      was facing deportation from the United Kingdom and who was  considered
      to be at risk of imprisonment if he were to return to  Uzbekistan.  He
      also referred to two cases of Azizbek Rakhimov and Alisher Ubaydullaev
      known to the Association for Human Rights in Asia, who were imprisoned
      on return to Uzbekistan after being deported from the United  Kingdom.
      Mr Chenciner admitted, however, in his oral evidence, that no-one  had
      been able to find any reports about what actually happened  to  people
      forcibly returned to Uzbekistan.

  59. In an addendum to his report, and in response  to  Miss  Farquharson's
      concern  about  the  authenticity  of  the  propiska  stamp   in   the
      appellant's passport, he concluded that the stamp was valid.

  60. Having had the opportunity of viewing the  original  passport  at  the
      hearing, Mr Chenciner considered that the passport was genuine and  he
      maintained his view, having consulted his friend  Mr  Hamid  Ismailov,
      the head of BBC Central Asian  &  Caucasus  World  Service,  that  the
      propiska stamp was genuine. His evidence was that the appellant  could
      apply to have her child registered in her passport at  the  Uzbekistan
      Consulate in the United Kingdom and that that would not put her at any
      risk on return. However, his overall view was that the  appellant  was
      at risk of being detained as a  result  of  the  fake  United  Kingdom
      residence permit in her passport bringing her to the attention of  the
      Uzbek authorities and as a result of  having  claimed  asylum  in  the
      United Kingdom.

Respondent's Submissions

Skeleton Argument

  61. In his skeleton argument, Mr Deller set out the  relevant  issues  and
      noted that the Convention reason pleaded in the appellant's  case  was
      imputed political opinion in relation to her expired exit  permit.  He
      submitted that Mr Chenciner, in his report, had gone beyond the agreed
      parameters  of  the  case  by  commenting  on  the   credibility   and
      plausibility of the appellant's claim. Mr Chenciner's statement,  that
      claiming asylum would be perceived as insulting the President, was not
      supported by any evidence of failed asylum seekers being detained  and
      mistreated for that reason alone. His comments about  the  appellant's
      likely  treatment  on  return  to  the  airport  in  Uzbekistan   were
      speculative, not based on any objective evidence, and  should  not  be
      accepted.

  62. With regard to Miss Farquharson's first report,  Mr  Deller  submitted
      that the examples given of people being prosecuted under  Article  223
      of the Criminal Code did not show that that was reasonably  likely  to
      happen to those who had no  previous  political  profile,  since  they
      related to people linked to  the  massacre  in  Andijan  or  who  were
      suspected  of  Islamist  activities.  Mr  Deller   noted   that   Miss
      Farquharson seemed to accept the contention that expiry of a  lawfully
      obtained exit stamp did not entail problems in Uzbekistan, as was  the
      Secretary of State's case, and that the appellant had never claimed to
      have left Uzbekistan illegally. With regard to  the  addendum  to  the
      report, Mr Deller submitted that whilst  Miss  Farquharson  seemed  to
      question the validity of part of the passport, to which her  expertise
      was not accepted, she did not appear to challenge the validity of  the
      exit stamp. She accepted that the appellant would not be  at  risk  in
      the way claimed in her first report. Her final opinion  was  therefore
      in stark contrast to that of Mr Chenciner.

  63. With regard  to  the  ARC  document,  Mr  Deller  submitted  that  the
      compilers of the report were not country experts and did  not  profess
      to give expert opinion. He commented on the examples provided  in  the
      report of people detained on return to  Uzbekistan,  noting  that  the
      examples given were of people linked to the Andijan massacres or  were
      too vague.

  64. Mr Deller relied upon the  FCO  letters  of  2009  and  2010  and  the
      decision of the ECtHR in NM and  MM.   He  submitted  that  the  AIT's
      country guidance in OM  remained  valid  and  asked  the  Tribunal  to
      dismiss the appeal.

Oral submissions

  65. Mr Deller relied on his skeleton argument. He made no strong challenge
      to the evidence of the experts and submitted  that  their  credentials
      were not particularly challenged, although he  expressed  reservations
      about their evidence in certain respects.

  66. With regard to  Mr  Chenciner,  he  acknowledged  that  he  had  given
      evidence with approval in a number of former Soviet  Union  cases  but
      submitted that he had strayed off to an extent in this  case  and  had
      dealt with  matters  that  were  not  in  issue.  In  any  event,  his
      conclusions in regard to the risk from the  appellant's  husband  were
      undermined by the fact that, contrary to his belief, the father of the
      child was not named in the birth certificate. His conclusion that  any
      asylum seeker would be at risk on return was speculative and  was  not
      supported by any evidence. The evidence did not demonstrate that there
      was a real risk on such a basis. The Uzbek authorities would not  know
      that the appellant had claimed asylum and a one-way ticket  would  not
      necessarily mean anything.  Whilst  there  was  a  suggestion  in  the
      background evidence that the United Kingdom and Uzbekistan were not on
      the best of terms, that was not sufficient to say that a  return  from
      the United Kingdom was an exacerbating factor. There was  evidence  of
      people being removed to Uzbekistan and, whilst there was no record  of
      what happened to them on return, one would expect there to be  reports
      of problems if such problems had occurred.

  67. With regard to Miss Farquharson,  Mr  Deller  did  not  challenge  her
      expertise in general and  acknowledged  that  her  evidence  had  been
      accepted before the Court of  Appeal  in  the  case  of  LS.  He  did,
      however, express some reservations as to her knowledge of  the  format
      of documents relevant to the appellant's individual circumstances  and
      questioned whether it was possible to have a definitive  knowledge  of
      formats of documentation over  time.  In  the  appellant's  case,  her
      passport looked like a genuine one, as all the details appeared to  be
      correct. The  exit  visa  looked  like  a  perfectly  good  one.  Miss
      Farquharson found nothing wrong with the  visa  itself  but  was  just
      concerned about its context.

  68. As to the general  risk  on  return,  Mr  Deller  submitted  that  the
      references in the expert reports and background  material  to  certain
      people returning to Uzbekistan indicated that some  particular  groups
      might be of adverse interest to the Uzbek authorities, such  as  those
      associated with the  Andijan  massacres,  or  those  with  a  previous
      political profile in Uzbekistan. The case of Alisher  Khakimjanov  was
      not on all fours with the appellant's situation, since he had links to
      the Andijan massacre.

  69.  Mr Deller accepted that the appellant had produced what  appeared  to
      be a genuine  Uzbek  passport  containing  a  genuine  exit  visa.  He
      referred to the relevant case law, namely OM, LS and NM and  MM,  with
      regard to the general risk to Uzbek returnees with expired exit visas.
      With respect to the latter, he noted that reliance had been placed  by
      the Court upon the letters from the FCO  despite  the  fact  that  the
      letters were anonymised, and the Court  had  not  raised  any  of  the
      concerns that arose in Sufi and Elmi v the United  Kingdom  -  8319/07
      [2011] ECHR 1045 in regard to non-attributable evidence. The  evidence
      now  presented  was  not  'non-attributable'  at  the  level  of   the
      anonymised evidence produced in Sufi and Elmi: there was no reason  to
      disbelieve the assertion by the FCO that the source of its information
      was a reputable law firm in Tashkent.  The Tribunal should accept  and
      give weight to the evidence in the letters.

  70. Mr Deller  accepted  Article  223  of  the  Uzbek  Criminal  Code  was
      potentially persecutory; the question for the Tribunal was whether  it
      was  persecutory  as  implemented  by  the  Uzbek  authorities.    The
      appellant could  approach  the  Uzbekistan  Consulate  in  the  United
      Kingdom to renew any expired endorsement in her  passport  and  if  an
      extension on her exit visa was necessary, she  could  be  expected  to
      take advantage of that facility.  Once rectified, she would  not  have
      an expired  exit  visa  on  return  and  would  be  in  no  difficulty
      whatsoever.   The appellant had not, as required,  registered  herself
      with the Consulate, or registered her  United  Kingdom-born  daughter,
      but remedial powers existed.

  71. Mr Deller accepted that the appellant should succeed in her  claim  if
      she  established  that  she  would  be  detained  at  the  airport  in
      Uzbekistan on return, given the findings in Ergashev  and  considering
      section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  and
      the best interests of her child.

Appellant's Submissions

Skeleton Argument

  72. Mr Vokes relied upon various  examples  in  the  background  evidence,
      including the Amnesty  International  submission,  of  people  charged
      under Article 223 of the Criminal Code for having no  exit  stamps  in
      their passport, as well as for having  remained  out  of  the  country
      after the expiry of their exit stamps. He submitted that  as  a  woman
      with a young child,  the  appellant  would  be  subject  to  increased
      scrutiny on arrival at the airport. He referred to the report from  Ms
      Marjorie Farquharson who had cited cases where the authorities had had
      an existing interest in persons who had left the country and  remained
      without authorisation and it was noted that  she  did  not  appear  to
      agree with the conclusions in OM. He also referred to the report of Mr
      Chenciner and to his conclusion that the fact of applying  for  asylum
      abroad could lead to  charges  under  Articles  139  and  140  of  the
      Criminal Code.

  73. Mr Vokes submitted that the views taken in NM  and  MM  v  UK  and  OM
      should be re-assessed in the light of the further expert evidence  and
      the  background  material  which,  he  contended,  was  sufficient  to
      indicate that a person in whom there was no previous interest  by  the
      Uzbek authorities could nevertheless be at risk  on  return.   In  the
      light of the irregular documentation on which she would  be  returned,
      this appellant would be stopped and detained at the airport,  and  the
      international evidence disclosed  a  clear  risk  that  she  would  be
      subject to ill-treatment in detention. She would be at risk of  facing
      criminal   proceedings   under   the   Criminal   Code   and   of    a
      disproportionately heavy penalty pursuant to Article 223.

Oral submissions

  74. In his oral submissions, Mr Vokes relied upon the ARC report.  The ARC
      had been recognised previously by the  Tribunal  in  the  case  of  AK
      (Article  15(c))  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT  163  as   independent
      compilers of country research information. At page 5 of  that  report,
      ARC referred to the cases of several women who had been  charged  with
      violation of the  conditions  of  their  exit  visas  upon  return  to
      Uzbekistan. Mr Vokes submitted that there appeared to be a  propensity
      to charge failed asylum seekers with political crimes. Page 7  of  the
      report gave details of suspects  being  detained,  and  therefore  the
      problem arose not only for those charged with offences  but  also  for
      those suspected of such offences. In view of the concession made as to
      the fact of ill-treatment in detention  in  Uzbekistan,  the  relevant
      question was whether there would be a period of detention.

  75. Mr Vokes then turned to Miss Farquharson's report and to her reference
      to students and labour migrants no longer being able  to  renew  their
      exit permits in their nearest  Uzbekistan  Consulates.  He  relied  in
      particular on her description of the case  of  an  Uzbek  student  who
      failed to return home to renew her passport and was sentenced to  five
      years imprisonment on  return  to  Uzbekistan.  Uzbek  Embassies  were
      actively scanning local media and internet  for  reference  to  Uzbeks
      abroad. If the appellant went to  the  Consulate  to  renew  her  exit
      permit and to register herself, that would be recorded  by  the  Uzbek
      authorities.

  76. Mr Vokes accepted that many of the examples of people facing  problems
      on return to Uzbekistan related  either  to  political  dissidents  or
      those involved in the Andijan massacres. However,  he  submitted  that
      the evidence before the Tribunal supported a finding that there was  a
      generalised risk, at least to some returnees with expired exit  visas.



  77. With regard to Mr Chenciner's report, Mr Vokes  noted  Mr  Chenciner's
      view that failed asylum seekers were at risk as a result  of  Articles
      139 and 140 of the Criminal Code, which made insulting the  president,
      for example, by claiming asylum, punishable by imprisonment of  up  to
      six years. Mr Vokes did not ask the Tribunal to  accept  such  a  wide
      view or to accept that a failed asylum  seeker  returning  within  the
      exit visa period would be identified as an asylum seeker; rather,  his
      contention  was  that  where  there  was  anything  in  a   returnee's
      documentation that would alert the authorities that they  had  claimed
      asylum, the risk under Articles 139-140 would be triggered.

  78.  There  needed  to  be  something  wrong  or  some  failure   in   the
      documentation,  in  order  to  draw  the  attention   of   the   Uzbek
      authorities. The fate of the two returnees  from  the  United  Kingdom
      referred to in Mr Chenciner's report ought to be  of  concern  to  the
      Tribunal. There was no information about what had happened to them.

  79. With regard to the  letters  from  the  FCO,  Mr  Vokes  accepted  the
      submission made by Mr Deller in regard to the Sufi and Elmi point, but
      argued that the information in the letters could  not  be  treated  as
      reliable, since  the  Tashkent  law  firm  providing  the  advice  was
      government-licensed, as were all Uzbek law firms, as confirmed in  the
      ARC  report.    Further,  the  evidence  in  the   FCO   letters   was
      contradictory, as the statement that the Ministry of Interior  kept  a
      record of all exit visas and checked them at the  airport  on  return,
      was inconsistent with the statement that the  exit  visa  confirmed  a
      right to exit only. Mr Vokes  submitted  that  the  reality  was  that
      Article 223, and possibly also Articles 139-140 of the  Criminal  Code
      existed, and that their application was  at  the  whim  of  the  Uzbek
      authorities.

  80. Mr Vokes submitted that there were two issues for the  Upper  Tribunal
      to consider, as set out in the evidence of Mr Chenciner:

   a) As a failed asylum claimant, would a political opinion be  imputed  to
      the appellant, and would she be  considered  as  having  insulted  the
      Uzbek State and its President?

   b) If Uzbek administrative procedures in investigating her return without
      the correct documents would lead to detention, would  that  entail  an
      Article 3 risk because of the treatment of detainees and the  possible
      discovery of the appellant's asylum claim and the consequences of that
      discovery?

  81. Mr  Vokes  submitted  that  the  appellant's  case  and  that  of  the
      respondent were not far apart  in  regard  to  the  character  of  the
      country evidence, the nature of the regime  and  the  consequences  to
      perceived oppositionists to that regime. The room  for  assessment  of
      risk was very narrow and the question of risk came down to  the  issue
      of people with irregularities in their passports.

  82. Turning to the particular circumstances of the appellant,  there  were
      doubts about her travel documents and it was known for sure  that  she
      had one false  entry  in  her  passport,  namely  her  United  Kingdom
      residence permit. There were serious doubts about whether her propiska
      was genuine.  Before returning to Uzbekistan, she would be required to
      approach the Uzbekistan Consulate  to  renew  her  exit  visa  and  to
      explain the delay in  registering  herself  and  her  child  with  the
      Consulate.  That  information  would  be  noted,  sent  back  to   the
      authorities in Uzbekistan and entered into their computer records.  Mr
      Vokes submitted that such information  was  more  than  sufficient  to
      place the appellant at risk:  she  would  either  be  stopped  at  the
      airport or picked up at home when the local authorities  in  Samarkand
      noticed the large gap between the dates of her entry and exit.

  83. In either case, there was a real risk that she would be detained  and,
      even if she were subsequently released as being of no interest to  the
      authorities, the respondent had accepted that she would be ill-treated
      in detention. The risk was greater for her as  a  lone  woman  with  a
      young child; whilst that was not in itself  a  persecutory  risk,  she
      might well be asked to explain what she had been doing  while  outside
      the country, and the resultant scrutiny would  flag  up  her  overlong
      absence, as well as the irregularities in her passport.

  84. At this point, we sought to clarify if  any  point  were  being  taken
      pursuant to RT (Zimbabwe) & Ors v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2010] EWCA Civ 1285, which had been heard in  the  Supreme
      Court and in which judgment was awaited.  Mr Vokes stated that he  did
      not seek to rely on anything at issue in RT and we have not  therefore
      taken that point any further.

Assessment of the Expert Evidence

Miss Marjorie Farquharson

  85. Whilst we accept that Miss Farquharson is an expert in relation to the
      Uzbek legislation on exit and entry to the country, we do  not  accept
      that she is a forgery  expert.  Her  expert  evidence  in  LS  was  in
      relation to Article 223 of the Uzbek Criminal Code and the effects  of
      illegal or unauthorised exit from the country, matters clearly  within
      her remit of expertise. However, before us she was seeking  to  extend
      that remit  and  admitted  to  presenting  views  based  on  "informed
      speculation" in regard to the appellant's passport.

  86. Her views as to the validity of the passport  fluctuated  to  such  an
      extent that we were unable to rely confidently on any  of  the  three,
      mutually inconsistent views she took of the  likely  validity  of  the
      passport and its stamps.  Whilst we accept that Miss Farquharson is an
      honest and intelligent witness, and had  recently  seen  some  of  the
      current passports and propiska stamps while researching in Uzbekistan,
      her knowledge did not amount to expertise, and particularly not as  to
      the past format of such documents  and  the  stamps  and  endorsements
      therein.  In addition, her  view  that  the  propiska  stamp  was  not
      authentic was directly contradicted by Mr Chenciner, who considered it
      likely to be genuine.

  87. The confusion in  Miss  Farquharson's  evidence  was  crucial  to  her
      consideration  of  risk  on  return  by  reason  of  the   appellant's
      documents.  In her second report, she stated as her opinion  that  the
      passport was genuine and that, whilst the  propiska  at  page  12  was
      dubious, the appellant would have no problems on return to  Uzbekistan
      in view of the authentic nature of  her  exit  visa.  However  at  the
      hearing her evidence was that the passport was not  genuine  and  that
      the appellant may or may not have problems on return to Uzbekistan  as
      a result.

  88. Miss Farquharson's evidence on the risk to the appellant as  a  failed
      asylum-seeker also evolved over time.  Whilst  she  concluded  in  her
      first report that return to Uzbekistan as a failed asylum seeker would
      make the appellant liable to the same  treatment  as  the  individuals
      described in the cases she had cited, she appeared no longer  to  have
      those concerns in her supplementary report. There, she concluded  that
      since the appellant had no record of political dissension or  conflict
      with the Uzbek authorities, she would not  risk  the  reprisals  those
      individuals faced. In her oral evidence, Miss Farquharson returned  to
      her original position, that deportation to Uzbekistan would be profile
      enough to ensure adverse interest by the Uzbek  authorities.  We  have
      concluded that her evidence on this point is speculative and that  she
      herself is uncertain what the relevant risk factors are in relation to
      removal of an asylum seeker with no other adverse factors.

Mr Robert Chenciner

  89. We agree with Mr Deller that Mr Chenciner's evidence goes well  beyond
      the parameters of the case, providing opinion as to the risks faced by
      the appellant from her husband, a matter which is no longer in issue.

  90. In relation to risk on return, Mr Chenciner's evidence  was  that  all
      asylum seekers are at risk on return to Uzbekistan because they  would
      be  considered  as  having   thereby   insulted   the   president   in
      contravention of Articles 139 and 140 of the Criminal  Code.  However,
      none of the cases he referred to in his report by way of example  were
      asylum seekers simpliciter, but were dissidents or persons  associated
      with the Andijan massacre. In his report, he  acknowledged  that  very
      little  detailed  information  was  available  as  to  how  the  Uzbek
      authorities reacted to the return of a known failed asylum seeker. The
      statistics he provided on returns to  Uzbekistan  were  insufficiently
      broken down to assist with that question. The  sole  detailed  example
      provided of a failed asylum seeker considered to be at risk on  return
      was that of Alisher Khakimjanov, who risked imprisonment on return  to
      Uzbekistan.  However,  Mr  Khakimjanov  has  not  been   returned   to
      Uzbekistan and in any event, as is made clear in the report  contained
      in the appellant's evidence, he was perceived to  have  links  to  the
      2005 Andijan uprising. The reference  to  the  two  cases  of  Azizbek
      Rakhimov  and  Alisher  Ubaydullaev  was  taken  directly   from   the
      shahidayakub internet article and in turn came  from  another  source,
      the Association for Human Rights in Asia. None of these  provided  any
      details of the cases or confirmed an absence of links to  the  Andijan
      uprising.

  91. Accordingly, whilst we recognise that Mr Chenciner's  expert  evidence
      has assisted the Tribunal in the past, we consider that the  value  of
      his evidence in this appeal is reduced by a tendency to stray into the
      realms  of  speculation.  We  have  therefore  exercised  caution   in
      considering his conclusions in regard to risk on return.

Discussion

  92. Detention conditions in Uzbekistan are unsatisfactory.

  93. In Ergashev v Russia, the Court  said  this  about  the  treatment  of
      detainees in Uzbekistan:
    "112.  As regards the applicant's allegation that detainees suffer ill-
    treatment in Uzbekistan, the Court has  recently  acknowledged  that  a
    general problem still persists in that country in this regard (see, for
    example, Karimov v. Russia, no.  54219/08,  ��  79-85,  29  July  2010;
    Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, no. 2947/06, �� 120-121, 24 April  2008;
    and Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, �� 93-96, 11 December  2008).  No
    concrete evidence has been  produced  to  demonstrate  any  fundamental
    improvement in this field in Uzbekistan in  the  last  few  years  (see
    paragraphs 100, 101, 103 and 104 above). The Court therefore  considers
    that the ill-treatment of detainees is a pervasive and enduring problem
    in Uzbekistan. ...
    114.  ... Given that the practice of torture in Uzbekistan is described
    by reputable international sources as  systematic,  the  Court  is  not
    persuaded that the assurances from  the  Uzbek  authorities  offered  a
    reliable guarantee against the risk of ill-treatment.
    115.  Accordingly, the applicant's forcible return to Uzbekistan would
    give rise to a violation of Article 3 as he would face a  serious  risk
    of being subjected there to torture or inhuman or degrading  treatment.
    Therefore, the Court decides to maintain the application of Rule 39  of
    the Rules of Court."

  94. In the light of that decision and of the support for it in both expert
      reports, in the ARC report, and country background information  before
      us, it is accepted that where an appellant is at risk of detention  on
      return to Uzbekistan, whether as  a  result  of  charges  and  pending
      prosecution, or on a short-term basis pending enquiries on  the  basis
      of suspicion of  illegality,  such  appellant  would  be  entitled  to
      succeed under Article 3 of the ECHR.

  95. The country guidance issue therefore is whether, as suggested  to  the
      Court of Appeal in  LS  (Uzbekistan),  the  current  country  evidence
      supports a finding that Uzbek citizens returning  to  Uzbekistan  from
      abroad, after their exit permits have expired, are  at  real  risk  of
      detention or of disproportionate punishment on return.

  96. Miss Farquharson's evidence in LS,  as  in  this  appeal,  principally
      concerned the application of Article 223 of the Uzbek  Criminal  Code.
      The appellant in LS was a flight attendant, leaving the  country  only
      for short periods for her work and fell into a different  category  of
      penalty  under  Article  223,  reserved  for  state  employees.   This
      appellant is not a state employee.

  97. The concerns arising from the Amnesty International report of 28 April
      2009 derived from its statement that:

    "Illegal exit abroad or illegal  entry  into  Uzbekistan,  including  by
   overstaying the permission to travel abroad or failing to renew  it,  are
   punishable under Article 223 of the Criminal  Code  with  fines  or  with
   imprisonment from three to five years or in aggravated  circumstances  by
   up to 10 years' imprisonment."

The words "including by overstaying  the  permission  to  travel  abroad  or
failing to renew it" clearly suggested that the provisions  of  Article  223
applied both to illegal exit and to overstaying  a  lawful  exit.   If  that
were correct, then OM would have been wrongly decided.

  98.  The  Amnesty  International  evidence  reported   a   tightening   of
      regulations for Uzbek citizens travelling abroad,  in  particular  for
      Uzbeks studying abroad, such that "in some instances", Uzbek  citizens
      could no longer renew their permissions or exit visas in their nearest
      Uzbekistan Consulate, being required instead to return  to  Uzbekistan
      and renew at the local Department of Internal Affairs which gave  them
      their original permit.  Miss Farquharson endorsed that view.  However,
      no details of those new regulations were provided for  us,  either  by
      Miss Farquharson or by Amnesty International, nor  did  they  indicate
      what was meant by "in some instances". We do not consider that we  can
      place weight on this evidence in preference to the  terms  of  Article
      223 itself.

  99.  The  Amnesty  International   report   is   anecdotal   rather   than
      comprehensive, and in particular, does not provide a full  account  of
      the cases which led to the stated conclusions, nor give the source  of
      the  information  underlying  those   conclusions.    The   one   case
      particularised in the Amnesty International report appears to  be  the
      same as that described by Miss Farquharson in her  report,  suggesting
      that the information came from the same sources, which she  stated  to
      be the Director of the Ecole des Etudes de Sciences Sociales in  Paris
      and the Le Mans-based Association for Human Rights  in  Central  Asia.
      The case of a law student on an expired exit permit in France was well
      known in �migr� human rights circles and was reported closely by them,
      giving the student a public profile that would have drawn her  to  the
      attention of the Uzbek authorities. That was not  made  clear  in  the
      Amnesty International report and plainly  undermines  the  conclusions
      they reached.

 100. Amnesty  International's  concerns  were  considered,  but  not  given
      weight, by the ECtHR in the case of NM and MM. The ECtHR rejected  the
      applications as inadmissible, inter alia because the applicants had no
      profile with the Uzbek authorities and because there was  no  reliable
      evidence before that Court indicating that  OM  had  been  incorrectly
      decided on that point.  We reject Mr Vokes' submission that we  should
      give no weight to the FCO  letters  or,  implicitly,  to  the  ECtHR's
      assessment, based upon them, that  overstaying  permission  to  travel
      abroad was not punishable under Article 223 and  that  there  were  no
      penalties for returning to Uzbekistan after  the  expiry  of  an  exit
      visa.

 101. Nor do we agree with Mr Vokes that the expert evidence and  background
      information now before us is such as to lead to a re-assessment of the
      position in NM and MM. Miss Farquharson's  reports  acknowledged  that
      the cases she had been able  to  find  of  risk  on  return  concerned
      persons whose previous brushes with the Uzbek authorities had led them
      to move abroad and who  had  past  associations  with  the  events  in
      Andijan or with Islamist militant activities. It is relevant  to  note
      that at paragraph 12 of the addendum to her report she concluded that,
      since the appellant had no record of political dissension or  conflict
      with the Uzbek authorities, she may not risk the  reprisals  faced  by
      those with a profile of  dissent  or  associations  with  the  Andijan
      massacre. The same can be said of the examples given in  the  ARC  and
      Amnesty International reports.

 102. Having thus carefully considered all the cases cited  as  examples  of
      the practice of the Uzbek authorities of charging  its  citizens  with
      illegal exit under Article 223 of the Criminal Code,  following  their
      return to Uzbekistan with expired exit permits, we find that each  has
      particular features distinguishing it, either by way  of  pre-existing
      interest by the authorities, association with the events  in  Andijan,
      association with Islamic militant activity,  or  travel  to  countries
      other than that authorised in the exit permit. In all of  those  cases
      it was, we find, those distinguishing features that led to their  exit
      from Uzbekistan being considered as illegal. There is nothing  in  the
      evidence before us to support a finding that Uzbek citizens  returning
      to Uzbekistan from abroad, after their exit permits have expired,  are
      at real risk of detention or of disproportionate punishment on  return
      simply on the basis of having an expired exit permit.

 103. We reject the opinions of both Miss Farquharson and Mr Chenciner, that
      the appellant would be at risk on return to  Uzbekistan  as  a  failed
      asylum seeker, for the reasons we have already given.  As  regards  Mr
      Chenciner's opinion that a returned asylum seeker on a one way  ticket
      would be at risk of prosecution under Articles  139  and  140  of  the
      Criminal  Code  for  having  insulted  the  President,  such  view  is
      speculative and unsupported by any background information or evidence,
      and we are unable to place any significant weight upon it,  given  our
      concerns about Mr Chenciner's evidence overall.

 104. We have considered whether failure to register either herself  or  her
      daughter with the Uzbekistan Consulate in the United Kingdom puts  the
      appellant at any additional risk. In this respect, Miss  Farquharson's
      view, that it was a  legal  requirement  for  all  Uzbek  citizens  to
      register with the appropriate Uzbekistan Embassy  on  arrival  in  the
      foreign country, is contradicted by the information provided in the US
      Department of  State  report  of  24  May  2012  to  the  effect  that
      registration with Uzbekistan Consulates abroad was voluntary. That  is
      supported by  the  opinion  of  Mr  Chenciner  that,  in  effect,  the
      appellant could register herself and her child  now,  without  putting
      herself at risk on return.

 105. The evidence before us does not satisfy us that failure to register at
      the local Uzbekistan Consulate immediately, or soon after arrival in a
      foreign country results in adverse attention or problems  upon  return
      to Uzbekistan:  if that were the case, we consider that there would be
      specific examples available which could have been cited to us  by  the
      experts, or appeared in the US State Department  Report.  Overall,  we
      consider that the appellant  has  not  demonstrated  that  periods  of
      residence abroad, whether as an  asylum  seeker  or  otherwise,  where
      there has been no pre-existing interest in an individual by the  Uzbek
      authorities, would lead to problems on return.

General Conclusions

 106. In the light of all the evidence, submissions, and authorities set out
      above,  we  have  reached  the  following  general  country   guidance
      conclusions:


   (1) Article 223 of the Uzbekistan Criminal Code (UCC) makes it an offence
   for a citizen to leave the country without permission - what is described
   as "illegal exit abroad". The basic offence of "illegal exit  abroad"  is
   punishable by a fine or by imprisonment for between three to five  years.




   (2) In specified aggravating circumstances  (a  physical  breach  of  the
   border, conspiracy, or the exit abroad  of  a  state  employee  requiring
   special permission) the penalty for "illegal exit abroad"  under  Article
   223 of the UCC rises to five to ten years' imprisonment.  It  is  unclear
   from the evidence before us whether a fine will also be imposed.


   (3) Uzbek citizens are required to obtain an exit permit prior to leaving
   the country.  However, Annex 1  to  the  Resolution  of  the  Council  of
   Ministers No. 8, issued on 06.01.1995, provides that no  penalties  apply
   to someone who returns to Uzbekistan  after  the  expiry  of  their  exit
   permit. Normally, exit permits can be renewed at the  Uzbekistan  Embassy
   in the third country where an Uzbek citizen is living.


   (4) There are cases of Uzbek nationals, having left the country lawfully,
   nevertheless being charged with  "illegal  exit  abroad"  and  prosecuted
   under Article 223 following their return to Uzbekistan with expired  exit
   permits. However, those  cases  involved  pre-existing  interest  by  the
   authorities, association with the events in Andijan in 2005,  association
   with Islamic militant activity,  travel  to  countries  other  than  that
   authorised in the exit permit or other such distinguishing features.

   (5) There is no evidence of prosecutions under Article 223 of the UCC  of
   ordinary returning Uzbek citizens with expired  exit  permits,  including
   failed asylum seekers, where such individuals had no  particular  profile
   or distinguishing features which would otherwise have led to any  adverse
   interest in them.  It  has  therefore  not  been  established  that  such
   returnees are at real risk of persecution on return.

   (6) The ill-treatment of detainees is a pervasive and enduring problem in
   Uzbekistan, for which there is no concrete evidence  of  any  fundamental
   improvement in recent years (Ergashev v Russia [2009] ECtHR 12106/09 ECHR
   2249).  Therefore, where an Uzbek citizen is likely  to  be  detained  on
   return, Article 3 ECHR will be engaged.

   (7) The country guidance given by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  in
   OM (Returning citizens, minorities, religion) Uzbekistan CG [2007]  UKAIT
   00045 is re-affirmed.

The Appellant's Claim

 107. We now apply our findings on the issues above to the specific facts of
      the appellant's case. We have already set out the details of her claim
      earlier on in the determination. For the sake of clarity,  we  confirm
      that the appellant has not sought to challenge the adverse findings of
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge in regard to her initial claim  to  fear
      persecution from her husband and neither is she seeking to pursue  the
      risk factor of returning to a Muslim country with a child born out  of
      wedlock.

 108. In addition, Mr Vokes confirmed that her more recent claim, raised for
      the first time in her latest  statement,  to  be  in  the  process  of
      converting to Christianity and  to  be  involved  with  the  Jehovah's
      Witness community, was not a matter pursued before us and  was  not  a
      matter for us to consider, although he was aware that this appeal  was
      a vehicle for doing so, if that argument were relied upon.

 109. The only issue to be determined, therefore,  is  as  regards  her  sur
      place claim with respect to the expiry of  her  exit  permit  and  any
      adverse interest the Uzbek authorities would take in her on return  as
      a result.  The appellant is a  person  with  no  actual  or  perceived
      oppositionist or political profile in Uzbekistan and it has never been
      suggested that she has any links to the Andijan massacre.

 110. We do not consider that the state of the appellant's documents, and in
      particular her passport, are such as to result in problems for her  on
      return to Uzbekistan. We place no weight on the  concerns  which  Miss
      Farquharson raised at  the  hearing  regarding  the  validity  of  the
      appellant's passport:  the respondent has never sought to  argue  that
      the passport itself was a forgery, and  nor  had  the  appellant,  who
      chose not to give evidence or to remain in the hearing room while  the
      appeal was heard before us.  We accept that the  passport  contains  a
      forged residence permit for the United Kingdom.

 111. Miss  Farquharson's  concerns  about  the  propiska  (page  8  of  the
      passport) are not within her expertise, and are based upon  much  more
      recent passports than that held by this appellant.   The  evidence  of
      Miss Farquharson and of Amnesty International is that procedures  have
      been refined in recent years.   Mr Chenciner disagreed with  her,  and
      Miss  Farquharson  herself  said  her  evidence  on  this  point   was
      speculative.  We treat the propiska as genuine.

 112. The most important consideration is that it is accepted by all parties
      that the exit permit (at page 12 of the  passport)  is  genuine.  Miss
      Farquharson's conclusion, in particular in the addendum to her report,
      was that the appellant would not be at risk of being treated as a case
      of 'illegal exit abroad' since she had a genuine and valid exit permit
      and that she would not be penalised for having failed to renew it. She
      did not suggest that the absence of an exit sticker on the outside  of
      the appellant's passport would cause her any problems.

 113. Nor do we consider that the failure to register herself and the  child
      promptly at the Uzbekistan Consulate in London is likely to cause  the
      appellant problems on her  return  to  Uzbekistan.   On  the  evidence
      before us, we find that it remains open to the appellant  to  register
      herself and her child at the Uzbekistan Consulate before returning and
      that any concern as to the delay in having done  so  could  easily  be
      explained by the fact that her passport had until recently  been  held
      by the UKBA. We do  not  accept  that  reference  to  the  UKBA  would
      immediately arouse suspicions of an asylum claim, since the UKBA could
      equally have  held  her  passport  in  relation  to  applications  for
      residence on any number of other grounds.

 114. In any event,  in  the  light  of  our  general  observations  on  the
      evidence, we find no grounds for concluding that merely having claimed
      asylum would place the appellant at  risk  on  return  to  Uzbekistan.
      Neither do we find any  grounds  for  concluding  that  the  false  UK
      residence stamp in the appellant's passport would cause the  appellant
      problems on return to Uzbekistan: we consider that even if  the  Uzbek
      authorities did notice that the residence permit was false  -  and  we
      see no grounds for concluding that they would - there is no reason why
      that should be of any interest to them since it did not involve  their
      own documentation.

 115. We find that neither individually nor  cumulatively  would  the  above
      factors, namely the absence of an exit sticker on the outside  of  her
      passport, her expired exit permit, her failure to register herself and
      her child at the Uzbekistan Consulate in  London,  her  forged  United
      Kingdom residence permit or  her  unsuccessful  asylum  claim  in  the
      United Kingdom, put the appellant at risk on return to Uzbekistan.

 116. For the  reasons  given  above,  and  in  the  light  of  our  general
      conclusions, we do not consider that there is  a  real  risk  of  this
      appellant being subjected,  on  return  to  Uzbekistan,  to  treatment
      amounting to persecution or serious harm.  For  the  same  reasons  we
      consider that the appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection
      and that her removal to Uzbekistan would not breach Article 3  of  the
      ECHR.

 117. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal in regard to Article 8 of  the
      ECHR were not challenged by the appellant and did not form part of the
      order for reconsideration. As such they  remain  undisturbed.  In  any
      event, Article 8 was  not  pursued  before  us  and  no  evidence  was
      produced to suggest any departure from the decision of the  First-tier
      Tribunal.

DECISION

 118. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law. The decision has been set aside.
      We re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on all grounds.



      Anonymity

    In order to secure the anonymity  of  the  appellant  throughout  these
    proceedings we direct, pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, that no report  or  other  publication  of
    these proceedings or of any  part  or  parts  of  them  shall  name  or
    directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.  Reference  to  the
    appellant may be by use of her initials but not by name.

            Funding

    The Tribunal is satisfied that, at the  time  the  appellant  made  the
    section 103A application and for the reasons indicated in the order for
    reconsideration, there was a real possibility that the appeal would  be
    allowed  upon  reconsideration.  Accordingly   it   orders   that   the
    appellant's costs in respect of the application for reconsideration and
    in respect of the reconsideration are to be paid out  of  the  relevant
    fund, as defined in rule 33 of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Representation:

For the Appellant:    Mr Zilli of Counsel
For the Respondent:  Ms I Isherwood Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

     1. The appellant is a female citizen of Uzbekistan, born in 1978,  who
        came to the United Kingdom in 2008 on a student visa;  she  claimed
        asylum  and  her  appeal  against  refusal  was  dismissed   in   a
        determination dated 29 December 2009 by Immigration Judge Abebrese.


     2. The principal issue before the Immigration Judge was the claim that
        the appellant would suffer abusive  treatment  from  her  estranged
        husband upon return to Uzbekistan.  That basis was rejected and has
        not since been pursued.


     3. At the hearing before him a new point was raised  with  permission.
        This new  point  concerned  whether  the  appellant  who  had  left
        Uzbekistan with the benefit of an exit visa, but  whose  exit  visa
        had expired while  she  was  in  the  United  Kingdom,  would  face
        persecutory or disproportionate punishment on  return  because  she
        had overstayed her absence from the country.  It was  contended  by
        the Secretary of State and accepted by the Immigration  Judge  that
        the decision of OM (Returnees Citizen-Minority-Religion) Uzbekistan
        CG [2007] UKAIT 00045 held that it had not  been  established  that
        Uzbek citizens whose passports expired could not obtain  a  renewal
        from embassies abroad or that returnees who had been abroad  for  a
        longer  period  than   permitted   were   at   a   real   risk   of
        disproportionate punishment on return.

     4. It was contended on the application for  reconsideration  that  the
        Immigration Judge had not addressed the evidence  provided  by  the
        appellant which it was submitted  had  provided  information  going
        beyond that which  had  been  available  to  the  Tribunal  in  its
        determination of OM.  In particular, he had been provided  with  an
        Amnesty International Report which had not been considered  in  OM,
        which referred  to  the  offence  of  overstaying  the  exit  visa,
        regulations which in some instances  prevented  nationals  renewing
        their visas outside the country and providing at least one instance
        of a person sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for illegal  exit  or
        overstaying abroad.

     5. Reconsideration was ordered by Senior Immigration Judge Latter on 2
        February 2010  on  the  grounds  that  it  was  arguable  that  the
        Immigration Judge had indeed erred in his legal assessment  of  the
        risk of persecution in the light of the expiry of the exit  permit.
        The matter now comes before us in circumstances where the effect of
        the Procedural Rules and Regulations mean that in effect permission
        to appeal to the Upper Tier has been granted and  it  is  for  this
        Tribunal now to decide whether what Senior Immigration Judge Latter
        held was arguable as an error of law is  indeed  an  error  of  law
        which has had a material effect on the outcome of the case.

     6. We accept Mr Zilli's  submission  that  the  Amnesty  International
        Report which he placed before the  Immigration  Judge  sets  out  a
        different view of the legal position in Uzbekistan in  relation  to
        exit visas from that which was considered by the  Tribunal  in  OM.
        In OM the Tribunal had concluded, as we have said, that it was  not
        satisfied that it was not possible to  obtain  a  passport  renewal
        outside Uzbekistan.   That  was  a  finding  as  to  the  state  of
        evidence.   The  Tribunal  also  concluded  that   there   was   no
        satisfactory evidence to show that a  returnee  was  likely  to  be
        punished  for  having  overstayed   his   absence.    The   Amnesty
        International Report provides chapter and verse in relation to  the
        criminal law in relation to overstaying, and instances a charge and
        conviction for an offence under it and also provides evidence  that
        new regulations were not allowing nationals  to  renew  their  exit
        visas abroad.  The Immigration Judge ought to have considered  that
        evidence and reached a conclusion on its significance for the  case
        he was hearing.  We do not accept that it was sufficient merely  to
        refer OM in those circumstances where there was some evidence which
        cast doubt on what were, at least in one respect,  quite  tentative
        findings.


     7. We have also been referred to the decision of the Court  of  Appeal
        in LS (Uzbekistan) [2008] EWA Civ 909 decided on 30 July 2008, that
        is to say after the decision in OM and before the decision  of  the
        Immigration Judge in this case.  LS (Uzbekistan) also concerned  an
        Uzbek female who in that case had exited  illegally  and  had  lost
        possession of her passport, which up until the start of the hearing
        today, was the position in relation  to  the  appellant's  passport
        here.  The Court of  Appeal  concluded  that  the  evidence  of  an
        expert, Miss Farquharson, before the Tribunal in LS "that it is  an
        offence for citizens of Uzbekistan to  leave  the  country  without
        authority and that those who are charged with criminal offences are
        liable to be ill-treated  by the police", meant that  the  Tribunal
        ought to have given more detailed consideration to this  aspect  of
        the  appellant's  case,  including  explicit  consideration  as  to
        whether there was a real risk of her being charged with an  offence
        and if so, what the consequences might be.  The appeal was  allowed
        and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal.  No one has been  able
        to discover what happened to LS after it returned to the  Tribunal,
        although Mr Zilli says that a  new  report  from  Miss  Farquharson
        refers to the appeal being allowed,  but  no  further  details  are
        available.  The brief endeavours by the Tribunal to establish  what
        happened in that case have been fruitless in one sense, but not  in
        another.  It appears to us to  be  the  case  that,  perhaps  as  a
        consequence of the decision in LS (Uzbekistan), the decision in  OM
        was remitted by consent to the Tribunal.  The outcome  of  that  is
        likewise unknown.  It is perfectly clear that had  the  Immigration
        Judge in this case known what had been decided in LS  (Uzbekistan),
        but the case was not drawn to his attention, he would have  had  to
        consider the Amnesty International Report  as  well  as  what  Miss
        Farquharson was reported as having said in  that  case,  in  a  way
        which he did not do.  The asserted error of law has been made  out.
        It is also impossible for us to say that the  proper  consideration
        of those issues would have made no material difference to the case.
         We cannot say that the decision in OM must inevitably survive  all
        subsequent evidence.


     8. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed to the extent that the decision
        of Immigration Judge Abebrese is set aside.  We cannot  proceed  to
        determine the appeal today.   The  Secretary  of  State  wishes  to
        introduce fresh evidence from Uzbekistan, the appellant  wishes  to
        introduce fresh evidence from Miss Farquharson and at the outset of
        the hearing the hitherto lost passport has emerged at the  back  of
        the Home Office file  available  to  the  Presenting  Officer.   We
        forbear to comment.  But this is clearly  capable  of  affecting  a
        number of aspects of the way in which the evidence  is  considered,
        in particular of the reaction of the Uzbekistan Consular officials.

     9. Accordingly, this case will have to go off for full hearing  before
        the Upper Tribunal.  In the light of what appears to have  happened
        to OM and in the light of the uncertainty as to where the  decision
        of the Court of Appeal in LS has left the guidance, it will be  for
        serious consideration as to whether this should be considered as  a
        potential Country Guidance case.  We make those  comments  for  the
        benefit of those who will  have  decide  such  matters  within  the
        Tribunal.  If it is to proceed as a Country Guidance case  it  will
        be listed for mention for directions.

                    EVIDENCE OF MISS MARJORIE FARQUHARSON


Miss Farquharson provided two reports, the initial report dated 12 May  2010
and an addendum dated  20  February  2011  which  was  added  following  the
discovery of the appellant's passport,  previously  believed  to  have  been
lost, and with the benefit of examination of that passport.

First Report: 12 May 2010

In her initial report, Miss Farquharson confirmed  her  instructions,  which
were to give an opinion on three matters:

 . The current situation - de jure and de facto - of failed  asylum  seekers
   returning to Uzbekistan upon expiry of their exit permits,  taking  as  a
   starting point relevant passages of OM (Returning  citizens,  minorities,
   religion) Uzbekistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00045

 . The risks, if any, facing those who return  upon  expiry  of  their  exit
   permit and are charged with in connection with these criminal offences in
   police custody

 . In the light of these answers, to assess what risk,  if  any,  would  the
   appellant face if she were to return to Uzbekistan as  a  failed  asylum-
   seeker with an exit permit from Uzbekistan that expired in March 2009.

Miss Farquharson based her conclusions on the following points:

 . The appellant had not registered herself or the birth of her  child  with
   the Uzbekistan Consulate in London

 . The appellant's passport was not available and  she  had  therefore  been
   unable to check if  the  appellant  had  permanent  registration  at  her
   parents' address in Uzbekistan or to check the stamp of the Department of
   Internal Affairs that registered it.

The passport and exit permit system in Uzbekistan

Miss Farquharson pointed out an error in the case of  OM,  in  that  it  was
stated in that case  that  all  Uzbek  passports  expired  when  the  holder
reached 21 and that Uzbek Embassies abroad issued new passports  only  on  a
discretionary  basis.  In  fact,  since  1992  the  renewal  age  for  Uzbek
passports was 25 and 45 years. Further, whilst  Uzbek  Embassies  may  issue
some replacement passports on a  discretionary  basis,  there  were  general
rules for their issue. At the time the appellant acquired  her  passport  in
February 2004 the laws regulating passport issue in Uzbekistan were the  Law
of the Republic of Uzbekistan "On Citizenship of Uzbekistan"  dated  2  July
1992 and a Presidential Decree "On Perfecting the Passport  System",  No  UP
2240, dated 26 February 1999, with two  Appendices,  Appendix  1  regulating
procedures for registering and de-registering residency on the territory  of
Uzbekistan, and Appendix 2 regulating the rights to  residency.  These  were
updated and amended on 4 June 2004.

Passports  were  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  and  were
obligatory for all citizens over the age of 16. They  were  valid  for  nine
years until the age of 25 years and, on renewal, were then valid  until  the
age of 45. On renewal at the age of 45, they were  valid  until  the  bearer
died. Passports included  records  of  marriage  or  divorce  and  under-age
children in the citizen's care and also  included  details  of  the  address
where the citizen was permanently registered in Uzbekistan.

Government regulations permitted some travel abroad  but  those  regulations
appeared to have been applied more restrictively since 2006,  following  the
demonstrations and problems in Andijan in 2005. Permission to travel  abroad
had to be applied for, according to  the  "Procedure  for  Citizens  of  the
Republic of Uzbekistan to Cross the Border", established by the  Cabinet  of
Ministers. Certain categories of people were ineligible  for  travel  abroad
and the Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  was  appraised  of  lists  of  those
citizens.

To travel abroad, an Uzbek citizen  had  to  have  permission  and  an  exit
permit for their destination  country.  The  applicant  would  submit  their
passport  and  a  completed  questionnaire  to  their  local  Department  of
Internal  Affairs  which,  within  15  days,  returned  it  with  a  sticker
authorising travel that was valid for two years. Throughout  the  two  years
of their authorised travel, Uzbek passport bearers could  freely  leave  and
enter Uzbekistan. The Ministry of Internal Affairs notified  the  Uzbekistan
Consulate in the traveller's destination  state,  which  then  recorded  the
citizen's date of entry.

Penalties for Uzbek citizens  who  violate  the  passport  and  exit  permit
system

Citizens who violated these procedures were  punishable  for  "illegal  exit
abroad" under Article 223 of the Uzbek Criminal Code.  Regulation  of  Uzbek
citizens  travelling  abroad  had  become  tighter  since  2006  and  Uzbeks
studying abroad were one group that had experienced that  tightening.  Since
2006 numerous Uzbek students were unable to complete their  courses  because
they were forbidden to leave the country under  threat  of  prosecution  for
"illegal; exit abroad". The Le Mans-based "Association for Human  Rights  in
Central Asia" reported that students and labour migrants were now unable  to
renew their permits as previously, in their  nearest  Uzbekistan  Consulate,
and were required to do  it  in  Uzbekistan,  at  the  local  Department  of
Internal  Affairs  which  gave  them  their  original  documentation.   Miss
Farquharson gave an example of one student,  studying  in  France,  who  was
prosecuted under Article 223 in 2007 for failure to do this,  together  with
examples of other Uzbeks returning to Uzbekistan from  the  Commonwealth  of
Independent States (CIS) and facing prosecution  for  illegal  exit  abroad.
Contrary to the findings in OM, therefore, there were examples of the  Uzbek
authorities punishing citizens who tried to renew their exit  permits  while
they were abroad.

In response to the question of the risks faced by anyone in  police  custody
on a charge related to the expiry of their  exit  permit,  Miss  Farquharson
gave examples of ill-treatment faced by two  women.  Miss  Farquharson  also
dealt with the possible risks to the appellant in relation to  her  fear  of
persecution by her husband, but that is not a matter being pursued  at  this
stage.

Risks faced by the appellant from the authorities

Miss Farquharson noted that the appellant differed from the  people  in  the
examples she had given, since those other cases involved  people  associated
with the events in Andijan in 2005 or suspected Islamist militants  and  the
student studying on an expired exit permit in France, albeit the closest  to
the appellant's circumstances, was known to �migr� human rights circles  and
reported closely by them.

Any risk to the appellant hung on whether her exit permit was legal  and  if
she returned to Uzbekistan as a failed asylum seeker. According to  Annex  1
of the 1995 Resolution of the  Council  of  Ministers  No  8,  no  penalties
applied to someone who returned to Uzbekistan after their  exit  permit  had
expired. An exit permit was issued only to confirm the  right  of  an  Uzbek
citizen to  leave  the  country  within  a  specified  time.  Therefore  the
legality of the appellant's exit permit was important.  In  the  absence  of
legible stamps in the photocopy of the passport, and in the absence  of  the
original passport, Miss Farquharson was unable to form a view  on  any  risk
to the appellant  of  prosecution  for  illegal  exit  abroad.  However  she
commented that the written template of the exit permit seemed  regular.  The
appellant's  return  to  Uzbekistan  as  a  failed  asylum  seeker  or   any
application to re-document the appellant, could make her liable to the  same
treatment as the individuals in the examples she had given.

Addendum:  20 February 2011

Having  had  the  benefit  of  viewing  the   appellant's   passport,   Miss
Farquharson concluded  that  the  passport  may  not  be  fully  valid.  The
passport conformed to the Uzbek  international  passport  design.  The  exit
permit at page  12  of  the  passport  was  appropriately  stamped  and  was
authentic.  However  the  template  on  page  8  was  dubious,   since   the
rectangular stamp had not been counter-stamped  by  a  round,  double-rimmed
stamp in  the  Uzbek  language  by  the  Visa  Department  of  the  Regional
department of Internal Affairs and did not  have  a  computerised  watermark
saying "Propisan" ("registered"), as in other Uzbek passports she had seen.

Implications if the appellant is returned to Uzbekistan

Miss Farquharson did not think that the  appellant  would  automatically  be
liable for "Illegal Exit Abroad and Illegal re-Entry"  under  the  terms  of
Article 223 of the Criminal Code, in view of Annex 1 of the 1995  Resolution
of the Council of Ministers No 8. The loss of her passport  would  give  her
grounds to justify the delay in returning to Uzbekistan. If her propiska  in
Uzbekistan was inauthentic, she could technically be liable for  holding  an
invalid passport. However any possible anomaly could be resolved  simply  by
the appellant and her child using their entitlement to  permanent  residency
and registration at her parents' home. Her permit to travel abroad  appeared
to be authentic and she may not risk the reprisals faced by the  individuals
in the examples cited.

Oral Evidence

Miss Farquharson said that she noted that the appellant had  not  registered
herself with the Uzbekistan Consulate  in  the  United  Kingdom,  which  was
normal procedure and was required  by  law.  She  had  been  struck  by  how
relaxed the appellant was  about  that  and  therefore  wanted  to  see  the
passport again to  make  sure  that  her  propiska/registration  was  valid.
Having seen the passport again  that  morning,  she  had  doubts  about  the
validity of the registration, since the confirmatory stamp was missing.  She
was also concerned by the fact that the sticker, that was given in order  to
exit the country, was not on the  passport.  It  should  have  been  on  the
outside of the  passport,  although  it  could  have  come  off  whilst  the
passport was with the UKBA. Her view, based  on  informed  speculation,  was
that the passport was not genuine. The appellant must have  paid  the  right
people in order to obtain a passport that was so convincing and  with  which
she had managed  to  get  a  student  visa,  and  she  therefore  must  have
connections which she could use  on  her  return  to  Uzbekistan  by  paying
again. She must have a propiska in order to live in Uzbekistan and  it  must
therefore be in another document.

If she had a genuine document which she then lost,  she  would  be  able  to
replace it at the Consulate here. She would have  had  to  report  the  loss
within 15 days and follow the required procedures to obtain a new  passport.
However she had not reported her passport lost on  the  two  occasions  when
she believed that it was lost. That could be a problem when she  went  back,
in particular if it was  a  sign  of  having  claimed  asylum  and  of  UKBA
involvement. It was a privilege and not a right to leave Uzbekistan, and  it
was not permitted to  make  any  adverse  remarks  about  the  country.  The
tightening of the regulations in 2006 occurred at the  end  of  the  Andijan
massacres and any refugees returning to Uzbekistan  who  had  been  involved
were arrested on return. Student and labour migrant were previously able  to
renew their exit permits at local Consulates. However  after  2006  the  law
was restricted and in certain cases they had to return  home  to  renew  the
visas. Miss Farquharson said that she did not know what  the  situation  was
in 2012. She was aware of the Association of Human Rights  in  Central  Asia
and she had quoted them in her report as a useful source of information.

When cross-examined by  Mr  Deller,  Miss  Farquharson  said  that  she  had
researched the legislation on exit and entry to Uzbekistan in May 2011,  for
the UNHCR, and her research was published. She  was  up  to  date  with  the
format of documentation in 2010 when she wrote her report, although she  was
not up to date at the current time. The missing sticker should have been  on
the cover of the appellant's passport. She had the same concerns  about  the
appellant's passport as she did when she wrote the addendum  to  her  report
and was concerned about the propiska, although the exit permit seemed  fine.
The passport itself appeared to be real but some bits that had  been  filled
in were  not  genuine.  If  the  appellant  were  deported  by  the  British
government, that would give her a profile and having a  false  document  may
or may not be counted against her.

When asked to clarify her opinion about the exit  permit,  Miss  Farquharson
said that she did not find anything that concerned her about the exit  visa,
other than the fact that it would  have  been  issued  by  the  Ministry  of
Internal Affairs and yet there was no such contribution  from  the  Ministry
in the propiska.




                                 APPENDIX D

                       EVIDENCE OF MR ROBERT CHENCINER


First Report:  14 June 2012

Mr Chenciner's report,  for  the  most  part,  relates  to  the  appellant's
individual claim with respect to her fear  of  her  husband  and  her  later
claim to have become a Jehovah's Witness, and is thus  of  no  relevance  to
the issues before  us.  However,  insofar  as  his  report  relates  to  the
relevant issues, it can be summarised as follows.

Insulting the President by claiming asylum

 . Articles 139 and 140 of the Criminal  Code  criminalise  denigration  and
   insulting of the President.
 . Public insult of the President is a crime punishable by up to five  years
   in prison.
 . Applying for asylum in front of a court which involves criticism of human
   rights in the state is likely to be  seen  as  a  public  insult  of  the
   President.
 . Journalists and human rights activist are  more  likely  to  be  reported
   about than other victims.
 . Following reports that if Uzbek Alisker Khakimjanov  were  returned  from
   the United Kingdom he would be imprisoned for  claiming  asylum,  he  was
   granted asylum in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2010.

Treatment on Arrival

 . If the appellant arrived by or via a United Kingdom carrier with  a  one-
   way ticket and an out-of-date visa, on her own with  a  baby,  she  would
   likely be detained and violently interrogated at the airport.  When  they
   found out that she had claimed asylum, she would  be  at  risk  of  being
   charged with insulting the President and of being abroad after her  Uzbek
   travel document had expired.

Addendum: 3 July 2012

Commenting on Miss Farquharson's view, in the addendum to her  report,  that
there were problems with the propiska stamp in the appellant's passport,  in
that it should have been over-stamped with a circular  stamp,  Mr  Chenciner
said that the Google image for Russian internal passports did not  show  the
rectangular registration stamps as being  over-stamped.  He  suggested  that
Miss Farquharson was referring to more  up-to-date  bureaucratic  procedures
whereby their methods had changed and that in 2004 they would not  have  had
the computerised watermark that she had mentioned. He  therefore  considered
the stamp to be valid. He had noted that the registration  stamp  was  back-
dated to 1995 whilst the passport was  issued  in  2004  and  had  therefore
consulted Hamid Ismailov (referred to in his previous report  as  the  heard
of BBC Central Asian & Caucasus World Service) about  this  and  whether  it
was okay for the registration stamp to be backdated to the original date  of
registration. The response had  been  that  it  was,  but  that  the  common
practice was to put a stamp with  the  date  of  issuing  the  new  document
rather than backdating it to the time the  propiska  began.  Mr  Chenciner's
conclusion was that  a  bureaucratic  error  had  been  made  in  provincial
Samarkand.

Mr Chenciner commented on the fake United Kingdom residence  permit  in  the
appellant's passport, which she claimed had  been  obtained  for  her  by  a
friend, and considered that the Home Office would most likely want to  stamp
it 'not valid', which would then bring it to  the  attention  of  the  Uzbek
border police.

Oral Evidence

Mr Chenciner produced an email from Blakemores  Solicitors  which  contained
the UKBA's response to their enquiries  about  the  number  of  removals  to
Uzbekistan, as follows:

 . In 2009 there were 127 removals, 7 of which were asylum  removals,  2  of
   which were AVR (Assisted Voluntary Return)
 . In 2010 there were 250 removals, 10 of which were asylum removals,  2  of
   which were AVR
 . In 2011 there were 228 removals, 14 of which were asylum removals,  2  of
   which were AVR

When asked for his views on  the  appellant's  passport,  he  said  that  it
appeared  to  be  a  genuine  passport,   although   some   parts   required
clarification. Having only just had the  benefit  of  viewing  the  original
passport, he had noted the registration stamp  on  page  8,  which  was  the
propiska. The word "Samarkand" could be seen in the stamp. The date in  1995
was when the appellant would have turned 18, which seemed unusual  when  the
passport was issued in 2004. However he did not believe that that  indicated
that the stamp was a forgery, but simply that someone had  made  a  mistake.
On the previous  day,  Mr  Chenciner  had  checked  with  his  friend  Hamid
Ismailov, who had consulted his contacts in Uzbekistan and had been  advised
that it was odd, since the date of issue  of  the  passport  would  normally
have been given. It seemed, however, that  it  was  just  an  administrative
error. The electronic registration referred to by  Miss  Farquharson  was  a
subsequent method used and whilst Tashkent  was  up-to-date,  Samarkand  was
not and mistakes were often made there. The passport was issued  before  the
new practice and there were no circular stamps at that time. He had  Googled
Russian propiskas by way of comparison, as Uzbek  propiskas  were  based  on
the same system, set up before the dissolution of  the  USSR.  However,  the
Uzbek authorities would know that the United  Kingdom  residence  permit  in
the appellant's  passport  was  fake  and  that  would  lead  to  her  being
detained.

In response to our enquiry as to which circumstances would lead  to  a  fine
and which would lead to imprisonment on return to Uzbekistan,  Mr  Chenciner
said that that was explained in the December 2009 letter from the Foreign  &
Commonwealth Office in the respondent's  appeal  bundle.  In  spite  of  the
regulations,  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  had  a  huge  amount  of
discretion. If a fine was incurred on return to Uzbekistan, that would be  a
lot of money for a local person.

Mr Chenciner said that any person who had claimed  asylum  was  at  risk  of
being detained and ill-treated. An asylum seeker  may  be  noticed  as  such
because they would have a one-way ticket and would be  escorted.  Under  the
old Soviet system, a list of passengers would be  sent  in  advance  of  the
aeroplane  taking  off.  There  were  penalties  for  people  insulting  the
President and those  included  imprisonment.  Any  detention  would  involve
violent questioning. The authorities would also be alerted  to  the  absence
of the child's father. The appellant could apply to  extend  her  exit  visa
and to have her child registered in her passport at  the  Consulate  in  the
United Kingdom.  That  would  not  in  itself  put  her  at  risk  with  the
authorities, since her child was born here and there was  therefore  nothing
untoward about that. However that would lead to her  husband  being  alerted
as he would have bribed the Samarkand authorities for news of his  wife.  If
the appellant applied to extend her exit visa, however, she  would  need  to
explain why she had not done so  earlier  and  if  she  explained  that  her
passport had been lost, that would lead  to  questions  which  would  reveal
that she had instructed solicitors and that  she  had  claimed  asylum.  The
Consulate here would contact the authorities in Samarkand.

When asked about the cases he had  referred  to  in  his  report  of  people
deported to Uzbekistan, Mr Chenciner said that he had not been able to  find
out any reports from the Home Office as to what happened to people  forcibly
returned to Uzbekistan.

In response to Mr Deller's enquiry  under  cross-examination,  Mr  Chenciner
agreed that association with the Andijan massacres was  a  trigger  for  the
Uzbek authorities to treat people differently, but said that it was not  the
only one. Being known  as  an  Islamist  was  another.  However,  the  Uzbek
authorities looked out for everyone returning to  Uzbekistan  as  it  was  a
police state, and they were very conscious  of  their  image  in  the  west.
Anyone applying for asylum was in a position  to  be  considered  as  having
insulted Uzbekistan, even if the claim was of a  domestic  nature,  as  that
would be a complaint about the state not taking any  action.  Merely  coming
from Samarkand was not a basis for alerting the authorities, as it would  be
for someone from Andijan.
                                 APPENDIX E

                   EVIDENCE OF ASYLUM RESEARCH CONSULTANCY


This report, dated 25 June 2012, runs to some 695 pages and  is  a  response
to the following research questions:

    . Current situation of failed asylum-seekers returning to Uzbekistan
      upon expiry of their exit permits
    . The risks, if any, facing those who return upon expiry of their exit
      permit and are charged in connection with these criminal offences in
      police custody
    . The risk, if any, the appellant would face on return to Uzbekistan as
      a failed asylum-seeker with an exit permit from Uzbekistan that
      expired in March 2009 and with a young child born out of wedlock.

The report draws together information taken  from  various  sources,  citing
relevant extracts from those sources, but without actually  seeking  to  set
out any conclusions itself. The majority of the report  consists  of  copies
of the various  human  rights  reports  and  news  items  extracted  in  the
summary.

Treatment and situation of  returned  refused  asylum  seekers  (1.  Current
situation of failed asylum seekers returning to Uzbekistan  upon  expiry  of
their exit permits)

The report commences by stating that  limited  information  documenting  the
treatment of returned asylum seekers to Uzbekistan was found  and  only  one
case was documented where someone forcibly removed was subsequently  charged
with illegally entering and exiting the country. It then  goes  on  to  cite
cases of returnees who had been detained upon return to Uzbekistan.

Law and implementation: Exit permit regime (1. Current situation  of  failed
asylum seekers returning to Uzbekistan upon expiry of  their  exit  permits;
2. The risks, if any, facing those who return  upon  expiry  of  their  exit
permit and are charged in connection with these criminal offences in  police
custody)

The report quotes from the Uzbek-German Forum  for  Human  Rights,  February
2010 as stating:
"a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, in accordance  with  the  laws  of
the Republic of Uzbekistan,  has  the  right  to  freely  travel  abroad  on
private or public affairs,  for  permanent  residence,  as  a  tourist,  for
study, for work, for medical treatment, or for business.  But  at  the  same
time, citizens wishing to go abroad are required to obtain  a  permit  which
is only valid for a period of two years. The permit is issued  in  the  form
of a sticker pasted into the citizenship passport of the applicant,  similar
to an entry visa. It is commonly called an "exit visa," which is a term  and
practice inherited from the Soviet era".

The report goes on to refer to  the  Uzbek-German  Forum  for  Human  Rights
being aware of at least two cases in which  citizens  "returning  from  long
stays abroad, found themselves under criminal prosecution because of  delays
on their exit visa upon their arrival to their homeland" and to  reports  by
Amnesty International of other such cases.

Situation and treatment in prison/police custody  (2.  The  risks,  if  any,
facing those who return upon expiry of their exit permit and are charged  in
connection with these criminal offences in police custody)

The report refers to various human rights reports, including the 2011  Human
Rights Watch annual report on  Uzbekistan,  Human  Rights  Watch  report  of
December 2011, Freedom House annual reports dated 18 May  2012  and  1  June
2011, the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office  annual  report  dated  30  April
2012, Amnesty International report for May 2011 and US Department  of  State
report for 8 April 2011, in regard to  their  reports  of  ill-treatment  in
detention.

Situation of a single woman with a child born out of wedlock (3.  The  risk,
if any, LM would face on return to Uzbekistan  as  a  failed  asylum  seeker
with an exit permit from Uzbekistan that expired in March 2009 with a  young
child born out of wedlock)

The report states that very limited information specific  to  the  treatment
of single mothers was found and  confirms  that  according  to  the  sources
consulted there is no evidence that women are subjected  to  punishment  for
having a child out of  wedlock  or  returning  with  a  child  born  out  of
wedlock.


                                 APPENDIX F

                        COUNTRY OF ORIGIN INFORMATION

Amnesty International

"Uzbekistan: Submission to the Human Rights Committee  96th  session,  16-31
July 2009", 28 April 2009 includes concerns about the liberty of movement  -
the right to enter one's own country in Uzbekistan:

      "Illegal exit abroad or illegal entry into  Uzbekistan,  including  by
      overstaying the permission to travel abroad or failing  to  renew  it,
      are punishable under Article 223 of the Criminal Code  with  fines  or
      with  imprisonment  from  three  to  five  years  or   in   aggravated
      circumstances by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Returned asylum seekers
      are particularly vulnerable to being charged  under  Article  223,  as
      many will not have renewed their permission to travel  abroad  (having
      applied for asylum abroad). Other Uzbek nationals have reportedly also
      fallen increasingly foul of the travel  regulations  while  they  were
      abroad, as new  regulations,  in  some  instances,  have  not  allowed
      nationals to renew their permission or exit  visas  in  their  nearest
      Uzbekistan Consulate, but rather  have  required  them  to  do  so  in
      Uzbekistan at the local Department of Internal Affairs which gave them
      their original documentation. Amnesty International has learned of  at
      least one Uzbek national who was prosecuted under Article 223  of  the
      Criminal Code for failure to do this in  2007,  two  years  after  the
      Human  Rights  Committee  recommended  that  Uzbekistan  "abolish  the
      requirement of an exit visa for its nationals".  This  individual  was
      charged with  illegal  exit  abroad  upon  return  to  Uzbekistan  and
      sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Although  later  released  from
      prison under an amnesty, the individual remains under a form of  house
      arrest and under a permanent foreign travel ban."

"Annual report 2012: Uzbekistan", 24 May 2012

      "Despite assertions by the authorities that the  practice  of  torture
      had significantly decreased, and the introduction of  new  legislation
      to improve the treatment of detainees, dozens of  reports  of  torture
      and other ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners emerged  throughout
      the year. In most cases, the authorities  failed  to  conduct  prompt,
      thorough and impartial investigations into these allegations."

Uzbekistan. A Briefing on Current Human Rights Concerns. May 2010

The report describes continuing persistent allegations of torture  or  other
ill-treatment by law enforcement officials and prison guards and  refers  to
human  rights  activists  and  journalists   being   summoned   for   police
questioning  and  placed  under  house  arrest  or  routinely  monitored  by
uniformed or plain-clothes officers. With regard  to  freedom  of  movement,
the report states that:

      "Amnesty International  has  been  particularly  concerned  about  the
      requirement that Uzbek nationals apply for and  obtain  permission  to
      travel abroad before leaving the country and that Article 223  of  the
      Criminal  Code  punishes  illegal  exit  and  entry  of  the  country,
      including return to the country after the expiry of the permission  to
      travel abroad...

      Illegal exit abroad or illegal entry  into  Uzbekistan,  including  by
      overstaying the permission to travel abroad or failing  to  renew  it,
      are punishable under Article 223 of the Criminal Code  with  fines  or
      with  imprisonment  from  three  to  five  years  or,  in   aggravated
      circumstances, by up  to  10  years'  imprisonment.  Returned  asylum-
      seekers are particularly vulnerable to  being  charged  under  Article
      223, as many will not have renewed their permission to travel  abroad.
      Other Uzbek nationals have reportedly also fallen increasingly foul of
      the travel regulations while they were abroad, as new regulations,  in
      some instances, have not allowed nationals to renew  their  permission
      or exit visas in their nearest Uzbekistan Consulate, but  rather  have
      required them to do so  in  Uzbekistan  at  the  local  Department  of
      Internal Affairs which gave them their original documentation."

Australian Government Refugee Review Tribunal
Country Advice Uzbekistan 15 July 2010

This report refers to the incident of the demonstration in  Andijan  in  May
2005  and  confirms  the  ongoing  interest  by  the  Uzbek  authorities  in
individuals who were participants or mere  observers.  The  report  provides
information  on  the  exit  procedures,  including   security   checks,   in
Uzbekistan, and states that citizens intending to travel abroad  must  apply
to the office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs  and  submit  their  Uzbek
passport. The application is processed within 15 days  and,  if  successful,
the applicant receives a stamp in  their  passport  that  authorises  travel
abroad. The stamp is valid for two years, during  which  time  the  relevant
passport-holder can make multiple trips abroad without having  to  apply  to
the Ministry for authorisation.


Foreign and Commonwealth Office

FCO letter from British Embassy Tashkent to Country  Specific  Policy  Team,
Home Office, dated 14 December 2009

This letter is a response to questions raised by the UKBA  in  an  email  to
the FCO dated 27 November 2009, in which the author confirms that they  have
no reason to doubt the accuracy of the responses which were  provided  by  a
Tashkent law firm.  The  letter  confirms  that  the  exit  visa  system  is
universally enforced, pursuant  to  "Exit  Procedure  for  Citizens  of  the
Republic of Uzbekistan" approved  as  Annex  1  to  the  Resolution  of  the
Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic  of  Uzbekistan  issued  on  06.01.1995
No.8, according to which a visa is used  for  two  years.  The  Ministry  of
Internal Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan  has  overall  responsibility
for the maintenance of the passport regime,  including  keeping  records  of
all exit visas issued. Exit visas must be valid and available  for  checking
at the airport. Exit visas can be renewed at the Uzbekistan Embassy  in  the
United Kingdom and Uzbek passports can be replaced if lost  or  damaged,  or
renewed if expired at the Uzbekistan Embassy in the United Kingdom.

An exit from or an entry to Uzbekistan will  be  considered  illegal  if  an
individual does not possess any valid authorisation (visa) to  enter  or  to
leave Uzbekistan issued either by the Ministry of Internal Affairs or  by  a
respective Uzbekistan Consulate abroad. Expiry of an exit visa  upon  return
of an Uzbek citizen to Uzbekistan will not be considered illegal as an  exit
visa is issued to confirm the right to exit only. Expiry  of  an  exit  visa
before any  travel  or  while  travelling  abroad  does  not  constitute  an
administrative or  a  criminal  breach.  No  penalties  are  applicable  for
returning to Uzbekistan if the exit visa has  expired,  as  exit  visas  are
issued to confirm the right of an Uzbek citizen  to  exit  the  Republic  of
Uzbekistan within a specified period. A returnee  holding  an  expired  exit
visa must produce evidence that he/she had a valid exit visa at the time  of
leaving  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan,  in  which  case  no  penalties  are
applicable.

FCO letter from British Embassy Tashkent to Country  Specific  Policy  team,
Home Office, dated 14 December 2010

    "Article 223 of the Criminal Code deals with two  types  of  situations
    with two types of applicable criminal charges.

    The first category is a fine (appr. 10,000 USD) or imprisonment from  3
    up to 5 years, is applied with respect  to  the  following  individuals
    only:

    -individuals who have breached the order of leaving  the  territory  of
Uzbekistan,
    -individuals who have breached the order of entering the  territory  of
Uzbekistan,
    -individuals who have breached the order of passing the state border of
Uzbekistan.

    Uzbek laws do not require individuals to have a "permission  to  travel
    abroad".  Uzbek  laws  require  individuals  intending  to  leave   the
    territory of Uzbekistan to acquire a permission to leave the  territory
    of Uzbekistan. This kind of permission is given for a two  year  period
    and is applied only with respect to the right of an individual to leave
    Uzbekistan. Once an individual has left Uzbekistan he/she  is  free  to
    stay abroad for any period desired (provided that other passport regime
    regulations are satisfied). If an individual has left Uzbekistan within
    the period of validity of the permission, Article 223 will  not  apply.
    If an individual left Uzbekistan without permission it is  most  likely
    that he/she would face criminal charges upon his return  to  Uzbekistan
    under Article 223. Uzbek nationals do not  require  any  permission  to
    enter Uzbekistan.

    The second category in the form of imprisonment from 5 up to  10  years
    is applied with respect to the following individuals only:

    - state officials who were obliged to receive a special  permission  to
leave Uzbekistan, and
    - individuals  who  have  unlawfully  entered  or  left  Uzbekistan  or
    breached the order of passing the state border by means of:
    - a breakthrough;
    -previous concert;"

      "Uzbekistan's  human  rights  record  remains   appalling,   with   no
      meaningful improvements  in  2011.  Torture  remains  endemic  in  the
      criminal justice system. Authorities continue to target civil  society
      activists, opposition  members,  and  journalists,  and  to  persecute
      religious believers who worship outside strict state controls."

UNHCR

Refworld report 21 November 1996
Regulations on Entry to  and  Exit  From  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for
Foreign Citizens and Stateless Persons

This report deals to a large extent with  entry  and  exit  regulations  for
foreign citizens, but in so far as it applies to Uzbek nationals it  states,
as regards the procedure  for  issuing  exit  visas  from  the  Republic  of
Uzbekistan,  that  permanent  residents  in  the  Republic  of   Uzbekistan,
intending to go abroad, apply to bodies of internal  affairs  in  places  of
residence with  filled  in  standard  application  form  in  2  copies  with
attached passport.

US Department of State

"2011 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Uzbekistan", 24 May 2012
states in its Executive Summary:

      "Uzbekistan  is  an  authoritarian  state  with  a  constitution  that
      provides for a presidential system with separation of powers among the
      executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In  practice  President
      Islam Karimov and the centralized executive branch dominated political
      life and exercised nearly complete control over the other branches  of
      government...

      The most significant human  rights  problems  included:  instances  of
      torture and abuse of detainees  by  security  forces;  denial  of  due
      process  and  fair  trial;  and  restrictions  on  religious  freedom,
      including harassment and  imprisonment  of  religious  minority  group
      members.

      Other continuing human rights  problems  included:  incommunicado  and
      prolonged  detention;  harsh  and  sometimes  life-threatening  prison
      conditions;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention   (although   officials
      released four high-profile prisoners detained for apparently political
      reasons); restrictions on freedom  of  speech,  press,  assembly,  and
      association; governmental  restrictions  on  civil  society  activity;
      restrictions on freedom  of  movement;  violence  against  women;  and
      government-organized forced labor in  cotton  harvesting.  Authorities
      subjected  human  rights  activists,  journalists,  and   others   who
      criticized  the  government  to  harassment,  arbitrary  arrest,   and
      politically motivated prosecution and detention."

With regard to freedom of movement and foreign travel, the report comments:

      "Foreign Travel: Citizens are required to have a domicile registration
      stamp in their passport before traveling domestically or  leaving  the
      country. The government also requires citizens  and  foreign  citizens
      permanently residing in the country to obtain exit visas  for  foreign
      travel or emigration, although it generally grants the visas.

      Emigration and  Repatriation:  The  law  does  not  provide  for  dual
      citizenship. In theory, returning citizens must prove  to  authorities
      that they did not acquire foreign citizenship  while  abroad  or  face
      loss  of  citizenship.  In  practice  citizens  who   possessed   dual
      citizenship generally traveled without impediment.

      The government noted that citizens residing outside  the  country  for
      more than six months could register with the country's Consulates, and
      such registration was voluntary. Unlike in some previous years,  there
      were no reports that failure to register  rendered  citizens  residing
      abroad and children born abroad stateless."


Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights

This report was submitted by the Uzbek-German  Forum  for  Human  Rights  on
behalf of an initiative group  of  Uzbek  citizens,  which  for  six  months
studied the laws and practices of the Republic  of  Uzbekistan  relating  to
freedom of movement, as well as held  45  non-standardized  interviews  with
citizens of the country. The report was submitted to  the  98th  session  of
the Committee on Civil and Political  Rights  (CCPR).  The  purpose  of  the
report was to inform the Committee, as well as the world at large about  the
Uzbek government's adherence to statutes regarding freedom of  movement  and
choice of residence.

The report refers to the institution of "propiska", as being a creation  and
an integral part of the Soviet totalitarian regime, created on  27  December
1932. It established a unified passport system throughout the Soviet  Union.
The same law also introduced the  first  compulsory  system  of  "propiska."
"Propiska" allowed the state not only to register citizens at  their  places
of residence, but by introducing an authorization system,  placed  them  and
their movements under the strict control  of  the  state.  This  system  was
adopted and remains in place almost unchanged by the current  government  in
Uzbekistan  since  its  inception.  According   to   Article   28   of   the
Constitution, citizens of the Republic  of  Uzbekistan  have  the  right  to
freedom of movement across the territory of the Republic, to enter and  exit
from it with the exception of restrictions established by the law.  However,
at the same time, citizens wishing to go abroad are  required  to  obtain  a
permit which is only valid for a period of two years. The permit  is  issued
in the form of a  sticker  pasted  into  the  citizenship  passport  of  the
applicant, similar to an entry visa. It is commonly called an  "exit  visa,"
which is a term and practice inherited  from  the  Soviet  era.  The  report
refers to several categories of citizens who are restricted in their  rights
to travel abroad for various reasons and gives two  examples  of  women  who
were faced with criminal charges on return to Uzbekistan.

"Uzbek asylum seeker on the verge of being  deported  to  Uzbekistan  -  and
straight into prison"  -  March 2010

This article concerns Alisher Khakimjanov, a 28 year old native  of  Andijan
who came to the United Kingdom as a student in 2004 and was  in  the  United
Kingdom during the Andijan uprising and massacre in  May  2005.  His  father
was arrested  in  August  2005  on  charges  of  participating  in  the  May
demonstrations and whilst his father was in  detention  the  police  sent  a
letter to the family house ordering that Alisher come  and  speak  to  them.
His father was released in December 2005 after a large bribe  was  paid  but
the family's property was confiscated and they left Uzbekistan. The  article
claims  that,  although  Alisher  had  never  been  involved  in   political
activity, it would be extremely dangerous for him to  return  to  Uzbekistan
and that he would be suspected of anti-government activity as  a  result  of
his father's arrest and flight from the country.  The  article  states  that
the British government ought to understand that being deported after  having
claimed asylum would be taken by the government  of  Uzbekistan  as  grounds
for arrest in and of itself and it calls on the British  government  not  to
deport him.  A further post, dated 19 March  2010,  indicated  that  Alisher
Khakimjanov had succeeded in his asylum appeal.   The  posts  were  reported
by the Uzbek Democratic Party on its website.
