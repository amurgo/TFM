                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal N Manuel, promulgated on 5th December 2013.

 2. The Appellant is a Nigerian citizen, born 23rd March 1984  who  applied
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant.

 3. The application was refused on 7th May 2013, the  Respondent  making  a
    combined decision to refuse to vary leave to remain, and to remove  the
    Appellant from the United Kingdom by way of directions under section 47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (the 2006 Act).

 4. The Appellant appealed and his appeal was heard by  Judge  Manuel  (the
    judge) on 11th November 2013.  The judge dismissed the appeal under the
    Immigration Rules.

 5. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    contending that the appeal should have been allowed on the  basis  that
    the section 47 decision to remove was unlawful, relying  upon  Adamally
    and Jaferi [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC).

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Colyer who found the grounds arguable, having considered Ahmadi  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 512.

 7. Following the grant of permission to appeal  the  Respondent  lodged  a
    response pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 accepting that the judge had  erred  in  law  and  that  the
    removal decision pursuant to section 47 of the 2006 Act was unlawful.

The Hearing

 8. There was no attendance on behalf of the Appellant.  I considered  rule
    38 of the 2008 Procedure Rules, and was satisfied  that  the  Appellant
    and his representatives  had  been  notified  of  the  hearing,  and  I
    considered that it was in the interests of justice to proceed with  the
    hearing.

 9. Mr McVeety relied upon  the  rule  24  response,  contending  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set  aside,  but  re-made
    with all findings preserved, save that the section 47 removal  decision
    was unlawful.

My Conclusions

10. The judge erred by failing to determine that the  Respondent's  removal
    decision made under section 47 of the 2006 Act was  not  in  accordance
    with the law because it had been made at the same time as the  decision
    refusing leave to remain.  The Respondent's decision was  made  on  7th
    May 2013, the day before section 51 of the Crime and  Courts  Act  2013
    was introduced, which made it lawful to make the two decisions  at  the
    same time and to serve them in the same document.

11. There was no challenge to any of the other findings made by the  First-
    tier Tribunal, and those findings stand and are preserved.

12. Therefore the Appellant's appeal is dismissed because the  requirements
    of paragraph 245DD(b) of the Immigration Rules are  not  satisfied  for
    the reasons given by the First-tier Tribunal.  This is not a case where
    human rights were raised before the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
is set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The  Appellant's  appeal  is  dismissed  under  paragraph  245DD(b)  of  the
Immigration Rules.

The appeal is allowed only to the extent that the Respondent's  decision  to
remove the Appellant is not in accordance with the law,  and  that  decision
therefore remains outstanding before the Respondent.

Anonymity

There was no anonymity direction made in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   There
has been no application for anonymity, and no anonymity  order  is  made  by
the Upper Tribunal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeal has been allowed only in respect of the decision to remove  under
section 47 of the 2006 Act.  No fee  is  payable  to  appeal  a  section  47
decision and therefore no fee award is made.
