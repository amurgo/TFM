                            DECISION AND REASONS


   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Henderson promulgated on 22 May 2015,  dismissing  the  appeal  of  Mr
      Dharak Suyakant Patel against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department dated 21 March 2014  to  refuse  variation  of
      leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  and  to  issue  removal
      directions pursuant to section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
      Nationality Act 2006.


   2. The Appellant's personal details and immigration history are a  matter
      of record on file and known to the parties; they are also set  out  in
      the body of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. It is unnecessary
      to re-rehearse such matters here; I refer to any pertinent matters  as
      is incidental for the purposes of this decision.


   3. The key issue before the FtT was a narrow one.  It  is  summarised  in
      these terms at paragraph 6 of Judge Henderson's decision:

"The parties agreed the issues to be determined at the commencement  of  the
      appeal hearing. The key issue related to  the  appellant's  access  to
      funds as required under provision (d) of Table 4 of Appendix A of  the
      Immigration Rules under the Points Based System ("PBS"),  and  whether
      the appellant had provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that  he
      had access to ï¿½50,000 by providing bank letters from  banks  regulated
      by the appropriate authorities".


   4. In this context, at paragraph 11 of the decision, the Judge identified
      that the Respondent had been dissatisfied in two respects:  "the  bank
      letters [the Appellant] had supplied were from  banks  which  did  not
      appear to be regulated by the appropriate authorities. There was  also
      the issue of whether the third party declaration been  signed  by  the
      appellant". However, by the time of the appeal  Respondent  maintained
      the decision on the sole basis "that there was  insufficient  evidence
      to show that the relevant  banks  are  regulated  by  the  appropriate
      authorities" (paragraph 19).


   5. I pause to note at paragraph 7 it is recorded  that  "the  appellant's
      counsel confirmed that he was not raising any argument  under  Article
      8".


   6. The Judge addressed the core issue thus identified  at  paragraphs  22
      and 23. It is apparent that the  Appellant's  representative  conceded
      that letters from the Union Bank of India  and  the  Canara  Bank  not
      contain any information to show that they were regulated, and as  such
      the Judge concluded that the Appellant had failed to comply  with  the
      requirements of the Rules. That  effectively  disposed  of  the  mater
      under the Rules.


   7. However, the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  went  on  to  consider  the
      Respondent's so-called 'evidential flexibility' policy: see paragraphs
      24-28. For the reasons set out in those paragraphs the Judge concluded
      that the Respondent was in error in failing to have proper  regard  to
      her own policy, and in particular by failing to check the  website  of
      the Reserve Bank of India, such that the Respondent's decision was not
      in accordance with the law.




   8. Notwithstanding the finding that the decision was  not  in  accordance
      with the law, the Judge did not remit the case to the Respondent  but,
      in  purported  reliance  on  AG  and   others   (Policies;   executive
      discretions; Tribunal's powers) Kosovo [2007] UKAIT  00082  determined
      that because "I cannot be sure of the exact nature of  evidence  shown
      on RBI's website I cannot allow the  appeal"  (paragraph  29),  adding
      that the Appellant had not discharge the burden of  proving  that  the
      relevant banks were regulated (paragraph 30).


   9. In my judgement this constituted a clear misinterpretation of  AG.  As
      the Judge identified, AG supports the proposition that a Tribunal  may
      make a substantive decision in favour of an appellant where a decision
      'was not in accordance with the law' by reason of a failure to  follow
      a policy, if "the claimant can show that the terms of the  policy  and
      the facts of his case are such that there was no option  open  to  the
      decision-maker other than to grant him the remedy he seeks" (paragraph
      (4) of the headnote). However, this was to say no more than  that  the
      Tribunal need not adopt the 'default' position of remittal if  it  was
      clear that an appellant would succeed under a discretionary policy; if
      it was not so clear cut, the default position still  applies  and  the
      appeal is to be allowed to the limited extent of it being remitted  to
      be determined by the Respondent in accordance with the law.


  10. Accordingly, whilst the uncertainty identified  by  the  Judge  herein
      meant that it was not appropriate to allow the appeal outright, it did
      not follow that the appeal had to be dismissed. Moreover  it  was  not
      for the Judge to evaluate the factual circumstances as  an  aspect  of
      considering how the discretion vested in the Respondent by  virtue  of
      the evidential flexibility policy should have been  exercised  on  the
      facts of this particular case. Once it had been  identified  that  the
      decision was not in accordance with the law, and that it was  not  the
      case under the evidential flexibility policy that the Respondent would
      have had no option but  to  allow  the  Appellant's  application,  the
      appropriate course,  in  accordance  with  AG,  was  remittal  to  the
      Respondent.


  11. I find that there was an error of law in the decision  of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal, and the decision must be set aside.


  12. As acknowledged before me  by  the  representatives  of  each  of  the
      parties, the decision in the appeal can simply be remade on basis that
      the case should have been allowed to the limited  extent  that  it  be
      remitted to the Respondent because the immigration decision was not in
      accordance with the law.


Notice of Decision

  13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  contained  a  material
      error of law and is set aside.


  14. I remake the decision in the appeal. The Respondent's decision was not
      in accordance with the law and the appeal is  allowed  to  the  extent
      that the application is remitted to the  Respondent  to  determine  in
      accordance with the law.





Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal I. A. Lewis     8 May 2016






      To the Respondent
      Fee Award (This is not part of the determination)


      I have allowed the appeal, albeit on a limited  basis  such  that  the
      Appellant's application  in  effect  remains  outstanding  before  the
      Respondent. Whilst the Respondent was in error in not having regard to
      her evidential flexibility policy, the origin of the  difficulty  lies
      in   the    Appellant's    failure    to    provide    the    required
      information/evidence  in  respect  of   bank   regulation   with   his
      application. In the circumstances I make no  fee  award.  (Although  I
      have heard this appeal in my capacity as a Deputy Judge of  the  Upper
      Tribunal, I make the Fee Award decision in my capacity as a First-tier
      Tribunal Judge.)
