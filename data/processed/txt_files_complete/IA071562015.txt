                                   NOTICE


 1. By a decision promulgated on 28 September 2015 Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Cohen  allowed  the  appeal  of  the  Respondent  against  the
    decision of the Appellant (the SSHD) to refuse  him  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and to remove him  by  way
    of  directions  under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum   and
    Nationality Act 2006 as amended.

 2. On 26 February 2016 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer granted the
    SSHD permission to appeal and on 21 March the  matter  was  listed  for
    hearing on 6 April 2016.  On 21 March 2016 the Respondent's  solicitors
    advised the Tribunal that the Respondent had now  been  issued  with  a
    Residence Card under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 as amended.

 3. In the circumstances Mr Avery indicated that the SSHD agreed that there
    was no practical point in proceeding with  the  SSHD's  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal and so withdrew the appeal.

    Appeal withdrawn.
    No anonymity direction is made.
