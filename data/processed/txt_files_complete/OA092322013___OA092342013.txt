Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr G Saunders a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr A Burrett of counsel instructed by Malik and Malik
solicitors


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


   1. The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer in New Delhi ("the ECO").
      The respondents are citizens of Nepal born on 26 September 1983 and 12
      March 2003 respectively. They are mother and son ("the claimants").
      The ECO has been given permission to appeal the determination of First-
      Tier Tribunal Judge Kainth ("the FTTJ") who allowed the claimants'
      appeals against the ECO's decision of 11 March 2013 to refuse to grant
      them leave to enter the UK for settlement as the wife and son of their
      sponsor Mr Ramesh Prasad Adhikar ("the sponsor") under the provisions
      of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


   2. The ECO said that in order to meet the financial requirements of the
      Immigration Rules the sponsor needed a gross income of at least
      �22,400 per annum. After referring to the documentary evidence which
      the sponsor had submitted the ECO said that the claimant had not
      submitted the required documentation to demonstrate that he met the
      financial threshold. It was also said that the bank statements from
      NatWest bank did not adequately demonstrate his gross earnings.


   3. The claimants appealed and the FTTJ heard their appeal on 10 January
      2014. Both parties were represented and the sponsor gave evidence. The
      FTTJ found that the sponsor had established that he had an income in
      excess of the �22,400 threshold. The FTTJ allowed the appeals under
      the Immigration Rules and said that in the circumstances the
      provisions of paragraph 276ADE and other Article 8 human rights
      grounds had not been considered.


   4. The ECO applied for and was granted permission to appeal arguing that
      the FTTJ erred in law by failing to give any consideration to the
      provisions of Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules which set out
      what types of evidence were required, the periods to be covered and
      the necessary formats. Furthermore, there was a lack of clarity in the
      findings. There was no finding as to the sponsor's gross annual income
      at the date of the application.


   5. Mr Saunders relied on the grounds of appeal. Mr Burrett indicated that
      he was in no position to argue that there was no error of law and
      would be making no submissions about this. He asked that if I found
      errors of law and set aside the decision then it should be remade in
      the First-Tier Tribunal.


   6. I find that there are errors of law in the determination such that it
      should be set aside. It is sufficiently clear that the ECO refused the
      application because the claimants had not supplied the "required
      documentation". I find that the "required documentation" is the same
      as the "Specified Evidence" for family members set out in Appendix FM-
      SE to the Immigration Rules. It was not sufficient for the FTTJ to
      consider whether the evidence showed that the required financial
      threshold was achieved; that evidence had to meet the very detailed
      requirements of Appendix FM-SE. The FTTJ neither mentioned these
      requirements nor attempted to address them. Indeed, I note that in
      paragraph 7 of his witness statement dated 8 January 2014 which was
      before the FTTJ the sponsor accepted that; "I was unable to obtain all
      the specified documents to demonstrate that I met the financial
      requirements at the time of the application."


   7. I also find that the FTTJ erred in law by failing to indicate either
      at all or in sufficient detail why the claimant had established the
      required gross annual income at the date of the application.


   8. The determination is so deficient in proper consideration of the
      issues that there has been no proper hearing before the First-Tier
      Tribunal. In the circumstances I set aside the decision of the FTTJ
      and direct that it be re-made in the First-Tier Tribunal.


DIRECTIONS

   1) A hearing date has been allocated. This is 23rd July 2014 at Hatton
      Cross.

   2) The hearing is to be with all issues at large. No findings are
      preserved.

   3) Time estimate two hours.

   4) Nepalese speaking interpreter required.


   5) Not before First-Tier Tribunal Judge Kainth.
