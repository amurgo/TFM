For the Respondent:    Mr M Janjua, Janjua Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 27th April 1998.  On 10th
    February 2015 she was refused an EEA permit application as an  extended
    family member of her father-in-law, who is a Dutch national residing in
    the UK exercising treaty rights here.  He earns  an  annual  income  of
    �17,680.

 2. The claimant's husband is his son and  he  earns  �16,358.   They  live
    together as one family unit.

 3. The judge wrote as follows:

         "Although the sponsor [which should read appellant] resides in  her
         parental home in Pakistan the appellant has produced  eleven  money
         transfer receipts starting from the period 7th August 2014  to  4th
         January 2016 to a Tariq Mahmood who is the  appellant's  father  to
         meet the appellant's essential  living  needs.   The  total  amount
         transferred since August 2014 is in excess of RS280,000.  Following
         the case of Reyes and bearing in mind  a  Union  citizen  had  made
         regular payments for a significant period in order to  support  her
         in the country of origin was to prove that the descendant was in  a
         real situation of dependence.  It is irrelevant that the  appellant
         could support herself through other means.  Accordingly I find that
         the appellant  is  a  dependant  of  the  sponsor  and  accept  the
         sponsor's explanation that he and his wife  will  decide  how  much
         money to send to the appellant and they will  ask  their  son,  ZIM
         (the appellant's husband) to send that amount.  The money  transfer
         receipts demonstrate that this support has  started  following  the
         marriage of the appellant to the sponsor's son.

         I accept the appellant is not in employment and is  a  student  and
         therefore reliant upon the sponsor for her essential  needs.   This
         has been demonstrated by the regular money  transfers  albeit  they
         are in the name of the appellant's father.  However, I accept these
         are for the benefit of the appellant.

         I further accept that although ZIM is  employed  and  has  his  own
         income this is used as part of the household income.  He resides in
         his father's property rent free.  Having established  dependency  I
         find that the appellant is an extended family member of the sponsor
         and satisfies the requirements of Regulation 8 and as  such  should
         be issued with an EEA family permit under Regulation 12."

 4. On that basis he allowed the appeal.

    The Grounds of Application

 5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    it was clear that there was no dependency between the sponsor  and  his
    son.  If anything the dependency was mutual  with  both  their  incomes
    being combined and  used  for  the  whole  household.   The  claimant's
    husband's income goes into the family pot;  the  judge  seems  to  have
    established the appellant's dependency purely on  the  basis  that  the
    sponsor seemingly decides the amount to be sent to her. This is  not  a
    genuine case of dependency for essential living needs.  This is a joint
    family living arrangement of choice.  The sponsor's  son  continues  to
    reside with his father out of choice and the fact that he does so  rent
    free does not make him dependent upon  his  father  for  his  essential
    needs, especially in light of the fact that his father earns just  over
    �1,300 more than he does.  Furthermore, while  the  claimant's  husband
    may not pay rent it is clear, with his income  going  into  the  family
    pot, he is contributing to the running of the household  and  expenses.
    The judge failed to explore this appropriately.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted for the reasons stated in the  grounds
    by Judge Cruthers on 6th July 2016.  Judge Cruthers said  that  it  was
    arguable that it was not reasonably open to the judge to find that  the
    claimant was dependent on her EEA national father-in-law.

    Submissions

 7. Mr McVeety relied on his grounds.  He also produced the case of  Lim  v
    ECO Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 in which the Court of Appeal held  that
    it was not enough to show that there was financial support provided  by
    the EU citizen to the family member.  The family member must  need  the
    support in order to meet his or her basic needs.  A situation  of  real
    dependence  must  be  established.   He  asked  that  the  decision  be
    reversed.

 8. Mr Janjua submitted that the claimant's husband  was  working  legally,
    having been issued with a residence card, and contributing his earnings
    into the EU family household which was running under the  direction  of
    the EU national father.  He submitted that it would  be  discriminatory
    if the claimant was not allowed to join her husband since there was  no
    other provision within the Immigration Rules for a  person  who  has  a
    five year residence card to bring in his  wife.   Other  persons  whose
    status in the UK was temporary such as those on Tier 1 or Tier 2  visas
    were allowed to bring in their spouses.  The law was not here to divide
    families. In his submission the claimant was directly dependent on  her
    father-in-law and the decision should stand.

 9. By way of reply Mr McVeety observed that many people in the UK are  not
    in a position to meet the Immigration Rules and accordingly had to live
    with their families in the country of their spouse's nationality.

    Consideration of whether there is an Error of Law

10. At paragraph 32 of Lim Elias LJ said:

         "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the  claimant  is
         in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,  and  Reyes  now
         makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That is a simple matter
         of fact.  If he can support himself, there is no  dependency,  even
         if he is given financial material support by the EU citizen.  Those
         additional resources are not necessary to enable him  to  meet  his
         basic needs.  If, on the other hand, he cannot support himself from
         his own resources, the court will not ask why  that  is  the  case,
         save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights.  The fact  that  he
         chooses not to get a job and become self-supporting is  irrelevant.
         It follows that on the facts of this case, there was no dependency.
           The  appellant  had  the  funds  to  support  herself.   She  was
         financially independent and did not need the  additional  resources
         for the purpose of meeting her basic needs."

11. The facts here are  not  in  dispute.   The  claimant  resides  in  her
    parental home in Pakistan.  Her husband,  Zain  Iqbal  Mughal,  sent  a
    number of money  transfers  to  her  father.  The  judge  accepted  the
    evidence that the claimant's  father in  law,  Mohammed  Iqbal  Mughal,
    dictated how much  money  was  sent.   On  that  basis  he  found  that
    dependency had been established.

12. There are a number of flaws with that argument.

13. First, in order  to  succeed  in  this  appeal,  the  claimant  has  to
    establish dependency upon her father-in-law and not her  husband  since
    her husband was himself granted a residence card on the  basis  of  his
    own dependency on his father. The prima  facie  evidence  is  that  the
    money sent to the claimant  is  from  her  spouse,  who  himself  earns
    �16,358 per annum.  The fact that he puts his money into a  family  pot
    does  not  establish  that  the  monies  sent  to  her  represent  real
    dependency on the EEA sponsor.  Even if the EEA sponsor  told  his  son
    how much money to send to his wife, that does not  show  that  she  was
    directly dependent upon him, for her essential needs.

14. Second, even if there was some financial support provided  direct  from
    the EU citizen, and there is no evidence  at  all  that  there  is,  it
    cannot be established that that  support  was  in  order  to  meet  the
    claimant's basic needs. Undoubtedly she receives financial support from
    her husband - on the face of it the Western  Union  receipts  are  sent
    from him. Moreover she is living  in  a  house  owned  by  her  father,
    contrary to what was stated in the application form when  she  said  it
    was owned by the EEA national.

15. Her basic needs are being met by the provision  of  accommodation  from
    her father, and from monies sent by her husband from his earnings.

16. Finally, there is  no  unlawful  discrimination.   The  fact  that  the
    claimant cannot meet the requirements of the  EEA  Regulations  because
    she cannot establish dependency is not discriminatory.  Neither  is  it
    discriminatory that she cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules.  Many families do not.

17. No Article 8 arguments were put forward to demonstrate  any  breach  of
    the ECHR by this refusal.

Notice of Decision

The original judge erred in law and  his  decision  is  set  aside.   It  is
remade as follows.  The claimant's appeal is dismissed.
