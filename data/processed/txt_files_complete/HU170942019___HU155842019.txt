Representation:
For the Appellants:    In person (First Appellant speaking for both
Appellants)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh who were born respectively on
    28 October 1987 and 26 September  1993.   They  are  husband  and  wife
    respectively.

 2. The first appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 28  December  2008
    with entry clearance as a student and leave to  enter  valid  until  31
    July 2011.  On 1 July 2011, the first  appellant  applied  for  further
    leave as a Tier 4 General Student.  He  was  granted  leave  to  remain
    until 30 March 2012.  That leave was  subsequently  extended  until  30
    January 2016 when his leave expired.

 3. On 27 January 2016, the first appellant applied for a residence card as
    an extended family of an EEA national.  That application was refused on
    12 July 2016 and his subsequent appeal was dismissed on 30 January 2019
    and he became appeal rights exhausted on 14 February 2019.

 4. On 2 February  2019,  the  first  appellant  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain  based  upon  ten  years  lawful  continuous
    residence under para 276B of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).



 5. On 2 February 2019, the second appellant, who had entered the UK  on  2
    February 2015 as the dependent the first appellant (a Tier 4  (General)
    Student), also made an application for leave based upon her private and
    family life under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 6. The Secretary of State refused the first appellant's application  on  4
    October 2019 and the second  appellant's  application  on  5  September
    2019.

 7.  Both  appellants  appealed  to  the   First-tier   Tribunal.    In   a
    determination sent on 11  February  2020,  Judge  Bird  dismissed  both
    appellants' appeals.  The outcomes of the appellants' appeals were,  in
    effect, dependent upon each other.  First, the  judge  found  that  the
    first appellant could not  establish  the  required  10  years'  lawful
    continuous residence.  The first  appellant's  leave  commenced  on  28
    December 2018 and expired on 30 January 2016: it, therefore, fell short
    of the required 10  years'  lawful  residence.   The  judge  concluded,
    correctly, that the first appellant's application for an EEA  residence
    card, made in time, did not extend  his  leave  which  would  otherwise
    expire on 30 January 2006 under  s.3C  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.
    Secondly, the judge found that the appellants' removals  to  Bangladesh
    were not prohibited by para 276ADE(1)(vi) on the basis that it was  not
    established that there  were  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  their
    integration on return.  Finally, the judge found that  the  appellants'
    removals were not disproportionate and therefore  a  breach  of  Art  8
    outside the Rules.

 8. The appellants sought permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission was initially refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Chohan) on 13 July  2020.   However,  on  17  August  2020,  the  Upper
    Tribunal (UTJ Coker) granted the appellants permission to appeal.

 9. The appeal was listed for a hearing at the Cardiff Civil Justice Centre
    on 11 February 2020.  The court worked remotely by Skype for  Business.
    The appellants joined the hearing remotely by Skype and Mr  C  Howells,
    who represented the Secretary of State, also joined by Skype.

10. The first appellant made a number of oral submissions.  In  particular,
    he was concerned with the  fact  that,  in  the  decision  letter,  the
    respondent had refused his application, in part, because it was said he
    had fraudulently obtained a TOEIC certificate from ETS by using a proxy
    test taker.  In granting permission, UTJ Coker  emphasised  that  Judge
    Bird had not, in reaching  her  decision  to  dismiss  the  appellants'
    appeals, sufficiently  taken  into  account  the  Presenting  Officer's
    concession at the hearing that the respondent no  longer  pursued  this
    basis for the refusal.  Mr Howells confirmed, in his submissions before
    me, that the respondent did not now contend that  the  first  appellant
    had obtained his TOEIC certificate by fraudulent means.

11. Mr Howells, having heard the first  appellant's  submissions,  accepted
    that Judge Bird had erred in law in reaching her  decision  under  para
    276ADE(1)(vi).  First, he accepted that in  paras  26  and  27  of  her
    determination, she had approached the issue under para 276ADE(1)(vi) on
    the erroneous basis of enquiring  whether  there  were  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to family life continuing in Bangladesh.  This was the  test
    applicable  under  the  Rules  when  para  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM   was
    applicable.  It was not the test under  para  276ADE(1)(vi)  which  was
    "very significant obstacles" to  integration.   He  conceded  that  the
    'insurmountable obstacles' test was potentially a higher test than  the
    "very  significant  obstacles"  to  integration   set   out   in   para
    276ADE(1)(vi).  Secondly, Mr Howells agreed that the judge's assessment
    under para 276ADE(1)(vi) failed properly to take into account  all  the
    circumstances of the appellants' young son.  There was evidence  before
    the judge concerning the health of their son who was born on 3  October
    2017.  In particular, there were GP records at pages 39 and 40  of  the
    appellants' bundle.  Mr Howells pointed out that the judge had referred
    to  the  appellants'  child  as  suffering  "from  eczema"  and  having
    "breathing problems" and  asthma  at  para  25  of  her  determination.
    However, in concluding in para 29 of her determination that it  was  in
    the child's "best interests" that he "remains with  his  parents",  the
    judge made  no  reference  to  his  health  and  the  medical  evidence
    concerned with it.  Given these too points, Mr Howells  invited  me  to
    set aside the judge's decision and remit the appeal for a fresh hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

12. In the light of Mr Howells'  concession,  with  which  I  agree,  I  am
    satisfied that the judge  materially  erred  in  law  in  reaching  her
    finding  that  neither  appellant  met   the   requirements   of   para
    276ADE(1)(vi).  This is not to say that the appellants would (or  will)
    inevitably succeed   under  para  276ADE(1)(vi)  but  rather  that  the
    judge's  misdirection  and  assessment  under  para  276ADE(1)(vi),  in
    particular in relation to their son's best  interests  amounted  to  an
    error of law and I am not persuaded that the error  was  immaterial  to
    the judge's findings.

Decision

13. For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appellants' appeals under Art 8 involved the making  of  an
    error of law.  That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

14. Given the nature and extent of fact-finding required, and having regard
    to para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice  Statement,  the  proper
    disposal of these appeals is to remit them to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a de novo re-hearing before a judge other than Judge Bird.

15. In that context, Mr Howells confirmed that  the  respondent  would  not
    seek to re-open the issue of whether the first appellant  had  obtained
    his TOEIC certificate fraudulently.  The respondent accepted  that  the
    first appellant had not obtained the TOEIC certificate fraudulently.

16. The first appellant indicated that, given that he  lived  in  the  West
    Country, he would ask that  the  remitted  appeals  be  listed  at  the
    Newport Hearing Centre.  He also indicated that the appellants would be
    available for a remote/video link hearing in the current circumstances.

17. Consequently, I remit the appeals to  the  Newport  Hearing  Centre  to
    remake the decision under Art 8 of the ECHR on the above basis.

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
