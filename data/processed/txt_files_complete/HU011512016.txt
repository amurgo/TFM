Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Khan, Counsel, instructed by  KC Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Thomas (the judge), promulgated on  10  April  2017,  in
    which she dismissed the Appellant's appeal.  By an application made  on
    12 October 2015 the Appellant had sought entry clearance  to  join  his
    spouse in the United Kingdom.   The  application  was  refused  by  the
    Respondent on 4 December 2015 on the basis that the Appellant could not
    satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM in relation to the  genuineness
    of the relationship, the financial requirements, and  the  adequacy  of
    accommodation.

The Judge's decision

 2. The judge found that the Appellant's relationship with his wife was  in
    fact genuine and subsisting, and that there was adequate  accommodation
    in place.  However, she also found that the Appellant  could  not  meet
    the financial requirements under Appendix FM with reference to Appendix
    FM-SE.  Specified evidence had not been provided  at  any  stage.   The
    judge went on to look at Article 8 outside the context of the Rules but
    concluded (at least implicitly) that there were no  exceptional  and/or
    compelling circumstances in the case.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 3. The grounds assert that the judge should have looked at the evidence as
    a whole, not just the documents provided by the Appellant.  It is  said
    that the judge did not deal adequately with the fact that  the  sponsor
    had received some of her wages in cash and  that  she  had  significant
    savings.  It is also said that the judge erred in concluding  that  the
    Appellant could make a fresh application for entry  clearance.   It  is
    said that the costs involved  and  any  delay  resulting  from  another
    refusal would be disproportionate.  In granting permission,  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Gillespie noted that the application had been  two  days
    out of time.  However he regarded this delay as being minimal and there
    was sufficient merit in  the  grounds  for  time  to  be  extended  and
    permission to be granted.




The hearing before me

 4. Mr Khan was entirely realistic in respect of his submissions before me.
     He accepted that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE had not  been  met
    due  to  the  absence  of  certain  specified  evidence.   However,  he
    submitted that the judge had erred in respect of the  consideration  of
    Article 8 outside the scope of the Rules.  He suggested that  once  the
    judge found there to be a genuine and subsisting relationship he should
    then have considered whether the costs and delays  in  making  a  fresh
    application  would  have  had  a  disproportionate   impact   on   that
    relationship.  He also noted that it seems as though there was in  fact
    enough income to have met the minimum income threshold.   He  submitted
    that the judge had failed to engage adequately with the proportionality
    exercise.

 5. Mr Duffy submitted that all of the conclusions  reached  were  entirely
    open to the judge.  An individual could not obviate the  need  to  meet
    the relevant Rules when making  an  application  for  entry  clearance.
    There was nothing extra or exceptional in this case.   Mr  Duffy  noted
    that the sponsor appeared to have  ï¿½10,000  in  savings  and  this  was
    relevant to the ability to make a fresh application.

My decision on error of law

 6. As I announced to the parties at the hearing, I conclude that there are
    no material errors of law in the judge's decision.  My reasons for this
    are as follows.

 7. It was entirely open to the judge to conclude that the requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE had not been met.  It is clear that a number of relevant
    items of evidence had simply not been submitted at any stage.  Mr  Khan
    has candidly accepted this point.

 8. It was in turn open to the judge to conclude that the  Appellant  could
    not succeed in respect of the Article 8-related Rules.

 9. This in turn was clearly going to have  a  significant  impact  on  the
    judge's assessment of Article 8  outside  the  context  of  the  Rules.
    Although the judge could perhaps have expressed  herself  with  greater
    clarity in subsequent paragraphs, it is clear enough in  my  view  from
    her assessment of Article 8 outside the context of the Rules  that  she
    has taken all relevant matters into account.   She  has  accepted  that
    there was family life and noted that the Appellant had failed  to  meet
    the requirements of the Rules.  Although not expressly  stated,  it  is
    implicit in her decision (and clear from the current state of the law),
    that a failure to meet the  Rules  is  relevant  to  an  assessment  of
    proportionality.  The Rules are the Rules, and they cannot be  obviated
    or circumvented unless strong reasons are put  forward.   It  is  clear
    enough from the judge's decision and the evidence that I have  seen  on
    file that there were no "exceptional", "compelling", or  "very  strong"
    reasons for the Article 8 claim to succeed once the Rules could not  be
    met.  There were  no  health  issues,  children,  or  other  particular
    circumstances existing in this case.  On  the  face  of  it  there  was
    nothing preventing the making of a fresh application.   The  conclusion
    that such an application could be made was one to which the  judge  was
    entitled to come to.

10. There are no errors and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  shall
    stand.

11. It is open to  the  Appellant  to  make  a  fresh  application  in  the
    knowledge that the judge has found that his relationship with his  wife
    is genuine and subsisting and that adequate accommodation would  be  in
    place.  Those two findings would be favourable to a future application.
     I also note the existence of substantial savings  on  the  Appellant's
    wife's part.  These two could be utilised in  the  making  of  a  fresh
    application.
