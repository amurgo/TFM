Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr N Ohanugo, instructed by Moorhouse Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Agnes Karieren, date of birth 25.11.71, is a citizen  of
    Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Frankish promulgated 27.11.14, dismissing her appeal against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse her application for  leave
    to remain in the UK on the basis of private and family life. The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 12.11.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison refused permission to  appeal
    on 23.1.15, but when the application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal,
    on 6.5.15 Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge   Saini  granted  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 30.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I found no material error of law in the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Frankish to be set aside.

 6. Judge Frankish found that the appellant did not meet  the  relationship
    requirements of Appendix FM, because she is an overstaying  visit  visa
    entrant to the UK, as set out at E-LTRP 2.1. Neither, in  the  view  of
    Judge Frankish, did the appellant meet the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE in respect of private life. Curiously, the judge then went  back
    to consider EX1 of Appendix FM, which I have addressed below.

 7. As noted by the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant had in fact obtained
    entry to the UK by deception, lying  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    about her circumstances and intentions. Once in the UK  she  assumed  a
    false identity and went to work illegally. Whilst present illegally she
    met the sponsor in 2008 and married in 2013.

 8. At both the First-tier Tribunal and in his submissions  before  me,  Mr
    Ohanugo relied on two main features: the terminal and deteriorating ill-
    health of the sponsor, who was diagnosed with malignant prostate cancer
    in August 2013. It is said that the appellant  provides  him  essential
    care.   Secondly,  in  relation  to  the  issues  as  to  whether   the
    appellant's removal would be disproportionate and whether it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the appellant and the sponsor to continue family
    life outside the UK, reliance is placed on the  sponsor's  relationship
    with his daughter, a British citizen residing in Glasgow, Scotland.

 9. As Judge Saini pointed out in the  decision  granting  permission,  the
    grounds make pro forma, broad and unimpressive references to the  facts
    of the appeal, which are unhelpful to  the  appellant.  However,  Judge
    Saini identified what was considered to be an arguable error of law  in
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge's consideration of EX1 and the  issue  of
    insurmountable obstacles

10. I note that there are some errors in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that are not material to the outcome of the appeal.

11. First, if the appellant cannot meet the immigration status  requirement
    of E-LTRP 2.1, there can be no consideration of EX1, as the application
    and appeal has fallen at a previous, threshold, requirement. It is  not
    clear to me why, having decided at �25 that  the  appellant  could  not
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM as a partner and at �26 she  could
    not meet the requirements of Appendix FM as a parent, the judge went on
    at �31 to consider EX1(a) and  (b)  and  the  issue  of  insurmountable
    obstacles. The judge found that the sponsor was but a distant figure in
    the child's life and that there was little evidence of contact  between
    them and thus that EX1(a) is not engaged. The judge  then  went  on  to
    consider EX1(b) in relation to family life with  the  sponsor,  who  is
    settled in the UK, concluding that she did not meet EX1(b)  as  defined
    by EX2.

12. A second non-material error appears at �34 the judge relied on  section
    117B of the 2002 Act when assessing whether the appellant could succeed
    under EX1, as defined by  EX2.  As  confirmed  by  Bossade  (ss.117A-D-
    interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415  (IAC),  in  which  the
    Upper Tribunal held that for courts  and  tribunals,  the  coming  into
    force of Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    (ss.117A-D) has not altered  the  need  for  a  two-stage  approach  to
    Article 8 claims. However, "ordinarily a court or tribunal will,  as  a
    first stage, consider an appellant's Article 8 claim  by  reference  to
    the Immigration Rules that set out substantive conditions, without  any
    direct reference to Part 5A considerations. Such considerations have no
    direct application to rules of this kind. Part 5A  considerations  only
    have direct application at the second stage of the Article 8  analysis.
    This method of approach does not amount to according  priority  to  the
    Rules  over  primary  legislation  but  rather  of  recognising   their
    different functions."

13. However, neither of the above issues are material to the outcome of the
    appeal.

14. Although it was not raised in the grounds of application for permission
    to appeal, the grant of permission claims an arguable material error of
    law in that the consideration of EX1(b) because  the  judge  failed  to
    take into account findings and observations  concerning  the  sponsor's
    deteriorating health in light of his worsening prostate cancer and  the
    implications of this upon his relocation. It is also suggested that "in
    reaching findings on insurmountable obstacles the judge failed to  take
    into account the most recent letter concerning the deterioration of the
    sponsor's  health  and  the  spread  of  cancer  throughout  his  body,
    preferring instead an older  letter  when  the  sponsor's  health  with
    clearly better than it has become."

15. First, given that EX1(b) was not available to the appellant as she  did
    not meet the requirements of E-LTRP2.1, the  claimed  error  cannot  be
    material. Second, it is quite apparent from a reading of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal that the judge did take both medical letters
    into consideration. The first letter, dated 20.8.13, is  summarised  at
    �14, and the second letter, dated 3.3.14,  is  summarised  at  �15.  Dr
    Leitch expressed the view that if he returned to Nigeria  he  would  be
    able to receive similar treatment on a private  basis  to  that  he  is
    receiving in the UK, and that it would be relatively inexpensive.  Both
    letters are also referenced in the judge's findings at �33.

16. In the circumstances, there is no merit in this ground of appeal.

17. The second issue relied on  is  the  sponsor's  relationship  with  his
    daughter. This is addressed in detail at �29 of the First-tier Tribunal
    decision. The judge noted that the  only  evidence  of  contact  was  a
    single rail ticket to Glasgow, where the daughter lives, from  Chester,
    where the sponsor lives. The judge also noted that in  his  unfortunate
    and terminal ill-health the sponsor is unable to travel far. The  judge
    concluded that the sponsor was, "a distant figure who has had little to
    do with his daughter since her birth and with  the  best  will  in  the
    world, his contact  is  now  even  more  constrained  by  his  terminal
    illness." The judge did not accept that her medical condition required,
    as claimed, long and frequent staying visits by him to be by her  side.
    At �32 the judge accepted that in all probability the contact was  more
    frequent  than  the  one  train  ticket  demonstrated,  but  concluded,
    "Nontheless that does not amount to the appellant  having  developed  a
    parental relationship with 'E' in any shape or form, she having her own
    mother with whom she lives in Glasgow." The judge thus found  that  the
    relationship did not engage EX1(a), although it has to be borne in mind
    that it is the appellant and not the sponsor who  would  have  to  meet
    EX1(a), even if this provision were applicable. Mr Ohanugo confirmed in
    the hearing before me that there was no  further  evidence  of  contact
    between the sponsor and the child. In the circumstances,  I  find  that
    there is no error of law in the judge's  assessment  of  the  sponsor's
    contact or relationship with his daughter. The findings and conclusions
    of the judge were open on the rather limited  evidence  and  for  which
    cogent reasons have been given. These findings cannot be  described  as
    either irrational or perverse. In the circumstances there is  no  merit
    in this ground of appeal and I find no material error of law in respect
    of the same.

18. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Saini also considered there was
    a further arguable error of law in the judge's reliance on Gulshan  and
    that the judge  had  applied  an  incorrect  standard  of  "exceptional
    circumstances," in refusing to consider article 8  outside  the  Rules.
    However, following Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ  74,  and  SSHD  v  SS
    (Congo) & Ors [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387,  it  is  clear  that  whilst  the
    assessment of Article 8 claims requires a two-stage analysis, and there
    is no threshold or intermediary requirement  of  arguability  before  a
    decision maker moves to consider the second stage, whether that  second
    stage is required will depend on  whether  all  the  issues  have  been
    adequately addressed under the Rules. In other words, there is no  need
    to conduct a full separate examination of article 8 outside  the  Rules
    where in the circumstances of a particular case, all issues  have  been
    addressed in the consideration under the Rules. Leave to remain outside
    the Rules on the basis of family life (where no children are  involved)
    established in the UK at a time when the presence of one  or  other  of
    the  partners  was  known  to  be  precarious,  does  require,  if  not
    exceptional circumstances, certainly compelling circumstances. In  this
    case, although it appears to have been unnecessary, there  was  a  very
    full consideration of EX1 and the issue of insurmountable obstacles. In
    the circumstances, all the  factors  that  would  be  relevant  to  any
    article 8 consideration have already been considered by the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge. In the circumstances, there is no merit in this  ground
    of appeal.

Conclusions:

19. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
