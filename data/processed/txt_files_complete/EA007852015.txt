For the Appellant:     Ms K Anifowoshe, of Counsel, instructed by Elkettas
                 & Associates Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria born  on  8th  July  1991.  He
       entered the UK as a visitor and overstayed.  He  made  a  claim  for
       asylum which was unsuccessful, and then two applications for an  EEA
       residence card as an extended dependent family member  which  failed
       as he could show no past dependency in his country of origin on  his
       EEA sponsor, Mrs Karima Cherid. He returned to Algeria in 2015.

    2. On return to Algeria in 2015 he applied for a  family  permit  under
       Regulations 8 and 12 of the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006  as  an
       extended family member to join his sister-in-law, Mrs Karima Cherid,
       an Italian citizen in the UK who is married to his brother Mr Faouzi
       Alem. His application was refused by the respondent  on  6th  August
       2015. His appeal against the decision was  dismissed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Beach in a decision promulgated on the 9th June  2017
       on the basis that there was no valid appeal before her.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted and time extended by Judge  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal Andrew on 22nd November 2017 on the  basis  that
       it was arguable that the  First-tier  judge  had  erred  in  law  in
       finding that there was no valid appeal in light of the  decision  in
       Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. The hearing of the appeal  was  adjourned
       in January 2018 pending the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in
       SM (Algeria) v Entry Clearance Officer [2018] UKSC 9.

    4. The matter came  before  us  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    5. The appellant submits that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  by
       relying upon the case of Sala which was overturned by the  Court  of
       Appeal in the case  of  Khan.  This  position  is  accepted  by  the
       respondent in the light of the decision in SM(Algeria).

Conclusions - Error of Law

    6. We agree that this is the case and set aside  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal.

    7. The appellant requested that the  decision  be  re-made  before  the
       Upper Tribunal so that it could be resolved promptly without further
       delay. Ms Anifowoshe took time to check her  instructions  from  her
       client on this point. We accept that this was appropriate given  the
       request made to us.

    8. Unfortunately, Mr Melvin did not have the bundle for  the  re-making
       hearing which had been provided to the respondent in  January  2018.
       We therefore adjourned the re-making hearing until  after  lunch  so
       that Mr Melvin had time to copy and read the bundle, and also review
       a small amount  of  updating  evidence  provided  by  the  appellant
       documenting the continuing exercise of Treaty rights by  Mrs  Cherid
       and also the continuation of the sending  of  �100  a  month  by  Ms
       Cherid to the appellant. On resumption  of  the  hearing  Mr  Melvin
       confirmed that he had had  sufficient  time  to  prepare.   He  also
       confirmed that he accepted that the sponsor, Mrs  Cherid,  continued
       to exercise Treaty rights in the UK as a worker in the UK.

Evidence & Submissions - Re-making

    9. Mrs Karima Cherid attended the Upper Tribunal and gave oral evidence
       through  an  Arabic  interpreter,  whom  she  confirmed  she   could
       understand. In her written and oral evidence she says,  in  summary,
       as follows. She is married to Mr Faouzi Alem  and  they  have  three
       children. She has worked continually at all  material  times,  apart
       from short  periods  when  her  children  were  born.  She  received
       maternity benefits at this time. Her husband is also in employment.

   10. The appellant is her brother-in-law. He lived with her  family  from
       2008 to 2015, and was financially dependent on her during this time.
       He did not work whilst he was  in  the  UK.  She,  her  husband  and
       children are all very attached  to  him.  He  made  applications  to
       remain with an EEA residence card whilst he was in the UK but  these
       were all refused and the appeals dismissed.

   11. In May 2015 the appellant went back to Algeria but he  has  remained
       financially dependent on her. The �100 a month  she  sends  converts
       into approximately 1500 Algerian dinars which is enough money to pay
       for  all  of  the  appellant's  food,  electricity,  gas  and  other
       expenses. In fact a family could live on this amount in Algeria.  He
       has not managed to obtain employment in Algeria despite  trying  and
       lives solely on the money she sends. It is very hard to obtain a job
       in Algeria and the appellant has no educational qualifications so he
       has tried to get jobs such as a  cleaner  or  a  guard  but  without
       success. The appellant does not get any unemployment benefit as this
       does not exist in Algeria.

   12. Since returning to Algeria the appellant has lived alone in  a  room
       provided  to  him  by  his  aunts  and  uncles   in   his   deceased
       grandfather's house. These aunts  and  uncles  do  not  provide  the
       appellant with any financial support as they have their own families
       to support. The house is in the Hussein Dey district of Algiers, and
       she confirmed the address is [4.......................]. His parents
       live between 1 and 2 hours away from him and do not provide him with
       money. His parents gave the [4...................] address when they
       applied for entry clearance to visit the UK in the past  because  it
       is the main family house and they lived there previously before  the
       appellant's grandparents passed away.

   13. The appellant's twin brother, Madani Alem, was refused an EEA family
       permit by the respondent but was successful in his  appeal  and  now
       lives with her and her family. She does not  believe  the  appellant
       should be treated differently from his brother.

   14. Mr Faouzi Alem attended the Upper Tribunal and gave  oral  evidence.
       In his written and oral evidence he says, in summary, as follows. He
       is married to  Mrs  Karima  Cherid  and  they  have  three  children
       together. The appellant is his brother. The appellant lived with his
       family from 2008 to 2015, and was financially dependent on his  wife
       during this time. The appellant did not work whilst he  was  in  the
       UK. He and his wife and the children are all very  attached  to  the
       appellant. The appellant made applications to  remain  with  an  EEA
       residence card whilst he was in the UK but these  were  refused  and
       the appeals dismissed.

   15. In May 2015 the appellant went back to Algeria but he  has  remained
       financially dependent on his wife  since  that  time.  He  lives  at
       [4..................] in Algiers where he has a  room  in  a  shared
       house left to relatives by his grandfather. He does  not  live  with
       his parents, and his parents do not support him.  His  parents  live
       about an hour's drive away. The appellant lives solely on money sent
       by his wife and is not working. He has no skills to find a  job  and
       did not work in the UK. He did study English at college in  the  UK.
       It is very hard to find a job in Algeria, and so although he is sure
       he has tried to find work he has not managed to do this.

   16. He and his wife sponsored the appellant's twin brother  Madani  Alem
       to come to the UK and he won  his  appeal  in  2014.  He  feels  the
       appellant should be treated equally with Madani. Madani continues to
       live with his family although he now has employment in the UK.

   17. Mr Melvin argues  for  the  respondent,  relying  upon  the  refusal
       notice, his skeleton argument and oral  submissions,  that  the  EEA
       sponsor sending �20 a week to the appellant in Algeria is a  cynical
       attempt to show that the EEA Regulations are met and not  indicative
       of actual dependency. In the refusal letter it is contended that the
       appellant lives with his parents who provide  accommodation  as  the
       same address was used by his parents when they  visited  the  UK  in
       October 2007, and,  that  �100  a  month  is  a  modest  amount  and
       therefore insufficient to feed and clothe the appellant, and  so  he
       must either be dependent on his parents  or  work  in  Algeria.  The
       appellant's history of prior residence in the UK  between  2008  and
       2015 during which he made three unsuccessful  applications  (asylum,
       and two residence card applications on the current basis  -  appeals
       against these refusals being  dismissed  by  a  First-tier  Tribunal
       because he had failed to show prior dependency on his  EEA  sponsor)
       showed that he would do or say anything to secure a family residence
       permit. The evidence of the sponsors should not be seen as  credible
       as it was not credible the appellant could support himself  on  that
       amount of funds and no evidence had been provided of the  break-down
       of the appellant's expenses, and also as the sponsors had  not  been
       found to be entirely credible in the previous decision of  Judge  of
       the First-tier Tribunal MPW Harris promulgated on 11th January 2013.



   18. Mr Melvin also drew our attention to Lim v Entry  Clearance  Officer
       Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383, and particularly  to  paragraph  32  of
       that decision which clarifies  that  the  question  is  whether  the
       appellant has the financial means to enable him to  meet  his  basic
       needs. If the appellant has other means, other than the  money  sent
       by Mrs Cherid,  to  support  himself  then  he  is  not  financially
       dependent.

   19. Ms Anifowoshe submits for the appellant that it is accepted  by  the
       respondent that Mrs Karima Cherid is an Italian citizen and a worker
       in the UK with a residence permit.

   20. She argues that the evidence is clear that Mrs Cherid sends  �100  a
       month to the appellant,  and  has  done  so  since  the  appellant's
       departure to Algeria in 2015, and also that it  is  clear  that  Mrs
       Cherid fully supported him financially whilst he was living in  this
       country between 2008 and 2015 in her home. She argues  that  whether
       the amount sent is modest is irrelevant. The question is whether the
       dependency is an economic fact, and it is not  relevant  whether  it
       was a dependency  of  necessity,  see  Lebon  [1987]  ECR  2811.  Ms
       Anifowoshe also relies upon EU Commission guidance which states that
       the question of dependency is, in  essence,  whether  the  appellant
       needs his UK sponsor for material  support  to  meet  his  essential
       needs in his country of origin.

   21. Ms Anifowoshe submits that the sponsors' evidence was  credible  and
       should be believed. Two  previous  First-tier  Tribunal  judges  had
       believed  the  sponsors'  evidence  that  the  appellant  had   been
       dependent on Mrs Cherid since coming to the UK.  The  appellant  has
       behaved properly in leaving the UK and applying for a family  permit
       as neither of these judges had believed he had  been  able  to  show
       dependency prior to coming to the UK. There was no  issue  of  abuse
       here. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Stokes  in  a  determination
       promulgated on 5th November 2014 had found that a payment of  �80  a
       month to the appellant's twin brother, Mr Madani Alem,  sufficed  to
       show that Madani Alem was dependent on the sponsors for his material
       needs, and thus qualified  for  a  family  permit.  The  amount  was
       therefore a credible amount to support the appellant, and even if it
       is correctly described  as  modest  this  does  not  mean  that  the
       appellant  could  not  rely  upon  it  for   his   essential   needs
       particularly as he has a free room in shared accommodation  provided
       by family which reduces his costs. It was further believable that he
       would not be able to obtain employment in Algeria given that he  had
       come to the UK as a minor and had only studied English in the UK and
       so had no transferable skills or qualifications or  work  experience
       when he returned to Algeria.

   22. Ms Anifowoshe therefore argues that the  appellant  is  entitled  to
       succeed in his appeal as he can meet the requirements of Regulations
       8 and 12 of the EEA Regulations. She  confirmed  that  she  did  not
       pursue the Article 8 ECHR arguments in her skeleton argument.

   23. Mr  Melvin  pointed  out  that  Ms  Anifowoshe's  skeleton  argument
       contained a statement that the  appellant  lived  with  his  parents
       which was at  odds  with  the  evidence  of  the  sponsors  and  her
       submissions. As this document had been written in January  2018  she
       explained she was uncertain where she had obtained this  information
       or if it was a simple error on her part, and so she was given  until
       10am on 28th March  2018  to  email  the  Upper  Tribunal  with  her
       explanation. On 28th March 2018 Ms Anifowoshe wrote apologising  and
       confirming it had been an  error  on  her  part  and  there  was  no
       corresponding evidence that she had been provided  with  to  support
       this contention.

   24. At the end of the re-making hearing we reserved our determination.

 Conclusions - Re-making

   25. The relevant provision of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 for
       this appellant who wishes to  qualify  for  a  family  permit  as  a
       dependent extended family member is as follows:




Extended family member

8.-(1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a person  who  is
not a family member of an EEA national under regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or  (c)
and who satisfies a condition in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

(2) The condition in this paragraph is that the person is-

(a)a relative of an EEA national; and

(b)residing in a country other than the  United  Kingdom  and  is  dependent
upon the EEA national or is a member of the EEA  national's  household;  and
either-

(i)is accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or wants  to  join
the EEA national in the United Kingdom; or

(ii)has joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and  continues  to  be
dependent upon the EEA national, or to be a member  of  the  EEA  national's
household.


   26. We are guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Lim v  Entry
       Clearance Officer Manila which, at paragraph 16, cites the  case  of
       Lebon, in finding that it was not necessary to determine the reasons
       for financial support or raise the question as to whether the person
       is able to support himself by taking employment. The question  is  a
       factual one: simply whether or not the  family  member  is  able  to
       support themselves having  regard  to  their  financial  and  social
       conditions. It is not enough to show simply that  financial  support
       is provided by the EU national. There must be a  need  for  material
       support to meet  the  extended  family  member's  basic  needs.  The
       extended family member must be unable to support himself without the
       finances supplied by the EEA national and therefore the  support  of
       EU national must be necessary.

   27. We must take the findings of the previous decisions  of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal as our starting point in accordance with  the  starred
       decision of the Upper Tribunal Devaseelan [2002] UKAIT 702,  however
       these may be built upon and  the  outcome  of  this  appeal  may  be
       different from that of previous Tribunals and we  must  decide  this
       appeal on the evidence before us.

   28. First-tier Tribunal Judge Warner decided that the appellant had been
       dependent on Mrs Cherid whilst living in the UK since  2009  in  his
       2011 determination, but that his claim could not  succeed  as  there
       was no evidence he had been dependent on them prior to entry to  the
       UK.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Harris upheld this  position  in  his
       decision of 11th January 2013, and found that the appellant remained
       dependent on Mrs Cherid in the UK  but  again  had  shown  no  prior
       dependency in his  country  of  origin,  see  paragraph  45  of  his
       decision. Judge Harris decided that he could not be  satisfied  that
       there had been dependency on Mrs Cherid by the  appellant  prior  to
       his entering the UK as the only evidence was the oral  testimony  of
       the appellant, Mrs Cherid and her husband and discrepancies in  this
       evidence meant that they were not "reliable witnesses on their  word
       alone about the claimed dependence" in Algeria.

   29. The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Stokes allowing the
       appeal  of  Mr  Madani  Alem  promulgated  on  5th   November   2014
       [OA/21025/2013]  concerns  the  appellant's  twin  brother's  appeal
       against refusal of a family permit with an  identical  claim  to  be
       dependent on the same sponsors. We consider that it  is  appropriate
       to allow reliance upon this decision in  accordance  with  paragraph
       11.1 of the  Revised  Practice  Directions  Immigration  and  Asylum
       Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper  Tribunal  amended  on
       the 13th November 2014. In this  decision  the  credibility  of  the
       sponsors is said not to be in doubt as the dependency of Madani Alem
       was supported with documentation, see paragraph 24  and  25  of  the
       decision. It is found that provision of �80 a month  in  remittances
       by Mrs Cherid meant that Mr Madani Alem was financially dependent on
       his sponsor for his material needs, and qualified under Regulation 8
       of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 and  should  therefore  be
       issued with a family permit to come to the UK.

   30. It was not disputed by Mr Melvin that Mrs Cherid sends �100 a  month
       to the appellant,  and  on  the  combined  documentary  and  witness
       evidence provided to us we find that this takes place and has  taken
       place since his return  to  Algeria,  and  relying  upon  the  prior
       decisions  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  appellant   was
       supported and housed by Mrs Cherid and her husband in the  UK  going
       back to 2009.  Clearly this alone is not  sufficient  when  applying
       the test set out in Lim. We must be satisfied that  this  amount  is
       sufficient to meet the appellant's basic needs and that he does  not
       have other funds by which these basic needs are met.

   31. To approach these questions we must assess the  credibility  of  the
       witness evidence from Mrs Cherid and Mr F Alem. Mr  Melvin  suggests
       that the amount of �100 a month sent to the appellant is so derisory
       that it is not possible that the appellant is  solely  dependent  on
       these funds and thus the sponsors must be telling  untruths  as  the
       appellant must either be working or supported  by  other  relatives,
       which they deny. We do not however  find  that  this  amount  is  so
       derisory to meet the appellant's basic needs. It is described by the
       entry clearance officer in the refusal  notice  as  "modest"  but  a
       modest amount may meet basic needs. As Ms Anifowoshe has argued  the
       appellant has only to keep himself and not pay for accommodation  as
       he has a free room in a shared family  house.  We  note  that  Judge
       Stokes found a  slightly  lesser  amount  sufficient  to  allow  the
       appellant's twin brother's appeal. We do  not  find  this  a  proper
       basis to disbelieve the evidence of the witnesses.

   32. We note that Judge Harris did not find the evidence  of  Mrs  Cherid
       and Mr F Alem to be reliable relating to historic  support  for  the
       appellant in Algeria prior to his coming to the UK in  2008  due  to
       discrepancies in their evidence and that of the appellant.  However,
       Judge Harris and Judge Stokes did find them to have  given  reliable
       evidence about the UK dependency. The oral witness  evidence  before
       us was consistent with the statements and consistent as between  the
       witnesses themselves. The witnesses answered all  questions  put  to
       them in a full and helpful fashion, giving detailed explanations  to
       all matters put to them in rigorous cross-examination. We  therefore
       find that Mrs Cherid and Mr F Alem were credible witnesses.

   33. It is therefore the credible evidence of Mrs Cherid and  Mr  F  Alem
       that the remittances made by  Mrs  Cherid  cover  all  the  material
       living expenses of the appellant and that he has no other  resources
       on which he can rely as he receives no support from other  relatives
       and has not  managed  to  find  employment  due  to  high  rates  of
       unemployment  and  his  lack  of  skills,  qualifications  and  work
       experience. There is no evidence before us which  contradicts  this.
       We are therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that  the
       appellant is dependent on his sponsor for  his  material  needs  and
       that the support of his sponsors is necessary to meet  his  material
       needs as he has no other resources to draw upon.

   34. It follows that the appellant qualifies under Regulation  8  of  the
       Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 because he is a  relative  of  an
       EEA national and he is dependent upon that EEA national and he wants
       to join the EEA national in the  UK.  We  therefore  find  that  the
       refusal to issue the appellant with a family permit under Regulation
       12(4) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2016  was  unlawful  and
       this appeal should be allowed.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal with no  findings
      preserved.

   3. We re-make the decision by allowing it  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
      Regulations 2016.

Fee Award        Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of our decision to re-make the decision in the  appeal  by
    allowing it, we have considered whether to make a fee  award.  We  have
    had regard to the Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
    Immigration Appeals. We have decided to make no fee  award  because  we
    were not asked to make one by the appellant.

Signed: Fiona  Lindsley                                    Date:  3rd  April
