Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This decision in respect of the appellants'  appeals  is  made  on  the
    papers pursuant to rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.  The context in doing so  is  set  out  in  the  background
    below.

Background

 2. The appellants' appeals and the history of this litigation is  set  out
    in my decision and reasons dated 4th November  2020.   The  summary  is
    that I set aside the error of law decision  of  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Chana dated 7th November  2018.   The  consequence  is  that  the
    remaining three appellants' appeals against the decision of a Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Wyman, heard on 19th December  2017  at  Hatton
    Cross, in which he dismissed  the  appellants'  human  rights  appeals,
    remains to be decided.  Summarising  Judge  Wyman's  decision,  he  had
    considered the appeals of three  appellants  and  a  fourth  appellant,
    whose appeal has subsequently been treated as abandoned because he  has
    been granted indefinite leave to remain.

 3. The remaining appellants  comprise  the  wife  of  the  original  first
    appellant and their children, both born in the UK.  The appellants  had
    sought leave to remain based on their article 8 rights, having, in  the
    adults' cases, entered the UK in 2007/2008 and not  returned  to  their
    country of  origin,  Bangladesh  and  the  two  children  never  having
    returned to that country.  The genuineness of the relationships between
    the couple and their children was not disputed but in his decision, the
    FtT Judge concluded that the family could return  to  Bangladesh  as  a
    family unit.  The FtT Judge regarded the limited  evidence  as  to  any
    obstacles to the family's integration in Bangladesh where  they  had  a
    large family and noting their professional qualifications  as  lawyers.
    The FtT Judge turned, at �88 of his decision, to consideration  of  the
    three children, the eldest at the date of the hearing being now aged 8.
     The question was therefore whether it was reasonable to expect her  to
    leave the UK.  The FtT Judge considered factors under section  117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the  cost  of  the
    NHS care to the couple in the context of childbirth and also the wife's
    medical conditions.  There was no reason in the FtT  Judge's  view  why
    the children could not be educated in Bangladesh.

The Appellants' appeals

 4. The appellants appealed and on 25th June 2018, permission  was  granted
    by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor, as he then was,  on  30th
    August 2018.  He did not recite in  full  the  five  grounds  which  he
    regarded  as  unnecessarily  lengthy  but  instead  granted  permission
    focusing,  whilst  not  limiting  the  grant  of  permission,  on   two
    particular aspects  which  caused  him  concern.   The  first  was  the
    arguable error  in  the  FtT  Judge's  failure  to  address  the  first
    appellant's immigration history (see paragraph 276B of the Rules, which
    had been raised at the hearing) and  also  an  apparent  conflation  at
    paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  with  section  117B(6)  of  the   2002   Act.
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Moreover whilst the  FtT
    Judge had stated that significant weight had  been  attributed  to  the
    residence factor it was noted as only being of "some weight" and it was
    difficult to discern whether the FtT Judge had posed and then  answered
    the core question relating  to  "powerful  reasons"  which  might  have
    outweighed the eldest child's eight and a half years' residence.

Progress of Litigation

 5. Having set aside the decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Chana  I
    issued directions canvassing the views of the parties as to whether  it
    was appropriate to decide whether there had been an error of law on the
    papers noting the COVID restrictions at the time.  Highly  regrettably,
    the  appellants'  representatives,  MRKS  Solicitors,  have  repeatedly
    failed to comply with those directions and it was only in response to a
    Case Management Review hearing scheduled for Monday 12th July 2021 that
    finally, a  few  days  before  that  hearing  on  8th  July  2021,  the
    appellants'  solicitors  confirmed  that  they  were  content  for  the
    decision to be resolved on the papers.  However even then there appears
    to be some confusion as they consent to the decision being  decided  on
    the papers but then recite various parts of evidence without addressing
    the question of whether Judge Wyman had erred in law.

 6. For  her  part,  some  months  previously,  on  3  December  2020,  the
    respondent had conceded that Judge Wyman had materially erred  in  law.
    The concession reads as follows:

         "4.  [The grounds] in essence take issue with the manner  in  which
             FTTJ Wyman dealt with the issue of the  qualifying  child  (in
             terms of Section 117B(6)) at the date  of  the  hearing.   The
             [respondent]   concedes   that   the   FTTJ's   reasoning   is
             insufficiently clear to be sustainable and accepts,  therefore
             that this amounts to a  material  error.   In  light  of  this
             concession which requires a further hearing (either before the
             FTT or UT) a subsequent material change of circumstance of the
             children's father being granted ILR can be addressed.   It  is
             for this reason that the  other  grounds  are  now  considered
             immaterial.

         5.   To assist the Tribunal in clarifying the nature and nature and
             scope of the above concession the SSHD observes:

             (1)  It is accepted as being  insufficiently  clear  what  the
                  actual Section 55 'best interests'  finding  was  for  the
                  children  (particularly  the  qualifying  child).   It  is
                  accepted that the appellants contended  the  optimal  best
                  interests would be for the children to remain  in  the  UK
                  with their parents (the status quo  outcome).   Whilst  it
                  was of course open to the FTTJ even if accepting this  (if
                  that is what they intended to do) to find nonetheless that
                  the best interests were outweighed by other factors it  is
                  conceded  that  the  FTTJ  has  not  made  a   clear   and
                  sufficiently reasoned finding on this starting point.

             (2)  Whilst the FTTJ was clearly aware that  the  elder  child
                  was qualifying at the date  of  the  hearing  (the  author
                  considers the FTTJ at �90 to be recognising at the date of
                  the hearing the Immigration Rules would be satisfied if an
                  application were then made, rather than finding they  were
                  met  at  the  actual  application  date)  and  stated  the
                  question was "whether it would be reasonable to expect her
                  to leave the UK" this being the correct test at  the  date
                  of the hearing via Section 117B(6).  The FTTJ appears  not
                  thereafter to have made a finding under the  threshold  of
                  reasonableness.

             (3)  Whilst the FTTJ did consider many of the relevant factors
                  identified in  Home  Office  policy  and  endorsed  in  KO
                  (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018]  UKSC  53  the  FTTJ  does  rather
                  confusingly import into the section  headed  "Children"  a
                  series of  considerations  unconnected  to  the  issue  of
                  reasonableness.  The self-direction to the test  posed  by
                  paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) further confuses the matter  given
                  it occurs before the FTTJ concludes dealing with the issue
                  of the children.  ...

             (4)  In light of the above, the SSHD concedes that the grounds
                  (2) to (5) disclose material error such that the  decision
                  should be set aside.  The SSHD has no strong view  on  the
                  disposal (whether before FTT or UT) given it is likely the
                  appellant  would  wish  to  provide  an  updated  evidence
                  relating to Article 8.  The SSHD would draw  attention  to
                  the   facility   for   the   appellant   to   request    a
                  reconsideration  of  the  refusal  decision  in  light  of
                  updated evidence via submissions."

Discussion and Conclusions

 7. Central to  this  appeal  is  the  FtT  Judge's  consideration  of  the
    reasonableness of the return to Bangladesh of the minor children.   The
    respondent has expressly conceded, in my view correctly, that not  only
    did the FtT confuse consideration of the date by which the oldest minor
    appellant had become a qualifying child, but  it  appears  to  me  that
    there  has  been  no  clear  conclusion  on  the  key  issue   of   the
    reasonableness his return.  The respondent concedes, and I accept, that
    the errors are material.  In the circumstances, the FtT's conclusion is
    unsafe and cannot stand.

Decision on an Error of Law

 8. In light of the respondent's concessions there are material  errors  of
    law in the FTT's decision and I  must  set  it  aside,  preserving  the
    findings that the relationships between the  appellants  are  those  as
    claimed, namely that the first appellant is the mother of the two minor
    appellants  with  whom  she  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship and she is the wife of a person no longer party  to  these
    proceedings, who has indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

Disposal

 9. I have not been assisted by the late and confusing  communication  from
    MKRS Solicitors, who do not make clear what their view is, if  any,  on
    remittal of remaking back to the First-tier Tribunal.   Whilst  I  have
    preserved some findings I am very conscious that the  delay  caused  in
    part by MKRS Solicitors will have meant that the family's circumstances
    may well  have  materially  changed.   In  the  circumstances   and  by
    reference to paragraph 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement
    and the necessary updated fact-finding, I have  formed  the  view  that
    this is a case that should be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for
    remaking.




Notice of Decision

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law
    and I set it aside.

11. I remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing  subject
    to the findings of fact as set out in paragraph [9] above.



Directions to the First-Tier Tribunal

12. This appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  re-hearing
    subject to the preserved findings set out above.

13. The remitted appeal shall not be heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Wyman.

14. The anonymity directions continue.
