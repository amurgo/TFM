                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal against a decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Buckwell promulgated on 22nd March 2016,  in  which  he  allowed  the
       appellants appeals against the decisions of the UK  Visa  Section  of
       24th March 2015, to refuse the appellants applications for  leave  to
       enter the UK.


    2. The appellant before me is the UK Visa Section, and  the  respondents
       to this appeal are Miss Geethanchali Sivanantharaja and her  parents,
       Mr Sivanantharaja Ponnaiya and Mrs Deviga  Sivanantharaja.   However,
       for ease of reference, in the course of this  determination  I  shall
       adopt the parties' status as it was before the  First-tier  Tribunal.
       I shall in this determination, refer to Miss Sivanantharaja  and  her
       parents as the appellants, and the UK Visa Section as the respondent.


Background


    3. The appellants are all nationals of Sri Lanka, resident  in  Finland.
       At paragraph [3] of his decision, the Judge summarises the background
       to the applications made by  the  appellants.   The  first  appellant
       proposed to marry on 11th June 2015 to Satheeswaran Kanagaratnam, who
       is also a citizen of Sri Lanka and who  had  leave  to  remain  valid
       until 11th December 2015. A reception was planned in the UK  on  11th
       June 2015, and the first appellant stated that she  would  return  to
       Finland, to continue her university studies in  Oulu,  on  14th  July
       2015.   The applications by the second and third appellants were  for
       visitor leave, in order to be present in the UK for the  wedding  and
       related celebrations.


    4. The applications were refused by the UK Visa Section  on  24th  March
       2015, and it was those refusals that were the subject of the  appeals
       before the First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal  was  determined  by  the
       Judge on the papers, as requested by the appellants.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge sets out the background to the  appeals
       at paragraphs [1] to [6] of his decision.  At paragraphs [2] and  [7]
       of his decision, the Judge sets out the proper approach to an  appeal
       against a refusal of entry clearance as a visitor.  The  Judge  notes
       the grounds upon which an appeal can be brought  are  restricted.  In
       these appeals, the only relevant provision is that  the  decision  is
       unlawful under section 6 of  the  Human  Rights  Act.  That  is,  the
       decision is contrary to Article 8 ECHR.


    6. Having recorded the evidence, and the legal framework, the Judge sets
       out his findings and conclusions at paragraphs [14] to  [20]  of  his
       decision.  The Judge states, at paragraph [15]


             "....I find that here adequate evidence  was  presented  (that
             being shown by the evidence which the Respondent has  provided
             in the  Respondent's  bundles  for  these  appeals)  that  the
             situation was clear and that the First Appellant,  subject  to
             formalities,  was  indeed  going  to  marry  the   above-named
             gentleman.    In  such  circumstances  an  impending  marriage
             concerns individuals who will become very close relatives.  As
             a matter of principle I find that consideration of  Article  8
             ECHR operating outside the Immigration  Rules  would,  on  the
             basis of the caselaw to which I have referred, be  engaged  in
             relation to  the  circumstances  of  the  First  Appellant  in
             connection with her application under paragraph 56DD."


     The Judge went on to say at paragraph [17]


             "On the basis of the evidence set out above I do find that  in
             relation to the application of  the  First  Appellant  Article
             8(1) rights were engaged as the application concerned a  visit
             for the purposes of an impending marriage. Marriage of  course
             is one of the strongest relationships  which  can  be  entered
             into and I find that the caselaw  guidance  to  which  I  have
             referred supports a finding of the engagement of Article  8(1)
             ECHR."


    7. The Judge then turned, at paragraph [18] of his decision to  consider
       proportionality.  He found:


             "...  as  the  First  Appellant  was  applying  for  temporary
             permission to visit this  country,  and  had  visited  on  two
             previous occasions without any adverse consequences, I do  not
             find that public interest issues are here engaged in terms  of
             a proportionality assessment.  On the basis that I  find  that
             the application was genuine by the First Appellant and that it
             related to the  clearest  of  family  life  interests,  namely
             proposed marriage, I  do  not  find  that  the  Respondent  is
             entitled to rely upon Article 8(2) ECHR  in  response  to  the
             engagement of Article 8(1) ECHR rights in that respect."


    8. At paragraph [19] of his decision, the Judge turned to the appeals of
       the second and third appellants and states:


             "...having  found  that  the  decision  in  relation  to   the
             application of the First Appellant breached her engaged  human
             rights, with respect to  family  life,  as  a  consequence  my
             findings in relation to the appeals of the  Second  and  Third
             Appellants follows suit. Again I find that in respect of  both
             parental Appellants Article  8(1)  ECHR  rights  are  engaged.
             Clearly  they  have  a  direct  family  life  with  the  First
             Appellant as daughter. The circumstances of their applications
             relate to a visit to this  country  in  order  to  attend  her
             wedding. Little can be more significant to  parents  than  the
             marriage of  a  child  and  the  decision  by  the  Respondent
             breached  their  family  life  rights    to     attend     the
             planned     wedding     in     this     country.   Considering
             proportionality, and taking into account the  requirements  of
             paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules, I find  that  they  met
             the necessary requirements thereof.


    9. At paragraph [20] of his decision the Judge found no public  interest
       factors, with reference to section 117B of the 2002  Act,  to  be  of
       adverse relevance in an assessment of proportionality. He found  that
       both the second and third appellants sought  leave  to  enter  for  a
       limited period and there is no reason to believe that they would  not
       return to Finland at the end of  that  period.   He  found  that  the
       respondent would not be entitled to invoke reliance upon Article 8(2)
       ECHR in response to the engagement of Article 8(1) ECHR  rights.   At
       paragraph [21], the Judge  concluded  that  at  the  rights  of  each
       appellant were engaged on the basis  of  family  life  and  that  the
       decisions taken by the respondent unlawfully interfered therewith.


The grounds of appeal


   10. The respondent contends that the Judge erred in failing to  make  any
       finding as to whether there is a private and or family  life  between
       the first appellant and her intended spouse.  The respondent contends
       that the Judge did not find that the first appellant has  established
       a family life with  her  intended  spouse,  such  as  to  invoke  the
       protection of Article 8. The respondent contends that the decision of
       the Judge discloses a material error as to  the  law,  and  that  the
       Judge erred in his conclusion  that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry
       clearance amounts to a disproportionate interference with the Article
       8 rights of the appellants.  The  respondent  contends  that  in  his
       assessment of proportionality, the  Judge  failed  to  consider  that
       there is no evidence that  the  first  appellant's  marriage  to  her
       intended spouse, could take place in Finland or  elsewhere,  and  the
       Judge does not explain why the refusal of a visit  that  only  allows
       the parties to be together temporarily, amounts to a disproportionate
       interference with their Article 8 rights.  Insofar as the second  and
       third appellants are concerned, the respondent contends  that  again,
       the Judge appears to find that Article  8  is  engaged,  but  against
       there is no  finding  that  the  second  and  third  appellants  have
       established a family life with the first appellant, or  her  intended
       spouse.  In any event, the respondent contends that the  decision  to
       refuse  the  application  for  a  visit  visa  would  not  cause   an
       interference with their right to a family life in the  form  that  it
       currently exists.


   11. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Foudy
       on 11th August 2016.  The matter comes before me to consider  whether
       or not the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Buckwell  involved
       the making of a material error of law,  and  if  so,  to  remake  the
       decision.


   12. At the hearing of the appeal before me, there was no appearance by or
       on behalf of the appellants.  Before me, Mr  Clarke  submits  that  a
       careful reading of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       makes it clear that in reaching  his  decision,  the  Judge  gave  no
       proper consideration to the relationship between the first  appellant
       and her intended spouse.  Had he done so, it would  have  been  plain
       that the first appellant could not  establish  that  there  exists  a
       family life between her and  her  fianc�,  or  that  there  are  some
       compelling circumstances that weigh in favour of  the  appellants  in
       any assessment of proportionality, when considered against the public
       interest in the maintenance of immigration control. He  submits  that
       the Judge has not given sufficient reasons for finding that a  family
       life exists between the first appellant and her fianc�.


Discussion


   13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge correctly identified the parameters  of
       the appeal before him.  He properly identifies and directs himself to
       the legal framework for his decision at paragraphs [12] to  [13]  and
       [15] of his decision.


   14. In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC),  the
       Upper Tribunal held  that  the  claimant's  ability  to  satisfy  the
       immigration rules is  not  the  question  to  be  determined  by  the
       Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of   being   a   weighty,   though   not
       determinative,  factor  when  deciding  whether   such   refusal   is
       proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control.
        Only  in  very  unusual  circumstances,  likely  to  be  limited  to
       relationships of husband and wife,  other  close  life  partners,  or
       parent and minor child, will a person other than a close relative  be
       able to engage Article 8(1) in an entry clearance  case.  Abbasi  and
       another (visits - bereavement - Article 8) [2015]  UKUT  00463  (IAC)
       held that the refusal of a visa to foreign nationals seeking to enter
       the UK for a finite period for the purpose of  mourning  with  family
       members the recent death of a close relative and visiting  the  grave
       of a deceased person is capable of  constituting  a  disproportionate
       interference with the rights of the persons concerned  under  Article
       8, and that the question is fact-sensitive.


   15. The task of the judge was to determine whether the  decision  of  the
       respondent was unlawful under s6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.   That
       is, whether  the  decision  was  incompatible  with  the  appellant's
       Article 8 rights.  As set out in the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal
       in Adeji (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 261 (IAC),  the  first
       question to be addressed in an appeal  against  a  refusal  to  grant
       entry clearance as a visitor where  only  human  rights  grounds  are
       available, is whether Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged at all.  If it
       is not, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to embark upon an assessment
       of the decision under the rules and should not do so.  If  Article  8
       is engaged, the Tribunal may need to look at the extent to  which  an
       appellant is said to have failed to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
       rules because that may inform the proportionality balancing  exercise
       that must follow.


   16. In considering the appeal on Article 8 grounds, the Judge  refers  to
       decision in R -v- SSHD ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, but it is  far
       from clear whether the Judge adequately addressed  the  five  stages.
       It is uncontroversial that the Tribunal must first determine  whether
       Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged at all. If it is not,  the  Tribunal
       has no jurisdiction to embark upon an  assessment  of  the  remaining
       issues identified in Razgar.  If Article 8 is engaged,  the  Tribunal
       should have gone on to consider the remaining four stages  identified
       in Razgar.


   17. At paragraph [17] of  his  decision,  the  Judge  found  that  it  in
       relation to the application of the first appellant, Article  8(1)  is
       engaged as the application concerned a visit for the purposes  of  an
       impending marriage.  It is right to recognise that the appellant  and
       her fianc� were intending to marry, but the Judge fails  to  set  out
       the evidential basis upon which he  concludes  that  there  exists  a
       family life between  the  first  appellant  and  her  sponsor.    The
       authorities make it clear that family life is likely in this  context
       to be limited to relationships of husband and wife, and  other  close
       life partners and that only in  very  unusual  circumstances  will  a
       person other than a close relative be able to engage Article 8(1)  in
       an entry clearance case. Furthermore, in my judgement, the Judge  did
       not go on to adequately consider whether the interference  will  have
       consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage  the  operation
       of Article 8.  In his decision, the Judge did  not  consider  whether
       the appellant's marriage to her fianc�, who the Judge noted was not a
       citizen of the UK and who himself had time limited leave to remain in
       the UK, could take place in Finland or indeed elsewhere.


   18. In my judgement, the Judge did not properly consider the question  of
       whether there existed a family life between the first  appellant  and
       her sponsor who were not at that point, husband and wife,  and  where
       there  appears  to  have  been  a  paucity  of  evidence  about  that
       relationship beyond their desire to  marry  in  the  UK.   The  Judge
       failed to adequately consider whether the relationship was such as to
       found a family life.  The first appellant and her fianc� intended  to
       marry and there was some  evidence  of  the  first  appellant  having
       visited the UK previously in September 2012 and  May  2013.   As  two
       people that wished to marry, they might well be in a relationship but
       in my judgment, that is not enough to justify  a  finding  of  family
       life. There is no presumption; it all depends on the facts and  I  am
       satisfied that there is an error of law in the decision. It therefore
       falls to me to remake the Decision.


   19. I have carefully considered the first appellant's desire to marry her
       sponsor in the UK but that does not equate to a right to do  so.  The
       appellant's sponsor did not attend the hearing before the  First-tier
       Tribunal  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  the  strengths  of   that
       relationship. Equally, there is no  evidence  before  me  as  to  the
       immigration status of the appellant's sponsor, or any explanation  as
       to why the marriage could not take place elsewhere, including Finland
       or indeed in Sri Lanka such as to enable me to find that Article 8 is
       engaged  and  that  the  refusal  of  entry   clearance   will   have
       consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage  the  operation
       of Article 8.


   20. On the evidence before the Judge, therefore, I  am  quite  unable  to
       find that Article 8 is engaged in this case.  That  disposes  of  the
       appeal before me which therefore stands dismissed.
