                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. For the sake of consistency with the  First-tier  Tribunal,  I  will
       refer to Ms Fajardo as the Appellant and the Secretary of  State  as
       the Respondent. I note here that there appears to be  no  appeal  in
       the linked matter EA/09308/2016 regarding  [JP]  which  was  allowed
       following consideration on 18 January 2017.


    2. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for  a  Permanent
       Residence Card on 15 June 2016. Her appeal against that was  allowed
       by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mailer  ("the   Judge")   following
       consideration of the papers on 24 December 2016.

    3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Pedro granted permission to appeal (24 May
       2017). He said it is arguable that the Judge failed to give adequate
       reasons for concluding at [26] that the Appellant had established  5
       years' continuous exercise of EEA Treaty Rights.

The Judgement

    4. The Judge notes under the heading "Assessment"

       "[23]     The  appellant  has  produced  documentation  showing  her
       employment for periods between 1999 and 2016. The originals have not
       been produced.

       [24] However, I  have  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the  documents
       produced  are  anything  other  than  genuine  and  authentic.   The
       respondent refused her application on the basis that photocopies are
       not accepted. The appellant has stated that she does not possess all
       the original documents and would have been willing to  provide  them
       if the respondent made a request.

       [25] The appellant has also produced evidence as  to  her  residence
       and addresses from time to time. She has produced HMRC  PAYE  coding
       notices for the year 2013-14 sent to her  address  in  Bromley.  The
       London Borough of Lewisham Treasurer informed her that her  new  tax
       code for the year 6 April 2013 until 5 April 2014 would replace  her
       earlier code.

       [26] Having regard to her evidence as a whole I  am  satisfied  that
       the appellant has shown on the balance of probabilities that she has
       been exercising Treaty rights in the UK for five continuous years as
       a worker."

Discussion

    5. The Respondent  was  concerned  that  in  1999/00  and  2000/01  the
       Appellant  earned  �691  and  �537.56   annually   which   indicates
       negligible employment. She gave birth on 24  October  2004  and  was
       entitled to a reasonable amount  of  maternity  leave  but  did  not
       return to work until either  2008  or  2009.  The  P60  for  2009/10
       records an annual income  of  �987.  This  pattern  falls  short  of
       establishing a period of 5 years' continuous exercise of  EEA  Treat
       Rights.

    6. Given the fact that the  Appellant  was  unrepresented  I  took  her
       carefully  through  the  determination  and  tried  to  ensure   she
       understood the Respondent's concerns about the lack of evidence  and
       regarding the Judgement. She simply said that her documents had been
       produced.

    7. I note that the Appellant had sought an appeal on the papers at  the
       first  hearing.  Her  grounds  of  appeal  did  not  deal  with  the
       Respondent's concerns and were generic in nature. She had  filed  no
       statement within her 241 page bundle that addressed those  concerns.
       The judgement did not deal with the concerns in any material way. It
       was inadequate to say that the documents were genuine as  that  does
       not address the issue of the "gaps" in having a meaningful income or
       any income. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge  did  materially
       err in relation to whether the Appellant  had  been  exercising  EEA
       Treaty Rights for the 5 year period required as the findings did not
       address the unchallenged concerns raised by the Respondent.

    8. Having heard submissions, I agreed that it was appropriate to  remit
       the matter for a de novo consideration by a Judge other  than  Judge
       Mailer. As the Appellant only paid for a paper hearing, I  explained
       to her the need to file evidence seeking to answer the  Respondent's
       concerns, and if she wished to have an oral hearing, she may need to
       pay the balance of the oral hearing fee.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision.

    I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for it to  be  considered
    de novo by a Judge other than Judge Mailer.
