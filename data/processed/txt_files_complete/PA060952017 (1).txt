Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A. Bandegani, counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis,
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION

   1. The appellant, who is a citizen of Jordan, arrived in the UK  in  July
      2007 and was admitted as a visitor. He overstayed that leave and  next
      came to notice on 20 July 2017 when he was encountered by  immigration
      officers during an  enforcement  visit  to  commercial  premises.  The
      appellant produced a counterfeit  French  passport  and,  having  been
      served with notice of liability to be removed, he claimed asylum.


   2. The appellant said he faced  a  risk  of  death  or  persecutory  ill-
      treatment on return to Jordan at the hands of relatives  of  a  former
      girlfriend because they did not approve of  that  relationship.  Those
      relatives rejected  his  proposal  of  marriage  and  when  they  then
      discovered that she was pregnant they accused him of rape and attacked
      him, that being in the presence of police officers who participated in
      beating the appellant. The appellant points to that police involvement
      as indicative of the involvement of state agents  in  the  persecutory
      ill-treatment he claims to have suffered. He was then dispossessed  of
      all he owned and fled Jordan for his own safety.


   3. The respondent refused the claim because it was not accepted that  the
      appellant's claim was true.


   4. The appellant  was  unrepresented  before  the  judge  and  sought  an
      adjournment, explaining that he had paid ï¿½5,000  to  a  barrister  who
      then said he could not attend to represent  him.   The  judge  refused
      that application on the basis that the appellant  had  had  sufficient
      time to instruct a lawyer.


   5. The first of the grounds upon which permission to  appeal  was  sought
      and granted is that in refusing the application for an adjournment the
      judge made an error of law. It is submitted that had the judge engaged
      with the application being pursued he would have appreciated that  the
      appellant had received wholly inadequate legal advice from his  former
      representatives; that as the appellant was in  detention  it  was  not
      possible at such  short  notice  to  instruct  fresh  representatives,
      although Duncan Lewis were willing to accept  instructions  but  could
      not arrange to see the appellant in detention until after the date  of
      the  hearing and that, as this was a protection  claim, the judge  was
      required to give anxious scrutiny to the application but he failed  to
      do so. Indeed, it is not apparent that the judge made any enquiry into
      the circumstances that led to the appellant, who had  demonstrated  an
      intention and ability to fund legal representation, came to be without
      representation at the appeal hearing.


   6. Mr Bandegani drew attention also to the fact that shortly  before  the
      hearing  the  appellant  had  made  a  written  application   for   an
      adjournment, explaining that he now had no legal  representation  and,
      being in detention at Harmondsworth,  he  was  "struggling  to  get  a
      solicitor due to this reason".


   7. The appellant's grounds, adopted and developed in  submissions  by  Mr
      Bandegani, do identify matters that give rise to  cause  for  concern.
      With  respect  to  the  judge  of  the   First-tier   Tribunal,   this
      determination appears on its face not to have been produced  with  the
      care that was required. There  are  many  typographical  errors  which
      suggests that it was not checked or proof read. The judge  contradicts
      himself in saying both that  he  had  a  witness  statement  from  the
      appellant and that he did not have a statement. It  should  have  been
      obvious to the  judge  that  the  grounds  of  appeal,  despite  being
      professionally drafted, disclosed a  fundamental  misunderstanding  of
      the legal framework in play in advancing the appeal. However,  despite
      this, the only reason given by the judge for refusing the  application
      for an adjournment was that the appellant had had sufficient  time  to
      arrange for legal representation.


   8. But of course, that is precisely what the appellant had thought he had
      done in retaining, and paying  for,  professional  representation.  It
      appears not to be in dispute that it was only after  he  had  done  so
      that the representative informed him that he  would  not,  after  all,
      provide representation, leaving the appellant to find  a  fresh  legal
      representative. Further, his present solicitors  have  explained  that
      they could not arrange an appointment to take  instructions  from  the
      appellant, who remained in detention, until  after  the  date  of  the
      hearing.


   9. The duty of the judge was to ensure that the appellant received a fair
      hearing of his appeal. In refusing the application for an  adjournment
      he left out of account material considerations and that indicates that
      he did not bring to his task the anxious scrutiny demanded of  him  in
      determining a protection claim.


  10. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Melvin submitted that the judge  dealt
      adequately with the adjournment request and that it was open to him to
      refuse the application. Mr Melvin submitted also  that  the  appellant
      had ample time to make arrangements for his representation.


  11. We are satisfied that, in the circumstances,  it  was  not  reasonably
      open to the judge to refuse the application  for  an  adjournment,  at
      least without carrying out a proper enquiry into the circumstances  in
      which the appellant had found himself  without  legal  representation.
      Therefore, that  is  sufficient  to  establish  that  there  has  been
      unfairness such as to amount to an error of law.


  12. The next question to be addressed is whether that  error  of  law  was
      material to the outcome, such as to require that the appeal to the  UT
      be allowed to the extent that the decision to dismiss  the  appeal  is
      set aside and the appeal is remitted to  the  F-tT  to  be  determined
      afresh.


  13. The  consequence  of  our  conclusion  that  the  application  for  an
      adjournment should have been granted is that the  appellant  has  been
      deprived of what he reasonably sought, which was to present  his  case
      with the benefit of professional legal  representation.  It  might  be
      observed that the respondent could have, but  chose  not  to,  certify
      this asylum claim as clearly unfounded and it follows that  the  claim
      is one that was considered at least arguable.


  14. Certainly, the respondent has raised a respectable  challenge  to  the
      appellant's claim and he may or may not be able to establish  that  he
      has a well-founded fear of persecution  on  return  to  Jordan  for  a
      reason  recognised  by  the  Refugee  Convention.  We  are,   however,
      satisfied that he should at least have a proper opportunity to advance
      that claim before the First-tier Tribunal, an opportunity that we  are
      satisfied has so far not been provided.


  15. In the light of that conclusion, it is unnecessary for us  to  address
      the other grounds of appeal.


  16. For these reasons, the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  is  allowed.  The
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Khan is set  aside  in  its
      entirety and the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be
      determined afresh.

   Summary of decision:

   1. First-tier Tribunal Judge M. A. Khan made a material error of law  and
      his decision to dismiss the appeal is set aside. His determination  is
      to be set aside in its entirety.

   2. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed to  the  extent  that  the
      appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined afresh.
