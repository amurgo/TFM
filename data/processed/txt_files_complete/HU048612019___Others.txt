                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 10 June 2019 of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge G Mitchell which refused the Article 8 ECHR  appeals  of
    the appellants.

 2. The  appellants  are  nationals  of  Bangladesh.  They  are  a  family,
    comprising father, mother and child.

 3. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal proceeded in the  absence  of
    the appellants.  The  appellants  maintain  that  this  amounted  to  a
    procedural irregularity where they had applied for  an  adjournment  on
    medical grounds and had included medical documents  showing  that  they
    were unwell at the time of the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  Where  the
    adjournment application was not considered by the First-tier  Tribunal,
    procedural error arose.

 4. The respondent conceded that the appellants had provided materials that
    should have led the First-tier  Tribunal  to  consider  adjourning  the
    appeal and which were  sufficiently  cogent  to  have  allowed  for  an
    adjournment to be granted. The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  address
    those matters and where that was so, a  clear  procedural  error  arose
    such that the decision should be set aside entirely to  be  re-made  de
    novo in the First-Tier Tribunal.  For what it is worth,  the  documents
    on the Tribunal  file  were  wholly  consistent  with  the  appellants'
    submissions on having made an adjournment application which was not put
    to the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. The Upper Tribunal finds that the decision of the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    discloses a material error on a point of law and sets it aside to be re-
    made de novo in the First-Tier Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law and is set aside to be remade de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.
