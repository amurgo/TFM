For the Appellant:     Mr W Evans, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 23rd October  1970.   The
    Appellant  entered  the  UK  illegally  in   2002   but   was   granted
    discretionary  leave  until  3rd  August  2014.   An  application   was
    submitted on his behalf on 23rd July 2014 to vary his leave  for  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of his family and  private
    life in the UK.   The  Appellant's  application  was  considered  under
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration  Rules  and  was
    refused by reason for refusal letter dated 29th September 2014.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Wyman on 7th January 2015.  The appeal was dealt with  on
    the papers and in a determination promulgated on 26th January 2015  the
    Appellant's appeal was allowed.

 3. On 1st February 2015 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of Appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal.  The Grounds of Appeal acknowledged that the appeal
    was against the decision of  the  Respondent  to  refuse  to  vary  the
    Appellant's discretionary leave to remain in line  with  her  published
    policy and that it was accepted that what was said at paragraphs 19  to
    22 of the determination was an accurate  prï¿½cis  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy.  However it was submitted that the  learned  judge  had
    erred in this consideration of change in circumstances and that it  was
    submitted that in  the  absence  of  an  assessment  of  the  situation
    prevailing between the Appellant and his stepdaughter, the finding that
    circumstances had not changed was not sustainable.   The  Secretary  of
    State averred that the Appellant's stepdaughters attaining majority had
    created a presumption that circumstances had changed.  And that it  was
    necessary to make what is described as a Kugathas assessment  in  order
    to rebut that presumption and that there was no such assessment in  the
    determination.

 4. On 9th March 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Baker granted permission to
    appeal.   The  reasons  for  permission  are  quite  lengthy  and  they
    helpfully set out the accepted  family  history,  namely  that  on  3rd
    August 2011 the Appellant had been granted discretionary leave  on  the
    basis of his family life with  his  wife  and  stepdaughter  until  3rd
    August 2014.  The Appellant and his wife had married on 22nd July  2006
    and  his  wife  and  stepdaughter  are  British   citizens.    It   was
    acknowledged  that  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  continued  to  live
    together.  The judge had noted at paragraph 11 of his decision that the
    Appellant's stepdaughter was now over 18 and was regarded as  an  adult
    and able to live independently and thus that there had been a change of
    circumstances such that the Appellant no longer met the requirements of
    paragraph 322(1) of the Immigration Rules.  Further it was acknowledged
    by the Respondent that the  Appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship  with  his  British  partner  but  that  there   were   no
    "insurmountable obstacles" to continuing their family life outside  the
    United Kingdom.

 5. Judge Baker noted that the grounds challenged the failure of the  judge
    to address Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 in assessing  the  circumstances
    and relationship of and between the  Appellant  and  his  stepdaughter.
    Judge Baker noted that the grounds at paragraph  4  asserted  that  the
    Appellant's  stepdaughter,   having   attained   majority   created   a
    presumption  that  circumstances  had  changed  requiring  a   positive
    Kugathas assessment in  order  to  rebut  it  and  there  was  no  such
    assessment in the decision.  Judge  Baker  noted  that  the  judge  had
    concluded that whether she was a student at university or  not  he  did
    not find that to be a significant factor "so that further discretionary
    leave should not be granted".  Judge Baker thereafter at  paragraphs  5
    and 6 of the grant of permission set out the findings made by the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge but concludes that he may have materially erred  in
    finding that there was family life despite the age and circumstances of
    the Appellant.

 6. On 13th April 2015 the Appellant's solicitors by way of letter provided
    a Rule 24 response.  It was on that basis that the appeal comes  before
    me to determine whether or not there is a material error of law in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  I note that this is an appeal  by
    the Secretary of State but for the purpose of continuity throughout the
    appeal process Mr Buagu is referred to herein  as  the  Appellant.   Mr
    Buagu appears by his instructed legal  representative  Mr  Evans.   The
    Secretary of State appears by her Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  Ms
    Everett.  In addition I am provided with a supplemental bundle  by  the
    Appellant's  instructed  solicitors  which  includes  a   supplementary
    witness statement of Darlene Gera, the Appellant's  stepdaughter  dated
    28th July 2015.  Whilst no evidence is taken in this appeal Ms  Everett
    does not object to me  having  "read  through  consideration"  of  this
    document of the bundle generally.

Submission/Discussion

 7. Ms Everett submits that this appeal turns on very  narrow  grounds  and
    that is whether or not the judge has or has not applied the right test,
    i.e.  is  there  any  additional  dependency.   She  submits  that  the
    determination is very  sparse  in  consideration  of  the  relationship
    albeit she acknowledges that the appeal was dealt with  on  the  papers
    that  were  available  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.    She
    stipulates that if I look at the first bundle that was before the First-
    tier Tribunal there are witness statements from  the  Appellant's  wife
    and stepdaughter which do address the issue and that the wife does  not
    stipulate that she would not be in a position to relocate.  Ms  Everett
    does not challenge the finding that  the  Appellant's  stepdaughter  is
    attending City University.

 8. Mr Evans relies on his Rule 24 response submitting that the Immigration
    Judge was entitled to find that the Respondent's circumstances had  not
    changed as he continued to share  a  family  life  with  his  wife  and
    dependent stepdaughter.  Mr Evans points out that the family  all  live
    together under one roof and as one household.   He  contends  that  the
    judge has properly addressed the issues and that there is no  error  of
    law.

The Law

 9.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

10. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

11. I am helped by the approach adopted Ms  Everett  in  this  matter.   It
    seems clear that the judge has  unfortunately  failed  to  address  the
    principles of Kugathas and as such has materially erred in  law  albeit
    that ultimately my finding in this matter is that the  decision  should
    be remade allowing the appeal.  In many respects I do not criticise the
    judge.  For some reason this appeal was dealt with on the papers rather
    than by way of oral submissions and he was clearly unaware of  some  of
    the issues that may well have been raised.

The Remaking of the Decision

12. The judge was aware that Miss Gera had reached the age of  majority  as
    is set out at paragraph 35 of his determination and it was open to  him
    to reach  a  view  that  that  change  in  her  circumstances  was  not
    sufficient to warrant the enforced breakup of the family unit.  However
    there are certain principles that he should have addressed and set out.
     The courts have stated that the family ties between adults  and  their
    parents  and/or  siblings  attract  less  protection  unless  there  is
    evidence of further elements of  dependency  involving  more  than  the
    normal emotional ties.  Domestic courts applied  this  test  of  family
    life to relationships between adults and their siblings and parents  as
    well as to more extended family ties between  adults.   This  principle
    reflects the fact-specificity of "family life"  under  Article  8.   It
    should not be taken to mean that protected  family  life  cannot  exist
    between healthy adults and their siblings or parents or extended family
    members.  The Kugathas principles were  reviewed  and  reconsidered  in
    Singh v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]  EWCA  630.
    Some assistance in this  matter  is  given  as  part  of  the  judgment
    therein:

         "A young adult living with his parents or  siblings  will  normally
         have a family life to  be  respected  under  Article  8.   A  child
         enjoying a family life with his parents does not suddenly cease  to
         have a family life at midnight as he turns 18 years of age.  On the
         other hand, a young adult living independently of his  parents  may
         well not have a family life for the purposes of Article 8."

13. In this matter it is accepted that Miss Gera has attained 18  years  of
    age  and  has  gone  to  university.   It  is  agreed  by  both   legal
    representatives, and I endorse this view, that the fact  in  itself  of
    attending university cannot be determinative.  However  Miss  Gera  has
    had the Appellant as her father figure for the last nine  years  and  I
    accept, as did the First-tier Tribunal Judge,  that  she  continues  to
    rely  on  both  her  mother  and  the  Appellant  both  materially  and
    emotionally.  She is not living a fully independent  life  and  she  is
    dependent upon the Appellant  and  her  mother  for  accommodation  and
    subsistence and she continues to live at the family home.

14. In such circumstances I am satisfied that the finding of the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was the correct one.  The fact that he had failed to  go
    through the appropriate test when considering the position as  set  out
    in case law is material.  However he came up with  the  decision  which
    was the right one.  Ms Everett, as I  stipulated  earlier,  was  candid
    enough to indicate that the Secretary of State acknowledged that if the
    proper legal approach was adopted then the finding  ultimately  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge was sustainable and she effectively,  without
    consenting, indicated that this was a course that  would  be  perfectly
    open to me.  I endorse that view  and  for  all  the  above  reasons  I
    therefore remake the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  dismiss
    the appeal of the Secretary of State.

Notice of Decision

The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed and the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal is  remade  and  consequently  maintained  allowing  the
Appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
