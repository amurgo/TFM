Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins, Counsel, instructed by Acculegal
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the decision  of  the
    respondent dated 26 March 2013 to refuse to vary his leave to remain in
    the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, and against her  concomitant
    decision to remove him by way of directions under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity order, and I do not  consider  that  such  an
    order is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant initially applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant on the basis that he had access to over �200,000
    in cash, which was held in foreign bank accounts.  In  his  application
    form he said he was part of an entrepreneurial team, and he  identified
    as his other member of the entrepreneurial team  Mr  Vangari  Kumar,  a
    fellow Indian national.  Mr Kumar made  his  application  on  8  August
    2012, and the appellant made his application on 25 August 2012.

 3. Prior to a decision being  made  on  the  appellant's  application,  he
    provided a letter stating his circumstances had changed and that he had
    invested a sum slightly in excess of  �50,000  in  GM  Enterprises  PVT
    Limited, which had recently taken over a filling station in Sunderland.
     The appellant said he had been offered the position of director in the
    company.  Appendix I of the  respondent's  bundle  contains  a  receipt
    dated  25  October  2012  issued  by  the  company  to  the  appellant,
    confirming that the company has received a total sum  of  �50,034  from
    him.

 4. On 26 March 2013 the respondent  refused  the  appellant's  application
    inter alia under paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules on the basis  that  the
    documents provided by him in support of Access to Funds were false.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Adio to be determined  on  the
    papers at Hatton Cross on 4 April 2014.  He dismissed the appeal  under
    the Rules.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 6. The appellant instructed Acculegal Solicitors  to  assist  him  in  his
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   His  case
    was that, despite relying on the same source of funding as Mr Kumar, he
    had submitted a separate set of  documents,  including  a  letter  from
    Oriental Bank of Commerce dated 20 June 2012, a  separate  letter  from
    Central Bank of India dated 9 July 2012 and a  letter  from  the  State
    Bank of Hyderabad dated 23 June 2012.  On or around  12  November  2012
    the appellant had varied his initial application by way of submitting a
    change of circumstances form. This was due to  investment  of  his  own
    money in GM Enterprise PVT Limited. He had thereby severed himself from
    the entrepreneur team, which the respondent acknowledged.

 7. In refusing the application on 26 March 2013, the respondent had relied
    on bank documents submitted by Mr Kumar instead of the  bank  documents
    submitted by the appellant.  It was the documents submitted by Mr Kumar
    that had two additional sentences added to it at the bottom  right-hand
    corner which were not authenticated by the  issuing  party.   The  bank
    documents submitted by the appellant did not have these additions.

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal in relation  to  the  refusal
    under paragraph 322(1A) on the following basis:

      a) the judge had erred in law in  failing  to  first  ascertain  which
         version of documents was actually submitted to  the  respondent  in
         support of the appellant's Tier 1 entrepreneur application;

      b) the judge had erred in law in considering documents that  were  not
         submitted by the  appellant  in  support  of  his  application  and
         adjudicating that the respondent had discharged  her  burden  under
         paragraph 322(1A) to establish that they were false;

      c) the finding that the appellant had contravened paragraph 322(1A) of
         the Rules had had a detrimental effect on the appellant's right  to
         remain and on all the appellant's future applications.

 9. The judge had also erred in law in failing to consider the  appellant's
    private life under Article 8  ECHR  when  the  appellant  had  invested
    heavily for over five years in his education, and now in business.

10. Thirdly, the judge had erred in law in failing to adjudicate at all  on
    the erroneous removal directions of the respondent under Section 47  of
    the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

11. On 22 May 2014 Designated Judge Zucker granted permission to appeal for
    the following reasons:

         "The grounds, which I accept have been lodged in time,  submit  the
         judge's analysis of the issues arising under paragraph 322(1A)  are
         flawed.   I have  some  difficulty  reconciling  what  appears  at
         paragraph  12  with  what  appears   at   paragraph   16   of   the
         determination.  It is not clear whether the judge found  in  favour
         or against the appellant on this important issue."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12. At the error of law hearing before me, I found that an error of law was
    made out with regard to the judge's disposal of  the  question  whether
    the  respondent  had  discharged  the  burden  of  proving   that   the
    application had been rightly refused under  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the
    Rules, and my reasons for  so  finding  are  set  out  below.   I  then
    received submissions from both Mr Collins and Mr Tufan as  to  how  the
    decision should be remade.  It was agreed that the best course  was  to
    remit the appellant's application  for  further  consideration  by  the
    Secretary of State, for reasons upon which I expand below.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

13. The decision of Judge Adio on paragraph 322(1A) discloses a clear error
    of law as he has made inconsistent findings.

14. There is no difficulty in the judge's finding at paragraph 11 that  the
    respondent  has  not  discharged  the  burden  of  proving   that   the
    certificate of balance from the Central Bank of India  is  false.   The
    judge does not depart from this finding later in his determination.

15. But at paragraph 12, he finds the respondent has discharged the  burden
    of proof with regard to the certificate of balance for the  State  Bank
    of Hyderabad.  At paragraph 13 the judge also finds that the respondent
    has made out the case under paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules with  regard
    to the certificate of balance for the Oriental Bank of Commerce.

16. At paragraphs 14 and 15 the judge addresses the appellant's explanation
    that there is "a big difference" between the certificates he  submitted
    and the certificates mentioned by UKBA.  At the end  of  paragraph  15,
    the judge says as follows: "I prefer the account in the DVR in view  of
    my analysis above."

17. But at the beginning of paragraph 16 he finds that the  respondent  has
    not discharged the burden of proof that the appellant  submitted  false
    documents as claimed by the respondent.  He says the appellant has been
    able to highlight the differences in the certificates he submitted  and
    more  importantly  the  respondent  has  not  provided   any   document
    verification report or communication between the relevant banks to show
    that the appellant's documents are false.   He  says  he  is  therefore
    willing to give the appellant the benefit of doubt in finding that  the
    appellant had submitted documents to show that he had access  to  funds
    as required.  The same would apply, he finds,  to  funds  held  in  the
    regulated financial institution.  He therefore finds that the appellant
    satisfied the requirements with regard to access to funds.

18. The judge goes on to find that the appellant does not  however  satisfy
    the requirements with regard to proof of investment of funds, which was
    the basis on which the appellant varied  his  application  in  November
    2012.  He also finds that the appellant did not meet  the  requirements
    of Appendix C on the basis of the bank statement which he provided with
    the application.  The appellant  sought  to  rely  on  two  other  bank
    statements to show that he met the maintenance requirement of  Appendix
    C, but as these had been provided after the date  of  application,  the
    judge held that he could not take these into account.

19. It is not contended by way of appeal that the judge erred in law in his
    findings under Appendix C, or in finding that  the  appellant  had  not
    provided the specified documents to show that he qualified for leave to
    remain on the alternative basis of investment of �50,000 in  a  new  or
    existing business. However there are Robinson obvious errors  in  these
    findings.

20. The logic of the positive finding made at  paragraph  16  is  that  the
    appellant can rely on the original basis of his application, which  was
    access to at least �200,000 in funds. So it does not  matter  that  the
    appellant has not proved investment of �50,000. As for compliance  with
    Appendix C, while the general rule is that the applicant has to provide
    the specified bank  statements  with  the  application,  the  voluntary
    provision of additional bank statements after the date  of  application
    will not necessarily be excluded from consideration, having  regard  to
    the evidential flexibility policy codified in paragraph  245AA  of  the
    rules.



21. Alternatively, as the Section 47 removal decision was  made  before  an
    amendment to Section 47 came into effect on 8 May 2013, the Section  47
    removal decision against the appellant was unlawful following  Adamally
    and Jaferi.  So, absent the adverse finding  under  paragraph  322(1A),
    there  would  be  no  impediment  to  the  appellant  making  a   fresh
    application as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant,  relying  on  specified
    documents that he failed to provide with his original application.

Conclusion

22. For the above reasons, the decision of Judge Adio contains an error  of
    law such that the decision appealed against should  be  set  aside  and
    remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

23. As I indicated at the outset of the  hearing,  the  appellant's  appeal
    against removal is allowed on the ground that it was not in  accordance
    with the law, following Adamally and Jaferi.

24. With regard to the decision to refuse to vary the appellant's leave, in
    the normal course of events the appropriate course would  be  to  remit
    the appeal for  a  de  novo  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine inter alia the crucial question of whether the refusal  under
    paragraph 322(1A) is made out.

25. But given the nature of the appellant's case  in  rebuttal,  it  is  in
    accordance with the overriding objective that the  Secretary  of  State
    should reconsider the refusal under paragraph 322(1A).   The  Secretary
    of State is best placed to ascertain whether the appellant  supplied  a
    different set of bank letters with  his  application,  as  detailed  in
    paragraph 14 of Judge Adio's determination; and, if so,  the  Secretary
    of  State  should  be  the  primary  decision-maker  on  whether  these
    different bank letters showed  access  to  funds,  and  on  whether  to
    exercise discretion in respect of acknowledged defects in the  original
    application with regard to Appendix C.

26. It is clear from the document verification report in  the  respondent's
    bundle that the documents in respect of which verification  was  sought
    were documents provided by Mr Kumar. So a lawful  decision  on  whether
    documents provided by the appellant trigger a refusal  under  paragraph
    322(1A) remains outstanding.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
contained an error  of  law,  and  accordingly  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the appellant's  appeal  against  removal  is  allowed  on  the
ground that the Section 47 removal decision was not in accordance  with  the
law; and the appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse to  vary  his
leave to remain is allowed on the ground that it is not in  accordance  with
the law, and the application is remitted  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for
further consideration.
