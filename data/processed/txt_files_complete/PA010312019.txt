Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involves  protection  issues.   We  find  that  it  is  appropriate  to
continue  the  order.   Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or  court   directs
otherwise,  the  appellant  is  granted  anonymity.   No  report  of   these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
family.  This direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D. Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P. Haywood, instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
                    Solicitors (Harrow Office)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   For the sake of continuity, we shall refer to the parties as they were
before the First-tier Tribunal although technically this is an appeal by
the Secretary of State to the Upper Tribunal.

2.   The appellant (TY) appealed the respondent's (SSHD) decision dated 01
February 2019 to refuse a fresh protection and human rights claim in the
context of deportation proceedings. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross ("the
judge") allowed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 21 October 2019.
The judge set out the issues raised in the fresh claim.  He considered the
history of the claim and the fact that a previous appeal was heard by the
First-tier Tribunal in 2004.

3.   The judge noted that there was evidence to suggest that the appellant
was a vulnerable witness and treated him as such [12].  It seems that there
was some agreement at the beginning of the hearing that the appellant would
not give oral evidence although he attended the hearing. Other witnesses,
including the appellant's brother and his wife also attended the hearing.
None of those witnesses were called or were asked to be cross-examined.

4.   The core of the previous claim was broadly accepted by an earlier
First-tier Tribunal judge. The fresh claim relied largely on the
applicant's activities for the TGTE in the UK. The Secretary of State
expressed doubts about the nature and extent of those activities in the
decision letter. The Secretary of State made the following points (i) the
evidence did not show that he was a high-level member of the TGTE; and (ii)
even if he had carried out some activities for the organisation it was
asserted that he had done so in a cynical way to bolster a fresh claim.

5.   Having set out the background to the case the First-tier Tribunal
decision continued under the heading "My findings". The judge noted that
the claim was based solely on the appellant's sur place activities. He
considered what was said by the previous First-tier Tribunal judge [22].
The judge set out the appellant's evidence about what happened when he was
arrested trying to leave the UK on a false passport [23-25].  He also set
out the appellant's evidence relating to his activities for the TGTE. He
went on to outline the appellant's evidence relating to his family life
with his wife and two children in the UK, who have been recognised as
refugees [24-26].

6.   The judge went on to set out the evidence given by the appellant's
wife as to the nature of their familial relationship [27].  He then
outlined the fact that the appellant suffered from mental health issues and
noted that the details were set out in a psychiatric report [28]. At [29]
the judge observed that there was a letter from the TGTE dated 23 July
2017, which confirmed that the appellant was an activist.  He noted the
Presenting Officer's submission that nobody from the TGTE attended the
hearing to give evidence, but then stated that he could place some weight
on the TGTE letter.  Although it seems clear that the judge considered the
letter, he did not explain why he placed weight on it.

7.   The only other place in which the judge made a finding was at [30],
where he said:

"The essential issue is whether the appellant is at real risk of
persecution or harm in Sri Lanka.  The country information report on Sri
Lanka identifies that 'there are reports of arrests and detentions, however
the scale and extent is difficult to quantify'.  I have considered the
categories of persons at risk as set out in GJ and Others (post civil-war:
returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC) and am satisfied that the
appellant could fall into a risk category as a person seeking to
destabilise the state through his sur place activities."

8.   The judge went on to state that as a result of his findings the
appellant was entitled to be granted asylum and therefore fell within an
exception to automatic deportation.  That was the extent of the findings
made by the judge in relation to the protection claim.

9.   The judge moved on to consider the human rights claim under Article 8
of the European Convention.  His findings were confined to three short
paragraphs at the end of the decision [32-34]. At [32] he found that the
appellant did not meet the exceptions to deportation contained in
paragraphs 399(a) or 399(b) of the immigration rules because his children
were not qualifying children and his relationship with his wife was formed
when his immigration status was precarious. The judge correctly went on to
say that if the appellant did not meet the exceptions to deportation that
the public interest in deportation could only be outweighed by other
factors if there were 'very compelling circumstances' over and above the
exceptions.

10.  When turning to look at the balancing exercise under paragraph 398 or
section 117C(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA
2002") the judge's findings were confined to the last two paragraphs of the
decision, as follows:

"33. I find that there are such very compelling circumstances in this case
namely, the appellant's extremely precarious mental health, his genuine and
subsisting parental relationship with his two children who are only 5� and
4� years old and that the appellant lives within a family unit with his
wife and two young children who have been granted asylum and are unable to
return to Sri Lanka.

34.  Section 117C of the 2002 Act (1) provides that the deportation of
foreign criminals is in the public interest and (2) the more serious the
offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater is the public interest
in deportation of the criminal.  It was accepted by Mr Armstrong on behalf
of the respondent, that the appellant's only criminal offence, for which he
was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, was not high on the scale of
criminal offending. The appellant is not a serious criminal or a danger to
the public."

Decision and reasons

11.  The Secretary of State appeals the First-tier Tribunal decision on two
grounds.  The same legal point is made in both.  It is asserted that the
judge failed to give adequate reasons for his decision. It is not suggested
that his conclusions were outside a range of reasonable responses to the
evidence, but of course it is important that a judge gives adequate reasons
so that those reading the decision can understand how and why he came to
the decision he did.

Ground 1 - protection claim

12.  On behalf of the appellant, Mr Haywood took us through the context in
which the case was considered, which included the fact that the appellant
was treated as a vulnerable witness and that none of the witnesses were
cross-examined. He said that it was open to the judge to make the findings
that he did under the heading "My findings" and that it was not necessary
for him to state on each occasion that he was making a finding. He referred
to various parts of the evidence which, he said, supported the judge's
apparent acceptance of the evidence relating to the appellant's activities
for the TGTE. In our assessment the findings said to have been made by the
judge at [22-28] amounted to nothing more than statements of the evidence.
It might be the case that the evidence was capable of being accepted.
However, if it was accepted, we are none the wiser as to why the judge
accepted the evidence, nor did the judge appear to address any of the
issues raised by the Secretary of State when coming to his conclusions. At
[29] the judge made a finding that he placed some weight on the letter from
the TGTE, but the decision leaves us none the wiser as to why he did so.

13.  Even if Mr Haywood's submissions were taken at their highest, we
consider that there are still problems relating to the judge's overall
conclusion at [30] regarding the application of the risk factors contained
in GJ.  It is not possible to discern (i) which particular risk category he
identified; or (ii) his reasons for concluding that the appellant fell into
that category. Some of the evidence before the judge might support the
appellant's claim to be at risk on return given that the TGTE is a
proscribed organisation (we note that this issue was not considered by the
Upper Tribunal in GJ), but we are unable to ascertain what evidence the
judge relied on in coming to his conclusion. We conclude that inadequate
reasons were given to explain the conclusions relating to the protection
claim.

Ground 2 - human rights claim

14.  Mr Haywood argued that the judge had regard to the relevant legal
framework relating to the assessment of Article 8. We accept that the judge
mentioned section 117C NIAA 2002 and was aware of the exceptions to
deportation contained in that provision, which are echoed in the
immigration rules. It was open to the judge to consider the various factors
he identified at [33]. What we find is missing from the assessment is any
explanation as to how or why the judge felt that those factors should be
given the kind of compelling weight required to outweigh the public
interest in deportation. The judge outlined relevant factors but failed to
explain how he evaluated them or why he considered them to be sufficiently
compelling.

15.  For these reasons, we conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision
    involved the making of an error of law. The nature and extent of the
    issues that will need to be remade are such that the parties agreed
    that it was necessary to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal for
    a fresh hearing before a different judge.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

The case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing
