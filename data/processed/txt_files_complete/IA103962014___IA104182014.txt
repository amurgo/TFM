                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by two  appellants,  Mr  Shahzada  Chowdhury  and  Mr
    Mohammad Amar Shahzad who are both citizens  of  Pakistan.   They  made
    joint applications for leave to remain as Tier  1  Entrepreneurs  under
    the points-based scheme, under paragraph 245DD(K).  Their  applications
    were refused by the Secretary of State on 7 February 2014.

2.    Their  appeals  were  dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Walters) on immigration grounds in a determination  promulgated  on  14
    October 2014.

Grounds
3.    The appellants submitted  grounds  for  permission  arguing  that  the
    Tribunal erred in its consideration of the Immigration rules which  the
    appellants met as regards funding issues.  They relied on  evidence  of
    funds (ï¿½50,000)  in  an  account  of  a  third  party  which  would  be
    transferred once leave was granted.  Further it  was  argued  that  the
    Tribunal failed to consider Article 8.

Permission
4.   Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox on 26  November
    2014.  He found all the grounds to be deficient in arguable merit  save
    for one.  He granted permission on the basis that  the  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to deal with Article 8.  He was unable  to  reach  any  view  on
    whether or not that error was material.

Hearing
5.   At the hearing before me the main ground pursued  by  Mrs  Ahammed  was
    that the Tribunal was wrong in its consideration and application of the
    Immigration Rules.  Notwithstanding  that  the  appellant  was  granted
    leave on one ground only in relation to Article 8, Mrs  Ahammed  sought
    to persuade me nevertheless that there were defects in  the  Tribunal's
    consideration under the Rules. Whilst she  did  not  formally  seek  to
    renew an application for permission on the first ground of appeal,  she
    wished for me to consider this ground nonetheless and she relied  on  a
    skeleton argument.  Thereafter she made submissions on Article  8  that
    there had been no proper consideration of the appellants private  lives
    and that the interference was not proportionate.  Mr Avery acknowledged
    that Article 8 was not addressed by the Tribunal but that this was  not
    material given the lack of evidence to support any  Article  8  private
    life claim.

Discussion and decision

6.   I find no material error of law in the decision made  by  the  Tribunal
    so far as the Immigration Rules are concerned.  As stated by Judge Cox,
    and with which I concur,  the  findings  [28]  and  assessment  by  the
    Tribunal are unassailable.  There was  insufficient  evidence  to  show
    that the appellants had access to the  funds  held  by  a  third  party
    and/or that the funds were genuinely available to the  appellants.  The
    Secretary of State relied on an interview conducted with the appellants
    (the replies are set out in the refusal letter at (ii))  and  which  in
    turn the Tribunal relied on. There was no submission or argument before
    me in respect of the second ground  regarding  the  business  plan.  In
    those circumstances I consider only the ground raised  that  Article  8
    was not dealt with.  It is certainly correct that  the  Tribunal  erred
    and failed specifically to deal with this issue although raised in  the
    grounds of appeal.  Nevertheless, I find there is no material error  of
    law.  The appellants rely on private life and their case is advanced on
    the  basis  of  length  of  residence  in  the  UK,  past   educational
    achievements, friends, contacts and their hope to set  up  business  in
    the UK. I am satisfied that there was no evidence relied  on  (or  been
    produced before this Tribunal) to establish any Article 8 case nor that
    Article 8 is engaged. The only material before the Tribunal related  to
    the application under the Immigration Rules. The appellants entered the
    UK in 2009 and remained as students and their applications for  further
    leave have not been successful.  They have lived for a short period  of
    time  in  the  UK  and  any  equivalent  private  life  can  easily  be
    established in Pakistan on return.  Accordingly I  dismiss  the  appeal
    and the determination shall stand.
