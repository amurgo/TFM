                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The  appellant,  a  citizen  of  Kosovo,  from  on  his  own  account
      Mitrovica, appeals the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr G Ashmore,
      who dismissed his appeal against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
      State, on 14 June 2002 to refuse his application for asylum.

2.    The appellant is  represented  before  us  by  Mr  J  Bruce  a  legal
      representative with Duncan Lewis & Company.  Mr C Trent  appears  for
      the Secretary of State.

3.    The Adjudicator it is fair to say, made negative credibility findings
      in respect of the appellant.  He did accept that  the  appellant  had
      suffered during the upheaval in Kosovo and that in 1999 his shop  had
      been burnt down and that his father had died on 5 June 1999.   He did
      not accept the appellant's account of having been  attacked  in  July
      2001 in his home in North Mitrovica on two occasions, nor that he had
      gone into hiding in February 2002.   The Adjudicator's  findings  are
      not supported with any degree of enthusiasm by Mr Trent  who  accepts
      that the Adjudicator's use of language in  particular  paragraphs  of
      the determination suggest the application of too higher  standard  of
      proof.  For example, in paragraph 9, the Adjudicator states that  the
      appellant would have had  no  difficulty  in  establishing  by  local
      records "or other incontrovertible documents" that he actually  lived
      in Mitrovica.   The Adjudicator's determination continues as follows:
      "A shop owner or proprietor I would have  expected  the  location  of
      these premises to be confirmed beyond question.   I am not  persuaded
      the appellant emanates from this area".

4.    Mr Trent submits that the  appellant  would  not  on  even  the  most
      benevolent interpretation of the facts in his  favour  be  unable  to
      benefit from a general sufficiency of protection in Kosovo in present
      circumstances.  Mr Trent's position is fortified by the fact that  in
      support of the appellant's claim Mr Bruce relied on  the  April  2002
      UNCHR position paper which lists protection categories  which  appear
      on page 20 of the appellant's bundles.  The position  paper  at  that
      stage was of the view that while most Kosovo Albanians were  able  to
      return without protection difficulties, certain categories of  Kosovo
      Albanians who might face serious problems included  Kosovo  Albanians
      originating from areas where they  constituted  an  ethnic  minority.
      Mr Bruce accepts that this category no longer appears  in  the  UNHCR
      position paper published in January 2003.

5.    Mr Trent in  his  submissions  drew  our  attention  to  the  Country
      Assessment which is in the appellant's bundle and  in  particular  to
      paragraphs 6.25 and 6.33.  In  the  latter  paragraph  the  Secretary
      General of the UN Security Council reported  on  17  July  2002  that
      "over the past few months a climate has been  created  that  for  the
      first time since the arrival of UNMIK appeared conducive to promoting
      inter-ethnic return".    This, the  assessment  states,  reflects  an
      increasing interest and commitment from UNMIK and  the  international
      community to address actively the situation of minorities and  return
      as a matter of priority.  In  paragraph  6.35  it  is  reported  that
      ethnic Albanian leaders at the  highest  level  including  the  Prime
      Minister  have  made  statements  in  favour  integration  and   non-
      discrimination.  The ex-KLA  leader  Hashim  Thaci  was  reported  as
      stating in the run-up to the October elections that  "the  return  of
      refugees did not endanger Kosovo. On the contrary, it stabilises  it,
      democratises  it  and  opens   immediate   prospects   for   Kosovo's
      independence".   In paragraph 6.25  it  is  stated  that  before  the
      conflict ethnic Albanians made up  over  90%  of  the  population  of
      Kosovo, the percentage is even higher now as large number of the Serb
      and Roma communities fled from Kosovo, those who remained are  mostly
      concentrated in mono ethnic areas.   In the  immediate  aftermath  of
      the war there was a very high level of violence  directed  at  ethnic
      minorities, Serbs and Roma in particular.   It is assumed  that  most
      perpetrators were ethnic Albanians seeking revenge  and  or  pursuing
      the aim of a wholly Albanian state.    But, the number  of  incidents
      it is stated in paragraph 6.26 of  violence  against  minorities  had
      decreased significantly with a notable improvement  in  the  security
      situation during the year 2001.

6.    The Adjudicator found that the appellant was an ordinary Albanian  in
      paragraph 22 of his determination.  Mr Bruce states that there is  no
      evidence that the appellant is other  than  in  good  health,  he  is
      comparatively young.   Mr Bruce is unable  to  take  us  to  material
      other than an out of date UNHCR position paper to indicate  that  the
      appellant would be at risk in  current  circumstances.    It  follows
      that he would not face persecutory treatment on return  in  our  view
      but, even if he was disinclined to re-settle in his  former  home  in
      north Mitrovica, we cannot find on the material  before  us  that  it
      could  possibly  be  described  as  unduly  harsh  for  him  to  live
      elsewhere, for example, in Pristina.  Mr Bruce has  taken  us  to  no
      material that would indicate that that would  be  so.    Accordingly,
      despite   the   admitted   imperfections   in    the    Adjudicator's
      determination, the Tribunal does not accept that the  United  Kingdom
      would be in breach of its international obligations by returning this
      appellant to Kosovo.  Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
