                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant is an Iraqi citizen of Kurdish ethnicity born  [~]  1997.
    He appealed against a decision of Judge O R Williams (the judge) of the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 30th April 2018.

 2. The Appellant claimed asylum on 18th  March  2015  and  his  claim  was
    refused on 5th August 2015.  His appeal was initially  heard  by  Judge
    Fox on 6th July 2016.  He was not found to be a  credible  witness  but
    his  appeal  was  allowed  to  the  limited  extent  that  it  remained
    outstanding before the Respondent to  reconsider  a  decision  made  in
    relation to the Appellant's age, and for the decision in AA  (Iraq)  CG
    [2015] UKUT 00544 (IAC) to be considered by the Respondent.

 3. The decision of Judge Fox was not appealed by  either  party,  and  the
    Respondent issued a fresh refusal decision  dated  7th  February  2018.
    The Appellant appealed against that refusal and his appeal was heard by
    the judge on 4th April 2018.  The judge took findings made by Judge Fox
    as his starting point and did not find the Appellant's  account  to  be
    credible.  The judge found that the Appellant is of  Kurdish  ethnicity
    and originates from Kirkuk.  The judge rejected his claim to be at risk
    from his family, and did not accept that he  was  a  genuine  Christian
    convert.

 4. The judge found that because Kirkuk is a contested area, the  Appellant
    could not return there and it would not be reasonable for the Appellant
    to internally relocate to Baghdad.  The judge found that the  Appellant
    did have a reasonable internal relocation option to the  Iraqi  Kurdish
    Region (the IKR).  The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

 5. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by Deputy Upper Tribunal
    Judge G A Black who found  it  arguable  that  the  judge  had  made  a
    material misdirection as to the application of Devaseelan [2002]  UKIAT
    00702, had failed to put material matters to the Appellant, and  failed
    to consider material issues in relation to return to the  IKR  and  the
    application of AA (Iraq) CG [2017] EWCA Civ 944.

Error of Law

 6. On 11th December 2018 I heard submissions from both parties in relation
    to error of law.  The Appellant relied upon three grounds.  I found  no
    error of law in relation to the first two grounds, but found  that  the
    judge had erred in relation to the third ground, which related  to  the
    country guidance decision of AA (Iraq) and whether the Appellant  would
    be able to obtain a CSID, and whether the Appellant  had  a  reasonable
    internal relocation option to the IKR.

 7. Full details of the application for permission to appeal, the grant  of
    permission, the submissions made by both parties and my conclusions and
    reasons are set out in my error of law  decision  dated  12th  December
    2018, promulgated on 18th December 2018.  I summarise below my  reasons
    for not finding an error of law in relation to the first  two  grounds,
    and for finding an error of law in relation to  the  third  ground  and
    setting aside the decision of the FtT.

 8. I did not find that the judge had erred in law in taking findings  made
    by  Judge  Fox  as  his  starting  point  pursuant  to  the  Devaseelan
    principles. The judge followed the correct legal approach.

 9. The second ground  contended  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  in
    describing the Appellant's account as lacking  in  detail  and  thereby
    attaching little weight to it.  It was submitted that the judge  failed
    to put the matters  he  found  vague  and  lacking  in  detail  to  the
    Appellant at the hearing, thereby committing a procedural irregularity.
     I found that the issues referred to by the judge at paragraph 38  were
    issues that should not have taken the Appellant  by  surprise  as  they
    were raised in the Respondent's refusal  decision  dated  7th  February
    2018 at paragraphs 47-55.  The refusal decision made it  clear  to  the
    Appellant why his account was not accepted.  It  was  then  up  to  the
    Appellant to address the issues raised in the refusal decision, and not
    for the judge hearing an appeal  "to  enter  the  arena"  and  commence
    questioning the Appellant.  The Appellant was aware of  the  issues  in
    the refusal decision and had every opportunity to address them, and the
    judge was entitled to find the Appellant had not discharged the  burden
    of proof upon him.

10. In relation to the third ground, I was persuaded  that  the  judge  had
    erred in law in his consideration of the Appellant's ability to  obtain
    a CSID.  I referred to AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ 944 and in  particular
    Annex C.  This confirms that regardless of the feasibility of return it
    is necessary to decide whether an Appellant has a CSID or will be  able
    to obtain one reasonably  soon  after  arrival  in  Iraq.   A  CSID  is
    generally required in order to access  financial  assistance  from  the
    authorities, employment, education, housing and medical treatment.   If
    the Appellant shows there are no family members likely to  be  able  to
    provide means of support, he is in general likely to face a  real  risk
    of destitution amounting to serious harm, if  by  the  time  any  funds
    provided by the Secretary of State to assist return had been exhausted,
    it is reasonably likely that the Appellant would still have no CSID.

11. If a return is feasible but an Appellant  does  not  have  a  CSID,  he
    should as a general matter be able to obtain one from the Civil  Status
    Affairs Office for his home governorate using an Iraqi passport  if  he
    has one.  If there is no passport, his ability to  obtain  a  CSID  may
    depend upon him knowing the page and volume number of the book  holding
    his family information.

12. An Appellant's ability to obtain  a  CSID  is  likely  to  be  severely
    hampered if he is unable to go to the CSA  Office  of  his  governorate
    because it is in an area where Article 15(c) serious harm is occurring.



13. With reference to the finding made by  the  judge  that  the  Appellant
    could approach the Iraqi Embassy in the UK, this is dealt  with  in  AA
    (Iraq) CG [2015] UKUT  544  (IAC)  commencing  at  paragraph  173.   At
    paragraph 174 an expert witness explains that if an individual had lost
    his CSID (as the Appellant claims to have done) and does not  know  the
    relevant page and book number for it, then the Iraqi Embassy in  London
    will not be able to obtain one  on  his  behalf.   The  judge  did  not
    adequately explain how the Appellant's family in Iraq would be able  to
    assist him if they are  in  Kirkuk  which  the  judge  found  to  be  a
    contested area.

14. I concluded that the  judge  had  not  provided  adequate  reasons  for
    finding that the Appellant would be able to obtain a CSID either in the
    UK or shortly after arrival in Iraq.  This was  the  one  area  of  the
    judge's decision where I found an error of law.  I found the  error  to
    be material and therefore set aside the decision,  but  maintained  the
    credibility findings which had been unsuccessfully challenged.

Re-making the Decision

15. At the resumed hearing Mr Greer indicated that although  the  Appellant
    had submitted a further witness statement dated 26th February 2019,  it
    was accepted that this appeared  to  attempt  to  contradict  preserved
    findings, and therefore would not be  relied  upon  and  the  Appellant
    would not be called to give evidence.

16. No further documentary evidence had been submitted which had  not  been
    before the FtT.  Mr McVeety indicated that the Respondent has issued  a
    new Country Policy and Information Note in February 2019,  but  he  did
    not seek to introduce this document for the purposes of this hearing.

17. Mr Greer indicated that no skeleton argument  had  been  prepared,  and
    therefore suggested that he commence by  making  oral  submissions,  so
    that Mr McVeety could respond to those submissions.

18. Mr Greer submitted that it was accepted that  the  Appellant  does  not
    have a CSID.  This is a Civil Status  Identity  Card.   The  Respondent
    conceded this at paragraph  117  of  the  refusal  decision  dated  7th
    February 2018.  It was not disputed that the Appellant had been  issued
    with a CSID, but as explained in his witness statement dated 14th March
    2016, he had lost this when he lost his  bag  travelling  in  Slovakia.
    The Appellant had not been issued with a nationality certificate.

19. The Respondent accepted in the refusal decision at paragraph  117  that
    because Kirkuk is the Appellant's home area and is a contested area, he
    would be unable to visit the CSA Office in Kirkuk and it was  contended
    that he would have to apply for formal recognition of his identity  via
    the National Status Court in Baghdad.

20. Mr Greer referred to paragraph 187 of AA (Iraq) [2015] in which  it  is
    stated that evidence does not demonstrate that  the  "Central  Archive"
    which exists in Baghdad is in practice able to provide CSIDs  to  those
    in need of them.  The operation of the National Status Court in Baghdad
    is described as unclear.

21. I was therefore asked to find that the Appellant would not be  able  to
    return to Kirkuk to obtain a CSID, and would not be able to obtain  one
    in Baghdad.  It was also submitted that the Appellant would not be able
    to obtain a replacement CSID  in  the  UK.   On  this  point  Mr  Greer
    referred to Annex C of AA (Iraq) [2017] and in particular paragraphs 10-
    11.  The Appellant does not have a passport, and does not know the page
    and volume number of the book  holding  his  family  information.   The
    Appellant does not have family members or other individuals  who  would
    be able to attend a CSA Office on his behalf.  It  was  submitted  that
    the Appellant would not be able to obtain a CSID while in the  UK,  and
    therefore would be returned without a CSID which would put him at  risk
    of Article 3 ill-treatment.

22. If it was found that the  Appellant  could  obtain  a  CSID,  Mr  Greer
    submitted that he would still not have a reasonable internal relocation
    option to the IKR.  There is a 70% unemployment rate in  the  IKR,  and
    the Appellant has no relatives in the IKR who  could  assist  him.   He
    would be disadvantaged, coming from a previously contested region.

23. It was therefore submitted that the appeal should be  allowed,  not  on
    asylum grounds, but in relation to humanitarian protection and  Article
    3.

24. I then heard oral submissions from Mr McVeety who pointed out that  the
    judge had found the Appellant not to be a credible witness.  The  judge
    had found that the Appellant was in touch with his family.  Mr  McVeety
    submitted that it was important to remember that the  judge  had  found
    that the Appellant was not a witness of truth.  I was reminded that the
    Appellant's family had been in Kirkuk and had been  able  to  help  him
    leave Iraq, according to the Appellant's account.

25. Mr McVeety referred to AAH (Iraq) CG UKUT 00212  (IAC)  and  head  note
    1(ii) which relates to the location  of  the  relevant  Civil  Registry
    Office, and whether it is in an area held, or formerly  held  by  ISIS,
    and whether it is operational.  Mr McVeety pointed out that Kirkuk  had
    not been controlled by ISIS, is presently not controlled by  ISIS,  and
    there was no evidence to indicate that the CSA Office in Kirkuk was not
    operational.

26. Mr McVeety submitted that while it had been found  that  the  Appellant
    could not return to Kirkuk, his family were in  that  city,  and  could
    attend the CSA Office, and arrange for a replacement CSID  to  be  sent
    from Iraq.

27. Alternatively, the Appellant could approach the National  Status  Court
    in Baghdad.  It was submitted  that  the  Appellant  has  a  reasonable
    internal relocation option to the IKR.   He  is  in  contact  with  his
    family.  He would receive funds from the Voluntary Returns Scheme.  The
    Appellant would not be disadvantaged because he would not  be  regarded
    as coming from an area previously controlled by ISIS, as ISIS  had  not
    controlled Kirkuk, and in any event he would be returning from the UK.

28. In responding to Mr McVeety, Mr Greer pointed out that the  Appellant's
    case was that he had lived with his mother and had no contact with  his
    father, and at paragraph 1(iii) of the head note to AAH,  the  question
    was posed whether there would be any male family members who  would  be
    able and willing to attend the Civil Registry with  the  Appellant,  as
    the registration  system  is  patrilineal,  it  would  be  relevant  to
    consider whether the relative is from the mother or father's side.

29. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

30.  It was not submitted that the Appellant was entitled  to  a  grant  of
    asylum, but was entitled to a grant of humanitarian protection, and  to
    return him to Iraq would breach Article 3.  The burden of proof  is  on
    the Appellant, to the lower standard, that being a reasonable degree of
    likelihood.

31. I am considering this appeal, based on preserved findings made  by  the
    FtT.  Those are summarised  at  paragraphs  43-47  which  for  ease  of
    reference I set out below;

         "43. I must assess the evidence as a whole  in  the  light  of  the
             relatively low standard of proof.   I  have  to  look  at  the
             evidence in the round [44-47].

         44.  For the reasons given above, I find that the Appellant  is  an
             Iraqi national, to be a Kurd from Kirkuk.

         45.  For the reasons given above, I find that the Appellant  is  of
             no  specific  ongoing  adverse  interest  to  his   father/any
             actor/ISIS,  but  left  Iraq  due  to  the  general   security
             situation prevailing at that time.

         46.  For the reasons given above,  I  am  satisfied  the  Appellant
             remains in contact with his family in Iraq.

         47.  For the reasons given above,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
             Appellant is at any risk as a  consequence  of  any  Christian
             activities."

32. Another preserved finding made by the FtT, is  that  Kirkuk  remains  a
    contested region.  This was  not  challenged  by  the  Respondent.   An
    accepted fact is that the Appellant previously held a CSID.  There  was
    no challenge to his evidence that he lost this in Slovakia.

33. I find that the CSID would have been issued in Kirkuk as that is  where
    the Appellant and his family lived.

34. I find that there is no evidence to indicate that  the  CSA  Office  in
    Kirkuk is not operational.  Annex C  of  AA  (Iraq)  [2017]  refers  to
    alternative CSA Offices which were set  up  for  areas  where  the  CSA
    Offices were not operational,  those  areas  being  Mosul,  Anber,  and
    Saluhaddin.  There was no alternative office set up for  Kirkuk,  which
    indicates the Kirkuk office remained operational.

35. The Respondent has accepted that the Appellant cannot return to Kirkuk.
     I must consider whether the Appellant could obtain a CSID while in the
    UK.  Expert evidence was given on this issue to the Upper  Tribunal  in
    AA (Iraq) [2015], by Dr Fatah, who also  gave  evidence  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal in AAH.  Dr Fatah confirmed that  the  guidance  given  in  AA
    (Iraq) [2015] remains accurate but added two caveats.  Firstly, it must
    be recognised that the Iraqi civil registration system is in  disarray.
    Between 2014 and 2017 ISIS closed down all of the relevant  offices  in
    areas under its control, damaging  or  destroying  many  of  them.   No
    marriages, births or deaths were recorded in these offices during  that
    period and officials today are preoccupied with trying to register  and
    re-document many hundreds of thousands of people in need of  assistance
    in Iraq.

36. Secondly, the anecdotal evidence on the  willingness  of  officials  to
    assist undocumented IDPs is not promising.

37. The evaluation of whether there is  a  reasonable  likelihood  that  an
    applicant will not be able to obtain a new CSID either directly  or  by
    way of proxy, must be assessed  against  that  background.   Whilst  it
    remains possible for an undocumented returnee to  obtain  a  new  CSID,
    whether he is able to do so, or do so within a  reasonable  time  frame
    will depend on his individual circumstances.

38. Dr Fatah explained at paragraph 177 of AA (Iraq) [2015] that  an  Iraqi
    national living in the UK could obtain  a  CSID  through  the  consular
    section of the Iraqi Embassy in London if able to produce a current  or
    expired passport and/or the book  and  page  number  for  their  family
    registration details. For persons without such a passport  or  who  are
    unable to produce the relevant family registration details, such as the
    Appellant, a power of attorney can be provided to someone in  Iraq  who
    can thereafter undertake the process of obtaining the CSID from the CSA
    Office in their home governorate.  At the present time the  process  of
    obtaining a CSID from Iraq is likely to be  severely  hampered  if  the
    person wishing to obtain it is from an area where Article 15(c) serious
    harm is occurring.

39. Dr Fatah indicated that an individual in the UK would  either  have  to
    attend the appropriate local office of family registration in  Iraq  or
    give a relative, friend or lawyer power of attorney to obtain the CSID.
     Dr Fatah described the process of giving a  power  of  attorney  to  a
    lawyer in Iraq to act as a proxy as commonplace and Dr Fatah  had  done
    this himself.  The power of attorney could be obtained through the Iraq
    Embassy.  The CSID could then be obtained  at  the  appropriate  office
    which in the Appellant's case would be Kirkuk, and sent  from  Iraq  to
    the UK.  It may have to be sent to the Iraqi Embassy.

40. I must take into account the finding that the Appellant is  in  contact
    with his family in Iraq as his evidence to the contrary on  that  point
    was disbelieved by the judge.  His family  were  in  Kirkuk.   The  CSA
    Office is operational in Kirkuk, and  the  Appellant  could  appoint  a
    member of his family, or a lawyer who is already in Kirkuk,  to  attend
    the office to obtain a replacement CSID and arrange for that to be sent
    to the UK.

41. I therefore conclude that the Appellant could obtain a CSID while still
    in the UK.

42. If a CSID was obtained, the Appellant would be returned to Baghdad.  It
    is confirmed in AAH that a returnee of Kurdish origin in possession  of
    a valid CSID could make the journey from Baghdad to the IKR, whether by
    air or land without a real risk of suffering persecution, serious harm,
    Article 3 ill-treatment, nor would any difficulties on the journey make
    relocation unduly harsh.  The journey is described  as  affordable  and
    practical.

43. At the IKR border a Kurdish citizen would  normally  be  granted  entry
    subject to security screening and registering presence with  the  local
    mukhtar, the individual would be permitted to enter and reside  in  the
    IKR with no further legal impediments or  requirements.   There  is  no
    sponsorship requirement for Kurds.

44. Additional factors that may increase risk would not in my opinion apply
    in this case.  The Appellant does not come from a family with  a  known
    association with ISIS, nor does he come from an  area  associated  with
    ISIS.  While he is a single male of fighting age, the  Appellant  would
    be able to provide evidence that he had recently arrived from  the  UK,
    which would dispel any suggestion of having arrived  directly  from  an
    ISIS territory.

45. There is no evidence that the Appellant has family  members  living  in
    the IKR.  Therefore, accommodation options would be limited.   However,
    the Appellant would have access to �1,500 under the  Voluntary  Returns
    Scheme.  I find that the  Appellant  would  also  be  able  to  receive
    support from his family.  His case was that he was able  to  travel  to
    the UK because one of his uncles funded the journey.

46. Although the unemployment rate is high,  the  Appellant  would  have  a
    CSID, and therefore would be eligible to look  for  employment.   Taken
    together with the grant of �1,500, and support from his  family,  I  do
    not find that the Appellant would be destitute,  and  I  find  that  he
    would have a reasonable internal  relocation  option  within  the  IKR.
    There are no relevant medical issues, and there would be no risk within
    the IKR, and there would be no language or cultural difficulties.

47. In conclusion, I do not find that the Appellant is entitled to a  grant
    of asylum, or humanitarian protection, and there would be no breach  of
    Articles 2 or 3 of the 1950 Convention.  This is because the  Appellant
    has a reasonable internal relocation option to the IKR.  Article 8  was
    not argued before me.  For the avoidance  of  doubt  I  find  that  the
    Appellant has not established a family life in the UK that would engage
    Article 8.  He has established a private life since his arrival.  He is
    not eligible to rely upon paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) because he was not 18
    years of age at the date of application, which  was  18th  March  2015.
    The Appellant attained the age of 18 years on 1st April 2015.   In  any
    event, the evidence does not  demonstrate  that  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to his integration into Iraq.

48. I do not find any  exceptional  circumstances  which  would  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences if the  Appellant  had  to  return  to
    Iraq.  I have taken into account the considerations in section 117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control is in the public interest.  It is in  the
    public interest that a person seeking leave to remain can speak English
    and is financially independent.  I accept that the Appellant is able to
    speak some English, but he is  not  financially  independent.   I  must
    attach little weight to a private life established when  a  person  has
    been in the UK with a precarious immigration status, which  applies  to
    the Appellant.

49. With reference to Article 8, I find that the weight to be  attached  to
    the public  interest  in  maintaining  effective  immigration  control,
    outweighs the weight to be attached to the wishes of the  Appellant  to
    remain in the UK.





Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law and is set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
