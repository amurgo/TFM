                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the appellant against a Decision  and  Reasons  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Devittie),  who  dismissed  the  appeal
    against the refusal for leave to remain  on  family  and  private  life
    grounds under the Immigration Rules and human rights.

2.   The grounds in support of the  application  were  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to consider the interests of the appellant, her British
    citizen  child  and  British  citizen  partner  and  the  existence  of
    insurmountable obstacles on return to the Philippines.

3.   Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth  on  4
    February 2016 who found arguable grounds in the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    failure to consider public  interest  under  Section  117  Nationality,
    Immigration & asylum Act 2002 (as amended), where the partner and child
    are British citizens.

4.    In a Rule 24 response dated 3 March 2016 the application  was  opposed
    by the Secretary of State contending that the balance of  interests  as
    between the state and the appellant had carefully  been  considered  by
    the Tribunal and no insurmountable obstacles were found.

5.   This morning Mr Clarke on behalf of the Secretary of  State  Mr  Clarke
    conceded that the Secretary of State failed  to  consider  the  British
    citizen child and that this  amounted to a decision  that  was  not  in
    accordance  with   the   law   (AG   &   other   (policies;   executive
    discretions;Tribunal's powers) Kosovo [2007] UKAIT 00082).  He  further
    conceded that this rendered the Tribunal's decision an error of law and
    in terms of its failure  to  apply  the  Secretary  of  State's  policy
    guidance that there is no expectation  that  a  British  citizen  child
    should have to leave the UK, as set out in statutory form under section
    117B(6) Nationality, Immigration & asylum Act 2002 (as amended).

Decision & reasons

6.   The First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    financial requirements under the Rules and went on to consider EX1. The
    First -tier  Tribunal  found  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
    between the appellant and her partner who was  a  British  citizen.  It
    found that although there would  be  difficulties  there  would  be  no
    insurmountable obstacles to living in the Philippines.   The  appellant
    was born and raised there and could be expected to rely on support from
    her family members settled in the UK.  The First -tier Tribunal went on
    to consider Article 8 outside of the Rules and concluded that the  best
    interests of the child were to remain with both parents in the  UK  [12
    &14].  It then considered proportionality and looked at the question of
    public interest considerations.

6.   The First-tier Tribunal made no specific reference to  Section  117  of
    the 2002 Act (as  amended)  as  regards  public  interest  factors  but
    considered  some  of  the  issues  that  arise  under  those  statutory
    provisions.

7.   However,  of significance was its failure to consider  or  address  the
    public interest in   removal of a British citizen child  under  section
    117B(6). That provision states that there  is  no  public  interest  in
    removal of a British citizen child. On that basis I am  satisfied  that
    there is a material error of law in  the  decision  and  reasons  which
    shall be set aside.

8.    Both representatives confirmed that in terms of disposal there was  no
    need for further hearing or submissions.  The facts found by the  Firt-
    tier tribunal were not challenged. There is no public interest  in  the
    removal of a  British  citizen  child  (Treebhawon  &  others  (section
    117B(6) [2015]  UKUAT  674  (IAC).   Accordingly  I  allow  the  appeal
    outright.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have  decided  to  make  a  no  fee
award of ï¿½40.00. A hearing was needed to consider the issues.
