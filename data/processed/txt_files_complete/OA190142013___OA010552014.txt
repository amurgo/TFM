Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr T Khan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Somal issued  on
    10th November 2014 allowing under the Immigration Rules  and  on  human
    rights grounds the Appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent made on 27th September 2013 to refuse leave to enter the  UK
    as the wife and daughter of a person present and settled in the UK.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Denson on
    7th January 2015.  Judge Denson said:

         "2.  The Respondent seeks permission to appeal on the basis that it
             is unclear, based on the determination,  that  the  Appellants
             were able to demonstrate that as at the  relevant  date  their
             United Kingdom Sponsor was earning the  requisite  income  and
             that they complied with the provisions of Appendix FM-SE.   In
             addition the Respondent submitted that there was a paucity  of
             evidence  before  the  Judge  to  demonstrate   a   subsisting
             relationship between the first Appellant and her  husband  and
             it was not clear what corroborative evidence the  Judge  (had)
             missing on the subsistence of  the  relationship  between  the
             parties.

         3.   The Judge in paragraph 12 of the determination  made  findings
             that the Appellants' Sponsor through both his employers earned
             over the required sum of �22,400 gross per annum, however,  it
             was not clear how this assessment was made, bearing  in  mind,
             although stated that a P60 had been produced, a  copy  of  the
             same is  not  in  the  Appellants'  or  Respondent's  bundles.
             Furthermore the bank statements show that the Sponsor  in  the
             second employment  received  no  further  payments  from  such
             employment  after  13th  June  2013  and  therefore  there  is
             insufficient evidence to show that the Appellants  could  meet
             the relevant Immigration Rules as regards to  the  maintenance
             requirements.

         4.   The Judge in her determination made findings that the marriage
             was genuine and subsisting, this was based on  the  fact  that
             copies of the Sponsor's passport were produced at the  hearing
             together  with  an  English  translation   of   the   marriage
             certificate and the DNA test results which clearly showed  the
             relationship between the Sponsor and the Appellants  and  that
             the findings in the determination that there was a genuine and
             subsisting relationship are utterly sustainable.

         5.   Due to the lack of evidence produced at the hearing as regards
             to whether  or  not  the  Appellants  could  comply  with  the
             relevant Immigration  Rules  as  regards  to  the  maintenance
             requirements as at the date of the decision I find that  there
             is an arguable error  of  law  and  permission  to  appeal  is
             therefore granted."

 3. The submissions in the grounds seeking leave to appeal say with  regard
    to the financial requirements that it is unclear  that  the  Appellants
    are able to demonstrate that the  Sponsor  was  earning  the  requisite
    income.  He could only demonstrate an income of �19,232.  The  ECO  had
    not made a final decision on this due to the pending  Court  of  Appeal
    decision in MM and the point made in the grounds is that it would  have
    been appropriate to remit  the  matter  back  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer on the financial points so that the evidence could be  properly
    appraised.  There are submissions about the findings on the genuineness
    and subsistence of the marriage and complaints about the  DNA  evidence
    provided but I am not going to deal with this  because  permission  was
    not granted on that point and it seems to me that the  evidence  before
    the Judge was satisfactory.  It is submitted that the decision to allow
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds is  fundamentally  flawed  because  the
    status quo can be reasonably maintained,   Section 117B of the 2002 Act
    has not been dealt with properly and the Judge has not engaged properly
    with Article 8.

 4. Judge Somal found that the requirements of Appendix FM  were  met.   He
    noted that the wage slips submitted by the Sponsor for one job showed a
    gross salary for the appropriate period of �19,232.  The Sponsor had to
    show a gross income of �22,400 to comply with the Rules.   The  Sponsor
    said he had two jobs but he had only been in the second  job  for  five
    months and so could only show five months' income.  This was  shown  to
    be �6,699 gross.  This was confirmed by a P60.  The  Judge  noted  that
    the Appellant had provided payslips, P60s and bank  statements  showing
    credits from his employers which  show  he  earned  over  the  required
    �22,400 gross per annum at the date of application.   The  Judge  found
    that he does meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.   It  seems  that
    the Judge carefully checked these figures and that they are documented.
     What is said in  the  grounds  seeking  permission  is  that  the  ECO
    contends that it is unclear,  based  on  the  determination,  that  the
    Appellants are able to demonstrate that as at  the  relevant  date  the
    Sponsor was earning the requisite income but I do not see  that  it  is
    unclear from the determination.  It is indeed very clear.  The P60  for
    his second job is in the bundle of papers and was issued for  the  year
    to April 2013, the decision having been made  in  September  2013.  The
    Appellant provided with  the  application  the  documents  required  by
    Appendix FM-SE.

 5. I find therefore that the  Appellant  does  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM and FM-SE and  I  find  that  the  determination  does  not
    contain a material error of law in relation to the Immigration Rules.

 6. I do agree that the assessment of Article 8 and  of  interference  with
    the family life of the Appellants is  inadequate  and  that  no  proper
    assessment of proportionality has been made.   It  appears  that  Judge
    Somal allowed the appeal solely on the basis that  the  Appellants  are
    the wife and daughter of the Sponsor who is living in the UK  and  this
    is in this case not sufficient and certainly would not have been if the
    Appellant failed to meet the requirements of the  Rules.   I  therefore
    set aside the finding that the Appellants are entitled to remain in the
    UK on Article 8 grounds.  In practical terms this makes  no  difference
    because  I  find  that  the  appeal  was  properly  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

I find that there is no material error of law in the findings of the  First-
tier Tribunal as they relate to the Immigration Rules and  that  the  appeal
of the Appellants against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  was  properly
allowed.  That decision  shall  stand.   I  set  aside  the  findings  under
Article 8 ECHR.

No anonymity direction is made.
