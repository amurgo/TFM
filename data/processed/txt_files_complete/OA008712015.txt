                              RUPENI TUIMAVANA
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr B Price, Latta & Co Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above, but the rest of this  determination
    refers to them as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Fiji, born on 11 September 1969.   On  10
    September 2014 he sought entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM
    of the Immigration Rules, based on his marriage to Barbara  Scott,  the
    sponsor, a UK citizen.

 3. The respondent refused the  application  for  reasons  explained  in  a
    notice dated 21 November 2014, which in summary were as follows:

      . failure to disclose a conviction on 3  December  2002  at  Aberdeen
        District Court;

      . failure to meet the income threshold, the sponsor not  having  been
        in employment at the date of application, not  employed  within  28
        days of the application, and not having a current job offer;

      . savings less than the amount required to count against  the  income
        threshold;

      . evidence of the English  language  requirement  falling  below  the
        level required; and

      . no circumstances to warrant the  application  being  granted  under
        Article 8 of ECHR, outwith the Immigration Rules.

 4. The appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a  decision
    promulgated on 23 October 2015 Judge David C  Clapham  found  that  the
    English language requirement was met (which is no longer in dispute, at
    least in these proceedings); that the income requirements of the  Rules
    were met, and that the Entry Clearance Officer should have  "applied  a
    policy of evidential flexibility" to enable the  appellant  to  provide
    the necessary further documentation; but that  unfortunately  the  non-
    disclosure of the conviction  was  such  that  the  appeal  should  not
    succeed under the Rules.

 5. On Article 8, the judge said that if the appellant were now to apply he
    would meet the financial requirements of the Rules, due to funds  which
    the sponsor had since acquired by way of inheritance; that the criminal
    conviction  was  minor  and  should  not   disqualify   the   appellant
    permanently from being able to live  in  the  UK;  that  the  sponsor's
    health difficulties might not be adequately managed in Fiji "because of
    the  difficulties  with  the  health  system  there"  (an   unexplained
    conclusion); that there was no "strict  test  of  exceptionality";  and
    that "looking at ... Article 8 through  the  lens  of  the  Immigration
    Rules ... the financial requirements  are  satisfied  and  the  English
    language requirements are satisfied ... the conviction ... is  not  one
    to which I would have attached particularly serious  weight  ...  there
    are ... compelling circumstances ... in terms of the  sponsor's  health
    and financial circumstances ... " such as to justify the  appeal  being
    allowed under Article 8.

 6. The ECO's refusal is accurately and specifically justified by reference
    to the Rules.  Unfortunately, proceedings between then and the  hearing
    in the Upper Tribunal were conducted with little if any such reference.
     In some respects the judge does not  appear  to  have  the  assistance
    which he ought to have had by way of submissions,  including  those  on
    behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer.   The  grounds  of  appeal  and
    submissions on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  succeed  in
    identifying material errors in the judge's decision.   The  errors,  on
    being taken to the terms of the Immigration Rules, are plain.

 7. There is no scheme of "evidential flexibility"  within  the  Rules,  or
    anywhere else, which applies to cases of this nature.  The  grounds  of
    appeal and submissions for the appellant  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    should not have relied upon this vague and non-existent concept.

 8. The  Rules  at  Appendix  FM  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1(a)(i)  required  the
    applicant to show from specified evidence a gross annual income  of  at
    least  ï¿½18,600.   Appendix  FM-SE  at  paragraph  A1(l)  required   the
    specified evidence, or the most recently  dated  part  thereof,  to  be
    dated no earlier than 28 days before the date of application.

 9. Mr Matthews accepted that the FtT was not restricted  to  the  evidence
    which was before the Entry Clearance Officer; but more importantly, the
    evidence does have to relate to the  date  of  decision  under  appeal.
    There was no answer to the point that even on evidence later  produced,
    the appellant was not in employment after June 2014,  and  was  not  in
    employment at the date of application.

10. Had the judge been directed by representatives to the relevant parts of
    the Rules, it  would  have  been  readily  apparent  that  neither  the
    evidence presented with the application nor the evidence  available  at
    the date of the hearing  came  close  to  showing  that  the  financial
    requirements could be met (in relation to  the  application  which  was
    appealed).

11. In passing, I would not have been inclined to hold that either the non-
    disclosure or the existence of the criminal conviction ought to be held
    against the appellant, at any stage.  This is not a mandatory ground of
    refusal, but a question of discretion.  The conviction is old.  It took
    place in the lowest level of the criminal courts, and attracted neither
    a prison sentence nor a fine.  If any  criminal  conviction  is  to  be
    disregarded, this is it.  The Presenting Officer  did  not  concede  as
    much, but did not strenuously pursue the point either.  The judge found
    this to be a point which could be overlooked in striking the Article  8
    balance.  I would have little difficulty in reaching the same  view  in
    relation to the discretion which exists within the Rules.

12. The judge's findings in favour of  the  appellant  in  respect  of  the
    financial requirements did not lead to the appeal being  allowed  under
    the Immigration Rules, but  they  played  a  significant  part  in  the
    decision to allow the appeal under Article 8 (paragraph 38).  Thus, the
    Article 8 decision was reached on an incorrect basis, and falls  to  be
    set aside.

13. There is another error in  the  Article  8  decision.   The  judge  was
    strongly influenced by his view that if the appellant were  to  make  a
    further application for entry clearance, he would  meet  the  financial
    requirements (see paragraph 32).  It was part of the submission for the
    appellant that the judge was correct to take this as a point in  favour
    of allowing the appeal.  However, the reverse applies.  The fact that a
    party might make a successful application under the Rules is  a  reason
    for dismissing an appeal in terms of Article 8, not  for  allowing  it.
    It cannot be a disproportionate interference with family life to expect
    an appellant to make a  further  application  in  accordance  with  the
    Rules.

14. This decision and the FtT decision are not to be read  together  as  an
    indication that a further application made by the appellant is bound to
    succeed.  Any such application will be decided on its own merits at the
    time.  However, on the facts as  they  appeared  at  the  time  of  the
    hearing both in the FtT and in the UT, it does seem that the  applicant
    may be in quite a strong position to apply.  Any future  decision  will
    no doubt bear in mind the observations made in the FtT and in the UT on
    the age and relative insignificance of the criminal conviction.

15. The Immigration Rules and in particular the family life and  evidential
    requirements of Appendix FM and FM-SE are highly prescriptive, detailed
    and  no  doubt  often  quite  baffling  to  appellants  and   sponsors,
    particularly at times when they  do  not  have  the  benefit  of  legal
    advice.  However, tribunals have to apply the Rules as they stand;  and
    beyond  the  Rules,  Article  8  of  the  ECHR  is  for  protection  of
    individuals against serious breaches of fundamental human rights, not a
    shortcut to bypass the Rules.

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside.   The  following
    decision is substituted: the  appeal,  as  brought  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, is dismissed both under the Immigration Rules  and  on  human
    rights grounds.
