    Representation:
    For the Appellant: Mr Palmer, Counsel, instructed by Simons Rodkin
    Solicitors
    For the Respondent:     Mr Walker (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, citizen of Sri Lanka, was born on December 22, 1984.  On
    September 15, 2007 the  appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    student using her own passport. This visa expired on October  31,  2010
    but she made an application on August 21, 2009  for  a  certificate  of
    approval for marriage and this was granted on September  24,  2009.  On
    October 28, 2010 she submitted an  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 student but this was refused on December  17,  2010.
    She appealed this decision but later withdrew this appeal  on  February
    24, 2011 having applied for asylum on February 11, 2011. The respondent
    refused this application on April 7, 2011 and served her with a removal
    direction.

 2. On May 10, 2013 the Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under
    Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (hereinafter
    called the 2002 Act), as amended. The matter came before Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Hussain (hereinafter called "the FtTJ") on July 18,
    2011 and he refused the appeal after an oral hearing in a determination
    promulgated on August 12, 2011.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on August 31,  2011.  Permission
    to appeal was refused by former Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Kebede
    on September 12, 2011.  The grounds of appeal were renewed to the Upper
    Tribunal  but  Senior  Immigration  Judge  Warr   refused   permission.
    Permission was  sought  to  judicially  review  that  decision  and  on
    September 20, 2012 the Honourable Mr Justice Blake  refused  permission
    on the papers. A full hearing was sought and on January  31,  2013  HHJ
    Anthony Thornton QC granted permission to apply for judicial review  on
    the basis there was some other compelling reason for a  review  of  the
    Upper Tribunal decision. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Jordan  considered  the
    matter on March 14, 2014 and permission to appeal.

 4. The matter came before me on the date set out above. The appellant  was
    in attendance and represented by his counsel.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 5. Mr Walker acknowledged the decision of  the  Administrative  Court  and
    accepted the consultant's report had not been considered. Whilst  there
    were other credibility findings he  accepted  that  the  FtTJ  had  not
    demonstrated he had considered this evidence and it  may  have  made  a
    difference to his overall assessment and findings.

 6. In the circumstances I was left with no alternative but to  find  there
    had been an error in law on the basis that the FtTJ had failed to  have
    regard  to  material  evidence  that  may  have  affected  his  overall
    credibility assessments.

 7. Having established there was an error in law I invited  submissions  on
    what should happen to the appeal.  Both  representatives  agreed  fresh
    oral evidence and findings would be necessary.  I  considered  Part  3,
    Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement.

 8. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or


          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.


         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


 9. In light of the Practice Direction I agreed the case should be remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard on all matters.

10. I informed Mr Palmer that his instructing solicitors should file a  new
    bundle that would replace anything else that had hitherto been filed.

11. The parties should ensure compliance  with  any  directions  issued  in
    light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier   Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 would apply to this  appeal
    from hereon.

    Decision


12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

13. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

14. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. An
    order has been made and no application  has  been  made  to  alter  the
    position.
