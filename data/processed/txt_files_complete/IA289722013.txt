For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless for the purposes of this  determination  I  shall
    refer to the parties as they  were  described  before  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal.

 2. On  8th  July  2014  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  McDade  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal against the refusal, dated 12th  February  2013,  by
    the Secretary of State, to grant the appellant's application dated 22nd
    October 2012 for a Tier 4 (general)  Student  Migrant  visa  under  the
    points based system (paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules).

 3. Essentially the appellant had submitted an original Lloyd's bank letter
    dated 15th October 2012 confirming that the appellant had the  required
    funds (�2,000 as stated in the Secretary of State's refusal letter) for
    the period  11th  September  2012  to  11th  October  2012.   His  bank
    statement, which he also submitted, from Lloyd's Bank  showed  that  on
    12th October 2012 (one day later) his balance had dropped to  �1532.45.
    Judge McDade allowed the appeal on the basis of the bank letter.

 4. This was challenged by the respondent citing that  Paragraph  1A(h)  of
    the Rules states that 'the end date of the 90-day  and  28-day  periods
    referred to in (b) and (c) above will be  taken  as  the  date  of  the
    closing balance on the most recent of the  specified  documents  (where
    specified documents from two or more accounts are submitted, this  will
    be the end date fro the account that most favours  the  applicant)  and
    must be no earlier than 31 days  before the date of application'.

 5. The respondent argued that the date should be taken from  the  date  of
    the bank statement as this was the most recent closing balance  on  the
    most recent specified document.

 6. I pointed out at the appeal that the rule  does  not  state  'the  most
    recent closing balance'  but  the  'most  recent  specified  document'.
    There is a difference.  The bank letter post dates the  bank  statement
    and is the most recent specified document as  set  out  in  Appendix  C
    paragraph 1B(c) which confirms that a bank letter, in the relevant form
    can suffice.  The bank letter confirmed that  the  appellant's  account
    had not dropped below �2,000 for a 28 day period ending on 11th October
    2012.  The bank statement was not the most  recent  specified  document
    even though it showed the balance  one  day  later  at  �1,532.45.   Mr
    Shilliday conceded  that  a  careful  reading  of  the  Rules  led  the
    appellant to success.

 7. Although there was a challenge to the reasoning given by  Judge  McDade
    in his determination, and there was no explanation  of  the  rule,  his
    reasoning, I find, would have made no difference to the outcome.

DECISION

 8. The determination contains no error of law which was material  and  the
    decision shall stand.


Signed:     Date 20th October 2014

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal Rimington
