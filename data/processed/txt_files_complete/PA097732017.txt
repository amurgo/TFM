                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Owusu Abebrese), sitting at Taylor House on 1  November
    2017, to  an asylum and human rights appeal by a citizen of Bangladesh,
    born 1986, who claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution there
    as a homosexual.

 2. The judge comprehensively rejected the appellant's evidence about being
    a homosexual in the first place. So far as he relied on  his  delay  in
    making a claim, he was fully entitled to do so; but that could  not  be
    the only reason, where there was any evidence  to  support  it,  as  to
    which see JT (Cameroon) [2008] EWCA Civ 878.

 3. The evidence before the judge is listed at paragraph 5 of  the  grounds
    of appeal. The judge's  reasons  for  rejecting  it  are  in  the  last
    sentence of his paragraph 20, and the last two of 22. While there would
    be nothing wrong with them as general  conclusions,  fairness  required
    that he should explain how he reached them, which he did not do.

 4. Mr Kotas accepted this unsatisfactory feature  of  the  decision  under
    appeal, which leaves us with no alternative but the following:

Appeal : decision set aside
Fresh hearing before First-tier Tribunal, not Judge Abebrese
