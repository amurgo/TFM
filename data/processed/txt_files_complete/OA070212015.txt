                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Robson made following a hearing at Bradford on 13th May 2016.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 25th January  1988.   She
    applied for settlement on the  basis  of  her  marriage  to  a  British
    citizen and was refused on the grounds that  she  could  not  meet  the
    maintenance requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  set  out  in
    Appendix FM.  The sponsor had to  show  a  gross  income  of  at  least
    �18,600 and the payslips which he had produced showed an average  gross
    income of �18,336.50.

 3. At the hearing it was acknowledged that as at the date of decision  the
    claimant could not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    However  shortly  afterwards  the  sponsor  had   been   promoted   and
    consequently could show an annual income of �19,240.

 4. The judge found that the sponsor had given credible evidence  and  that
    he had genuinely been promoted from a member of the kitchen staff to  a
    chef at the restaurant and was presently  earning  above  the  required
    threshold.

 5. In spite of finding that the claimant could not meet  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules the judge allowed the appeal and said that the
    public interest would not be breached by his doing so.

 6. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had failed to give any reasons for his decision and failed to
    consider whether the claimant and sponsor enjoyed family  life  and  if
    they did whether they could  reasonably enjoy family life elsewhere.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Astle on  31st  October  2016
    for the reasons stated in the grounds.

The Hearing

 8. Mr Diwnycz relied upon his grounds.

 9. Mr Hussain submitted that the  judge  had  implicitly  found  that  the
    couple enjoyed a family life together and that since  the  sponsor  was
    now earning above the required level as set out in  the  Rules  he  was
    entitled to allow the appeal.

10. Unfortunately this decision has to be set aside.

11. The judge erred in law in, firstly, failing to give any reasons for his
    decision, and secondly, failing to undertake  a  proper  assessment  in
    line with Razgar.

12. There is no reason to doubt the sponsor's evidence.

13.  Unfortunately,  as  at  the  date  of  application,  he  was   earning
    insufficient to meet the requirements of  the  Rules.  Accordingly  his
    appeal therefore had to be dismissed.   The  use  of  Article  8  as  a
    general dispensing power is not permitted.

14. Mr Hussain, rightly, did not even seek to  argue  that  there  was  any
    reason why  the  proper  course  in  this  case  would  not  be  a  re-
    application, which, providing  the  specified  evidence  was  produced,
    ought to succeed on the basis of the position as it now is.  It is most
    unfortunate for the sponsor that he has been put to  a  great  deal  of
    time and trouble, and no doubt  expense,  in  pursuing  an  application
    which could not have succeeded.

Decision

15. The original judge erred in law.  The decision is  set  aside.   It  is
    remade as follows. The claimant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
