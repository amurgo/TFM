Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Swain, Counsel instructed by Eagles Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Armstrong, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I do not make an anonymity direction in this matter.

 2. The appellants are citizens of India and are father and minor daughter.
    He first entered the United Kingdom as a visitor with six months' leave
    valid until March 28, 2000.  He has been an overstayer since that date.
     In March 2006 he married and he and his wife have a  daughter  who  is
    the second named appellant in this appeal.

 3. The first named appellant's wife has made a  separate  application  for
    leave to remain and this was refused by the respondent on May 25, 2016.



 4. On February 25, 2016 the appellant lodged the current  application  for
    leave to remain under the Immigration Rules on  Article  8  ECHR.   The
    respondent refused that application on May  12,  2016  and  grounds  of
    appeal were lodged by both appellants on May 25, 2016.  The matter  was
    then listed before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Grimmett on May 16,
    2017 in a decision promulgated on May 22, 2017 the joint  appeals  were
    dismissed.

 5. The appellants appealed that decision and on June 20, 2017 Judge of the
    First-tier Tribunal Baker granted permission to appeal finding  it  was
    arguable there had been no consideration of paragraph 276ADE(iv) HC 395
    or Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

 6. The respondent filed the Rule 24 response on  July  25,  2017  and  the
    matter has been listed before me.

 7. During my discussion with the parties I indicated that I believed there
    was an error in law and I then proceeded to identify the point in hand.
     In essence the Judge had considered the appeal primarily based on  the
    position of the first named appellant and  had  not  brought  into  his
    proportionality assessment the issue of paragraph 276ADE(iv) and in  an
    Article 8 assessment the Judge did not demonstrate any weight had  been
    given to Section 117B(6) of  the  2002  Act.   In  particular,  Section
    117B(6) makes it clear that this is an important factor to have  regard
    to and it is clear from the Judge's decision whilst Section 117 of  the
    2002 Act was considered it was only from the point of whether the first
    named appellant spoke English and whether he had  paid  taxes  and  was
    financially independent.  Whilst the Judge accepted  the  second  named
    appellant had established a private life he concluded  that  she  could
    return to India.  No regard was given to the fact  that  she  had  been
    here for over seven years and at the date of hearing she had been  here
    for nine years.

 8. Mr Swain acknowledged that these factors may ultimately not lead  to  a
    different outcome but his submission, which I accepted,  was  that  the
    Judge should have given those issues some weight.

 9. Mr Armstrong accepted that the Judge's decision did not  address  those
    issues and in the circumstances I found there was an error in law.

10. Both parties agreed that I should remit this matter back to the  First-
    tier Tribunal in light of Part 3 Section 7.1 to  7.3  of  the  Practice
    Statement.  I do not preserve any findings and the hearing should be  a
    full de novo hearing.




    NOTICE OF DECISION

11. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I remit the human rights  appeal
    back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.
