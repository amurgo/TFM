Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Garrod, Counsel instructed by Marsh & Partners
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals with permission against the determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, Judge Greasley, sitting at Hatton  Cross  on  10th
    July 2014 in which he dismissed her appeal against the refusal  of  the
    respondent to vary the  appellant's  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica.  She was born on  16th
    November 1991.  She arrived in the United Kingdom at or around the  age
    of 11 and has remained here since.  The basis of  her  application  was
    for discretionary leave to be granted to her in line with that  of  her
    mother, who has leave to remain until 2016.

2.   The respondent refused the appellant's application.   In  her  decision
    dated 21st June 2014 the respondent noted that although  the  appellant
    continued to reside at the same address as her mother she was  said  to
    have two jobs and an income of around �1,600 a month:

         "It has been decided therefore that you are capable  of  living  an
         independent life, and are no longer  dependent  upon  your  mother.
         Therefore, after carefully reviewing your  application  for  active
         review of discretionary  leave,  the  Secretary  of  State  is  not
         satisfied that the grounds under which you were previously  granted
         discretionary leave still persist and your application for  further
         discretionary leave is refused."

3.   The decision  continued  by  analysing  the  position  with  regard  to
    Article 8, noting amongst other things that  the  appellant  could  not
    satisfy at that stage the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

4.   There is or has been some doubt as to the policy by reference to  which
    the respondent analysed the application.  I am, however, satisfied that
    Mr Shilliday has identified the correct policy in a document handed  to
    me  this  afternoon.   As   regards   applicants   who   were   granted
    discretionary leave before 9th July 2012, which  includes  the  present
    appellant, the relevant provisions of the policy are as follows:

         ".    Decision-makers  must  consider  whether  the   circumstances
             prevailing at the time of the original grant of leave continue
             at the date of the decision.  If the circumstances remain  the
             same and the criminality thresholds do not  apply,  a  further
             period of three years' DL should normally be granted.


         .    If there have been significant changes or the applicant  fails
             to meet the criminality thresholds  ...  the  application  for
             further leave should be refused."

5.   The First-tier Judge heard oral evidence from  the  appellant  and  her
    witnesses.  It is fair to say that the judge was  troubled  by  certain
    aspects of the evidence bearing on the Article  8  issue.   So  far  as
    earnings were concerned, however, it appears that  the  judge  was  not
    persuaded that the level of the earnings was as great as that indicated
    in the respondent's decision.  I put it in that way because I  have  to
    say that the determination  is  somewhat  problematic  as  regards  the
    relevant findings.

6.   The  documentary  evidence  makes  it  abundantly  plain  that  at  the
    relevant time the applicant was working in what  can  in  no  sense  be
    described as a full-time  capacity  and  that  her  income  working  in
    connection with dental nursing was far less than that indicated by  the
    respondent.  Indeed, in fairness to the judge, he  noted  in  terms  of
    paragraph 22 that she was working  on  a  part-time  basis  and  earned
    between �500 and �600.

7.   The judge made no  clear  findings  on  the  question  of  whether  the
    respondent had correctly applied her policy.  That is  the  main  basis
    upon which permission to appeal was granted.   I  do  consider  in  the
    circumstances that that error was material.

8.   Before me, Mr Shilliday submitted  that  all  that  was  needed  was  a
    demonstration that the factual matrix  was  different  from  that  when
    leave was last granted.  In that regard he submitted that the appellant
    had become an adult and that that in itself was a change.  In  fairness
    to Mr Shilliday, it appears that that cannot be right  since  the  last
    period of leave granted to the appellant covered a period after she had
    achieved the age of 18.

9.   What therefore the judge  should  have  done  was  to  have  considered
    whether the respondent had  correctly  had  regard  to  the  evidential
    matrix in considering whether the grounds upon which the appellant  was
    previously granted discretionary leave still persisted.

10.  It is plain for the reasons I have given that the respondent fell  into
    error as regards the nature of the appellant's employment.   Whether  a
    person who has recently ceased studies and is still living at home  and
    is, albeit an adult, of young age, is working part-time or full-time is
    clearly a material issue.  The respondent has made a  mistake  in  that
    regard, as is plain from the evidence.

11.  The question for me is whether that  mistake  and  all  other  relevant
    matters combined point to a situation where the only rational  response
    that a respondent could make to the facts would be to grant  a  further
    period of discretionary leave.

12.  I am not in a position so to conclude.  I do,  however,  consider  that
    the evidence, even making allowance  for  the  degree  of  exaggeration
    regarding the absence of  ties  in  Jamaica,  strongly  points  to  the
    appellant having the basis of a very good case  for  showing  that  she
    should be granted a further period  of  discretionary  leave.   She  is
    making tentative steps towards gaining employment.  She does,  however,
    continue to reside with her mother.  There is evidence  to  the  effect
    that there is  an  emotional  bond  with  the  mother  and  with  other
    relatives.  It may be that  that  bond  is  not  sufficient  to  engage
    Article 8(1) but that is not  necessarily  the  test  for  the  present
    purposes of deciding whether to grant discretionary leave.

13.   In  short,  properly  analysed,  the  factual  position  favours   the
    appellant; although, as I say, I do not go so far as  to  find  that  a
    grant of leave is the only rational response.  What I do find, however,
    is that the judge failed to make proper findings by  reference  to  the
    correct policy.  I find that those failings were material.  I therefore
    re-make that part of his decision by allowing the  appeal  against  the
    refusal of leave to the extent that the  application  for  a  variation
    remains  outstanding  before  the   Secretary   of   State.    In   the
    circumstances I do not consider it desirable or indeed  appropriate  to
    make findings on Article 8.  That matter remains inchoate.



                               Signed                                  Date
