Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent is a citizen of  China  and  his  date  of  birth  is  4
    September 1993.  I will refer to the respondent as the appellant as  he
    was before the First-tier Tribunal.
2.   On 17 September 2013 the appellant made an application for leave  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student.  This application was refused in  a  decision
    of 1 November 2013.  The  application  was  refused  on  the  basis  of
    maintenance.
3.   The appellant appealed against the decision and his appeal was  allowed
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Callender Smith in a  determination
    that was promulgated on 2 September 2014 following a hearing at  Taylor
    House on 11 August 2014.

4.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  appeal  stating  that  "it  is
    remitted to the respondent to reconsider  the  position  and  that  the
    effect of any decision is stayed until there has been a final ruling by
    the Supreme Court in the case of Mandalia (UKSC/0279)." He  found  that
    there was a legitimate expectation created  by  the  statement  on  the
    application form that the respondent would contact  the  appellant  for
    missing documentation which did not occur.  It was  accepted  that  the
    appellant had paid his course fees and he had to establish living costs
    of ï¿½9,000.  His application was refused because he had not  provided  a
    translated bank statement and there were missing bank statements.

5.   Permission to appeal was  granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  a
    decision of 13 October 2014 by Judge Chambers.  Thus  the  matter  came
    before me.

6.   The  grounds  seeking  permission  argue  that  the  Judge  misdirected
    himself in relation to legitimate expectation and erred in  considering
    the 'evidential flexibility policy'. In my view  the  Judge  fell  into
    error. The Tribunal is bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA  Civ
    2 (not withstanding that permission was granted on 19 May 2014 and  the
    matter will be considered by the Supreme Court. The case is now  called
    Mandalia and was referred to by the Judge). It  was  not  open  to  the
    Judge to decide that the effect of  the  decision  should  be  "stayed"
    until the Supreme Court's judgement.

7.   The appellant  did  not  attend  the  hearing  before  me.   Mr  Walker
    conceded that the documentation that was provided by the  appellant  at
    the hearing established that he was in receipt of the requisite  funds.
    The  decision  maker  did  not  consider  exercising  discretion  under
    paragraph 245AA of the Rules. It  appears  to  me  that  the  appellant
    submitted a document in the wrong format and  bank  statements  from  a
    series were missing with the application.

8.   In my view the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made an  error  of  law
    in  relying  on  legitimate  expectation  and  evidential  flexibility.
    However, the error is not material because in  my  view  there  was  no
    lawful decision because the  Secretary  of  State  has  not  considered
    exercising  discretion  in  accordance  with  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

9.      The decision to allow the appeal is maintained (on the basis  of  my
    decision not that of the FtT).
