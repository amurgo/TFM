For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Philippines  born  on  23rd  February
    1979.  The Appellant's immigration history is  that  on  21st  February
    2000 she applied for a six month  visit  visa.   That  application  was
    replaced by one for indefinite leave to remain on 9th October 2000  and
    that was refused.  On 24th December  2004  she  applied  for  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules and that again was refused but not until  18th
    July 2007.  On 18th July 2007 she was served with a IS151A notice.   On
    13th July 2013 application was made on her behalf for a residence  card
    as a confirmation of a right to reside in the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    spouse of a Polish national Mr Lukasz Piotrowski.   It  is  clear  from
    that immigration history that the Appellant's immigration  history  can
    at best be described as poor and that she has on many occasions been an
    overstayer.  On 24th November 2013 the  Appellant  was  served  with  a
    Notice of Refusal letter.  It was noted therein that in support of  the
    Appellant's application the Appellant had provided wage slips  for  the
    weeks 27th June 2013 and 11th July 2013 from  RET  Engineering  Limited
    and Lloyds TSB statements to cover the period 10th January 2013 to  9th
    July 2013.  It was further  noted  that  in  order  to  qualify  for  a
    residence card the Appellant had to  provide  evidence  to  demonstrate
    that her EEA Sponsor was exercising treaty rights through employment or
    self-employment.  The Appellant claimed her EEA  national  Sponsor  was
    employed with RET Engineering Limited and that whilst wage  slips  from
    27th June 2013 and 11th July 2013 from RET Engineering  Limited  showed
    cheque payments of �347.82 and �358.33 the bank statements did not show
    corresponding entries to match the amount of the wage  slips.   Without
    any further evidence the Secretary of State was therefore not satisfied
    that  the  Appellant's  EEA  national  is  presently  employed  by  RET
    Engineering  Limited  as  claimed  hence  the  refusal  to  issue   the
    confirmation sought was made with reference to Regulation 6(b)  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Mrs RJNB Morris sitting at Richmond on  22nd  July  2014.
    In a determination promulgated  on  4th  August  2014  the  Appellant's
    appeal was dismissed under the Immigration Rules and under the EEA 2006
    Regulations.

 3. On 8th August 2014 Grounds of Appeal were lodged to the Upper Tribunal.
     That application for permission was  refused  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Lever on 21st August 2014.  That application was renewed when the
    extended grounds were submitted on 5th September 2014.  On 14th October
    2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun granted permission  to  appeal.   Judge
    Eshun  considered  that  it  was  arguable  that  the  judge  erred  in
    concluding that it had not been shown that the Sponsor was a "qualified
    person" for the requisite continuous five  year  period.   Judge  Eshun
    noted that the grounds made it clear that the applicant was  seeking  a
    residence card as the wife of the  Sponsor,  an  EEA  Polish  national.
    That application was refused under Regulation 6 because the  Respondent
    was not satisfied that the  Sponsor  is  presently  employed  with  RET
    Engineering Limited as claimed and that in such  circumstances  it  was
    arguable that the judge erred in considering the issue in  terms  of  a
    "continuous five year period."

 4. It is on that basis that the appeal comes before me.  The Appellant  is
    represented by his instructed Counsel Mr Richardson.  The Secretary  of
    State appears by her Home Office Presenting Officer Mr Kandola.

Submissions

 5. Mr Richardson contends that the judge has been pre-occupied in  showing
    that the Sponsor has worked for five years continuously  as  a  worker.
    He contends that it  was  only  necessary  for  the  Sponsor  to  be  a
    qualified person at the date of hearing and the judge should  not  have
    been concerned with  the  Sponsor's  history  but  concerned  with  his
    employment at the date of the hearing.  Mr  Kandola  acknowledges  this
    position and indicates he accepts that there is a material error of law
    in the approach adopted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   Whilst
    noting that the P60 provided in the Appellant's bundle corroborates  to
    a degree the employment history of the Sponsor by  checking  with  HMRC
    with regard to the Sponsor's employment that will be determinative.  He
    asked me to find that there is an error of law but not  to  prepare  my
    determination  until  such  time  as  he  has  obtained  the   relevant
    information.  Mr Richardson is agreeable with this approach.

Findings

 6. In such circumstances I  agree  and  concede  that  there  has  been  a
    material error of law in the determination of the  Tribunal  Judge.   I
    also acknowledge the position as to what will be determinative  of  the
    outcome of this appeal which is agreed to by both the representative of
    the Appellant and the Secretary of State.  I am now  provided  with  an
    email from the Secretary of State dated 6th January 2015.   That  email
    reads as follows

         "I have just received information from HMRC which confirms that the
         Appellant's husband Lukasz Piotrowski (the EEA  Sponsor)  has  been
         employed since 2009 with RET Engineering Limited and  is  presently
         employed there and that the details of his last P60 are accurate.

         As the only outstanding issue was whether the EEA spouse is working
         and  thereby  exercising  treaty   rights   this   information   is
         determinative of the matter.  Accordingly the SSHD is  content  for
         the appeal to be allowed."

 7. In such circumstances the Appellant's appeal is allowed under  the  EEA
    Regulations.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of  law
and is set aside.  The decision is re-made allowing the  Appellant's  appeal
under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to  Rule  13  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)
Rules 2014.  No application is made to vary that order and none is made.
