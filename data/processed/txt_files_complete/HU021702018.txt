For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Uganda who  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the respondent dated  15  December  2017
    (following the appellant's application of  9  August  2017)  to  refuse
    indefinite leave to remain.  The appellant  appealed  on  human  rights
    grounds.  In a decision, promulgated on 30 October 2018, Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Abebrese dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  all
    grounds.

 2. The appellant appeals with permission from the Upper Tribunal,  on  the
    grounds that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  dismissing
    the appellant's appeal in effect because the appellant had not produced
    a decision of Immigration Judge Maxwell (promulgated on 17  May  2011).
    It was  contended  that  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Abebrese
    unreasonably dismissed the evidence from the appellant  including  that
    Immigration Judge Maxwell had proceeded on the basis  that  the  appeal
    was made in time and therefore  it  was  unreasonable  for  Immigration
    Judge Abebrese to have proceeded on the basis that only the  production
    of the determination would have satisfied him that it  was  treated  as
    made in time.  It was also submitted that it was for the Upper Tribunal
    to determine whether Section 3C leave applies  in  circumstances  where
    the First-tier Tribunal treats an appeal as one made in time regardless
    of the expiry of the fourteen day time limit.  The grounds went  on  to
    argue that Judge Abebrese failed to correctly apply the  provisions  of
    paragraph 276B (such was not pursued by Mr Chohan) and that  the  judge
    erred in his consideration of paragraph 276ADE and/or consideration  of
    Article 8 and GEN. 3.1 and 3.2 of the Immigration Rules.

 3. I had before me what Judge Abebrese had not, a copy of Judge  Maxwell's
    decision promulgated on 17 May 2011 dismissing  the  appellant's  case.
    Judge Maxwell in a brief decision noted that  the  appellant  had  been
    refused entry by the respondent on  10  January  2011.   There  was  no
    discussion of whether or not the appeal was in time or  otherwise.   Ms
    Isherwood submitted,  with  consent,  the  cover  page  of  the  bundle
    produced to Judge Maxwell considered on 16 May 2011.   That  bundle  is
    dated 21 April 2011 and indicates that the respondent's  decision,  the
    subject of the appellant's appeal was on 11 January 2011, (rather  than
    10 January as noted by Judge Maxwell, although nothing turns  on  that)
    and that the appeal was lodged on 28 March 2011 with the hearing on  16
    May 2011.

 4. The appellant contends that she made an application for leave to remain
    outside of the Rules on 19 January 2011.  The respondent notes, in  the
    consideration of the timeline of the appellant's case in  the  decision
    dated 15 December 2017, that the appellant did make an  application  on
    19 January 2011 for leave on compassionate  rules  but  that  this  was
    rejected on 13 March 2011 for non-payment and that therefore  this  was
    considered invalid and did not invoke leave under  Section  3C  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971.  Therefore it  was  the  respondent's  case  that
    lawful leave was not extended beyond the previous grant  of  leave,  in
    this case, 24 January 2011, it not being disputed  that  the  appellant
    arrived on 6 September 2007 and had continuous lawful  leave  until  24
    January 2011 having made an in-time application  on  24  October  2010,
    which was refused with a right of  appeal  on  10  January  2011.   The
    appellant's previous leave, as a student,  was  due  to  expire  on  31
    October 2010 but was extended, under section 3C, until 24 January 2011.

 5. Although Mr Chohan sought valiantly to  persuade  me  otherwise,  I  am
    satisfied that the application  of  statute  is  clear  in  this  case.
    Section 3C of the 1971 Act at the relevant time provided as follows:-

         "(1) This section applies if -

             (a)  a person who has limited leave to enter or remain in  the
                  United Kingdom applies  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for
                  variation of the leave,

             (b)  the application for variation is made  before  the  leave
                  expires, and

             (c)  the leave expires without the application  for  variation
                  having been decided.

         (2)  The leave is extended by virtue of  this  section  during  any
             period when -

             (a)  the application for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
                  withdrawn,

             (b)   an  appeal  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
                  Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 could be brought, while an
                  appellant is in the United Kingdom against the decision on
                  the application for variation (ignoring any possibility of
                  an appeal out of time with permission),

             (c)  an  appeal  under  that  section  against  that  decision
                  brought while the appellant is in the  United  Kingdom  is
                  pending (within the meaning of section 104 of that Act).

         (3)  Leave extended by virtue of this section shall  lapse  if  the
             applicant leaves the United Kingdom.

         (4)  A person may not make an  application  for  variation  of  his
             leave to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  where  that
             leave is extended by virtue of this section.

         (5)  But subsection (4) does  not  prevent  the  variation  of  the
             application mentioned in subsection 1(a)."

 6. The respondent confirms that the appellant had leave until  24  January
    2011.  The respondent submitted that  the  appellant  only  had  lawful
    leave until 24 January 2011. As  highlighted  in  the  respondent's  15
    January 2019 'Leave  extended  by  section  3C(and  leave  extended  by
    section 3D in transitional cases)' guidance, section 3C leave ends when
    the person does not appeal or seek  permission  to  appeal  within  the
    relevant time limit even if the relevant Tribunal accepts the appeal or
    the application for permission to appeal out of time.  Once section  3C
    leave has come to an end, it cannot be resurrected.  Section  3C  leave
    exists only where it is a seamless continuation of leave, either extant
    leave or section 3C leave

 7. Although a further application was made by the appellant on 19  January
    2011 that application was not valid.  The appellant submitted an out of
    time appeal on 28 March 2011, against the  decision  dated  10  January
    2011 (contrary to the timeline in the grounds for permission to  appeal
    there was no consideration  of  the  invalid  application  made  on  19
    January) which was subsequently considered by Judge Maxwell.   Although
    an application can be made to vary an outstanding application  to  vary
    leave (which results in the extension of leave by operation of  section
    3C) that is not what happened in the appellant's case.

 8. In the appellant's case the respondent had refused her  application  on
    10  January  2011  and  the  appellant  made  a   subsequent,   invalid
    application, on 19 January 2011.  Where an application is made in  time
    but for some reason is procedurally defective section 3C leave does not
    extend to an application which is not validly made in  accordance  with
    the Immigration Rules.  In addition,  section  3C(4)  provides  that  a
    person may not make an application for variation of his leave to  enter
    or remain while that leave is extended by virtue of this  section  (see
    including R (Iqbal, Mirza and Another) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2017] 1 WLR 85  and Ali Bashir [2018] EWCA Civ  2612).
     Although section 3C(4) does not operate as a  'bar  to  justice'  such
    that, for example, the First-tier Tribunal could not consider an appeal
    (see including Anwar & another  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2010] EWCA Civ 1275)  that is distinct from  the  issue  in
    this case.  Statutory jurisdiction cannot be  conferred  by  waiver  or
    agreement (Virk & others v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWCA Civ 652).

 9. Although Mr Chohan submitted that Judge Maxwell must have extended time
    to appeal, that is a different question and the issue is not whether or
    not a Tribunal has jurisdiction but whether the statutory extension  of
    leave applies.   In  this  case  it  cannot,  because  the  appellant's
    (section 3C) leave expired on 24 January and the attempt to  submit  an
    application prior to that leave expiring was not  a  valid  application
    and therefore leave was  not  extended.   The  respondent  was  correct
    therefore in the conclusion that the appellant had no leave between  24
    January 2011 and 5 July 2011 when her  post-study  migrant  application
    was granted.

10. Although therefore Judge Abebrese may have erred in placing  weight  on
    the absence of Immigration Judge Maxwell's decision, any such error  is
    not material as  ultimately  Judge  Abebrese  was  satisfied  that  the
    respondent was correct in the conclusion that there was a  gap  in  the
    appellant's continuous leave, for the purposes of consideration of  her
    application under the  ten  year  residence  provisions.   Equally  the
    reference in the grounds for permission to  appeal  other  sections  of
    paragraph 276B was misplaced and Mr Chohan rightly did not pursue those
    grounds.

11. In the circumstances there was also no material error  in  the  judge's
    consideration and dismissal of the appellant's Article 8 claim for  the
    reasons he gave including that very little weight was attached  to  the
    appellant's private life (see paragraphs [27] through to [30]).

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law and shall stand.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
