Notaries

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. Permission to appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      promulgated on 9th May 2014 was granted on the  grounds  that  it  was
      arguable that the claimant did not provide the required documents with
      her application to vary her leave to remain as a Tier  4  student  and
      was thus unable to satisfy the relevant rule applicable to her at  the
      time. Further permission to appeal was granted on the grounds that  it
      was arguable that although the First-tier Tribunal judge had  referred
      to the "evidential flexibility policy" he had failed to identify which
      relevant provision applied.


        Background

   2. The claimant sought to vary her leave to remain as a Tier  4  student.
      The application was refused on 22nd January 2014 and  a  decision  was
      also made to remove her from the UK in accordance with s47 Immigration
      Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


   3. The application was rejected on the basis that  because  her  previous
      leave to remain was as a Tier 1 Post Study Migrant and not as a Tier 4
      migrant student she could not claim to have  an  established  presence
      and thus she was required to show funds to  cover  the  fees  for  the
      first academic year and ï¿½800 per month for 9 months  for  herself.  On
      the basis of documentation produced  with  her  application  the  SSHD
      found that the claimant was unable to show that she held the  required
      funds.


   4. In her grounds  of  appeal  the  claimant  asserted  that  there  were
      sufficient funds as evidenced by a letter from Future  View  Financial
      Services Ltd dated 18/12/2013 and that  a  further  letter  from  this
      organisation dated 30th January 2014 clarified that the funds had been
      in  the  account  since  2009.  She  submitted  that   the   financial
      information  forwarded  to  the  Secretary  of  State  clearly  showed
      sufficient funds. She further  asserted  that  the  SSHD  should  have
      applied paragraph 245AA and requested the letter said to  be  attached
      to the letter dated 18th December 2013,  which  had  been  omitted  in
      error from her application.


        Error of law

   5. The judge correctly identified that the appeal turned  on  the  narrow
      issue of whether  the  claimant  had  sufficient  funds  to  meet  the
      maintenance requirements. In [11] and [12] the judge states that


        "It is clear that at the time  of  the  application  the  Appellant
        could not meet the requirements. The funds in the account for First
        Bank operated  by  the  Appellant's  father  did  not  satisfy  the
        requirements over the requisite period and there  appears  to  have
        been a document missing in relation to the accounts held by  Future
        View......In this particular case it is clear from the letter  from
        Future View dated 18th December 2013 that the funds in Future  View
        are held on a long term basis. That letter refers  to  an  attached
        document. The attached document was not submitted. It was  open  to
        the Home Office in the circumstances,  and  given  that  the  funds
        would have been sufficient, to call for the attached document,  the
        Home Office did not do so and accordingly and in view of  the  fact
        that there is no doubt that the requisite funds have been held  for
        the requisite period I am allowing the appeal."


   6. The letter from Future View dated 18th December does  not  state  that
      the funds are held on a long term basis but rather states


        "This is to confirm that the above named client  operates  a  Fixed
        Income (Money Market Indexed Portfolio) account with us which as at
        the date of this letter is valued at N4,212,763.26k...."
        The judge therefore erred in law as to his interpretation  of  that
        letter.


   7. The "missing document" was a letter purportedly attached to the letter
      dated 18th December 2013 from Future View Financial Services Ltd.  The
      letter dated 18th December 2013 goes on to state


        "......We hereby confirm that the attached  document  is  authentic
        and the information contained therein accurate."


        The letter attached which  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  states
        should have been sought, in accordance with the flexibility policy,
        is  dated  December  19  2013   and   provides   information   that
        N4,212,763.26 was held on a valued date of 22  November  2013  with
        maturity on 20 December 2013 at an interest rate of 12% per  annum.
        That letter did not exist on 18th December 2013. There is no letter
        or document dated 18th December other than the letter referring  to
        an attached document.


   8. Mr Hussein submitted that it was clear from a  handwritten  note  that
      the letter of 18th December had been collected on  19th  December  and
      that the explanation for the different dates was a banking  error.  He
      could not explain why the appellant had not sent that letter  in  with
      her application given that her evidence was that both  the  letter  of
      18th December and 19th December had been collected at the same time.


   9. Ms Saddiq submitted that the letter of 19th December did not exist  on
      18th December and thus could not be authenticated; that there  was  no
      obligation on the part of the Secretary of State under paragraph 245AA
      to request the attachment because there was nothing in the  letter  of
      18th December which indicated that it would assist the  appellant  and
      in any event the letter of 19th December did not  show  the  requisite
      funds because it was referring to funds held for a period prior to the
      date  of  application.  She  further  submitted  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal judge had erred in law in failing to identify  which  section
      of paragraph  245AA  she  was  referring  to  when  finding  that  the
      Secretary of State should have sought the attachment.

  10. The two questions that need to be asked are should  the  Secretary  of
      State have sought the missing attachment and if so can the  letter  of
      19th December be that missing  document.  Although  the  Secretary  of
      State submits that the judge erred in law in failing to  identify  the
      relevant section of paragraph 245AA in her determination  if  it  were
      apparent that the document should and could  have  been  requested  in
      accordance with the rules then a failure to specify the section  would
      not be fatal. But in this case this appellant had submitted a document
      that set out that her father held the requisite funds for her  support
      on that date. It is not however apparent that  the  document  that  is
      referred to as being authenticated has anything to do with the  funds.
      It is not apparent that the missing documents could  provide  evidence
      of funds or that it may include evidence that the funds had been  held
      for the requisite period. Thus the failure of the Secretary  of  State
      to request the document was not contrary to paragraph  245AA  and  the
      judge erred in law in so finding.

  11. Even if that is incorrect and  the  Secretary  of  State  should  have
      requested the missing document, the letter dated 19th  December  could
      not have been that document. It is not possible  for  a  letter  dated
      18th December 2013 to authenticate a document dated a day later.  Even
      though the letter of  18th  December  was  not  collected  until  19th
      December, it had been prepared on 18th December and in the absence  of
      any explanation from Future View how it could authenticate a  document
      that had not been prepared there was inadequate  evidence  before  the
      SSHD that the appellant had the requisite funds.

  12. I am therefore satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal judge  erred  in
      law in finding firstly that the SSHD should have requested  a  missing
      document that, on the face of documents already before her, would  not
      have assisted her in assessing the availability of funds, and secondly
      that even if that missing document had been requested no such document
      has been produced that shows  that  the  claimant  had  the  requisite
      funds.

  13. I set aside the decision to be remade.

        Remaking of the decision.

  14. The appellant failed to produce evidence that she had  adequate  funds
      for the requisite period of time. The letter dated 19th December 2013,
      although showing  that  the  appellant  had  adequate  funds  was  not
      produced with her application. It was not a document that was attached
      to the letter of 18th December 2013.


  15. The Secretary of State was under  no  obligation  in  accordance  with
      paragraph 245AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules  to  request  a  document
      referred to in the letter of 18th December, which did not, on its face
      have any bearing on the period of time her father had held the funds.

  16. Letters produced subsequent to the decision for the  purposes  of  the
      appeal appear to indicate that the appellant did have  access  to  the
      required funds, as does the letter of 19th December but none of  these
      letters was produced with her application. That evidence does not meet
      the requirements of the Rules and is thus not relevant in this appeal.

  17. I find that the appellant has not discharged the burden of proof  that
      she meets the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.  I  dismiss  her
      appeal against the decision of the respondent dated 22nd January 2014.

  18. In so far as the decision to remove her pursuant to s47  is  concerned
      the appellant did not seek to appeal that decision in her  grounds  of
      appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. It does not appear that she  sought
      to amend her grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and has  not
      sought to do so before me. The  decision  to  remove  her  dated  22nd
      January 2014 therefore stands.



          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it
