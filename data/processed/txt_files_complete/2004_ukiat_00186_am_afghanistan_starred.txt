                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


  1. The Appellant, a citizen of  Afghanistan,  appeals,  with  permission,
     against the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr L D Sacks,  dismissing
     his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State on 1st March
     2001 refusing him asylum, on the ground that  he  had  abandoned  that
     appeal.

The facts

  2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom clandestinely by lorry  on
     22nd January 2000.  On 25th January, he claimed asylum.  The  decision
     of the Secretary of State was, as we have indicated, made on 1st March
     2001.  He refused asylum, but also told the Appellant that:

           "It has been decided, however, that because  of  the  particular
           circumstances of your case, you should  be  granted  exceptional
           leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The Secretary  of  State
           therefore grants you leave to remain until 27/02/2005."
  3. The Notice of Decision set out the Appellant's right to  appeal  under
     section 69(3) of the 1999 Act.  That subsection is  in  the  following
     terms:

           "A person who-
              (a)      has been refused leave to enter  or  remain  in  the
                 United Kingdom on the basis of a claim for asylum  made  by
                 him, but
              b) has been granted (whether before or after the decision  to
                 refuse leave) limited leave to enter or remain,
           may, if that limited leave will not expire within 28 days of his
           being notified of the decision, appeal to an adjudicator against
           the refusal on the ground that requiring him to leave the United
           Kingdom after the time limited by that leave would  be  contrary
           to the Convention."

  4. The Appellant exercised his right of appeal by notice dated 13th March
     2001.  In August 2002, the Appellant left the United Kingdom and  went
     to Iran, to see members of his close family who are said to be  living
     there illegally.  The Adjudicator appears to have been  told  that  he
     remained in Iran for four weeks.

  5. Section 58(8) of the 1999 Act is in the following terms:

           "A pending appeal under this Part is to be treated as  abandoned
           if the Appellant leaves the United Kingdom."

  6. It was in reliance upon that provision that the Adjudicator  dismissed
     the appeal as abandoned.

The proceedings before the Tribunal

  7. Mr Henderson submitted to us that Article 6 of the European Convention
     on Human Rights applies to "upgrade" appeals of this  sort.   In  that
     context, he submitted that s 58(8)  of  the  1999  Act  infringed  the
     Appellant's right of access to a court, and that it  should  therefore
     be "read down" by the insertion of words disapplying it  from  appeals
     under s 69(3).  He accordingly  submitted  that  the  Adjudicator  was
     wrong to treat the Appellant's  appeal  as  abandoned  merely  by  his
     having left the United Kingdom whilst it had been pending.

  8. Having heard Mr Henderson say everything that could be said in support
     of those submissions, we found we did not need to call upon Mr Buckley
     to reply.

The legal background

(i)   "Upgrade" appeals

  9. The Appellant's experience in being refused asylum but granted limited
     leave to remain is by no means unique.  Section 8(2) of the Asylum and
     Immigration Appeals Act 1993 provides as follows:

           "A person who has limited leave under the 1971 Act to  enter  or
           remain in the United Kingdom may appeal to a special adjudicator
           against any variation of, or refusal to vary, the leave  on  the
           ground that  it  would  be  contrary  to  the  United  Kingdom's
           obligations under the Convention for him to be required to leave
           the United Kingdom after the time limited by the leave."


 10. Before the decision of the Court of Appeal in Saad, Diriye and  Osorio
     v SSHD [2001] EWCA Civ 2008, [2002] INLR 34, it had been thought  that
     in order to succeed in an appeal under that section, a claimant  would
     need to demonstrate that it would be contrary to the United  Kingdom's
     obligations under the Convention for him to be required to  leave  the
     United Kingdom after the time limited by  his  leave.   The  Court  of
     Appeal held, however, that, on its true construction, s  8(2)  of  the
     1993 Act enabled a claimant to pursue an appeal on the ground that, at
     the time of the appeal, he was entitled to the  status  of  a  refugee
     under the Refugee Convention.  Thus s 8(2) gave him the opportunity to
     "upgrade" his status from that of a person granted exception leave  to
     remain to that of a refugee.  The  jurisdiction  was  preserved  by  s
     69(3) of the 1999 Act, under which this appeal  is  brought,  and  now
     appears, in  substance,  as  s  83  of  the  2002  Act.   As  will  be
     appreciated, the claimant in an "upgrade" appeal is not  at  immediate
     risk of removal from the United Kingdom whether he wins his appeal  or
     not.  His appeal is concerned not with his  irremovability,  but  with
     the reasons for his irremovability.

(ii)  Article 6 of the ECHR

 11. Article 6 is scheduled to the Human Rights Act  1998  and  is  thus  a
     "Convention right" for the purposes of that Act.  It is headed  "Right
     to a fair trial", and we need set out only the first sentence  of  the
     first paragraph:

           "1.   In the determination of his civil rights  and  obligations
                 or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled
                 to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an
                 independent and impartial Tribunal established by law."

 12. The "right of access to a court"  in  human  rights  jurisprudence  is
     founded upon that provision.

Article 6 and "upgrade" asylum appeals

 13. In his efforts to demonstrate to us that Article 6 applies to  upgrade
     appeals, Mr Henderson took us through some recent decisions, including
     MNM v SSHD [2000] INLR 576, Maaouia v France (ECtHR App  No  39652/98)
     and Adams and Benn  v  UK,  EComHR  App  Nos  28979/95  and  30343/96.
     Accepting of course that each of those decisions relates to matters of
     immigration and excludes Articles 6, he submitted that  none  of  them
     was sufficient to show that Article 6 does not apply to a case such as
     the present where no exclusion is in prospect.

 14. In our view, these submissions are  misconceived.   The  judgments  to
     which Mr Henderson referred are not the only bases upon which it could
     be said that Article 6 does not apply to a case such as  the  present.
     They are exemplifications of the general rule that Article 6  applies,
     in non-criminal causes, to matters  of  private  law  rather  than  of
     public law.  So much is clear from the Commission's opinion  in  Adams
     and Benn v UK,  where  the  Commission  considers  whether  Article  6
     applies to the Claimants' argument that they  were  entitled  to  free
     movement rights under the treaties constituting the European Union:

           "The Commission in any event is of the opinion  that  any  right
           involved is of a public law nature, having regard to the  origin
           and general nature of the provision, which lacks  the  personal,
           economic or individual aspects which are characteristic  to  the
           private law sphere ... .  Consequently, the matter falls outside
           the scope of the concept of 'civil rights and obligations'."

 15. It is right to say that, in a number of instances, the Court has  held
     that Article 6 applies to some areas of law which would be regarded as
     public, rather than private law:  for example social security payments
     (Feldbrugge v Netherlands  (1991)  13  EHRR  571),  judicial  pensions
     (Lombardo v Italy (1996) 21 EHRR 188),  and,  within  a  very  limited
     sphere, some matters relating to  tax  (Editions  Pï¿½riscope  v  France
     (1992) 14 EHRR 597).  The inroads into the principle  that  Article  6
     does not apply to public law rights,  however,  have  been  made  only
     where it has been demonstrated that at the heart of  the  claim  is  a
     right to property or some allied matter, sounding typically in private
     law and rendered a  matter  of  public  law  only  by  the  particular
     circumstances of the individual case.

 16. We appreciate that, for the Appellant, the  advantage  of  an  upgrade
     appeal may be an increased entitlement to social security benefits and
     other rights within  the  United  Kingdom.   These  may  be  important
     matters for the Appellant, but they are not what  is  seen  to  be  at
     issue in an "upgrade"  appeal.   The  nature  of  such  an  appeal  is
     authoritatively set out in the decision of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
     Saad, Diriye and Osorio v SSHD.  At paragraph 16,  Lord  Phillips  MR,
     giving the judgment of the Court, indicated  that  the  background  to
     such an appeal is the following:

           "... absent a clear parliamentary intention to the contrary,  we
           would expect our primary and delegated legislation to provide  a
           system whereby claimants may have it determined whether they are
           refugees.  It is only that determination which gives them access
           to  Convention  rights.   We  therefore  approach  questions  of
           construction on that basis."


      Later in the judgment, at paragraph [37], section 8 of the 1993 Act is
      analysed as giving "a right of appeal on grounds that  directly  raise
      the issue of the refugee status of the appellant".  At paragraph [68],
      the decision of the Court is that "an appeal under section 8(2)  will,
      just as in the case of appeals  under  the  other  three  subsections,
      raise as the crucial issue  the  question  of  whether  the  appellant
      enjoys refugee status at the time of the hearing of the appeal".


 17. Nothing could be clearer.  The issue in an upgrade appeal  is  whether
     the claimant is entitled to the status  of  refugee,  a  status  which
     exists only in international and public law and is  not  a  matter  of
     private law.  There is no basis for supposing that Article  6  of  the
     European Convention on Human Rights applies to  the  determination  of
     such a question.

 18. That is sufficient to dispose of this appeal, but in deference to  the
     complex arguments put by Mr Henderson we will indicate what  our  view
     would have been if we had been with him on the principal issue.

"Access to a court"

 19. Mr Henderson submitted that the effect of s 58(8) was to  deprive  the
     Appellant of access to a court in a manner which was disproportionate.
      We do not accept that submission.  In the  first  place,  it  is  not
     suggested that the Appellant had any pressing need to leave the United
     Kingdom at the moment when he did, when his appeal  was  pending.   To
     accede to the submission on the limited facts on  which  it  is  based
     would be accept that a claimant is  entitled  to  access  to  a  court
     whatever he may do to reduce the possibility  of  access  by  his  own
     acts.

 20. Secondly, and again on the limited facts of which we  have  been  made
     aware, we do not accept that, in the Appellant's case, the restriction
     of  access  to  a  court  would  have  been   properly   regarded   as
     disproportionate.  The essence of the Refugee Convention  is  that  it
     protects a claimant by his presence in a "safe" country.  It does  not
     of itself entitle the claimant to reside in  any  particular  country.
     Further, there  is  nothing  in  the  Refugee  Convention  or  in  any
     associated jurisprudence which requires a country which  the  claimant
     has left to continue the determination of his claim, save where such a
     requirement is imposed on a country  of  first  entry  by  some  other
     independent  agreement  such  as  the  Dublin  Convention.   In  these
     circumstances, it appears to us entirely proper for the United Kingdom
     to provide by statute that a person's claim to be a refugee finding  a
     safe haven in the United Kingdom effectively ceases,  if  not  finally
     determined, before he leaves the United Kingdom.   If  at  some  later
     stage, he wishes to re-assert a claim to refugee status here,  he  can
     no doubt do so.

"Reading Down" Section 58(8)

 21. Mr Henderson submitted that, if Article 6 applied to upgrade  appeals,
     s 58(8) of the 1999  Act  should  be  "read  down",  as  a  matter  of
     interpretation in accordance with the Human Rights Act  1998,  by  the
     insertion of words, so that it reads as follows:

           "A pending appeal under this Part other than section 69(3) is to
           be treated as abandoned  if  the  appellant  leaves  the  United
           Kingdom."


      We have some difficulty in accepting the general proposition  that  we
      would have power to insert those words and so change  the  meaning  of
      the statute.  There does not appear to us to be any reason to  do  so,
      other than possibly  recognising  in  an  appropriate  case  that  the
      statute was not entirely in conformity with the  requirements  of  the
      1998 Act.  Even if we were persuaded otherwise, however, we should not
      accept that the statute should be read down in the sense suggested  by
      Mr Henderson, which would disapply s 58(8) from all "upgrade"  appeals
      but from no other appeals.


 22. For the reasons we have given in the last section of this judgment, we
     would not accept the proposition that the impact  of  s  58(8)  is  to
     deprive every upgrade claimant from access to a court in circumstances
     which would be disproportionate.  In our view,  the  justification  of
     that result would vary from case to case and it would therefore not be
     right to suggest that leaving the United Kingdom ought never to  cause
     automatic abandonment of the appeal.

 23. Secondly, it is difficult to see why, if Mr Henderson's argument  were
     to be accepted, it should not equally apply  to  non-asylum  claimants
     who have an in-country right of appeal:  for example, a  student  who,
     whilst appealing against the refusal of an extension  of  his  student
     visa, goes, as part of his course, on a day trip to Paris.   Thus  the
     reading suggested by Mr Henderson goes too far in the case of  upgrade
     appeals and not far enough in the case of other appeals.

 24. For the reasons given earlier in this judgment, we find that there  is
     no principle requiring s 58(8)  to  be  interpreted  in  this  way  or
     altered on the basis of Article 6, for Article 6  does  not  apply  to
     this appeal.  For the reasons we have indicated,  however,  we  should
     have rejected Mr Henderson's other arguments as well.

 25. It is acknowledged that in the absence of success on these  arguments,
     the Appellant's appeal stands as abandoned.  We confirm that  that  is
     indeed the case and dismiss his appeal to the Tribunal.
