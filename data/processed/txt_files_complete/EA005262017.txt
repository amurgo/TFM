Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Holt, Counsel instructed by Law Lane Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, a citizen of Malaysia (born  [  ]  1972),  appeals  with
    permission against the decision of a First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Myers)
    dismissing his appeal against the Respondent's decision of 1st  January
    2017 revoking his residence card as a family member of an EEA  national
    and refusing him entry to the UK.

 2. The relevant facts of this matter are well-known to  both  parties  and
    for the purposes of this decision the following summary  will  suffice.
    The Appellant entered the UK on 13th June  2003  with  leave  valid  to
    October 2006.  In 2005 he met [MH] "the Sponsor", a Czech national born
    [ ] 1975.  She was exercising treaty rights in the UK.

 3. The Appellant and Sponsor married on 22nd December  2007  and  on  29th
    September 2008 he was issued with a residence  card  valid  until  29th
    September 2013.  On [ ] 2008 the Sponsor gave  birth  to  the  couple's
    twin children.

 4. On 14th April 2014 the Appellant was issued with  a  further  residence
    card, valid until 14th  April  2018.   In  October  2015  however,  the
    Sponsor and the children left the UK and travelled.   The  Sponsor  was
    required to look after her parents both of whom  had  fallen  ill.  The
    Appellant remained in the UK.  His wife returned to the UK on  occasion
    with the children in order to see him,  albeit  briefly,  and  he  also
    undertook visits to his wife and children in the Czech Republic.

 5. On his return from such a visit to the Czech  Republic,  the  Appellant
    was detained at  Manchester  Airport  when  seeking  re-entry  on  31st
    December 2016, following which his residence card was  revoked  on  1st
    January 2017.

 6. The  Respondent  set  out  one  ground  for  revoking  the  Appellant's
    residence card; she was not satisfied that the  Appellant  was  seeking
    entry as the family member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights.
     The Appellant's wife had returned to the Czech Republic  in  2015,  to
    look after her parents and had no plans at that point to return to  the
    UK.  The Respondent therefore decided to  revoke  the  Appellant's  EEA
    family permit although he was granted temporary admission.



First-tier Tribunal Hearing

 7. The Appellant appealed against the revocation decision  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  There were two main challenges raised before  the  FtT.
    Additionally an Article 8  challenge  was  raised  but  that  does  not
    feature in the present proceedings.

 8. It was  said  before  the  FtT,  that  the  Respondent's  decision  was
    incorrect because:

          i.      the Sponsor could be said to still be  exercising  treaty
             rights, with reference to Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38/EC

         ii.      following on from that, although  it  was  accepted  that
             there was a gap in the documentary evidence provided  for  the
             period  July  2009  -  2012,  nevertheless  the  Sponsor   had
             exercised treaty rights from 2005.  Therefore, the Sponsor had
             acquired a right to permanent residence  on  account  of  five
             years lawful residence.  Thus the Appellant, as her  dependent
             spouse, had acquired the same right.  The Appellant's case was
             set out in his witness statement.

 9. The FtTJ under a heading "Findings and Reasons" set out  at  [10],  the
    EEA Regulations in relation to Article 7(3)  of  Directive  2004/38/EC.
    She then said the following at [11]:

         "I accept the submission made on behalf of the Appellant  that  the
         illness referred to in 7 (a) [of the above directive] does not have
         to be illness of the Sponsor, because there could be  circumstances
         where a Sponsor is unable to work because it is necessary  to  look
         after a sick child or other relative.  The difficulty though that I
         have with the application of 7 (3) in the Appellant's situation  is
         in finding that the Sponsor is temporarily unable to work.  .......
         I cannot find that his wife has only temporarily ceased work in the
         UK, and therefore I find that she is no  longer  exercising  Treaty
         Rights."

    She followed this by saying at [12]:

         "It was further submitted that although the Appellant accepts  that
         there is a gap in the documentation  between  July  2009  and  2012
         showing his wife's exercise of Treaty Rights in the UK, she had  in
         fact done so from 2005, as set out in paragraph 19 of  his  witness
         statement.  It was therefore the case that  they  could  both  have
         made an application for permanent residence, but he had  failed  to
         do so because of poor legal advice.  It is  possible  that  had  he
         applied, he would have been  granted  permanent  residence,  but  I
         cannot comment on that; and the fact remains that he did not do  so
         [my italics].  In my judgment this is not something  which  can  be
         granted retrospectively after his wife has returned  to  the  Czech
         Republic."

10. Thereafter she dismissed the appeal.   The  Appellant  sought  and  was
    granted permission to appeal.

11. Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier by Judge Dineen,  on
    one ground only.  The relevant part of the grant reads as follows:

         "It is complained that at [12] the judge erred in law  in  treating
         entitlement to permanent residence as acquired by grant rather than
         being acquired as a matter of fact.  This is an  arguable  material
         error of law."

12. The Respondent served a Rule 24 response, the relevant  part  of  which
    reads as follows:

         "Whilst the judge may well have erred in terms of the consideration
         of the permanent residence of the EEA sponsor based on  the  facts,
         it  is  submitted  that  the  error  is  not  material  given   the
         appellant's concession that  there  was  no  evidence  of  the  EEA
         national exercising  treaty  rights  between  July  2009  and  2012
         (determination ï¿½12)."

    Thus, the matter comes before me to determine whether the  decision  of
    the FtTJ contained such error of law that it should be  set  aside  for
    material error and the decision remade.



Error of Law Hearing

13. Before me Mr Holt appeared for the Appellant,  Mrs  Pettersen  for  the
    Respondent.  At the outset of the hearing Mr Holt sought permission  to
    adduce fresh evidence under  Rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  This further evidence was in the form  of
    documentary evidence outlining the Appellant's son's  medical  history.
    Mr Holt asked that  this  evidence  be  admitted  as  it  was  evidence
    supporting the claim that the Sponsor came within the ambit of  Article
    7(3), in that she was temporarily  unable  to  work,  as  a  result  of
    looking after her ill child.  It was accepted that  this  evidence  was
    not before the First-tier Tribunal, the reason being that the Appellant
    had only recently been able  to  obtain  it  following,  what  Mr  Holt
    termed,  a  reconciliation  with  the  Sponsor.   Nevertheless  it  was
    evidence which was in existence at the date of decision and  which  was
    material to the Appellant's case.

14. Unfortunately, Mrs Pettersen had not had an  opportunity  to  see  this
    evidence.  She raised no objection to  the  application  however.   The
    evidence in question is clearly relevant  to  the  materiality  of  the
    issues before me and therefore the evidence was admitted under Rule  15
    above.

15. Mr Holt's submissions continued by saying that  the  FtTJ  had  clearly
    erred in her finding at [12] when she said that permanent residence was
    a form of status requiring a  grant,  rather  than  a  form  of  status
    acquired automatically on completion of five years'  lawful  residence.
    This finding meant that the FtTJ's approach  was  erroneous.   She  had
    turned away from the question of deciding  whether  the  Appellant  had
    shown in fact that his wife was lawfully exercising treaty  rights  for
    the relevant five year period.  It  had  always  been  the  Appellant's
    claim that his wife was exercising treaty rights.  Following the  birth
    of the children she had taken maternity leave and had then set up  work
    as a self-employed  hairdresser.   There  was  a  lack  of  documentary
    evidence relating to her  self-employment  because,  as  shown  by  the
    Appellant's  witness  statement  reinforced  by  the   fresh   evidence
    submitted under Rule 15, she had had to take time off in order to  look
    after her young child who was ill.

16.  Finally  the  Appellant  had  not  made  a  concession  in  the  terms
    categorised in the Rule 24  response.  The  Respondent  asserted  that,
    "there was no evidence of the EEA  national  exercising  treaty  rights
    between July 2009 and 2012." In fact there was evidence in the form  of
    the medical documentation and the Appellant's witness  statement.   The
    lack of consideration of material evidence for whatever reason  amounts
    to an error sufficient to mean that the decision should be set aside.

17. Mrs Pettersen in addition to relying on the Rule 24 response  submitted
    that the Article 7(3) point had been addressed by the judge.  The judge
    had said that she had  difficulty  "in  finding  that  the  Sponsor  is
    temporarily unable to work."  The medical evidence was not  before  the
    judge and therefore the judge could not be criticised for not referring
    to evidence which was not before her.  She accepted the principle  that
    the judge had erred in stating that permanent residence was acquired by
    grant rather than by fact.  At  this  point  Mrs  Pettersen  brought  a
    further matter to my attention.  I will deal with this below  following
    my consideration of the Error of Law submissions.

18. At the end of submissions, I reserved my decision,  which  I  now  give
    with reasons.





Consideration

19. I am satisfied, after hearing submissions from  the  parties  that  the
    decision of the FtT must be set aside for material error.

20. The FtTJ's misdirection in treating entitlement to permanent  residence
    as acquired by grant rather than as a matter of  fact  means  that  the
    opportunity for material evidence to be considered was  overlooked  and
    therefore the wrong approach to the evidence was taken. The  Respondent
    argues that had the judge taken the right approach it would  have  made
    no material difference because the evidence was not sufficient to  show
    that the Appellant's wife was exercising treaty rights.  That sounds an
    attractive argument but the difficulty with it is that before me  there
    is available evidence which is capable of showing that the  Appellant's
    wife was exercising Treaty Rights.

21. I find therefore I am satisfied that the decision must be set aside for
    material error and must be remade at a fresh hearing. This  is  on  the
    basis that there have been no findings of fact on whether  the  Sponsor
    is  lawfully  entitled  to  permanent  residence  (thus  entitling  the
    Appellant to the same  right  and  rendering  the  Revocation  decision
    unlawful).  The fresh evidence admitted for the purpose of this hearing
    will need to be properly evaluated.

22. During the course of submissions  I  canvassed  with  the  parties  the
    appropriate forum for the remaking of the decision in the event that  I
    found material error. Mr Holt's view was that  it  was  appropriate  to
    remit the matter to the FtT as the fact-finding Tribunal.

23. Mrs Pettersen was also of  the  view  that  remittal  to  the  FtT  was
    appropriate but for a different reason to that outlined by Mr Holt.   I
    return to the matter referred to by her in  paragraph  17  above.   She
    informed the parties that the Appellant had now made an application  to
    the Secretary of State for  Permanent  Residence  on  account  of  five
    years' continuous lawful residence, based on the same factors which are
    the subject of the instant appeal.  The Permanent Residence application
    had now been considered by the Secretary of  State  and  refused.   The
    Appellant has now exercised his right of appeal against  that  refusal.
    There is therefore an outstanding appeal which is yet to make  its  way
    through the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  reference  for  the  appeal  is
    EA/00153/2018.  She submitted that the  sensible  course  would  be  to
    remit the instant matter to the First-tier Tribunal  and  consideration
    should be given to linking the two appeals to be heard  together.   The
    evidence for both matters is clearly the same for the most part, and it
    would be invidious to have two separate hearings.

24. Mr Holt on hearing this agreed that this would be a  proper  course  to
    adopt.

25. I agree with the views of the parties.  I am satisfied  that  in  these
    circumstances, remittal to the FtT for a fresh hearing  on  the  appeal
    before me is the proper course. Consideration  can  then  be  given  to
    linking this appeal with reference EA/00153/2018.



Notice of Decision

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal, promulgated  on  7th  December
    2017 is hereby set aside for material error.  The matter  will  now  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  hearing  with  nothing
    being preserved from the original decision.  The fresh  hearing  should
    be before a judge other than Judge Myers.

27. No anonymity direction is made.
