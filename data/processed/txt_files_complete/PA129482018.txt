For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Order Regarding Anonymity  -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008


 1. Anonymity having previously been ordered in the First-tier Tribunal and
    there being no application to remove the order, I see no reason  to  do
    so and the order remains in place.  Unless  and  until  a  Tribunal  or
    court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report
    of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any
    member of their family.  This direction applies both to  the  Appellant
    and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply  with  this  direction  could
    lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The  Appellant  appeals  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    promulgated on 12th April 2019 whereby he dismissed the appeal  against
    the decision to refuse to grant asylum or ancillary protection.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted at the First-tier  Tribunal  by  Judge
    Saffer on 10th May 2019 including on the basis  that  it  was  arguable
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had rejected the credibility of  the
    appellant before taking account of the medical evidence contrary to the
    guidance of Mibanga [2005] EWCA Civ 367.  At the hearing before  me  Mr
    Tarlow conceded that the ground  was  made  out  on  the  face  of  the
    decision.  In those circumstances I indicated that I found an error  of
    law established and  set  the  decision  aside.  The  parties  were  in
    agreement that the case needs a complete rehearing with a fresh look at
    credibility  and  factual  findings.   In   those   circumstances   the
    representatives were agreed that I provide,  as  per  Rule  40  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules, a summary de  novo  remittal
    decision without reasoning.

Decision

 4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal reveals an error  of  law  such
    that it cannot stand. I set it aside and I remit the appeal de novo  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.


Signed                              Date 27 June 2019
