                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr I Graham for the Secretary of State
Miss S Jegarajah (counsel instructed by KP Nathan & Co) for the claimant

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator  (Miss  C  Griffith),
   sitting at  on 5 September 2002, allowing  an  asylum  and  human  rights
   appeal by a Tamil  citizen of Sri Lanka. The grounds of  appeal  suggest,
   among other things, that there is nothing to show that  this  case  falls
   into the exceptional category required for it to succeed, in terms of the
   Presidential decision in Jeyachandran [2002] UKIAT 01869.



2. Since those words were written, the situation has  changed  markedly  for
   the better: in the course of the third week of September 2002, the ban on
   the Tamil Tigers was lifted, and peace talks started between them and the
   government.  By  5  December,  those  talks  had  resulted  in  a   joint
   declaration, described by the BBC as a 'breakthrough', by the  government
   side as 'irreversible', and by the  Tamil  Tigers  as  'historic'.  While
   there is still no concluded peace agreement,  for  which  the  government
   would need a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and which  the  President
   still opposes, and while there may still be room  for  doubt  as  to  the
   Tamil Tigers' commitment to democracy in the areas they control, it  must
   be perfectly clear to any reasonable person that the tide of history  has
   turned, leaving many claims of this kind high and dry on  the  shores  of
   the past. There is certainly nothing to be gained from reference  to  any
   case heard before Jeyachandran came out on 10 June.  We  have  to  decide
   this case on an individual basis; but it must be even clearer than it was
   when Jeyachandran was heard that for such an appeal to succeed,  it  must
   indeed be exceptional: that  was  confirmed  in  Jeyabalan  [2002]  UKIAT
   05992.

3. The effect of Jeyachandran was considered  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
   Selvaratnam  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  121.  They  endorsed  the   approach   in
   Jeyachandran, though they took the view that it had  been  misapplied  in
   the case before them. The clearest explanation is per Peter Gibson LJ  at
   � 16:

   ... it is only in exceptional cases that a person returned to  Sri  Lanka
   will attract the attention of the authorities there and that such persons
   are likely to be limited to those who are wanted persons. The question is
   whether the case of the applicant is an  exceptional  case  as  a  person
   likely to be of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities and so  likely  to
   be detained, it being conceded that, once he  is  detained,  there  is  a
   substantial risk of persecution.

5. Miss Jegarajah's main argument was on Oleed [2002] EWCA Civ 1906. So  far
   as it is  possible  to  extract  a  general  ratio  from  three  separate
   judgments, one dissenting in part, it is this  (per  Schiemann  LJ,  with
   whom Aikens J expressed general agreement):

   I accept that the Tribunal examines the situation  in  the  country  from
   which the refugee is fleeing as at the date of its determination. However
   in the present case in my judgment  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  the
   adjudicator's determination, there was therefore no reason to  appeal  it
   and it would be wrong for the Home Secretary, on the back  of  an  appeal
   which has been dismissed, to seek to re-examine the threat to the refugee
   with reference to a date later than the adjudicator's determination.

   The reference to an appeal being dismissed is slightly  curious,  as  the
   adjudicator had allowed the  claimant's  appeal,  and  the  Tribunal  had
   allowed the Home Office appeal from that; but one can see what was meant.

6. The scope of this decision is made clear  by  the  fact  that  all  three
   judges indicated that they did not accept the submission of  counsel  for
   the claimant that any stricter test applied to Home Office  appeals  from
   an adjudicator than the "plainly wrong"  on  applicable  to  those  by  a
   claimant. As Oleed was a Home Office appeal, the point was  obiter;  but,
   while Arden LJ expressed no view on it, both Schiemann LJ  and  Aikens  J
   said they were "not presently persuaded" by it.  This  must  be  logical,
   since, as Schiemann LJ noted himself, and Miss Jegarajah reminded  us  in
   her skeleton argument, the Court of Appeal in Arshad [2001] EWCA Civ  587
   stressed the importance of an even-handed approach to both sides. At  the
   risk of stating the obvious, that  must  mean  even-handed  to  the  Home
   Office, as well as to the claimant.

7. The result is a rather surprizing one. None of the  Court  of  Appeal  in
   Oleed found it necessary to mention Ravichandran  [1996]  Imm  AR  97,  a
   decision of the same court which has been universally  followed  for  the
   last six years. No doubt they thought it was so well-established that  it
   could be taken for  granted,  as  the  oblique  reference  in  the  first
   sentence we have cited from Schiemann LJ suggests. But if  we  have  read
   Oleed  correctly,  what  remains  of  Ravichandran?  It  will  always  be
   necessary, whether on a Home Office or a claimant's appeal, not simply to
   consider the background situation at the date of the hearing  before  the
   Tribunal, but also that before the adjudicator, to see whether there  was
   "anything wrong" with it when made.

8. Can this twofold approach be reconciled  with  Ravichandran?  Or  with  �
   77.3 of the 1999 Act (in this case: see below), or � 102.2  of  the  2002
   Act, where that applies.

| |In considering-                                              |
| |(a) any ground mentioned in section 69, or                   |
| |(b) any question relating to the appellant's rights under    |
| |Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention,                    |
| |the appellate authority may take into account any evidence   |
| |which it considers to be relevant to the appeal (including   |
| |evidence about matters arising after the date on which the   |
| |decision appealed against was taken).                        |
| |                                                             |
| |(� 102.2 is in similar terms, but not limited to asylum or   |
| |human rights appeals: it specifically refers to matters      |
| |arising after the adjudicator's decision).                   |


9. Both these sections say the  Tribunal  may  (and  by  implication,  where
   relevant, should) consider relevant post-decision evidence. It is not for
   us to say how the question posed at 8 can be answered; but  the  problems
   resulting from the decision in Oleed are only too obvious. Is a  complete
   change of r�gime in the claimant's country of origin to be ignored? If in
   the claimant's favour (in the sense of the coming to power  of  a  r�gime
   hostile to him), then the result will be a fresh application for  asylum,
   and very likely further appeal proceedings. If  in  the  other  direction
   however, how is the Home Office to get a decision on the  true  facts  of
   the case? There does not seem to be any means open to them other than  an
   appeal to the Tribunal: see Saribal [2002] EWHC 1542 (Admin).

10. We are left to approach this case as best we can on the basis of  Oleed.
   The adjudicator certainly produced a very  well-set  out  and  considered
   decision. She said herself that it was a borderline  case;  but  did  she
   place it on the right side of the borderline? If she was "plainly  wrong"
   about that at the date of the hearing before her, then the appeal must be
   allowed. This claimant's history, so far as relevant, amounts to this:

   1996 - 1998    assisting Tamil Tigers at the front, as a medical orderly,
                 initially under duress, but with some weapons training, and
                 at one stage taking part in the fighting

   May - July 2000     detained by police in  Colombo,  with  ill-treatment,
                 as suspected Tamil Tiger, under the Prevention of Terrorism
                 Act; released on  the  intervention  of  the  International
                 Committee of the Red Cross, to sign on, which he does not

   August 2000 -  detained by  army  in  Vavuniya,  with  ill-treatment,  as
                 suspected
   August 2001    Tamil Tiger; released on bribe paid by his uncle  to  pro-
                 government militia, who kept him "in hiding" till  he  left
                 Sri Lanka in October


11. The first point taken against the adjudicator in the grounds  of  appeal
   is that the decision of the Tribunal  in  Tharmakulaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT
   03444 showed that persons released on bribe were unlikely to  be  of  any
   further interest to the authorities. That, said Miss Jegarajah, was shown
   to be wrong, at least in this case, by the fact that  this  claimant  had
   again been arrested the month after his release. The main fault with that
   argument is of course that on the claimant's first detention he had  been
   released on Red  Cross  intervention.  His  second  detention  was  in  a
   different part of the island, by a  different  section  of  the  security
   forces, and (of course like the first) before the current cease-fire.

12. The last point in the grounds, on the attitude apparently taken  by  the
   adjudicator to the claimant's scarring, is now accepted by Miss Jegarajah
   to be the result of a proof-reading error by the adjudicator, who clearly
   meant to say at � 19 that in itself it would not excite the attention  of
   the authorities. That leaves the main point, which is on the general line
   adopted by the adjudicator towards what was at the date of  the  decision
   the fast-changing background situation  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  adjudicator
   herself noted that the ban on the Tamil Tigers had just been lifted,  and
   concluded (� 20) that "The outlook for an end to their hostilities  looks
   promising although demanding of some caution".

13. The adjudicator then referred to  Jeyachandran,  before  coming  to  her
   conclusion on the facts of the individual case  (�  22)  that  it  was  a
   borderline one. Mr Graham challenged that, on the basis  that  one  could
   not have a borderline exceptional case; but we do  not  see  any  logical
   difficulty  with  that.  It   is   the   adjudicator's   application   of
   Jeyachandran, and the background evidence as it then was, to the facts of
   the individual case that we have to consider, bearing in  mind  that  she
   did not consider the consequences of the claimant being released on bribe
   from his second detention, as recommended  in  Tharmakulaseelan,  perhaps
   because she was not referred to that decision. (It  had  come  out  on  5
   August, but the copy before us shows it was  not  received  at  the  Home
   Office research unit till 9 September).

14. Even at  the  date  of  the  hearing  before  the  adjudicator,  as  she
   recognized, the guidelines in Jeyachandran required her to find that this
   was an exceptional case before the appeal could be  allowed.  Looking  at
   the basis (in � 22) on which  she  did  so,  we  cannot  agree  with  her
   assessment of the claimant's involvement in the Tamil  Tigers  as  having
   been "at a reasonably high level": he was a foot-soldier at most.

15. As for the claimant's having  been  "charged  under  the  Prevention  of
   Terrorism Act" in Colombo, the whole point about that  act  was  that  it
   allowed detention without charge: there is no question of such  detention
   having led to any still pending proceedings against him. At that stage it
   was still being vigorously used as  a  means  of  detaining  Tamil  Tiger
   suspects; but, though it was still on the statute book at the date of the
   hearing before the adjudicator, it is not suggested  that  it  was  still
   being used in that way, if at all.

16. The  adjudicator  then  went  on  to  consider  the  claimant's  lengthy
   detention at Vavuniya; but she did not consider, as  we  have  seen,  the
   guidance in Tharmakulaseelan as to the effect of his having been released
   on bribe. The question before  her  was  only  incidentally  whether  the
   claimant had been badly treated in the past, but mainly whether he  would
   be so on return.

17. Miss Jegarajah relied on the decision (by McCombe J  at  first  instance
   on judicial review of refusal of leave to appeal from an adjudicator)  in
   Paramanathan [2003] EWHC  484  Admin.  It  is  not  suggested  that  this
   claimant had ever confessed to Tamil Tiger membership, but that the  fact
   that he had been detained as such should  be  considered  as  equivalent.
   McCombe J did not go so far into the  factual  domain  of  the  appellate
   authorities as to suggest that Paramanathan's confession to  Tamil  Tiger
   membership before the ceasefire would put him at  risk  now,  but  simply
   took the view that in the circumstances the Tribunal chairman who refused
   leave ought not to have regarded the adjudicator's  conclusion  that  his
   subsequent release on bribe would have left no record on file as  one  he
   was entitled to make. We do not find the decision of any particular  help
   in the present case. Mr Graham has  not  suggested  that  the  claimant's
   detentions would have left no paper trail; merely that his final  release
   on bribe is most likely (as explained in Tharmakulaseelan) to  have  been
   recorded in some way that indicated that he was of no further interest.

18.  Conclusions   Since  we  are  obliged  by   Oleed   to   consider   the
   adjudicator's decision on this basis, we have to  say  that  we  do  find
   "something wrong" with the adjudicator's decision when it  was  made,  on
   the points noted at 13, 14 and 15 above. We think that together these led
   her to place this case,  which  she  herself  called  a  borderline  one,
   clearly on the wrong side of the line drawn in Jeyachandran (heard by the
   Tribunal over four months before she heard the present case) between  the
   exceptional and the unexceptional. Since we have found  a  mistaken  view
   was taken at the time, we are entitled to apply  Ravichandran,  note  the
   progress that has been made since then, and conclude  that  the  decision
   was plainly wrong on the merits of the situation  at  the  time  it  came
   before us.

19. That consideration of the substance of the decision leads  us  to  allow
   the appeal; but we should not like the adjudicator to think  that  we  do
   not appreciate the  decision's  real  merits.  Technically  speaking  (on
   presentation and general thoroughness) it is far  and  away  better  than
   most we see from adjudicators generally, and a great many from  those  of
   considerably more experience than we think  she  has.  Needless  to  say,
   those merits cannot make us shrink from our task of expressing  our  view
   on the substance; but that does need to be set in context.
