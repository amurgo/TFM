                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CANAVAN


                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                     J H
                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of the proceedings.  I  find  that
it is appropriate to continue the order. Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or
court directs otherwise, the original appellant (JH) is  granted  anonymity.
No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or
any member of his family. This direction applies both to the  appellant  and
to the respondent.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity I will refer to the parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically  the  Secretary  of
    State is the appellant before the Upper Tribunal.

2.    The appellant (JH) appealed the respondent's (SSHD) decision dated  25
    October 2017 to refuse a human rights claim in the context of automatic
    deportation proceedings.

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge M.A. Khan allowed the appeal in  a  decision
    promulgated on 11 May 2018.

4.    The Secretary of State made an in-time application for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, but it is unclear why it took so long for
    the Upper Tribunal to decide  the  application.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Norton-Taylor granted permission to appeal  in  an  order  sent  on  08
    October 2020.

5.    Upper Tribunal Judge Sheridan made further directions  on  09  October
    2020  in  response  to   correspondence   sent   by   the   appellant's
    representative to say that his ILR had been 'restored'. The  respondent
    subsequently filed a copy of a decision letter dated 10  June  2020  in
    which she stated that she was not going to pursue the revocation of his
    ILR. Further correspondence from the respondent to the  Upper  Tribunal
    dated 20 October 2020 stated that the Secretary of State was no  longer
    pursuing revocation of ILR. The Upper Tribunal was invited to treat the
    appeal  as  abandoned  under  section  104(4A)  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ('the NIAA 2002').

6.    Both parties have made written  submissions  asking  for  disposal  in
    light of the further decision made by the respondent on 10  June  2020.
    Neither party has suggested that it  is  necessary  to  deal  with  the
    matter by way of an oral hearing. In light of the  correspondence  from
    both parties I am satisfied that the appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal
    can be disposed of without a hearing with reference to rule 34  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  ('the  UT  Procedure
    Rules').

7.    I find that it is not  appropriate  to  dispose  of  the  appeal  with
    reference to section 104(4A) NIAA 2002 as suggested by the  respondent.
    The appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  has  not  been  brought  by  the
    appellant but by the respondent. There is already an extant  First-tier
    Tribunal decision in relation to the appeal brought  by  the  appellant
    against the decision to refuse a human rights claim. It is  clear  from
    the respondent's letter dated 20 October 2020 that she no longer  seeks
    to challenge the First-tier Tribunal decision. In any  event,  and  for
    the reasons highlighted in the post-script, it is questionable  whether
    the appellant has been 'granted leave to enter of  remain'  within  the
    meaning of section 104(4A).

8.    I find that the appropriate  way  to  dispose  of  the  appeal  is  by
    treating the respondent as having sought  permission  to  withdraw  her
    case with reference to rule 17 of the UT Procedure Rules.  The  parties
    appear to agree that the matter should be subject to disposal without a
    hearing.

9.    I consent to the Secretary of State withdrawing her  case  before  the
    Upper Tribunal. The effect of the withdrawal is that the  Secretary  of
    State no longer seeks to argue that the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    involved the making of an error on a point of law. The  decision  shall
    stand.

Post-script

10.   The respondent may need  to  consider  whether  it  is  sufficient  to
    merely state that she is no longer pursuing revocation of ILR in  order
    to give effect to the First-tier Tribunal decision. The  Supreme  Court
    decision in R (Fitzroy George) v SSHD [2014] UKSC 28  made  clear  that
    the effect of making a deportation order invalidated existing leave  to
    remain and that ILR was not subsequently revived. The decision in  this
    case was made in the context of the  automatic  deportation  provisions
    contained in the UK Borders Act 2007 ('the UKBA 2007'),  the  statutory
    scheme mandates the making of a deportation order, which was signed  on
    25 October 2017. In light of decision in  George,  the  respondent  may
    need to consider whether she needs to formally revoke  the  deportation
    order and issue a fresh grant of ILR. Whatever decision  is  made  must
    give lawful effect to the First-tier Tribunal decision.



DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making of an  error  on
    a point of law

The decision shall stand
