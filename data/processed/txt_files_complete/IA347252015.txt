                        (no anonymity direction made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on the 28th  September
         1989.  On the 8th June 2017 his appeal was dismissed by the  First-
         tier Tribunal on human rights grounds.

      2. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Grubb on the 15th February
         2018. Judge Grubb considered it arguable  that  there  had  been  a
         procedural  unfairness  in  the  hearing  before   the   First-tier
         Tribunal. It appeared from the file that unbeknownst to the  Judge,
         the Appellant had made an application for  an  adjournment  on  the
         grounds of ill-health.

      3. By way of Rule 24 response dated the 13th March 2018 the Respondent
         indicated that she  accepted  that  there  had  been  a  procedural
         irregularity. She invited the Upper Tribunal to set the decision of
         the First-tier Tribunal aside and to remit the matter  for  hearing
         de novo before a differently constituted First-tier Tribunal.

      4. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  J  Bartlett)  is
         therefore set aside by consent.   The matter shall be  remitted  to
         the First-tier Tribunal for hearing de novo before  a  judge  other
         than Judge Bartlett.

      5. I was not asked to make an order for anonymity and on the  facts  I
         see no reason to do so.

                                                             20th March 2018
