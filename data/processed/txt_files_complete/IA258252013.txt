                        ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   Representation:
   For the appellant:      Mr G Davison of  Counsel  instructed  by  Charles
   Simmons, Solicitors
   For the Respondent:     Miss Everett, Senior Presenting Officer


 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan. He was born on 8 January 1985.
    His application to remain in the UK as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  was
    refused by the respondent on 11 July  2013  under  Paragraph  245DD  of
    Immigration Rules. His appeal against the decision was heard  by  Judge
    Elvidge, a Judge of the First  tier  Tribunal.  It  was  dismissed  for
    reasons set out in the determination promulgated on 3 January 2014. The
    appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  31
    January 2014 y Judge Sommerville, a  Judge  of  the  First  tier  .  IN
    granting permission the Judge said,  "The  grounds  seeking  permission
    contend that the FTJ erred in applying table  5  paragraph  (d)  rather
    than Paragraph 45 and 46(e). This is arguable."


 2. At the hearing before me Mr Davison relying upon his written grounds of
    appeal asked that I find that the decision was  in  material  error  of
    law. Miss Everett agreed that the decision was indeed in material error
    of law as argued in the grounds of appeal.

 3. The parties asked that I remake the decision and allow  the  appeal  on
    its merits as the decision of the respondent had not been in accordance
    with the Immigration Rules.  Having read the reasons for refusal  given
    by the respondent for refusing the application and  there  having  been
    raised no new issue against  the  appellant,  I  allow  the  appeal  as
    requested by parties.

 4. The appeal is allowed.


FEE AWARD
I order a full  fee  award  as  in  my  view  the  decision  to  refuse  the
application made by the appellant was wrong on facts and in law.


ANONYMITY DIRECTION
None has been sought and circumstances of the case do not warrant such
direction.

Judge of the First Tier Tribunal sitting as Deputy Judge of the Upper
Tribunal.
