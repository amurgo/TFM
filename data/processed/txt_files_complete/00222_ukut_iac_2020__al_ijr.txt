            This judgment was handed down remotely by circulation
       to the parties' representatives by email at 4pm on 20 May 2020.

The Secretary of State's  Fee  Waiver  Guidance,  version  3,  was  unlawful
because it failed properly to reflect  the  settled  test,  of  whether  the
applicant is able to afford the fee.

Judge Blundell:

 1. The applicants are Ghanaian nationals. The first and second  applicants
    are the parents of the third, fourth and fifth applicants, who are twin
    sons aged nine and a daughter aged 5.  By a claim form which was issued
    on 25 April 2019, they sought judicial review of a decision made by the
    respondent on 25 January 2019, refusing their applications  for  a  fee
    waiver and therefore treating their applications for leave to remain as
    invalid.  The applicants submit that the  refusal  of  the  fee  waiver
    application was unlawful and that  the  respondent's  extant  published
    policy on such applications - Fee Waiver: Human Rights-based and  other
    specified applications, version 3.0 (dated 4 January 2019) - is  itself
    unlawful.

Factual Background

 2. The first applicant entered the United Kingdom at some point  in  2006.
    She held entry clearance as a Working  Holiday  Maker.   The  leave  to
    enter which was conferred by her entry clearance was valid until  2008,
    after which she overstayed.


 3. The second applicant also entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Working
    Holiday Maker.  He entered on 24 May 2005 and held leave  to  enter  in
    that capacity until May 2007.  On application, his leave  was  extended
    until 21 November 2007.  Upon the expiry of that  period  of  leave  to
    remain, he also overstayed.

 4. The third, fourth and fifth applicants were born in the United  Kingdom
    on 15 June 2010 and 14 July 2014 respectively.

 5. On 22 December 2018, the applicants applied  for  leave  to  remain  on
    Article  8  ECHR  grounds.   Their  applications  were  made  with  the
    assistance of a firm of representatives, the Refugee and Migrant  Forum
    of Essex and London ("RAMFEL").  The  FLR  (FP)  application  form  was
    accompanied by a detailed covering letter from RAMFEL and a  volume  of
    supporting evidence.  It was submitted, in summary, that it would be  a
    breach of Article 8 ECHR to remove the family from the United  Kingdom.
    Reliance was particularly placed on the best interests of the  children
    and it was submitted that the older  two  children  had  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom for more than seven years  and  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect them to  leave  (paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
    Immigration Rules refers).

Application for Fee Waiver

 6. The letter from RAMFEL also contained a section about  the  applicants'
    ability to pay the fees for the  applications,  which  totalled  �7665,
    including the Immigration Health Surcharge.  That section of the letter
    was in the following terms:


         Despite this  positive  contribution  though,  our  client  and  Mr
         Acheampong have struggled desperately due  to  their  inability  to
         work and provide for their children.  Their church  have  supported
         them with intermittent financial  support  and  provided  food  and
         clothing, but as they confirm in their supporting  statements  they
         cannot assist the family with the fees for this application.


         Aside  from  support  from  friends,  amounting  to  no  more  than
         relatively small cash donations, the family have no regular  source
         of income and depend on the  food  bank  run  by  the  organisation
         representing them in this application.  They are  also  not  paying
         for legal advice and RAMFEL are acting pro-bono in this matter.


         The family  currently  reside  at  [...].   This  accommodation  is
         provided by a family friend and the family make irregular  payments
         only rather than paying consistent rent.  They  previously  resided
         at [...] and Mr Acheampong's bank statements  are  still  addressed
         here as he has yet to update his details with the bank.


         It is submitted that there is no prospect of the family raising the
         funds for this application -  �7665  with  the  Immigration  Health
         Surcharge - within the foreseeable future, ie 12 months and on this
         basis a fee waiver should be granted.  Account statements  for  all
         bank accounts held by the family, as well as credit cards  held  by
         our client, are enclosed.  Our client has a savings account and  an
         ISA with Barclays, but she does not receive  statements  for  these
         accounts.  However, her current account statements  show  that  the
         balance for her savings account has remained consistently at  �0.00
         whilst the ISA's balance stands at �0.01.  It  is  clear  that  our
         client and her  partner  have  no  meaningful  income,  and  it  is
         repeated that there is no prospect of them raising  the  funds  for
         this application.


         In summary, it is submitted that our client  qualifies  for  a  fee
         waiver  due  to  her  inability  to  raise  the  funds   for   this
         application...

 7. Also submitted to the respondent with  Form  FLR(FP)  was  a  completed
    Appendix 1: Request for a Fee Waiver.  The rubric at the start of  that
    form included sections in the following terms:


         You should only complete this form if you are seeking a fee  waiver
         because you think you meet the published fee waiver  policy.   This
         will be because you are destitute,  or  because  you  would  become
         destitute if you paid the fee (in respect of your  own  application
         or one or more of your dependants included in the application),  or
         because  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  relating  to  your
         financial circumstances which mean that you are unable to  pay  the
         fee for your application (or for  that  of  one  or  more  of  your
         dependants).


         [...]


         The decision on whether you qualify for a fee waiver will  be  made
         on the basis of the information you provide in this  form  and  the
         evidence submitted with it.  It is your responsibility  to  provide
         sufficient information and evidence to demonstrate that you qualify
         for a fee waiver.


         You will need to provide documentary evidence with this fee  waiver
         application  to  demonstrate  your  financial  circumstances.   The
         nature of this evidence will  vary  according  to  your  individual
         circumstances, but some examples of relevant documents you may wish
         to include are listed below.

 8. There then followed a list of the types of evidence which might support
    the application for a fee waiver.  The applicants indicated  that  they
    were submitting four types of evidence: bank  statements  covering  the
    period of  six  months  prior  to  the  application;  savings  accounts
    statements for the same period; letters from a  registered  charity  or
    Local Authority confirming receipt of support; and other documents  (as
    described in RAMFEL's covering letter).


 9. In section 1 of the application form, the applicants left  unchecked  a
    box next to the statement 'I am destitute'.  They checked the box  next
    to the statement 'I am not destitute but I would become destitute if  I
    paid the application fee'.  Also  checked  was  the  box  next  to  the
    following statement:

         I am not destitute and would not become destitute  if  I  paid  the
         application fee, but I have exceptional circumstances  relating  to
         my financial circumstances which mean I am unable to  pay  the  fee
         for my own application and all of the dependants  included  in  the
         application.

10. In the section of the form  which  asked  for  an  explanation  of  the
    answers to those questions, the  applicants'  solicitor  had  placed  a
    stamp which stated "See cover letter", referring  to  the  letter  from
    which I have quoted above.  The form was filled out with various  other
    details.  At section 2,  the  first  applicant  provided  her  personal
    details including her National Insurance number.  Section  3  contained
    the personal details of the remaining applicants.


11. At section 4, the applicants provided details of  their  accommodation,
    stating that they had lived there since September 2017  and  that  they
    had not been asked  to  leave  the  property.   They  stated  that  the
    property was neither owned nor rented but that it  was  provided  by  a
    friend.  They stated that they made a 'variable' contribution to  their
    accommodation costs.  In answer to a question about whether or not they
    received other financial support, including  from  a  Local  Authority,
    they answered in the negative.  At the foot of the page on  which  that
    question  was  asked,  the  applicants  were   requested   to   provide
    documentary evidence such as annotated  bank  statements  and  payslips
    from the third party from whom support was received.   At  the  end  of
    section 4, the applicants stated that they were not homeless and  would
    not become homeless shortly.

12. Section 5 of the form is entitled 'Your Financial Details'.  It  begins
    with an emboldened paragraph which reads as follows:

         Please note we require evidence of your  finances,  including  bank
         statements,  building  society  savings  books  or   other   formal
         documentation in support of your application for a fee waiver.  The
         evidence  should  cover  the  six  month  period  prior   to   your
         application being submitted.  If  you  are  being  supported  by  a
         friend or relative, we require written evidence in the  form  of  a
         letter confirming this,  with  formal  documentation  showing  that
         person's financial resources.  If you  are  being  supported  by  a
         registered charity or a Local Authority,  we  also  require  formal
         documentation to evidence this.  Please  provide  full  details  of
         exactly what the support consists of, why you are eligible for such
         support and when the support began.

13. The applicants  then  stated  that  they  had  received  'intermittent'
    support from friends since arriving in the UK.  The  first  applicant's
    sister in Belfast had also provided support previously.  In  answer  to
    question 5.2, the applicants stated that they  were  unable  to  borrow
    money for the application fee from family and/or friends.  A  statement
    at 5.4 of the form requested  applicants  who  were  already  receiving
    financial  support  from  family  or  friends  to  provide  documentary
    evidence to confirm whether they were able to  borrow  the  application
    fee from those individuals.


14. A series of questions then sought to elicit information  regarding  the
    potential sources of funding not covered  previously.   The  applicants
    stated that they were not receiving support from a former  partner  and
    that they had not received compensation or damages. The  only  non-cash
    asset they had was a television which was worth about �100.   At  5.11,
    the applicants stated that they had attached bank  statements  for  the
    accounts they held in the UK. At 5.14-5.17, they  indicated  that  they
    had no income from employment or potential employment.

15. Section 6 of the form is concerned with  the  amount  of  public  funds
    received by an applicant, if any.  The applicants stated that they were
    not receiving any of the 21 different types  of  public  funds  listed.
    Section 7 asked about the second applicant's financial situation.  Each
    of these boxes was marked to indicate that  he  had  no  employment  or
    assets.  At 7.8, reference was made to his bank statements having  been
    appended to the form.  Section 8 asked for any  additional  information
    which was thought to be relevant.  The applicants' solicitor had  again
    stamped this section "See cover letter". At section 9,  the  applicants
    were required to provide a  summary  of  their  monthly  incomings  and
    outgoings.  In the former column, they  indicated  that  they  received
    variable assistance from family  and  friends.   No  other  sources  of
    income were stated.  In the latter column, the applicants  stated  that
    they paid gas and household bills (gas, electricity and water) of  �160
    and that they paid for the children's school meals, at a cost of �92.


16. The form concluded with two places for the first applicant's signature.
     Above the first was an emboldened warning that "All  figures  on  this
    form must be supported with evidence/documentation".  Above the  second
    was a declaration section, containing warnings in familiar terms, about
    the importance of providing accurate information and  the  consequences
    of failing to do so.  There was then a box, underneath  the  place  for
    the applicant's signature, which contained this:


         Any friend, relative or other party whom the applicant  has  stated
         will provide financial support and/or is a joint customer with  the
         applicant with a bank or utility company must ensure that they have
         also completed the  consent  for  verification  checks  declaration
         which is included in the relevant leave to remain application form.



17. On the final page of the 25 page form, the applicants checked boxes  to
    indicate that they had completed all sections of the form; enclosed all
    documentary evidence  required  by  the  form;  and  enclosed  a  fully
    completed application for leave to remain.


18. Evidence which bore on  the  application  for  a  fee  waiver  and  the
    application for leave to remain  was  submitted  with  the  application
    forms.  The evidence which related to the application for a fee  waiver
    was as follows: (i) the first applicant's Barclays Bank current account
    statement  from  November  2017  to  December  2018;  (ii)  the   first
    applicant's current account mini-statement from 30 October 2018  to  15
    December 2018; (iii)  the  second  applicant's  Barclays  Bank  current
    account statement from November 2017 to November 2018; (iv)  the  first
    applicant's Marks & Spencer credit card statement for May to  September
    2018; and (v) the first applicant's Tesco  credit  card  statement  for
    April 2018 to October 2018.  I  should  note  (as  did  RAMFEL  in  the
    covering letter) that the Barclays statements also sought to provide an
    overview of the adult applicants' finances, in that they also gave  the
    balance of their ISA accounts, which were �0.01 and �0.00 respectively.



Decision Under Challenge

19. In her decision of 25 January 2019,  the  respondent  stated  that  the
    applicants did not qualify for  a  fee  waiver  because  'you  are  not
    considered to be destitute, you have not demonstrated that you would be
    rendered destitute by payment of the fee, and it is not considered that
    there are exceptional circumstances in your case such that a fee waiver
    should be granted'.  The reasoning in support of  that  conclusion  was
    expressed over the course of the following page of the decision.  Given
    the nature of this claim, it is necessary to set out that reasoning  in
    full.  (The paragraph numbering does not appear in the original; I have
    added it for subsequent ease of reference.)

         (1) We have considered your application against all  parts  of  the
         fee waiver policy.  We have considered whether you are destitute.


         (2) You have stated that you have access to accommodation  provided
         by your friend and you have made no representations to  the  effect
         that this accommodation is inadequate.  Therefore  it  is  accepted
         that you have access to adequate accommodation.


         (3) You have stated that you are able to meet your essential living
         needs through the support from your family/friends. Therefore it is
         accepted that you are able to meet your essential living needs.


         (4) As a result,  we  have  not  received  sufficient  evidence  to
         demonstrate that you are destitute.


         (5) We have considered whether you would become  destitute  if  you
         paid the application fee or whether you could borrow  the  required
         amount from family or friends.


         (6) We acknowledge the bank statements  provided  for  the  account
         ending [...].  However, in order to assess your  disposable  income
         and whether your financial circumstances have changed  recently  we
         require bank statements for all of your accounts covering a  period
         of six months with all major  and  regular  incoming  and  outgoing
         payments explained.  The bank  statements  you  provided  were  not
         sufficient for our purposes as they were not fully  explained,  for
         example the Barclays statement ending [...]  showed  a  deposit  of
         �250 on 26 March 2018, �360 deposit on 13 April 2018, �300  deposit
         from Richard Abebrese on 9 July 2018,  �200  deposit  from  Richard
         Abebrese on 1 October 2018.  There was  a  total  amount  of  �2550
         deposit [sic] from E Acheampong throughout the period of  the  bank
         statements, all of which were not annotated.


         (7) Also, you submitted statements  for  Santander  account  ending
         [...] from 30 October  2018  -  15  December  2018,  you  have  not
         submitted six months consecutive statements for this account.


         (8) As a result, we are unable to assess whether  or  not  you  are
         able to pay the fee now.


         (9) Any support provided by others should be evidenced  by  letters
         from the  friend,  family  member  or  organisation  providing  it,
         detailing what support is  provided  and  whether  or  not  it  can
         continue.  You claim to receive support from your friend.  We  have
         not received sufficient evidence  to  confirm  you  are  unable  to
         borrow the fee from that source.


         (10) Therefore,  you  have  not  provided  sufficient  evidence  to
         demonstrate that you have no additional disposable income such that
         you could either: pay the fee now without compromising your ability
         to accommodate yourself adequately or  meet  your  other  essential
         living needs, or that you have no ability to  borrow  the  required
         amount from family or friends.  Finally,  there  is  no  basis  for
         concluding that your financial circumstances are likely to  change.
         As a result we do not consider that you would be rendered destitute
         by payment of the fee.


         (11)  Consideration  has  also  been  given  as  to   whether   any
         exceptional  circumstances  exist  relating   to   your   financial
         circumstances and ability to pay the fee.  You  have  not  provided
         any  evidence   to   demonstrate   that   there   are   exceptional
         circumstances relating to your financial circumstances and  ability
         to pay the fee.


         (12) Consideration has  also  been  given  to  section  55  of  the
         Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 (duty  regarding  the
         welfare of children).  We have considered  the  best  interests  of
         your children.  We note that  your  children  currently  has  [sic]
         access to adequate accommodation provided by your friend  and  that
         their other essential living needs are being met  by  support  from
         friends/family.


         (13) For the reasons set out above, the Secretary of State does not
         consider that you meet the criteria for the grant of a  fee  waiver
         and your application for a fee waiver is therefore rejected.

20. The letter continued by reminding the applicants that  they  could  re-
    apply for  leave  to  remain,  and  that  they  could  make  a  further
    application for a fee waiver, but that up to  date  evidence  would  be
    required in support of any such applications.  There was  then  a  sub-
    heading entitled 'Liability to Removal', in which the  applicants  were
    informed that they could be detained or placed on reporting  conditions
    and that they would be liable to enforced removal to Ghana if they  did
    not leave the United Kingdom 'as required'.  That section of the letter
    concluded by stating, in bold,  that  the  applicants  would  be  given
    further notice of when they would be removed.  After that section,  and
    before the part of the  letter  in  which  the  applicants  were  given
    contact details of the Voluntary Departure Service, there  was  a  list
    entitled 'Consequences of staying in  the  UK  unlawfully'.   Given  Mr
    Mackenzie's reliance on the Home Office's 'hostile environment'[1],  it
    is necessary to set out that list in full.


         If you stay in the UK without leave
         . You can be detained
         . You can be prosecuted, fined and imprisoned
         . You can be removed and banned from returning to the UK
         . You will not be allowed to work
         . You will not be able to rent a home

21. On 9  February  2019,  RAMFEL  sent  a  Letter  Before  Action  to  the
    respondent, challenging the rejection of  the  application  for  a  fee
    waiver.  It was submitted that the  total  fee  for  the  five  FLR(FP)
    applications, including the Immigration Health Surcharge  ("IHS"),  was
    �7665 and that  there  had  been  clear  evidence  submitted  that  the
    applicants would be unable to raise the fee.  In the circumstances,  it
    was submitted  that  the  decision  was  unreasonable,  irrational  and
    unlawful, when set against the fee waiver guidance.  The  letter  cited
    the decision of Stewart J  in  R  (Carter)  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWHC  2603
    (Admin), to which I will return, and traced the development of the  fee
    waiver guidance from the date of that decision.  It was  accepted  that
    the applicants were not destitute.  It was submitted  that  they  would
    become destitute if required to pay the fee  or,  in  the  alternative,
    that they met the third  limb  of  the  respondent's  test,  which  was
    described as 'exceptional circumstances ... that justify the grant of a
    fee waiver'.  The applicants' financial circumstances were evaluated at
    length and it was submitted, in summary, that no  reasonable  Secretary
    of State could have concluded that the 'exceptional circumstances' limb
    of the policy did not apply.  It was also submitted that  the  decision
    was contrary to the respondent's obligations under section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.


22. On 26 February 2019, the respondent  responded  to  the  Letter  Before
    Action, stating that the decision under challenge would be  maintained.
    She did not accept that the guidance had been applied incorrectly; that
    she had failed to consider the applicants' circumstances as a whole; or
    that the decision breached section 55.

Procedural Background

23. This claim was initially issued on 25 April  2019.   Time  having  been
    extended for the respondent to reply,  she  filed  Summary  Grounds  of
    Defence on 30 May 2019.  By a consent order which was sealed on 23 July
    2019, however, the parties  agreed  that  the  applicants  should  have
    permission to amend  their  grounds.   It  was  therefore  the  amended
    grounds upon which Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup granted  permission  (on
    the papers) on 15 November 2019.  In the circumstances,  I  propose  to
    make no further reference to the original grounds.  The amended grounds
    may at this stage be summarised as follows:


     i) The Fee Waiver guidance, version 3, is unlawful in that it fails  to
        implement the decisions in R (Omar) v SSHD [2012] EWHC 3448  (Admin)
        and R (Carter) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 2603 (Admin), presents unnecessary
        obstacles to an individual's right to be  granted  leave  to  remain
        under Article 8 ECHR,  and  is  contrary  to  s55  of  the  Borders,
        Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 ("the 2009 Act").


    ii) The respondent's decision on the facts  is  unlawful,  in  that  the
        respondent failed to ask herself the  correct  question,  which  was
        whether  the  applicants  could  in  practice  pay  the  fee.    The
        respondent could not rationally conclude, on  the  facts,  that  the
        applicants were able to do so.

24. There were also lengthy submissions which  responded  to  a  particular
    point ("the Ahsan argument") taken in the respondent's Summary  Grounds
    of Defence, which were settled by Mr Malik  of  counsel.   Since  those
    submissions did not amount to a ground of challenge,  and  given  their
    prominence in the submissions made before me orally and in  writing,  I
    propose to return to them in due course.


25. Judge Pickup rehearsed the competing arguments in  some  detail  before
    concluding materially as follows:


         In summary, for the reasons set out  above,  it  is  arguable  that
         insofar as the Fee Waiver  Policy  may  exclude  those  who  cannot
         afford to pay the fees but who do not qualify  under  the  policy's
         definition of destitute/destitution, it is unreasonable, irrational
         or unlawful.  If the policy is to be applied inflexibly, it is also
         arguably an unlawful fetter on discretion to  waive  fees.   It  is
         arguable that even though the  policy  has  been  amended  to  take
         account of Omar and Carter, the focus on either destitution or,  in
         the  alternative,  exceptional  circumstances  still  fails  to  be
         compatible with the Convention.

Legislative Scheme

26. The relevant provisions are not in issue between the parties  and  much
    of what follows  is  taken  directly  from  [16]-[23]  of  the  amended
    grounds.


27. By s68 of the Immigration Act 2014 ("the 2014 Act"), the respondent has
    power to require a fee for an application for leave to remain.  Section
    68(2) provides that the functions in respect of which fees  are  to  be
    charged are to be specified by the Secretary of  State  by  order.   By
    s68(7), the amount to be charged for any particular function is  to  be
    set by  the  Secretary  of  State  by  regulations.   By  s68(10),  the
    Secretary of State is empowered to permit, by way of  regulations,  the
    reduction, waiver or refund of  part  or  all  of  a  fee  (whether  by
    conferring a discretion or otherwise).


28. Article 4(1) of the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2016 ("the
    Fees Order"), as amended, provides that a fee is to be charged for  the
    consideration of an application for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

29. By paragraph 1 of schedule 2 to the Immigration and Nationality  (Fees)
    Regulations 2018 ("the Fees Regulations"), applications such  as  those
    made by the applicant (in reliance on Article 8 ECHR)  are  defined  as
    specified human rights applications.  As a result of  Table  6  of  the
    same regulations,  the  fee  for  such  an  application  is  �1033  per
    applicant.   An  additional  fee,  or  surcharge,  is  imposed  by  the
    Immigration (Health Charge) Order 2015 which,  at  the  material  time,
    stood at �500 per applicant.

30. By regulation 16 of the Fees Regulations, the Secretary  of  State  may
    reject an application as invalid or request  an  applicant  to  pay  an
    outstanding fee where that person is required to pay a fee specified in
    the Regulations but has failed to do so.  The fee may however be waived
    in accordance with paragraph 9.4 of Table 9 of  the  Fees  Regulations,
    which provides as follows:

         No  fee  is  payable  in  respect  of  a  specified  human   rights
         application  where  to  require  payment   of  the  fee  would   be
         incompatible with the applicant's Convention rights.

R (Omar) v SSHD and R (Carter) v SSHD

31. Two decisions reached by judges in the Administrative Court are said by
    Mr Mackenzie to be  particularly  relevant  to  my  assessment  of  the
    lawfulness of the current Fee Waiver policy.


32. The first of those decision is that of Beatson J (as he then was) in  R
    (Omar) v SSHD [2012]  EWHC  3448  (Admin);  [2013]  Imm  AR  601.   The
    claimant in that case had succeeded in his appeal against a deportation
    order, with the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  concluding  that  his
    deportation to Cameroon would be a  breach  of  Article  8  ECHR:  [6].
    Limited leave was eventually granted to him and he applied for  further
    leave before its expiry: [10].  He contended  that  he  should  not  be
    required to pay a fee or, in the alternative,  that  any  fee  for  the
    application should be waived in  his  particular  circumstances:  [12]-
    [13].   The  respondent  refused  to  consider  the  application.   Her
    position,  although  not  expressly  stated  in  the   decision   under
    challenge, was that she was positively  unable,  as  a  result  of  the
    regulations then in force, to waive the requirement for  a  fee:  [14].
    The claimant (who was also represented by Mr Mackenzie) submitted  that
    the refusal to consider the  application  was  unlawful  and  that  the
    regulations  then  in  force  were  ultra  vires  section  51  of   the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (the predecessor provision
    to s68 of the 2014 Act): [15] and [63]

33. By the time the application came before Beatson J,  the  defendant  had
    granted the claimant thirty months' discretionary leave to remain.  For
    reasons he gave at [35]-[61], Beatson J did not accept  that  this  had
    rendered the claim academic because, in  particular,  the  question  of
    whether a discretion to waive  the  fee  must  exist  in  law  remained
    outstanding: [60]. Nor did he accept the primary submission made by the
    Secretary of State, which was that there was no prospect of an  Article
    8 ECHR breach because the Secretary of State had a  residual  power  to
    grant leave to remain of her own motion and because  there  were  other
    ways in which a claimant could  obtain  leave  without  making  a  paid
    application: [70].  To wait for the respondent to grant  leave  of  her
    own motion was a  "deeply  unattractive"  solution,  since  that  would
    confine an individual to a "grey hole" of uncertainty and  expose  them
    to potential prosecution under s24 of the Immigration Act  1971:  [72].
    Ultimately, Beatson J concluded, at [82], that

         The  requirement  in  regulations  6  and  30  of  the  2010   Fees
         Regulations that, in this class of case, a fee must be paid,  there
         is no provision for waiver and an application without a fee "is not
         validly made" must, in the light of section 3 , be read subject  to
         a qualification that the specified fee is not due where to  require
         it to be paid would be  incompatible  with  a  person's  Convention
         rights.

34. So it was that the words "except where that would be incompatible  with
    a Convention right' were to be read into the regulations then in force:
    [83].  Although the Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal
    against Beatson J's decision, she did not pursue the appeal.  It is  as
    a result of the decision in Omar that paragraph 9.4 of Table 9  of  the
    2018 Fees Regulations (as set out above) is worded as it is.


35. It was in response to the decision in Omar that the Secretary of  State
    introduced the first of three Fee Waiver polices in September 2013.  It
    was then to be found in the Immigration Directorate Instructions.   The
    policy made express reference to Beatson J's decision, and to  [82]  in
    particular.  The test for granting an application for a fee waiver  was
    described at 1.1.1 of the policy:

         Applicants will qualify for  a  fee  waiver  only  where  they  can
         demonstrate on  the  basis  of  evidence  provided  that  they  are
         destitute, or where there are exceptional circumstances.

36. The policy  adopted  the  definition  of  destitution  in  s95  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, under which the respondent may provide
    or arrange support for asylum-seekers  and  their  dependants  who  are
    destitute or likely to become destitute.  The statutory  definition  is
    as follows:


            (3)  For the purposes of this section, a person is destitute if-
              (a) he does not have adequate accommodation or any means of
                  obtaining it (whether or not his other essential living
                  needs are met); or
              (b)     he has adequate accommodation or the means of
                  obtaining it, but cannot meet his other essential living
                  needs.


37. The 2013 policy was challenged in R (Carter) v SSHD  [2014]  EWHC  2603
    (Admin).   The  respondent  had  refused  to  waive  the  fee  for  the
    claimant's human rights application (�578) because he  lived  with  his
    grandmother, who gave him �20 per week spending money.   As  a  result,
    the defendant did not accept that 'your client meets the definition  of
    destitution and is not eligible for a fee exemption'.


38. Having set out the facts of the applicant's case and the relevant legal
    provisions, Stewart J considered Beaton J's decision in Omar.   He  set
    out excerpts from [3], [13], [64],  [68]-[69]  and  [82]-[83]  of  that
    judgment before turning to the way in which the claimant put his  case,
    which he summarised at [16] in the following way:

         (i) The crucial point is that he cannot afford the fee. If that  is
         the case then,  irrespective  of  whether  he  meets  the  test  of
         destitution or exceptional circumstances in Appendix 1 FLR(O),  his
         Article 8 rights are breached.


         (ii) The evidence clearly establishes that C is  unable  to  afford
         the fee in that he receives a maximum cash  allowance  of  �20  per
         week, well below the minimum sum stipulated by law to be  necessary
         for a single person of his age to live upon  -  the  single  person
         allowance for income support is �56.80 per week.


         (iii) The refusal by D to process C's application to regularise his
         status in the UK is  an  ongoing  breach  of  Article  8.  This  is
         regardless of the fact that D has  taken  no  steps  to  remove  C.
         Article 8 encompasses the right to develop as a person.  C  has  no
         permission to work and claim benefits. He would find  it  difficult
         to pursue higher  education/vocational  training.  Therefore  C  is
         being forced by D's decision to subsist below the poverty line. D's
         decision results interferes with C's personal autonomy and right to
         self determination and therefore  interferes  with  his  Article  8
         rights. These rights can only properly be  given  effect  to  by  a
         grant of status in the UK; a promise not to remove a person pending
         some further event is insufficient  of  recognition  of  Article  8
         rights. C is entitled to a decision about his rights to  reside  in
         the UK. He is being deprived of this because  his  application  has
         been rejected for want of the fee which he cannot pay.


39. Stewart J then noted that the defendant relied on  R  (Sheikh)  v  SSHD
    [2011] EWHC 3390 (Admin).  (Although judgment in that case  was  handed
    down by Sales J  (as  he  then  was)  in  December  2011,  it  was  not
    considered in Omar, which was heard nearly a year later.)   Sheikh  was
    an entry clearance case, on the facts of which Sales  J  had  concluded
    that it was lawful for the defendant to require that  a  fee  be  paid.
    Whilst Stewart J was cautious about the different context in which  the
    two challenges were brought, he did accept that the  following  section
    of [74] of Sales J's judgment translated into the circumstances he  was
    considering:


         It is fair and proportionate to the legitimate interests identified
         in Article 8(2) for state authorities to focus attention  primarily
         on the ability of an applicant to pay the relevant fee. If there is
         no great difficulty in them raising funds to pay the fee there will
         be no tenable  case  under  Article  8  for  the  Applicant  to  be
         exempted.


40. The defendant sought, in addition, to rely on an additional section  of
    [74] of Sales J's judgment in Sheikh.  In  [74](10)  of  his  judgment,
    Sales J  had  stated  that  it  would  be  relevant,  in  assessing  an
    application for a fee waiver, to consider the strength and force of the
    underlying claim.  Stewart J did  not  consider  the  strength  of  the
    underlying claim to be relevant in the case before him, since he had to
    consider  the  issue  of  principle,  which  was  "if  someone  has   a
    potentially valid claim for LTR, is D's policy unlawful?": [20].


41. Having recorded at [22] that there was a measure of  agreement  between
    the parties, Stewart J stated that the critical point was  whether  the
    Fee Waiver policy was incompatible with a Convention right, noting that
    "[s]o long as the policy is not so incompatible, D is entitled to adopt
    a rigorous approach to the question of fees": [23].  In support of that
    latter statement,  Stewart  J  footnoted  four  authorities,  including
    Sheikh. He also noted that it  was  reasonable  and  proportionate  for
    those who claimed to be destitute to be required to provide evidence as
    to their finances, rather than expecting caseworkers to make their  own
    enquiries: [24].  At [25], Stewart J accepted a submission made by  the
    defendant that a policy should provide 'clear  objective  guidance'  to
    caseworkers considering such applications and that unless that guidance
    was 'clear and objective, transparency, consistency and fairness may be
    compromised'.


42. At [26], Stewart J identified two major problems with the policy.   The
    first ("the narrow point") was that there was an internal inconsistency
    in the policy, whereby a person in receipt of NASS support because they
    were destitute would be in a preferable position to a  person  who  was
    not destitute but who had no greater ability to pay the  fee  than  the
    NASS recipient.  The second problem, which Stewart J described as  "the
    wider point", was this:


         In any event, the heart of the matter is what is the true ratio  of
         Omar? To what extent does Omar  assist  in  determining  where  the
         incompatibility with a Convention right arises? D's  submission  is
         that the policy is entirely consistent with the ratio because "this
         class of case" means a person who is destitute or in  receipt  only
         of NASS support.  (I  note  that  D's  Skeleton  Argument  did  not
         initially include the words "in receipt only of NASS  support").  I
         do not accept that the ratio is so limited. I note  from  paragraph
         13 of Omar, the Claimant's submission in that  case  that  "in  the
         light of the minimum  funds  granted  by  NASS,  he  did  not  have
         sufficient funds to pay the fee." It seems to me that if  a  person
         demonstrates upon proper proof that they cannot pay the fee, then a
         policy which does not provide for waiver in those circumstances  is
         incompatible with a Convention right. [emphasis added]

43. Stewart J pressed counsel for the defendant  about  the  ambit  of  the
    'exceptional circumstances' part of the policy, which appeared  to  him
    to be circumscribed very closely.  Counsel for the  defendant  returned
    after the short adjournment with a position statement in which  it  was
    accepted that "if a person were able to prove with sufficient  evidence
    of satisfactory quality that their financial  position  was  such  that
    were they to pay the  application  fee,  they  would  be  left  without
    sufficient funds to meet their essential living needs and would thereby
    be rendered destitute within the meaning  of  the  policy,  this  could
    amount to exceptional circumstances."  In undertaking that  assessment,
    the defendant stated that she would consider all the  circumstances  of
    the case including the assets  available  to  the  individual  and  any
    relevant third parties.


44. Stewart J  did  not  consider  this  to  reflect  the  reality  of  the
    situation; it was not a  question  of  the  individual  being  rendered
    destitute by paying the fee.  He observed that "[s]uch a  person  would
    not be able to get their hands on the hundreds of pounds  necessary  to
    pay the fee": [27].  Nor, in any event, did  the  defendant's  position
    appear  to  be  in  accordance   with   the   policy   on   exceptional
    circumstances, the introduction to the policy, or  the  rubric  on  the
    application form (which referred only to destitution).   Nor  did  this
    position  provide  a  satisfactory  answer  to  the  position  of   the
    individual who was not in receipt of NASS support but who was no better
    off than a recipient of that support.  At [33],  Stewart  J  granted  a
    declaration in the following terms:

         I therefore declare  that  the  Policy  is  unlawful  in  that  the
         decision to refuse to  waive  the  application  fee  based  on  the
         destitution criteria and exceptional circumstances (as described in
         paragraph 7 of  the  2013  Directions)  is  incompatible  with  the
         Article 8 Rights  of  a  person  such  as  C,  who  is  within  the
         jurisdiction and who has an  arguable  private/family  life  within
         Article 8(1) ECHR.

45. Stewart J granted the Secretary of State permission to  appeal  against
    his decision and stayed the effect  of  it  until  resolution  of  that
    appeal.  In the event, the Secretary of State chose not to  pursue  the
    appeal to the Court of Appeal.  Instead, on 30 August 2017, she  issued
    amended guidance: Fee waiver: Human Rights-Based  and  other  specified
    applications, version 2.0.  I need not dwell on that guidance.  It  was
    in force from that date until 4 January 2019.  The  parties  before  me
    are in agreement that it is upon the 2019 guidance that I should focus,
    notwithstanding the fact that the applications were made when version 2
    was in force.

Version 3.0 of the Fee Waiver Policy

46.  The  current  version   of   the   guidance   is   available   online:
    https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/applications-for-a-fee-
    waiver-and-refunds.  It is a lengthy document, running to 27  pages  of
    single-spaced type,  and  does  not  readily  lend  itself  to  precis,
    although it is plainly necessary  to  consider  its  structure  and  to
    highlight certain passages, as counsel did  in  the  detailed  skeleton
    arguments filed on both sides.


47. As is commonplace, the policy begins with a statement of purpose and  a
    section explaining the changes from the last version of  the  guidance.
    That section explains that  there  will  be  a  transition  to  digital
    applications from 4 January 2019 and that certain changes  to  the  fee
    waiver application process have been made  in  light  of  that  change.
    That section is irrelevant to the present  claim.   What  is  relevant,
    however, is the section entitled "Other changes from  last  version  of
    this guidance", which contains four paragraphs, the second of which  is
    as follows:

         The stages of the decision are now set out  in  order  to  make  it
         clear that the decision on the request for a fee waiver takes  into
         account whether the applicant can afford the amount required at the
         time of the application, and whether this is  consistent  with  the
         applicant's wider circumstances.

48. Pages 6-7 contain sections entitled "Applicants who are  eligible"  and
    "Circumstances to be considered".  The  former  section  states,  inter
    alia, that applicants who are eligible  for  a  fee  waiver  are  those
    making certain specified human rights applications  "where  to  require
    payment  of  the  fee  before  deciding  the   application   would   be
    incompatible with a person's rights under the ECHR".   It  also  states
    that the guidance has taken  account  of  the  judgments  in  Omar  and
    Carter.  The latter section  states  that  decision  makers  must  have
    regard to the best interests of children  in  assessing  a  fee  waiver
    application.  It also states that applicants will be asked  to  provide
    details of their financial circumstances, in the form  of  six  months'
    statements from all relevant bank accounts  and  a  full  breakdown  of
    incomings and outgoings.  Checks might be  undertaken  with  government
    agencies and  with  Equifax  to  verify  information  provided  by  the
    applicant with regard to their income and finances.


49. Pages 8-9 consider the types of immigration applications  for  which  a
    fee waiver may be requested, and need not be further considered in this
    judgment.  Nor do I need to consider the section which follows, dealing
    with the applications for which a fee waiver cannot be requested.

50. It is pages 13-24 of the guidance which are  particularly  relevant  to
    the challenge advanced by Mr Mackenzie.  Page 13  begins  by  reminding
    caseworkers that fee waivers are only available under certain specified
    routes, as defined previously.   It  then  states  that,  in  order  to
    receive a fee waiver, an applicant "must qualify on the basis of one of
    the three definitions  below".   The  three  definitions  appear  in  a
    different sized font, interspersed with other text, over the course  of
    the next three pages.  They are, verbatim, as follows:


          i) The applicant has demonstrated, by way of evidence, that  they
             are destitute.


         ii) The applicant has demonstrated, by way of evidence, that  they
             would be rendered destitute by payment of the fee.

        iii) Where the applicant provided evidence that, although  none  of
             the  destitution  criteria  apply,   there   are   exceptional
             circumstances in their case that justify the grant  of  a  fee
             waiver.

51. The structure of pages 13-14 is rather confusing, as Sir James Eadie QC
    was constrained to accept.  Whilst these three 'definitions' appear  to
    be sub-headings, the text  which  appears  underneath  the  third  sub-
    heading does not appear to relate to the question of whether there  are
    exceptional circumstances that justify the grant of a fee waiver.  With
    the exception of a hyperlink  to  a  different  part  of  the  guidance
    (entitled "Assessing whether there are exceptional circumstances"), the
    text underneath the third definition appears to relate  to  the  second
    definition.  Underneath the 'exceptional circumstances' subheading,  we
    also find two paragraphs which state, firstly, that  the  'decision  to
    grant a fee waiver will  rely  on  two  sets  of  considerations'  and,
    secondly, that:


         The first consideration is whether the  applicant  can  afford  the
         amount required at  the  time  of  application.  If  the  applicant
         cannot, then the second  consideration  is  whether  requiring  the
         amount would mean the applicant living in such a way as to lead  to
         destitution.


52. Page 16 is entitled 'Assessing and taking individual circumstances into
    account'.  Caseworkers are instructed to assess the application  for  a
    fee waiver on the basis of the information provided by the applicant in
    the relevant form and by the accompanying evidence.  At the top of page
    16, the guidance states that "The  assessment  itself  is  against  the
    circumstances of destitution, or its likelihood if required to pay  the
    fee, as set  out  in  the  qualifying  section  above."   Having  drawn
    attention to the requirement to provide satisfactory evidence,  and  to
    various circumstances which might be particularly  relevant  (including
    pregnancy and physical or mental disabilities),  the  guidance  reminds
    caseworkers that:

         The significance of considering such  individual  circumstances  is
         that they have the potential to impact on the applicant's resources
         and  therefore  the  consideration  of  whether  the  applicant  is
         destitute or would be rendered destitute by payment of the fee,  or
         whether there  are  exceptional  circumstances  relating  to  their
         financial circumstances and ability to pay the fee  such  that  the
         fee waiver should be granted.

53. Over the course of pages 17-20, there is guidance on specific subjects,
    including the consideration of requests from applicants who are part of
    a wider household, the  timeframe  for  considering  the  request,  the
    consideration of documentary evidence (highlighting again that the onus
    is on the applicant), applicants who are in  receipt  of  support  from
    NASS, a local authority or a registered charity, and  a  list  of  some
    other miscellaneous factors to be taken into account.  There  are  then
    sections  dealing  specifically  with  what  might  be   considered   a
    reasonable period to save from disposable income  and  the  intentional
    disposal of funds.  There is then a sub-heading of  'Assessing  whether
    there are exceptional circumstances'.  (This  is  the  section  of  the
    guidance to which the reader is directed by clicking on  the  hyperlink
    at page 14 of the guidance).    Below  the  sub-heading  there  is  the
    following (the emphasis is in the original):


         Although a fee waiver will not normally be granted  where  evidence
         of destitution is not provided, or where an applicant  cannot  show
         that they would be rendered destitute by paying the fee, there  may
         be exceptional circumstances affecting the applicant's  expenditure
         which mean  that  a  fee  waiver  should  be  granted.  Exceptional
         circumstances  at  this  point  relates  only  to  the  applicant's
         financial circumstances and their ability to  pay  the  application
         fee.


         For instance, if the applicant is not destitute and  would  not  be
         rendered destitute by paying the fee but cannot afford  to  pay  it
         because, in  relation  to  their  income,  they  incur  significant
         additional expenditure to provide for a child's  well-being  needs.
         This  does  not  mean  discretionary  items,  but  it   does   mean
         substantial items such as travel to special  needs  facilities,  or
         expenses linked to responding  to  illness,  or  long  term  health
         conditions  or  disability.  A  decision  on  whether   there   are
         exceptional circumstances should be made on a  case-by-case  basis,
         taking into account the applicant's  individual  circumstances  and
         those of any dependent family member and all  the  information  and
         evidence the applicant provides in  support  of  their  fee  waiver
         request.


         It is for the applicant to provide evidence that there is something
         exceptional about their financial circumstances and ability to  pay
         that warrant granting the fee waiver request, even though they  are
         not destitute or likely to be rendered destitute by payment. If  it
         is obvious that the applicant is dealing with exceptional financial
         circumstances along the lines described,  but  insufficient  detail
         has been provided, the  decision  maker  should  ask  for  detailed
         verification. If the decision maker considers a fee waiver  may  be
         appropriate  on  the  basis  of  exceptional   circumstances,   the
         application should  be  referred  to  a  senior  caseworker  for  a
         decision.

54. Pages 22-24 provide detailed guidance on the way in  which  income  and
    assets are to be considered, with  sub-headings  relating  income  from
    employment and self-employment, illegal working, welfare  benefits  and
    tax credits and support from family and friends.  I need not  refer  to
    the final pages, which refer to the process for  granting  or  refusing
    fee waiver requests.


Witness Evidence for the Respondent

55. On 3 February 2020, a witness statement was filed by the respondent  in
    support of her defence.  It was made by Mike Gallagher, who is a  Grade
    7 Policy Adviser  in  the  Asylum  and  Family  Policy  Unit.   He  has
    responsibility for the fee waiver  policy  insofar  as  it  applies  to
    applicants who rely on Article 8 ECHR.  He has been in that role  since
    28 January 2018.

56. Mr Gallagher gives background to the fee waiver policy at [4]-[8].   He
    states that the aim of the policy is to allow Article 8  rights  to  be
    formally considered and to avoid an applicant whose  Article  8  rights
    are engaged becoming unlawfully present in the UK where they are unable
    to pay the fee.  He notes that the IHS increased from �200 to �400  per
    year in January 2019 and that this necessitated a change in policy,  by
    requiring decision makers to consider the overall  amount  to  be  paid
    when a fee waiver request was made.   At  [7],  he  confirms  that  the
    guidance was drafted having regard to the decisions in Omar and Carter.
     At [8], he summarises what he understands to be the  effect  of  those
    cases.  The ratio of Carter is described as follows:

         In the Carter case the court found that our policy did not  go  far
         enough because whilst it offered  protection  to  those  that  were
         destitute or receiving NASS support, it did  not  cover  those  who
         could not afford the fee without becoming destitute.

57. At [9]-[14], Mr Gallagher considers the criteria for a fee waiver.   He
    states that the decision making process is  in  two  stages,  which  he
    describes as follows:


         The first consideration  is  whether  the  applicant  can  pay  the
         required  amount  at  this  point  in  time?   Secondly,  is   this
         consistent with the applicant's circumstances  as  demonstrated  by
         all the evidence provided.  The aim  of  this  is  to  ensure  that
         applicants are not required  to  pay  the  required  amount  simply
         because they can on the day, but with a future  detrimental  effect
         to them as a result.

58. He also states the guidance requires caseworkers to  check  whether  an
    applicant whose financial circumstances are  otherwise  'robust'  might
    have a reduced ability to pay the fee  at  the  required  time.   Taken
    together, he states at [13], the relevant statements  in  the  guidance
    'provide decision makers with scope to take  into  account  the  future
    impact on an applicant, and scope to  take  into  account  whether  the
    applicant is endeavouring to be able to afford the fee, as  opposed  to
    acting without regard to this'.


59. At [15]-[18],  Mr  Gallagher  highlights  what  is  apparent  from  the
    guidance already; that the onus is on the applicant to provide evidence
    in support of their application for a fee  waiver.   He  considers  the
    possibility of loans from those already providing support at  [18]  and
    at [19]-[20] he explains how further  evidence  might  be  sought  from
    those with  leave  to  remain  but  not  from  those  who  are  present
    unlawfully, who are expected to submit a  further  application  in  the
    event of a refusal to waive the fee.

60. At [21]-[24], Mr Gallagher comments on the application of the  guidance
    to the specific circumstances of the applicant's case, highlighting the
    fact (accepted by Mr Mackenzie) that the  applicants  did  not  provide
    evidence corroborating that they were receiving support from family and
    friends.  He notes that the absence of any such statement is 'fatal' to
    the request for a fee waiver: [24].

Submissions

61. I am grateful to counsel on both sides for the clarity and  economy  of
    their submissions, the essence of which was as follows.


62. For  the  applicants,  Mr  Mackenzie  prefaced  his  written  and  oral
    submissions with four points which were said, without  demur  from  the
    respondent, to represent common ground between the parties:


    (i)  The Applicants were liable (unless eligible for a fee  waiver)  to
         pay a  total  of  �7,665  for  their  applications  (including  the
         Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS), liability for which  stands  or
         falls with their liability to pay a fee).


    (ii)     Following Omar and Carter, the test to be applied when  a  fee
         waiver is sought is whether the applicant can afford to pay the fee
         (the "affordability test"). As it was put in Carter  at  [27],  the
         issue is whether the individual can 'get their hands on  the  [sums
         of money] necessary to pay the fee'.


    (iii)    A sub-set of the affordability test is  whether  an  applicant
         will be destitute (as defined in law) as a result of paying the fee
         (the "destitution test"); however, the destitution test is not  the
         ultimate question to be asked. That is to  say,  a  person  who  is
         destitute will be unable to afford the fee and thus entitled  to  a
         fee waiver, but the enquiry does not stop there, because  a  person
         who is not destitute may nonetheless be unable to 'get their hands'
         on the money for the fee.


    (iv)     The Applicants cannot  be  removed  without  consideration  of
         their human rights.

63. In his skeleton argument and his oral submissions, Mr  Mackenzie  posed
    four questions for the Tribunal to  consider.   I  take  the  questions
    posed and Mr Mackenzie's suggested answers to  those  question  largely
    from the helpful summary which appears at [3] of his skeleton.


64. Mr Mackenzie asks me to consider, firstly, whether the 2019 guidance is
    consistent with the decision in Omar and Carter.  He submits that it is
    not, primarily because it does not require the decision-maker to  apply
    the affordability test,  but  rather  to  ask  themselves  whether  the
    applicant will be  destitute  as  a  result  of  paying  the  fee  (the
    "destitution test").

65. Mr Mackenzie submits that the second question  for  me  to  resolve  is
    whether the respondent's decision  in  this  particular  case  actually
    applied the affordability test.  He submits  that  the  respondent  did
    not,  and  that  she  applied  the  destitution  test  'as  indeed  was
    inevitable on any reading of the 2019 guidance as a whole'.

66. The third question posed by the applicants is  said  to  arise  in  the
    event that I conclude that the  respondent  applied  the  affordability
    test.  If so, the question posed is whether the  respondent  reasonably
    concluded that the applicant had not shown that they could  not  afford
    the fee.  The applicants submit that it was not reasonably open to  the
    respondent, considering the evidence as a whole, to conclude that  they
    had, or were able to acquire, sufficient funds.

67. By the fourth and final question, Mr Mackenzie asks whether  it  is  an
    answer to the applicant's case to submit, as the respondent  does  with
    reference to Ahsan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 2009; [2018] Imm AR 531, they
    could have made (or could in the future make) a human rights  claim  by
    way of written submissions without a formal application  for  leave  to
    remain and the relevant fee.  Mr Mackenzie submits that it is not.   He
    submits that the respondent's stance on this issue was inconsistent  in
    inter partes correspondence  and  that  the  position  adopted  by  the
    respondent before the Tribunal is inconsistent with the  terms  of  the
    decision under challenge.  (Mr Mackenzie's submissions in  this  regard
    were in any event refined in order to respond to  the  additional  note
    which the respondent produced midway through the hearing, the  contents
    of which I reproduce below.)

68. For the respondent, Sir James Eadie QC and Mr  Malik  submit,  firstly,
    that the guidance  is  consistent  with  the  authorities,  which  were
    expressly  taken  into  account  in  its  formulation.   The   concerns
    addressed by Stewart J in Carter  are  fully  addressed  by  the  third
    iteration of the guidance, which makes it  clear  that  the  underlying
    question is whether the applicant is able to pay the fee.

69. The respondent submits in response to the second  and  third  questions
    posed by the applicants that the decision in question properly  applied
    the test in the authorities and that the respondent  reached  a  lawful
    decision in light of the absence of adequate evidence provided  by  the
    applicants.

70. The respondent submits, fourthly, that matters have moved on since Omar
    and Carter were decided.  The position adopted  by  the  respondent  in
    Ahsan, Shrestha [2018] EWCA Civ 2810 and  Balajigari  [2019]  EWCA  Civ
    673; [2019] 1  WLR  4647  was  relevant.   It  could  not  properly  be
    submitted that the decision to treat the applications  as  invalid  was
    incompatible with Article 8 ECHR because the applicants  would  not  be
    removed from the  UK  until  their  rights  under  the  ECHR  had  been
    considered.

71. I should also  record,  as  foreshadowed  above,  that  the  respondent
    produced an additional note after  the  short  adjournment.   This  was
    seemingly produced in answer to  concerns  expressed  by  Mr  Mackenzie
    about the application of the respondent's stance in Ahsan (etc) to  the
    applicants' case.  The note, which was handed up without objection from
    Mr Mackenzie, begins by  stating  the  terms  of  section  113  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  Act[2].   At  [2],  the
    respondent  states  that  in  order  to  fall  within  that   statutory
    definition, "a human rights claim does not require to be  made  in  the
    form of a fee paid application under the Immigration Rules".  Given its
    potential significance in other cases, I must reproduce the rest of the
    note verbatim:

         [3]  A  human  rights  claim  ought  to  be  made  by  a   fee-paid
         application, in the interests of orderly decision-making, and  that
         priority may be given  to  claims  so  made;  but  that  is  not  a
         statutory requirement and even if a claim is  made  in  some  other
         form an applicant will not be removed from the United Kingdom until
         it has been considered.


         [4] In this case, the applicant  has  not  made  a  valid  fee-paid
         application under the Immigration Rules.  However, the  application
         covering letter dated 22 December 2018 is a human rights claim that
         meets the section  113  definition.   The  applicant  will  not  be
         removed from the United Kingdom until it has been  considered.   It
         is not unlawful to consider it forthwith at this stage.


         [5] It is desirable in  the  interests  of  orderly  and  efficient
         decision-making for a human rights claim to be made by way of a fee
         paid application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  If the
         applicant makes such an application,  it  will  be  considered  and
         determined in accordance with the Immigration Rules;  and  priority
         may be given of [sic] that application.  If the applicant makes  no
         such application, she will not be removed from the  United  Kingdom
         unless the human rights claim  made  in  the  application  covering
         letter  dated  22  December  2018  is  considered   and   adversely
         determined.

72. Sir James Eadie QC accepted in oral argument that this note  omitted  a
    crucial word in the final sentence of [4], which was  plainly  intended
    to read "It is not unlawful  not  to  consider  it  forthwith  at  this
    stage."

73. This note prompted Mr Mackenzie to submit in  reply  that  his  clients
    were entitled to much of the relief  sought  in  the  claim  form.   In
    particular, he noted that the applicants had sought an  order  quashing
    the respondent's decision to treat their human rights claims as invalid
    and an order prohibiting the respondent from  removing  the  applicants
    from the UK until there had been a lawful assessment of their claims.

74. I reserved judgment at the conclusion of the  oral  argument.   Shortly
    before this judgment was to be sent to the  parties  in  its  embargoed
    form, additional written submissions were filed by the both parties  on
    9 April 2020.  In these notes, the advocates drew to my  attention  two
    decisions which had recently been handed down by Lane P: R (Mujahid)  v
    FtT & SSHD [2020] UKUT 85 (IAC) and MY (Pakistan) [2020] UKUT 89 (IAC).
     In both notes, the focus was on the latter of  these  decisions.   The
    respondent sought to submit that MY (Pakistan) supported  the  argument
    she advanced with reference to Ahsan.  The applicant submitted that the
    respondent had made an important and  far-reaching  concession  in  the
    short note handed up at the hearing and that the position considered in
    Lane P's decision must be taken to have been superseded as a result  of
    that concession.

75. It was as a result of these notes - and particularly that filed by  the
    applicant - that I requested a copy of any written arguments which were
    filed by the respondent in Shrestha [2018] EWCA Civ 2810.  The  written
    submissions settled by Mr Thomann of counsel were sent by email  on  17
    April 2020.

Discussion

76. This is not a case in which  there  is  any  disagreement  between  the
    parties regarding the correct approach to the interpretation of the Fee
    Waiver Guidance.  As Chamberlain J recently explained in  R  (Ellis)  v
    SSHD [2020] UKUT 82 (IAC), it is for the courts to interpret such extra-
    statutory policies, in accordance with the  objective  meaning  that  a
    reasonable and literate person would ascribe to them:  [29]-[37].   His
    conclusion in that regard accords with that of the Court of  Appeal  in
    MS & MBT v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1190; [2018] 1 WLR 389,  at  [37]-[42],
    per Underhill LJ, with whom Simon and Gloster LJJ  agreed.   Sir  James
    Eadie QC did not attempt to persuade me to adopt a different  approach,
    submitting that the guidance was either 'ex facie good'  or  'ex  facie
    bad' and that it was for the Tribunal to decide whether  it  accurately
    reflected the law.


77. Adopting that approach, I consider there to be fundamental difficulties
    with the Fee Waiver guidance.  The first is that it does not  expressly
    state what is accepted on both sides to be  the  underlying  test  from
    Omar and Carter, which is whether the applicant is able in  reality  to
    afford the fee (helpfully  labelled  "the  affordability  test"  by  Mr
    Mackenzie).  Counsel for the respondent accepted at the outset  of  his
    submissions that it was common ground that this was  the  yardstick  by
    which eligibility for a fee waiver is to be gauged.   Omar  and  Carter
    are mentioned in the policy, and Mr Gallagher indicates in his  witness
    statement that the intention was to tailor the guidance so as  to  take
    account of what was said by Beatson J and Stewart J.  Contrary  to  one
    of the submissions made at [20] of the respondent's skeleton  argument,
    however, the guidance does  not  make  clear  at  any  point  that  the
    "underlying question" is whether an applicant can afford the fee.

78. As accepted by Sir James Eadie QC in oral argument, there is no express
    statement at any point in the lengthy guidance  that  affordability  is
    the underlying question.  The nearest  the  guidance  gets  to  such  a
    statement is  the  reference  at  the  start  of  the  document  to  an
    applicant's ability to pay being taken into account (as  reproduced  at
    [47] above).  That  is  to  relegate  the  overarching  question  to  a
    material consideration.  I consider the absence of a clear statement of
    the underlying test to be an important omission;  the  provision  of  a
    detailed analytical framework is unlikely to assist a caseworker who is
    not squarely  directed  to  the  underlying  question  which  they  are
    required to consider.   Those tasked with applying  this  guidance  are
    not lawyers.  They are not expected  to  have  familiarised  themselves
    with the decisions from the Administrative Court.  In the absence of an
    express statement of the underlying test, there is every danger that it
    will not be understood.

79. I have already alluded to the respondent's  frank  acceptance  in  oral
    argument  that  the  structure  of  pages  13-14  of  the  guidance  is
    confusing.  As I observed in my attempt to summarise the terms  of  the
    policy, these important introductory sections, which  will  necessarily
    inform the reasonable  and  literate  reader's  understanding  of  what
    follows, fail to adopt any sort of logical structure.  The three  tests
    (which might conveniently be labelled 'currently destitute',  'rendered
    destitute' and 'exceptional circumstances') are  stated  but  the  text
    which appears under  the  sub-headings  does  not  consistently  relate
    logically to those tests.   As  counsel  for  the  respondent  accepted
    before  me,  the  text  which  appears  underneath   the   'exceptional
    circumstances' sub-heading on page 14 appears to relate entirely to the
    second question.  It is only if the reader chooses to ignore that  text
    and  to  click  on  the  "Assessing  whether  there   are   exceptional
    circumstances' hyperlink that they would be taken to  guidance  on  the
    third test.  The result is that the reasonable and literate  reader  of
    the policy is likely to be  confused  by  this  important  introductory
    section of the guidance.

80. Mr Mackenzie submitted orally and in  writing  that  the  guidance  was
    dominated by considerations of destitution, with the  result  that  the
    proper question - of whether an individual applicant could  afford  the
    fee - was obscured.  He noted in his oral submissions  that  the  words
    'destitute' or 'destitution' appear 40 times in the  guidance.   Whilst
    the precise number of times that those words appears is not significant
    in itself, the submission does reflect the  distance  in  the  guidance
    between the test which should be applied and that which caseworkers are
    instructed  to  apply.   There  is  no   express   statement   of   the
    affordability test but there is repeated  and  extensive  reference  to
    destitution.

81. Mr Mackenzie does not submit that there  is  no  utility  in  directing
    caseworkers to consider whether an individual is  currently  destitute,
    or whether they would become so if they paid the relevant fee.  Counsel
    on both sides accept that those categories form a sub-set of those  who
    simply cannot afford to pay the fee.  Assisting caseworkers to identify
    those who fall into these two categories is  therefore  of  some  value
    but, as Mr Mackenzie submits, the constant and  repeated  reference  to
    destitution serves to focus the attention of the reasonable  reader  of
    the policy on the subset rather than the wider question.

82. Even if these first two stages of the guidance adopt an improper  focus
    on destitution without stating the correct and wider test, the guidance
    poses a third question, as set out above.  The real issue, it seems  to
    me, is whether  the  guidance  as  a  whole  is  capable  of  assisting
    caseworkers to undertake a structured analysis which yields a  reasoned
    conclusion on the ultimate question of whether an individual can afford
    the application fee.   Those who fall into the first two  categories  -
    currently destitute or rendered destitute - must, on any sensible view,
    comprise only a small number of applicants.  As Mr  Mackenzie  submits,
    there are likely to be many applicants who maintain that they  are  not
    destitute nor at risk of becoming so upon payment of the  fee  but  who
    maintain that they just have no  way  of  accessing  the  thousands  of
    pounds necessary to make a paid application.  In those cases, it is  to
    the third stage of the guidance to which the caseworker will turn.

83. Before I turn to my own analysis of that third stage of  the  guidance,
    it is timely to recall the way in which the  guidance  summarises  this
    third stage.   At pages 13-14, it is expressed in  the  following  way:
    "Where the applicant provided  evidence  that,  although  none  of  the
    destitution criteria apply,  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  in
    their case that justify the grant of a fee waiver."  At  pages  17  and
    18, the test is differently formulated, in this way: "whether there are
    exceptional circumstances relating to their financial circumstances and
    ability to pay the fee such that the fee  waiver  should  be  granted".
    Then there is the dedicated section at page 21 of the guidance, which I
    have already reproduced in full at  [53]  above.   (Slightly  different
    formulations appear on the Fee Waiver application form,  as  reproduced
    at [7] and [9] above.)

84. Against the backdrop provided by Omar and Carter, the rationale  behind
    these formulations of the third stage is wholly unclear.  If it  is  to
    generate an answer which complies with  the  overarching  affordability
    test, the issue which a caseworker  must  at  this  stage  consider  is
    simply whether an individual who is not destitute and who will  not  be
    rendered destitute by payment of the fee is  nevertheless  demonstrably
    unable  to  pay  the  fee.   The  introduction   of   an   'exceptional
    circumstances' dimension to this third and final stage not only  serves
    to obscure that question; it also serves, in the mind of  the  literate
    and reasonable reader,  to  erect  a  threshold  which  should  not  be
    present.  Those who are demonstrably unable to pay the fee  should  not
    be required to do so; they need not be unable to do so because there is
    'something exceptional about their financial circumstances'.

85. I asked Sir James Eadie QC why it might have been  thought  appropriate
    to  include  reference  to  exceptional  circumstances  throughout  the
    policy. His response was blunt:  it  would  have  been  better  to  re-
    formulate the policy from scratch (after the decision  in  Carter)  but
    that this had not been done, and the present version  of  this  section
    carries over some of what was in the initial version of the policy.  It
    was to be seen, he submitted, as a "product of history".  The basis  of
    his answer is quite apparent when page  10  of  the  first  version  is
    compared with page 21 of the current version.

86. Counsel for the respondent submitted that the most significant question
    for me to resolve was whether this aspect of the guidance -  framed  as
    it is  with  reference  to  exceptional  circumstances  -  required  an
    applicant to demonstrate merely an inability to pay  or  whether  there
    was an elevated threshold.  He submitted that it was  clear,  when  the
    guidance  was  read  as  a  whole,  that  there  was  no  threshold  of
    exceptionality.  He drew attention to the  fact  that  caseworkers  are
    required by the guidance to take careful and  holistic  account  of  an
    individual's circumstances.  He noted the rubric next to the  third  of
    the boxes on page 4 of the fee  waiver  application  form:  "I  am  not
    destitute and would not become destitute if I paid the application fee,
    but  I  have  exceptional  circumstances  relating  to   my   financial
    circumstances which mean that I am unable to pay the fee." He submitted
    that the form and the guidance clearly showed  that  consideration  was
    given to an applicant's ability to pay, without any additional  element
    of exceptionality being required.  The guidance  did  not  confine  the
    circumstances in which an individual who was genuinely  unable  to  pay
    would be able to secure a fee waiver, he submitted.

87. However elegantly these submissions  were  advanced,  I  am  unable  to
    accept them.  It  is  obviously  correct  that  there  is  reference  -
    throughout the guidance and the application form - to  an  individual's
    ability to pay.  Wherever there is such a  reference,  however,  it  is
    accompanied by reference to  exceptional  circumstances.   The  example
    given in the section on page 21 - of a sickly  child  who  presents  an
    unusual drain on a family resources -  only  serves  to  reinforce  the
    impression that caseworkers are required to consider not  only  whether
    an individual can pay the fee, but also whether any inability to do  so
    is the product of exceptional circumstances.  I am reinforced  in  that
    conclusion by the occasions when the guidance refers to the test  being
    whether there are exceptional circumstances  without  reference  to  an
    inability to pay.  Notably, the sub-heading on page  21  is  'Assessing
    whether there are exceptional circumstances' and not 'Assessing whether
    those not covered by definitions (1)  and  (2)  might  nevertheless  be
    unable to afford the fee' or even 'Assessing whether the applicant  can
    afford the fee.'  A reasonable and literate person who sought to  apply
    this guidance would, in my judgment, consider  that  an  applicant  who
    failed  to  meet  the  first  two  tests  would  be  required  to  show
    exceptional financial circumstances, and that it would not suffice  for
    an applicant merely to establish by evidence that they were  unable  to
    pay.   Even  if  the  guidance  does  not   expressly   'confine'   the
    circumstances in which an applicant might qualify for a fee waiver,  it
    colours  the  required  analysis  with  its  consistent  reference   to
    exceptional circumstances.


88. The requirement for exceptional  circumstances  to  be  established  by
    those who are unable to meet  the  first  two  definitions  prompts  Mr
    Mackenzie to submit that the guidance gives rise to a significant 'gap'
    between those who should be eligible for fee waiver and those  who  are
    deemed to be so by the guidance.  The guidance gives the example of the
    family whose  resources  are  depleted  by  unusual  financial  demands
    brought about by a sick child.  Consider, however, the circumstances of
    the applicant family.  Their essential living  needs  are  met  by  the
    charity of others.  They are not destitute and there is no risk of them
    falling into destitution upon payment of the fee but they maintain that
    they simply  have  no  way  of  raising  the  several  thousand  pounds
    necessary to make an application to regularise their status.  There  is
    nothing 'exceptional' about their circumstances, which are very similar
    to a great number of applicants who manage to remain in the UK  without
    leave despite the  hostile  environment.   Were  their  account  to  be
    accepted, however, it could not properly be said that they are able  to
    afford the fee.

89. I come to the clear conclusion that the overall effect of the  guidance
    is to circumscribe unduly the  circumstances  in  which  an  individual
    might qualify for a fee waiver.  The underlying affordability  test  is
    not mentioned expressly.  The structure of pages 13 and 14 is  confused
    and confusing.  The guidance is dominated by references to destitution,
    which further obscures the relevant test.  The analysis required by the
    third stage impermissibly erects an 'exceptional circumstances' hurdle.
      A  reasonable  and  literate  person  applying  the  guidance   would
    understand the three stages to be focused upon destitution, the  threat
    of destitution and the  existence  of  exceptional  circumstances.   Mr
    Mackenzie submitted that the guidance was unlawful because there was  a
    real risk that the affordability test would not be applied.  He adopted
    that manner of expression from what was said by Hickinbottom LJ at [57]
    of PK (Ghana) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 98; [2018]  1  WLR  3955.   He  is
    certainly correct in that submission, although I prefer to  express  my
    conclusion more simply: the guidance is unlawful because  it  fails  to
    focus  the  mind  of  the  reasonable  and  literate  reader   on   the
    affordability test.  As in Carter, it does not provide for waiver  upon
    proper proof that the applicant cannot pay the fee; the reasonable  and
    literate reader would understand something more to be required.

90. It is  perfectly  understandable  that  the  respondent  should  expect
    foreign nationals who seek leave to remain  to  pay  a  fee  for  their
    application which represents in part a contribution to the departmental
    costs of processing an application and in part a payment in recognition
    of the benefits an applicant would obtain from a successful application
    (Odelola [2009] UKHL 25; [2009] 1 WLR 1230, at [10], refers).  As Sales
    J noted in Sheikh, resources must be diverted from other activities  of
    the State in the event that such costs  are  not  borne  by  applicants
    themselves.  The respondent  is  necessarily  entitled,  therefore,  to
    scrutinise applications for a fee waiver carefully,  so  as  to  ensure
    that those who are able to pay do  so.   What  the  respondent  is  not
    entitled to do, however, is to  obscure  the  underlying  affordability
    test and erect an exceptional circumstances threshold in place of  that
    test.

91.  Sir  James  Eadie  QC's  second  submission  in  defence  against   Mr
    Mackenzie's submissions was that the lawfulness of the guidance did not
    fall for consideration in this  case.   He  submitted  that  the  'gap'
    identified by Mr Mackenzie was not relevant on the facts of this  case;
    the reality of the decision in the applicants'  case  was  simply  that
    they had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to show  that  they  were
    unable to afford the fee.

92. I do not consider that submission to be correct,  essentially  for  the
    reasons given at [21]-[26] of Mr Mackenzie's  skeleton  argument.   The
    policy is unlawful for the reasons I have summarised at [88]. If  I  am
    to grant a declaration that the  guidance  is  unlawful,  the  ordinary
    course would be for the decision taken pursuant to that guidance to  be
    quashed.  As Mr Mackenzie submits, the decision taken by the respondent
    in these cases is in any event demonstrably tainted by the flaws in the
    guidance.  Like the guidance,  the  decision  itself  is  dominated  by
    consideration of whether the applicants  are  presently  destitute,  or
    would be rendered so by  payment  of  the  fee.   The  summary  of  the
    decision, as  reproduced  within  [19]  above  makes  no  reference  to
    affordability.  Paragraphs (1)-(4) assess whether the  applicants  were
    destitute, despite there having been no submission that  this  was  the
    case.  The second stage of the enquiry,  which  takes  place  over  the
    course of (5)-(10) of the decision, begins and ends with  reference  to
    whether the applicants would be rendered destitute by  payment  of  the
    fee.  The consideration of whether there are exceptional  circumstances
    is brief and formulaic.


93. It is submitted by the respondent that the ultimate conclusion  reached
    by her was simply that the evidence did not show  that  the  applicants
    were unable to pay the fee.  They  had  been  reminded  throughout  the
    application form, the respondent submits, that the onus was on them  to
    support their application for a fee waiver with adequate  evidence  and
    they had failed to do so.  That is not my reading of the decision. As I
    understand it, the respondent concluded that she was 'unable to assess'
    whether the applicants were able to pay the fee  because  she  had  not
    been provided with 'annotated' bank statements explaining  the  sources
    of funds which appeared in the accounts held by the  adult  applicants.
    As submitted by Mr Mackenzie, however, the  respondent  seems  to  have
    seized on the absence of specific evidence and  thrown  up  her  hands,
    rather than seeking to engage with the  import  of  the  evidence  with
    which she was presented.  It is notable in  that  connection  that  the
    respondent  stated  that  she  was  'unable  to  assess'  whether   the
    applicants were able to pay the fee, and that Mr  Gallagher  refers  to
    the absence of evidence being 'fatal'.

94. It is worth recalling the context in which the  evidence  presented  by
    the applicants fell to be considered.  The  adult  applicants  are  not
    permitted to work and have not been entitled to do so for more  than  a
    decade.  They submitted evidence to show that they have no  savings  to
    speak of and  the  respondent,  who  has  the  facility  to  check  for
    undisclosed bank accounts using the power conferred by s40  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007, did not cast doubt  on  that  evidence.   RAMFEL  had
    explained in their covering letter that their  services  were  provided
    pro bono publico and that the applicants were dependent upon  the  food
    bank run by that organisation.  The income  which  the  applicants  had
    received between March and November 2018 totalled �3660.  Even  if  all
    of that evidence had been saved for the payment of the  fee  (which  it
    had not been), the applicants would not have saved half of  the  amount
    necessary.  The evidence which had been presented  was  sufficient,  on
    any rational view, to establish that the applicants were unable to  pay
    a combined application fee of nearly �8000 from their own resources.

95. The possibility of applicants borrowing  money  in  order  to  fund  an
    application is addressed in the guidance, just as it  featured  in  the
    respondent's decision.  For those with leave to remain and a source  of
    income, it might presumably be expected that the fee for an application
    could be raised by way of a bank loan or other  credit  facility.   For
    those in the position of these applicants, however,  there  can  be  no
    suggestion that a bank or building society would be willing  to  extend
    credit in the sum required.  It is for that reason  that  the  guidance
    requires applicants in this position to establish by evidence that they
    are unable to secure a loan from one or more individuals.  The briefest
    consideration of that requirement reveals how it would, in practice, be
    practically impossible  to  prove.   Since  the  sources  of  potential
    charity are infinite, so too are the  potential  sources  of  evidence.
    The applicants seem to have received support from a Mr Abebrese  and  a
    Mr Acheampong during the period  under  consideration.  The  respondent
    considered it unacceptable  that  there  was  no  evidence  from  these
    individuals to show that they could not loan  the  applicants  the  sum
    needed to make the application.  Had letters and bank  statements  from
    these individuals been presented, however, the respondent might  simply
    have stated that the adult applicants - who have  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for many years - should be able to borrow the  sum  from  other
    acquaintances.  The difficulty in proving this particular  negative  is
    writ large.


96. As Mr Mackenzie submits at [31] of his skeleton argument, though,  this
    aspect of the guidance, and of the decision under challenge, has an air
    of fiction about it.  There is no reason to think that  individuals  in
    the position of these applicants - surviving on the charity  of  others
    and food from a local organisation - might have access to one  or  more
    Dickensian benefactors who would be able and willing to provide a  loan
    of nearly �8000, which might never be repaid.

97. In summary, therefore, I answer each of the first three questions posed
    by Mr Mackenzie  in  the  applicant's  favour.   The  guidance  is  not
    consistent with the affordability test  which  emerges  from  Omar  and
    Carter and which is agreed to be the  correct  test.  The  respondent's
    decision in this case followed the guidance in  failing  to  apply  the
    affordability test.  Even if the affordability test was applied, it was
    not rationally applied to the facts of the applicants'  case.   Subject
    to my consideration of the fourth question, or the 'Ahsan question', as
    it came to be described in submissions, the applicants are entitled  to
    the relief sought.

98. The respondent's submission in relation to the line of authority  which
    began with Ahsan [2017] EWCA Civ 2009; [2018] HRLR 5 has been something
    of a moving target.  From the date of decision until the  date  of  the
    hearing, the applicants understood the respondent to maintain that they
    had made no valid application for leave to remain and no  human  rights
    claim.  On the day of the hearing before me, the  latter  half  of  the
    respondent's position was either clarified (as I think  the  respondent
    would submit) or amended (as Mr Mackenzie did submit).

99. The respondent's Summary Grounds of Defence cited what had been said by
    leading counsel for the Secretary of State at [14] of Ahsan and set out
    various  passages  from  Shrestha  and  Balajigari  before  making  the
    following submission:

         [36] It is surely desirable for a human rights claim to be made  by
         way of a formal application for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom.  The Secretary  of  State  shall  give  priority  to  such
         applications, and  that  would  be  in  the  interests  of  orderly
         decision-making.  However, as recognised in recent  case-law,  this
         is not a requirement prescribed by the statute.  If a person  makes
         a claim by way of written submissions, without a formal application
         for leave to remain and the fee, that person would not  be  removed
         from the United Kingdom  until  that  claim  has  been  considered.
         There would, however, be no guarantee for a decision to be taken on
         such a claim within a specified time limit.


         [37] Accordingly, the premise on which Omar and Carter were decided
         (namely, it is, in all circumstances, mandatory for  a  person  who
         seeks to make an Article 8 claim to make a formal/paid  application
         on a specified application form) no longer exists.  In the light of
         the protection recognised by the Secretary of State and  the  Court
         of Appeal in Ahsan, Sherstha [sic] and Balajigari, it can no longer
         be said that a [sic] guidance which restricts the circumstances  in
         which fee waiver should  be  granted  would  be  incompatible  with
         Article 8.  Article 8 rights are protected, in  any  event,  for  a
         distinct reason.

100. It is to be noted that this position was  expressed  in  the  abstract;
    there was no positive acceptance on the part of the respondent that the
    applicants had actually  made  a  human  rights  claim  which  had  the
    protective effect suggested.  This stance prompted correspondence  from
    the applicants' solicitors to  the  GLD.   On  5  July  2019,  the  GLD
    responded to that correspondence in a short letter which  included  the
    following:


         It is denied that the  Respondent's  position  is  misleading.   It
         appears that you have misunderstood my client's response  and  have
         conflated a human rights (HR) application with a HR  claim.   These
         are two separate things.  To clarify, a formal  application  for  a
         grant of leave is made in conformity with the requirements  of  the
         immigration rules (either on the form  accompanied  by  a  relevant
         fee, or under an exception in Appendix FM).


         On the contrary, a  HR  claim  is  a  claim  that  removal  of  the
         applicant from the United Kingdom would be unlawful under section 6
         of the Human Rights Act 1998 (public authority not to act  contrary
         to  Human  Rights  Convention).   (Please  see  s113   Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002).  As a  result,  the  Respondent's
         position is that they do not have to determine  such  claims  until
         the issue of removal comes up.  The Court of Appeal  accepted  this
         distinction in the case of Ahsan & Others v SSHD 2017 EWCA Civ 2009
         (specifically  para  15),   copy   attached.    In   essence,   the
         Respondent's position is that every HR application is  a  HR  claim
         but not every HR claim is a HR application.

101. In an addendum to the summary grounds which was filed in  August  2019,
    in response to the applicants' amended grounds, the correctness of [36]
    of the original summary grounds was affirmed  by  the  respondent.  The
    stance adopted in the original summary grounds was also adopted at [25]
    and [26] of the Detailed Grounds of Defence and at [26] and [27] of the
    respondent's skeleton argument before me.  At  each  of  these  stages,
    therefore, there was no express acceptance that  these  applicants  had
    made a human rights claim which operated to prevent their removal  from
    the United Kingdom prior to its consideration.


102. In the note which was handed up during the hearing by Sir  James  Eadie
    QC,  the  entirety  of  which  I  have  already  set  out  above,   the
    respondent's stance was amended.  Even if a human rights claim had been
    made in some form other than that prescribed by the Immigration  Rules,
    the maker would not be  removed  until  it  had  been  considered,  she
    submitted.  As for the applicants, it was  expressly  accepted  by  the
    respondent that the covering letter from  RAMFEL  constituted  a  human
    rights claim and the applicants would not be removed until  that  claim
    had been considered.     It was on the basis of this note that  counsel
    for the respondent advanced his submission in  the  alternative,  which
    might be summarised as follows.  Even if the guidance  fails  to  adopt
    the  affordability  test  in  the  authorities,  the  human  rights  of
    applicants such as  this  family  are  nevertheless  protected  by  the
    acceptance that they have made a  human  rights  claim  which  must  be
    considered prior to removal.  Before  I  evaluate  that  submission,  I
    should first set out a little more of the relevant authorities.


103. Ahsan & Ors was part of the extensive litigation  which  arose  out  of
    the BBC's Panorama investigation into the use of proxies (or  'pilots')
    in a great number of TOEIC English language tests.  The question before
    the Court of Appeal, as summarised by Underhill LJ at [3], was  whether
    the applicants could  challenge  the  Secretary  of  State's  decisions
    (whether by judicial review or appeal) from within the  UK  or  whether
    they could only do so by an appeal brought  after  they  had  left  the
    country.   Two  of  the  appellants   had   been   given   notices   of
    administrative removal under s10 of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    1999, which attracted only an out of country  appeal.   The  other  two
    appellants had made (valid) applications for leave to remain  on  human
    rights  grounds.   Those  applications  had  been   refused   but   the
    certification of the decisions by the respondent meant that only an out
    of country appeal was permitted by  statute.   At  [14],  Underhill  LJ
    recorded one of the submissions made by counsel for  the  Secretary  of
    State in the following way:


         ... Ms Giovannetti accepted before us that in order to fall  within
         the terms of section 113 a "claim" does not require to be  made  in
         the form of a fee-paid application  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
         She made it clear  that  it  is  still  the  Secretary  of  State's
         position that a human rights claim ought to be  made  by  a  formal
         application, in the interests of orderly decision-making, and  that
         priority may be given to claims so made; but she acknowledged  that
         that was not a statutory requirement and she said that  even  if  a
         claim was made in some other form a claimant would not  be  removed
         from the UK until it had been considered.

104. It was pursuant to that stance that the respondent  expressly  accepted
    in both of the 'section 10 cases' that  the  appellants  had  raised  a
    human rights claim which engaged s113 even though  they  had  not  made
    human rights applications as separately defined: [106]-[107] refers.


105. The next case was Shrestha [2018] EWCA Civ 2810.  Although this  was  a
    decision on an application for permission to  appeal,  Hickinbottom  LJ
    (with whom Hamblen LJ, as he then  was,  agreed)  considered  that  the
    decision raised an  issue  of  wider  importance  and  that  it  should
    accordingly  receive  a  neutral  citation:  [37]  refers.    At   [1],
    Hickinbottom LJ summarised the issue in the case as follows:


         This application raises the following issue: if  an  applicant  for
         leave to remain raises a human rights ground  for  the  first  time
         after the refusal of  his  application  on  other  grounds  and  in
         response to a request by the Secretary of State under  section  120
         of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002
         Act"), does the Secretary of State have an obligation to treat  and
         determine that response as an application for leave  to  remain  on
         human rights grounds even absent any further form  of  application?
         The Applicants submit that he does. The Secretary of  State  denies
         any such obligation.

106. Having set out in full what was said at [14] of Ahsan, Hickinbottom  LJ
    described the position of the Secretary of State to be as follows:


         [33] In this case, Mr Thomann accepts that the Secretary  of  State
         cannot remove the Applicant without considering his claim  that  to
         do so would breach article 8 of the ECHR. But, as he  submits,  the
         use of removal powers is a last  resort.  On  the  basis  that  the
         Applicant needs leave to remain and does not have it, he  would  be
         expected to leave the United Kingdom voluntarily. It is, of course,
         open to him to make an application for leave  to  remain  on  human
         rights grounds, in the required form and on payment of the required
         fee. If he considers that he has such a claim, that is  the  course
         required  by  the  statutory  scheme.  If,  in  the  meantime,  the
         Secretary of State issues removal directions, then, at that  stage,
         the Applicant will be able to rely on any human rights  claim  that
         he and/or his daughter have; and, reflecting the passage from Ahsan
         which I have quoted, subject to certification, he will be  entitled
         to a right of appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  assess  the
         merits of that claim whether or not a formal  claim  for  leave  to
         remain has been made because, otherwise, his removal  would  breach
         article  8.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  will  suffer  no  possible
         unfairness or injustice as a  result  of  the  Secretary  of  State
         refusing to consider his human rights claim at this stage.

107. The answer given by Hickinbottom LJ to the question  he  had  posed  at
    the start of his judgment is to be found at [35]:


         For those reasons, I would answer  the  question  I  posed  at  the
         beginning of this judgment, "No": if  an  applicant  for  leave  to
         remain raises a human rights ground for the first  time  after  the
         refusal of his application on other grounds and in  response  to  a
         request by the Secretary of State under section  120  of  the  2002
         Act, the  Secretary  of  State  has  no  obligation  to  treat  and
         determine that response as an application for leave  to  remain  on
         human rights grounds  in  the  absence  of  the  required  form  of
         application and payment. Indeed, I do not consider the contrary  to
         be arguable.


108. Balajigari & Ors [2019] EWCA Civ 673; [2019] 1 WLR 4647 is the  leading
    decision on what have become known as 'earnings discrepancy cases',  in
    which  the  earnings  relied  upon  by  an  applicant  in  a   previous
    application for leave to remain conflict with those declared  to  HMRC.
    The discrepancies caused the Secretary  of  State,  in  each  case,  to
    refuse the applications for Indefinite Leave to  Remain  ("ILR")  which
    had been made by the appellants.  At [96], Underhill LJ  explained  why
    it had been necessary to bring claims for judicial review:  'a  refusal
    of ILR is not in itself an appealable  decision  under  s82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002'.  Underhill LJ went on to
    note that the refusal  of  a  human  rights  claim  was  an  appealable
    decision under the statutory scheme.  Having cited  s113  of  the  2002
    Act, he went on to state as follows, at p4676:


         The procedural requirements for making such a claim  were  recently
         reviewed by this Court in R (Shrestha) v Secretary of State for the
         Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 2810. In short, section 50  of  the
         Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 enables the  Secretary
         of  State  to  require  a  particular  procedure  to  be  followed,
         including the form to be used and the fee to be paid; and paragraph
         34 of the Immigration Rules, made under that  provision,  sets  out
         mandatory requirements for  an  application  for  leave  to  remain
         (which includes an application made on human rights grounds). Where
         an application fails to comply with those  requirements  (including
         by not referring to a claim for leave on human  rights  grounds  at
         all), there is no "human rights claim" refusal of which would  give
         rise to a right of appeal. The Secretary  of  State  has,  however,
         conceded that in the context of an imminent removal an appeal  will
         lie to the FTT against a refusal of a human rights  claim  even  if
         not made in proper form:  see  paras.  31-33  of  the  judgment  of
         Hickinbottom LJ in Shrestha. The basis  of  the  concession  (which
         originated in Ahsan: see para. 14 of the judgment of Underhill  LJ)
         is not articulated, but it would appear  to  be  justified  on  the
         basis that the Secretary of State can waive the formal requirements
         in the Rules.

109. As counsel noted in their helpful  post-hearing  notes,  this  line  of
    authority was comprehensively reviewed in two recent decisions  written
    by the President, Lane J: R (Mujahid) v FtT & SSHD [2020] UKUT 85 (IAC)
    and MY (Pakistan) [2020] UKUT 89 (IAC).  Like the parties, I propose to
    focus on only the latter decision.


110. The appellant in MY (Pakistan) had made an application for ILR  on  the
    basis of domestic violence.  The respondent did  not  accept  that  his
    marriage had broken down as a result of such violence.  She refused ILR
    accordingly, and stated that there was no right of appeal  against  the
    decision because it did not constitute the refusal of  a  human  rights
    claim.  She expressly declined to consider the human rights claim.  The
    appellant nevertheless sought to appeal.  The FtT declined jurisdiction
    for the reasons given by the respondent.  The appellant appealed to the
    Upper Tribunal, contending (partly in reliance on the decision of  Kerr
    J in R (AT) v SSHD [2017] EWHC 2589 (Admin); [2018] Imm  AR  483)  that
    the respondent's decision amounted to the refusal  of  a  human  rights
    claim and that a right of appeal accordingly arose under Part 5 of  the
    2002 Act.


111. Lane J reviewed his own decision in  Baihinga  [2018]  UKUT  90  (IAC);
    [2018] Imm AR 930 and that of Stephen Morris QC (sitting  as  a  Deputy
    Judge of the High Court, as he then was)  in  R  (Alighanbari)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWHC 1818 (Admin), noting that it was accepted by the respondent
    that the appellant had made  a  human  rights  claim:  [50]-[55].   For
    reasons  he  gave  at  [56]-[80]  the  President  concluded  that   the
    appellant's human rights submissions had not been refused because  they
    had not been considered, and therefore that there had been  no  refusal
    of a human rights claim which engaged s82  of  the  2002  Act.   In  so
    concluding, Lane J said this at [67]:


         The respondent's ability, pursuant to section 50 of the  2006  Act,
         to require a specified  procedure  to  be  followed  in  making  or
         pursuing an application or claim, and, in particular, in  requiring
         the use of a specified form (along with the payment of a  fee)  has
         been endorsed by the Court of Appeal  in  Shrestha.  Although  that
         case was concerned with a section 120 Notice, paragraphs  29-33  of
         the judgment of Hickinbottom  LJ  acknowledged  the  power  of  the
         respondent to regulate the way in  which  applications  and  claims
         fall for consideration under the Immigration Acts. The way in which
         the respondent does so may, of course, be  subject  to  public  law
         challenge. However, there is no suggestion  in  Shrestha  that  the
         Court had difficulties with the respondent's stance (which differed
         from that in Ahsan), whereby the  respondent  will,  as  a  general
         matter, engage with an application or claim only  if  made  in  the
         specified manner, until the point at which the individual concerned
         is subject  to  removal  directions,  when  no  formality  will  be
         necessary. We reject Ms Mair's  attempt  to  distinguish  Shrestha;
         although concerned with section 120, it contains an endorsement  of
         the respondent's practice that has relevance to the present case.

112.  The  judicial  headnote  to  the  decision  reflects  the  conclusions
    summarised at [81].  The headnote is as follows:


         (1) The Secretary of State's assessment of whether  a  claim  by  C
         constitutes a human rights claim, as defined by section 113 of  the
         Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  is  not  legally
         determinative. The  Secretary  of  State's  Guidance  is,  however,
         broadly compatible with what the High Court in  R  (Alighanbari)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1818 (Admin)
         has found to be the minimum elements of a human rights claim.


         (2) The fact that C has made a human rights  claim  does  not  mean
         that any reaction to it by the Secretary of State, which is not  an
         acceptance of C's claim, acknowledged by the grant of leave, is  to
         be treated as the refusal of a human  rights  claim  under  section
         82(1)(b) of the 2002 Act, generating a right of appeal to the First-
         tier Tribunal. The Secretary of State is legally entitled to  adopt
         the position that she may require human rights claims to be made in
         a particular way, if they are to be substantively considered by her
         so that, if refused, there will be a right of appeal.


         (3) There is, accordingly, no justification for construing  section
         82(1)(b) otherwise than according to its ordinary meaning, which is
         that the Secretary of State decides to refuse a human rights  claim
         if she:


         (i) engages with the claim; and
         (ii) reaches a decision that neither C nor anyone else who  may  be
         affected has a human right which is of such a kind as to entitle  C
         to remain in the United Kingdom (or to be given  entry  to  it)  by
         reason of that right.

113. With that overview of the authorities, I return to the submission  made
    by Sir James Eadie QC before me.  For the reasons which  follow,  I  do
    not consider the respondent's acceptance that the applicants have  made
    a human rights claim which will not be considered forthwith but at some
    point prior  to  removal  serves  to  affect  the  relief  which  would
    ordinarily flow from the conclusions I have reached in relation to  the
    guidance itself and the decision in the applicant's individual cases.


114. I do not accept the respondent's principal submission that  the  stance
    recorded and adopted in the  authorities  I  have  set  out  above  has
    removed the basis upon which Omar and  Carter  were  decided.   On  the
    contrary, I consider Mr Mackenzie to be correct in his submission  that
    the respondent's  argument  before  me  is  merely  a  reworking  of  a
    submission which was rejected by Beatson J in Omar.

115. At  [70]  of  his  judgment  in  Omar,  Beatson  J  recorded  that  the
    respondent's primary submission before him was that "the prospect of  a
    breach of Article 8 is only theoretical because the Secretary of  State
    has a residual power to grant leave to remain of  her  own  motion  and
    because of the other ways a claimant can obtain leave without making an
    application".  At [74], Mr Johnson QC for the Secretary  of  State  was
    recorded as having submitted, inter alia, that the claimant was able to
    bring his circumstances to the attention of the Secretary of  State  by
    submitting that he could  not  be  removed  without  disproportionately
    interfering  with  his  Convention  rights,  so  he  had  to  be  given
    discretionary leave without making a formal application'.

116. Those submissions were rejected by Beatson J for a number  of  reasons,
    not all of  which  I  propose  to  rehearse.   Amongst  those  reasons,
    however, was the following.  At [72], Beatson J concluded that  it  was
    'deeply unattractive' to submit that the Secretary of State could grant
    leave of her own motion, not least because it  required  an  individual
    who waited for her to do so to commit an offence under  section  24  of
    the Immigration Act 1971, although he  recognised  that  a  prosecution
    would be unlikely.  He also noted  that  requiring  a  person  in  that
    claimant's position to wait for the respondent to take a decision would
    confine them to what he described as a 'half-world' or 'limbo'[3].

117. Albeit in a slightly different guise, therefore,  the  submission  made
    by Sir James Eadie QC before me  was  made  before,  and  rejected  by,
    Beatson J.   Contrary to the submission made by the Secretary of  State
    in these proceedings, Beatson J did not proceed on the  basis  that  it
    was, in all circumstances, mandatory for a person who seeks to make  an
    Article 8 claim to  make  a  formal/paid  application  on  a  specified
    application form.  Beatson J acknowledged that there were other ways in
    which an individual might ventilate his Convention  rights  before  the
    Secretary of State but  he  did  not  accept  that  those  alternatives
    provided an adequate solution for the impecunious applicant who  sought
    to regularise their status.

118. As matters presently stand, the concerns expressed by Beatson  J  about
    individuals in the position of these applicants  being  confined  to  a
    half-world  apply  a  fortiori.   The  applicants  have  attempted   to
    regularise their position in the United Kingdom by attempting  to  make
    an application  for  leave  to  remain.   The  respondent  declined  to
    consider that application for  leave  to  remain  because,  as  I  have
    concluded, she operates an unlawful policy on fee waivers which is  not
    properly aligned with the affordability test.  As  a  result  of  those
    unlawful actions, the applicants are required to await a decision  from
    the Secretary of State on what she nevertheless accepts to have been  a
    valid human rights claim.  In the intervening period, they continue  to
    be subject to the hostile or compliant environment, the extent of which
    is clear from the decision under challenge (as set out at  [20]  above)
    and was recently considered by Hickinbottom LJ at [3] of  SSHD  v  JCWI
    [2020] EWCA Civ 542.  The 'battery of  provisions'  described  in  that
    judgment were largely brought about by the Immigration Act 2014.   What
    Beatson J considered to be a  'half-world'  is  now  even  less  of  an
    existence, and it is a position to which these  applicants  (adult  and
    child alike) are confined  by  the  unlawfulness  of  the  respondent's
    actions.


119. I consider it to be at this  point  that  Mr  Mackenzie's  reliance  on
    section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  bites.
    It is difficult to see how that the respondent  can  be  said  to  have
    regard to her statutory obligation to safeguard and promote the welfare
    of  children  when  children  such  as  the  third,  fourth  and  fifth
    applicants are confined to the hostile environment as a result  of  the
    respondent's adoption and application of  a  fee  waiver  policy  which
    fails to  reflect  the  affordability  test  properly  or  at  all.   I
    recognise, as did Mr Mackenzie, that the children have existed in  that
    environment for some years, as a result of the  decision  made  by  the
    first and second applicants to overstay and found a  family  whilst  in
    the UK unlawfully.  But their parents subsequently made an  application
    to  regularise  their  position  in  the  UK  and  were   entitled   to
    consideration of that  application  at  public  expense  if  they  were
    genuinely unable to afford the requisite fee.  It is the erection of an
    improper obstacle to that consideration, in the  form  of  an  unlawful
    policy, which means that the children are not entitled to consideration
    of  their  applications  'forthwith'  and   must   instead   wait   for
    consideration of their human rights claims in the fulness of time.

120. I am, in any event, concerned by the efficacy of the safety net  relied
    upon by the Secretary  of  State.   If  it  is  to  be  submitted  that
    individuals who have not made an effective  application  for  leave  to
    remain on human rights grounds are protected from removal because  they
    have nevertheless made a human rights claim, that protection  must  not
    be arbitrary or elusive.  It is necessary to recall the point  in  time
    at which it was made clear to these applicants that they were  accepted
    to have made a human rights claim  which  safeguarded  their  position.
    That was not said in the decision under challenge.  In fact, they  were
    given precisely the opposite indication, with the decision stating that
    they were liable to be  removed  from  the  UK.   They  were  not  told
    expressly in the response to their Letter Before Action that they  were
    accepted to have made a human rights claim.   Nor  did  the  respondent
    make that clear in the further correspondence to which I  have  alluded
    above.  Whilst the claim was afoot, the respondent did not state in the
    summary grounds, the detailed grounds, or even in the skeleton argument
    prepared for the hearing, that the applicants  were  accepted  to  have
    made a human rights claim.  That acceptance came orally and in  writing
    after lunch on the day of the hearing.

121. This seems to be a feature shared with the reported  decisions  I  have
    considered above.  It was seemingly only in the  course  of  litigation
    before the Court of Appeal in Ahsan and Shrestha  that  the  respondent
    accepted in terms that the applicants in those  cases  had  made  human
    rights claims which engaged s113 of the 2002 Act.

122. Consider, therefore, the position of the  individual  and  their  legal
    advisers upon receipt  of  a  notice  such  as  that  received  by  the
    applicants in this case.  The notice states that  the  application  for
    leave to remain  has  been  treated  as  invalid  because  it  was  not
    accompanied by the  requisite  fee.   It  states,  in  bold,  that  the
    individual is liable to be removed from the United Kingdom.   It  gives
    no indication whatsoever that a  human  rights  claim  is  nevertheless
    accepted to have been made.  Against the backdrop  of  the  authorities
    above, what advice might legitimately be given to the claimant, who  is
    naturally concerned that they might  be  removed  imminently  from  the
    United Kingdom?  Are they to be reassured that there was nevertheless a
    human rights claim  and  that  they  cannot  be  removed  until  it  is
    considered?  A right-thinking client may find that advice difficult  to
    accept, given the contents of the respondent's letter.  Or are they  to
    be advised,  contrary  to  what  might  actually  be  the  respondent's
    underlying position, that there was no valid application for  leave  to
    remain and no human rights claim, such that they are at  imminent  risk
    of removal action being taken?


123. Individuals such as the applicants  find  themselves  in  an  uncertain
    situation  upon  receipt  of  a  notice  such  as  the  decision  under
    challenge.  They have received no chit reassuring them that their human
    rights claim will be considered and that their position in  the  UK  is
    protected until then.  They cannot know with  any  degree  of  accuracy
    whether they are accepted by the respondent to have made a human rights
    claim or not. Externally, therefore, there is a lack of clarity in  the
    respondent's position.  I am also concerned that there  is  a  lack  of
    clarity internally, within the department itself.  It is wholly unclear
    to me why it was that the respondent only accepted at the eleventh hour
    that a human rights claim had  been  made  in  this  case.   Nor  do  I
    understand the point at which the respondent recognised that there  had
    been a human rights  claim.   Has  that  always  been  the  (previously
    undisclosed) position, or was it only accepted to be  the  position  at
    some point on the day of the  hearing?  If  this  claim  had  not  been
    underway, could the applicants have been removed without  consideration
    of the human rights claim which is now accepted to have been made?   It
    is not possible to say, and the lack of clarity in these  regards  must
    call into question the extent of the  protection  relied  upon  by  the
    respondent.  I note that Mr Gallagher's statement is  silent  on  these
    important questions.

124.  That  leads  me  to  a  further  point,  which  concerns  departmental
    recording of applications for leave to remain and human rights  claims.
    The respondent obviously has a record in this case that the  applicants
    attempted to make an application for leave  to  remain,  and  that  the
    application was rejected as invalid because it was not  accompanied  by
    the requisite fee.  The notice states, as I have noted more  than  once
    already, that the applicants are liable to be removed from  the  United
    Kingdom.  If the position is actually that they are not  liable  to  be
    removed from the United Kingdom because it is accepted that  they  have
    made a human rights claim, it is not clear to me how this is  reflected
    internally.  I asked Sir James Eadie QC how individuals such  as  these
    applicants (who have not made a valid application for leave  to  remain
    but have made a human rights claim) are identifiable  to  a  subsequent
    caseworker, who might come to consider the cases,  pre-removal,  months
    or years hence.  There might be no external acceptance, communicated to
    the applicant, that there is a 'barrier to removal'  but  is  there,  I
    enquired, some internal system by which this is clearly identified?  He
    was unable to give any  indication  of  the  mechanism  by  which  this
    identification might take place.

125. It would be all too easy, in my judgment, to dismiss these concerns  by
    stating that there is a record, not only in the respondent's  note  but
    also in this judgment and in the files of the  applicant's  solicitors,
    to show that the respondent has accepted  that  these  applicants  have
    made a human rights claim and that they cannot be removed until it  has
    been considered.  In this case, that is undoubtedly correct.  Were  the
    respondent to seek to remove these applicants without  considering  the
    claim which is accepted to have been made, their representatives  would
    surely take action to prevent that course.  But there will be many such
    cases in  which  potentially  vulnerable  applicants  are  not  legally
    represented and it cannot simply be assumed,  in  the  absence  of  any
    indication about the mechanism for identifying  such  cases,  that  the
    human rights of individuals in this position  will  be  safeguarded  by
    their having made a human rights claim at some point previously.

126. In summary, therefore, I do not accept that  the  submissions  made  by
    the respondent in reliance on Ahsan and subsequent authorities provides
    any answer to the submissions made by Mr Mackenzie regarding the policy
    or the decision in this case.   That line of authority (or the position
    adopted by the respondent within it) has not  removed  the  basis  upon
    which Omar and Carter were decided.   If,  as  I  have  concluded,  the
    respondent's policy on fee waiver is  unlawful,  it  is  no  answer  to
    submit that an applicant whose  application  for  leave  to  remain  is
    improperly rejected in reliance on that policy might nevertheless  wait
    for the respondent to consider her human rights claim in the fulness of
    time.  Such a solution confines an applicant to the hostile environment
    improperly and indefinitely, which is unjustifiable in the case  of  an
    adult  applicant  and  contrary  to  the  best  interests  of  a  child
    applicant.  In any event, it is for  the  respondent  to  show  that  a
    person  whose  application  for  leave  to  remain   is   rejected   is
    nevertheless protected effectively from removal by the acceptance  that
    they have made a human rights claim under s113 of  the  2002  Act.   No
    such acceptance is communicated  to  the  individual.   It  is  unclear
    whether any such acceptance is recorded internally and, if  it  is,  at
    what stage and by what means.  If the respondent's submission  is  that
    decisions such as the present can never be incompatible with  the  ECHR
    because individuals such as the applicants will not be removed  without
    consideration of their human rights, the evidence before  me  does  not
    support the existence of that  protection  and  the  respondent's  late
    adoption of that stance in this case and  others  calls  it  positively
    into question.

127. It was submitted in the post-hearing note filed by  Mr  Mackenzie  that
    the respondent's position in relation to the making of a  human  rights
    claim had changed since Shrestha and  MY  (Pakistan).   The  respondent
    maintained that there has been no change in her position, and that  the
    note handed up during the hearing merely replicated her stance  in  the
    earlier cases.  As will be apparent from the conclusions I  have  drawn
    above, I have not considered it necessary to  resolve  those  competing
    submissions.  As requested by  Mr  Mackenzie,  I  have  reproduced  the
    respondent's note in full in case it might be of significance in future
    cases.  Whilst it is not material to my decision, my conclusion on  the
    competing submissions is as follows.


128. The submission made by Ms Giovannetti at [14] of Ahsan comprised  three
    parts.  Firstly, an acceptance  that  a  human  rights  claim  was  not
    required to be made in the form of a fee  paid  application  under  the
    Rules.  Secondly, that a human rights claim ought however to be made by
    way of a formal application for leave to remain and that priority would
    be given to claims made in that way.  Thirdly, that  even  if  a  human
    rights claim was made in some  other  way,  a  claimant  would  not  be
    removed until it had been considered.


129. These elements  were  also  present  in  the  submissions  made  by  Mr
    Thomann, on behalf of the Secretary of State, in Shrestha.  As noted, I
    was helpfully provided with the written submissions made in  that  case
    upon request.  Paragraph  [14]  of  Ahsan  was  cited  at  [20]  of  Mr
    Thomann's  written  submissions.   At  [21],  he  submitted  that   the
    respondent had acted lawfully in requiring the applicant  to  make  his
    application for leave to remain  in  compliance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Immediately thereafter, at [22],  the  respondent's  submission
    was:

         It is accepted that the Secretary of State is not actually able  to
         remove the Appellant without, in due course, considering his  claim
         to remain under Article 8 of the Convention (see Ahsan, at [14]).

130. With  respect,  [33]  of  Hickinbottom  LJ's  judgment  reflects  these
    submissions precisely.  That paragraph (which I have reproduced  above)
    begins by noting the respondent's acceptance that she could not  remove
    the applicant without considering his human rights claim  and  ends  by
    concluding that the applicant would not suffer injustice as a result of
    the Secretary of State "refusing to consider his human rights claim  at
    this stage".  Mr Mackenzie is therefore wrong to submit,  at  [12],  of
    his post-hearing note,  that  the  respondent  adopted  a  position  in
    Shrestha whereby she was not obliged to consider a human  rights  claim
    which had been made in the wrong form 'at all'.  As is clear  from  the
    excerpts above, her position in Shrestha was to  accept  that  a  human
    rights claim had been made, and that it would  have  to  be  considered
    before removal, but that she was not required to "treat and  determine"
    that human rights claim as an application for leave to remain on  human
    rights grounds.  So it was  that  the  respondent  submitted  that  the
    notification of a human rights claim in response to a notice under s120
    of the 2002 Act could not amount to an application for leave to  remain
    under the Immigration Rules.


131. Nor do  I  consider  the  respondent's  submissions  before  me  to  be
    inconsistent with her stance in MY (Pakistan).  She accepted  in  terms
    in that case that a human rights claim had been made: [53] refers.  She
    maintained that she had not refused the claim because she had, instead,
    refused to engage with it because it had not been made in  form  of  an
    application for leave to remain.  There is no suggestion in the  record
    of the respondent's submissions or in the  decision  of  the  Tribunal,
    however, that the respondent had departed from the position  in  Ahsan,
    that she was required to consider the human rights claim which had been
    made at some indeterminate  point prior to removal.


132. For the reasons set out at [1]-[126], I conclude that the  respondent's
    policy is unlawful and that the decision taken pursuant to it  in  this
    case was unlawful.  This judgment will be  handed  down  electronically
    due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  I therefore invite  written  submissions
    on relief and the form of any order.

Supplemental Judgment

133. With the agreement of the parties, this judgment will  be  handed  down
    by email.  Negotiations between the parties regarding the form of order
    were  unsuccessful.   I  have  had  regard  to  their  submissions   in
    formulating the order.  In respect of each  point  of  disagreement,  I
    prefer the submissions made by Mr Malik.


134.  Mr  Malik  has  made  brief  written  submissions  in  support  of  an
    application for permission to appeal.  He submits that it is  at  least
    arguable that the respondent's guidance is lawful and that the decision
    taken pursuant to it was also lawful.  In the alternative,  he  submits
    that the 'profound consequences' of my decision are such that there  is
    a compelling reason for the matter to be considered  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal.   Mr  Mackenzie  submits  that   the   former   submission   is
    unmeritorious and that the latter is for the Court of Appeal to decide.

135. Although I am not persuaded by Mr Malik's first submission, I  consider
    that there is another compelling reason for an appeal to be heard.   As
    Stewart J observed in Carter, that reason is to be found in the  impact
    on the fee waiver system and the important points of principle  in  the
    case.  I grant permission to appeal on that basis.

136. If I understand  CPR  52.16  correctly,  it  is  a  consequence  of  my
    decision  to  grant  permission  to  appeal  that  the  effect  of   my
    substantive decision is stayed pending the determination of the appeal.
     In the event that I am wrong in that, I order under  rule  5(3)(l)  of
    the Upper Tribunal Rules that  the  effect  of  my  decision  shall  be
    suspended pending the appeal.

Postscript

On 25 June 2020, the Secretary of State confirmed  that  she  would  not  be
lodging an Appellant's Notice with the Civil Appeals  Office  and  that  she
was content, in the circumstances, for the suspension of the effect  of  the
Upper Tribunal's decision to come to an end immediately.


-----------------------
[1] This was the term used throughout the hearing,  although  it  is  nearly
two years since the former  Home  Secretary  indicated  his  preference  for
'compliant environment'.
[2] "human rights claim"  means a claim made by a person  to  the  Secretary
of State at a place designated by the Secretary of State that to remove  the
person from or require him to leave the United  Kingdom  or  to  refuse  him
entry into the United Kingdom would be  unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) (public  authority  not  to  act  contrary  to
Convention)
[3] I note that Underhill LJ used similar language in Ahsan, at [123],
referring to an individual who had made a human rights claim which had not
been refused being 'left entirely in the hands of the Secretary of State
and may have to pass many weeks or months in limbo'.
