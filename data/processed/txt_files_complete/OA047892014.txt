                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this  appeal  but
    in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Kempton promulgated  on
    27  January  2015  which  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on  26  February  1995  and  is  a  national  of
    Bangladesh.

 4. The Appellant applied for entry clearance to join her  husband  Mohamed
    Runu Miah.

 5. On 13 March  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:

      a) The letter conceded that the sponsor was exempted from meeting  the
         requirements of Paragraph E-ECP.3.1 as they are in receipt  of  DLA
         but they must however meet the requirements of E-ECP.3.3  and  show
         that  the  Sponsor  is  able  to  maintain  and  accommodate   them
         adequately in the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds.

      b) The sponsor is in receipt of DLA of �74 per week which is less that
         the �112.55 that a couple require  after  accommodation  costs  per
         week

      c) The bank statement from the sponsor's mother does  not  demonstrate
         that she is genuinely in a position to meet the costs of having the
         Appellant and his spouse living there.

The Judge's Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Kempton  ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the   appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decision. The Judge found :

      a) Given that  the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  DLA  the  financial
         requirements of Appendix FM did not apply.

      b) The sponsor lives in a house wholly owned by his mother  which  has
         no mortgage.

      c) The sponsor receives �76.00 DLA per week and  a  couple  on  income
         support would receive �111.45.

      d) The sponsor has no costs arising out of living with his mother  and
         can do as he pleases with his DLA.

      e) The arrival of the Appellant would make little financial difference
         to the costs of running the home.

      f)  The  Appellant  can  be  adequately  accommodated  and  maintained
         although  the  sponsor's  income  is  below  the   income   support
         threshold.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged on the basis that it was not open to  the
    Judge to find that the Appellant and his wife could adequately maintain
    and accommodate themselves without recourse to public funds when  their
    income was below income support level  as  this  failed  to  take  into
    account the case of KA and Others (Adequacy  of  maintenance)  Pakistan
    [2006] UKAIT 00065.

 8. On 16 March 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Astle  gave  permission  to
    appeal stating that the Judge fell into error in failing to follow KA.

 9. At the hearing I heard submissions from Ms Johnstone on behalf  of  the
    Respondent that :

      a) She relied on the grounds of appeal.

      b) The Judge was not entitled to take into account the availability of
         third part support under Appendix FM.

      c) The Judge was in error failing to take into account: the  level  of
         income support available to a  couple  was  the  minimum  level  of
         income.

      d) There was no housing report.

10. On behalf of the Appellant Mrs Hussain submitted that :

      a) There had been no issue raised in the hearing in  relation  to  the
         adequacy of the accommodation.

      b) There were no costs arising out of the accommodation as  the  house
         was owned outright.

      c) She conceded that the Judge was in error in stating  that  a  level
         below income support level was sufficient but it was  not  material
         because the shortfall could be met by  a  job  offer  made  to  the
         Appellant: she would be able to work for 14 hours  a  week  at  the
         national minimum wage.

11. In reply Ms Johnstone on behalf of the  submitted that:

      a) The evidence of the job offer for the Appellant was not before  the
         ECO.

Finding on Material Error

12. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made material errors of law.

13. This was an application for entry clearance as a spouse under  Appendix
    FM. It was accepted by the Respondent in the refusal  letter  that  the
    Appellant's sponsor was in receipt of Disability Living  Allowance  and
    as a result was not required to meet the minimum income  threshold  set
    out in E-ECP.3.1. The Appellant was however required to demonstrate  by
    reference to paragraph E-ECP.3.3 that their sponsor their  partner  was
    able to maintain and accommodate  themselves,  the  applicant  and  any
    dependants adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds.

14. It is argued that the Judge erred in her assessment of adequacy because
    she found that the sponsor was in receipt of a sum that was  less  than
    that which a couple would receive income support. It is suggested  that
    the Judge erred in failing to take into account the guidance  given  in
    KA as to adequacy. I am satisfied that the Judge erred however what was
    said in KA  has now been incorporated into the Rules in that there is a
    definition of adequacy in the Interpretation section of  the  rules  at
    paragraph 6:

         "'adequate' and 'adequately'  in  relation  to  a  maintenance  and
         accommodation  requirement  shall  mean  that,  after  income  tax,
         national  insurance  contributions  and  housing  costs  have  been
         deducted, there must be available to the family the level of income
         that would be available to them if the family  was  in  receipt  of
         income support."

15. I am satisfied that the acceptance by the Judge that a  sum  less  than
    the level of income support for a couple was a material error  of  law.
    Mrs Hussain suggests that the shortfall could be made  up  by  the  job
    offer available to the Appellant's spouse. This  evidence  however  was
    not before the decision maker and the Judge was  required  to  consider
    the circumstances at the date of the decsion

16. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that the
    Judge's determination cannot stand and must be set to be remade.

17. I had invited Mrs Hussain and Ms  Johhnstone  to  make  any  additional
    submissions they wished in relation either to the Rules  or  Article  8
    and I would take them into account.

Remaking the Decision.

18. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh who made an  application  for
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom to join her  husband  who  is  in
    receipt of DLA.

19. The Appellant is required to show that in relation to a maintenance and
    that, after income tax, national insurance  contributions  and  housing
    costs have been deducted, there must be available  to  the  family  the
    level of income that would be available to them if the  family  was  in
    receipt of income support. The Appellant and his  wife  would  have  no
    housing costs arising from living with his parents but I  am  satisfied
    that the total he receives in DLA payments per week is �76.00 which  is
    less than the relevant income support of �111.45 per  week.  This  does
    not meet the definition in the Rules  of  adequacy  and  therefore  the
    Appellant cannot succeed under the Rules.

20. In relation to claims under Article 8 these are addressed  by  Appendix
    FM and paragraph 276ADE of the  Rules  and  the  Secretary  of  State's
    Guidance. If an applicant does not meet the criteria  set  out  in  the
    Rules then guidance issued by the Secretary of State  in  the  form  of
    instructions provides in effect, that leave to remain outside the rules
    could be granted in the exercise of residual discretion in 'exceptional
    circumstances' which are defined in the guidance and must be  exercised
    on the basis of Article 8 considerations, in particular  assessing  all
    relevant factors in determining whether  a  decision  is  proportionate
    under Article 8.2.

21. It is now generally accepted that the new IRs do not provide in advance
    for every nuance in the application of Article 8 in  individual  cases.
    At para 30 of Nagre, Sales J said:

         "30.     ... if, after the process of applying the  new  rules  and
         finding that the claim for leave to remain under  them  fails,  the
         relevant official or tribunal judge considers it is clear that  the
         consideration under the Rules has fully addressed any  family  life
         or private life  issues  arising  under  Article  8,  it  would  be
         sufficient simply to say that; they would not have  to  go  on,  in
         addition, to consider the case separately from the Rules. If  there
         is no arguable case that there may be  good  grounds  for  granting
         leave to remain outside the Rules by reference to Article 8,  there
         would be no point in introducing  full  separate  consideration  of
         Article 8 again after having reached a decision on  application  of
         the Rules."

22. This was also endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Singh and Khalid where
    Underhill LJ said (at para 64):

         "64.      ...  there  is  no  need  to  conduct  a  full   separate
         examination  of  article  8  outside  the  Rules  where,   in   the
         circumstances of a  particular  case,  all  the  issues  have  been
         addressed in the consideration under the Rules."

23. More recently the Court of Appeal in  SS  Congo  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387
    stated in paragragh 33:

         "In our judgment, even though a test  of  exceptionality  does  not
         apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
         accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of
         special contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances
         would need to be identified to support a claim  for  grant  of  LTR
         outside the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  In  our  view,  that  is  a
         formulation which is not as strict as a test of exceptionality or a
         requirement of "very compelling reasons"  (as  referred  to  in  MF
         (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to  foreign
         criminals), but which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
         consideration of public interest factors as finds expression in the
         Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in  Appendix  FM.
         It also reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which  has
         been tested and has survived scrutiny in  this  court:  see,  e.g.,
         Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ. "

24. I am obliged if making a 'free standing' Article 8 assessment  to  take
    into account  Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014) which  sets  out  the
    public  interest  considerations  that  I  must  have  regard   to   in
    determining proportionality.

25. I have considered whether in the circumstances of this case all of  the
    issues have been addressed in the  consideration  under  the  Rules  or
    whether compelling circumstances exist to justify consideration of  the
    case outside the Rules under Article 8.

26. Mrs Hussain argued that the Appellant's sponsor  is  a  United  Kingdom
    citizen who has significant health problems that have impacted  on  his
    ability to work and resulted in him being awarded DLA as  a  result  of
    hearing and speech loss. He said the only available work for him  would
    have been with his brother but he had thought it  was  better  for  his
    wife to work. She conceded that he  would  be  able  to  work  for  his
    brother and thereby meet the requirements of the Rules but this was  an
    unnecessary additional burden to impose on him and his wife in terms of
    delay and costs.

27. The fact that the Appellant's sponsor is a United Kingdom citizen is  a
    requirement  of  the  Rules  not   a   compelling   circumstance   that
    automatically entitles him to bring a  spouse  to  the  United  Kingdom
    regardless of whether he meets the requirements of the Rules. While  at
    the time of this application  Mrs Hussain concedes that  the  Appellant
    was not working and was in receipt of DLA it is clear that this  was  a
    matter of choice and she conceded  that  he  could  in  fact  work  and
    supplement his state benefits to meet the requirement of adequacy under
    the Rules. The fact that the Appellant could meet the Rules  but  would
    prefer not to have to is  not,  in  my  view  a  compelling  reason  to
    consider this appeal under Article 8 outside the Rules.  The  financial
    requirements of the Rules have been upheld by the higher courts .

28. If I were wrong about this and the circumstances justified  looking  at
    the case outside the Rules  I  am  satisfied  that  if  I  applied  the
    questions set out in Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  and  accepted  that  the
    Appellant and his spouse had a right to respect for their  family  life
    and the refusal of entry clearance  interfered  with  that  right;  the
    decision would be in accordance with the law;  the  decision  would  be
    necessary in the interests of the economic well being  of  the  through
    the maintenance of the requirements of a policy of immigration control.



29. The provisions of section 117B  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002  require me to  take  into  account  in  assessing  the
    public interest that the maintenance of effective immigration  controls
    is in the public interest: thus if the Appellant can meet the Rules she
    should be required to do so. In relation to  requiring  that  they  are
    adequately maintained it is in the public interest, and  in  particular
    in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
    persons who  seek  to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
    financially independent.

30. The issue would come down to one of proportionality. I have  considered
    whether in fact the Appellant and her husband  could  reasonably  enjoy
    family life in Bangladesh. Mrs Hussain suggests they could not  as  the
    sponsor could not find employment or family support  there.  I  do  not
    accept that these are persuasive arguments: he does not currently  work
    in the United Kingdom and while  he  would  lose  the  support  of  his
    immediate family he would have the support  of  his  wife's  family  in
    Bangladesh. Nevertheless that fact is that is  not  what  is  going  to
    happen because Mrs Hussain concedes that the sponsor could in fact find
    work in the United Kingdom with his brother and meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules. The Appellant and her spouse knew when they married  that
    she  could  not  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  unless  she  met   the
    requirements of the Rules. Paragraphs 37-40 in SS Congo reminds me that
    the family life  was  therefore  established  against  this  precarious
    background, that the state  has  a  wider  margin  of  appreciation  in
    determining the conditions to be satisfied before LTE  is  granted,  by
    contrast with the position in relation to decisions regarding  LTR  for
    persons with a (non-precarious) family life already established in  the
    United Kingdom.

31. In determining whether  the  refusal  would  be  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim of immigration control I find that  none  of  the  facts
    underpinning the Appellants life in the  United  Kingdom  taken  either
    singularly or cumulatively  outweigh  the  legitimate  purpose  of  the
    Appellants removal.

Decision

32. I set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
    material error of law. I substitute the following decision:

33. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

34. This appeal is also dismissed on human rights grounds (Article 8)
