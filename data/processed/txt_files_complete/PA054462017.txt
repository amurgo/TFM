                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Aitken, instructed by UK Lawyers & Advisors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. Mr [A] made an international protection and human rights claim.
            Both were refused by the respondent for reasons set  out  in  a
            decision dated 22nd May 2017. For reasons set out in a decision
            promulgated on 3rd August 2017, First-tier Tribunal Judge  J  K
            Swaney dismissed the appeal  against  the  decision  to  refuse
            international protection and allowed  the  appeal  against  the
            decision to refuse the human rights claim (Article 8).


         2. The respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal  the
            decision allowing the Article 8 claim. The  appellant  did  not
            seek permission to appeal the dismissal  of  his  international
            protection claim.

         3. For the reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 11th April
            2018, Upper Tribunal Judge Lane found material errors of law in
            the decision by the First-tier Tribunal, set aside the decision
            in so far as it was concerned with Article 8 to be  remade,  no
            findings preserved. A transfer order was made, and  the  appeal
            eventually came before me for hearing on 13th November 2018.

         4. The appellant's solicitors had not filed the documents on which
            they intended to rely, in accordance with directions I made  in
            September 2018. Nevertheless, I had some of the documents which
            had been handed in  in  September  and  on  conclusion  of  the
            hearing on 13th November Mr Aitken provided me with his  bundle
            of  documents.  I  also  had  two  letters  from  Chelsea   and
            Westminster Hospital in connection with the  appellant's  niece
            and Mr Aitken's skeleton argument prepared for this hearing and
            his skeleton prepared for the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
            Tribunal.

         5. I heard oral evidence from the appellant, his  sister  and  his
            brother-in-law. Although there was an interpreter  present,  Mr
            [A] gave virtually the whole of his evidence in English and  it
            was evident that he was fluent  in  English.  Mr  [A]'s  sister
            required some assistance from the interpreter and his  brother-
            in-law required none.

            Undisputed background

         6. The appellant is an Algerian Citizen, born  on  12th  September
            1988. He is single. He first arrived in the UK  on  3rd  August
            2009 as a visitor and returned to Algeria on completion of  his
            visit on 16th November 2009. A second application for  a  visit
            visa was refused. His next application for  a  visit  visa  was
            granted and he came to the  UK  on  21st  December  2013  as  a
            visitor. He did not leave the UK on expiry of his  visit  visa.
            Throughout his time in the UK he has  lived  with  his  sister,
            brother-in-law and their children.


         7. On 1st September 2016 he was convicted of possession/control of
            identity  documents  with  intent  and  possession/control   of
            documents belonging to another for which  he  received  a  six-
            month sentence, suspended for 12  months,  a  3-month  sentence
            suspended  for  12  months   to   run   concurrently   and   an
            electronically monitored curfew for 2 months.

         8. The appellant's sister, a British Citizen,  was  born  on  21st
            November 1974 in Algeria. She has been in the UK  for  over  20
            years. She is diagnosed with Type II diabetes  and  high  blood
            pressure for which she is prescribed medication.   She  is  the
            full-time carer of her husband and  receives  the  full  Carers
            Allowance.

         9. The appellant's brother in law, date  of  birth  17th  February
            1962, and married to the appellant's sister, has been in the UK
            for over 20 years. He worked as a black cab driver until  about
            a year ago when he was  forced  to  give  up  work  because  of
            serious illness. He is a British Citizen. He has a brother here
            in the UK, who is also a black cab driver, who is married  with
            three children aged under 16. He sees his brother every  couple
            of weeks or so when his brother is in the area. The brother and
            his family do not and cannot, I accept,  provide  any  physical
            care or support. He has other relatives  in  Algeria  including
            his parents. The evidence from the medical  reports  that  were
            sent to his GP from his various treating  oncologists  say  the
            following:

                    . In February 2016 he was  diagnosed  as  having  right
                      sided lung cancer;
                    . In May 2016 he had a right sided lobectomy
                    . In September  2017  there  were  recently  identified
                      adenocarcinoma  cells  in   right   sided   pulmonary
                      effusion
                    . October 2017 a  letter  confirms  he  has  metastatic
                      adenocarcinoma to both lungs with  EGFR  mutation  of
                      the exon 19 deletion
                    . He has asthma
                    . He has Crohns disease
                    . Between November 2016 and January 2017, he  had  five
                      admissions to hospital
                    . he is troubled with viral  infections,  and  although
                      infections may resolve themselves he is  at  risk  of
                      further  infections   and   lung   related   problems
                      including pleural effusions which require drainage.

        10. The appellant's brother-in-law and sister travelled to  Algeria
            for about 5 weeks during the summer for the  expressed  purpose
            of the brother-in-law being  able  to  say  "good-bye"  to  his
            family there, having been told  in  July  2017  that  his  life
            expectancy was much reduced, to some two years.


        11. There are four children (all born in the  UK  and  all  British
            citizens), 3 boys and a girl: the  oldest  two,  boys,  are  in
            their late  teens  and  are  young  adults;  one  is  going  to
            university in January 2019 and the other  is  at  college.  The
            youngest, also a boy, is now just 9 years old. The daughter, is
            15 and has had serious physical health  issues  and  continuing
            stress related issues.

        12.  In  2017,  after  numerous  recurrent  episodes  of  loss   of
            consciousness and sharp chest pain, the daughter was  diagnosed
            with secundum atrial septal defect. In March 2018 she underwent
            percutaneous closure of the ASD with a septal occlude which has
            been successful. She spent some 6 weeks in hospital. On  review
            in October 2018 the paediatric  cardiologist  notified  her  GP
            that the procedure appeared successful but that she  was  still
            having recurrent symptoms of vasovagal-type episodes  and  left
            sided chest pain. The report states that there was a functional
            component and that she had been engaging  with  the  psychology
            team.

        13. The appellant was  put  forward  for  and  undertook  a  Stress
            Control Course during the early part of 2017; he has no current
            depressive or anxiety issues.



  Remaking the decision

        14. Ms Isherwood put the various  reports  and  evidence  from  the
            children to the appellant and questioned why,  given  that  his
            evidence was that he played a full and important  part  in  the
            life of the two younger children, he was  not  referred  to  as
            undertaking this role. His  unshaken  evidence,  supported  and
            confirmed by his sister and brother-in-law was that he played a
            full role  taking  the  daughter  to  school,  collecting  her,
            cleaning  the  house,  gardening,  minor   household   repairs,
            cooking, ensuring the younger boy was able  to  participate  in
            various outdoor games and assisting in the household  generally
            overall. The appellant's brother-in-law was an  impressive  and
            highly credible witness. Although  clearly  in  great  distress
            because of his diagnosis, his positive attitude and desire  for
            his family to be protected  as  much  as  possible  was  highly
            evident. He gave detailed evidence of the decision taken not to
            tell his younger children of his diagnosis and the  discussions
            held with his daughter's psychologist.

        15. I have no doubt, having read the reports and witness statements
            with great care and having  heard  the  oral  evidence  of  the
            appellant, his sister and his brother  in  law  (given  in  the
            absence of each other) that the appellant is  a  necessary  and
            critical part of this family. The ill-health, not only  of  the
            brother-in-law  but  also  the  appellant's  sister  and  their
            daughter, has meant that the burden of  day-to-day  caring  for
            the children as well as the physical aspects of the  home  have
            fallen to the appellant. I found all three witnesses  credible.
            I am satisfied that  during  the  daughter's  lengthy  stay  in
            hospital not only did he care for the  younger  child,  but  he
            assisted the family  to  ensure  that  the  daughter  could  be
            visited, the physical aspects of the household continued to run
            smoothly, and the family was able to function as a family.

        16. I have no doubt at all but that the  appellant  is  a  critical
            member of the family at this very sad  time  and  has  been  so
            since his brother-in-law's  diagnosis.  His  removal  from  the
            family unit could have considerable consequences on the family.
            I find that Article 8 is engaged.

        17. This appeal is not following a deportation  decision,  but  the
            appellant has been convicted of criminal offences for which  he
            received suspended sentences.  He  does  not  fall  within  the
            definition  of  foreign  criminal  in   paragraph   s117D   (2)
            Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  but  I  have
            nevertheless  taken  the  factors  in  s117C  into  account  in
            reaching my decision as well as those set  out  in  s117B.  The
            public interest in the removal of the appellant as a person who
            has breached immigration controls as well as because  he  is  a
            criminal  weigh  heavily  in  the  balance  in  assessing   the
            proportionality of his removal.

        18. That the appellant speaks good English is a neutral  factor  in
            this consideration, but I must, and  do,  also  weigh  into  my
            consideration  the  fact  that  he  came  as  a   visitor   and
            overstayed. I have also borne in mind and  placed  weight  upon
            the fact that his criminal offending occurred very close to his
            brother-in-law's diagnosis. It was  some  two  years  from  his
            entry as a visitor, having therefore  overstayed  for  some  18
            months, before the serious medical problems arose. It was  only
            when those medical problems surfaced that his involvement  with
            the family could be said to change from being an uncle to  that
            of being a critical member of the family. Although he  plays  a
            significant and critical role within the  family  he  does  not
            have parental responsibility for the younger  children  and  he
            does not stand in the shoes of either parent. It cannot be said
            that he has  a  parental  relationship  with  the  two  younger
            children; he has a close, caring and personal  bond  with  them
            because he is their uncle and plays an important role in  their
            life and  the  life  of  the  family  generally.  There  is  no
            question, reasonably, that it would even be considered  by  any
            of the family members that the children would or  could  go  to
            Algeria if he were removed.


        19.  I  note  that  the  appellant  underwent  stress  counselling.
            Although this is to his credit,  given  the  responsibility  he
            feels, but I have placed little weight on this given the public
            interest in his removal both as a criminal and as  someone  who
            has breached immigration control.

        20. The appellant has not been resident in the UK for most  of  his
            life and nor  are  there  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
            reintegration in Algeria. He has been in the UK since  December
            2013, a matter of only five years and 4 � of those  unlawfully.
            He has worked (unlawfully). His integration in UK  society  has
            arisen because of the relationship he has with the family;  the
            problems faced by the family have necessitated his  involvement
            with the children's lives at school and with society  generally
            in as much as the family are all British and have been here for
            so many years. Nevertheless, I have placed little or no  weight
            on this.

        21. Mr Aitken and Ms Isherwood both said that  the  fact  that  the
            appellant is supported by his sister and brother in  law  is  a
            factor against him. Since the date  of  the  hearing,  Rhuppiah
            [2018] UKSC 58 has said that this is not a factor adverse to an
            applicant, but it remains only a factor I have  considered.  It
            is not a matter upon which I have placed much weight other than
            to recognise that he  is,  because  of  the  financial  support
            provided financially independent.

        22. The critical and overwhelming  issue  in  this  appeal  is  the
            relationship this appellant has with the family. Their physical
            dependence could, I do not doubt, be replaced, albeit  at  some
            considerable cost. Some of what he  does  may  be  provided  by
            social services, but the full extent of his physical assistance
            would not be provided on the essentially full-time  basis  that
            he  currently  undertakes.  What  cannot  be  replaced  is  the
            emotional dependency in the broadest and  most  intimate  sense
            between the appellant  and  the  members  of  the  family  both
            individually and as a family. The devastation that would befall
            the two younger children cannot be exaggerated. The daughter is
            already suffering from considerable anxiety both because of her
            own health issues but also because  of  her  awareness  of  her
            father being seriously ill - even though she does not know  the
            full extent of that illness and its impending consequence.  The
            appellant's brother-in-law relies for emotional support on  the
            appellant, as well as  on  his  wife.  The  appellant's  sister
            relies upon the appellant to facilitate the smooth  running  of
            the household not only to enable her to care  for  her  husband
            but also to care for herself. To remove the appellant  at  this
            time in these highly emotional and stressful  times,  when  the
            stresses on the family are  increasing  and  will  continue  to
            increase given what the brother-in-law has been told, is, quite
            simply, disproportionate.


        23. It is the cumulative aspects of the whole family  that  renders
            the decision to remove disproportionate. By themselves, if just
            one individual were affected, the appellant's removal would  be
            proportionate. But  this  tragic  and  highly  unusual  set  of
            circumstances is such that this is one  of  the  almost  unique
            cases where the public interest does not lie in the appellant's
            removal.

        24. I allow the appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds.



    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision in so far as it relates to Article 8.

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  on  human  rights
    grounds - Article 8. The appeal against the protection decision remains
    as reached by the First-tier Tribunal.
