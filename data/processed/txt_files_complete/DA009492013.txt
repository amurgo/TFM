                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a determination of a panel of the  First-
        tier Tribunal composed of First-tier Tribunal Judge Dean and Mr  FT
        Jamieson JP (hereinafter referred to  as  'the  Panel')  who  in  a
        determination  promulgated  on  8th  October  2013  dismissed   the
        Appellant's appeal against the decision  to  deport  her  from  the
        United Kingdom.


     2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on  2nd  January  1988.
        She is a Nigerian citizen born in 1968. The appellant was 19  years
        of age on arrival and was granted a one-month  visitor  visa  valid
        until 2nd February 1988. The Appellant overstayed  and  since  that
        date has never been granted leave to remain.


     3. On 14th August 1989 the Appellant  married  a  British  citizen  of
        Nigerian origin and applied for  leave  to  remain  as  his  spouse
        although at the same time she applied for leave to  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom as a student.


     4. On  31st  May  1990  the  Appellant  was  convicted  at  Marylebone
        Magistrates  Court  of  three  counts  of  Obtaining  Property   by
        Deception, one count of Using a False Instrument, and one count  of
        Obtaining Pecuniary Advantage. The Appellant  was  sentenced  to  3
        months  imprisonment  for  each  offence,  to   run   concurrently,
        suspended for two  years.  On  the  same  date  the  Appellant  was
        convicted of a traffic offence and fined �100.


     5.  On  the  15th  February  1991  the  Appellant  was  convicted   at
        Marlborough Street Magistrates Court  of  Attempting/Obtaining  and
        Handling for which she received a 12 month Probation Order of  each
        offence, to run concurrently.


     6. On 7th November 1991  the  Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
        remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of a British citizen and
        as a student were both refused.


     7. On 18th October  1993  the  Appellant  was  convicted  of  what  is
        recorded on the PNC as Foreign Leg/Handling Theft Act 1968 s.22 and
        Foreign Leg/Using False Instrument, Forgery and Counterfeiting  Act
        1981 s.3" which is listed as having taken  place  at  the  Criminal
        Court in Ancona, Italy.  The Appellant was sentenced to  two  years
        six months and fifteen days  imprisonment  for  the  first  offence
        together with a fine of 1,500,000 Italian Lira.


     8. A notice of intention to deport was issued on 24th March  1994  and
        her appeal against the decision refused on 14th December 1994.


     9. On 12th April 1995 the Appellant  was  convicted  at  Harrow  Crown
        Court of eighteen counts of obtaining  property  by  deception  and
        three counts of false accounting for which she was sentenced to two
        years imprisonment.


    10. On 27th October 1995 the Appellant applied for  asylum,  which  was
        refused on 9th May 1997.


    11. On 21st August 1998, at St Albans Crown Court,  the  Appellant  was
        convicted of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to  thirty  months
        imprisonment and recommended to be deported. The Panel  noted  that
        in  a  letter  to  the  Respondent  dated   3rd   September   1998,
        Hertfordshire Constabulary stated the Appellant had  been  involved
        in various deceptions, with others,  in  which  �200,000  had  been
        obtained.  A deportation order dated 28th October 1998  was  served
        on the Appellant on 21st November 1998 although for  legal  reasons
        it was revoked by the Respondent on 11th September 1999.


    12. On 22nd August 1999 the Appellant had applied for leave  to  remain
        in the United Kingdom as an overstayer which was  refused  on  20th
        May 2003.


    13. On 10th  January  2002,  at  West  London  Magistrates  Court,  the
        Appellant was convicted  of  one  count  of  attempting  to  obtain
        property by deception  and  one  count  of  obtaining  property  by
        deception for which she was sentenced  to  a  Community  Punishment
        Order of 150 hours and ordered to pay �1,200 compensation.


    14. On 14th May 2003 a deportation decision letter was  issued  by  the
        Respondent and on 15th May 2003 a deportation order was issued.


    15. On 8th December 2003 the Appellant applied for leave to  remain  in
        the United Kingdom, relying on Article 8 ECHR, which was refused on
        15th December 2003.


    16. On 18th February  2004,  at  West  London  Magistrates  Court,  the
        Appellant  was  convicted  of  attempting/obtaining   property   by
        deception and handling stolen goods (receiving) and sentenced to  a
        Community Punishment Order of 150 hours.


    17. On 12th October 2007 the Respondent advised the Appellant that  the
        deportation order issued  in  2003  was  being  revoked  for  legal
        reasons but advised the  Appellant  that  she  might  still  remain
        liable to deportation.


    18. On 10th May 2008, at Medway Magistrates Court,  the  Appellant  was
        convicted of shoplifting and fined  �250.  On  24th  May  2011,  at
        Woolwich Magistrates Court, the Appellant was convicted of  driving
        a motor vehicle with excess alcohol, fined �125,  and  disqualified
        from driving for sixteen months.


    19. On 10th March 2013 the  Appellant  was  issued  with  a  notice  of
        liability to deportation together with a questionnaire to which she
        replied on 10th April 2013. On 25 April 2013 the Respondent made  a
        decision to make a deportation order and it is the  appeal  against
        this decision that came before the Panel.


    20. An analysis of the PNC shows the Appellant as  having  thirty  nine
        convictions for fraud or kindred  offences,  four  convictions  for
        theft or kindred offences, three miscellaneous offences, the use of
        ten alias names, and that her last recorded conviction is 10th  May
        2011.


    21. It was conceded before the Panel, on the Appellant's  behalf,  that
        the appeal was being pursued on the substantive grounds relating to
        her family and private life under Article 8 ECHR  only  as  it  was
        accepted that the Appellant could not  qualify  under  any  of  the
        provisions of the Immigration  Rules.   It  was  also  stated  that
        although there was medical evidence, no separate  claim  was  being
        made under Article's 3 or  8  on  medical  grounds,  although  that
        evidence was being relied upon as part of the claim to private life
        under Article 8 ECHR [18].


    22. In relation to her family life, the Panel noted that the  Appellant
        is not married and has no children of her own.  She  has  a  sister
        who lives in Kent who has a son who is now aged 13.  It was claimed
        there  are  also  two  sisters  living  in  Scotland  although   no
        additional evidence regarding the sisters in  Scotland  was  before
        the Panel which led to a finding that the claim to have such family
        members in Scotland  was  very  weak  [21].   In  relation  to  the
        relatives in Kent; it was found that having examined  the  totality
        of the evidence the family relationship between the  Appellant  and
        her sister is not as close as has been claimed [26].  This  finding
        was made on the basis of evidence containing  a  different  address
        for the Appellant from  that  of  her  sister  [26],  the  lack  of
        sufficient evidence to corroborate the claimed  relationship  [27],
        and material inconsistencies  between  the  oral  evidence  of  the
        Appellant and her sister [28].  The Panel rejected  the  claim  the
        Appellant lived with her sister [29] and did not  accept  that  she
        had told the truth before the Tribunal. Her account  of  the  facts
        was found to be a "narrative of convenience" designed to  establish
        that she had a close family relationship with her sister and nephew
        which, on the evidence considered in the round, it  was  found  she
        does not.


    23. The Panel found that the relationship between the Appellant and her
        sister and nephew did not go beyond normal emotional  ties  between
        family members  [30]  and  that  contact  could  be  maintained  by
        indirect methods if the Appellant was deported.


    24. The Panel concluded  that  as  a  result,  the  deportation  is  be
        proportionate to the legitimate aim and would not breach Article  8
        which is suggestive of legal error but  not  one  material  to  the
        decision relating  to  the  lack  of  family  life.   I  make  this
        observation for if no family  life  exists  it  is  unnecessary  to
        proceed to consider the remaining elements of the  legal  test  set
        out in Razgar. The primary finding of the Panel is that it had  not
        been proved that the relationship with the sister and  nephew  were
        such that family life recognised by Article 8 was found to exist.


    25. The  Appellants  claim  to  be  in  a  relationship  with  a  named
        individual was also found to be affected  by  conflicting  evidence
        and the lack of suitable evidence proving a close relationship. The
        Panel found the evidence taken at its highest established they were
        friends  but  not  that  the  relationship  was  capable  of  being
        recognised as family life [31].  The Panel also noted that both the
        Appellant and the named individual accepted that they entered  into
        the friendship in full  knowledge  of  the  Appellant's  precarious
        immigration status and the fact  she  might  be  removed  from  the
        United Kingdom.


    26.  In  relation  to  private  life  elements;  the  Panel  noted  the
        immigration history [32], the medical evidence relied upon  by  the
        Appellant [33], and the fact that over the period of time  she  has
        been in the United Kingdom  the  Appellant  will  have  established
        private life [34], before concluding that on the  totality  of  the
        evidence the private life amounted to no more than ordinary day-to-
        day life, friendships and education, which it was  found  could  be
        pursued in Nigeria [34].


    27. The primary finding of the panel is therefore that Article 8 is not
        engaged in relation to either family or private  life.  The  Panel,
        however, went on to consider the position in the alternative as  if
        Article 8 was engaged in relation to which  they  found  that  when
        balancing the competing interests the  decision  was  proportionate
        [35].


    28. The chronology above shows there have been substantial  periods  of
        delay in this matter coming to a hearing and the  Panel  considered
        the effect of this in paragraph 36 of the determination.  They  set
        out the correct legal self-direction that delay is a factor  to  be
        weighed in the balance but that delay will rarely be  gross  enough
        to render an otherwise lawful decision unlawful.   The  Panel  note
        that the Respondent's intention to deport the Appellant  was  known
        to her, that she was unable to  regularise  the  status,  and  that
        despite having no permission to remain in the United Kingdom  after
        1991 and knowing that  she  was  at  risk  of  being  deported  she
        continued to commit serious  criminal  offences  of  deception  and
        dishonesty. The Panel refer to the quality of the private life  the
        Appellant established which would have  been  enhanced  during  the
        period of any delay, but did not find that the delay was such as to
        make  the  decision  disproportionate.  The  appeal  was  therefore
        dismissed.


    29. The  grounds  challenging  that  decision  allege  the  credibility
        assessment  is  flawed  as  a  result  of  the  Appellant  recently
        suffering a brain haemorrhage which is said to  have  affected  her
        memory.  It is asserted that the assessment of  credibility  should
        have  considered  the  evidence  especially  as  a  discharge  from
        hospital note of the 10th August 2013  has  endorsed  upon  it  "GP
        please assess this patient for memory problems".


    30. There is also a challenge to the weight given by the Panel to other
        aspects of the  evidence  which  were  found  to  be  part  of  the
        conclusion of the  Panel  that  there  were  discrepancies  in  the
        evidence.


    31.  In  relation  to  Article  8  ECHR,  it  is   alleged   that   the
        proportionality assessment  was  not  balanced,  factors  regarding
        delay in  revocation  of  the  deportation  before  the  Panel  are
        significant, reference to the period of delay,  and  the  fact  the
        'high point' in her convictions was 15 years ago in 1998 .


    32. It was accepted there was nothing exceptional about the  Appellants
        case but submitted there are exceptional features such as the total
        inaction and behaviour of the Secretary of State and their  failure
        to take any action in relation to  the  deportation  order.  It  is
        acknowledged  that  although  offences  were  committed  after  the
        decision to revoke the deportation order was made, it is said those
        offences are at the lower  end  of  the  scale  and  would  not  of
        themselves have triggered an automatic deportation decision.


    33. It is also alleged that the principle of deterrence in  the  public
        interest assessment is flawed as the Appellant has changed the ways
        and  only  committed  two  minor  offences  since  the   revocation
        decision.



Discussion



    34. It is accepted the Appellant has  an  adverse  immigration  history
        together with an adverse record  of  criminal  behaviour  and  that
        there has been considerable delay in the Secretary of State  taking
        any appropriate action in relation to this Appellant.


    35. The fact there  has  been  delay  does  not  make  the  deportation
        decision unlawful such as to mean the  Secretary  of  State  cannot
        deport the Appellant at this stage, although any  period  of  delay
        will have enabled her to further develop the family and/or  private
        life that she relies upon. The  approach  taken  by  the  Panel  in
        relation to this element of the appeal has not  been  shown  to  be
        affected by any error of law material to the decision.


    36. In relation to the credibility  assessment,  it  is  accepted  that
        there is mention in the medical  evidence  of  a  request  for  the
        Appellant's GP to assess her for any memory problems but there  was
        no  evidence  before  the  Panel  that  this  assessment  had  been
        undertaken. As a result there was no medical  evidence  before  the
        Panel  to  show  that  the  Appellant  was  suffering  from  memory
        problems.   The  evidence  from  the  Appellant  was   by   witness
        statements and oral evidence and at the outset of her  evidence  in
        chief it is recorded that she sought to  rely  upon  the  documents
        that she had provided with no further questions being asked of  her
        by Miss Record at that stage. The Appellant was  thereafter  cross-
        examined and from reading of the  transcript  of  the  proceedings,
        which is in legible form, it appears that the Appellant was able to
        answer questions put to her as indeed were all the other witnesses.


    37.  In  her  submissions  to  the  Panel  Miss  Record  is  noted   as
        acknowledging that there are inconsistencies in the account but her
        main  submission  was  that  in  general  the  Appellant  had  been
        consistent in the core of her account, indicating  the  Panel  were
        being asked to put weight upon what the  Appellant  had  stated  in
        evidence and not to reduce such weight as a result of memory issues
        which, if they exist, must be relevant to all  the  evidence  given
        and not selective elements deemed to harm her case.


    38. It was accepted in submissions before the Upper Tribunal  that  the
        panel have produced a detailed determination and, in reality,  this
        is a challenge to the weight the Panel gave to the evidence.


    39. The Panel accepted that the Appellant has  been  receiving  medical
        attention and refer to a letter  from  her  GP  handed  up  at  the
        hearing from the Falmouth Road Group Practice dated 30th  September
        2013. This letter explains that  the  Appellant  suffered  a  brain
        hemorrhage in July 2013. It  also  states  she  has  suffered  from
        chronic depression  since  2003.  A  number  of  other  issues  are
        mentioned but in relation to the relevance of these matters to  the
        Appellants case the letter only states: "I would appreciate if  you
        take into consideration her  tragic  circumstances  which  lead  to
        adverse impact on her physical and mental health problems".


    40. Miss Record was asked what she is asking the Upper Tribunal to find
        in relation to this issue to which she responded  by  stating  that
        she wanted it to find that the Panel  should  have  made  the  link
        between the fact the Appellant could not  recall/remember  and  her
        medical procedures. It is  accepted  that  all  the  Panel  had  in
        relation to this issue is the earlier evidence and  the  Appellants
        own oral replies in which she claimed she could not remember.


    41. There are many reasons why a witness may claim they cannot remember
        when questioned about an issue, many not related to  memory  issues
        at all.  As there was no medical evidence supporting  a  claim  the
        Applicant was suffering loss of memory  such  that  reduced  weight
        should be given  to  the  discrepancies  in  the  evidence,  it  is
        difficult to see what else the Panel were  expected  to  have  done
        with the material they were asked to consider.  In  any  event,  in
        light of the lack of evidence relating to this aspect of  the  case
        it is difficult to postulate that all the  unsatisfactory  elements
        of the Appellant's evidence might be explained by such memory  loss
        or what effect, if the same was established, such a disorder had on
        her evidence.


    42. I find the Panel considered  the  material  before  them  with  the
        required degree of anxious scrutiny and gave adequate  reasons  for
        the findings they made. As such the weight  to  be  given  to  that
        evidence was a matter for them. It has not been shown such findings
        are perverse, irrational, or contrary to that evidence.


    43. The assessment of any Article 8 rights had to be conducted  by  the
        Panel in a properly structured manner and in this respect  guidance
        has now been provided by the Senior Courts and Upper  Tribunal  and
        which  is  summarised  in  the  recent  case  of  Shahzad  (Art  8:
        legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC). In Shahzad  it  was  found
        that (a) MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
        immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal are a
        complete code. This was because of the express requirement in  them
        at paragraph 398 to have regard to  exceptional  circumstances  and
        other factors, (b) any other rule which  has  a  similar  provision
        will also constitute a complete code, and (c) Where an area of  the
        rules does not have such an express mechanism, the  approach  in  R
        (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC
        720 (Admin) ([29]-[31] in particular) and Gulshan (Article 8 -  new
        Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) should be followed:
        i.e. after applying the requirements of the rules,  only  if  there
        may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside
        them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider
        whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not   sufficiently
        recognised under them.


    44. The Panel failed to follow such an approach as they went forward to
        consider  an  "old  style"  Article  8  ECHR   assessment   without
        considering the fact the Rules are a complete code in  relation  to
        deportation appeals.


    45.  It  was  conceded  that  the  Appellant  is  unable  to  meet  the
        requirements of the Rules  and  so  issue  for  the  Panel  was  to
        consider was what is exceptional about her circumstances such  that
        she is able to succeed. Miss Record submitted that the evidence  of
        adverse circumstances and the impact on  the  nephew  of  his  aunt
        being removed satisfies such a requirement. The problem with such a
        submission is that there was no/insufficient  evidence  before  the
        Panel to show that the impact upon the child of such an event, even
        if it was established that the ties were as the  Appellant  claims,
        will be such as to make the decision disproportionate.    The  best
        interests of the child will no doubt be to remain with his  parents
        and be cared for by them in the UK.


    46. I find having reviewed the findings and material in  full  that  no
        legal error material to the decision to dismiss the appeal on human
        rights grounds has been  made  out.  The  Appellant  is  unable  to
        satisfy the requirements of the Rules and has not  established  any
        arguable  basis  for  finding  that  circumstances  exist,  on  the
        evidence, warranting the appeal being allowed  outside  the  Rules.
        Even if the Appellant has a family life with her sister and  nephew
        and a relationship with the named individual the fact such  matters
        are considered within the Rules and, even if not, are  impacted  by
        the fact the Appellant has formed such ties during the time she has
        no leave to remaining the UK and that the weight to be attached  to
        the same is limited.  It is also relevant to note  that  these  are
        the elements relied upon by the Appellant and not the only  matters
        the Panel were required to consider. As Miss Record  noted  in  her
        grounds the need is to conduct a balanced assessment and  when  the
        same is undertaken, including the Appellant's history  of  criminal
        behaviour which includes offending when she knew she was at risk of
        deportation,  a  finding  the  decision  is  proportionate  to  the
        legitimate aim relied upon is within  the  range  of  findings  the
        Panel are entitled to make  on  the  evidence.   Even  though  Miss
        Record attempts to mitigate the fact the Appellant  offended  after
        the deportation decision was revoked by reference to the  fact  the
        offences were at the lower end of the scale, she  recognises  there
        were further offences. This demonstrated a continued propensity  to
        commit offences even when the Appellant must have been  aware  that
        to do so made the chance of remaining in the UK even more remote.


Decision

    47. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    48. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, as no request for  the  same
        was made and nor is the need for such an order established  on  the
        facts.
