                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Mensah of Counsel instructed by Gill Law Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan born on the 1st February 1986.
     On the 2nd October  2018  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Shergill)
    allowed his appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 ('the EEA Regs').  The  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted
    that the Respondent Mr Bashir is the full time-carer  for  his  British
    father and accordingly that he has established  a  Zambrano  derivative
    right of residence under Reg 9.


 2.  The Secretary of State now  has  permission  to  appeal  against  that
    decision. The Secretary of State's complaint  is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in two material respects:

              i) In failing to apply the principles  in  Devaseelan  (Second
                 Appeals   -   ECHR   -   Extra-Territorial   Effect)    Sri
                 Lanka* [2002] UKIAT 00702. The First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
                 Malik) had earlier determined as a matter of fact  that  Mr
                 Bashire's father would not leave the  United  Kingdom  with
                 his son, and this First-tier Tribunal was  bound  to  treat
                 that finding as its starting point.


             ii) In failing to apply the  guidance  in  Ayinde  and  Thinjom
                 (Carers - Reg  15A-  Zambrano)  [2015]  UKUT  00650  was  a
                 determination, in particular in failing to consider whether
                 alternative  care  arrangements  were   available   to   Mr
                 Bashire's father


    Discussion and Findings


    Ground (i)

 3. The First-tier Tribunal recognised  that  there  had  been  a  previous
    determination on the same facts at its paragraph 4.  At paragraph 6  it
    specifically recognises the legal implication of that matter:


         "The 2016 decision relates to a hearing on 19/9/16 and there was  a
         repetition  of  some   material/arguments   relied   on   in   this
         application. I am mindful that Deevaseelan  applies.  The  material
         was now somewhat dated and probably was obtained in order to secure
         the appellant's release from detention"


 4. The Tribunal then goes  on  to  consider  whether  there  was  anything
    different in the material before it.  At paragraph 7 it notes  that  in
    2015 the DWP had stated that Mr Bashire's father  required  someone  to
    look over him at night, and found itself satisfied that  this  remained
    the case today.  The same DWP assessment had stated in  terms  that  Mr
    Bashire is his father's sole carer.  It then says this:


         "...The issue in 2016 was dependent and a lack  of  proper  medical
         evidence including a psychiatric report.


         The appellant now relies on a psychiatric report dated 10/11/16 (ie
         after  the  last  hearing)  and  I  am  satisfied  that   this   is
         sufficiently probative new evidence to move away from the  starting
         point in the last decision..."

 5. Ms Mensah strongly contends that these self-directions demonstrated  a)
    that the Tribunal understood that Devaseelan applied here and  b)  that
    it applied the principles therein. I agree.  In her 2016 decision Judge
    Malik had noted [at her ï¿½20] that there was  no  psychiatrist's  report
    before her and that she clearly considered that to be an omission. That
    was an omission that had been rectified before Judge Shergill, and  the
    determination simply reflected that. What is less  clear  is  how  that
    assisted Mr Bashire. This brings me to the second ground.




    Ground (ii)


 6. The Secretary of State's real issue with this determination is that the
    First-tier Tribunal has failed, in making its findings,  to  apply  the
    guidance in Ayinde and Thinjom.   In this reported decision  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Judge Jordan) had found that the  only  question  for  judges
    considering Zambrano applications was whether as a matter of  fact  the
    British citizen would leave the territory of the EU as a consequence of
    the third-country national being required to leave.


 7. There can be no doubt that Judge Shergill did make such a finding:

         "The impact on the father is highly likely to lead to  him  wishing
         to reunite with his son as the only  family  member  he  has.  That
         would mean he would be compelled to leave the territory of the EEA;
         and on balance I conclude that is likely to occur".


 8. Judge Jordan had however not stopped there. His guidance has gone on to
    specify what factors decision makers must take into account in reaching
    that final conclusion of fact (emphasis added:

            57. The Tribunal is entitled to look critically at a claim that
                a person will be forced  to  leave  the  EU  because  of  a
                refusal by the national  authorities  to  grant  his  carer
                leave to remain.  The reason for such a  critical  look  is
                because the claim advanced will be the  very  opposite:  it
                will be a claim that the carer be permitted to  remain  and
                the British citizen will  not  be  required  to  move.   Mr
                Knafler himself referred to this in the course of  argument
                as a paradoxical claim.

            58. Secondly, if the claim is  based  on  the  British  citizen
                being forced to leave the Union,  the  likelihood  of  this
                occurring has to be assessed by reference to  the  benefits
                the Union citizen is  receiving  in  the  UK  and  will  be
                entitled to receive were the appellant to leave.  Hence, if
                the British citizen  is  in  receipt  of  free  healthcare,
                subsidised accommodation (or an allowance to assist in  the
                payment of rent) and state benefits,  pensions  and  fringe
                benefits in  the  form  of  concessions  available  to  the
                elderly, there will be a significant evidential  hurdle  in
                attempting to make out a  case  that  the  British  citizen
                will, as a matter of fact, leave the  United  Kingdom.   In
                reality if these benefits are not available in the  country
                to which he claims he will be forced to travel by reason of
                the refusal of a grant of a derivative  residence  card  to
                his carer, the likelihood of his doing so is likely  to  be
                remote.  Hence the Tribunal will also have to  compare  the
                conditions that a British citizen will meet on being forced
                to settle elsewhere when  assessing  whether  he  is  being
                forced to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.   The  greater  the
                disparity, the less likely it  will  be  that  the  British
                citizen will in fact leave  the  United  Kingdom.   A  bare
                assertion that the British citizen will be forced to  leave
                the United Kingdom is unlikely to be  sufficient;  all  the
                more so if this has been his only home for many years.

            59. Thirdly, whilst these appeals were put on  the  basis  that
                the British citizen has a right to human dignity  which  is
                inviolable  and  must  be  respected  and  protected,  (the
                violation of which acts as the spur to his claim to  be  at
                risk of a forced departure from the United  Kingdom),  some
                care must be taken before reaching such a  conclusion.   It
                is not enough that the British citizen  would  prefer  that
                his carer is  permitted  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
                Kingdom.  There is nothing intrinsically lacking  in  human
                dignity in being offered  the  professional  help  of  care
                workers or being placed into residential accommodation with
                a sliding-scale of support ranging from a home  adapted  to
                the individual's needs, through  to  accommodation  with  a
                warden, through to a  residential  home;  through  to  full
                nursing care.  It would be plainly incorrect to say that it
                is a violation of an individual's rights to  human  dignity
                to be placed into care or to receive help from professional
                healthcare workers.

            60. This leads us back to the words of reg. 15(4A)  (iii)  that
                the British citizen must be unable to reside in the  United
                Kingdom if the appellant were to leave.   These  words  can
                readily be applied in both appeals: Mrs Animashaun  and  Mr
                Stevens are able to reside in the United Kingdom".


 9. I am unable to discern from the decision of Judge Shergill that any  of
    these material questions of fact were considered. Mr  Bashire's  father
    has lived in the United Kingdom since  1971.  He  has  put  down  roots
    through long residence and employment in this country. He relies on his
    state  pension  and  associated  benefits,  and  is  evidently  heavily
    dependent upon the services of the NHS.  Those were material matters of
    fact which should have been weighed in the balance  when  the  Tribunal
    was deciding whether as a matter of fact this gentleman would elect  to
    return to Pakistan with his son.  It was an error of law to  omit  them
    from the reasoning process.




    Disposal

10. The material facts identified by the Secretary of State's  ground  (ii)
    are  not  determinative.  Notwithstanding  that  Mr  Bashire's   father
    receives a great deal of support and comfort from living in the  United
    Kingdom, his country of nationality, it is still entirely possible that
    he would as a matter of fact leave it all behind to stay with his  son.
    In her submissions Ms Mensah took me to various points in the evidence,
    in particular the report of Consultant Psychiatrist  Dr  Haroon  Moosa,
    capable of indicating that his emotional dependency  is  such  that  he
    would in fact elect to do so. That report requires careful  evaluation,
    in line with the totality of the evidence and the  factors  highlighted
    by Ayinde and Thinjom's case.   I therefore find that in light  of  the
    extensive findings of fact required, that the  most  suitable  disposal
    would be that this matter is re-heard in the First-tier Tribunal.



    Decisions


11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  is  flawed  for  material
    error of law and it is set aside.


12. The decision in the appeal is to be  re-determined  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.


13. There is no order for anonymity.
