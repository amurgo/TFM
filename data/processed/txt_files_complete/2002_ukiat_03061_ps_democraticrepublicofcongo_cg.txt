                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. This is an appeal by Pitshou Ekenga Sasi, a citizen of the  Democratic
      Republic of Congo (DRC), against the determination of  an  Adjudicator
      (Mr J H Bryan) who  dismissed  his  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
      decision made on 16 August 2001  giving  directions  for  his  removal
      following the refusal of his claim for asylum.

   2. The Appellant claims to have entered the  United  Kingdom  on  1  June
      1999, using false documents.  He claimed asylum on 8  June  1999.   He
      says that he left the DRC on 18 December 1998, crossing the  river  to
      the Republic of Congo, where he stayed until 31 May 1999, spending all
      but a few days in the port of Pointe Noire.  He then travelled to  the
      United Kingdom with a 30 minute transit stop in France.

   3. The Appellant based his claim for asylum  on  a  fear  of  persecution
      because of his perceived political opinion and his ethnic origins.  He
      maintained that his father was Rwandan, but had grown up  in  Kinshasa
      and as a result, had acquired  DRC  nationality.   He  said  that  his
      problems started following the overthrow of the Mobutu regime in which
      Kabila was assisted by Rwandan soldiers.   After  he  came  to  power,
      President Kabila ordered the Rwandan soldiers to return home, but many
      refused and a rebel faction was  formed.   After  the  rebels  entered
      Kinshasa, the appellant's father was accused by the DRC authorities of
      assisting, or being a spy for, the rebels.  In September 1998, he  and
      his family were subjected to harassment.  His father  was  killed  and
      the Appellant was detained for a further  2�  months  and  mistreated.
      His release was obtained because  his  mother  managed  to  bribe  the
      guards.  He travelled with his mother first to Kourka, but when he was
      advised by relatives that it was unsafe for him to remain in the  DRC,
      he left for Congo Brazzaville.

   4. His claim for asylum was refused by the Secretary  of  State  for  the
      reasons set out in his decision  letter  dated  9  August  2001.   The
      Appellant appealed on both asylum and human  rights  grounds  and  his
      appeal  was  heard  by  the  Adjudicator  on  2  January  2002.    The
      Adjudicator heard oral evidence, both from the Appellant  and  from  a
      witness, Ndombasi Luntadila.  In the  Appellant's  oral  evidence,  he
      described the death of his father  in  1998.   Following  the  fallout
      between Kabila's supporters and his  former  allies  from  Rwanda  and
      Uganda, there was a call to persecute people  living  in  the  western
      part of the country who were ethnic Tutsi Rwandans.   His  father  was
      suspected by the regime of being a spy for the rebel forces.   He  was
      taken from his home, publicly burnt to death by having tyres  fastened
      over his body which were then ignited.  The Appellant  witnessed  this
      spectacle when he was returning home.  He sought to  remonstrate  with
      his father's assailants.  In doing so, he was knocked  to  the  ground
      unconscious.  When he came round, he found that he had been  arrested.
      He was detained for approximately 2� months before  being  transferred
      to a military hospital in camp Kokolo where he remained from 8  to  19
      December 1998.

   5. The Appellant is recorded as having told the Adjudicator that  he  did
      not fear persecution by virtue of being half-Tutsi because he did  not
      look like his father, but rather he looked Congolese like his  mother.
      He did not believe that his father had been arrested and killed simply
      because he came  from  Rwanda,  but  rather  because  the  authorities
      believed him, incorrectly, to have been an  enemy  agent.   He  feared
      that he would be re-arrested and imprisoned were he  returned  to  the
      DRC.  He would be subjected to  human  rights  violations  of  a  very
      serious kind.

   6. Having reviewed the evidence, the Adjudicator was satisfied  that  the
      Appellant had given a credible account of what had  happened  both  to
      his father and to himself.  He accepted that the  Appellant  had  been
      through the appalling trauma of seeing his father burnt  to  death  by
      security forces in the DRC.  It was the Adjudicator's  view  that  the
      evidence against the Appellant's father was trumped up  and  that  his
      arrest and death were brought about on the tide of  xenophobia  raging
      in Kinshasa at a time when the rebel forces were very close to  taking
      the city.  The Adjudicator was also satisfied that the  Appellant  was
      likely  to  have  been  tortured,  maltreated  and  kept  in   inhuman
      surroundings whilst in detention.  He found that the Appellant had not
      been arrested because of any political  opinions  or  because  of  his
      ethnicity, but because he was enraged by the treatment of his  father.
      He did not believe that  the  Appellant  had  been  interrogated,  but
      considered that he had been detained purely as a  punishment  for  his
      actions on the day his  father  was  killed.   He  accepted  that  the
      Appellant had a subjective fear of persecution and that at the time it
      had been well founded.  He had been able to  find  security  in  Congo
      Brazzaville.

   7. The Adjudicator went on to consider whether the Appellant would have a
      well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason were  he  now
      to return to the  DRC.   He  noted  that  in  his  evidence  that  the
      Appellant had produced two arrest warrants, but  the  Adjudicator  was
      not satisfied that they were genuine.  For the reasons which he  gives
      in paragraph 27, he felt that it  was  "less  than  likely"  that  the
      documents were  genuine.   He  found  that,  as  the  authorities  had
      released the Appellant in December 1998 on payment of  a  bribe,  this
      indicated that they could not have had a serious  continuing  interest
      in him.  He felt that with the passage of time it became  less  likely
      that he ran the risk of any further enquiries being  made.   He  noted
      that the Appellant's family had been able to settle in another  suburb
      in Kinshasa.  The Adjudicator's view was that the Appellant would  not
      be in danger of arrest should he  be  returned.   He  found  that  the
      Appellant was unable to show a  continuing  fear  of  persecution  and
      that, in any event, he would be unable to show that  his  fears  arose
      for a Convention reason.  He  dismissed  both  the  asylum  and  human
      rights appeals.

   8. In substance, the grounds of appeal assert that, in the light  of  the
      Adjudicator's findings of fact, it followed that the  Appellant  would
      be at risk of persecution on return.  The risk to  the  Appellant  was
      that he would be seen by the authorities as the  son  of  a  suspected
      Tutsi spy, who himself had been arrested, detained and tortured as  an
      anti-Kabila man.  Leave to appeal was granted by the  Tribunal  (Mr  J
      Barnes, Vice President) in a determination notified on 11 March  2002,
      on the basis that it was arguable that the Adjudicator had  not  given
      adequate consideration to the risks faced by those of Tutsi origin.

   9. At the hearing before the Tribunal, Mr Gunasekara adopted the  grounds
      of appeal.  He referred to the background evidence and  in  particular
      to 1A18 at page 183 referring to the call for  the  slaughter  of  the
      Tutsis in August 1998.  He referred  to  the  letter  from  the  UNHCR
      (2A10, 51-2) which referred to the overall security situation  in  the
      DRC being volatile and the fact that people  of  Tutsi  ethnic  origin
      were known to be among the targets of extreme human rights  abuses  in
      DRC amounting to persecution.   It  reports  that  Tutsis,  and  those
      perceived to be Tutsis, have been subjected to arbitrary detention and
      ill-treatment and in certain instances  have  been  tracked  down  and
      killed in Kinshasa.

  10. Mr  Deller  drew  the  Tribunal's  attention  to  the  fact  that  the
      Adjudicator had recorded that the Appellant had not expressed  a  fear
      of  persecution  by  virtue  of  being   half-Tutsi.    However,   the
      Adjudicator had accepted that at the time the Appellant left, he had a
      fear of persecution.  It must be for the Tribunal to  assess,  in  the
      light of the background evidence, whether the Appellant could properly
      be regarded as still having a well-founded fear of persecution  for  a
      Convention reason or being at risk of  such  severe  treatment  as  to
      engage the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 3.

  11. The Adjudicator believed the Appellant's account of what had  happened
      to him and his father in the DRC and his account of  his  reasons  for
      leaving.  It is clear from the background  evidence  what  a  troubled
      country the DRC is.  According to the US State Department Report 2001,
      government forces continue to control less than half of  the  country.
      Various rebel groups control the remaining territory with  the  active
      support of the Rwandan and  Ugandan  governments.   The  human  rights
      situation in both government and rebel held areas is poor.   There  is
      clear evidence that in government controlled  areas,  those  of  Tutsi
      ethnic origin have been subjected to extreme violence and persecution.
       It is recorded that the government no  longer  follows  a  policy  of
      arresting and detaining members of  the  Tutsi  ethnic  group  without
      charge  merely on the basis of  their  ethnicity.   However,  it  also
      reported that about 30  Tutsis  arrested  in  1998  have  remained  in
      detention in Makala prison at the end  of  2000,  largely  because  of
      their ethnicity.  In the letter from the UNHCR (2A10), it is  reported
      that persons of Tutsi ethnic origin are known to  be  the  targets  of
      extreme human rights  abuses  because  Rwandan  supported  forces  are
      prominent  among  the  armed  elements  ranged  against  the  Kinshasa
      authorities.

  12. In his oral evidence, the Appellant attributed the death of his father
      to the fact that he was suspected by the regime of being a spy for the
      rebel forces.   The  Tribunal  find  it  impossible  to  discount  the
      likelihood that the fact that he was a Tutsi, who had originally  come
      from Rwanda  would  have  played  a  large  part  in  generating  this
      suspicion.  The hostility of the Kabila regime towards Tutsis  is  all
      too clear from the report in The Times dated 14 August  1998  (1A183).
      The Appellant's father  was  killed  in  the  response  to  government
      broadcasts which, according  to  the  report  in  The  Times,  were  a
      chilling echo of broadcasts that inspired the genocide of one  million
      Tutsis in Rwanda four years previously.

  13. The Tribunal have come to the view that, in  the  light  of  what  has
      happened in the past, we feel very  uncertain  about  the  Appellant's
      safety were he now to return to the DRC.  He is the son of a Tutsi who
      was murdered because of his perceived support  for  the  rebels.   The
      Appellant may only be half-Tutsi and according to him, looks Congolese
      like his mother, but the fact remains that he is the son  of  a  Tutsi
      father.  In the light of the reports about continuing violence towards
      Tutsis, the Tribunal have  very  real  doubts  about  the  Appellant's
      safety were he now to return to the DRC.  It follows that there  must,
      at least, be a serious possibility or a real risk  of  persecution  or
      severe ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 were he now to be  returned
      to the DRC.

  14. In these circumstances, it follows that this appeal must be allowed.
