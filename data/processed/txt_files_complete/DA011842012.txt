Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Hawkin, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Kenya born on 13 June 1988.   His  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision to deport him  under  Section
    32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 was allowed under  Article  8  of  the
    ECHR  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Easterman  and  Dr  T  Okitikpi.
    Although the appellant is effectively the respondent in this appeal,  I
    shall keep the designations as they are for ease of reference.

2.   The respondent was granted permission to appeal  the  panel's  decision
    by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Garratt.   Firstly,  he  said  that  the
    Secretary of State's application was received  two  days  out  of  time
    without reasons given for the lateness.  However, having regard to  the
    merits of part of the application and the short period of lateness,  he
    was satisfied that there were special circumstances which would  render
    it unjust not to extend time and did so.

3.   In the respondent's notice/skeleton argument submitted  by  Mr  Hawkin,
    he raised the issue as to the effectiveness of the grant of  permission
    to appeal, and therefore as to the jurisdiction of the  Upper  Tribunal
    to hear this appeal at all.  He argued that as there was no explanation
    and no application to extend time, it was not appropriate  or  open  to
    the judge to have regard to the merits of the  application,  and  quite
    impossible to be satisfied that there were "special circumstances which
    would render it unjust not to  extend  time".   Such  an  approach  ran
    entirely counter to the Upper Tribunal's consistent recognition of  the
    importance of time limits.  Mr Hawkin relied on Boktor and Wanis  (late
    application for permission) Egypt [2011] UKUT  00442  (IAC)  and  Samir
    (FtT permission to appeal: time) [2013] UKUT 0003 (IAC).

4.   It was  not  in  dispute  that  the  determination  of  the  panel  was
    promulgated  on  21  March  2013.   Mr  Melvin   submitted   that   the
    determination reached the Presenting Officer's team on  22  March.   He
    showed me a copy of the application which was sent by fax to the IAC on
    28 March.  According to the notice of receipt sent to all  the  parties
    by the IAC, the application was received in  Loughborough  on  2  April
    2013.

5.   Paragraph 24 of The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
    2005 stipulates that an application for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal must be sent or delivered to the Tribunal so that it  is
    received no later than 5 days after the date on which the party  making
    the application is deemed to have been served with written reasons  for
    the decision.  As the Home Office Presenting  Officer's  Unit  received
    the  determination  on  22  March,  the  fifth  day  for  lodging   the
    application would have been 2 April because of the  intervening  Easter
    holidays.  On the evidence before me I find that the  application  made
    by the Secretary of State on 28 March was in time.

6.   The other grounds of appeal submitted by  the  respondent  argued  that
    the panel failed to give adequate  reasons  for  their  findings  under
    Article 8 and that the panel misdirected itself in law by following the
    approach recommended by the Upper Tribunal  in  MF  (Article  8  -  new
    Rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC).   The  panel  should  not  have
    simply regarded the Rules as a starting point before  moving  on  to  a
    second freestanding Article 8 assessment.  The panel failed to consider
    any independent reports  on  the  appellant  that  might  indicate  the
    likelihood of reoffending  before  reaching  the  conclusion  that  the
    appellant was not at future risk of offending.

7.   First-tier Judge Garratt made the comment  that  the  determination  of
    the panel made no reference to the application of the  new  Immigration
    Rules although he inferred that this was because the panel applied part
    of guidance set in MF and proceeded to consider  the  Article  8  claim
    under existing case law without reference to the new Rules. However  it
    was arguable that the panel's approach was flawed in that it failed, in
    its consideration of Article 8 outside the Rules, to be informed by the
    greater specificity  which  those  Rules  give  to  the  important  the
    Secretary of State attaches to the public interest.  This  approach  is
    summarised in sub-paragraph (viii) of the head note to MF.   Further it
    is arguable that the panel  did  not  give  adequate  consideration  to
    Article 8 issues taking into consideration the future risk of offending
    by the appellant  after  showing  that  they  had  considered  all  the
    evidence relevant to their conclusion.  It is arguable that  the  panel
    should have  shown  that  it  had  followed  the  five  stage  approach
    recommended in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  before  reaching  its  Article  8
    conclusions.

8.   Mr Melvin argued that the new Immigration Rules  on  Article  8  should
    have been the starting point for the panel as found in  MF  and  Azuazu
    [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC).  The determination does not make mention  of  the
    new Rules at all.  His core argument  was  that  the  panel  failed  to
    address the new Immigration Rules and to consider  whether  there  were
    exceptional compassionate circumstances in this case or  whether  there
    were insurmountable obstacles  should  the  appellant  be  deported  to
    Kenya.  This means that the panel ignored the two stage approach,  that
    is, considering the appellant's appeal under Article 8 of the new Rules
    and if the appellant failed under the new Rules then there would be  no
    need to look at the second stage which would be considering  Article  8
    under the Razgar principles.

9.   After hearing Mr Hawkin's  submissions,  I  agreed  with  him  that  Mr
    Melvin's arguments ran counter to the way the case  was  argued  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  I also found that his argument ran counter to
    ground one of the grounds submitted with the application for permission
    to appeal, which said that the panel had applied a two  stage  test  in
    the Article 8 assessment and in doing so had misdirected itself in law.
     Yet, Mr Melvin was arguing that the Tribunal failed to apply  the  two
    stage test and in so  doing  misdirected  itself  in  law.   There  was
    confusion in the  respondent's  line  of  argument.   The  respondent's
    argument did not amount to an error of law.

10.  At paragraph 9 of the determination it is  recorded  that  "neither  of
    the parties suggested that the appellant could meet the requirements of
    private or family life under the changes in the Immigration Rules  that
    apply to the appellant and as a result  the  claim  rests  entirely  on
    Article 8."  In light of this agreement it is  not  arguable  that  the
    panel failed in their duty  to  consider  the  new  Immigration  Rules.
    Having agreed that the appellant could  not  succeed  under  those  new
    Rules, there was no need for the panel to consider the new  Immigration
    Rules simply for the purpose of carrying out their duty.


11.  I also agree with Mr Hawkin that it was difficult to see how the  panel
    could  have  reached  a  materially  different  conclusion  merely   by
    considering whether the factors they relied on amounted to  exceptional
    circumstances under the Immigration Rules.  The panel would still  have
    gone on to consider the appeal under Article 8 outside the Rules in any
    event if they considered that the appellant would not succeed under the
    new Immigration Rules.

12.  I find that  the  respondent's  remaining  grounds  of  appeal  do  not
    disclose a material error of law in the panel's decision.

13.  The panel considered the nature of the appellant's offending.   He  was
    employed as a financial assistant being paid �25,000 a year.  He became
    addicted to what is described as spread  betting  and  what  the  panel
    described as speculative trading on the internet.   Over  a  period  of
    three months he took money by falsifying details on invoices,  so  that
    money that should have been paid to suppliers, was actually paid to his
    own bank account with the consequence that he  lost  the  company  some
    �92,000.  The panel considered the sentencing judge's remark  that  the
    offences were completely out of character and that  the  appellant  was
    highly educated, came from a good family  and  knew  that  he  had  let
    himself and his family down.  It was clear that the offending had had a
    great deal of effect on all  the  family.   The  judge  would  use  the
    sentence from the starting point of 30 months to fifteen  months  which
    was a significant reduction.

14.  I find that at paragraph 53 the  panel  correctly  directed  itself  in
    stating that it is only because of this offending that the appellant is
    considered a foreign criminal  and  in  need  of  removal.   They  took
    account of the general proposition that where a person is sentenced  to
    more than one year the Secretary of  State  is  bound  to  deport  them
    unless they can bring themselves within one  of  the  exceptions.   The
    panel started their deliberations  from  the  point  that  having  been
    sentenced to more than one year the appellant should be  deported  from
    the United Kingdom.  It  is  clear  from  this  paragraph  and  to  the
    preceding  paragraphs  that  the  panel  had  the  public  interest  in
    deportation firmly in mind.

15.  The panel balanced the appellant's article 8 rights against the  public
    interest in deportation.  They heard live evidence from the  appellant,
    his father, mother, sister and brother.  For the  reasons  set  out  at
    length in paragraphs 54 to 58 the panel found that the public  interest
    was outweighed in the appellant's case.  The panel were convinced  that
    the appellant was indeed very remorseful for what he had done, not just
    because he was going to be or may well be deported, but because he  was
    ashamed of his actions and the stigma that his actions have brought  on
    himself and his family.  They believed that he  will  try  to  seek  to
    repay  the  money  that  he  has  stolen.   The  panel  looked  at  the
    appellant's family's circumstances  and  found  that  the  private  and
    family life he has been built up whilst he was in the UK, in particular
    the family life is such that it would not be  proportionate  to  deport
    him.

16.  The grounds further submitted that the appellant has been convicted  of
    a pre-panned, sophisticated crime with no evidence that he has  tackled
    the gambling addiction that led to the  offence.   Mr.  Hawkin  in  his
    skeleton argument said that it was clear  from  the  evidence  of  that
    appellant that he had sought assistance  from  the  probation  service,
    though they had not yet responded.  Most importantly, the appellant  in
    his oral evidence had said that had  whilst  in  prison  trained  as  a
    barber, which is work that keeps him away from excessive  time  on  the
    computer, which was what led him  to  start  the  speculative  trading.
    There was also a lot of evidence about the appellant's plans  aided  by
    his parents to start a barber's shop with  his  father  having  already
    identified a possible shop for him and his father to start the business
    in.  It appears to me that all this evidence was accepted by the panel.

17.  A further argument developed by  the  respondent  was  that  the  panel
    failed to consider any independent reports on the  appellant  that  may
    indicate the likelihood of  reoffending.   However,  as  stated  by  Mr
    Hawkin in his skeleton argument neither  the  prison  service  nor  the
    probation service have produced any reports on the appellant's risk  of
    reoffending and the  Tribunal  itself  had  considered  the  issue  and
    concluded after hearing the evidence of the appellant  and  his  family
    members that he was not at future risk of reoffending.

18.  In the light of the above, I find that the panel made no error  of  law
    in its decision.

19.  The panel's decision allowing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
