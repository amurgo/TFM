Appellant:    Mr C Ndubuisi of Drummond Miller LLP, Edinburgh
Respondent:   Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The background is set out fully in the Tribunal's error of law decision
    promulgated on 08  September  2014,  which  is  appended  hereto.   The
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT"), which has been set  aside,
    is hereby remade.

 2. The grounds of and reasons for the Secretary of State's refusal of  the
    Applicant's application are rehearsed  in  [3]  of  the  error  of  law
    determination. The Secretary of  State's  response  to  the  Tribunal's
    earlier directions resulted in two of the reasons, namely (b) and  (h),
    being withdrawn.  This exercise had the further  merit  of  telescoping
    the basis of the Secretary of State's refusal, in the following terms:

         "The SSHD maintains that the  Appellant  has  not  shown  that  his
         business proposal is any more than disguised employment."

    The further hearing before the Tribunal unfolded accordingly.

 3. Evidence was given by the Appellant, his brother resident  and  settled
    in Scotland and his brother's spouse (the Appellant's sister  in  law).
    The cross examination of the Appellant,  in  tandem  with  the  closing
    submissions, focused attention on the following  areas  of  concern  in
    particular: the reference to "accountant" in  the  Appellant's  witness
    statement; the identity of the person who prepared the  business  plan;
    the Appellant's hours of work and income; the  circumstances  in  which
    the business was established and has evolved; the  involvement  of  his
    brother's mother in law in the business lease; the  provenance  of  the
    funds required to establish  the  business  and  the  identity  of  any
    funder; whether any savings accumulated by  the  Appellant  during  his
    sojourn in Kuwait were invested in the business; and the role, if  any,
    of another brother in Turkey.

 4. In the error of law determination the issue relating to the  lease  has
    already been considered in some depth.   The  other  issues  summarised
    above were explored in cross examination of  the  Appellant.  This  was
    linked to  various  parts  of  the  moderately  voluminous  documentary
    evidence, in particular bank transfers  from  Kuwait  to  Turkey,  bank
    transfers  from  Turkey  to  the  United  Kingdom  and   various   bank
    statements.  The evidence also included a written communication, in the
    form of a witness statement, from  the  brother  in  Turkey.   We  have
    considered all of this evidence in the round.  Further, we have had the
    benefit of evaluating the demeanour of the Appellant and the other  two
    witnesses who testified.  The fundamental issue is whether there is any
    sustainable basis  for  questioning  the  Appellant's  bona  fides  and
    disbelieving the case made by him.  Is there a concealed funder  and/or
    business proprietor other than  the  Appellant?   To  this  fundamental
    question we supply a negative answer.  Bearing in mind that the onus of
    proof is on the Appellant and the civil  standard  of  the  balance  of
    probabilities applies, we are  entirely  satisfied  that  none  of  the
    Secretary  of  State's  reasons  for  refusal  of  the  application  is
    sustained.  The Appellant's bona fides have  been  established  to  our
    satisfaction.

 5. It is appropriate to compliment the Appellant's solicitors on the  high
    standard of  the  bundles  prepared  for  this  hearing.   They  are  a
    reflection of industry and expertise, coupled with an  appreciation  of
    what is required in the  interests  of  an  efficient  and  expeditious
    hearing.

DECISION

 6. We remake the decision of the FtT by allowing the Appellant's appeal.

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

Introduction

 1. This appeal originates in a decision made on behalf of the Secretary of
    State  for  the  Home  Department,  the  Respondent  herein,  dated  23
    September 2013, whereby the application of  the  Appellant,  a  Turkish
    national,  for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under  the
    provisions of the Turkey -  European  Community  Association  Agreement
    (sometimes described as  the  "Ankara  Agreement")  was  refused.   The
    Appellant's ensuing appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (the  "FtT")  was
    dismissed.

The Impugned Decision

 2. The Appellant, seeking to avail of the Agreement, based his application
    for leave to remain on a proposal, contained in a business  plan,  that
    he would establish/continue a  barber's  business  in  Edinburgh.   His
    application engaged paragraph 21 of HC510  (the  Immigration  Rules  of
    1973).  Two of the main themes of paragraph 21 are  that  the  business
    proposal must be both genuine and viable.  This provision of the  Rules
    was considered by the Upper Tribunal in Akinci [2012] UKUT  266,  which
    held that the following is the correct approach to paragraph 21:

      i. The price for acquisition of  a  business  should  make  commercial
         sense. An exaggerated price or one which does not  reflect  in  any
         way the true value of the business may lead to a legitimate enquiry
         as to the truth  of  the  transaction  or  the  intentions  of  the
         parties.

     ii. A business plan must be realistic having regard to  the  nature  of
         the enterprise. It is legitimate to ask further questions where the
         projected turnover is substantially greater than that reflected  in
         the accounts of the business being acquired.

    iii. Even where a business is not expected to be profitable in the short
         term, revenue generated may well  be  enough  to  meet  short  term
         liabilities and provide enough for the applicant's support.

     iv. It is important therefore to identify the  likely  liabilities  and
         what the applicant's personal needs are in order to see if they can
         be met out of cash flow or the initial investment. The test is  not
         whether the applicant is going to get a return  on  his  investment
         but whether what is projected is likely to enable the applicant  to
         pay the bills arising and meet his living expenses.

      v. A plan is what it says it is: a projection of how it is anticipated
         things will work out with the possibility of making adjustments  as
         the business gets under way. It is not a strait jacket.

     vi. In doubtful cases an  applicant's  previous  experience  will  help
         inform the decision- maker whether a projected turnover  is  likely
         to be achieved, but such experience is not a pre-requisite.

 3.  The  Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the  Appellant's  application
    reasoned as follows:

      a) The Appellant's business proposal  failed  to  detail  any  of  his
         competitors or how he would be able to deal with competition.

      b) The suggestion in the business plan that the  Appellant's  business
         would offer significantly better value for money than those of  his
         competitors was not supported by market research.

      c) The claim that the business would make a profit of ï¿½60,000  in  the
         first year was undermined by the absence of a pricing structure.

      d) In the absence of a Master Craftsman's Certificate, it would not be
         possible for the Appellant to trade as a barber in  Turkey,  giving
         rise to the conclusion that  he   did  not  possess  the  requisite
         skills.

      e) The Appellant's claim that he had  operated  a  barber's  salon  in
         Kuwait from 2001  to  2012  was  significantly  undermined  by  the
         absence of any supporting documentary evidence.

      f) His application was further undermined by the absence  of  evidence
         that he had invested any personal funds  in  the  purchase  of  the
         business.

      g) Furthermore, there were no bank  statements  in  his  name  and  no
         evidence that he had registered with the relevant  Council  to  pay
         business rates.

      h) The Appellant had failed to explain why  he  had  remained  in  the
         United Kingdom beyond the two week period specified  in  his  entry
         clearance application form.

 4. Given the contours of  the  appeal  to  this  Tribunal,  there  is  one
    particular passage in the refusal decision which  invites  reproduction
    in full:

         "You have failed  to  provide  any  lease,  sub-lease,  or  licence
         agreement for the premises, which names you as the business  owner.
         You are in fact not named at all on any documents provided relating
         to  the  ownership  of  [the  relevant  property].   The  sub-lease
         agreement provided is between [AK] and [MV] with the  landlords  of
         the premises established as [three other named persons].  I am  not
         therefore satisfied you have established that  you  currently  hold
         any ownership of the business."

    We shall return to this issue at a later stage of this judgment.

Decision of the FtT

 5. The key passage in the decision of the FtT is in [9].  In  the  context
    of rehearsing the submissions of the Appellant's legal  representative,
    the Judge states:

         "... I pressed him on a matter arising from  the  evidence  of  the
         brother of the Appellant.  In particular in his evidence he  stated
         that the sub-lease for the business premises had been taken in  the
         name of his mother- in- law as if the sub-lease had been  taken  in
         his name he would have been liable for increased business rates  on
         another property he owned.  I asked this witness if his mother- in-
         law had any interest  in  the  business  in  question  ...  and  he
         confirmed that she did not.  I was very concerned about  this.   If
         the business was truly that of the Appellant, it was  difficult  to
         see why the sub-lease did not run in his name ...

         It seemed to me  that  this  witness  had  given  evidence  that  a
         business arrangement had been entered into  the  terms  [of]  which
         were designed to no simply avoid liability for rates otherwise due,
         but to evade liability for them.  It seemed to me that the  absence
         of the mother -  in-  law  having  any  interest  in  the  business
         whatsoever pointed to the view that there [was a] real  possibility
         of an attempt to avoid evasion  [sic]  of  rates  rather  than  the
         claimed reason of the landlord not being prepared to grant  a  sub-
         lease to the Appellant because of his immigration status."

    Developing this theme with some gusto, the Judge continues:

         "[The  Appellant's  legal  representative]  did   not   appear   to
         understand that in  effect  the  witness  from  whom  he  led  this
         evidence was potentially incriminating himself in the commission of
         a fraud ..."

    In a later passage in the judgment,  the  Judge's  omnibus  reason  for
    dismissing the appeal is expressed thus:

         "I did not consider that there was sufficient credible or  reliable
         evidence before me  to  allow  me  to  conclude  on  a  balance  of
         probability  that  the  Appellant  has  established  himself  in  a
         business such that he could rely on the Standstill Agreement."

    Next, addressing another aspect of  the  sub-lease  issue,  the  Judge,
    while not disbelieving the Appellant's claim that  the  landlord  would
    transfer the head lease to him following  a  sub-lease  period  of  two
    years, was plainly unimpressed by the absence of any written  agreement
    embodying  this  arrangement.   In  further   passages,   the   Judge's
    reservations about the parties to the sub-lease are re-emphasised.  The
    Judge repeats his view that the sub-lease scheme was designed "to evade
    payment of rates that might be otherwise due", expressing this  as  his
    reason for questioning the honesty of  the  Appellant's  brother.   The
    Judge also describes the evidence of the Appellant's mother - in -  law
    as "unsatisfactory" and highlights a letter written by the  Appellant's
    mother - in - law in which it is suggested that she became a  party  to
    the sub-lease because the  Appellant,  by  virtue  of  his  immigration
    status, was precluded from doing so.  The Judge, without particulars or
    elaboration, states that this "was different from the reason  given  to
    me".  If one links this passage, in [34], with [28] in particular,  the
    "reason" to which the Judge is here alluding seems to be "to  suit  the
    business rates position of the  brother  of  the  Appellant".   In  the
    concluding passage, the Judge dismisses the  appeal  in  the  following
    terms:

         "I am far from satisfied that the Appellant has shown on a  balance
         of probabilities that this is his business.  There appeared  to  me
         to be too many difficulties with the evidence of the  witnesses  in
         this case and the documentation  produced  such  that  I  could  be
         satisfied that on balance that if the Appellant does work on  these
         premises as a barber, he does so in his capacity as owner  of  that
         business.  There are significant credibility issues  in  this  case
         and the appeal is dismissed."

Our Conclusions

 6. We have, in the foregoing paragraphs, drawn attention  to  the  central
    issues thrown up by the Appellant's application for  leave  to  remain,
    the grounds upon which this was  refused  by  the  Respondent  and  the
    reasons expressed by the FtT for dismissing the resulting  appeal.   At
    the conclusion of the hearing, we  gave  judgment.   Our  decision  was
    that, fundamentally, the FtT had misunderstood the evidence relating to
    the sub-lease arrangement.  We have some sympathy with the Judge, given
    that this was a moderately complex arrangement involving a multiplicity
    of   parties.    Ultimately,   this   judicial   misunderstanding   was
    acknowledged by the Respondent's representative.  A failure to properly
    comprehend evidence bearing on an important issue amounts to  an  error
    of law.  The materiality  of  the  error  in  this  context  is  beyond
    plausible dispute, given that it sounded on one of the refusal reasons,
    it related to what the Judge considered an issue of some magnitude  and
    it plainly infected other adverse assessments and findings expressed in
    the FtT's decision and its overarching conclusion.

 7. We further conclude that the FtT erred in law in its  discrete  finding
    that the sub-lease arrangement was  designed  to  illicitly  evade  the
    payment of rates for the business premises.  Once the  intricacies  of,
    and plainly acceptable explanation for, the head  lease  and  sub-lease
    arrangements are fully appreciated, the evidence does not sustain  this
    finding.   This  too  was,  ultimately,  conceded  on  behalf  of   the
    Respondent. Finally, it was accepted on behalf of the  Respondent  that
    the Appellant is by occupation a barber.

Decision

 8. For the reasons given at the conclusion of the hearing  and  elaborated
    above, we set aside the decision of the FtT.

                                   DIRECTIONS

 9. We make the following directions:

      a) The appeal will be retained in the Upper Tribunal for  the  purpose
         of remaking the decision.

      b) This panel will conduct the rehearing on 08 December  2014  at  the
         same venue.

      c) The Respondent will, within 21 days of the date  hereof,  state  in
         writing, with particular reference to the 'menu' in [3] above:

         (i)  Which issues are conceded.

         (ii) Which issues remain in dispute.

      d) The Respondent will also, within the same time limit, set  out  its
         proposals  for  the  preservation  of   findings   in   the   FtT's
         determination.

      e) The Appellant's representative will respond in writing to  (c)  and
         (d) above within a further period of 21 days.

      f) The Appellant's representative will ensure that two copies  of  the
         Appellant's bundle/s, fully indexed and  paginated,  are  available
         for the panel Judges by 01 December 2014 at latest.

      g) The remaking of the appeal will be listed as a half day hearing.
