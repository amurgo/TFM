Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Ball
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Albania.  It is not in issue that he  was
    born on  17  February  1996.   He  appealed  against  the  respondent's
    decision dated 29 November 2013 refusing  to  grant  him  asylum  under
    paragraph 336 of the Immigration Rules.  His appeal came before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Turquet.  By a determination dated February 11 2014
    the judge dismissed the appeal on all grounds.   The  appellant  sought
    permission to appeal that decision.  The  grounds  in  support  of  the
    application were settled by Counsel who appeared for the  appellant  in
    the First-tier and they are dated 27 February 2014.

 2. The grounds  of  appeal  submit  that  the  judge  flagged  up  various
    "inconsistencies" on the part of the appellant in interview but  failed
    to properly or adequately take into account that the  asylum  interview
    was  conducted  in  a  wholly  inappropriate  manner.   There  was   no
    appropriate adult present and the interview  lasted  over  three  hours
    with only two short breaks when best practice indicates (the need  for)
    regular breaks.  The appellant often indicated difficulty understanding
    the questions (examples given) and none of this was properly taken into
    account when  the  Judge  purported  to  find  against  the  appellant.
    Furthermore, the judge did not anxiously scrutinise  the  circumstances
    leading  to  the  blood  feud  against  the  appellant's  family.   The
    respondent accepted that a man called Sulejman Sala  had  been  knocked
    down and killed by a bus, but that the only article the respondent  had
    been able to locate on the internet did not name the driver of the bus.
     Research on the internet by the appellant's representatives  found  an
    article indicating that a man by the name of Agron Rizahi had been  the
    driver of a bus that knocked over and killed a Suleiman Sala  and  that
    the employer of Mr Rizahi, a company called Beam Travel, indicated that
    he did work for the company, was involved in the accident  in  question
    and was the subject of a blood feud.

 3. Although giving no reasons the  judge  granting  permission  to  appeal
    stated that the grounds disclosed an arguable error of law.

The Rule 24 Response

 4. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response by letter dated 31 March  2014.
    It is  said  that  it  is  clear  from  paragraph  39  of  the  judge's
    determination that she was careful to establish that there had been  no
    unfairness in the conduct of the appellant's interview and that she was
    prepared to take account of the appellant's age  when  considering  his
    ability to answer questions.  The determination had to  be  read  as  a
    whole.  The judge stated clearly at paragraph  9  that  she  had  taken
    account of all evidence, including  documentation  from  Albania.   Her
    findings show  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  evidence  leading  to
    properly reasoned conclusions.

 5. I have before me all the documentation that was before  the  First-tier
    Judge.  This includes the respondent's bundle,  an  appellant's  bundle
    which is in effect unpaginated, the joint Presidential Guidance Note No
    2 of 2010 and case law including R v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department on the application of AN (a child) and FA (a  child)  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 1636 and JA (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2014] EWCA Civ 450.



Submissions

 6. Mr Ball, representing the appellant, submitted  that  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note was an important consideration that needed  to  be  taken
    into account by the judge.  Although  it  was  issued  in  relation  to
    substantive hearings before judges, set out within  it  at  5.2iii  are
    examples of a responsible adult, e.g. parent,  social  worker,  teacher
    and foster parent who will be  attending  the  substantive  hearing  to
    provide support.   A legal  representative  is  not  and  cannot  be  a
    responsible adult.

 7. Mr Ball made the point that at the initial  screening  interview  there
    was no responsible adult in attendance.  The only persons present  were
    the interviewing officer, the interpreter and the appellant.   Mr  Ball
    made reference to paragraphs 124-126 of AN which I  set  out  hereafter
    where Lady Justice Black wrote:-

         "124.    Left  to  my  own  devices,  without  the  constraints  of
                existing rules and policy and without the benefit of  having
                seen in advance the judgment of my Lord, Lord Justice Elias,
                I would have  been  inclined  to  say  that  asylum  related
                answers given by any child in the absence of  a  responsible
                adult should not be relied upon at all in the evaluation  of
                his asylum claim. However, I have accepted that it  was  not
                unlawful to interview the children in the  circumstances  in
                which they were interviewed and I accept also that there  is
                nothing in statute or in the  Rules,  guidance  or  European
                directives which prohibits reliance on material obtained  as
                it was from AN.  As I have made clear, I have doubts  as  to
                the logic of the approach taken in the  UKBA's  policies  in
                relation to the interviewing of children and I consider that
                a rigid application of them risks producing an  outcome  for
                the individual  child  which  is  not  compatible  with  the
                requirement to have the interests of  the  child  a  primary
                consideration when making decisions about his future whilst,
                of course,  also  ensuring  effective  immigration  control.
                After considerable reflection, I  have  concluded,  however,
                that it would be going too far to say that my doubts  should
                be translated into a complete acceptance of  what  Elias  LJ
                has described as the appellants' 'root and branch attack' on
                the policies of the UKBA which would result in the Secretary
                of State and the Tribunal on appeal being prevented in every
                case, as a matter of  principle,  from  relying  on  answers
                given in the circumstances in which AN's answers were given.



         125. My final conclusion is that Mitting J was right  to  say  that
                the influence of such answers should be regulated by  weight
                in  the  particular  case  rather  than  by  any   universal
                principle of admissibility.  Not  only  does  this  properly
                reflect the limits to which I am prepared to push my doubts,
                it is also largely consistent (as Elias LJ points out)  with
                the approach taken in section 78 of PACE which is to require
                a tailored  decision  as  to  admissibility  in  each  case.
                However, I hope that  any  decision  maker  considering  the
                issue of weight will have regard to what I  perceive  to  be
                the shortcomings of the present policies, to the  particular
                vulnerabilities of children in circumstances such  as  those
                of FA and AN, and to the real possibility that  difficulties
                created by interviewing them  without  a  responsible  adult
                present cannot be cured by providing an opportunity for  the
                child  to  explain  his  earlier  answers  either   in   the
                substantive interview or later in the process.  As Mitting J
                said, it may be right in an individual case to attribute  no
                weight at all to the material that emerged; in  that  event,
                the material should be treated as if it  had  been  excluded
                from the start.

         126. Where there has been a clear breach of the principles set  out
                in the various provisions governing questioning about asylum
                to which I have referred earlier in this judgment, it  ought
                at the very least to be exceedingly  difficult  to  persuade
                the court to admit material that has been thereby  obtained;
                some breaches will  inevitably  rule  out  reliance  on  the
                material as was the case with  FA's  answers  following  his
                indication that he was claiming asylum.  But decision makers
                will have to be  alert  to  the  possible  need  to  discard
                material even where matters have not gone that far."

 8. Mr Ball then made reference to the judgment in the same  case  of  Lord
    Justice Kay at paragraph 184:-

         "184.    I agree that answers given at the outset do not attract  a
                blanket prohibition on subsequent admissibility and that the
                issue is  one  of  weight,  which  will  require  scrupulous
                assessment.  As the  preceding  judgments  reveal,  once  an
                application for asylum has been intimated -  as  it  may  be
                spontaneously  -  the  applicant  has  the   protection   of
                paragraph  6.2  of  Processing  Asylum   Applications   from
                Children. This acknowledgement of the risk of the  potential
                unreliability of answers given at that stage  by  an  asylum
                seeking minor in the absence of a responsible adult or legal
                representative is a matter which ought properly to be  taken
                into account when considering what weight, if any, should be
                accorded to the answers of a minor who has not  yet  claimed
                asylum."

 9. Mr Ball submitted that the  determination  is  sorely  lacking  in  any
    scrupulous assessment. This is evidenced in paragraph 40 by  the  judge
    stating that she noted that in  the  appellant's  screening  interview,
    when asked why he was afraid something  bad  would  happen  to  him  on
    return, he responded that "They threatened us that they  are  going  to
    kill us".  The judge went on to say that the appellant did not  mention
    that he had already been attacked.  If he had been attacked as claimed,
    she found it reasonable for him to have said so at that  stage.   This,
    Mr Ball submitted, was where the judge fell into error in  making  that
    finding which was a bedrock one damaging the  appellant's  credibility.
    The judge at paragraph 39 refers to the weight that she attached to the
    interview, but appears to have attached full weight at paragraph 40  to
    finding against the appellant because he did not mention  that  he  had
    already been attacked.

10. Looking at the interview itself Mr Ball then  said  that  it  was  some
    three hours long and that there should have been a break at some stage.
     It was then pointed out to him that there had in fact been two  breaks
    during the interview and he accepted that that was so.  He went  on  to
    submit that there was clearly confusion in the  answers  given  to  the
    interviewing officer, for instance, at questions  98,  102,  125,  146,
    147, 187 and 190, which shows additional reasons  why  the  appellant's
    answers should have been treated with caution and circumspection.

11. Regarding the second ground, upon looking at page 27 of the appellant's
    bundle (section 2) Mr Ball submitted that there was clear evidence that
    it was the appellant's father who was driving the bus that resulted  in
    the death of Mr Sala.  It was clearly a key finding as to whether  this
    was  in  fact  what  happened  as  it  provided  the  reason  for   the
    commencement of the blood feud and was a matter that should  have  been
    addressed by the judge, but there is no evidence that  she  did  so  at
    all.  The judge  was  not  entitled  to  place  little  weight  on  the
    documentation produced as evidence  that  the  appellant's  father  was
    charged and sentenced as set out in paragraph 50 of the  determination.
    The judge was not entitled to conclude as she did in paragraph  4  that
    the  appellant  has  fabricated  events  to  bolster  his  claim.   The
    credibility findings are not safe and the matter should go back to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a complete rehearing.

12. In his submissions Mr Nath said that there had been  sufficient  breaks
    at  the  interview.   The  judge  was  entitled  to  make  findings  on
    credibility for the reasons that she gave in what was a  very  detailed
    determination and at paragraph 61, although finding that the  appellant
    had not been threatened by the Sala family, even if he had  been  there
    would nevertheless be sufficiency of protection for him in Albania  for
    the reasons that the judge sets out in the subsequent paragraphs.

My Decision

13. Paragraph 352 of the Immigration Rules states as follows:-

         "Any child over the age of 12 who has claimed  asylum  in  his  own
         right shall be interviewed about the substance of his claim  unless
         the child is unfit or unable to be interviewed.  When an  interview
         takes place it shall be conducted in  the  presence  of  a  parent,
         guardian,  representative  or  another  adult  independent  of  the
         Secretary of State who  has  responsibility  for  the  child.   The
         interviewer shall have specialist training in the  interviewing  of
         children and have particular regard to the possibility that a child
         will feel inhibited or alarmed.  The  child  shall  be  allowed  to
         express himself in his own way and at his own speed.  If he appears
         tired  or  distressed,  the  interview  will  be  suspended.    The
         interviewer should then consider whether it  would  be  appropriate
         for the interview to be resumed the same day or on another day."

14. In JA (Afghanistan) at paragraph 24 Lord Justice Moore-Bick  with  whom
    the other Lord Justices were in agreement had this to say:-

         "24. In the absence of a statutory provision  of  the  kind  to  be
             found in Section 78 of the Police and  Criminal  Evidence  Act
             1984, I do not think that in  proceedings  of  this  kind  the
             Tribunal has the power to exclude relevant evidence.  It does,
             however, have an obligation to consider  with  care  how  much
             weight  is  to  be  attached  to  it,  having  regard  to  the
             circumstances in  which  it  came  into  existence.   That  is
             particularly important when considering the significance to be
             attached to answers given in the course of  an  interview  and
             recorded only by the person asking questions on behalf of  the
             Secretary of State.  Such evidence may be  entirely  reliable,
             but   there   is   obviously    room    for    mistakes    and
             misunderstandings,  even  when  the  person  being  questioned
             speaks English fluently.  The  possibility  of  error  becomes
             greater  when  the  person  being  interviewed  requires   the
             services of an interpreter, particularly if the interpreter is
             not physically present.   It  becomes  greater  still  if  the
             person being interviewed is vulnerable by  reason  of  age  or
             infirmity.  The written word acquires a  degree  of  certainty
             which the spoken word may not command.  The 'anxious scrutiny'
             which all claimants for asylum are entitled to  expect  begins
             with  a  careful  consideration  of  the  weight  that  should
             properly be attached to answers given in their interviews.  In
             the present case the decision maker would need to bear in mind
             the age and background of the applicant, his  limited  command
             of English and  the  circumstances  under  which  the  initial
             interview and screening interview took place."

15. I do not quote verbatim from other paragraphs in JA, but it is apparent
    that in the absence of a responsible adult  care  should  be  taken  to
    avoid asking children interviewed to explain why  they  are  afraid  of
    being returned to their home countries.  Clearly it  is  necessary  for
    welfare purposes that Border Agency officials should  be  free  to  ask
    some questions of children when they  first  encounter  them,  but  the
    guidance suggests that they should not be designed to probe  any  claim
    for asylum.  AN recommends that those  making  decisions  about  asylum
    should not rely on details  or  information  obtained  from  interviews
    where no responsible adult or legal representative was  present  unless
    those details or information have been raised with the applicant during
    the substantive asylum interview in the presence of a responsible adult
    or  legal  representative,  and  the  applicant  has  been   given   an
    opportunity to provide an explanation.  (Paragraph 29)

16. I conclude from a perusal of the authorities that the  position  is  as
    set out in paragraph 34 of JA  (Afghanistan),  (I  paraphrase),  namely
    that a failure to  observe  the  proper  procedures  when  interviewing
    children does not render their answers inadmissible.   It  affects  the
    weight to be attached  to  the  evidence,  but  does  not  prevent  the
    decision maker from taking it into account altogether.   Secondly,  the
    decision maker should exercise a considerable degree of caution  before
    relying on answers given in the course of interviews of  children  that
    have not been conducted in the presence of a  legal  representative  or
    responsible adult.

17. Paragraph 34 of JA then goes on to state that  given  the  age  of  the
    present appellant (in that appeal) at the time of  the  interviews  the
    second of those principles is clearly of relevance.  I  note  that  the
    appellant in that appeal was 14� years old  when  he  was  interviewed.
    The appellant in the current appeal was 17� years of age at the date of
    his screening interview.  Absent other  distinguishing  factors  it  is
    reasonable to attach more weight to evidence obtained at interview from
    a child of 17 than a child of 14.

18. Upon looking at the  determination  I  observe  that  Mr  Collins,  who
    appeared for the appellant at the First-tier  hearing,  submitted  that
    the decision of the respondent was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
    because the appellant was a child and there had not been an appropriate
    adult at the interview.  He cited AN and  submitted  that  no  reliance
    could  be  placed  on  that  interview.   He  referred  also   to   the
    Presidential Guidance.  The judge was therefore aware from the start of
    the hearing of what was in issue.  I look at her findings.

19.  At paragraph 8 the judge expressed herself mindful of  the  fact  that
    the appellant was still under 18 and that  he  was  accompanied  by  an
    interpreter as an appropriate adult (at the  hearing).   She  noted  at
    paragraph 12 that in his screening interview the  appellant  said  that
    his reason for coming to the UK was  because  his  father  ran  over  a
    person "by car".  That was the reason why the families were in a  blood
    feud. Asked what he thought would happen to him on return he said  they
    threatened that they were to kill them (i.e. him and his family).

20. Although undated there is  a  statement  from  the  appellant  that  is
    referred to by the judge at paragraph 13 as being a statement submitted
    before the appellant's asylum interview.  That statement is  typed  and
    must have been prepared by someone with legal knowledge as it concludes
    with a  statement  of  truth.   The  named  responsible  adult  at  the
    interview  in  October  2013  was  a  legal  representative  from   the
    appellant's solicitors who was clearly there throughout the process. On
    the final page that person makes reference to a supposed error  in  the
    interpretation of a few words in paragraph 13  of  the  interview  (see
    response to question 214).

21. I agree with the judge at paragraph 39 where she states that there  was
    an adult with the appellant at the substantive  interview,  this  being
    the legal representative.  The interviewer indicated on  the  interview
    record that she read out the explanation of the responsible adult role.
     Although at the end of the interview the appellant said  that  he  had
    understood most of the questions, the interpreter commented that  there
    were one or two words where he (or it may have been she) had intervened
    "but the interpreter had clarified".  The questions had been  rephrased
    and the judge, having noted that the  appellant  was  17  years  and  7
    months at the date of interview, further  commented  that  he  is  very
    mature and a composed young man who was able to  make  his  way  across
    Europe to the United Kingdom.  He had  gone  to  Hatton  Cross  Hearing
    Centre on his own and had arrived very early.  He lives in  Kent  which
    is a considerable distance from the court. The judge as  a  consequence
    did not find that the record (of interview) is one on which  she  could
    place little weight or that it should be disregarded.  She did  however
    take into account the appellant's age when considering his  ability  to
    answer all the questions.

22. It is a matter of argument as to whether it was reasonable in paragraph
    40 the judge found it reasonable for the appellant to have said that he
    had already been attacked when asked why he was  afraid  something  bad
    would happen to him on return.  His response was  "They  threatened  us
    that they are going to kill us".  This was during  the  course  of  the
    screening interview at  a  time  when  he  was  unaccompanied  but  the
    appellant answered a simple question with a simple answer.   Of  itself
    however, the judge's  comment  is  not  in  my  finding  of  particular
    importance.  In the following paragraph the judge  finds  a  number  of
    inconsistencies and implausibilities in  the  appellant's  story,  even
    taking into account that he was only 14 years old at the  time  of  the
    major incident.  The judge was entitled  to  note  the  inconsistencies
    between the statements and interview record and also the oral  evidence
    as set out at paragraph 43.

23. The judge did not deal directly with the Shekulli report  referring  to
    the death of Mr Sala following being hit by a bus driven  by  Mr  Agron
    Rizahi. This accident was given  as  the  reason  for  the  blood  feud
    against his family.  However, the judge recognised that the feud lay at
    the core of the appellant's claim and she found many reasons as to  why
    she did not accept that one had been  declared.   The  reasons  for  so
    finding were open to her and  disclose  no  error.   Nevertheless,  the
    judge went on to consider the situation in the event that the appellant
    had indeed been threatened by the Sala family and concluded that  there
    would be a sufficiency of protection  for  the  appellant  in  Albania.
    That conclusion is supported  by  reasons  set  out  in  paragraphs  61
    onwards, such that any errors that there may be in the determination do
    not amount to  material  errors  and  the  decision  of  the  judge  is
    therefore a safe one.

24. For the above reasons the decision of  the  judge  is  upheld  and  the
    appellant's claims are dismissed.

25. There has been no anonymity direction given  thus  far,  there  was  no
    application for one to be made and in  the  circumstances  revealed  by
    this appeal there would seem to be no  good  reason  why  an  anonymity
    direction should be made now and therefore I do not make one.
