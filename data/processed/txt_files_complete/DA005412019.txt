                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bartlett  promulgated  on  5  March  2020.   The
    appellant is a citizen of Lithuania born on 9 June  1984  and  appealed
    against a decision made by the Secretary of State on 25 October 2019 to
    deport her and to reject her human  rights  claim.   The  Secretary  of
    State decided to deport the appellant on the basis of  her  convictions
    for theft in 2018, a further conviction in March 2019 and a  series  of
    offences committed between June 2018 and  September  2019  relating  to
    shoplifting, possession of class A drugs  -  heroin,  possession  of  a
    knife blade, failing to surrender to  custody  and  to  which  she  was
    sentenced to a total of 21  months'  imprisonment.   The  Secretary  of
    State's case was that the appellant had not shown that she had acquired
    permanent right of residence and thus was not entitled to any  enhanced
    protection pursuant to  Regulation  27  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").

 2. The appellant gave  evidence  before  the  judge  explaining  that  she
    arrived in the United Kingdom in February 2012, had worked  irregularly
    and then found work in a hotel which she did for two years  from  2013.
    She went on maternity leave in June to May  2014,  took  seven  months'
    maternity leave and then found a new flat having fled her boyfriend and
    started working for the hotel WGC Services in January 2015  again.   In
    January 2015 the children went to live with the appellant's  mother  in
    Lithuania because of problems with Social Services and she had she said
    worked irregularly after that.

 3. The judge noted the decision letter and concluded with  regard  to  the
    EEA Regulations that:-

      1) The appellant had earned minimal amounts of money, there  being  no
         year in which she had  met  the  earnings  threshold  for  tax  and
         national insurance contributions;

      2) even if it was accepted that she was a worker in the tax years 2012
         to 2013, 2013 to 2014 and because she was  a  qualified  person  as
         being on maternity leave in 2014 to 2015, she could only  show  she
         had been exercising treaty rights for a period of three years,  the
         remaining rights not establishing that she was a worker because  of
         the minimal nature of the earnings;

      3) the appellant was therefore not entitled to any enhanced protection
         under regulation 27 (3);

      4) having had regard to the factors set out in paragraph [14] and  the
         circumstances relating to the convictions, that is the drug taking,
         theft  and  other  offences  to  support  the  drug   habit,    the
         appellant's deportation was justified under Regulation 27(5);

      5)  with regard to paragraph 276 ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules   and
         the relevant factors as well as the possibility of  rehabilitation,
         she found that the decision was proportionate.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal on the  grounds  that
    the judge had erred, first in her assessment of whether  the  appellant
    had acquired permanent residence  in  that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    consider Regulation 6(2) of the EEA Regulations,  that is had failed to
    consider whether if she were no longer working  that  this  might  have
    been because she was unable to work as a result of illness or accident,
    and failed therefore to take into account the appellant's own  evidence
    that there were periods which  she  did  not  work  due  to  drugs  and
    depression, and thus the decision was flawed.

 5. The appellant also averred that the judge had applied an incorrect test
    in considering whether the activity of work was effective  and  genuine
    and not marginal and ancillary following Levin [1982] EUECJ R-53/81 The
    fact that she did not  earn  enough  wages  to  pay  tax  and  national
    insurance was not a proper ground for concluding that this test was not
    met, but had the test been met the judge would have concluded that  the
    permanent right of residence had  been  acquired  and  accordingly  the
    decision was flawed there being no proper basis on which  it  could  be
    said that the threat the appellant poses was sufficiently serious, that
    she was not protected by the enhanced level of protection.

 6. It is also argued following Nouazli [2016] UKSC 16 that the  judge  had
    erred in not taking proper account of the fact  that  the  decision  to
    deport the appellant  interfered  with  her  right  of  work  and  free
    movement which was a matter to be taken into account  as  well  as  her
    rights to private and family life.

 7. Insofar as it is necessary I am satisfied that it is proper and correct
    to permit the appellant to rely on the  additional  grounds  of  appeal
    although it appears that there has been  no  formal  decision  on  that
    issue.

 8. The appellant  did  not  appear  at  the  previous  hearing  before  my
    colleague Judge Macleman and she did not appear today.  No  reason  has
    been advanced for her failure to attend, there is nothing  on  file  to
    indicate that she has changed address  and  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    notice of hearing was sent to the last known  address.   I  am  in  the
    circumstances satisfied  that  it  would  be  appropriate  and  in  the
    interests of justice to proceed to determine the appeal.

 9. Turning to  the  first  ground  it  is  necessary  to  have  regard  to
    Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations  which  specifies  who  are  to  be
    treated as qualified persons.  Reg 6 provides, so far as is relevant:

         6. "Qualified person"


          1) In these Regulations-


             "jobseeker" means an EEA national who satisfies conditions  A,
             B and, where relevant, C;


             "qualified person" means a person who is an EEA  national  and
             in the United Kingdom as-


               a) a jobseeker;


               b) a worker;


               c) ...


             "relevant period" means-


               a) in the case of a  person  retaining  worker  status  under
                  paragraph (2)(b)  or  self-employed  person  status  under
                  paragraph (4)(b)]1 , a continuous period of six months;


               b) in the case of a jobseeker, 91 days, minus the  cumulative
                  total of  any  days  during  which  the  person  concerned
                  previously enjoyed a right to reside as a  jobseeker,  not
                  including any days prior to a continuous absence from  the
                  United Kingdom of at least 12 months.


          2) A person who is no longer working must continue to be  treated
             as a worker provided that the person-


               a) is temporarily unable to work as the result of an  illness
                  or accident;


               b) is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after  having
                  been employed in the United Kingdom for at least one year,
                  provided the person-


                   i) has registered  as  a  jobseeker  with  the  relevant
                      employment office; and


                      (ii)  satisfies conditions A and B;


               c) is in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after  having
                  been employed in the United  Kingdom  for  less  than  one
                  year, provided the person-


                   i) has registered  as  a  jobseeker  with  the  relevant
                      employment office; and(ii)   satisfies  conditions  A
                      and B;


               d) is involuntarily unemployed and has embarked on vocational
                  training; or


               e)  has  voluntarily  ceased  working  and  has  embarked  on
                  vocational  training  that  is  related  to  the  person's
                  previous employment.


          3) A person to whom paragraph  (2)(c)  applies  may  only  retain
             worker status for a maximum of six months


         ...


10. It is important to note that a worker does not automatically  cease  to
    be a worker if they cease employment as is seen in Regulation 6(2).

11. In assessing the evidence  I  find  that  the  judge  did  err  in  the
    direction at paragraph [11] when she found that the appellant's  income
    was minimal.  That is not the correct test which is  that  set  out  in
    Levin as noted in the grounds of appeal.

12. But, is that material?  I consider that it is  not  for  the  following
    reasons.  While it is evident from  the  material  from  HM  Customs  &
    Revenue that the appellant was earning in the tax years 2011  to  2012,
    2012 to 2013 and 2013 to 2014 at a level of  �7,963.76  and  �6,920.48.
    Although  that  is  below  the  National  Insurance  and   Income   Tax
    thresholds, it is nonetheless  sufficient  in  my  view  to  constitute
    genuine and effective work given that it  appears  to  have  been  made
    under a contract for employment.  I am satisfied also that there  is  a
    material misdirection in that there is a failure to take  into  account
    the 2014 to 2015 tax years in which there were 39  incapacity  or  sick
    benefit credits.  That in my experience would relate  to  39  weeks  in
    which those were paid.  Those would, given  they  are  state  benefits,
    appear to me to meet the requirements set  out  in  Regulation  6(2)(a)
    indicating a temporary inability to work.  That  it  was  temporary  is
    shown by the fact that she went back to work.

13. Following Weldemichael and another ( St  Prix  [2014]  EUECJ  C-507/12;
    effect ) [2015] UKUT 540 (IAC) , the time spent  by  the  appellant  on
    maternity leave does not break her continuity of residence. I  consider
    that the appellant was a worker or otherwise a qualified  person  until
    the end of the tax year 2014 and indeed 2014/2015.

14. There is, however, little or no evidence relating to what she was doing
    in the tax year 2015 to 2016.  She earned �432.96 and  it  is  of  note
    that in her evidence when asked she said that she could not remember if
    she was not working because she was too unwell.

15. Unlike the case of the earnings in the  previous  tax  years  there  is
    therefore no evidence sufficient  to  show  that  she  was  temporarily
    incapacitated from work owing to illness or  accident.   The  level  of
    income is I consider so low when considered on a  weekly  basis  as  to
    amount to marginal or ancillary.  While  the  grounds  of  appeal  make
    reference to �50 a week being perhaps enough to live on if one does not
    have to meet accommodation costs, �432.96 is well below that figure and
    indeed is below �10 a week and is clearly marginal or ancillary.

16. Further, there is no  evidence  that  she  meets  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 6(2)(b), (c), (d) or (e) and  thus  even  though  the  judge
    appears to have materially misdirected herself with regard to  earnings
    in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 there is still a gap in the appellant  being
    a worker in the tax year 2015/2016.

17. In order to acquire the right of permanent residence, an  EEA  national
    must, as  required  by  Regulation  15,  have  accumulated  five  years
    continuous residence in accordance with  the  EEA  Regulations.   Here,
    there was a significant period - 2015/2016 when there  is  insufficient
    evidence to show that  the  appellant  was  a  worker  or  otherwise  a
    qualified person and on that basis, any error from the misdirection  as
    to the relevant test was not material as, even taking  the  appellant's
    evidence at its highest, there is still a gap in which she  was  not  a
    worker or otherwise a qualified person.  For these reasons ground 1  is
    not made out.

18. Dealing with ground 2, I do not consider that on a  proper  application
    of Nouazli that it could be said that the judge  did  not  have  regard
    properly to the appellant's right to work being taken into account.  As
    found, she had a chaotic lifestyle, there was no  indication  that  she
    was now working and little or no evidence to show she had any  prospect
    of work in the future despite her plans for the future.  The judge  did
    I consider note  the  appellant's  intentions  as  is  shown  from  the
    decision at paragraph 14, and equally I note that the judge  gave  good
    reasons  set  out  at  paragraph  18  as  to  why  it  was  nonetheless
    proportionate for the appellant to be removed from the United  Kingdom.
    It is also of note that the judge noted the appellant's  rehabilitation
    was ongoing and rejected, which is unchallenged, the reasons  that  the
    appellant would earn more in the  United  Kingdom  than  in  Lithuania.
    Accordingly, for these reasons, I find that the second  ground  is  not
    made out.

19. For these reasons I consider that the appellant has failed to show that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I uphold it.


Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error of law and I uphold it.

 2. No anonymity direction is made.
