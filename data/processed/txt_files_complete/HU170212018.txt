This has been a remote hearing to which both parties have consented. The
form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face to face hearing was
not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be determined
in a remote hearing. I did not experience any difficulties, and neither
party expressed any concern, with the process.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. By my decision promulgated on 29 June 2020, I set aside the decision
      of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lucas promulgated on 15 July 2019.
      I now re-make that decision.

   Background


   2. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 3 July 2001.

   3. The appellant's father ("the sponsor") entered  the  UK  in  May  2001
      (before the appellant was born) and claimed  asylum.  He  was  granted
      refugee status and became a British citizen in 2009.

   4. On 10 May 2018 the appellant applied for entry clearance in  order  to
      join his father in the UK.  On  6  August  2018  the  application  was
      refused. The respondent  did  not  accept  that  the  sponsor  is  the
      appellant's father, or that he has had sole  responsibility  for  him.
      The application was refused under paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration
      Rules and under article 8 ECHR.

   5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where the appeal was
      heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lucas on 26 June  2019.  The
      appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal was that (a) paragraph
      297 of the Immigration Rules was satisfied because the sponsor,  whose
      paternity  had  been  established  by  DNA  evidence,  has  had  "sole
      responsibility" for the appellant;  and  (b)  refusing  the  appellant
      entry clearance would be disproportionate under article 8 ECHR.

   6. Judge Lucas found that the evidence did not establish that the sponsor
      has had sole responsibility under paragraph 297. However, he  did  not
      address article 8 ECHR. I found in my error of law decision that  this
      was erroneous in law because although finding that the requirements of
      paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules were not satisfied is  relevant
      to an assessment under article 8 it is not determinative, as a  father
      can have a family life within the meaning of article 8  with  his  son
      even if he has not  had  "sole  responsibility"  for  him  within  the
      meaning of  paragraph  297.  I  preserved  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      findings (at paragraphs 22 -  26  of  the  decision)  concerning  sole
      responsibility under  paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
      informed the parties that  the  re-making  of  the  decision  will  be
      concerned  with  whether  refusal  of   entry   breaches   article   8
      notwithstanding that the appellant does not satisfy paragraph 297  for
      the reasons given in paragraphs 22 - 26  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      decision.

   7. The preserved findings of fact, in paragraphs 22 - 26  of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal decision, are as follows:


           a. The sponsor is a refugee from Afghanistan  but  there  is  no
              evidence to show that he  would  have  difficulty  living  in
              Pakistan, where his family,  including  the  appellant,  have
              lived since 2001. There is "an element of choice" on the part
              of the sponsor in choosing to live apart from his  family  in
              Pakistan.


           b. There is little or no evidence to show that the  sponsor  had
              sole responsibility for the appellant  during  his  years  of
              growing up. The evidence of remittances, from  2017  -  2019,
              are contemporaneous with the application.


           c. There is no evidence from independent professionals, such  as
              teachers at the appellant's school, to show the  sponsor  has
              had a role in the appellant's life.


           d. It is accepted that there are phone records showing  frequent
              calls to Pakistan in 2019.


           e. The appellant has had a  family  life  with  his  mother  and
              brother in Pakistan, where they have lived  for  many  years,
              and there is no evidence to show that the  family's  position
              has become precarious.

   8. The appellant has an older brother, born on 3 August  2000,  who  also
      applied for entry clearance. His application  was  refused  in  August
      2018 and his subsequent appeal was dismissed. The First-tier  Tribunal
      judge in that case (Judge  Khan)  found  that  paragraph  297  of  the
      Immigration Rules was not satisfied because the sponsor and  his  wife
      shared responsibility for the  upbringing  of  the  appellant's  elder
      brother. It was accepted that article 8(1) was engaged  but  not  that
      refusing entry would be disproportionate.

   9. The appellant claims that his mother died  on  1  July  2020  and  has
      provided a death certificate as confirmation. It is  not  accepted  by
      the respondent that his mother died or that the death certificate  can
      be relied upon.


  10. At the hearing I heard  oral  evidence  (remotely)  from  the  sponsor
      through an interpreter. Mr Whitwell's cross-examination was  extensive
      and as a result I developed a  far  fuller  (and  somewhat  different)
      picture of the relevant circumstances than emerges from  a  review  of
      the written statements of the sponsor and appellant.

  11. The appellant did not attend the hearing and therefore I did not  have
      the benefit of hearing his oral evidence. As he lives in  Afghanistan,
      I do not draw a negative inference from his non-attendance.

   Evidence of the appellant

  12. The appellant's (brief) witness statement dated 20 October 2020 states
      that he lived with his mother until she died on 1 July 2020 of a heart
      attack whilst they were in Afghanistan attending a wedding.

  13. The appellant states that his mother took  care  of  him  and  he  was
      dependent on her. He states that  he  is  currently  living  with  his
      grandmother and does not have any relatives or  close  family  members
      who can provide for him.

  14. He states that his father is the only one he has left when it comes to
      family and that he needs his father.

   Evidence of the sponsor

  15. In his witness statement dated 11 June 2019 the  sponsor  states  that
      after he arrived in the UK his wife and children moved to Pakistan for
      safety reasons. He states that he kept in contact with and financially
      supported his family, and that the  reason  he  did  not  sponsor  his
      family to join him in the UK earlier is that he was not advised of his
      rights. He states  that  he  takes  decisions  for  his  children.  At
      paragraph 10 of the witness statement  he  states  that  "both  of  my
      children" have completed their school and that he wants them  to  come
      to the UK as they need their father in their life to  guide  them.  He
      also states in the witness statement that he is employed in  a  burger
      shop earning �2,500 a month and is in a strong position to accommodate
      his children.

  16.  During  cross  examination  the  sponsor  gave  further   information
      including, in particular, that:

        a. He is illiterate and uneducated.


        b. He has seven children, the youngest of whom (born in 2009) is  a
           British citizen. He stated that he has four daughters, three  of
           whom are married and one of whom is engaged.


        c. His wife died on 1 July 2020, whilst  visiting  Afghanistan,  of
           Covid-19.

        d. Since the death of their mother, his three  sons  and  unmarried
           daughter have lived with their maternal grandmother in a village
           near Kabul. They  have  three  maternal  uncles  living  in  the
           village who are farmers, who provide financial  support  to  the
           appellant's grandmother.

        e. He visited his children in Afghanistan  recently  and  the  only
           reason he did not go sooner following his wife's death  was  the
           travel impediments caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

        f. He has visited his family in Pakistan frequently (at least  once
           every two years) and several years ago spent  three  years  with
           them.

        g. The monthly remittance of �130 that he sends to  Afghanistan  is
           for his three sons (not just the appellant).

        h. He has adequate accommodation for his sons to live with him  and
           sufficient income to support them in the UK.

        i. He would like his three sons to join him together in the UK.  He
           was uncertain as to whether he would want his youngest son  (who
           is a British  citizen)  to  come  if  his  other  sons  are  not
           permitted to do so.

   Submissions

  17. Mr Whitwell submitted that the sponsor was not being truthful  in  his
      evidence. He supported this contention  by  commenting  that  (a)  the
      sponsor's oral evidence that he  has  seven  children,  four  of  whom
      (including the appellant) live together  with  their  grandmother,  is
      inconsistent with the witness  statements  of  both  the  sponsor  and
      appellant which give the impression that  the  sponsor  only  has  two
      children (his sons who applied for entry clearance) and that they  are
      alone with their grandmother;  (b)  the  witness  statements  omit  to
      mention the presence of economically  active  uncles  in  the  village
      where  the  appellant  is  now  living;  (c)  in  the  appeal  by  the
      appellant's elder brother it is said (at paragraph 7 of  Judge  Khan's
      decision) that the appellant had three  (rather  than  four)  sisters,
      which is yet another inconsistency  about  the  family;  and  (d)  the
      sponsor gave a different cause of death for his wife  than  stated  on
      the death certificate.

  18. Mr Whitwell argued that the  death  certificate  for  the  appellant's
      mother was not a reliable document. He observed that  the  section  of
      the certificate where the  location  of  death  is  inserted  was  not
      completed and that there was a gap of six weeks between the death  and
      its registration. He referred to the respondent's background  note  on
      Afghanistan dated December 2020 where in paragraph 13.1 it  is  stated
      that it is easy to obtain forged documents, as well as valid documents
      with incorrect information.

  19. Mr Whitwell submitted that the evidence does not support a  conclusion
      that article 8(1) is engaged. He stated that the appellant is an adult
      and that there must be ties which go beyond  the  normal  relationship
      between a parent and adult child. He argued that  the  timing  of  the
      appellant's entry clearance application (made at a time  when  he  and
      his elder brother were at an age they could enter the  labour  market)
      indicates that the sponsor's reason for bringing his sons to the UK is
      for them to gain employment, not because of a family relationship.  He
      argued that this is reinforced by the fact that the  sponsor  has  not
      brought his youngest son (aged 11) to the UK even though there  is  no
      impediment to him doing so.

  20. Mr Whitwell argued, in the alternative, that refusing entry would  not
      be disproportionate under article 8 (2) because the appellant  is  not
      alone with his elderly grandmother but rather is living in  a  village
      with several uncles and  in  a  home  with  three  siblings.  He  also
      submitted that weight should be placed on the fact that  there  is  no
      evidence that the appellant speaks English  or  to  show  that  he  is
      experiencing harsh or difficult circumstances living with  his  family
      in Afghanistan.

  21. Mr Coffey submitted that any apparent discrepancies in  the  sponsor's
      evidence can be explained by his illiteracy, lack  of  education,  and
      reliance on interpreters; and that the sponsor  has  been  a  truthful
      witness. With respect to the death certificate, Mr  Coffey  maintained
      that no evidence had been submitted, or  arguments  made,  which  cast
      doubt on its validity.

  22. He argued that article 8(1) is engaged because the evidence  indicates
      that there exists a close  and  subsisting  relationship  between  the
      sponsor and  the  appellant,  where  the  sponsor  provides  financial
      support to the appellant (remittances of �130 a month) and  speaks  to
      him frequently.  Mr  Coffey  submitted  that  this  constitutes  real,
      committed and effective support.

  23. With respect to proportionality under article 8(2), Mr  Coffey  argued
      that the appellant's circumstances need  to  be  considered  alongside
      those of his siblings, as if the appellant  were  to  succeed  in  his
      appeal then his brothers would follow him to the UK, and therefore  it
      cannot be said that by  coming  to  the  UK  the  appellant  would  be
      separated from them. He  noted,  also,  that  although  the  appellant
      currently lives with one of his sisters, this will  cease  to  be  the
      case shortly given that she is soon to  be  married.  Mr  Coffey  also
      argued that weight should be attached to the regular  contact  between
      the sponsor and appellant, the remittances from the sponsor of �130  a
      month, the  death  of  the  sponsor's  mother  which  means  that  the
      appellant has no other parent, and the support that the  sponsor  will
      need from his son as he gets older.

  24.  Mr  Coffey  also  argued  that  the  public  interest  in   effective
      immigration  control  is  reduced  because  the  sponsor  could   have
      sponsored his wife and children to come to the UK but did not  realise
      that he had this option. Further points said by Mr Coffey to weigh  in
      the appellant's favour are that the sponsor earns �30,000 a  year  and
      has a flat capable of accommodating him.

   Findings of fact

  25. The witness statements of the appellant and sponsor  give  a  partial,
      incomplete and inaccurate impression of the appellant's  circumstances
      in Afghanistan (and previously Pakistan). However, I am satisfied that
      this is not because they have been  dishonest,  but  rather  it  is  a
      reflection of the difficulties of  an  illiterate  person,  unfamiliar
      with  what  is  required,  in  preparing  a  witness  statement.   The
      impression I have formed, having heard the sponsor give  evidence,  is
      that the evidence he gave at the hearing was truthful.

  26. I make the following findings of fact:

        a. The sponsor came to the UK from Afghanistan whilst his wife  was
           pregnant with the appellant. Shortly  after  the  appellant  was
           born,  the  appellant's  mother  moved  to  Pakistan  with   her
           children.


        b. The appellant is one of seven children (four daughters and three
           sons). The youngest child (a son, aged 11) is a British citizen.

        c. The appellant's mother died in July 2020.

        d. Three of the sponsor's daughters are married and live with their
           husbands.

        e. The other children of  the  sponsor  live  with  their  maternal
           grandmother in Afghanistan, and have done so since their  mother
           died. They live in  a  village  where  there  are  wider  family
           members  including  three  uncles  who  work  as   farmers   who
           financially support the appellant's grandmother.

        f. The sponsor has, for at least  several  years,  sent  funds  (of
           around �130 a month) regularly to his family in Pakistan (now in
           Afghanistan). These funds are not just for the  appellant.  They
           are to support his unmarried  children and, before she died, his
           wife.

        g.  The  sponsor  has  visited  his  family  in  Pakistan  (now  in
           Afghanistan) regularly and on one occasion for a period of three
           years.

        h. The sponsor earns approximately �2,500 a month and  has  a  flat
           which could accommodate his the appellant.

        i. The sponsor did not seek to bring the appellant  and  his  elder
           brother to the UK until 2018 (when they were almost  adults)  in
           part because he did not realise he could bring them earlier  but
           also because by this time they were at an age where  they  could
           function independently. He did not bring his youngest  son  (who
           is a British  national,  aged  11)  even  though  there  was  no
           impediment to do so. Moreover, even following his wife's  death,
           he has not brought his youngest  son  to  the  UK,  who  instead
           remains  in  Afghanistan  with  his  siblings,  grandmother  and
           uncles.

   Analysis

  27. There are two issues to be determined. The first  is  whether  article
      8(1) ECHR is engaged. If it is not, then the  appeal  cannot  succeed.
      The second issue, which only arises if article  8(1)  is  engaged,  is
      whether refusing entry clearance to  the  appellant  is  proportionate
      under article 8(2).

   Is Article 8(1) engaged?

  28. Whether or not the appellant enjoys family life with his father  under
      article 8(1) is a question of fact which requires consideration to  be
      given to all of the relevant circumstances. As explained  in  Singh  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  630  at
      [24]:


           "24. I do not think that the judgments to which I have  referred
           lead to any difficulty in determining the  correct  approach  to
           Article 8 in cases involving adult  children.  In  the  case  of
           adults, in the context of immigration control, there is no legal
           or factual presumption as to the existence or absence of  family
           life for the purposes  of  Article  8.  I  point  out  that  the
           approach of the  European  Commission  for  Human  Rights  cited
           approvingly in Kugathas  did  not  include  any  requirement  of
           exceptionality. It all  depends  on  the  facts.  The  love  and
           affection between an adult and his parents or siblings will  not
           of itself justify a finding of a family life. There  has  to  be
           something more.  A  young  adult  living  with  his  parents  or
           siblings will normally have a family life to be respected  under
           Article 8. A child enjoying a family life with his parents  does
           not suddenly cease to have a family life at midnight as he turns
           18 years of age.  On  the  other  hand,  a  young  adult  living
           independently of his parents may well not have a family life for
           the purposes of Article 8.

  29. I accept that the appellant and sponsor  have  a  relationship  and  a
      desire to live together in the UK, but the evidence does not show  (on
      the balance of probabilities) that the appellant is provided with  any
      real or effective support from the sponsor or that they have more than
      normal emotional ties. I  reach  this  conclusion  for  the  following
      reasons:

        a. Although the sponsor has been (and is) clearly  able  to  reside
           with the appellant (and his siblings) in Pakistan - his evidence
           at the hearing was that on one occasion  he  spent  three  years
           with them in Pakistan- he has chosen to not do so and has  lived
           separately from the  appellant  throughout  nearly  all  of  the
           appellant's life.


        b. The sponsor regularly sends funds to his family in Pakistan (now
           Afghanistan), but his evidence at the hearing was not that these
           funds are solely for the appellant but rather they are  for  the
           family as a whole, which includes his 11-year-old son. There was
           no  evidence  before  me  indicating  that  the   appellant   is
           economically inactive and does not earn an income or  explaining
           why, when he lives in  a  village  with  three  uncles  who  are
           farmers,  he  is  unable  to  support  himself  and  relies   on
           remittances from the sponsor.  Having  regard  to  the  evidence
           given by the sponsor orally, and considering it as  a  whole,  I
           consider it more  likely  than  not  that  the  remittances  are
           primarily intended (and used) for the sponsor's 11-year-old son,
           who is not in a position to earn an  income,  and  not  for  the
           appellant and his elder brother.

        c. There was no evidence from the sponsor or appellant showing  any
           emotional support between them.  The  appellant  states  in  his
           witness statement that he wants to be with his father so that he
           is not "deprived of his love and care" but does not describe, at
           all, whether (and how) the sponsor has supported him emotionally
           or in any way throughout his life.

  30. I am therefore not satisfied that the appellant has established, on
      the balance of probabilities, that his relationship with the sponsor
      engages article 8(1).


   Is it proportionate under article 8(2) to refuse entry to the appellant?


  31. As I have found article 8 is not engaged, it is not necessary to
      consider proportionality. For completeness, however, I have
      considered, in the alternative, whether refusing entry is
      proportionate.

  32. Weighing against the appellant is that:

        a. The evidence does not show a particularly close relationship
           between the appellant and sponsor.


        b. The evidence does not show that the sponsor is without family
           support in Afghanistan or that he faces difficult circumstances.
           On the contrary, the evidence indicates that the appellant lives
           with several family members in a village where he has wider
           family, and that his wider family are farmers and generate an
           income. Moreover, the sponsor has decided to leave his youngest
           son (who is a British national) in Afghanistan with the same
           family as the appellant even though he could at any time bring
           him to the UK.

        c. The appellant is unable to establish a right to reside in the UK
           under the Immigration Rules and the public interest in the
           maintenance of effective immigration control weighs against him:
           Section 117B(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
           2002 ("the 2002 Act")

        d. The appellant has not adduced evidence establishing he speaks
           English and his lack of English weighs against him: Section
           117B(2) of the 2002 Act

  33. Weighing in the appellant's favour is that:

        a. The appellant and the sponsor have a strong wish to reside
           together (with the sponsor's other sons) in the UK.

        b. The appellant has recently lost his mother and the sponsor is
           his only living parent.

        c. Had the sponsor been properly advised he would more likely than
           not have been able to bring his family to the UK when the
           children were younger.

        d. The appellant is unlikely to be a financial burden given the
           sponsor's income.

  34. Weighing the considerations set out above, I am satisfied that denying
      entry to the appellant is proportionate.
