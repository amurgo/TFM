Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a male national of Egypt born on the 6th October 1975.
     He has permission[1] to appeal against a determination of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Holt)[2] to dismiss his appeal against a  decision
    to refuse to grant him a residence card confirming his right to  reside
    in the United Kingdom under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.

 2. The basis of the Appellant's application for a residence card  was  his
    claimed relationship with a Swedish national named  Sonia  Nassar.   He
    had made an application for a  residence  permit  as  a  family  member
    (unmarried partner) of Ms Nassar in 2013 but this had been refused.  An
    appeal against that decision had been dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cruthers on the 24th March 2014.  The  Appellant  and  Ms  Nassar
    married in Manchester on the 31st March 2014 and a new application  was
    submitted.  The Respondent rejected the application on the grounds that
    the  parties  had  provided  inconsistent  answers  about  their  lives
    together, giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the Appellant  had
    entered  into  a  marriage  of  convenience  in  order  to   circumvent
    immigration control.

 3. The matter came before the First-tier Tribunal.   Judge  Holt  directed
    herself to the earlier determination by  Judge  Cruthers,  and  to  the
    principle delineated in Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702: "matters decided
    by that Judge stand.  I cannot go behind that first  decision".   Those
    findings were  that  this  relationship  was  a  "contrivance".   Judge
    Cruthers expressed regret that he was unable to  accept  anything  that
    the  Appellant  and  Ms  Nassar  had  told  him  about  their   claimed
    relationship.  Judge Holt heard evidence that the Appellant had entered
    the United Kingdom in 2008 pretending to be an Iraqi.   That  dishonest
    behaviour was found to be consistent with Judge Cruthers' assessment of
    his character.  Judge Holt had regard to a  detailed  interview  record
    and herself heard oral evidence from the Appellant, his  wife  and  her
    daughter.  Having done so she found that this was an appellant who  was
    "desperate" to stay in the United Kingdom  and  who  would  do  or  say
    anything in order to get leave to remain.  To this end he  had  entered
    into the marriage with Ms Nassar and had spent some time  at  her  home
    "picking up some personal information  about  her  and  her  children".
    Such areas of consistency between the witnesses that was to be found in
    the   evidence   was   attributed   to   rehearsal.    Those    efforts
    notwithstanding, there remained some significant areas of inconsistency
    in the evidence:

          i) At interview the Appellant stated that prior to his arrival in
             the UK he had worked as a butcher in Egypt; she  said  he  had
             worked in a shop in Kuwait

         ii) At hearing he  attempted  to  resolve  this  inconsistency  by
             telling Judge Holt that he had transited in Egypt on  the  way
             to the UK from Kuwait by air

        iii) This was again  inconsistent  with  what  he  had  told  Judge
             Cruthers in 2014, namely that he had entered the UK  illegally
             in the back of a lorry

         iv) At interview the Appellant said that in  2013  Ms  Nassar  had
             gone on an Umra trip to Saudi Arabia; she said  that  she  had
             been in Sweden depositing gold in a bank

          v) At the hearing the witnesses both claimed that she had been to
             Saudi Arabia and Sweden on that trip

         vi) He had initially said that she had been away for 7  days;  she
             said it was 10

        vii) Neither party could name one of the witnesses to their  nikah,
             conducted at the Egyptian embassy in London

       viii) He said that they had travelled back to Manchester by car; she
             said they came on the train

         ix) He attempted to resolve  this  inconsistency  by  saying  that
             there were two trips, one for the actual ceremony and  one  to
             collect  the  certificate.   When  asked  about  how  she  had
             returned from London on this second trip Ms Nassar "could  not
             remember"

          x) The Appellant could not say where the central  heating  boiler
             was in the house

 4. In addition to these inconsistencies  Judge  Holt  noted  the  lack  of
    recent corroborative evidence that the couple had actually been  living
    together.  There were  no  utility  bills  etc.  which  post-dated  the
    material seen by Judge Cruthers.  The Judge found it not to be credible
    that they had not discussed what might happen if the Appellant were  to
    be required to leave the UK.   One  of  Ms  Nassar's  adult  daughters,
    Zainab, gave "cagey" evidence at the hearing.  She did not  attend  her
    mother's nikah or English registration.  When asked  why  she  had  not
    come the Appellant had said that she "did not have time" because it had
    been only two weeks before her own wedding; although  this  might  have
    provided an explanation as to why she had not attended the nikah it did
    not explain her absence from the registration in Manchester, which took
    place a year after her own.  The  Appellants'  counsel  had  taken  the
    Tribunal to the many consistent answers in the Home  Office  interview.
    Judge Holt agreed that there were many answers which the Appellant  did
    know, such as the colour  of  the  soft  furnishings  in  the  bedroom.
    Observing that  these  are  the  kind  of  questions  that  immigration
    officers very often ask at such interviews, the Tribunal concludes that
    the Appellant has learnt the answers.  She  contrasts  his  ability  to
    describe the dï¿½cor in the bedroom with his inability to say  where  the
    central heating boiler is, a matter he might reasonably be expected  to
    know if he had actually been living in  that  house  for  a  number  of
    years.

 5. The main evidence which supported the Appellant's case was the evidence
    that Ms Nassar's children are unhappy about  him  living  there.   This
    distress had prompted one of them to be sent to Lebanon,  allegedly  to
    receive medical treatment for mental illness.  Although  this  evidence
    was capable of supporting the claim that he was living  in  the  house,
    Judge Holt noted that there can  be  many  reasons  why  teenagers  are
    unhappy; the fact that there is tension in the household because of the
    Appellant's presence does not  necessarily  indicate  that  this  is  a
    genuine relationship.

 6. The appeal was thereby, comprehensively, dismissed.




    The Appeal

 7. The Appellant now submits that the  decision  of  Judge  Holt  contains
    numerous errors of law such that it should be set aside.  These include
    a lack of procedural fairness, a failure to take material evidence into
    account, weighing in irrelevant matters, failing to  give  reasons  and
    ultimately irrationality: it is submitted that the weight  of  evidence
    was such that no properly directed Tribunal  could  have  come  to  the
    conclusions reached by Judge Holt.

 8. The Respondent opposes the appeal on all grounds, submitting  that  the
    decision was one open to the Judge on the evidence before her.  That is
    particularly so given the findings of Judge Cruthers.




    Error of Law: My Findings

 9. The grounds and submissions made by Ms Mair were closely argued: it  is
    convenient if I address them, Ms Johnstone's response, and my findings,
    together.




    Procedural Unfairness

10. A central finding of the First-tier Tribunal was  that  the  consistent
    answers produced when the Appellant and Ms Nassar were interviewed  was
    the result of them having rehearsed the answers to the  questions  put.
    The Appellant now challenges that finding on a number of  grounds  (see
    below) but first amongst them is that it was procedurally improper  for
    the Tribunal to  have  reached  this  conclusion  without  putting  the
    Appellant and other witnesses on notice that it was  a  forensic  point
    being taken against them.  Before me Ms Mair averred that  had  such  a
    point been put, she would have made submissions that may have  put  the
    Tribunal's mind at rest.   For  instance,  she  could  have  taken  her
    through the interview record and pointed to the  numerous  topics  that
    came up, which, Ms Mair submits, were not matters likely to  have  been
    rehearsed.

11. I am not satisfied that this ground  is  made  out.   As  Ms  Johnstone
    pointed out, the Appellant was clearly aware that the central matter in
    issue was whether his relationship with Ms Nassar was genuinely one  of
    husband and wife, or whether it was a "contrivance" as found  by  Judge
    Cruthers.  The Tribunal was not finding a different ground for  refusal
    than the Respondent had given.  The Respondent's case, plainly set  out
    in the refusal letter, was that the couple had given such  inconsistent
    evidence that there was a reasonable suspicion that they were not in  a
    real relationship.  The point made by Judge Holt is that what areas  of
    consistency could be found in their evidence was clearly  matters  that
    could have been rehearsed.  That  would  explain  the  ability  of  the
    Appellant to identify the colour of the bedroom etc.  It was not unfair
    for  her  to  have  made  this  comment.   The  nature  of  the  entire
    relationship was called into question -  that  was  the  issue  in  the
    appeal.  Further it would appear from Ms Mair's  submissions  that  she
    did take the Tribunal to the interview record in some detail.



    Irrelevant Considerations

12. At paragraph 31(i) the determination records a matter of  inconsistency
    in the evidence as follows:

         "I noted that the parties had not discussed about what would happen
         if the appellant was removed from the United Kingdom.  I find  that
         this would be an important and urgent issue  for  a  couple  facing
         being split up"

13. It is now submitted on  the  Appellant's  behalf  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  was  here  impermissibly  importing  into  its  assessment  a
    subjective analysis about how couples might be expected to behave.   It
    is submitted that how other  couples  communicate  is  not  a  relevant
    consideration for the Tribunal.

14. This ground is not made out.  This was an appellant who had entered the
    UK illegally, who had advanced a fraudulent asylum claim  and  who  had
    already  been  found  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  attempting  to
    circumvent the Immigration Rules and EEA Regulations by entering into a
    false marriage.  In those circumstances his forcible removal  from  the
    UK was not a distant or abstract possibility.  This was a sponsor  who,
    it was claimed, was causing distress to her children by entering into a
    relationship with the Appellant.  Judge Holt was entitled to  find,  in
    these circumstances, that the conversation would have taken place.   It
    would have been perfectly natural for the adults in  the  situation  to
    assess what they would do as a family if the  Appellant  were  removed.
    If no such conversation had ever taken place Judge Holt was entitled to
    conclude that this was because this is not in fact a real relationship.



    Relevant Evidence Not Considered

15. Ms Mair took me to several examples of reasoning in  the  determination
    which, she submits, was made without due  regard  to  the  explanations
    offered by the Appellant and Ms Nasser about alleged  discrepancies  in
    their  evidence.   For  instance,  the   Tribunal   finds   significant
    inconsistency in the accounts given about what the Appellant was  doing
    before he came to the UK [at 18], about how he and his wife got back to
    Manchester after their nikah [at 29] and at paragraph  21  onwards  the
    determination contrasts the evidence given about where Ms  Nassar  went
    in 2013.  It  is  submitted  that  these  findings  were  made  without
    weighing the Appellant's explanations.

16. I cannot be satisfied that the Tribunal failed to have  regard  to  the
    witness statements, or to the oral evidence.  Apart from the fact  that
    the determination expressly refers to both [paragraphs 5, 18,  20,  21,
    22, 24, 28, 29] it is apparent that the  Tribunal  has  considered  the
    explanations offered, but has rejected them: "I am satisfied  that  the
    inconsistency at interview and the attempt to explain inconsistency and
    'patch' over the inconsistency at the hearing again shows that this  is
    the couple who do not know much about each other's lives" [22];  "I  do
    not accept the purported explanation of confusion about  the  different
    modes of transport back from their first marriage ceremony in London.."
    [30].  The Tribunal was under no obligation to deal with  every  single
    point made on the  Appellant's  behalf.   The  Tribunal  was  under  no
    obligation to consider the evidence, apply the relevant  law  and  make
    clear findings.  I am quite satisfied that this  has  been  done.   The
    Appellant  can  be  left  in  no  doubt   what   the   findings   were,
    notwithstanding his explanations.



    Failure to Give Reasons

17.  At  paragraph  31(ii)  the  determination  says  the  following:  "the
    sponsor's daughter Zeinab came and gave evidence in a cagey  manner  in
    support of her mother".  This form of words is criticised on the ground
    that the Tribunal does not say in what way the evidence of  Zeinab  was
    "cagey", or why the Tribunal was apparently minded to  give  it  little
    weight.  I am not satisfied that this  ground  is  made  out.   If  the
    Tribunal had rejected her evidence on the basis that it was 'faltering'
    or 'evasive' that would have  been  a  reason:  'cagey'  is  a  similar
    adjective.  In fact the tribunal appears more concerned with  the  fact
    that Zeinab did not attend her mother's wedding, and with the fact that
    the Appellant was unable to name the place that Zeinab's  wedding  took
    place: "I find that if he had been genuinely in a relationship with the
    bride's mother in the run up to the wedding then the party  would  have
    been an important topic of conversation and it is inconceivable that he
    would have forgotten the name".



    Irrationality

18. The central ground of appeal  is  that  the  Tribunal  failed  to  give
    appropriate weight to the evidence in the Appellant's favour  and  that
    in so doing reached an overall finding that was not rationally open  to
    it.  Ms Mair emphasised the Tribunal's own  comments  about  the  "best
    evidence" that  the  children  disliked  the  Appellant  and  that  his
    presence had caused tension in the house, and stressed the quantity  of
    questions that the parties were able to give the same answers to at the
    interview.

19. The First-tier Tribunal did accept that the Appellant was known to this
    family, and that he had spent time in  the  house,  including  possible
    overnight stays.  It was not contested that Ms Nassar was  claiming  to
    be in a relationship with the Appellant or that they had married, under
    both religious custom and English law.  She accepted that  Ms  Nassar's
    grown-up children were generally not very happy  about  these  matters.
    It does not follow that the only conclusion she  could  draw  was  that
    this  was  in  fact  a  real  relationship.   There  could   be   other
    explanations for  the  tension  in  the  household.   They  might,  for
    instance, be annoyed that their mother is  supporting  the  Appellant's
    bid to remain in  the  UK.   It  cannot  be  said  therefore  that  the
    conclusion reached was not one rationally open to  the  Tribunal.   Nor
    can it be said that this evidence was not considered for the weight  it
    could potentially lend to the Appellant's case: see paragraph 16.

20. I have read the interview record.  It is correct to say that there were
    some areas of convergence; equally there  were  striking  instances  of
    divergence.  The matters upon which the interviewees  agreed  were  for
    the most part banal, and I agree with Judge Holt that these are matters
    which might be 'rehearsed' in preparation for testing: for instance the
    Appellant can name the children and the colour of objects in the house.
     Conversely  the  discrepancies  are  significant.   For  instance  the
    Appellant confidently reports that his wife went  to  Saudi  Arabia  or
    Umra  in  2013,  whereas  she  says  that  she  went  to  Sweden.   The
    explanation latterly offered, that she went to Sweden on the  way  home
    from Saudi Arabia and did not tell her husband, is flatly  contradicted
    by her statement at interview  that  she  flew  direct  to  Malmo  from
    Manchester.  This is not then a case  where  the  inconsistencies  were
    minor, and the consistent evidence so  overwhelming  that  no  properly
    directed Tribunal could have found it to  outweigh  them.   It  follows
    that it cannot be  said  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  conclusions  were
    irrational.



    Decisions

21. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error  of  law
    and it is upheld.
