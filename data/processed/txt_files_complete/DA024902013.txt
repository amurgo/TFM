                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and background

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana who was born on 15 June  1989.   He
    is said to have arrived in the UK in October 1992 when he was  3  years
    of age.  He was granted indefinite leave to remain on 5 August 2004.

 2. On 5 July 2013 he was convicted of an offence of possession of a  Class
    A controlled drug, namely cocaine, with intent to supply. He received a
    sentence of 30 months' imprisonment.  As a result of that conviction  a
    decision was made by the Secretary of State to make a deportation order
    the automatic deportation  provisions  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007,
    Section 32(5).  The  appellant's  appeal  against  that  decision  came
    before a panel of the  First-tier  Tribunal  consisting  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge A W Khan and Mrs L R Smith JP.  The  Tribunal  dismissed
    the appeal after a hearing on 1 April 2014.

 3. Central to the issues which the First-tier Tribunal  had  to  determine
    was the question of whether the appellant had "no ties" to Ghana.   The
    First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from the appellant and  three  other
    witnesses on his behalf; his mother  (Anita  Budu-Amoako),  his  sister
    (Baaba Budu-Amoako) and another witness by the name  of  Aaron  Mensah.
    The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence in relation  to  the  extent  to
    which the appellant was in contact  with  his  father  who  resides  in
    Ghana.  I can summarise the findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as
    follows.

 4. The Tribunal found that the appellant and the witnesses had exaggerated
    their evidence about the extent of contact with their father.   It  was
    stated at [20] that the appellant obviously regards the UK as his  home
    and claims he has no relatives apart from his father in Ghana, but  the
    Tribunal found that the witnesses and  the  appellant  had  exaggerated
    their evidence.  The panel found that the witnesses and  the  appellant
    had minimised the contact that he had with his father and at [20] there
    is reference to a telephone call that  the  evidence  suggested  was  a
    telephone call to the appellant's sister from the appellant's father at
    Christmas in 2013.  The  panel  concluded  that  there  had  been  more
    contact than the appellant is prepared to admit.

 5. In the same paragraph the panel went on to refer to a loan or a gift as
    they described it, of ï¿½10,000 from the appellant's father, in order for
    the appellant to pursue an accountancy course,  the  ACCA.   The  panel
    found that whether it was a gift or a loan, if  the  appellant  had  no
    meaningful contact with his father they would not have expected such  a
    large sum of money to have been given to him.  The panel did not accept
    that it was more in the  way  of  a  business  transaction.   There  is
    reference to evidence of the contact with  the  appellant's  father  on
    occasions such as Christmas and birthdays, and it  was  concluded  that
    the appellant had realistic and viable family links with Ghana.   There
    was also reference in [21] to visits to Ghana by the appellant on  four
    occasions, the last being in 2011.

 6. The panel also at [21] referred to the evidence of Aaron Mensah and the
    business opportunity in Ghana that it appeared may have  been  afforded
    to the appellant through Mr Mensah during a visit to Ghana in 2011.

 7. At [23] the panel referred to cultural links  that  the  appellant  has
    with Ghana because of his "heritage and  ethnicity"  and  both  of  his
    parents being Ghanaian.

 8. With reference to the immigration deportation rules  under  Article  8,
    the panel asked the question, if the appellant was not able to meet the
    requirements of the  rules  which  they  found  that  he  was  not,  in
    particular in the respect to  which  I  referred,  whether  there  were
    exceptional circumstances which  meant  that  the  public  interest  in
    deportation was outweighed by those other factors.  The panel  referred
    to the offence of which he was  convicted  and  to  other  evidence  in
    relation to what was said to be criminality which  did  not  result  in
    convictions. In respect of that evidence it does not seem to me that it
    featured very largely in their determination and it is not the  subject
    of any argument before me.  In making the assessment under Article 8 of
    the  ECHR  the  panel  concluded  that  his  removal   would   not   be
    disproportionate.

The grounds of appeal and my assessment

 9. I turn now to the grounds of appeal.  The first  ground  relates  to  a
    contention that the panel failed to take into account the reasons  that
    the appellant does not  have  a  close  relationship  with  his  father
    including the circumstances of his parents'  separation,  his  father's
    alcohol abuse, and domestic abuse of his mother to whom  the  appellant
    is very close.  It is contended that the panel failed to consider  this
    evidence which is said to be  highly  relevant  to  the  assessment  of
    whether he has a relationship with his father that amounts to  ties  to
    Ghana for the purposes of the rules.

10. Mr Norton, in summary, submitted that the panel  had  taken  everything
    into account in their assessment and there was no error of law in their
    decision.  This clearly was a fundamental aspect of the appeal  because
    of paragraph 399A of HC  395  (as  amended).   399A(b)  refers  to  the
    question of a person having  no  ties  including  social,  cultural  or
    family with the country to which he would have to  go  if  required  to
    leave the UK.  That aspect of the rules was considered in the  case  of
    Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060  (IAC).   To
    summarise, the Upper Tribunal concluded that the meaning of  'no  ties'
    does not literally mean no ties. The  word  'ties'  imports  a  concept
    involving something more than merely  remote or abstract links  to  the
    country of proposed removal.   It  involves  there  being  a  continued
    connection to life in that country, something that ties a  claimant  to
    his or her country of origin (see [123]).  Were it otherwise a person's
    nationality in relation to the proposed deportation  destination  would
    itself lead to a failure to meet the requirements of the rules.

11. In my brief summary of the findings of the First-tier Tribunal I  refer
    to some of the evidence that it took into account in the conclusion  to
    the effect that the appellant had not established that he had no  ties.
    It is well established that a Tribunal is not required to set out every
    aspect of the evidence that has been taken into account.  The  Tribunal
    in this  case  was  plainly  aware  of  the  contents  of  the  witness
    statements. This is illustrated, for example, by the reference  at  [6]
    to the appellant's written statement which states that he had never had
    a close relationship with his father and that it was his mother who had
    played the most important role in raising him.  Whatever is said  about
    the basis of the appellant's parents' separation, I am  satisfied  that
    the First-tier Tribunal  gave  clear  reasons  for  not  accepting  the
    evidence of the remoteness or lack of relationship between them.

12. The evidence from his witness statement and oral evidence,  and  indeed
    the evidence of his sister, is to the effect  that  the  appellant  did
    not, and does not, want  to  build  a  relationship  with  his  father.
    However, the panel in effect found that that was  inconsistent  with  a
    significant sum of  money  that  was  promised  to  the  appellant  and
    accepted by him in relation to the furtherance  of  his  studies.   The
    panel rejected the conclusion that that was money that was paid more by
    way of a business transaction.

13. It is suggested that the panel did not explain why they concluded  that
    the witnesses had exaggerated their  evidence  about  the  relationship
    between the appellant's father and the  appellant  himself  and/or  his
    sister.  However,  it  is  clear  from  the  determination  that   that
    conclusion was reached with reference to the evidence  that  they  took
    into account, for example the loan, and the  evidence  in  relation  to
    phone calls showing  that  there  was  contact  on  occasions  such  as
    Christmas and birthdays. At [20] it was concluded that it  was  in  the
    appellant's own interest to play down the  level  of  contact  for  the
    purposes of the appeal.

14. It is also relevant to mention in this respect that the panel took into
    account not only the visits that had been  made  for  the  purposes  of
    family funerals, but also the evidence of Aaron Mensah who they said it
    appears visited Ghana with the appellant in 2011, partly  for  business
    purposes because Mr Mensah thought it would be a  good  experience  for
    the appellant because he  was  seen  as  a  potential  employee  of  Mr
    Mensah's company.  So, aside from contact  with  his  father  that  was
    further evidence of connections with Ghana.

15. I am satisfied that  the  panel  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant does have realistic and viable family links with Ghana.

16. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there is any merit in the  grounds
    which seek to  challenge  this  aspect  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination.

17. So far as concerns the discrete point about a telephone  call  made  by
    the appellant's father to the appellant's sister in December 2013, I do
    not interpret the panel as having concluded that it was  the  appellant
    who received that phone call.  At  [20]  the  panel  stated  that  "the
    Appellant's sister said that the last contact she had with  her  father
    was at Christmas 2013 and we find on the evidence that there  has  been
    more contact than the Appellant is prepared to admit".  As I say, I  do
    not interpret that aspect of the determination as  an  indication  that
    the panel concluded that the appellant was the  one  who  received  the
    call because it seems he was in custody at the time. The  call  to  the
    appellant's sister  was  nevertheless  a  matter  that  the  panel  was
    entitled to take into account in the overall assessment of whether,  or
    of the extent to which, the children were in contact with their father.
    But even if it could be said that there is  an  error  in  the  panel's
    appreciation of the facts in this regard, is not an error of fact  that
    amounts to an error of law, still less one that requires  the  decision
    to be set aside.

18. Ground 3 concerns the panel's assessment of Article 8 with reference to
    the decision in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39.  That  was  a  decision  in
    relation to the extent to which a judge or Tribunal needs to take  into
    account the effect of removal on third parties.  It is  said  that  the
    panel in this case did not have any, or any sufficient, regard  to  the
    effect on the appellant and his  sister  of  the  appellant's  removal.
    Reference is  made  to  the  witness  statements  in  which  they  give
    expression to their feelings  of  emotion  were  the  appellant  to  be
    removed.  At [28] of the  determination  the  panel  stated  that  they
    accepted that the appellant has a quite large family circle in  the  UK
    but that he is an adult and the relationship that  he  has  established
    with the family circle is one of an adult.

19. At [30] this finding was further refined in that the panel stated  that
    the  only  aspect  of  family  life  that  exists  is  the  appellant's
    relationship with his adult family members  in  the  UK,  going  on  to
    conclude that there was no evidence of any  special  dependency  beyond
    the normal emotional ties that exist between adult family  members.  It
    was concluded that that was not sufficient for the appellant to succeed
    under  Article  8  and  of  course  that  was  a  recognition  of   the
    jurisprudence in terms of the extent  to  which  relationships  between
    adult family members amounts in law to family life.

20. Plainly, the panel was aware of the appellant's relationship  with  his
    sister and his mother although it does not seem to me  that  the  panel
    gave that expression in terms of a conclusion that that was an  element
    of the appellant's private life.  Whilst there  was  indeed  no  direct
    reference to the impact on those  family  members  of  the  appellant's
    removal, I am not satisfied that if it was an error of law, it was  one
    that could have affected the outcome of the appeal given the assessment
    by the panel of the public interest, the seriousness of the offence for
    which he was convicted and the  fact  that  this  was  a  private  life
    consideration which was not involving family life between, for example,
    a minor and adult family members.  In an appropriate case such an error
    could be argued to have had a sufficient  impact  on  the  decision  to
    require the decision to be set aside.  That in my judgment is  not  the
    case here and if it is an error of law it is not one  that  could  have
    affected the outcome of the appeal.

21. In all these circumstances, I am not satisfied that any of the  grounds
    advanced for suggesting that the panel erred in law  have  merit.   The
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal to  dismiss  the  appeal  therefore
    stands.

22. Before concluding this judgment I record my thanks to both parties  for
    their very helpful, succinct and clear submissions.
