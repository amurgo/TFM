For the Appellant:     Mrs H. Pryce, Counsel instructed by Morgan Mark
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P. Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The first-named appellant  ('the  appellant  ')  and  her  dependent
       husband and their two children are all citizens of  India  appealing
       against the decisions of the respondent of  2  and  16  August  2013
       refusing to grant them leave to remain under the  Tier  1  (General)
       Migrant provisions of the Points Based System. The  appellant  first
       entered the United Kingdom on 15 May 2006 with entry clearance as  a
       student which was subsequently extended to permit study as a student
       nurse and thereafter as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  until  22  June
       2013. A further application was made but refused on 16  August  2013
       accompanied by removal directions under  s.47  of  the  Immigration,
       Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 upon which the respondent no  longer
       seeks to rely.


    2. The  substantive  refusal  under  the  Rules  was  restricted  to  a
       challenge in relation to her claim for 40 points  on  the  basis  of
       previous earnings. The respondent awarded the  appellant  35  points
       but this was some five points short  of  the  overall  total  of  80
       required. The appellant claimed earnings  of  ï¿½65,000  odd  for  the
       period 1 December 2011 to 13 November 2013 during which  period  she
       was on maternity leave from 10 December  2012  until  10  May  2013.
       Wrongly, the respondent claimed a payslip of November 2011  was  not
       within 12 months the subject of the claim and therefore  could  not,
       according to the respondent, be included. The reality was  that  the
       appellant did not include a November 2011 payslip and made no  claim
       based upon the submission of such a payslip. The  only  intelligible
       inference is that the decision maker was looking at the payslip  for
       November 2012 which the appellant did submit.  The  respondent  also
       alleged that the payslips from January 2013 to 26  April  2013  were
       payslips within the dates the appellant was claiming  deferment  due
       to maternity leave.

    3. Doubtless these were complex provisions which few understood. In the
       First-tier Tribunal, Judge Malins in a determination promulgated  on
       11 April 2014, concluded that the appellant had failed to  discharge
       the burden of proof in relation to employment or self-employment and
       that he did not believe the appellant worked the hours claimed in  a
       year during which she gave birth. He did  not  accept  private  care
       appointments would have resulted in payment in cash or that her work
       could be  classified  as  that  of  a  highly  skilled  migrant.  He
       concluded: "By a wide margin,  the  first  appellant's  appeal  must
       fail".

    4. Unsurprisingly, the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal asserted
       that the sole basis of  the  respondent's  refusal  related  to  the
       appellant's previous earnings for which she was  awarded  35  points
       and not 40.

    5. When the matter came before me on 4 August  2014  I  was  unable  to
       determine  what  requirements  within  the  Immigration  Rules   the
       appellant was expected to meet  and  for  what  period  or  how  the
       appellant  alleged  those  requirements  were  met.  Accordingly,  I
       provided the directions that are set out in  the  Appendix  to  this
       determination.


    6. In apparent compliance with those directions, the appellant provided
       a document in narrative  form,  making  apparent  reference  to  all
       relevant documents as to how she claimed the requirements  were  met
       in order  to  score  40  points.  Unfortunately,  in  breach  of  my
       directions, the respondent failed  to  respond  to  the  appellant's
       narrative nor did she set out  which  parts  of  the  narrative  she
       accepted, which parts she rejected and  her  reasons.  Nor  did  the
       response set out whether the Secretary of State accepted the  First-
       tier Tribunal erred in law in approaching the appeal  as  the  Judge
       did.

    7. By this narrative process, it would become possible  to  reveal  how
       the respondent erred in refusing the application and, therefore, how
       the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred.   Those claims  and  assertions
       have not been answered by the respondent and, short  of  seeking  an
       adjournment (which Mr Deller did not pursue), there is  no  reasoned
       challenge to the appellant's claim.

    8. There is nothing within the submissions made by the appellant  which
       permit me to approach them critically or entitle me to reject them.

    9. The fact is that the Secretary of State has not provided a challenge
       to the  detailed  grounds  which  have  now  been  advanced  by  the
       appellant. I am far from suggesting that a failure to comply with  a
       direction operates as  an  automatic  bar  to  the  respondent  from
       challenging the appellant's case. There will be many instances where
       the public interest in refusing the  claim  will  far  outweigh  the
       disadvantage to the appellant in being unable to  benefit  from  the
       respondent's failure. Thus, in the  case  of  a  deportation  appeal
       involving a serious  offender  sentenced  to  a  lengthy  period  of
       imprisonment, the failure of the Secretary of State to comply with a
       direction will  almost  certainly  not  result  in  the  appellant's
       challenge to the deportation decision  succeeding  for  that  reason
       alone. There will, however, be other cases where the public interest
       is much more limited. In such a  case,  it  may  be  appropriate  to
       prevent the respondent from advancing a challenge to the appellant's
       claim in breach of directions made against the Secretary of State.

   10.  I cannot gainsay that the appellant has satisfied the  requirements
       of the Immigration Rules.  The appeal should succeed for that reason
       alone. There is  therefore  no  public  interest  in  relieving  the
       respondent of  the  consequences  of  his  failure  to  comply  with
       directions.

   11. At the conclusion of  the  hearing,  Mr  Deller  on  behalf  of  the
       respondent, proposed that he withdraw the decision and committed the
       respondent to remake it in terms that the appellant would be granted
       leave to remain.  Whilst this proposal  acknowledges  that  (a)  the
       appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules and (b)  the
       decision challenged in  the  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  was  not  in
       accordance with the law and (c) the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred
       in law in dismissing the appeal, I see no  reason  in  law  why  the
       Upper Tribunal should not acknowledge these matters by allowing  the
       appeal here and now.  I do not doubt Mr Deller's good faith  in  the
       course he has proposed or the fact that,  in  carrying  through  the
       proposal, he would then commit the Secretary of  State  to  granting
       leave in accordance with his proposal.  My view may well  have  been
       different if the respondent had written to the Upper Tribunal before
       the hearing that the decision had been withdrawn and  the  appellant
       had been granted the  leave  sought  in  the  application.   In  the
       circumstances, Mr Deller's proposal was in essence a  withdrawal  of
       the respondent's case, rather than a  withdrawal  of  the  decision.
       Indeed, that course of action was thrust upon him by reason  of  his
       being unable to pursue a challenge given the failure to comply  with
       the directions which had offered the respondent  an  opportunity  to
       articulate a challenge fully and intelligibly.  In particular,  Rule
       17(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 requires
       both a notice of withdrawal to be provided on notice  prior  to  the
       hearing and the Upper  Tribunal's  consent,  neither  of  which  has
       occurred.

DECISION

    The Judge made an error on a point of law and I re-make the decision in
    the following terms:


        The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.
