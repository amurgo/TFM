                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

INTRODUCTION

 1. The origins of this appeal lie in the decision of the  Respondent,  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department ("the Secretary of  State"),
    dated 20 August 2014, to make a deportation order  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant,  a  national  of  Nigeria  aged  15  years.   The  Appellant
    appealed, unsuccessfully, to the First-tier Tribunal  (the  "FtT")  and
    now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

IMMIGRATION HISTORY

 2. This is as follows:

    (a)  The Appellant asserts that he entered the United Kingdom in  March
         1986 and, qua dependant of his parents, was granted leave to remain
         expiring on 31 October 1988.

    (b)  Between December  1988  and  April  1992  the  Appellant  was  the
         beneficiary of successive finite grants of leave to remain.

    (c)  On 07 April 1990 the Appellant was  granted  indefinite  leave  to
         remain in the UK.

    (d)  On 30 August 2000 the Appellant was  convicted  of  possessing  an
         offensive weapon and an offence of dishonesty, punished by monetary
         orders totalling some �85.00 and a conditional discharge.

    (e)  On 05 January 2004,  the  Appellant  was  convicted,  having  been
         prosecuted on  indictment,  of  resisting  or  obstructing  arrest,
         possessing Class A Heroin, handling stolen  goods  and  failing  to
         surrender to bail, giving rise to an 80 hour  community  punishment
         order, a 12 month community rehabilitation  order  and  a  3  month
         curfew order.

    (f)  On  12  March  2004,  the  Appellant  was  convicted,  again  upon
         indictment, of 17 counts of supplying Class A heroin and one  count
         of supplying Class B cannabis, punished  by  4  years  imprisonment
         concurrently.

    (g)   On  11  September   2004,   the   Appellant's   application   for
         naturalisation (made in June 2003) was refused on the ground of bad
         character.

    (h)  On 14 April 2009 the Appellant was convicted of battery,  punished
         by a community order requiring unpaid  work  of  200  hours  and  a
         compensation order of �300, together with costs of �200.

      i) On 14 February 2011 the Appellant's community order was varied to a
         community residence order of 7 days and he was convicted of failing
         to comply with the earlier order.

    (j)  On 13  April  2011  the  Appellant  was  convicted  of  possessing
         cannabis and cannabis resin, punished by modest monetary orders.

    (k)  On  30  July  2011  the  Appellant  was  again  convicted  of  the
         aforementioned offence, punished  by  a  fine  of  �100,  a  victim
         surcharge of �15 and costs of �85.

    (l)  On 22 November 2011 the Appellant was convicted again of the  same
         offence, receiving a 6 month community order entailing unpaid  work
         and activity requirements, together with costs of �85.

    (m)  On 24 March 2012 a child was born of the  Appellant's  partner  in
         the United Kingdom.

    (n)  On 09 April 2013 the Appellant was punished by concurrent fines of
         �50 in respect of two further counts  of  possessing  cannabis  and
         cannabis resin and failing to surrender to custody.

    (o)  On 26  April  2013  the  Appellant  was  sentenced  to  a  further
         community order and ordered to pay  �60  compensation  having  been
         convicted of destroying or damaging property.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S DECISION

 3. On 02 June 2014 the Appellant received the customary 'minded to deport'
    notification. In his response, dated 20 June 2014,  he  made  the  case
    that to deport him would be unlawful  as  it  would  infringe  his  and
    other's rights under Article 8 ECHR, contrary to section 6 of the Human
    Rights Act 1998.

 4. The deportation decision, having rehearsed the Appellant's  immigration
    and criminal histories, followed by a number  of  general  policy  type
    statements,  contains   a   section   entitled   "Metropolitan   Police
    Intelligence".  The essence of what follows may be discerned  from  the
    following extracts:

         "Evidence has been submitted by the Metropolitan Police which  adds
         further weight to arguments in favour of a decision to deport  you.
         The Secretary of State concludes that  this  evidence  demonstrates
         that your presence in the United Kingdom is not  conducive  to  the
         public good ...

         In addition to your  criminal  record  of  10  convictions  for  32
         offences, the MG11 shows a further  3  non-convictions  between  04
         September 2009 and 10 June 2011.  These non-convictions  relate  to
         money laundering and  possession  of  cannabis,  kidnap  and  false
         imprisonment and common assault.  Full details of  these  incidents
         can be found in the MG11 ....

         It is evident from the MG11 provided  by  the  Metropolitan  Police
         that you are a man who is not on the fringes of criminality, but is
         actively engaged  in  a  criminal  lifestyle  whose  behaviour  and
         associations cause serious risk to innocent individuals ....

         It is clear that you were actively involved  in  drug  dealing  [in
         2003] and you probably still are."

         [Emphasis added.]

    It is common case that "MG11"  is  a  compilation  emanating  from  the
    Metropolitan Police and, further, that a copy of this was  attached  to
    the decision letter.

 5. The decision maker then considered the  Appellant's  Article  8  claim,
    noting that this was based on the existence of his daughter,  aged  two
    years, born to his former partner.  Under the rubric  "very  compelling
    circumstances", the decision maker, having noted the  legal  rule  that
    the public interest required the Appellant's deportation "unless  there
    are very compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
    the exceptions to deportation set out at paragraphs 399 and 399A of the
    Immigration Rules", continues:

         "In order to outweigh  the  very  significant  public  interest  in
         deporting you, you would need to provide evidence of a very  strong
         Article 8 claim, over and above the circumstances described in  the
         exceptions to deportation.  You have failed to provide evidence  of
         a very strong Article 8 claim."

    It was  concluded,  accordingly,  that  very  compelling  circumstances
    sufficient to out weigh the public interest in deporting the  Appellant
    had not been demonstrated.

DECISION OF THE FtT

 6. The appeal was conducted  on  the  basis  that  since  the  Appellant's
    sentence of four years imprisonment pre-dated the UK Borders Act  2007,
    the automatic deportation provisions of the latter were not engaged and
    the question was whether under section 3(5) of the Immigration Act 1971
    his deportation  would  be  conducive  to  the  public  good.   It  was
    submitted on the Appellant's behalf that he is a reformed character and
    that his drugs offences  were  mainly  stimulated  by  his  dependency.
    Certain  aspects  of  other  offences  documented  in  the  Appellant's
    criminal record were disputed by him.   The  absence  of  any  negative
    reoffending assessment was highlighted. The Appellant  presented  as  a
    person who is employed, is self sufficient and supports his  child  and
    step son.  Finally, it was claimed that he has  no  enduring  links  to
    Nigeria.

 7. The decision of the FtT contains the following  damming  assessment  of
    the Appellant's veracity:

         "...  We did not find him  to  be  credible.   We  found  that  his
         evidence contained many inconsistencies and when dealing  with  his
         responses to the matters contained  within  the  CRIS  reports,  we
         found his evidence to be highly implausible and not consistent with
         the matters recorded therein and we did not accept his  explanation
         of the matters ...

         We  were  not  satisfied  that  we  were  able  to  rely  upon  the
         Appellant's evidence or that of the other live witnesses  as  being
         the truth of the matters that they gave evidence about."

    The other "live" witnesses were  the  Appellant's  mother,  sister  and
    current girlfriend.  The above passage in the determination is followed
    by a series of supporting particulars.   For  the  reasons  given,  the
    Tribunal disbelieved the Appellant's several claims relating to aspects
    of both  his  offending  and  his  soi-disant  "non-convictions".   The
    decision also contains reasoned grounds for rejecting  the  Appellant's
    claims about the depth of his relationship with his daughter  and  step
    son, giving rise to the omnibus conclusion:

         "..  We are unable to accept that he has significant involvement in
         their lives."

    The Tribunal made a further, discrete finding that the Appellant is not
    in a genuine or subsisting relationship with the  person  presented  as
    his current girlfriend.

 8. In its conclusions, the FtT pronounced itself satisfied, on the balance
    of  probabilities,  of  both  the  Appellant's  convictions  and   "the
    allegations of conduct",  clearly  referring  to  the  so-called  "non-
    convictions".  Next, the Tribunal concluded that the  Appellant's  case
    is embraced by paragraph 398(a) of the Immigration  Rules,  as  he  had
    been sentenced to 4 years imprisonment in 2004, has  had  a  string  of
    further convictions subsequently and  "...   still  remains  unable  to
    accept responsibility for some of his previous actions ...".  Next, the
    Tribunal expressed its assessment that "... there is a real  likelihood
    that he will reoffend".  This is followed by the overall conclusion:

         "On the facts established, viewed as a whole, we are satisfied that
         he is a persistent offender and that his conduct has reached such a
         level of seriousness as to justify a decision to deport and we find
         that deportation is conducive to the public good."

    The Tribunal then made the following further discrete conclusions:

    (i)  Deportation of the Appellant is harmonious with the  Secretary  of
         State's policy, currently reflected in  the  relevant  Home  Office
         Immigration Directorate Instruction.

    (ii) If paragraph 399 or 399A of the Rules  had  been  applicable,  the
         Appellant would not have satisfied either.

    (iii)    Further, and in any event, very compelling circumstances  over
         and above those specified in paragraphs 399 and 399A had  not  been
         demonstrated.

    (iv) The Appellant is not currently employed, despite his claim to  the
         contrary.

    The appeal was dismissed accordingly.

APPEAL TO THIS TRIBUNAL

 9. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on  all  of  the
    grounds advanced, with varying degrees of enthusiasm.  We dismantle the
    extensive grounds of appeal thus:

      a) There are three complaints of procedural unfairness.

      b) The FtT failed to apply the correct provisions of  the  Immigration
         Rules.

      c) Certain findings and conclusions of the  FtT  are  contaminated  by
         irrationality and/or inadequate reasoning and/or a failure to  take
         into account material evidence.

    We shall address each of the grounds, thus condensed, seriatim.

Procedural Unfairness

10. The three complaints of procedural unfairness are:

      a) The members of the FtT  panel  were  informed  in  advance  of  the
         hearing of the planned arrest of  the  Appellant  at  the  Tribunal
         premises upon completion of the hearing.  It is  common  case  that
         the panel members were indeed thus informed and did not declare  to
         either party their possession of this information.

      b) At an early stage of the day when a delay  in  the  hearing  became
         necessary in the  interests  of  fairness  to  the  Appellant,  the
         judicial member of the panel expressed his anxiety that the hearing
         be completed within the day in question in view  of  his  impending
         retirement from service.

      c) It is asserted by the Appellant that the so-called  "Nexus"  bundle
         of documents was first served on his representatives on the morning
         of the hearing.

11. We consider that the first complaint of procedural unfairness falls  to
    be determined by the application of the appearance of  bias  principle.
    The governing principles have been reviewed by this  Tribunal  recently
    in Alubankudi (Appearance of bias) [2015] UKUT 542 (IAC), at [6] - [8].
     In short, the question to be addressed  is  whether  the  hypothetical
    reasonable, balanced and properly informed observer would consider that
    possession of the information in question predisposed the panel  to  an
    adverse view of the Appellant's appeal, to the extent  that  they  were
    biased against him.  The observer, in evaluating this issue, would take
    into account, inter alia, what the  lay  member  has  said  about  this
    issue, when alerted to it subsequently:

         "Thinking back, I can recall the clerk making a comment  about  the
         Appellant being arrested for non-payment  of  fines  and  something
         about it being agreed that it would occur after the hearing  ...  I
         had understood it to be a general observation of  why  the  parties
         had not been ready to proceed ... [this] was not something that  we
         would or did give any weight to or place any reliance upon ...

         During the hearing ... there was  no  reference  to  the  Appellant
         having failed to pay any fines and we didn't think any more  of  it
         ...  It was not a matter discussed in our post-hearing discussions,
         which concentrated on the evidence that we  had  had  ...   and  no
         further thought had been given to it."

    The hypothetical observer would, in our judgment, draw much reassurance
    from this account.  He would also take into account the knowledge which
    the panel had, without objection from any quarter, of matters seriously
    adverse to the Appellant, in particular his serial offending  during  a
    period of some 13 years, rehearsed in [2]  above.  The  observer  would
    further bear in mind that the panel were possessed  of  the  additional
    damaging material  contained  in  the  "Nexus"  bundle.   The  ultimate
    question for the observer would be whether the panel was subconsciously
    predisposed against the Appellant by virtue of its  possession  of  the
    impending   arrest   information.    Drawing   together   the   various
    ingredients, we are satisfied that the hypothetical observer would have
    no reservations about the fairness and impartiality of the adjudicating
    panel.

12. We turn to examine the second element of this ground. Every  litigant's
    right to a fair and unbiased  hearing  attracts  the  protection  of  a
    series of principles which are well known.  Citation  of  authority  is
    unnecessary for this purpose.  We accept, in the abstract,  that  if  a
    hearing were hurried and compressed to the extent that a  litigant  did
    not have a reasonable opportunity to present and argue this case such a
    hearing would be unfair and, hence, unlawful.   Having  considered  the
    evidence in its totality, we are  entirely  satisfied  that  the  first
    instance hearing was, in this respect,  conducted  in  accordance  with
    appropriate standards.   We are thus satisfied having considered in its
     totality the evidence bearing on this discrete issue,  which  includes
    the account of Counsel representing the Appellant,  from  which  it  is
    abundantly clear that the fairness of the Appellant's hearing was in no
    way compromised.  We have also  considered  the  response  of  the  lay
    member of the panel who states, with reference to the presiding Judge:

         "... At the start of the hearing [he] told the representatives that
         if it was felt that there was a risk that the matter would go  part
         heard or may require a second day,  then  they  were  to  tell  the
         Tribunal as it would have to be adjourned ... due to his  impending
         retirement."

    We note that this is unchallenged by the  Appellant's  former  Counsel.
    We also take into account the lay member's impressively detailed  notes
    of the hearing, which  confirm  that  evidence  was  adduced  from  the
    Appellant  and  four  witnesses  and  submissions  were  made  by  both
    representatives at the conclusion. We can find no reason not to  accept
    the lay member's account.  There is no merit in this ground.

13. Thirdly, and finally, the Appellant complains that the fairness of  his
    hearing at first instance was impaired by the failure of the  Secretary
    of State's representatives  to  serve  the  "Nexus"  bundle  until  the
    morning of the hearing. His post-hearing witness statement contains the
    following passage:

         "The Nexus bundle was only served that morning and my barrister was
         only given 40 minutes to go through it during which the court clerk
         twice interrupted to find out if we were ready to  proceed  as  the
         Judge was still [sic] waiting to come in.  In order to appease  the
         Judge, my barrister urged us to go ahead into the hearing."

    We take into account that the Appellant  has  an  obvious  interest  in
    making a self-serving claim  of  this  nature.  We  further  take  into
    account the withering  rejection  of  his  veracity  generally  in  the
    determination of the FtT.  Thirdly, and finally, we have had regard  to
    the detailed written account of the Appellant's former Counsel.   This,
    on  its  own,  confounds   the   Appellant's   assertions   decisively.
    Furthermore, we have no hesitation in preferring Counsel's  account  to
    the very brief suggestion made in writing by the Appellant's solicitors
    long after the event.

14. We reject the procedural unfairness ground accordingly.  In  doing  so,
    we take the opportunity to commend the Appellant's former Counsel  for,
    firstly, clearly being aware of and appreciating the decision  of  this
    Tribunal in BW (Witness Statements by Advocates) [2014] UKUT 568 (IAC),
    which makes clear that a person who has  represented  an  appellant  at
    first instance cannot continue to do so on appeal in  a  case  of  this
    kind.  Second, the Appellant's former Counsel has, assiduously and to a
    high professional standard, provided a detailed, balanced and  measured
    written account of all material events at the first hearing.

The Operative Provisions of the Immigration Rules

15. The second ground of appeal involves the contention that the FtT  erred
    in law  by  applying  the  post  -  10  July  2015  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules rather than their predecessor.  Unsurprisingly,  this
    ground was advanced rather faintly, having regard to  the  decision  of
    the Court of Appeal in YM (Uganda) - v -  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1292
    which, in our view, renders this contention  unarguable.   We  consider
    further and in any event that the Appellant would have been  unable  to
    satisfy the more relaxed, benign provisions of the Rules in vogue prior
    to the operative date.

The Challenge to Assorted findings

16. Finally the determination is challenged on the ground that the Tribunal
    made certain irrational findings and/or failed to give adequate reasons
    and/or left out of account certain evidence.  It is incumbent  on  this
    Tribunal to consider the determination as a whole, taking into  account
    that there is no obligation upon a fact finding  Tribunal  to  rehearse
    all of the evidence available to it.  Having  considered  the  discrete
    complaints which have been advanced under this heading we have come  to
    the confident conclusion, applying the governing principles,  that  the
    various  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  challenge  are
    unimpeachable.  They withstand challenge by reference  to  the  various
    ways in which the appeal is put:  irrationality,  inadequate  reasoning
    and leaving out of account certain evidence.  We emphasise, as  we  did
    during the  hearing,  that  this  challenge,  in  essence,  entails  an
    elevated threshold for the Appellant and also requires this Tribunal to
    take into account the totality of the determination and  in  particular
    the various findings adverse to the Appellant's credibility.

OMNIBUS CONCLUSION

17. The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.


                                                                       [pic]

                                                     Dated:  03 October 2015
