For the Appellants:          Mr I. Khan, Counsel instructed by direct
access
For the Respondent:    Mr K. Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all nationals of Pakistan. They are  respectively  a
    mother and her four children. HAQ is today aged 21, MBQ is 16, MQ is 15
    and AQ is 12.  On the 20th April 2016 the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Coutts)  dismissed  their  linked  appeals  against  the   Respondent's
    decisions to refuse to vary their  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights
    grounds and to remove them from the UK under s47 of Immigration, Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  The Appellants were  granted  permission  to
    appeal against that decision on the 3rd  March  2017  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Chapman.




    Anonymity


 2. There is no reason why the identity of the adult Appellants  should  be
    protected. The case does however turn on the  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom of the three minor Appellants. I have had regard to Rule 14  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013:  Anonymity  Orders.  I  am  concerned  that
    identification of the adult Appellants could lead to identification  of
    children involved and I therefore consider it appropriate  to  make  an
    order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"






    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The crux of this case is the family life that the Appellants all  share
    in the UK with a Mr IAQ. IAQ is the husband of the first Appellant, and
    the father of the children.  He has lived in the United Kingdom for  at
    least 11 years and was granted indefinite leave to remain on  the  20th
    December 2014.    The family sought leave to  remain  pursuant  to  the
    provisions of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, and  failing  that,
    placed reliance on Article 8 'outside of the  rules'.  Their  case  was
    that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  in
    Pakistan, and/or in the alternative that  their  removal  from  the  UK
    today would be a disproportionate  interference  with  their  right  to
    family life.     The  Appellants  further  relied  upon  the  provision
    relating to private life, paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules.
    They submitted that three of the children had lived  for  a  continuous
    period of more than  seven  years  in  the  UK  and  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect them to leave.   MI and HAQ argued that they faced
    very significant obstacles to their integration in Pakistan; these were
    the same factual matters relied upon  in  respect  of  the  case  under
    Appendix FM, namely that the  family  would  face  very  severe  socio-
    economic hardship and would in effect be destitute.


 4. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal were:


        a) There were not very significant obstacles to either of the adult
           appellants re-establishing themselves in Pakistan;


        b) It was not unreasonable to expect the younger children to  leave
           the UK;

        c) The process of resettlement may involve some  hardship  for  the
           family but there were not insurmountable obstacles  facing  them
           in Pakistan;

        d) The claims all failed under the rules;

        e) In the circumstances it was not disproportionate to expect  this
           family to leave the UK.


 5. The Appellants now appeal on the ground that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to take material evidence/submissions into account  in  reaching
    its conclusions.  In granting permission Judge  Chapman  considered  it
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal had erred, in particular  in  its
    approach to the position of the three children, who at the date of  the
    appeal had been in the UK for approaching ten years.




    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings


 6. The chronology of relevant events is as follows:


    2004         IAQ comes to UK on a student visa. Subsequently varied  to
    be
                 granted leave as a work permit holder


    31.5.2006    MI and three younger children join IAQ as his dependents


    31.1.07            MI and three younger children  all  granted  further
    leave


    10.4.08            MI and three younger children  all  granted  further
    leave


    16.3.09            MI and three younger children  all  granted  further
    leave


    3.10.09      MI and three younger children all  granted  further  leave
                 until 3.10.14


    12.6.11            HAQ enters the country with leave to  enter  as  the
    dependent of
                 IAQ


    3.10.14            Applications lodged for further leave to remain


    4.5.15       Respondent refuses to vary leave in  all  five  cases  and
    makes
                 directions for the appellants' removal pursuant to s47


    14.3.16            Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal


    20.4.16            First-tier Tribunal decision




    Before me the Respondent accepted that all of the Appellants  have  had
    valid leave to enter or  remain  since  their  arrival.  By  virtue  of
    section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 all five will continue  to  have
    lawful leave at least until these proceedings are finally determined.


 7. The First-tier Tribunal was required to first consider whether  any  of
    the appeals before it could succeed with reference to  the  Immigration
    Rules, and if not whether the Respondent's decisions were  nevertheless
    a disproportionate, and thus unlawful, interference with the Article  8
    rights of the individuals concerned.


 8. It was not immediately clear from the face  of  the  determination  why
    neither MI nor any of her minor children would be able to succeed  with
    reference to the rules relating to partners and  children  in  Appendix
    FM. IAQ had settled status at the date of the applications,  there  was
    no dispute as to the relationships involved,  all  the  applicants  had
    valid leave to remain at the date of the applications and it  is  noted
    at paragraph 21 of the determination that  the  HOPO  on  the  day  had
    accepted IAQ's earnings to be in excess of �37,000, "above the required
    income threshold to support a partner and children".   The  answer  was
    revealed  by  a  letter  dated  3rd  October  2014  which  covered  the
    applications for further leave to remain[1].  This indicated  that  the
    applications were being made under Article 8 'outside  of  the  rules',
    the reason being that at the date of application  IAQ's  earnings  were
    not sufficient to meet the threshold imposed in Appendix FM (Mr  Khan's
    instructions were that they were then in  the  region  of  �26,000  per
    annum).




    276ADE(1)(vi)


 9.  The  First-tier  Tribunal's  determination  started  then   with   the
    provisions relating to private life, as they applied  to  MI,  and  her
    adult son HAQ, who was at  the  date  of  the  hearing  aged  20.   The
    relevant provision was that at paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  rules,
    which required the Appellants to show that there were "very significant
    obstacles" to their integration in Pakistan.
10. The Tribunal found that both of these adults can speak Urdu, that  they
    had both spent most of their lives in  Pakistan,  that  they  know  and
    understand the culture and that they have close relatives  in  Karachi.
    The Tribunal accepted that return to Pakistan would be  disruptive  and
    difficult but on balance did not consider the high  test  in  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) to be met.


11. Mr Khan takes issue with those  conclusions  on  the  ground  that  the
    Tribunal failed to take into account the submissions made to the effect
    that the family would face destitution if returned to  Pakistan,  where
    they would have no home, jobs or support.   I  reject  this  ground  as
    unarguable. Setting aside any legal  argument  about  whether  economic
    hardship might qualify as a "very  significant  obstacle"  there  would
    have been no evidential foundation for the Tribunal  to  have  accepted
    these submissions. Both adult Appellants are healthy and able to  work,
    they have close family members to whom they could turn and failing that
    IAQ would be able to support them with remittances  from  the  UK.   In
    respect of the close family members in  Pakistan,  the  Tribunal  noted
    that IAQ and  MI  have  two  adult  daughters  living  there;  Mr  Khan
    contended that it was an error for the Tribunal to have weighed that in
    the balance where both women have outstanding  applications  for  entry
    clearance to join the family here. This point too is unarguable. At the
    date of the appeal these daughters  remained  in  Pakistan  where  they
    lived in their grandparents home.  It is difficult  to  see  how  their
    possible future absence from Pakistan could present either  HAQ  or  MI
    with an obstacle to their integration.

12. I find  there  to  be  no  error  of  law  in  the  approach  taken  to
    276ADE(1)(vi).





    276ADE(1)(iv)


13. Having considered the position of  the  adults  under  the  rules,  the
    Tribunal turned to consider the position of the children, at  the  date
    of the appeal before it aged 15, 14 and  11.    The  relevant  rule  in
    these cases was paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) which required  the  applicants
    to demonstrate that they have lived in the UK for a  continuous  period
    of at least seven years, and that it would not be reasonable to  expect
    them to leave the UK. The  first  limb  was  not  in  issue,  it  being
    accepted that these children had been brought to the UK in May 2006. At
    the date of the appeal they had therefore been living here  for  almost
    ten years.

14. The reasoning is found at paragraph 36:

         "These appellants, being the younger children of the  family  here,
         followed their mother [MI] to join their father [IAQ], here in  May
         2006. It is therefore not  unreasonable  that  they  should  follow
         their mother when she returns to Pakistan and they can,  of  course
         be joined at the same time  by  their  father  and  their  brother,
         Hamza. They will also have the support of  their  grandparents  and
         two sisters who remain in Karachi and who will be  able  to  assist
         them with readjusting back to life in Pakistan.  They  speak  Urdu,
         there is no  reason  to  believe  that  upon  attending  school  in
         Pakistan that they cannot continue to obtain the achievement levels
         that they have shown at school here. I note that  [AQ],  the  fifth
         appellant, is currently in her last year of primary school; however
         it do not consider this to be a significant issue as  the  family's
         return to Pakistan is likely to take place after  the  end  of  her
         current school year".

15. Mr Norton contended that these were all good reasons to find  that  the
    children's removal would be reasonable and asked that the  findings  be
    upheld. I agree that the factors considered were all relevant, but I am
    unable to uphold the overall  finding.  That  is  because  the  factors
    identified are not the only relevant matters that the  Tribunal  should
    have weighed in the balance. The fact that these children had lived  in
    the UK for more than seven years was relevant not  only  to  the  first
    limb of sub-paragraph (1)(iv) of the rule, but it played a role in  the
    second, since it served to illustrate the strength and depth  of  their
    individual private lives here.

16. The genesis of the 'seven year' provision was the concession  known  as
    DP5/96.  That policy, and those which followed, created a general,  but
    rebuttable,  presumption that enforcement action would  "not  normally"
    proceed in cases where a child was born here and had lived continuously
    to the age of 7 or over, or where, having come to the United Kingdom at
    an early age,  7  years  or  more  of  continuous  residence  had  been
    accumulated[2]. Although there have been shifts and amendments to  this
    policy over the years, the government has consistently maintained  that
    a residence of at least 7 years' duration is a  significant  benchmark.
    As the  policy  statement[3]  which  accompanied  the  introduction  of
    paragraph 276ADE (1)(iv) put it:

         "a period of 7 continuous years spent in the UK  as  a  child  will
         generally establish a sufficient level of  integration  for  family
         and private life to exist such that removal would normally  not  be
         in the best interests of the child"


    [my emphasis]


    The Hansard record  of  the  debate  in  the  House  of  Lords  on  the
    introduction of section 117B(6) (in the Immigration Act 2014) sets  out
    the government's position on the significance of the seven  year  mark,
    as explained by then Home Office Minister Lord Wallace of Tankerness:


         "we have acknowledged that if a child has reached the age of seven,
         he or she will have moved beyond simply having his or her needs met
         by the parents. The child will be part of the education system  and
         may be  developing  social  networks  and  connections  beyond  the
         parents and home. However, a child who has not spent seven years in
         the United Kingdom either will be  relatively  young  and  able  to
         adapt, or if they are older, will be likely  to  have  spent  their
         earlier years in their country of origin or another  country.  When
         considering  the  best  interests  of  the  child,  the   fact   of
         citizenship is important but so is the  fact  that  the  child  has
         spent  a  large  part  of  his  or  her  childhood  in  the  United
         Kingdom"[4].

17. The Respondent's current policy statement reaffirms that  this  is  the
    starting  point  for  consideration  of  the  rule.    The  Immigration
    Directorate Instruction 'Family Migration:  Appendix  FM  Section  1.0b
    Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year  Routes'
    ("the IDI") reads:
         11.2.4. Would it be unreasonable to expect a non-British Citizen
         child to leave the UK?
         The requirement that a non-British Citizen child has lived in the
         UK for a continuous period of at least the 7 years immediately
         preceding the date of application, recognises that over time
         children start to put down roots and integrate into life in the UK,
         to the extent that being required to leave the UK may be
         unreasonable. The longer the child has resided in the UK, the more
         the balance will begin to swing in terms of it being unreasonable
         to expect the child to leave the UK, and strong reasons will be
         required in order to refuse a case with continuous UK residence of
         more than 7 years.
         The decision maker must consider whether, in the specific
         circumstances of the case, it would be reasonable to expect the
         child to live in another country.
         The decision maker must consider the facts relating to each child
         in the UK in the family individually, and also consider all the
         facts relating to the family as a whole. The decision maker should
         also engage with any specific issues explicitly raised by the
         family, by each child or on behalf of each child.
    [my emphasis]


18. All of this guidance recognises that after a  period  of  seven  years'
    residence a child will have forged strong links  with  the  UK  to  the
    extent that he or she will have an established private life outside  of
    the immediate embrace of his parents and siblings. It is  that  private
    life which is the starting point of consideration under this Rule.  The
    relationships and understanding of life that a  child  develops  as  he
    grows older are matters which in themselves attract  weight.  The  fact
    that the child might be able to adapt to life elsewhere is  a  relevant
    factor but it cannot be determinative, since exclusive  focus  on  that
    question would obscure the fact that for such  a  child,  his  "private
    life" in the UK is everything he knows.   That is the  starting  point,
    and the task of the Tribunal is to then look to other factors to decide
    whether, on the particular  facts  of  this  case,  these  displace  or
    outweigh the presumption that interference with that private life  will
    normally be contrary to the child's best interests.  Those factors  are
    wide-ranging and varied. The IDI gives several examples including,  for
    instance, the child's health,  whether  his  parents  have  leave,  the
    extent of family connections to the country of proposed return.  In  MA
    (Pakistan) Elias LJ (albeit reluctantly) accepted  that  it  must  also
    encompass matter pertaining to the family as  a  whole,  including  the
    factors at s117B(1)-(5) as they relate to the parents.  The  assessment
    of what is "reasonable" will call for the  Tribunal  to  weigh  all  of
    these matters into the balance  and  to  see  whether  they  constitute
    "strong reasons" - the language of the current IDI -  to  proceed  with
    removal notwithstanding the established Article 8 rights of  the  child
    in the UK.


19. None of that featured in the reasoning in the present case.  These were
    children who had always had lawful leave, as had their  parents.  There
    was no criminality, nor any other obvious  countervailing  factors.  No
    weight appears to have been given to  the  uncontested  fact  that  the
    children had established private lives in this country.

20. I am accordingly satisfied that the reasoning in respect of  the  three
    young Appellants is incomplete, flawed and must be set aside.



    Article 8 ECHR

21. At paragraph 41 the First-tier Tribunal directed itself that "in  light
    of current  jurisprudence,  after  applying  the  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules, only if there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain....is it necessary for Article 8  purposes  to
    go on to  consider  whether  there  are  exceptional  or  compassionate
    circumstances". It went on, at paragraph  42,  to  find  that  no  such
    exceptional or compassionate circumstances  existed,  and  the  appeals
    were dismissed on this ground.


22. Before  me  Mr  Norton  accepted  that  this  would  appear  to  be  an
    application of what became known as the Gulshan gateway  test,  derived
    from Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640
    (IAC) and disapproved by the Court of Appeal  in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 985 [Aikins LJ at 128]. There is no need for any  intermediary
    test,  nor  are   the   Appellant's   required   to   demonstrate   any
    exceptionality. The test is whether it would be proportionate to remove
    them.  He further accepted that the findings on Article 8 would need to
    remade if I set the decision in respect of 276ADE(1)(iv) aside.

23. It follows that the findings on Article 8 are set aside to be remade.



    The Re-Made Decision


    276ADE(1)(iv)

24. I start with the Rules. Since neither adult Appellant  can  qualify,  I
    deal only with the children, Appellants 3-5.


25. The relevant  rule  is  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv),  and  the  applicable
    guidance is that set out above, as well  as  in  the  decisions  of  MA
    (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and PD and Others (Article 8 - conjoined
    family claims) [2016]  UKUT 108.

26. At the date that I remake the decision in these  appeals  the  children
    have all lived here for ten years. I accept that the first limb of sub-
    paragraph (iv) is therefore met.

27. The Respondent's guidance states that it would normally be contrary  to
    the children's best interests to  remove  them  after  that  length  of
    residence. That is my starting point. I accept that these children have
    established strong private lives and have put down roots outside of the
    home.  I have been given letters from their Head of  House  from  their
    current  school  who  describes  all  three  pupils  "thriving",  being
    children who have evolved into  "global  citizens",   involved  in  the
    local community and raising money for  various  charities.  Both  girls
    have made excellent academic progress  and  are  considered  likely  to
    attend a Russell Group university. Their brother MQ is  also  commended
    for his representation of the school on the sports field.   In addition
    to their life at school the children have become accustomed to  British
    culture and have developed close friendships. I accept that  all  three
    children have established a very strong private life in the UK  and  in
    accordance with the published guidance  that  is  a  matter  that  must
    attract substantial weight to.

28. I bear in mind that young people are adaptable and that they  could  go
    back to Pakistan.  They  can  all  speak  Urdu  and  have  demonstrated
    learning capacity to improve it if  necessary.  They  could  resume  or
    build relationships with other family members  and  new  friends.  They
    could attend school.   I have placed some weight on those factors.

29. The fact that return to Pakistan is possible does not however  make  it
    reasonable. I remind myself of the guidance in MA  (Pakistan)  and  the
    published policy of the Respondent. There are no factors in these cases
    which would lead me to depart from the  presumption  inherent  in  that
    guidance. I am satisfied that it would be contrary to these  children's
    best interests to disrupt their education,  friendships  and  home.   I
    must now look to whether there are any countervailing factors such that
    those best interests would be outweighed.

30. This is a family unit who have made no claim on public funds.  Although
    at the date of application IAQ was  not  earning  a  sufficiently  high
    income to satisfy the rules, it was expressly conceded before the First-
    tier Tribunal that today he is. The children - and their sponsor father
    - all speak fluent English.  They have all had  lawful  leave  for  the
    entire time that they have lived in the United  Kingdom.  There  is  no
    criminality involved.     Their  private  lives  have  of  course  been
    established at a time when their status was precarious, but I  bear  in
    mind that the rule exists to regularise the position of  children  with
    long residence, and that as children they  can  hardly  be  blamed  for
    continuing to grow up whilst their immigration  status  was  less  than
    settled.

31. I have considered the fact that it would be possible for these children
    to return to Pakistan but I am not satisfied this amounts to a  "strong
    reason" - the language of the Respondent's policy - why they should  do
    so today. They have established private lives in the UK, recognised  by
    policy and caselaw as matters attracting considerable weight, and on  a
    balance of probabilities I find that it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect them to leave the UK.

32. The Third, Fourth and Fifth Appellants all  succeed  in  their  appeals
    under the Rules.





    MI: Article 8 ECHR

33. MI has an established private and family life in  the  United  Kingdom.
    She has lived in this country since 2006. I accept if she  were  to  be
    removed from the UK there would be an interference with that life.


34. The decision to remove is a lawful  one:  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    entitled to remove persons who no longer qualify for leave to remain.

35. In assessing whether or not it would be  proportionate  for  MI  to  be
    removed, I must have regard to the public interest factors set  out  in
    s117B of the Nationality. Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.   In  his
    submissions Mr Khan placed emphasis on section 117B  (6)  of  the  NIAA
    2002:

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public
         interest does not require the person's removal where-


         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
         with a qualifying child, and


         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
         United Kingdom.

36. It is not in issue that  MI  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with her three minor children. For  the  reasons  set  out
    above, I am satisfied that it would not be reasonable for the  children
    to leave the UK: I have reached that decision  having  weighed  in  the
    balance all of the other public interest factors at (1)-(5).  It cannot
    therefore be said to be in public interest that MI is  removed.      It
    follows that her appeal must be allowed on Article 8 grounds.




    HAQ: Article 8 ECHR


37. The position of HAQ is not so straightforward. He is now  an  adult  so
    cannot benefit, like his younger siblings, from  policies  relating  to
    children. He is not a parent so cannot benefit, like his  mother,  from
    the terms of s117B(6).


38. I heard oral evidence  directly  from  HAQ,  who  adopted  his  witness
    statement dated 30th September 2015.  He explained that he was  fifteen
    years old when he was brought to the UK as  a  dependent  of  his  work
    permit father. He had lived, until that point, with his grandparents in
    Karachi.  He has not been back to Pakistan since.   He attended school,
    and following his  GCSEs  progressed  to  Redbridge  College.    He  is
    working part-time at Marks and Spencer's for pocket money but hopes  to
    go to university. He wants to work in investment banking.   In response
    to Mr Norton's questions HAQ said that he could not simply transfer his
    qualifications to Pakistan he would have to do other exams there if  he
    wanted to go to university. His father could not afford the fees.  Here
    it is easier because he would be able to get a student loan.  HAQ  told
    me that he has a lot of friends in the UK. He has a girlfriend  who  he
    has been with for over three years. She  is  mixed  race,  of  Moroccan
    origin. He has a good friend called Paul who he goes to the  pub  with.
    He has got used to life here and enjoys his social life a lot. He  does
    not think that he would "fit in" in Pakistan. He continues to  live  as
    part of  the  family  unit  with  his  parents  and  siblings,  and  is
    financially maintained by his father.

39. When HAQ told me that he was "used to life here" I did not doubt it for
    a moment.   The objective observer could be forgiven from assuming that
    this  personable young man had lived here all  his  life.  His  accent,
    demeanour and outlook  were  that  of  a  young  Londoner.  I  have  no
    difficulty in accepting that he has an established private life in this
    country.  HAQ is now aged 21. He remains at home with his  parents  and
    younger brother and sisters. Apart from the "going out money"  that  he
    earns in his part time  job,  he  is  financially  dependent  upon  his
    father, and remains in full time  education.   Mindful  that  in  these
    scenarios there is no bright line between minority and  majority  I  am
    prepared to accept that HAQ continues to have a family life here.

40. His removal would result in an interference with his enjoyment of those
    Article 8 rights.

41. Although not an exhaustive list, my assessment  of  proportionality  is
    framed by the factors set out in s117B of the 2002 Act.

42. HAQ has always had lawful leave to enter or  remain  in  this  country.
    Neither he, nor any member of the family, has ever breached a condition
    of leave.  He has however no present claim for leave  to  remain  under
    the rules. In the case of  his  siblings  and  mother,  the  rules  and
    statute specifically provide for further leave to be granted. There  is
    no such provision for a 21 year old who has only lived in this  country
    for six years.

43. He speaks fluent English, and that is plainly something that has helped
    him to integrate into life in the UK.

44. HAQ is supported by his father. Although there is  no  suggestion  that
    any member of this family have ever had any recourse to public funds  I
    must weigh against HAQ the fact that he is not financially independent:
    Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    803.

45. HAQ has never had settled status in the UK so I am bound, by  terms  of
    statute to attach little  weight  to  the  private  life  that  he  has
    established whilst his status was 'precarious'.

46. HAQ has no children so s117B(6) has no  application.  So  too  s117B(4)
    since he has never been here unlawfully.

47. Aside from these factors the thrust of the case is  that  HAQ  spent  a
    proportion of his childhood here, remains part of the family  unit  and
    has in the time that he has spent in this  country  become  integrated.
    Mr Khan stresses that all of the time that HAQ has lived  here  he  has
    had leave to do so.  He is ambitious and would like to get a job in the
    City and contribute to the economy. As his links to this  country  have
    become deeper, his ties to Pakistan  have  accordingly  diminished.  He
    does not want to go back to live with his grandparents  in  Karachi  or
    adapt to the  education  system  in  Pakistan.  His  social  life  will
    undoubtedly be impaired; he will not for instance be able to  "go  down
    the pub with Paul" or see his girlfriend.     I  have  placed  as  much
    weight as I am able on those matters.

48. Having considered all of these factors in the  round  I  am  unable  to
    conclude that it would  be  disproportionate  for  HAQ  to  be  refused
    further leave or removed from the UK today.   Life in Karachi  will  be
    different, but it cannot be said that it would be unjustifiably  harsh,
    nor even unreasonable. HAQ has a home to go to.  He  has  close  family
    members including two sisters who live there. Although he is  obviously
    used to life in the UK I do not accept  that  he  has  become  entirely
    alienated from Pakistani culture or language. Karachi is not a  village
    where it might be said that life would be very restrictive for a  young
    man.   HAQ placed some emphasis on the financial cost to his father  of
    him studying in Pakistan. I am unable to find that his removal would be
    disproportionate because his father cannot, or does not  want  to,  pay
    his tuition fees.   I am bound by  the  terms  of  s117B(5)  to  attach
    "little weight" to the private life that HAQ has developed since he has
    been here. In those circumstances the significant weight that  must  be
    attached to the public interest (in removing persons  with  no  further
    right to remain under the rules) must prevail.   It is  of  course  the
    case that HAQ could apply to enter or remain in the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant if he wished to  continue  with  his  studies
    here. That his father would have to find the money for  his  fees  does
    not make that option disproportionate.




    Decisions

49. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law
    such that the decision must be set aside.


50. The re-made decisions in the appeal are as follows:

    "The appeals of the First,  Third,  Fourth  and  Fifth  Appellants  are
    allowed on human rights grounds.


    The appeal of the Second Appellant (HAQ) is dismissed."


51. There is a direction for anonymity.
