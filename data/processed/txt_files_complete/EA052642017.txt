Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Som Nwakwu instructed by Moorehouse Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Nigel Bramble, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the respondent's refusal to
    grant her  an  EEA  residence  document  pursuant  to  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 as the  spouse  of  a  person
    exercising Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

 2. It is common ground that the evidence which was before the Secretary of
    State was inadequate to show that the sponsor was  in  fact  exercising
    Treaty rights as asserted.

 3. On 29 September 2017 the First-tier Tribunal sent  to  the  appellant's
    former  representatives,  Jesuis  Solicitors  the  Tribunal's  standard
    directions, which she passed to her current representatives, Moorehouse
    Solicitors:

         "The respondent must send  copies  of  all  the  documents  to  the
         Tribunal to the other party.  This should include  a  copy  of  the
         notice of decision to which the notice of appeal  relates  and  any
         other document provided to the appellant giving  reasons  for  that
         decision together with any Statement of Evidence Application  Form,
         record of interview or any other unpublished documents on which you
         rely to arrive before 27 October 2017.

         The appellant must send copies of all documents to the Tribunal and
         to the other party a bundle of all documents you wish to rely on in
         support of the appeal.  You should identify any essential  passages
         you consider highly significant in your appeal, copies of documents
         in a language other than English must  be  accompanied  by  a  full
         certified English translation.

         It is important to submit all the documents as  soon  as  they  are
         available as the respondent will review  the  evidence  you  submit
         before the hearing of your appeal.   This  could  result  in  their
         decision being revised in your favour.  If this happens your appeal
         may be treated as withdrawn and the hearing cancelled.

         The appellant  must  send  copies  of  all  the  documents  to  the
         respondent at the Presenting Officers' Unit.  The  respondent  must
         send copies of all the documents to the appellant."

    The appellant's former representatives, Jesuis Solicitors, did  nothing
    in response to that notice.

 4. Notice of hearing was issued on 30 November 2017, for a hearing  on  21
    May 2018, some 8 months ahead.  Moorehouse Solicitors were  instructed,
    and had been acting for the appellant for just over  a  fortnight  when
    the notice of hearing was issued: there is a notice of  acting  on  the
    file dated 14 November 2017.  The directions with the 30 November  2017
    notice of hearing were as follows:

         "You must send the following documents to the Tribunal at the above
         address and to the other party to arrive no later  than  five  days
         before the date of full hearing.

            . Witness statements of  the  evidence  to  be  called  at  the
              hearing

            . A bundle of all documents being relied  on  at  the  hearing.
              These must be clearly page numbered, indexed  and  include  a
              schedule identifying the essential  passages  (the  essential
              passages are any sections you consider highly significant  in
              your appeal).

            . The appellant must send copies of all the  documents  to  the
              respondent at the Presenting Officers' Unit.

            . The respondent must send copies of all the documents  to  the
              appellant.

            . Copies of documents in a language other than English must  be
              accompanied by a full certified translation."

 5.   I  am  told  this  morning  that  there  the  appellant  and  sponsor
    experienced some difficulties in obtaining from Jesuis  Solicitors  the
    documents on their file, but since Mr Nwakwu, the appellant's solicitor
    with Moorehouse Solicitors, was able to show me a copy of the  standard
    directions, I am satisfied that Moorehouse Solicitors were aware of the
    need to produce documents in advance of the hearing.

Refusal letter

 6. The refusal letter of 23 May 2017 set out what the  Home  Office  would
    expect to see: evidence that the appellant was registered with HMRC and
    was paying income tax, national insurance or  VAT  as  a  self-employed
    person, proof of his earnings as a self-employed person in the form  of
    business bank accounts, copies of  invoices  issued  by  the  business,
    receipts for payments or work carried out and  statutory  accounts  and
    evidence such as contracts of services, business advertising and client
    testimonials to show the business was actively trading.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 7. Mr Nwakwu was acting in two appeals on the morning of the hearing on 21
    May 2018.  By that morning, no bundles had been filed for the appellant
    in this appeal.   Mr Nwakwu had a bundle with him, but did not hand  it
    to the clerk for this  appellant's  appeal  at  the  beginning  of  the
    hearing: instead, he completed the  other  client's  hearing  and  then
    produced to the Judge hearing this appellant's appeal a 92-page  bundle
    of documents.  The First-tier Judge  heard  submissions  on  the  late-
    produced bundle, and decided to refuse to admit it into  evidence,  for
    the reasons given at [13] in his decision:

         "I have considered the points raised by  both  representatives  and
         decided to refuse the application to admit this evidence.  No  good
         reason was put forward why the bundle has been filed  so  late.   I
         have taken into account the overriding objective and  the  parties'
         obligation to corroborate with the Tribunal as set out in paragraph
         2 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules  2014.   I  considered  that  the
         appeal could be fairly and justly dealt with  today.   This  is  an
         appeal where there are no removal directions and Article 8  is  not
         to be considered.  This is not an appeal requiring anxious scrutiny
         of the evidence and where it is  the  appellant's  last  chance  to
         remain in the UK.  To have admitted this evidence at a  late  stage
         would have prejudiced the respondent's position and it is important
         that both parties are dealt with fairly.   There  was  insufficient
         time for either myself or  Ms  Leyshon  to  properly  consider  the
         appellant's bundle as it was submitted so late.  Mr Nwakwu did  not
         make an application for an adjournment."

 8. The grounds of appeal assert that it was not  open  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to exclude the documents on the basis that no good reason  had
    been put forward for their late production.  I note that the First-tier
    Judge's typed record of proceedings records Mr Nwakwu as saying that he
    wished to proceed, to save costs, and that  an  adjournment  would  not
    assist as the issues were narrow.

 9. At the hearing this morning, Mr Nwakwu asserted that  he  did  make  an
    adjournment application, but that is not amongst the grounds of  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal and there is no application to vary the  grounds.
    I consider that if the appellant had wished to seek an adjournment, and
    been refused, the question of an adjournment would certainly have  been
    raised in the grounds of appeal.    I  do  not  accept  that  any  such
    application was made and I  refuse  to  permit  any  variation  of  the
    grounds of appeal on which permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    was granted.

10. I have seen a copy of the Home Office Presenting Officer's note of  the
    hearing, which records that the judge reflected and  rose  to  consider
    the position on admitting the bundle on the day  of  the  hearing,  and
    that the appellant and her husband had the  opportunity  to  give  oral
    evidence.  That is borne out by the typed Record of Proceedings on  the
    file, in which Mr Nwakwu is recorded as having sought to  persuade  the
    Judge that at the date of application there was at least some  evidence
    that the sponsor was  exercising  Treaty  rights  through  his  company
    structure.

Permission to appeal

11. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  PJM
    Hollingworth on the following basis:

         "The judge declined to admit into evidence a  bundle  submitted  on
         behalf of the appellant despite the facts as  referred  to  by  the
         judge. It is arguable that unfairness has arisen in relation to the
         appellant's case.  The appellant was represented.  It  is  arguable
         that the appellant was entitled to expect that the full  extent  of
         the available evidence would be placed before  the  judge.   It  is
         arguable that other steps were  available  which  could  have  been
         taken to  avoid  the  causing  of  prejudice  or  the  creation  of
         potential prejudice to the applicant."

Rule 24 Reply

12. The respondent's Rule 24 Reply, so far as material, states as follows:

         "The respondent submits that it was open to the First-tier Tribunal
         Judge to exclude the appellant's evidence  bundle  (which  had  not
         been filed in accordance with directions, the hearing date for  the
         appeal having been set some eight months before  the  hearing  took
         place).  The First-tier Judge also properly records that this  case
         was to confirm a right of  residence  and  was  not  a  removal  or
         Article 8 ECHR case  and  that  the  appellant  could  make  a  new
         properly documented application.  The fact the First-tier  Tribunal
         could take into account the appellant's circumstances at  the  date
         of the hearing did not require him to admit late evidence."

13. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Submissions

14. For the appellant, Mr Nwakwu  submitted  that  self-employment  is  not
    defined in the Regulations and  there  exists  no  definitive  list  of
    documents to be provided as proof of exercising Treaty rights on a self-
    employed basis.  No more onerous burden should be placed on an European
    Union citizen than on a national of the United Kingdom.

15. Mr Nwakwu submitted that had the respondent made his own enquiries,  he
    would have been satisfied that the sponsor was economically  active  in
    the United Kingdom and exercising his Treaty rights here.    Mr  Nwakwu
    argued that the respondent could have  verified  matters  himself:  the
    register maintained by Companies House would have  confirmed  that  the
    sponsor's limited company was still in  existence  and  HMRC  if  asked
    could have confirmed that he was exercising Treaty  rights  and  paying
    tax at the material times.

16. Mr Nwakwu observed that the Home Office Presenting  Officer  had  taken
    the 92-page bundle on the day and could by  now  have  made  a  further
    decision thereon.

17. For the respondent, Mr Bramble submitted that it remained open  to  the
    appellant to make a properly documented application.   The  grounds  of
    appeal did not assert that  there  had  been  any  application  for  an
    adjournment and the First-tier Judge had given adequate reasons for his
    decision. He agreed that it would not be necessary to remit the  appeal
    as all relevant evidence was before the Upper Tribunal.

Analysis

18. There is no challenge to the First-tier Judge's decision in the grounds
    of appeal on the basis of failure to adjourn.  I do not  consider  that
    argument, which I have not admitted.

19. The appellant relied on the decision of the Upper Tribunal  in  Boodhoo
    and Another (EEA Regs: relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT 00346 (IAC) where
    the judicial head note was as follows:

         "1.  Neither Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
             Act 2002 nor the guidance in DR  (Morocco)*  [2005]  UKAIT  38
             regarding a previous version of Section 85(5) of that Act  has
             any bearing on  an  appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European
             Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  In such an appeal a Tribunal
             has power to consider any evidence which it thinks relevant to
             the  substance  of  the  decision  including  evidence   which
             concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision.

         2.   Accordingly evidence of  comprehensive  sickness  cover  which
             began after the date of  the  decision  appealed  fell  to  be
             considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge as it was  plainly
             relevant to the substance of the decision albeit that it arose
             after the date of that decision.

         3.   It is particularly  important  that  the  Home  Office  should
             engage properly with observations of the Upper  Tribunal  made
             on or following the grant of permission to appeal."

20. The Boodhoo decision only states that the  First-tier  Tribunal  has  a
    discretion to admit evidence.  In this case there was a signal  failure
    by the appellant's representatives  even  to  attempt  to  comply  with
    directions which are intended to avoid  precisely  the  situation  that
    arose at the hearing, that is to say, both the respondent and the Judge
    being taken by surprise by a substantial volume of documents.

21. The appellant still has  not  explained  why  the  92-page  bundle  was
    produced so late, but in any event, its contents are  not  material  to
    the outcome of this appeal. The 92-page bundle is on the  appeal  file.
    Most of the material identified as required in the letter of refusal is
    not in that bundle.  There  are  two  invoices  from  2016,  one  on  9
    November and one on 26 October which between them total �788 plus  VAT.
    There are no HMRC documents save for a P60 for the tax  year  ending  5
    April 2018 which is nothing to the point  as  regards  the  application
    made to the respondent.  There are, in addition, a number of  documents
    which might now arguably  form  the  basis  of  a  properly  documented
    application, but there is nothing in this  bundle  which  had  it  been
    admitted would meet the respondent's requirements as  set  out  in  the
    letter of refusal or have materially altered the decision made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

22. There continues to be no proper explanation  from  Mr  Nwakwu  for  the
    appellant as to why he considered it appropriate to keep  the  relevant
    documents up the appellant's sleeve until the morning  of  the  hearing
    rather than submitting them in time so that the respondent can have the
    opportunity of considering whether they are likely to change his  view.



23. Nor has the appellant produced any authority for the  proposition  that
    the investigatory burden should be regarded as having  shifted  to  the
    respondent.   It was for the appellant to show that the sponsor met the
    requirements of the Rules at the date of  application.  The  respondent
    was not required to make his own enquiries at Companies House, or  with
    HMRC.

24. On the question whether  the  appellant  could  instead  make  a  fresh
    application Mr Nwakwu insisted that he was  entitled  to  rely  on  the
    present application, made  in  November  2016.   Mr  Nwakwu  asked  the
    Tribunal to say what else would be required if a fresh application were
    to be made.   The answer is contained in the refusal letter.

25. The decision made by the First-tier Judge was plainly open to him and I
    am not satisfied that there  is  any  material  error  of  law  in  his
    decision.

26. This appeal is therefore dismissed.
