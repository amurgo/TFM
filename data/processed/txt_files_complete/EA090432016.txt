                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Kareem, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW

 1. The appellant's appeal brought under Regulation 26 of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 against the decision  of  the
    respondent  date  18  July  2016  to  refuse  him  a   residence   card
    acknowledging his right of  residence  as  an  extended  family  member
    (durable relationship) of an EEA national was dismissed by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, which considered it did not have  jurisdiction  to  hear
    the appeal in line with the decision in Sala (EFMs:  Right  of  Appeal)
    [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC).

 2. It is now clear that Sala was wrongly decided: see Khan v  SSHD  &  Anr
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1755. It follows that the First-tier  Tribunal,  whilst
    it applied the law as it was then understood to  be,  made  a  material
    error of law. The decision is set aside.

 3. The representatives  were  in  agreement  that  the  appeal  should  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing before  another
    judge. Having considered the Senior President's Practice  Direction  of
    15 September 2012, I make an order under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

 4. The appeal will be reheard in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  so  that  the
    appellant can present his evidence and arguments to show whether or not
    be can bring himself within Regulation 8(5) of the EEA Regulations.  If
    the appellant succeeds in showing he comes within Regulation  8(5),  it
    will then be necessary for the respondent to consider whether to  grant
    a residence card under Regulation 17(4).

 5. No section 120 notice was served in this case. To the extent the First-
    tier Tribunal declined to hear the appellant's human rights  arguments,
    it did not err in law: see Amirteymour v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 353.  For
    the avoidance of doubt, therefore, the appellant may  not  raise  human
    rights arguments in the remitted appeal.

Notice of Decision

The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error of  law  and  his
decision dismissing the appeal is set aside. The appeal is remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal to be reheard by another judge.

No anonymity direction is made.
