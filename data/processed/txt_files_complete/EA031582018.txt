Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms M Malhotra, Counsel instructed by R W Anderson &
                    Co, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    BACKGROUND

      1. The Appellant appeals against a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
         Judge M A Khan promulgated on 28  December  2018  ("the  Decision")
         dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of  State's
         decision dated 12 September 2016 refusing the Appellant a residence
         card as the extended family member (cousin)  of  an  EEA  (Italian)
         national, Mr Mumtaz ("the EEA sponsor").

      2. The Respondent refused to issue a residence card  as  he  contended
         that the Appellant had failed to establish that he was dependent on
         the EEA sponsor or a member of his household prior to coming to the
         UK nor that he has been dependent on or living in the EEA sponsor's
         household since arriving in the UK.   The  Appellant's  immigration
         history is adequately set out at [1] and [2] of the Decision and  I
         do not repeat that.  I note  that  the  Appellant  entered  the  UK
         initially as a student and, following curtailment of his  leave  in
         that category then  sought  leave  to  remain.   According  to  the
         Respondent's decision letter, the Appellant did not mention the EEA
         sponsor as a source of funds when  seeking  entry  clearance  as  a
         student.  Nor did he mention him in  his  earlier  application  for
         leave to remain.

      3. The Judge's conclusion in relation  to  the  Appellant's  claim  is
         found at [38] of the Decision as follows:

             "On the evidence  as  noted  above  and  my  findings  of  the
             appellant and  his  cousin's  credibility,  I  find  that  the
             appellant has never been  financially  dependent  on  the  EEA
             national, he is not dependent on his  cousin  in  the  UK  and
             neither have they lived together under the same roof, prior to
             the EEA sponsor's arrival in the UK in 2015."

      4. The Appellant raises four grounds of appeal against the Decision as
         follows:

         Ground one: Failure to consider material aspects of the Appellant's
         evidence

         The Judge rejected the Appellant's account that he lived  with  the
         EEA sponsor in Pakistan between 1991 and  1995  and  "impermissibly
         failed to consider the wealth  of  documentary  evidence"  to  that
         effect.

         Ground two: Procedural Unfairness

         The Judge took a point of his  own  volition  in  relation  to  the
         adequacy of the EEA sponsor's  earnings  when  finding  that  those
         would have been inadequate to provide funds to the  Appellant.   It
         is said that this point was not raised with the EEA sponsor at  the
         hearing.

         Ground three: Perverse/irrational finding

         The finding that the Appellant's other witness had not  provided  a
         full copy of his passport  which  might  have  shown  his  journeys
         between Italy and the UK was fundamentally  flawed  because,  as  a
         British citizen, his passport would not be  stamped  on  entry  and
         exit when travelling within Europe.   It  is  also  said  that  the
         failure of the Appellant's other witness to attend  should  not  be
         held against the Appellant as that witness could not be obliged  to
         attend.

         Ground four: Failure to consider residence in the same house  under
         the Regulations

         It is said that the Judge failed to  make  a  finding  whether  the
         Appellant lived with the EEA  sponsor  in  the  UK.   That  was  an
         alternative basis on which he could succeed as an  extended  family
         member.

      5. Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Osborne on 21 January  2019  in  the  following  terms  so  far  as
         relevant:

             "... [3] In an otherwise careful decision  it  is  nonetheless
             arguable that the issue of sending �16,197.55 between February
             and September 2009 was  not  raised  or  relied  upon  by  the
             respondent and therefore was not in issue between the parties;
             additionally, the Appellant  was  not  cross-examined  on  the
             issue and was denied the opportunity of dealing with it.

             [4]  This  arguably  material  error  of   law   having   been
             identified, all the issues raised are arguable."

      6. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision  contains
         a material error of law and if so to either remit the appeal to the
         First-tier Tribunal or to re-make the decision.  The Respondent has
         filed a Rule 24 Notice on 6 February 2019  seeking  to  uphold  the
         Decision.

    DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

      7. I deal with the grounds in the order pleaded,  even  though  it  is
         clear from the grant of permission that it  was  on  the  basis  of
         ground two that the arguable error was found to exist.   References
         to documents below are either to the Appellant's bundle (referenced
         as [AB/xx]) or to the Respondent's bundle (referenced as [RB/xx]).

    Ground One

      8. Ms Malhotra accepted that the only  evidence  in  relation  to  the
         Appellant and his cousin living together  in  Pakistan  was  to  be
         found at [RB/100-101].  Those  documents  consist  of  two  letters
         dating back to 5 May 1993 and 4 August 1995 issued by a  clinic  in
         Pakistan and on the face of it referring respectively  to  the  EEA
         sponsor and the Appellant residing at an address which is the  same
         in both cases.  Leaving  aside  that  the  address  appears  to  be
         written in different handwriting, that those are  copies  and  that
         they do not show the EEA sponsor and the Appellant residing at  the
         same address at the same time, those can scarcely be described as a
         "wealth of documentary evidence".  Further and more importantly, at
         best they show the Appellant and the EEA sponsor living at the same
         address in the 1990s when both  were  children.   The  EEA  sponsor
         moved to Italy to join his father there in June 1995 (see  [23]  of
         the Decision).  He would have been aged nine at that time (see  his
         statement at [AB/4]).  I note as an aside that this does not assist
         the Appellant's case that he and the EEA sponsor were  resident  at
         the same address at the same time relying  on  the  documents:  the
         clinic's letter in respect of the Appellant is dated after the  EEA
         sponsor left Pakistan.

      9. Even if the documents were accepted as showing what  the  Appellant
         says they do, that could not assist his case.  It  cannot  sensibly
         be suggested that the Appellant having lived in the same  house  as
         the EEA sponsor some fourteen years before the  Appellant  came  to
         the UK at a time when both were children is sufficient to show that
         the Appellant was a member of the EEA  sponsor's  household  before
         coming to the UK.  As Mr  Tufan  also  pointed  out,  there  is  no
         evidence to show that the EEA sponsor was an EEA  national  at  the
         time when he was living in Pakistan.  He relied on what is said  by
         the Tribunal (Mr  Justice  Blake,  President  sitting  with  Senior
         Immigration Judge Storey) in Moneke (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria  [2011]
         UKUT 00341 (IAC) at (ii) of the headnote that "[I]n either case the
         dependency or membership of the household must be on a  person  who
         is an EEA national at the material time."

     10. In those circumstances,  the  Judge  was  entitled  to  reject  the
         Appellant's evidence that he and the EEA sponsor lived together  in
         the same household between 1991 and 1995 for the reasons  given  at
         [27] and [28] of the Decision as follows:

             "[27]     ... I do not accept the appellant and  his  cousin's
             evidence that  they  lived  together  in  the  same  household
             between 1991 and 1995. There is no  mention  of  this  in  the
             appellant's written witness statement.

             [28]      The EEA sponsor in his statement  states  that  they
             grew up together in the same household but gives no  dates  as
             to when this was.  There is a  detailed  representations  made
             with the appellant's application, however, there is no mention
             of the appellant and  his  EEA  sponsor  living  in  the  same
             household in Pakistan.  I find that  this  evidence  has  been
             added on to show that before arriving  in  the  UK,  both  the
             appellant and his EEA national sponsor lived  under  the  same
             together [sic].  I do  not  find  this  evidence  credible  or
             consistent."

     11. Even  if  the  documentary  evidence  did  point  to  the  opposite
         conclusion (which it does not), any error would make no  difference
         because there could be no finding that the Appellant was  a  member
         of the EEA sponsor's household before coming to the UK.

    Ground Two

     12. Ms Malhotra relied on the evidence that the EEA  sponsor  had  sent
         money to the Appellant between February and  September  2009.   She
         said that this was not disputed by the Respondent  in  the  reasons
         for refusal letter nor raised by the  Presenting  Officer.   As  Mr
         Tufan pointed out, though, there was no appearance by a  Presenting
         Officer at the hearing before Judge Khan  and  the  Respondent  had
         taken issue with the evidence as showing dependency in the  absence
         of evidence that the Appellant had received the money.   The  money
         transfers are at [RB/95-97].

     13. The Judge set out the evidence on the dependency issue at  [20]  to
         [21] of the Decision in relation to the Appellant's evidence and at
         [23] to [25] of the Decision  in  relation  to  the  EEA  sponsor's
         evidence as follows:

             "[20]     In reply to my questions, the appellant  stated  the
             evidence of his EEA sponsor sending money for his  studies  is
             contained at pages 95 to 97 of his bundle.   His  EEA  sponsor
             started financially supporting him from Italy  in  2006.   The
             EEA sponsor was working at a petrol pump; he did not know  how
             much he was earning at the time.  He said that before he  came
             to the UK he was living with his  parents  in  Pakistan.   His
             leave to remain as a student  was  curtailed  because  he  had
             failed to pay his college  fees.   He  said  that  he  had  an
             agreement with the college to  pay  by  instalments  but  they
             demanded all payment in advance, which he could not pay.

             [21]      The appellant stated that Mr Iqbal, who has provided
             a written statement to the effect that on occasions he brought
             money for him given to him by the EEA sponsor  in  Italy,  was
             not in attendance because he is busy.  The EEA sponsor came to
             live in the UK in 2015.  The EEA sponsor is self-employed,  he
             buys and sells telephone call cards, he  earns  between  �1300
             and �1500 per  month.   The  EEA  sponsor  and  his  wife  are
             separated, she and his three children live in  Italy,  and  he
             does not  financially  support  his  children.   His  cousin's
             father died in 2017 and his mother is in receipt of a pension.
              He said that the EEA sponsor has been continuously supporting
             him since 2007.

             ...

             [23]      The witness [the EEA sponsor] stated that whilst  in
             Pakistan, he and his family lived with the appellant's  family
             at their family home.  He said that in June 1995, he  and  his
             family joined his father in Italy.  He has  been  continuously
             financially helping  the  appellant  since  2007  because  the
             appellant's father had retired  and  the  family  were  having
             financial difficulties.

             [24]      The witness stated  that  there  is  no  documentary
             evidence that he has been supporting  appellant  between  2009
             and 2015 because he did not keep this evidence, as he did  not
             anticipate that he would need it.   He  stated  that  he  sent
             money to the appellant from Italy through family  members  and
             sometimes friends.  He came to the UK in 2015;  he  could  not
             remember his first  address  in  West  Ealing.   He  is  self-
             employed; he buys and sells telephone call cards.

             [25]      In reply to my questions, the witness stated that he
             started working in Italy in 2006 as  a  cashier  at  a  petrol
             station; he was age 20 at he time.  He is married  with  three
             children, he  and  his  wife  are  separated;  he  visits  his
             children in Italy but does not pay any maintenance because his
             wife is in employment.  He pays rent in the sum  of  �700  per
             month.  I put it to the witness that  his  accounts  for  2018
             show that his taxable income was �12202.00, he  pays  �700  in
             rent, how could he afford to financially support  himself  and
             the appellant?  The witness stated that his earning  sometimes
             goes up and down (vague and  evasive).   He  said  he  has  no
             evidence of his employment or earnings in Italy.  He said that
             he worked as a cashier at a petrol station in Italy  and  that
             he was earning 1100 to  1500  Euros  per  month.   He  was  in
             employment in Italy before he came to the UK in 2015."

     14. On the basis  of  that  evidence,  the  Judge  made  the  following
         findings in relation to  the  Appellant's  dependency  on  the  EEA
         sponsor prior to the Appellant's arrival in the UK:

             "[29]     The appellant came to the UK as a student  in  2009.
             Both  the  appellant  and  the  EEA  sponsor  claim  that  the
             appellant's cousin paid for the studies in the UK.  The  legal
             representations  with  the  application  state  that  the  EEA
             sponsor 'arranged his visa and study expenses  in  the  UK...'
             The appellant entered the UK on a student visa and  not  as  a
             family member of  an  EEA  national.   There  is  no  official
             documentary evidence (bank remittance receipts) to  show  that
             the EEA sponsor provided funds for  the  appellant's  studies.
             What has been provided as evidence of remittance  are  various
             receipts  from  Al-Sahara  Exchange  Co.  Ltd.  Those  are  as
             follows:

                  03/02/2009 = 983.76 Euros

                  06/03/2009 = 104,64 Euros

                  10/04/2009 = 4707.65 Euros

                  05/05/2009 = 3836.36 Euros

                  03/06/2009 = 5291.00 Euros

                  07/07/2009 = 519.84 Euros

                  04/08/2009 = 339.42 Euros

                  08/09/2009 = 414.88 Euros

             In total between February and September 2009, 16,197.55  Euros
             claimed to have been sent to the appellant in Pakistan by  his
             EEA national sponsor.  The EEA sponsor's evidence is  that  he
             worked at a petrol station earning  1100  to  1500  Euros  per
             month.  I do not find it credible or consistent that  the  EEA
             sponsor would be in a position to send the  large  amounts  of
             remittance as claimed to the appellant in 2009.  I  find  that
             all the remittance documents in the  appellant's  bundle  have
             been  created  for  the  purpose   of   his   residence   card
             application."

     15. On the face of the evidence, that finding was undoubtedly  open  to
         the Judge.  In some months, the EEA sponsor was claiming  to  remit
         to the Appellant three to four times the amount he said  he  earnt.
         The point made in the grounds, however, is  that  the  finding  was
         procedurally  unfair  because  no  point  had  been  taken  by  the
         Respondent in his decision nor by the  Presenting  Officer  at  the
         hearing.  I have already pointed out that  issue  was  taken  about
         whether the evidence showed dependency but, I accept, not based  on
         whether the EEA sponsor himself had sufficient funds  to  make  the
         payments.  I have already pointed out that there was no  Presenting
         Officer at the hearing before Judge Khan.  It is no doubt for  that
         reason that the Judge himself asked certain questions  as  recorded
         at [25] of the Decision.

     16. I have no difficulty in accepting that  it  would  be  procedurally
         unfair for a Judge to make a  finding  on  a  point  not  in  issue
         between the parties with absolutely no notice of it to  the  losing
         party.  However, I cannot accept the assertion made in the  grounds
         that the Appellant was not put on notice of the issue in  light  of
         what is said in particular at [25] of the  Decision.   The  grounds
         state without more that "the Tribunal  is  reminded  of  the  FTJ's
         detailed recital of the oral evidence at �� 18-25 which contains no
         reference to this issue being raised during the hearing".  I do not
         accept that this is so.  To the contrary,  it  is  clear  from  the
         questions which  the  Judge  posed  as  recorded  at  [25]  of  the
         Decision, that he was taking issue with the EEA  sponsor's  ability
         to provide financial support to the Appellant whether in the UK  or
         whilst the EEA sponsor was in Italy and the Appellant in  Pakistan.
         There is no witness statement from Counsel who attended the hearing
         (not Ms Malhotra) nor from the Appellant or the EEA sponsor  making
         good the factual assertion contained in the grounds.   Counsel  who
         pleaded the grounds (also not Ms  Malhotra)  was  not  Counsel  who
         appeared before Judge Khan and therefore could not have known  what
         was said.

     17. For those reasons, ground two is  not  made  out.   The  Judge  was
         entitled to rely on this point adversely to the  Appellant  and  to
         find that the Appellant was not dependent on the EEA sponsor before
         the Appellant came to the UK.

    Ground Three

     18. Although my conclusions in relation to grounds one and  two,  taken
         together, are fatal to the success of the Appellant's appeal as  he
         cannot establish that he was living with or dependent  on  the  EEA
         sponsor before coming to the UK, I deal with grounds three and four
         for the sake of completeness.

     19. I accept that the Judge's rejection of the evidence  of  the  other
         witness (Mr Iqbal) on the basis that only the  first  page  of  his
         passport is provided is a flawed reason.  Mr  Iqbal  is  a  British
         citizen and I accept his passport would not be stamped on exit from
         the UK or entry to Italy.  However, Mr Iqbal did not attend to give
         evidence because it was said that he was "too busy".  The Appellant
         says in his grounds that Mr Iqbal could not be  forced  to  attend.
         That is of course wrong because, if it were necessary, the Tribunal
         could have summonsed him  to  give  evidence.   The  weight  to  be
         attributed to evidence is a  matter  for  the  Judge.   Mr  Iqbal's
         evidence is contained in the very brief statement at [AB/36].   The
         Judge was entitled not to give that  evidence  weight  due  to  the
         inability to see the evidence tested.

    Ground Four

     20. It is said that the Judge has failed to make a finding whether  the
         Appellant is a member of the EEA sponsor's household in the UK.   I
         can deal with this ground very shortly.   It  is  implicit  in  the
         Judge's conclusion at [38] of the Decision as set out at [3] above,
         that the Judge has not rejected  this  aspect  of  the  Appellant's
         case.  Notwithstanding that implicit acceptance of this part of the
         case, the Appellant cannot succeed because he has  failed  to  show
         that he was either dependent on the EEA  sponsor  or  living  as  a
         member of the EEA sponsor's household before coming to the UK.

    CONCLUSION

     21. For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the  Decision  does  not
         contain an error of law.  Accordingly, I uphold the Decision.




    DECISION

    I am satisfied that the Decision does not contain a material  error  of
    law. I uphold the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  A  Khan
    promulgated  on  28  December  2018  with  the  consequence  that   the
    Appellant's appeal stands dismissed
