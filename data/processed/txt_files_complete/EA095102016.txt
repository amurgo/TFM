                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                        ZUZANNA JADWIGA KUSTOS-BYRSKA
                                                                  Respondent


Representation
For the appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    in person


                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The Secretary of State appealed with permission against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Agnew promulgated on 7 December 2016 allowing
    the respondent's appeal against her decision made on 12  July  2016  to
    refuse to grant her a residence card as confirmation of  her  permanent
    right of residence.

 2. When the matter came before us, Mr Duffy sought permission to  withdraw
    the Secretary of State's case.  It now transpires that in any event, Ms
    Kustos-Byrska's husband who is also a Polish  citizen,  has  lived  and
    worked in the United Kingdom for more than 10 years.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the respondent was the successful party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 4. Accordingly, with my  consent,  and  pursuant  to  rule  17(5)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, this appeal is recorded
    as "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This is a Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the respondent's case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal's decision allowing Ms  Kustos-Byrska's  appeal
    shall stand.




Signed                              Date: 28 June 2017
