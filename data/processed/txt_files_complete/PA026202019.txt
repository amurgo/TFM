For the Appellant:     Mr M Aslam, instructed by Howe & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Turkey born in 1991. His appeal  against
    the refusal  of  his  protection  claim  was  dismissed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Anthony on 4 June 2019.


The Appellant's claim

2.   It is the Appellant's case  that  he  became  a  member  of  the  G�len
    movement when he attended school in Year 6 or 7,  and  he  has  been  a
    member since then. He has taken part in meetings and activities, and he
    has supported military students when he was  at  university  by  giving
    talks and holding meetings. The Appellant throughout the time he  lived
    in Turkey had been  subscribing  to  the  G�len  movement's  magazines,
    including Keko, and had a Bylock account. The Appellant  also  assisted
    with the Kimse Yok Mu charity and volunteered to  support  the  Turkish
    Olympics associated with the G�len movement.

 3. On 15 July 2016, the G�len movement was blamed as the orchestrator of a
    military  coup.  They  were  then  recognised  as  a  terrorist  group,
    Fethullahist Terrorist Organisation (FETO). The Appellant  left  Turkey
    in September 2016 on a visit visa issued on 27 August 2016 valid  until
    27 February 2017. The Appellant applied for  further  leave  to  remain
    under the European Community Association Agreement (ECAA) 2017 and  was
    granted leave from 9 March 2017 until 30 July 2018. The  Appellant  was
    granted a further period of leave under the ECAA on 15 July 2018 for  a
    further three years.

4.   In December 2018,  the  Appellant  was  informed  by  his  father  that
    military personnel had visited the Mukhtar in their  village  informing
    him that the Appellant needed  to  report  for  military  service.  The
    Appellant attended  the  Turkish  consulate  in  London  to  defer  his
    military service. He was unable to do so because he was  informed  that
    his passport had been cancelled. The Appellant stated that his name had
    been given by informers  to  the  authorities.  The  Appellant  claimed
    asylum on 15 January 2019.  The Appellant fears return  on  account  of
    his political opinion.

5.   In his witness statement the Appellant stated:-

         "10. Between 2005 and 2009, I attended Zafer  FEN  tuition  course.
             This was also affiliated to the G�len Movement.  This  was  to
             help me with my  studies  and  also  to  prepare  me  for  the
             university entrance exams.


         11.  Whilst I was at university, I began  staying  at  the  student
             houses and  was  appointed  as  an  'Abi'  which  means  Elder
             brother. I was in charge of four of these student  houses  and
             was responsible for the education and welfare of the  students
             in my care. For this role, I had to liaise with senior members
             of the G�len Movement as I had to report on  the  progress  of
             the students in my care. At times  during  the  university,  I
             used to stay in the university student dormitory  and  provide
             religious guidance to G�len Movement students.


         12.  I used to attend meetings  and  invited  others  to  join  the
             movement. In the last year of university, I began  undertaking
             my Abi duties to military students and I  continued  this  for
             another group of military students after  I  left  university.
             Being an Abi to military students is a  sensitive  matter  and
             therefore shows the trust that was placed in me as an  Abi  by
             the G�len Movement.  In  the  investigations  by  the  Turkish
             authorities after the military coup,  they  were  particularly
             interested in those in the military and who they liaised with.
             Anyone found to be in this role, is being treated as a  senior
             FETO terrorist suspect.


         13.  I subscribed to Zaman newspaper, which is affiliated with  the
             G�len Movement. I also subscribed to Sizinti magazine and  had
             the Yagmur magazine phone application. I  also  helped  'Kimse
             Yok Mu' charity which is affiliated with the G�len Movement. I
             used to volunteer to support the Turkish Olympics,  which  was
             organised by the G�len Movement.


         14.  I also used Bylock, which was phone application used by  G�len
             Movement members.  After  the  attempted  military  coup,  the
             Turkish government was  using  evidence  of  a  person  having
             Bylock as  to  show  that  they  were  members  of  the  G�len
             Movement."


The judge's findings

6.   The judge made the following relevant findings:-


         "18. I find there is conflicting  evidence  regarding  whether  the
             Appellant is wanted by the authorities in Turkey. Firstly,  it
             is unclear as to why the Turkish consulate told the  Appellant
             he was wanted in Turkey  when  his  father  was  told  by  the
             village Mukhtar that he was needed back in Turkey to undertake
             military  service.   I  find  both  those  statements  to   be
             inconsistent with each other. If the Appellant was  wanted  in
             Turkey because of his affiliation to  the  G�len  movement,  I
             find it wholly unlikely that the authorities would want him to
             undertake military service."


         19.  The Respondent refers to the fact that the Appellant was  able
             to leave Turkey to travel to the UK in September 2016  and  he
             faced no issues leaving.


         20.  I have placed significant weight on the fact the Appellant was
             able to leave Turkey unhindered shortly after the failed coup.
             At 5.3.4 of the Respondent's Country Policy  Information  Note
             (CPIN), it is stated there have  been  many  cases  of  people
             involved in G�lenism who have attempted to leave  the  country
             but have not  succeeded  because  their  passports  have  been
             seized or cancelled before they could board the plane. I  find
             the fact the Appellant was able to leave  unhindered  strongly
             suggests he is not wanted by the authorities.


         21.  I have considered the possibility that the Appellant  may  not
             have been wanted when he left Turkey but is now a  wanted  man
             in Turkey. I have considered the Appellant's account  of  what
             happened at the Turkish consulate. If indeed it is  true  that
             the Appellant's passport was cancelled, it is  unclear  to  me
             why his passport was then returned to him by the consulate.


         22.  The background material confirms that  members  of  the  G�len
             movement have had their passports cancelled.  At 5.3.1 of  the
             CPIN, the case of EK was cited as an example  of  someone  who
             was detained at a Romanian airport after Turkey  had  annulled
             his travel documents. He had been  openly  supportive  of  the
             G�len movement. The CPIN goes on to say that several  European
             media outlets have reported on Turks  having  their  passports
             seized upon visiting Turkish  diplomatic  missions.  The  CPIN
             cites  as  an  example  the  Turkish  consulate  in  Rotterdam
             confiscating passports of people it says supported  the  G�len
             movement. Those people have been told that they are listed  as
             wanted fugitives and they will be given a one-day passport  to
             travel to Turkey to appear before the courts  to  prove  their
             innocence. I  find  the  fact  the  Appellant's  passport  was
             returned to him by the consulate officials suggests  that  his
             passport had not been cancelled.


         23.  I find the Appellant's account of what happened to him at  the
             Turkish  consulate  to  be  wholly   inconsistent   with   the
             background material. If  the  Appellant's  passport  had  been
             cancelled when he attended the Turkish consulate, then  it  is
             likely that his passport would not have been returned  to  him
             and instead confiscated. I find from the  background  material
             that the Turkish consulate  would  upon  confiscation  of  his
             passport have gone on to issue the Appellant with  a  one  way
             passport to travel to Turkey  to  face  questions  before  the
             courts to prove his innocence. The  fact  that  this  did  not
             happen suggests that  the  Appellant  is  not  wanted  by  the
             authorities in Turkey.


         24.  Ms Imamovich relies on  the  report  by  the  London  Advocacy
             League which  states  that  the  Turkish  authorities  do  not
             discriminate between low level and high profile supporters  of
             the  G�len  movement.  The  report   is   from   an   advocacy
             organisation and in the circumstances, I find that  it  is  an
             organisation advocating on behalf of the G�len movement. I  do
             not find it to be an  impartial  source  of  information.  The
             information contained within the report  is  in  my  view  not
             facts but submissions and the submissions is in  my  view  not
             supported by any factual background material.


         ...


         26.  I have considered paragraph 6.1.2 of the CPIN.   I  find  that
             this is not specific to members  of  the  G�len  movement.   I
             accept that the authorities in Turkey had a wave of purges but
             that the purges  were  directed  to  anyone  who  was  on  the
             blacklist in particular those whose names  were  published  on
             the Rezmi Gazette on Facebook and Twitter.  I find there is no
             evidence that the Appellant's name has appeared on a published
             blacklist.


         27.  I accept the background material relied on  by  the  Appellant
             demonstrates that  the  authorities  in  Turkey  have  at  its
             disposal the laws and powers  to  impose  a  lengthy  term  of
             imprisonment for those who have been charged with  anti-terror
             offences. However, in this case,  I  find  from  the  evidence
             before me that there is nothing to suggest that the  Appellant
             has been charged with such offences or that he  is  wanted  by
             the authorities in connection with such offences.


         28.  I find that the Appellant has not  discharged  the  burden  of
             proving that, having regard to  background  material  and  his
             personal circumstances, he is  at  risk  of  serious  harm  on
             return to Turkey for the  reasons  I  have  given  above.   In
             reaching these conclusions, I have had regard to the  criteria
             for assessing credibility  as  set  out  in  part  11  of  the
             Immigration Rules,  particularly  paragraphs  339HA  to  339N,
             which transpose Article 4 of the Qualification  Directive.   I
             find the Appellant is not a refugee."


 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Stephen  Smith
    on 26th July 2019 for the following reasons:-

         "1.  It  is  arguable  that  the  Judge's  reasoning  at  [18]  was
             irrational and contradictory,  in  that  the  Appellant  could
             arguably  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  explain  why  the
             authorities both wanted him for military  service  in  Turkey,
             while simultaneously having an interest in him on  account  of
             his pro-G�lenist views  and  activities.  The  Judge  arguably
             based this aspect  of  her  analysis  on  her  own  subjective
             assumption of how  the  Turkish  authorities  would  act,  and
             arguably did not engage with the explanation provided  by  the
             Appellant of the authorities' interest in him (see [10] - [14]
             of his witness statement).


         2.   The other grounds have less  merit  and  primarily  amount  to
             disagreements of fact with the  Judge's  reasoning.   However,
             given it is arguable that her analysis of the primary  account
             the Appellant gave of the authorities'  interest  in  him  was
             flawed, it is arguable that the remaining credibility analysis
             she conducted was tainted. I therefore grant permission on all
             grounds."



Submissions

 8. Mr Aslam submitted that the judge's finding, at paragraph 19, that  the
    Appellant's evidence  was  inconsistent  was  a  subjective  assumption
    giving rise to an error of law.  The judge found that if the  Appellant
    was wanted as a G�lenist then he would not be required to  do  military
    service. This was a speculative  finding  on  the  part  of  the  judge
    because there was no country information to suggest that  this  was  in
    fact the case.  Further, it required the Appellant to know what was  in
    the minds  of  the  Turkish  Government.  The  judge  assumed  how  the
    Government would operate in getting  someone  to  return  suspected  of
    being involved in the G�len movement.

9.    Secondly,  the  judge  stated  at  paragraph  20  that  she   attached
    significant weight to the fact that the Appellant  was  able  to  leave
    Turkey unhindered. However,  at  the  beginning  of  paragraph  21  she
    stepped back from that position and considered  whether  the  Appellant
    was not wanted at the time he left Turkey but was now wanted after  his
    arrival in the UK. Those  two  positions  adopted  by  the  judge  were
    inconsistent.

10.  Thirdly,  the  judge  found  that  the  Appellant's  passport  was  not
    cancelled because the Turkish consulate did not confiscate  it.  Whilst
    there was some evidence before the judge of what had happened in  other
    consulates in other countries, there was no evidence  as  to  what  the
    procedure was in the Turkish consulate in the UK. The Appellant had not
    given evidence that he handed over his passport and it was returned and
    there was no evidence to suggest how the Turkish consulate  in  the  UK
    operated in this case. The CPIN did not say that it was common practice
    for cancelled passports to be confiscated. The judge found that if  the
    Appellant had been at risk on  return  his  passport  would  have  been
    confiscated. This finding was not open to the  judge  on  the  evidence
    before her because it was not possible to  infer  that  in  every  case
    where the passport was cancelled it would have been  confiscated.  This
    finding was determinative in the conclusion that  the  Appellant  would
    not be at risk on return.

11.  The judge further failed to consider the  Respondent's  case  accepting
    the Appellant's activities with the G�len movement and his  association
    but rejecting his claim to be at risk on return due  to  his  low-level
    activities. The judge's  subjective  view  was  not  supported  by  the
    background material. The Appellant  had  been  in  charge  of  military
    students which put him at risk. The Government was interested in  those
    who were perceived to be G�lenists. The Appellant's position  with  the
    G�len movement was senior and he would therefore be a likely  terrorist
    suspect. The judge focused on the manner in which the authorities would
    or would not behave without having evidence on that  point.  The  judge
    failed to address the Respondent's case or consider the Appellant's own
    evidence and failed to  make  a  finding  on  whether  the  Appellant's
    activities were high or low-level.

12.  In summary, Mr Aslam submitted that there were three  reasons  why  the
    judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal: firstly, that he would not have
    been requested to undertake military service if  he  was  wanted  as  a
    terrorist; secondly, the Appellant would not have been  able  to  leave
    the country if he was wanted; thirdly, the Appellant's passport was not
    cancelled because it  was  not  confiscated.   All  three  errors  were
    erroneous findings and determinative of the appeal. The judge  had  not
    considered other matters as a result of  her  misplaced  focus  on  the
    three matters above.  The judge had not engaged with  the  Respondent's
    central position that the Appellant was a low-level activist which  was
    in fact contradicted by the Appellant's witness statement.

13.  Ms Cunha submitted that the judge's findings  were  not  contradictory.
    The position set out in paragraphs 20 and 21 were alternative positions
    and depended on how the case was put. The judge considered whether  the
    Appellant was at risk as a  result  of  his  G�lenist  activities.  The
    Appellant's claim that he was part of the movement and part of the army
    was considered by the judge in the light of the CPIN which set out  how
    those perceived to be G�lenists were treated. On  the  Appellant's  own
    evidence, he was not at risk as a terrorist after the coup. At the time
    of the coup the Government arrested  everyone  who  was  likely  to  be
    involved, therefore the Appellant's activities in Turkey  had  not  put
    him at adverse interest to the authorities.   The  Appellant  had  been
    able to defer his military service in Turkey and was  not  at  risk  of
    harm when he left.

14.  The Appellant's evidence that he was able  to  leave  Turkey  supported
    the Respondent's conclusion that he was not a  high-level  activist  in
    the G�len movement. The Appellant's  case  was  that  as  a  result  of
    further information obtained by the Government after the coup, even the
    low-level activities of the Appellant meant that he was now at risk.

15.  Ms Cunha submitted that if the  authorities  wanted  the  Appellant  to
    return to Turkey there was no need to cancel his passport. Even if they
    did cancel his passport, because he did not perform  military  service,
    there was no reasonable explanation for why it was returned to him.

16.  The judge's findings were open to her on the CPIN information  and  the
    judge took into account  what  had  happened  in  the  UK,  adopting  a
    balanced approach. The judge found that, notwithstanding purges by  the
    Turkish Government, the Appellant had still not demonstrated  that  his
    profile with the G�len movement would put him at risk.

17.  The Appellant's case was that his father contacted him  about  military
    service, not that he was charged with an offence.  The judge took  into
    account the Appellant's evidence.  The Appellant had not  said  he  was
    wanted or that the  authorities  were  looking  for  him.  The  judge's
    conclusion the Appellant was not at risk as a result of his  activities
    in the UK and was not at risk prior to coming to the UK  were  findings
    which were open to the judge on the evidence before her. The  Appellant
    had not demonstrated he was at risk  on  return  as  a  result  of  his
    activities with the G�len movement. The judge did not  have  to  ignore
    common sense. If the Appellant was of adverse interest  or  wanted  for
    his failure to complete military service, it would not  make  sense  to
    cancel his passport.

18.  Mr Aslam relied on paragraph 5 of the grounds and  submitted  that  the
    Appellant was told he had been  called  for  military  service  by  his
    father in Turkey. He could not pinpoint a date when he was  wanted  and
    it was at the point when the Appellant went to the consulate to request
    his call-up to be deferred that he found out that he was wanted. It was
    not known at this stage  when  his  father  was  asked  about  military
    service. The judge failed to make a finding on  whether  the  Appellant
    was considered to be a high-level activist.

19.  The judge found that the Appellant was not wanted  by  the  authorities
    when he left because he had no  problem  leaving  Turkey,  whereas  the
    Appellant's evidence was that his activities were  not  known  at  that
    stage. As of December 2018, when  the  Appellant  visited  the  Turkish
    consulate in the UK,  it was confirmed to  him  verbally  that  he  was
    wanted by the Government not because of his  failure  to  complete  his
    military  service,  but  because  of  his  activities  with  the  G�len
    movement. Whether the Appellant's passport was confiscated after it was
    cancelled was not relevant. It did not follow that,  because  that  was
    the procedure adopted in Rotterdam, the same procedure would be adopted
    in the UK. At best this point should be a neutral one because the  CPIN
    gave an example of a couple of incidents in  Rotterdam  rather  than  a
    consistent practice throughout the Turkish consulates. It was dangerous
    to infer that if the Appellant was at risk his passport would have been
    cancelled and confiscated.


Conclusion and Reasons

20.  It is the Appellant's case that  he  was  involved  with  the  G�lenist
    movement whilst in Turkey in assisting military  students  as  well  as
    being a subscriber to G�len magazines and applications. The Appellant's
    case is that he was of no interest to the authorities  before  he  left
    Turkey and was able to come to the UK on a visit visa  he  obtained  in
    August 2016 shortly after the military coup in July 2016. The Appellant
    was not wanted by the authorities prior to leaving  Turkey  or  in  the
    first two years after his arrival in the UK. The background information
    in the CPIN demonstrated that the authorities in Turkey had a  wave  of
    purges directed at anyone who was on a blacklist.

21.  It is the Appellant's case that he was not wanted  by  the  authorities
    until December 2018 when he went to the Turkish consulate in  order  to
    defer his military service. It was at that stage that he  was  informed
    he was wanted as a result  of  his  G�len  activities.   There  was  no
    evidence from the Turkish consulate to confirm the Appellant's evidence
    and the Appellant's evidence was contrary to the procedure  adopted  at
    other Turkish consulates, in particular the one in Rotterdam.

22.  The Appellant's case, at its highest, is that  he  has  been  named  by
    others who have been interrogated by the Government and he is wanted by
    the authorities for his involvement with the G�len movement because  he
    is perceived as a terrorist threat as a result of  the  military  coup.
    The Appellant made his  claim  because  he  was  told  by  the  Turkish
    consulate that his passport had been cancelled. However, the  behaviour
    of the Turkish consulate in respect of other perceived G�len  activists
    was to cancel their passports and issue them  with  a  one  day  travel
    document, and in some cases confiscate the cancelled passport.

23.  The Appellant has made an unsupported assertion that he  is  wanted  by
    the authorities because of his visit to the  Turkish  consulate.  There
    was no evidence from the Turkish consulate to show  that  his  passport
    had in fact been cancelled or to support his claim to be wanted by  the
    authorities as a perceived terrorist.

24.  The judge found that the Appellant's assertion  was  not  credible  for
    several reasons, for which she has been criticised  by  Mr  Aslam.  The
    judge's finding at paragraph 18 that the request to undertake  military
    service was inconsistent with being wanted as a  terrorist  was  not  a
    subjective assumption material to the overall decision.  Her  inference
    that it would be unlikely for the Turkish authorities to request him to
    complete his military service if he was a  suspected  terrorist  was  a
    reasonable inference to make.

25.  I am not persuaded by Mr Aslam's submission that  the  judge  has  made
    contradictory findings at paragraph  20.   The  judge  found  that  the
    Appellant was of no interest before  he  left  Turkey  because  of  his
    association with the G�len movement and then went on  to  consider  the
    position of whether he was in fact wanted as a result  of  his  support
    for the G�len movement whilst in the UK. The Appellant's own  claim  is
    that he was of no interest to the authorities until December 2018  when
    he went to the Turkish consulate.

26.   The  judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the   Appellant's
    unsupported account of what happened at the Turkish  consulate  on  the
    basis that it was inconsistent with  the  background  material  of  the
    behaviour of the Turkish consulate in other countries and the treatment
    of perceived G�lenist supporters in Turkey. This finding  was  open  to
    the judge on the evidence before her.

27.   The  judge's  reasons  for  rejecting  the  Appellant's   claim   were
    adequately explained.  The Appellant's case, taken at its  highest,  is
    that he has been a supporter of the G�lenist movement whilst in Turkey,
    but that his activities did not bring  him  to  the  attention  of  the
    authorities, and he was able to come to the UK on a visa issued by  the
    Government.  He has been requested to complete  military  service.  The
    Appellant has at no stage claimed that his family have been visited  by
    the authorities or that he was wanted in his local area.

28.  The basis of his claim to be wanted by  the  authorities  arises  as  a
    result of his visit to the Turkish  consulate  in  December  2018.  The
    judge rejected the Appellant's account of that  visit  because  it  was
    unsupported by evidence which the Appellant ought to have been able  to
    produce  if  his  account  was  true,  and  it  was  inconsistent  with
    background evidence as to what happened in Turkish consulates in  other
    countries.

29.  I am not persuaded by Mr Aslam's submission  that  the  judge  was  not
    able to rely on  the  way  the  Turkish  Government  behaved  in  other
    countries in assessing the Appellant's credibility. The onus is on  the
    Appellant to produce evidence to support his case.  He  has  failed  to
    produce evidence to show that the procedure in the UK was  in  any  way
    different and it is reasonable for the judge to infer that the  Turkish
    Government would act consistently in relation to perceived  terrorists,
    namely that their passports were cancelled and/or confiscated and those
    out of country were issued with one-way travel documents.   It  is  not
    the Appellant's case that this has happened to him.

30.  Accordingly, the judge's conclusion that the Appellant  has  failed  to
    show that he was of interest to the authorities or at risk on return as
    a result of his activities with the G�len movement was a finding  which
    was open to her on the evidence before her.  I find that there  was  no
    error of law in the decision promulgated on 4 June 2019 and  I  dismiss
    the Appellant's appeal.
