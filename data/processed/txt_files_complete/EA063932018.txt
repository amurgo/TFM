                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 10th  June  1988.  She
       arrived in the UK on 18th April 2012 as a  Tier  4  general  student
       migrant. In 2015 she applied for a derivative residence card as  the
       primary carer for her EEA child,  CFN,  who  is  a  citizen  of  the
       Netherlands.  The  application  was  refused,  and  her  appeal  was
       dismissed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Parker. She  reapplied
       to the respondent on the same basis in June 2018 and the application
       was once again refused in a decision dated 11th September 2018.  Her
       appeal against the decision to was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Malone in a determination promulgated on the 13th June 2019.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Ford on 14th August 2019 on the basis that firstly it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier judge had erred in law by unfairly finding  that
       a letter put in evidence by the appellant  had  been  tampered  with
       when that allegation was not raised by the respondent or put to  the
       appellant. This was material because that  letter  was  relied  upon
       also to find that documents regarding family land  in  Nigeria  were
       not genuine, and so  to  find  that  the  appellant  was  not  self-
       sufficient.  Secondly it was arguable that there was  a  failure  to
       consider the fact the appellant had �12,000 of savings.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    4. The appellant argues in her grounds of appeal that at  paragraph  16
       of the decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal  finds  that  the  letter
       regarding CFN has been tampered with because the name has been typed
       in a different font to the rest  of  the  letter.  This  was  not  a
       contention made by the respondent, and the appellant was  not  given
       an opportunity to deal with this issue, and so the hearing  was  not
       fair and just on this point. At paragraph 26 there is a finding that
       the appellant has �12,000 of savings in her bank account, and  there
       is a failure to go on to consider this with  respect  to  her  self-
       sufficiency. It is possible also that at paragraph 33 the First-tier
       Tribunal did not apply the correct standard of proof, and that there
       was a misconstruction of Regulation 16(2) of the EEA Regulations.

    5. Ms Fletcher accepted that the appellant would have lost  her  appeal
       before the First-tier Tribunal as there was not the relevant medical
       insurance for her other children (although this  failing  has  since
       been addressed and the relevant medical insurance  now  exists)  but
       says that this is a case where  the  appellant  was  denied  a  fair
       hearing as the contention at paragraphs 16, 22 and 31 was  that  she
       had put forward a false document, as there are  consistent  findings
       in all of those paragraphs that the letter at page 66 of the  bundle
       has been tampered with to mislead the First-tier  Tribunal  and  was
       not genuine. These findings were not based on  allegations  made  by
       the respondent and this was not a matter raised by the Judge at  the
       hearing. As such the appellant had not had the opportunity to defend
       herself  with  respect  to  this  highly  damaging   contention   of
       deception. It is important that the appellant is not seen as someone
       who has tried to pervert justice by  presenting  false  evidence  as
       that would clearly prejudice her in the future, and she is  entitled
       to the opportunity to clear her name.

    6. The appellant also makes an application to adduce new evidence  that
       the letter  from  the  Greenwich  Community  Health  Services  dated
       January 2013 is genuine and authentic,  as  this  evidence  was  not
       obtained before as the issue was not raised by the respondent and it
       is important. Ms Fletcher says that this matter is in-hand with  the
       solicitors.

    7. Mr Walker agreed that the Home Office Presenting Officer before  the
       First-tier Tribunal had not put  forward  any  contention  that  the
       letter had been tampered with and so was false evidence. He accepted
       that the hearing had been unfair due to the way this matter had been
       dealt with.

    8. At the end of the hearing I informed the parties that I  found  that
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law and that it was appropriate
       to remit the appeal to be heard again  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       with no findings preserved.

Conclusions - Error of Law

    9. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law by conducting an unfair hearing
       as there was a finding that the  appellant  had  tampered  with  the
       letter  of  Greenwich  Community  Health   Services,   offering   an
       appointment to the parent of her child, CFN, on  2nd  October  2015,
       and thereby had attempted to  mislead  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
       paragraphs 16, 22 and 31 of the decision. This was not an allegation
       made by the respondent at any point, either in the refusal letter or
       at the hearing, and having had regard to the record  of  proceedings
       in the file it is clear that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had  not
       raised the matter at the hearing  for  the  appellant  to  give  her
       evidence in response, and for her representative to make submissions
       upon.

   10. The Joint Practice Statement of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  Upper
       Tribunal concerning the disposal of appeals in this Tribunals states
       as follows at paragraph  7.2:  "The Upper Tribunal is likely on each
       such  occasion  to  proceed  to  remake  the  decision,  instead  of
       remitting the case to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  unless  the  Upper
       Tribunal is satisfied that: (a) the effect of the error has been  to
       deprive a party before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing  or
       other opportunity for that party's case to be put to and  considered
       by the First-tier Tribunal."   Given my  finding  in  the  paragraph
       above it is therefore appropriate for the matter to be  remitted  to
       the First-tier Tribunal to be heard de novo.


          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  remade  de  novo
      with no findings preserved.
