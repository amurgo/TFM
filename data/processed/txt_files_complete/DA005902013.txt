               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Claimant: Miss E King, Counsel, instructed by J D Spicer Zeb,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer (4
December 2013)
     Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer (9 January 2014)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State (the respondent) appeals with permission against
    the determination of the First-tier Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Stanford and Miss R I Emblin sitting as  a  panel)  promulgated  on  23
    August 2013.  In that determination they allowed the claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent made on 12 March 2013 to  deport
    him as a foreign criminal pursuant to Section 32(5) of the  UK  Borders
    Act 2007.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Jamaica  born  on  6  November  1986.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 13 July 2002 as a visitor and was granted
    leave to enter for six months.  He was later granted leave to remain as
    a student, and that was extended until 30  September  2004.   He  later
    became an overstayer but in May 2011 was granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of  his  relationship
    with Sian Brown, a Jamaican national, who had first been granted  leave
    to remain in September 2001.  There are three children of  the  family;
    the claimant is the father of the two youngest. The oldest child has no
    contact with her biological father.

 3. The family have not always  lived  together  in  the  same  place.   At
    present the claimant is not living with Ms Brown owing to  restrictions
    and conditions as to residence imposed upon his release from prison and
    due to restrictions imposed by the local authority from which Ms  Brown
    rents a flat.

 4. On 22 June 2012 the  claimant  was  convicted  of  assault  occasioning
    actual bodily harm and the possession of offensive weapon for which  he
    was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.

 5. On 12 March 2013 the respondent made a deportation  order  against  the
    claimant on the basis that he was a  foreign  criminal  as  defined  by
    Section 32(1) of the 2007 Act.  He considered that, as he did not  fall
    within any of the  exceptions  set  out  in  Section  33  of  that  Act
    specifically those set out in paragraphs  398,  399  and  399A  of  the
    Immigration  Rules,  that  he  should  be  deported.   The   respondent
    considered:-

      a) that as Ms Brown's older daughter is a  British  citizen,  that  it
         would be unreasonable to expect her to leave  the  United  Kingdom,
         but that her mother would be able to care for  her  in  the  United
         Kingdom;

      b) that as the claimant's daughter, S, had been living in  the  United
         Kingdom  continuously  for  seven  years  preceding  the  date   of
         immigration decision, it would be unreasonable  to  expect  her  to
         leave the United Kingdom but that she too could be looked after  by
         her mother;

      c) that the claimant is in a genuine subsisting relationship  with  Ms
         Brown but that she was not British or settled in the United Kingdom
         and that there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life with
         her being continued outside the United Kingdom;

      d) that it would be open to the children and Ms Brown to  relocate  to
         Jamaica with the claimant and that if they chose not to do  so  the
         claimant could continue his  relationship  with  his  children  and
         partner through modern channels  of  communication  and  that  they
         could adapt to living apart from him;

      e) that there were no exceptional circumstances which  would  outweigh
         the public interest  in  deporting  the  claimant  given  that  his
         offences are regarded as very serious, despite  the  fact  that  he
         arrived in the United Kingdom at the age of 15 as a minor, that  it
         was likely that he would  reoffend  if  he  was  put  in  the  same
         situation as before and that he would receive assistance on  return
         to Jamaica.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal found;

      a) that the claimant did not fall within the provisions  of  paragraph
         399(a), paragraph 399(b) or 399A of the immigration rules  [49]  to
         [51];

      b) that the claimant has committed to his role as  a  father  and  has
         supported his partner in bringing them up [41]; that he  has  roots
         in the community [43]; that the core of his family are all  in  the
         United Kingdom [44] and that there is  no  subsisting  relationship
         between the claimant and his father in Jamaica [45];

      c) that deporting the claimant  would  interfere  with  his  right  to
         respect for his family life [61] and it would be difficult  for  Ms
         Brown and the children to move to Jamaica; that the eldest daughter
         is now a British citizen and the  right  of  that  child  exercises
         citizenship is a factor [67] and that it is in the  best  interests
         of the children to be brought up by both parents  to  continue  the
         stability  they  currently  experience  within  their  nuclear  and
         extended family [68];

      d) that the interests of the children are not the only factors  to  be
         weighed in determining proportionality, noting that the  obligation
         of the respondent to deport the claimant is established by statute,
         the offence committed being regarded as extremely serious [69];

      e) that the claimant is at low risk of reoffending  and  that  he  had
         expressed remorse for what he had done [71] and whilst noting  that
         the obligation  on  the  respondent  to  deport  the  claimant  was
         established by statute [69] deportation would be a disproportionate
         interference with the right to family life of the claimant and  his
         family [73], they therefore allowed  the  appeal  on  human  rights
         grounds.

 1. The respondent sought permission to appeal against that decision on the
    grounds that;

      a) that the Tribunal's conclusion  had  been  reached  without  giving
         adequate consideration for public  interest,  thereby  misdirecting
         itself in law (see SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550), the  Tribunal
         having failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
         claimant's  circumstances   amount   to   the   extremely   unusual
         circumstances envisaged in that decision;

      b) that although referring to the public  interest  the  Tribunal  had
         failed to give adequate reasons for  finding  that  the  claimant's
         Article  8  rights  outweighed   the   public   interest   in   the
         circumstances, deportation of foreign  criminals  also  having  the
         deterrent effect and preserving public confidence in the system  of
         control;

      c) that the panel had failed to identify any exceptional circumstances
         rendering  the  claimant's  deportation   disproportionate   having
         misdirected themselves as to the meaning of exceptional, relying on
         HH v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa [2012] UKSC.

 2. On 7 November 2013 Upper Tribunal Judge  Kekic  granted  permission  to
    appeal on all grounds.

Hearing on 4 December 2013

 3. Mr Jarvis submitted that the Tribunal  had  failed  to  show  in  their
    determination what weight they had attached to the public  interest  in
    deporting the  claimant,  failing  in  particular  to  take  note  that
    automatic deport provisions attach special weight.  He  submitted  also
    that the Tribunal's approach to proportionality was flawed as  although
    they do make reference to deterrence, there is no indication that  they
    had taken into account that the purpose of deportation  extends  beyond
    that.  He submitted further that the Tribunal  had  attached  too  much
    weight to the best interests of the children.

 4. In reply Miss King submitted that the latter point was  not  one  which
    could be made given that that had not formed a ground of  appeal.   She
    submitted, relying on her Rule 24  response  that  the  respondent  was
    seeking to reargue the case.  She submitted it  was  evident  from  the
    determination [46] and [58] that  the  Tribunal  were  mindful  of  the
    public interest, were aware of the  legitimate  aim  in  deporting  the
    claimant and indicated that they  were  aware  there  has  to  be  very
    substantive reasons before a deportation order should not be  proceeded
    with [59].  She submitted that if  the  words  the  importance  of  the
    deportation is given considerable weight were added, it would not alter
    the sense of the decision and it was unfair and unreasonable  to  argue
    that the Tribunal had  not  placed  sufficient  weight  on  the  public
    interest in  reaching  their  decision.   She  submitted  when  reading
    paragraph [69] of the determination it was clear that the panel had  in
    mind  that  the  children's  best  interests  were  capable  of   being
    outweighed.

 5. In reply Mr Jarvis said that there was little reference to  the  public
    interest and that it was insufficient merely to state the legal  basis.



 6. In light of the decision in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 the panel
    erred in considering Article 8 outside the code of the Rules and  that,
    having found that the claimant did not fall within  paragraphs  399  or
    399A, should have considered  whether,  within  paragraph  398  of  the
    Immigration Rules, there were exceptional circumstances such  that  the
    claimant should  not  be  deported.   That  error  is  not  necessarily
    material, a proportionality exercise under  Article  8  differing  from
    that within paragraph 398 more in form than in substance.

 7. In MF (Nigeria) the Court of Appeal held  [40] to [41]
    40. Does it follow that the new rules have  effected  no  change  other
        than to spell out the circumstances in which a  foreign  criminal's
        claim that deportation would  breach  his  article  8  rights  will
        succeed? At this point, it is necessary to focus on  the  statement
        that it will only be "in exceptional circumstances that the  public
        interest in deportation will be outweighed by  other  factors".  Ms
        Giovannetti submits that the reference to exceptional circumstances
        serves the purpose of emphasising that, in the balancing  exercise,
        great weight should be given to the public  interest  in  deporting
        foreign criminals who do not satisfy paras 398 and 399 or 399A.  It
        is only exceptionally that such foreign criminals will  succeed  in
        showing that their rights  under  article  8(1)  trump  the  public
        interest in their deportation.


    41. We accept this submission. In view of the strictures  contained  at
        para 20 of Huang, it would have been surprising if the Secretary of
        State had intended to reintroduce an exceptionality  test,  thereby
        flouting the Strasbourg jurisprudence. At first sight,  the  choice
        of the phrase "in exceptional  circumstances"  might  suggest  that
        this is what she purported to do. But the phrase has been used in a
        way which was not intended to have this effect in all cases where a
        state wishes to remove a foreign national who relies on family life
        which he established at a time when he knew it to  be  "precarious"
        (because he had no right to remain  in  the  UK).  The  cases  were
        helpfully reviewed by Sales J in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for
        the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin). The  fact  that  Nagre
        was not a case involving  deportation  of  a  foreign  criminal  is
        immaterial. The significance of the case law lies in  the  repeated
        use by the ECtHR of the phrase "exceptional circumstances".

 8. The importance of the public interest in  deporting  foreign  criminals
    was noted in Richards v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ  244  at  [19]  and  [20]
    where Laws LJ said [21]:

   21. What in my  judgment  needs  emphasis  is  that  the  strong  public
       interest in deporting foreign criminals is now not merely the policy
       of the Secretary of State but the judgment of Parliament. That gives
       it special weight, which the courts ought to recognise, as no  doubt
       the  Strasbourg  court  will.  This  approach  sits  with  the  well
       established approach to proportionality questions in European  Union
       law where Acts of the primary legislator enjoy  a  wider  margin  of
       discretion (see R v Secretary of State for Health ex parte  Eastside
       Cheese [1999] 3 CMLR 123 per Lord Bingham, especially  at  paragraph
       48)

 9. Whilst the Tribunal does [46] state that it is in the  public  interest
    to deport a foreign criminal who falls within the provisions of the Act
    and note that the obligation on the respondent to deport  the  claimant
    is  established  by  statute  [69],  it  is  not  evident  from   their
    determination what weight they attached to that factor and whilst  they
    did acknowledge that the best interests of  the  children  were  to  be
    weighed  [69],  it  does  not  follow  from  that  that  they  attached
    significant weight to the public interest in or  of  what  factors  had
    been taken into account in reaching  the  conclusion  that  the  public
    interest was outweighed given that the factors on which they appear  to
    rely, the interests of the children, his relationship with his partner,
    are matters which are provided for within paragraph 399 and 399A  along
    with  length  of  residence  and  limited  ties  to  his   country   of
    nationality.

10. I consider also that it cannot be deduced from the  determination  that
    the Tribunal directed themselves properly in law as to the significance
    to be attached to the public interest and it would have  been  open  to
    them, on the facts of this case, to have concluded, had  they  attached
    significant and serious weight to the public interest, that they  would
    have concluded that it was proportionate to deport the claimant.

11. I do not, however, accept Mr Jarvis' submission that they attached  too
    much weight to the best interests of  the  children.   That  is  not  a
    matter which was pleaded in the grounds of appeal  and  no  application
    was made to amend them.  Further, it is not a  necessary  corollary  of
    any of the grounds as pleaded.

12. For these reasons, the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    involve the making of an error of law  and  I  set  it  aside.   I  do,
    however, preserve the findings of fact which have been made, given that
    there was no challenge to these set out in the grounds of  appeal.   It
    will be necessary to remake the  proportionality  exercise  but,  given
    that four months had now elapsed  since  the  initial  hearing,  it  is
    appropriate that  the  claimant  be  allowed  to  adduce  further  oral
    evidence updating the circumstances and so I adjourned the matter until
    9 January 2014 to hear further evidence and submissions as to  how  the
    decision should be remade.


The Hearing on 9 January 2014

 7. I heard oral evidence from the claimant as well as his fianc�e,  Sharon
    Brown and his  mother,  Mrs  Althea  Degannes.   In  addition  I  heard
    submissions from both representatives.  Despite the directions made  in
    this matter on 12 December 2013, no additional material was adduced.

 8. The claimant adopted his witness statement adding that he has now  been
    given permission by the local authority to live with  his  partner  and
    their children but is waiting confirmation that his bail address can be
    changed to permit this.  He spends time with them all day.

 9. He explained that he had on a previous occasion in the First-tier given
    different names for the children's teachers as they were the  names  he
    had known before him going into  prison.   He  takes  the  children  to
    school every day.  He said that, due  to  being  nervous,  he  had  not
    recalled at the last occasion when his younger  daughter  had  had  her
    adenoids removed.  He said that his children are everything to him  and
    they spend so much time together.

10. In cross-examination the claimant said his  younger  daughter  had  her
    adenoids removed in early 2003, initially thinking it was prior to  his
    release and said that he  did  remember  and  that  it  took  place  in
    Lewisham Hospital.  He, when asked, said he had been taken into custody
    in October 2011 but was sentenced in June 2012.

11. The claimant said that his partner had taken the tenancy at 7 Pemberton
    House just after his arrest and before that had lived with his  mother.
    The children had lived with them too.  She had also previously  applied
    for her accommodation in a hostel first but when  she  was  there  they
    came over to stay with him at his mother's house to  sleep  on  several
    nights a week as he was not allowed to stay in  the  hostel  overnight.
    They had not applied for accommodation together as at the time  he  did
    not have leave to remain in the United Kingdom so the application could
    not be made.  He said the application for bail had been  to  stay  with
    his mother as he had lived at that address for ten  years  and  as  his
    name was not on the tenancy agreement at the time, he had  been  misled
    by the authorities into believing that he could not live there although
    what in reality was the case was that he simply could not be put  on  a
    tenancy agreement.  He said that moving around had when  they  were  in
    the hostel affected the children but now he goes to  visit  his  family
    during the week and they come to spend time with him at  the  weekends.
    He said that he and his partner had first lived together since 2004 and
    continued to live there  until  2010.   He  explained  that  the  other
    addresses mentioned in  the  birth  certificate  are  properties  which
    belonged to his mother, in one case, and in the other,  property  which
    belonged to Ms Brown's aunt.

12. In re-examination the claimant said that he had  been  present  at  the
    hospital for his daughter's operation, he remembered bringing soup  for
    her in the morning and it had been after he had been released.  He said
    he was not named as the father initially on her birth certificate as at
    the time  he  had  no  status  and  was  scared  that  there  would  be
    difficulties for him if he put his name on the certificate.  He decided
    to change this after he made an application for leave to remain in 2010
    and they decided to re-register the birth.

13. I then heard evidence from Sian Brown who adopted her witness statement
    adding that the claimant sees the children every day taking them to and
    from school, cooks for them and helps them with the homework.  She said
    she is still on maternity leave and will in fact  start  back  to  work
    next week.  She said she would be working four days a week  staring  at
    7.30 in the morning until 7 p.m. or 8.30 in the morning.  She said that
    the claimant would be looking after the children and if he  has  a  job
    they would have to rearrange matters.  She said that the older girl  is
    at secondary school  and that he drops her off  first  then  takes  the
    younger child to her primary school.  She said there was no one else in
    the family who would be able to do that as they all work and they would
    need to pay someone to do it.  She said that her younger  daughter  had
    had her adenoids removed in April 2013 in Lewisham Hospital just  after
    she had given birth to her baby.  She said that she, the  claimant  and
    Ms Degannes had all been there.

14. Ms Brown said that when the claimant had been taken  into  custody  the
    children would go to school and cry and would eventually confide in the
    teachers.  She said that they would talk to her about  it,  would  wait
    for him to call as they knew the time he would call and they would talk
    to their grandmother about it.  She said that the older girl had  never
    had any contact with her biological father.  She said that there  would
    be a big hole in their life and they would be back to square one and it
    would be more difficult this time as the  older  daughter  is  in  high
    school and needs a father to look up to.  She said the younger girl  is
    a Daddy's girl and there are no words to explain how difficult it would
    be for them.

15. In cross-examination Ms Brown confirmed that she  had  taken  a  year's
    maternity leave but only got paid for nine months.  She said  that  she
    was on income support until she returns  to  work  next  month  and  is
    currently in receipt of child tax  credit.   She  said  she  had  until
    November 2013 received working tax credit and that HMRC were aware that
    she was in a relationship.  She was not quite sure when she had applied
    for accommodation separate from living with the claimant and his mother
    but thought that it was the year that he had been arrested.   She  said
    that she had had a hostel place initially and then moved to her current
    address.

16. Ms Brown explained that she and the claimant had discussed putting  his
    name on the  younger  daughter's  birth  certificate  but  he  was  not
    available to attend at the appointment she had booked to  register  the
    birth.  He had no stay at the time and he had not wanted to put  on  it
    as he got scared of putting his name on things due to his status at the
    time.  She explained that the additional addresses on the form were  in
    one case her aunt's address and in the other an address of  a  property
    which belonged to the claimant's mother.   She  said  contrary  to  the
    address the impression given that they were in  fact  living  together.
    She said that she could not get family to help out with the children on
    a long-term basis.  She said she could not imagine  how  she  would  be
    able to cope as a single parent looking after three  girls.   She  said
    they have a family life, that the  children  seemed  to  understand  it
    would be more difficult to be separated now.  She said she did not want
    to depend on the state to look  after  her  and  her  family  and  that
    although she was doing so at the moment it  was  only  on  a  temporary
    basis of two months.

17. I then heard evidence from Althea Degannes, the claimant's mother,  who
    adopted her witness statement.  She said that the  children  were  very
    affected when her son had been taken into prison.   At  the  time  they
    were staying with her and it was very emotional.   She  said  that  the
    first visit they had been  on  was  very  emotional.   The  elder  girl
    started screaming when she had to go, hanging onto her.  She  said  the
    younger girl cried all the time at night and she had to look after  her
    asking her what was wrong and that it had been heartbreaking.  She also
    said she had come back from school saying that she had broken down  and
    had to confide in teachers.

18. In cross-examination Ms Degannes said that she was still working  full-
    time and had only once been back to Jamaica since she left and that was
    for the funeral of her nephew.  She explained that that nephew had been
    her brother's child and had been brought up with her initially  by  her
    mother and then by her aunt.  She said that after they had come to  the
    United Kingdom they had  sent  money  to  him  but  it  would  be  very
    expensive now to visit Jamaica, it would cost over �1,000 a time.   She
    explained that the flat at Culverley Road was owned by her husband  who
    really looked after the matter but it had been in the past let  out  to
    friends and family including the claimant.  She said that the  children
    and Ms Brown had stayed with her until Ms Brown got her  own  flat  but
    she could not recall exactly when that  was  and  when  she  had  moved
    there.

Submissions

19. It is accepted that the claimant does not fall within the  requirements
    of paragraph 399  or  399A  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Mr  Whitwell
    submitted that there were in this  case  no  exceptional  circumstances
    such that the claimant's removal was not proportionate given  the  wide
    margin of appreciation accorded to the state in such matters.   However
    he accepted that the best interests of the children may be to  be  with
    the parents, there are other matters which are to get equal weight  and
    that attention should be paid closely to the sentencing remarks and the
    fact that the claimant had been here for fifteen years although most of
    that time had been unlawful.

20. In reply Miss King submitted that exceptionality  is  not  a  test  but
    rather the outcome and that taking into account the  decisions  of  the
    Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria) and MF (Nigeria), this case  was  still
    one of those which fell to be decided in the claimant's  favour,  given
    that the public interest is not necessarily  fixed  and  that  in  this
    case, following the criteria in Maslov referred to in MF (Nigeria)  the
    appeal falls to be allowed.   She  asked  me  to  note  also  that  the
    seriousness of the offence is  the  matter  to  be  considered  as  was
    identified in SS (Nigeria)  and  that  the  facts  of  this  case  were
    considerably different from those  in  that  case  given  the  lack  of
    criminal history and the fact that the  claimant's  presence  here  was
    lawful.  She submitted also that the respondent's decision was somewhat
    confused in that they appeared to accept in one part that  it  was  not
    reasonable to expect the children to go but in others that they should.

Decision and Reasons

21. I accept  that the claimant was nervous at the hearing before the First-
    tier Tribunal and the issues regarding the operation  on  his  daughter
    have, to a great extent, have been resolved, as have the issue over the
    difference addresses on her birth certificate. I accept the evidence of
    the witnesses, and I find that there is no  material  inconsistency  in
    what they have said; there are some minor  inconsistencies  over  dates
    and when Ms Brown was living where, but I find these are simply  errors
    of recall over events now some years in the past. There are no material
    inconsistencies as to the  nature  of  the  relationships  between  the
    parties.

22. It is evident that the claimant has a very close bond with his children
    and with the older child, even though he is not her biological  father.
    He is closely involved with their lives and spends a substantial amount
    of time caring for them. He does not, at present, live with  them,  but
    that appears to have been as a result  of  poor  advice  given  to  the
    family about his right to reside in Ms Brown's  property  and  then  to
    apply to vary the terms of bail.

23. I  acknowledge  that  there  is  little  direct  evidence  of  how  the
    deportation of the claimant would affect the children, but  any  expert
    evidence to that effect would of necessity be speculative. There is the
    direct evidence of how separation from him has  affected  them  in  the
    past, and I am satisfied that this would be likely to occur in the same
    way, not least as there would be no indication of when, if  ever,  they
    could be a family again.

24. As the claimant is unable to come within paragraphs 399 or 399A of  the
    immigration rules, the question then is whether there are  "exceptional
    circumstances  that  the  public  interest  in  deportation   will   be
    outweighed".  I have followed the guidance given in MF (Nigeria)  which
    clarifies at [44] that the immigration rules,  "are a complete code and
    that the exceptional circumstances to be considered  in  the  balancing
    exercise involve the application of a proportionality test as  required
    by the Strasbourg jurisprudence". This brings into play the application
    of article 8 jurisprudence as considered at [39]-[40] of  MF  (Nigeria)
    In considering "exceptional circumstances", it is important to note the
    observation made by the Master of the Rolls. He cited with approve  the
    decision of Sales J in Nagre v SSHD [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  in  the
    context of his observations of the repeated use by  the  ECtHR  of  the
    phrase "exceptional circumstances" , stating [42] and [43]:

         42. At para 40, Sales J referred to a statement  in  the  case  law
             that, in "precarious" cases, "it is likely to be  only  in  the
             most exceptional circumstances that the  removal  of  the  non-
             national family member will constitute a violation of  art  8".
             This has been  repeated  and  adopted  by  the  ECtHR  in  near
             identical terms in many cases. At paras 41 and 42, he said that
             in a "precarious" family life case, it is only in "exceptional"
             or "the most exceptional circumstances" that removal of the non-
             national family member will constitute a violation  of  article
             8.  In  our  view,  that  is  not  to  say  that  a   test   of
             exceptionality  is  being  applied.  Rather  it  is  that,   in
             approaching the question of whether removal is a  proportionate
             interference with an individual's article 8 rights, the  scales
             are heavily weighted in favour  of  deportation  and  something
             very compelling (which will be "exceptional")  is  required  to
             outweigh the public interest in removal. In our view, it is  no
             coincidence that the phrase "exceptional circumstances" is used
             in the new rules in  the  context  of  weighing  the  competing
             factors for and against deportation of foreign criminals.


         43. The word "exceptional" is often used to denote a departure from
             a general rule. The general rule  in  the  present  context  is
             that, in the case of a foreign prisoner to whom paras  399  and
             399A do not apply, very compelling reasons will be required  to
             outweigh the public interest in deportation.  These  compelling
             reasons are the "exceptional circumstances".

25. I therefore turn to consider whether there are, on the particular facts
    of this appeal, exceptional  circumstances  that  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation as provided for in paragraph 398.  In doing  so
    I bear in mind the factors identified in Maslov as referred  to  in  MF
    (Nigeria).

26. A primary consideration is the best interests of the three children  in
    this case but  I  bear  in  mind  that  it  is  one  capable  of  being
    outweighed.  Whilst the oldest girl is not the biological  daughter  of
    the claimant, nonetheless he has been the only  father  figure  in  her
    life since she was approximately 18 months of age.   The  younger  girl
    has also had only one father in her life and there is now a baby  of  a
    few months.  It is not suggested that the children should  be  expected
    to leave the United Kingdom, not  least  as  the  older  is  a  British
    citizen, and the younger girl has lived here  more  than  seven  years.
    Whilst as was accepted below, the relationship  has  been  through  its
    problems, nonetheless they have remained together as a family unit  and
    they are also close to the claimant's  mother.   I  consider  that  the
    claimant has shown a willingness to take his responsibility as a father
    seriously, whatever doubts there  may  also  be  as  a  result  of  his
    criminal background.

27. I bear in mind as also being a significant  and  weighty  consideration
    the very strong public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals
    and the need to deter foreign nationals from committing serious  crimes
    by leading them to understand that, whatever  the  other  circumstances
    one consequence for them  may  well  be  deportation.  The  role  of  a
    deportation order as an expression of society's  revulsion  at  serious
    crimes and in building public confidence in the  treatment  of  foreign
    citizens  who  have  committed  serious  crimes  is  also   a   weighty
    consideration to be taken into account.

28. In assessing these factors, I bear in mind fully  that  Parliament  has
    given  its  expression  of  its  will  through  the  automatic   deport
    provisions.  It is also a primary consideration, along  with  the  best
    interests of the children.

29. That is not to say that the public interest in deporting all those  who
    meet that criteria is the same and it is to be noted from the  decision
    of Laws LJ in SS (Nigeria) a significant proportion of the decision  is
    taken up with a  consideration  of  that  claimant's  poor  immigration
    history, poor character and the extent of his criminal conduct.

30. The claimant has been involved as  the  father  as  a  carer  of  three
    children.  I am satisfied, given the evidence of the  emotional  effect
    of his imprisonment had on the children that it is highly  to  leave  a
    powerful sense of an unexplained loss in the  case  of  the  two  older
    girls and a loss which is difficult to  rationalise  in  the  end.   In
    reality the children cannot be expected to  go  to  Jamaica,  they  are
    likely to be raised without a father figure  and  by  a  single  mother
    albeit with the help of the paternal grandmother.

31. The claimant has been in the United Kingdom for a significant  part  of
    his formative years and his connections with Jamaica to  which  he  has
    not returned are slight.  He has been integrated in this country and if
    returned it would be, in effect, as a stranger.  There is no indication
    that he has any close family there.  Whilst he may be able to fend  for
    himself, I consider it is likely that he would  find  it  difficult  to
    integrate into the country again.

32. In contrast with what he would find in Jamaica, he has  in  the  United
    Kingdom a strong  set  of  family  and  other  connections  here  whose
    presence is likely to be a positive factor.  He has solid ties to  this
    country in terms of his partner and children, and in his  ties  to  his
    mother and her husband, as well as a network of other relatives. He has
    also, as the First-tier Tribunal found, shown remorse  and  is  at  low
    risk of re-offending.  The serious offence of which  he  was  convicted
    took place in 2011.  He has not offended since then.  I  bear  in  mind
    the sentencing remarks of the judge and I attach significant weight  to
    them in assessing the seriousness of the offending but he has now as  a
    result of the Probation report been found by the First-tier Tribunal to
    be at low risk.

33. The removal of the claimant will result  in  exclusion  for  a  lengthy
    period, which will be of  real  significance  given  the  ages  of  the
    children concerned.  Here, the  length  of  the  parental  relationship
    between the claimant and his  two  older  children  is  of  significant
    duration; he has in fact been present during the vast majority of their
    lives and they have lived with him, except while he was in prison.  The
    reality is that their family life with the claimant will effectively be
    severed by his deportation.

34. These factors must, however, be balanced against  the  significant  and
    weighty public interest in deporting foreign criminals, and  the  other
    factors in favour of deportation set out above. In addition, while  the
    claimant has lived here for  a  substantial  period,  and  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain, his presence here was not lawful  prior  to
    that. That is a factor which weighs against him, but not to  any  great
    degree; he was  under  18  when  he  came  here,  and  his  status  was
    regularised.  It is not in his  favour  that  he  was  convicted  of  a
    serious offence as an adult. That said, this is not a case in which the
    claimant's position here was "precarious", given that he had indefinite
    leave to remain.

35. I bear in mind the circumstances of the offence.  This  was  a  serious
    assault, and one which rightly attracted a significant sentence.

36. Weighing these factors, I find that the consequences of deportation  to
    the claimant's children, when taken with the effect on his partner, are
    such that it would be unduly harsh and thus in all the circumstances of
    this case, I am satisfied that the undoubtedly strong  public  interest
    in deporting the claimant is outweighed in the particular circumstances
    of this appeal, given the effect on his children. I therefore find that
    there are exceptional circumstances, and thus the  claimant  meets  the
    requirements of paragraph 398 of the Immigration  Rules.   I  therefore
    allow the appeal on that basis.

Summary of Conclusions

 1) For the reasons set out  above  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law and it is set aside.

 2) I re-make the decision by allowing the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.
