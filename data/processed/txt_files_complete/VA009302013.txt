Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms K Cronin, Counsel instructed by Messrs Birnberg
                    Peirce & Partners Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant a citizen of Iran born  on  12  July
    1928 against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge N J Bennett  who
    sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  5  June  2013  and  in   a   subsequent
    determination promulgated on 9 July 2013, dismissed the appeal  of  the
    Appellant against the decision of the Respondent dated 21 November 2012
    to refuse the Appellant entry clearance  as  a  visitor,  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules applicable being as  set  out  at  paragraphs  41(i),
    (ii), and (vi) of the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended).   In
    summary the First-tier Tribunal Judge concluded that the Appellant  did
    not genuinely intend to visit her daughters and their families  in  the
    United Kingdom for a period of only six to seven weeks and then  return
    to Iran.

2.    At  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  no  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer was present.   Thus  and  as  confirmed  within  the
    determination, there was no cross-examination of the  evidence  of  the
    witnesses comprising the Sponsor Taraneh Sayyah Khabisi and her  sister
    Parvaneh Sayyah Khabisi who gave oral evidence before  the  Judge  that
    included the adoption of their  prior  respective  witness  statements.
    Their mother, the Appellant was also the grandmother of her  daughters'
    children.  The evidence was that she had a special  close  relationship
    with her grandson the son of  the  Sponsor.   As  pointed  out  in  the
    challenge to the Judge's decision there were no inconsistencies  relied
    on by him as  to  the  daughters'  evidence  either  within  their  own
    evidence or as between each of them in  their  statements  and/or  oral
    evidence.

3.   The Judge in his determination at paragraph 31 concluded that:

          "The  Appellant's  economic   personal   circumstances   are   of
         considerable importance when considering her intentions  about  her
         visit".


4.   Evidence was also given by another of the Appellant's daughters  Nasrin
    that it  was  contended  was  entirely  consistent  with  her  sisters'
    evidence.

5.   Nasrin confirmed in her statement as to why her mother was  genuine  in
    her wish to visit her daughters and why her life was so rooted in  Iran
    such that she would not remain in the  United  Kingdom  and  definitely
    return at the end of her visit.  Her evidence specifically referred  to
    both the Appellant's personal and financial circumstances.

6.   Nasrin was married with two children and was a housewife.  Her  husband
    was self-employed distributing gold and  silver  products  in  Iran  in
    relation to which documentary evidence was attached.

7.   Nasrin and her other siblings lived in Iran and  visited  their  mother
    daily with their children, when sometimes they would stay over at their
    mother's house.

8.   The Appellant saved money at home before she  opened  a  bank  account.
    Six years previously she opened a bank account with Bank Melli for  the
    purpose of receiving a subsidy which the Iranian government paid to all
    citizens.  Previously she had opened an account with Bank Pasargad  for
    the purpose of applying for a visit visa to the UK.   Nasrin  confirmed
    her mother's balances.  She further confirmed the reason why her mother
    the Appellant, had every incentive to return to Iran after a  visit  to
    the UK primarily due to the support she received from her children  and
    grandchildren in Iran and her life in Iran.  Nasrin emphasised that her
    mother would not want to remain in the UK.

9.   Parvaneh Khabisi's evidence was aid to be consistent with the  evidence
    of Nasrin as to their mother's personal  circumstances.   Parvaneh  was
    married and had two daughters.  Her mother the Appellant had six  other
    children.  All Parvaneh's siblings except for Hossin and Taraneh  lived
    in Iran.  Hossin had lived in the USA for many years.

10.  Parvaneh had not seen her mother since 2010 and was  very  anxious  for
    her to visit as she could  not  return  to  Iran  having  been  granted
    refugee status.  She could not afford the cost of travelling to another
    country to visit her mother.

11.  Parvaneh stressed that her mother had every intention of  returning  to
    Iran after the visit having lived in  Iran  all  her  life  and  having
    enjoyed very strong ties and connections with Iran.

12.  Parvaneh stressed that the majority of  the  Appellant's  children  and
    grandchildren of which there were fifteen resided in Iran.  They were a
    very close-knit family and her mother enjoyed spending  time  with  her
    children and grandchildren.  Recently Parvaneh's sister's 10  year  old
    grandson had died of brain  cancer  so  the  Appellant  was  even  more
    needed.

13.  Parvaneh's evidence continued that her mother was very active  for  her
    years and enjoyed  planting  flowers  and  socialising  with  her  many
    friends.  She owned a property and had regular income from  the  rental
    of two flats in relation to which she received ï¿½500 monthly.

14.  It was Taraneh's evidence consistent with that of her sisters that  she
    was married and had a son who was 8 years old.  She and  her  son  were
    recognised as refugees.  She kept in close contact with her  mother  by
    telephone and had always enjoyed a  close  relationship  with  her  and
    missed her very much.  It had been two and a half years since she  last
    saw her mother and she was  very  anxious  for  her  to  visit  because
    Taraneh for obvious reasons could not return to Iran.  Her son was  the
    Appellant's youngest grandchild and they had a close relationship.   He
    used to see his grandmother regularly when he lived in Iran and  missed
    her a lot.  In common with her sister  Parvaneh  and  contrary  to  the
    suggestion raised by the Respondent, it would be impossible for her  to
    arrange to visit her mother in  another  country.   Both  she  and  her
    husband were unemployed and unable to afford the cost of travelling  to
    another country.

  15. Having initially failed in her application for  permission  to  appeal
      the First-tier Tribunal's determination, a subsequent application  for
      judicial review to the Administrative Court  of  the  High  Court  was
      successful.  In giving her decision Mrs Justice  Carr  DBE  had  inter
      alia this to say:


         "I am satisfied there is an arguable case which has  a  reasonable
         prospect of success that both the decision of  the  Upper  Tribunal
         refusing permission and the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         against which permission to appeal was sought  are  wrong  in  law.
         The claimant is an octogenarian Iranian national who has  lived  in
         Iran all her life.  She seeks to challenge the finding that she was
         not genuinely seeking entry for only a limited  period  of  six  to
         seven weeks to visit two of  her  six  children  and  grandchildren
         living in the United  Kingdom.   It  is  arguable  that  there  was
         procedural irregularity and unfairness for the reasons set  out  in
         the detailed statement of grounds.  In particular oral and  written
         evidence of the claimant's daughters was  not  challenged  and  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge had not addressed their evidence or  make
         any findings as to why their evidence  should  be  rejected  (other
         than his comment at paragraph 34 that he was not obliged to  accept
         such  evidence  on  matters  that  could  and  should   have   been
         established by documents).  The documentary deficiencies relied  on
         by the First-tier Tribunal Judge was not put to the claimant or her
         witnesses.  The refusal of permission  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
         appeal appears to recognise the arguability of at least some of the
         grounds relied upon ...


         The consequences to the octogenarian claimant are  significant  in
         that  she  is  otherwise  unlikely  to   see   her   daughters   or
         grandchildren again".


16.  The decision of the Upper Tribunal to refuse permission to  appeal  was
    therefore quashed and by  a  decision  dated  7  April  2014  the  Vice
    President of the Upper Tribunal granted permission  to  appeal  in  the
    light of the decision of the High Court in this case.

17.  The Respondent's Rule 24 response as set out in her letter  of  14  May
    2014 stated that in  summary  she  would  submit  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge directed himself appropriately and  had  considered  all
    the oral evidence and documentary evidence which was placed before  him
    and that it was open to the Judge  to  take  an  adverse  view  of  the
    documents if they were inherently unreliable.

18.  Prior to the hearing of this appeal before  me  the  Tribunal  received
    attached to letters respectively dated 5 and 6  August  2014  from  the
    Appellant's solicitors, two  bundles  of  documents  that  included  an
    updated witness statement from the Sponsor Taraneh Khabisi and  various
    documents relating to the family situation of the Appellant in Iran.

19.  Thus the appeal came before me on 6 August 2014 and my first  task  was
    to decide whether the determination of the First-tier  Judge  disclosed
    an error or errors on a point  of  law  such  as  may  have  materially
    affected the outcome of the appeal.


The Parties' Submissions

20.  Ms Cronin opened her submissions by  pointing  out  that  she  had  the
    originals of the documents referred to in the two bundles before me and
    they were provided to Mr Melvin for his inspection.

21.  Ms Cronin submitted that the primary error of the First-tier Judge  was
    that he appeared to consider that the only evidence he needed to assess
    and give weight to, was the documentary evidence as opposed to the oral
    evidence that stood alongside it.

22.  In any event, the Judge's approach to the documentary  evidence  before
    him revealed errors of law, not least mistakes of fact triggered by his
    failure  to  take  account  of  the  relevant  documents   within   the
    Appellant's bundle.

23.  Ms Cronin continued that it was one of those cases  where  it  was  the
    failure of  the  Judge  to  consider  holistically  the  evidence  that
    included the live unchallenged evidence of the two witnesses with which
    the Judge had taken  no  issue.  Had  the  Judge  taken  these  matters
    properly into account, it would and should have been clear to him  this
    was an Appellant who had a very real intention to return to Iran on  or
    before the expiry of her visitor's visa.

 24.    Ms Cronin further submitted that there were errors of approach  with
    the manner in which the Judge dealt with  the  Appellant's  income  and
    resources in Iran.

25.  There was a final error in respect of his consideration  of  Article  8
    of the ECHR.  At paragraph 1 of the determination  the  Judge  did  not
    accept there was any family life between the Appellant and her daughter
    and grandchildren.  That had to be wrong.  It was not a requirement  of
    family life, that one had to live with a person and the Judge failed to
    have regard to the fact that the daughters in the United  Kingdom  were
    refugees who could not live with their mother,  a part of the price for
    them of fleeing Iran where they had previously seen her daily  together
    with the grandchildren.  It was relevant  that  the  daughters  in  the
    United Kingdom were refugees in this case and Ms Cronin pointed to  the
    obligation of family contact between family members when as  here,  you
    had refugees who could not return to their home country.

26.  Ms Cronin took issue with the observation of the Judge that they  might
    all meet up elsewhere, that she maintained was inappropriate, not least
    because of the high cost of travel for all the family concerned and  as
    such it was a disproportionate requirement.

27.  With reference to the decision of the Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  in
    MNM* 00/TH/02423 to which the "Surendran Guidelines" were annexed.   Ms
    Cronin maintained this was a Surendran guidance  case  in  relation  to
    which she referred to the role of what were then known as  Adjudicators
    at paragraphs 5 and 7 of the guidance.

28.  I pause there, because this was indeed a matter in  relation  to  which
    Mrs Justice Carr considered that the claim raised an important point of
    principle of practice namely, the question of the extent to and  manner
    in which a First-tier Tribunal Judge could deal with unchallenged  oral
    evidence and questions of procedural fairness in hearings conducted  in
    the absence of a Presenting Officer.

29.  Indeed paragraph 5 of the Surendran Guidelines  states  that  where  no
    matters of credibility are raised in the letter of refusal but, from  a
    reading of the papers the Special Adjudicator  himself  considers  that
    there are matters of credibility arising therefrom,  he  should  simply
    point these matters out to the representative  and  ask  that  they  be
    dealt with either in examination of the Appellant or in submissions.

30.  Paragraph 7 of the guidance  states  that  where  having  received  the
    evidence or submissions in relation to matters which he  has  drawn  to
    the attention of the representatives the Special Adjudicator  considers
    clarification is necessary,  then  he  should  be  at  liberty  to  ask
    questions for the purposes  of  seeking  clarification.   The  Tribunal
    emphasised however that it  was  not  the  Judge's  function  to  raise
    matters  which  a  Presenting  Officer  might  have  raised  in  cross-
    examination had he been present.

31.  Ms Cronin pointed out in that  regard  that  at  paragraph  34  of  his
    determination, the Judge stated as follows:

         "I am not obliged to accept oral evidence about matters that could
         and should have been  established  by  documents,  particularly  in
         circumstances where the Respondent had said in his decision that he
         was not satisfied that the Appellant had other family  living  with
         her in Iran".


32.  I would agree with Ms Cronin.  It was indeed very troubling as  it  was
    not a question of obligation.  This had to be a misdirection in that it
    was necessary to look at  the  evidence  on  its  own  terms,  and  not
    disregard it if it had been accepted and/or not challenged in the  live
    evidence particularly as here, in circumstances where the live evidence
    was tendered as corroborative of  the  documentary  evidence.   I  also
    share Ms Cronin's view that there  was  no  an  indication  within  the
    determination, that the Judge disbelieved  the  live  evidence  and  it
    could be inferred that were it otherwise, he would  have  proceeded  to
    set out his reasons for so concluding.

33.  It was also to be noted that in the final  sentence  of  paragraph  34,
    the Judge stated that he was "not given an explanation for the  absence
    of documents showing current residence" but as identified by Ms Cronin,
    there was documentary evidence before him that the  Judge  had  clearly
    overlooked that dovetailed with the live evidence before  him.  He  had
    therefore misdirected himself in law.

34.  Mr Melvin was brief but to the point in his submissions.  He relied  on
    the Rule 24 response  and  maintained  that  in  the  determination  as
    reflected by way of example at paragraphs 31  and  32,  the  Judge  had
    given reasons why he believed that the Appellant would  not  return  to
    Iran if issued with a visa.  It is as well therefore to set  out  below
    those paragraphs:

         "32.  Her  personal  circumstances  include  the  location  of  her
             family.  The starting point  must  be  that  an  octogenarian,
             would probably like  to  be  surrounded  by  as  many  of  her
             children as possible.  I was told that she has eight  children
             but one of them lived in America, but the Sponsor  her  sister
             lived here and that the remainder lived  in  Iran  with  their
             families.  Her  bundle  contains  documents  relating  to  the
             children who are said to live in  Iran.   Very  few  of  these
             documents show  that  any  of  these  children  were  normally
             resident in Iran at  the  date  of  the  decision.   With  the
             exception of Hassan's gas bill for January 2013 there  are  no
             routine documents that  show  this,  such  as  utility  bills,
             payslips, bank statements and tax  documents.   Her  daughter,
             Nazrin, produced her husband's licence  to  deal  in  precious
             metals which was issued in January 2011, her medical treatment
             booklet  which  was  renewed  on  17  December  2012,  and   a
             certificate from her daughter's university which was issued on
             25 February  2013  and  which  shows  that  her  daughter  was
             enrolled at the Islamic Azad University.  Elizabeth Farrell, a
             senior caseworker at the Appellant's solicitors, says  in  her
             statement that she spoke to the Appellant and to her daughter,
             Nazrin on 21 May 2013,  they  lived  in  Iran  and  that  they
             returned their statements from Iran.

         33.  The other documents that  the  Appellant  produced  about  her
             children, such as the document showing ownership  of  property
             and identity  cards,  are  of  little  value  in  establishing
             current residence in Iran because they are either  undated  or
             were not recently issued.  For example Hassan's identity  card
             is valid until January 2020 but it does not show where it  was
             issued.  The ownership document relating to his apartment does
             not show current ownership it only shows him to have been  the
             owner of the property in June 2010, when he executed a further
             charge in favour of Bank Saman.  Ownership of  property  in  a
             country does not in any  event  establish  residence  in  that
             country.  His student identity cards do  not  show  when  they
             were issued.  The photographs are  undated.   As  the  Sponsor
             says in her statement that she  appeared  in  three  of  these
             photographs they, at least, are not of recent origin".

35.  Mr Melvin continued that if I was against him, then he was  "happy  for
    you to evaluate the evidence and  reach  a  fresh  decision".   However
    following Ms Cronin's submissions, Mr Melvin informed me that if errors
    of law were found such that the decision of the  First-tier  Judge  was
    set aside, he would on reflection wish me to remit the case back to the
    First-tier Tribunal given his understanding there were other  relatives
    of the Appellant seeking entry clearance to the United Kingdom.

36.  In that regard, I reminded Mr Melvin  that  the  Tribunal  were  solely
    concerned with the evidence as it  stood  before  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer as at the date of decision and I was not persuaded that justice
    required in such circumstances the case should be remitted.  This was a
    case that had been in the appeal track for some two years.  Further  my
    understanding was that cases remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  would
    not be heard until January or February 2015 at the latest.  It followed
    that if a fresh decision was to be made it would be just and  expedient
    that it be made by the Upper Tribunal.

Assessment

37.  At the close of the parties' submissions I  was  able  to  inform  them
    that I was satisfied that the determination of the First-tier Judge did
    disclose errors on a point of law such as to have been material to  the
    outcome of the appeal and that in  such  circumstances  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's determination  was  to  be  set  aside  and   that  in  such
    circumstances it was appropriate to proceed to make  a  fresh  decision
    and that such decision would be to allow the Appellant's appeal.

38.  I pointed out that my  reasons  for  so  deciding  would  follow  in  a
    determination that I now give.

39.   Upon  my  own  careful  consideration  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination and the bundle of documents that were placed  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge for his consideration and for the reasons not
    least identified by Ms Cronin with which I entirely agree, I find  that
    the First-tier Judge's determination was vitiated by errors of law such
    as to warrant the setting aside of his decision.

40.  In so concluding, I appreciate that the Judge's task was  not  assisted
    by the absence of a Presenting Officer  to  represent  the  Respondent.
    Further he was faced  with  a  large  bundle  of  documents  comprising
    hundreds of pages and whilst his determination reflects the effort that
    he made to disseminate them, it is regrettable that the  tenor  of  his
    reasoning was to attach great weight to them in circumstances where  he
    stated at paragraph 34 that he was "not obliged to accept oral evidence
    about matters that could and should have been established by  documents
    ...".  It was also regrettable  that  as  I  have  found  upon  my  own
    consideration of the documents, he did not in the event give  them  the
    anxious  scrutiny  that  they  merited  in  the  formulation   of   his
    conclusions.

41.    At paragraph 32 the Judge made the assumption  as  to  what  informed
    the Appellant's intentions by saying that "the starting point  must  be
    that an octogenarian would probably like to be surrounded by as many of
    her children as possible" and then at paragraph 34 the  Judge  accepted
    that one daughter Nasrin and her family were "probably living  in  Iran
    at the time of the Respondent's decision" and  that  "Hassan  may  have
    produced an isolated utility bill but I do  not  accept  that  this  is
    sufficient to establish that he is probably in Iran".

42.  The Judge also made reference at paragraph  32,  to  having  been  told
    that the Appellant had eight children and that one  of  them  lived  in
    America but the Sponsor and her sister lived here, the remainder  lived
    in Iran with their families.

43.  I am satisfied that the Judge misdirected himself as  to  the  evidence
    in the above regard and also set up a false  set  of  assumptions,  not
    least because it might well be sufficient for a parent to have only one
    child in the country as an incentive to return.

44.  Pages A100 (b) to A121  of  the  Appellant's  bundle,  all  related  to
    documentation dealing with Nasrin and from which it  is  apparent  they
    included the Guild card for Nasrin's husband and his ID  documentation,
    birth documents of  her  children,  documents  dealing  with  a  social
    insurance organisation and a  medical  treatment  booklet  for  herself
    (A116) that had been issued in 2009 and renewed  in  2012.   There  was
    also a student card for her daughter (A118) and for her son (A120).

45.  In addition and in terms of Hassan, there appeared at B22  an  unsigned
    statement giving his address, his wife's  name  and  that  of  his  two
    children and his ID card (B24) and birth documents of his children.

46.  There was also documentary evidence as to  ownership  of  an  apartment
    (B28) registered in 2001 and a mortgage dated 2010.

47.  At B34 there was a property document/ownership deed for his  wife  with
    similar dates.  A gas  bill  appeared  at  (B40  that  the  Judge  made
    reference to).  There also appeared Hassan's son's  ID  card  valid  to
    2012 and that of his daughter at B42.

48.  Further there were documents not  referred  to  at  all  by  the  Judge
    relating to the Appellant's daughter Shamshamsi Khabisi and her family.
     There was her statement (B46), there  followed  birth  documents,  her
    university ID card (B51) evidence confirming her ownership of  property
    registered in 1999  and  renewed  in  2011  (B53).   Further  ownership
    documents  at  B67.   The  Judge  appears  to  have   overlooked   this
    significant aspect of and evidence relating to the  Appellant's  family
    in Iran.

49.  I would thus agree with  Ms  Cronin  who  submitted,  that  taking  the
    evidence as a whole, the  Judge  had  before  him  an  array  of  clear
    evidence as to the Appellant's family circumstances in Iran  not  least
    that of her children and grandchildren, sons-in-law etc. in Iran.

50.  It was indeed in consequence,  that  Ms  Cronin  made  the  appropriate
    observation that this was one of those cases where it was  the  failure
    of the Judge to consider holistically the evidence that had  undermined
    and vitiated the determination.

51.    I am further satisfied, that  in  terms  of  the  documentation  that
    reflected the financial material, the Judge was too prescriptive  about
    this evidence.  For example at paragraph 35, all the evidence of rental
    income was disregarded despite the volume of documentation  before  him
    in this regard covering the period 2010 to 2012 (A16 to A36).  The very
    first of those documents was a receipt that predated the lease document
    for the first  property.   This  showed  indeed  that  there  were  two
    apartments in the same building, one on the first floor and  the  other
    on the second.  There had been an error on the part of the estate agent
    to the property in that regard that he had subsequently corrected in  a
    further document that appeared in the bundle before the Judge.

52.  At A41 there was a copy lease which showed the lease had to be  renewed
    every three years so that the fact it was a three year  lease  was  not
    inconsistent of the tenant being there in advance  of  that  particular
    lease having been signed.

53.  At paragraph 35 the  Judge  considered  that  the  evidence  about  the
    Appellant's rental income  was  unsatisfactory  as  he  considered  the
    evidence provided as to the income the Appellant derived from the flats
    was confused. I reaching that conclusion, the Judge used  the  exchange
    rate given in the notice of decision in his calculations, thus  finding
    that the Appellant did not receive a monthly rental income equating  to
    ï¿½500 sterling as claimed.

54.  However and as explained by Ms Cronin, this depended  on  the  exchange
    rate one was using to make that conversion.  In fact the exchange  rate
    the Sponsor was giving in evidence before the Judge did equate to  ï¿½500
    based on a free  market  exchange  rate  whereas  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer and the Judge were using an official exchange rate.  Ms  Cronin
    continued "How it correlates to English money does not correlate in any
    event to the Appellant's incentive to return.  Her incentive to  return
    is how much the Appellant earns in Iran and not how it  corresponds  to
    here".  I would fully agree with that observation.

55.  In any event, the evidence before  the  Judge  as  to  the  Appellant's
    dealings with various banks, did not on  my  reading  of  the  evidence
    before him, reflect a lack of funds but a lack of trust on the part  of
    the Appellant in the Iranian banking system.  This was indeed  evidence
    supported by the written and oral  evidence  of  the  Sponsor  and  her
    sister at the hearing before the First-tier Judge.   I  find  therefore
    that there were errors of approach on the part of the First-tier  Judge
    in relation to the Appellant's income and resources in Iran.

56.  It is also apparent to me that the Judge's conclusion that he  did  not
    accept there  was  any  family  life  between  the  Appellant  and  her
    daughters or between the Appellant and her grandchildren was in  error.
    In that regard I would fully endorse Ms Cronin's submissions to which I
    have above referred.

57.  I find that in setting aside the First-tier Judge's  determination  and
    in making a fresh decision, I do so not least for the  reasons  that  I
    have identified above in concluding the First-tier Judge erred in law.

58.  I am also reminded that the Tribunal in W  (Ghana)  [2004]  UKIAT  0005
    pointed out that the provisions of paragraphs 41(i)  and  (ii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules  were  two  separate  requirements.   They  were  not
    interchangeable:

              "That accords with common sense.  One can think of  a  person
         who intends to leave at the end of his visit but does  not  have  a
         genuine purpose for his visit.  Equally however,  it  accords  with
         common sense to accept that there is some degree of overlapping: if
         a person genuinely intends a  visit  for  a  limited  period,  that
         entails that he will have an intention to leave at the end of  that
         period".


59.  It is apparent to me that  the  purpose  of  the  Appellant's  intended
    visit was clear.  This was an octogenarian  Iranian  national  who  had
    lived in Iran all her life, and who wanted  to  see  her  children  and
    grandchildren in the  United  Kingdom  albeit  for  a  limited  period.
    Nothing could be more understandable than that a mother and grandmother
    would be anxious to achieve this objective in the time left to her  and
    mindful that her daughters could not come to Iran in that they  enjoyed
    refugee status in the United Kingdom.

60.  I have also reminded myself that  in  Ahsrif  01/TH/3465  the  Tribunal
    pointed out that:

              "The whole point of a family visit is that the  existence  of
         family ties will normally furnish the reason for the  visit,  since
         it is hardly surprising that members of a family separated by  many
         thousands of miles may from time to time wish to see each other".


61.   I  am  satisfied  that  clearly  this  was  the   situation   in   the
    circumstances in this case.

62.  The age and situation of the Appellant may have  aroused  suspicion  in
    the mind of the Entry Clearance Officer  as  to  whether  there  was  a
    genuine intention to return to Iran at the  expiry  of  the  visa,  but
    there surely had to be extrinsic evidence to justify such a  suspicion.
    Being an 86 year old cannot possibly be the basis itself for justifying
    the refusal of a visitor's visa or otherwise there  could  never  be  a
    successful application by an elderly single person to visit loved  ones
    in the United Kingdom.

63.  Having considered the evidence in its totality,  I  therefore  conclude
    for the above reasons that the Appellant has  in  the  event,  provided
    sufficient evidence to the requisite standard of  proof  to  show  that
    only a genuine visit for family purposes was intended.

64.  On the totality of the evidence before me and  bearing  in  mind  where
    the burden of proof lies, I find the Appellant has satisfied me  as  to
    the true purpose of her proposed visit and that  she  would  intend  to
    leave the United Kingdom upon completion of her visit.

65.  I therefore find that  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  was  not  in
    accordance with the law and the Immigration Rules  applicable  to  this
    case.

Decision

66.  The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

67.  I set aside the decision.

68.  I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
