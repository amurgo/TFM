                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Moran made
    following a hearing at North Shields on 27th March 2018.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 10th June 1982.  On  4th
    October 2016 he made an application for indefinite leave to  remain  on
    the basis of having ten years' continuous residence in the UK.  He  was
    refused on 17th October 2017 on the grounds that he did  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276B, namely that  he  had  not  accrued  ten
    years' lawful residence and because  he  fell  for  refusal  under  the
    general grounds for refusal having made  false  representations  in  an
    entrepreneur visa application made on 9th October 2011.

 3. Judge Moran said that he was not required to decide whether  there  had
    been a break in continuity of  lawful  residence  as  asserted  by  the
    respondent because he was satisfied that the  appellant  had  knowingly
    made false representations and relied on false documents in  2011.   On
    that basis he dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in law in relying on the entrepreneur application because  it
    had been withdrawn and in any event had wrongfully concluded  that  the
    appellant had acted dishonestly.  Permission to appeal was  granted  by
    Judge Andrew on 3rd August 2018.

 5. On 26th September 2018 the respondent served a  reply  submitting  that
    the fact that the appellant had subsequently withdrawn  an  application
    was immaterial since withdrawn or not he had relied on false  documents
    in a previous application and would fail suitability on that basis.

Submissions

 6. Mr Izevbizua relied on his grounds and argued that the judge was  wrong
    to have made findings on an application which had  been  withdrawn  and
    said that the appellant continued to maintain that he had no  knowledge
    of any wrongdoing.

 7. Mrs Petersen relied on her Rule 24 response.

Findings and Conclusions

 8. The Immigration Judge did not err in law.

 9. Under S/LTR.4.2 of Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  an  applicant
    will normally be refused on grounds of suitability if he has made false
    representations or failed to disclose any material fact in  a  previous
    application for entry clearance, leave to enter, leave to remain  or  a
    variation of leave or in a previous human rights claim.

10. The judge set out the appellant's immigration history.  He  arrived  on
    14th July 2006 with leave as a student and was granted further  periods
    of leave until making an application on 7th October 2011 for leave as a
    Tier  1  (Entrepreneur).   On  3rd  January  2013  he  made  an  asylum
    application and this was refused on 7th October 2014.

11. The appellant said that the entrepreneur application was withdrawn when
    he  made  his  asylum  application  and  it  should  never  have   been
    adjudicated upon.

12. The judge considered the  documentation  which  had  been  provided  in
    relation to the  alleged  fraud  including  a  letter  from  Hargreaves
    Lansdown addressed to the appellant thanking him for investing �207,516
    which was available for withdrawal at any  time.   The  refusal  letter
    states that Hargreaves Lansdown say that an account was set up  in  the
    appellant's name but the  balance  never  exceeded  �30  and  that  any
    documentation stating otherwise was false.

13. The judge recorded the written and oral evidence  in  some  detail  and
    concluded that the appellant had been dishonest.

14. At paragraph 26 he wrote

         "It is for the respondent to prove that  AK  knowingly  made  false
         representations and relied on false documents.  I find that this is
         proved to a high standard.  It is possible that  AK  may  not  have
         created the documents himself.  He may have paid someone to  obtain
         a visa for him but if he did so I am satisfied that he did so  with
         full knowledge that it was not being done legitimately."

15. The judge was plainly entitled and indeed required to make a finding on
    the issue.  Paragraph 276B(3) requires that an applicant does not  fall
    for refusal under the general grounds for refusal.  On the findings  of
    the Immigration Judge, the  appellant  made  false  representations  in
    2011.  The fact  that  he  subsequently  withdrew  the  application  is
    irrelevant.

16. Although the appellant continues to argue that the judge was  wrong  to
    find that he had acted dishonestly he is simply attempting  to  reargue
    his case.  Disagreement with the judges decision is  not  a  foundation
    for establishing an error of law.

Decision

The original Immigration Judge did not err in  law.   His  decision  stands.
The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
