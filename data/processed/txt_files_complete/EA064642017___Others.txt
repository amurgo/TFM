For the Appellant:     Mr I Ali of Counsel, instructed by M & K Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Ms S Chuna, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Watson promulgated on 14 June 2018, in which  the  Appellants'  appeals
    against the decisions to refuse to issue them with an EEA family permit
    under  Regulation  7  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2016 (the  "EEA  Regulations")  dated  12  June  2017  were
    dismissed.  In the hearing before UTJ Gleeson and myself on 7  February
    2019, an error of law was found  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the appeal relisted to remake.  That decision is  attached
    as an annex and provides the background to the proceedings.



The appeal

 2. Further to Regulation 12 of the EEA Regulations, a person  is  entitled
    to an EEA family permit, on application to an entry clearance  officer,
    if they are the family member of an EEA national residing in the United
    Kingdom in accordance with the EEA Regulations.  So far as relevant  to
    the present appeal,  Regulation  7(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  EEA  Regulations
    defines a "family member" as a direct descendent of a person who  is  a
    dependent of the same person.

 3. The Respondent has accepted that the Appellants are direct  descendants
    of the Sponsor and that the  Sponsor  is  an  EEA  national  exercising
    treaty rights in the United Kingdom and a qualified person.   The  only
    remaining issue in the appeals is whether the Appellants are  dependent
    on the Sponsor.

 4. In order to establish dependency, the Court of Appeal confirmed in  the
    case of Lim v Entry Clearance Officer Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383, that
    it is not enough simply to show  that  financial  support  is  in  fact
    provided by the EU citizen to the family  member,  but  also  that  the
    family member must need the support from his or her relatives in  order
    to meet his or her basic needs.  If the  person  can  support  himself,
    there is no dependency, even if he is given financial support by the EU
    citizen as the additional resources would not be  necessary  to  enable
    him to meet his  basic  needs.   If  a  person  is  unable  to  support
    themselves from their own resources, the court will not need to ask why
    that is the case, save perhaps where there is an abuse of  rights.   If
    for example a person chooses not to seek employment  and  become  self-
    supporting, that is irrelevant.

 5. The Appellants case is in  essence  that  they  are  fully  financially
    dependent on the Sponsor, neither they nor  their  mother  having  ever
    worked and are without any other source of income.   Until  January  of
    this year, the First and Third Appellants were in  full-time  education
    at a sewing school and until October of last year, the Second Appellant
    was in full-time education doing an IT course.  The Sponsor's  evidence
    is that all three of the Appellants are looking for work  but  have  as
    yet not found employment given difficult market conditions in Pakistan.

 6. In terms of financial support, there are receipts for  money  transfers
    from the Sponsor, mainly to the Second Appellant,  the  earliest  being
    dated 31 July 2015  in  the  sum  of  �637  and  further  receipts  for
    transfers in the region of  �600  in  September  2015,  November  2015,
    December 2015, February  2016,  June  2016,  July  2016,  August  2016,
    October 2016, December 2016, June 2017, August  2017,  September  2017,
    November 2017, December 2017, February 2018, July 2018 (in  the  higher
    amount of �927), August 2018, January 2019 (in  the  higher  amount  of
    �1136) and March 2019.  The Sponsor's evidence is that  money  is  sent
    regularly in the name of the Second Appellant as he is the  eldest  and
    only male family member and has to travel into the city to collect  the
    money.  On one occasion the  money  was  sent  to  the  Sponsor's  wife
    directly, who was accompanied by the Second Appellant  to  collect  it.
    On three occasions between November 2015 and February 2016,  the  money
    was transferred to a M Qadeer, who is said to be a  family  friend  and
    next-door  neighbour  in  Pakistan  who  was  asked  to   collect   the
    remittances during a period in which the Second  Appellant  was  absent
    caring for his paternal aunt.

 7. In his affidavit dated 4 March 2019, the Second Appellant confirms that
    he collects money sent by the Sponsor from the money exchange or  bank.
    He states that it is a cultural norm that the male of the  house  would
    collect the money because they live in a rural area and it would not be
    convenient for the First or Third Appellants or their mother to  travel
    to the city alone to do so.  The Second Appellant passes on  the  money
    to his mother as head of the family in Pakistan.  He further  confirmed
    that the entire family is financially dependent on the Sponsor

 8. In addition, the Sponsor visits the Appellants in  Pakistan  relatively
    regularly and on the last occasion in August  2018,  he  stayed  for  a
    month and withdrew �2000 from his account in the United Kingdom to take
    with him to give to his family.

 9. In relation to the Appellants' studies,  there  are  letters  from  the
    Kashmir Vocational Institute and Training Centre female  dated  7  July
    2017 in respect of the First and Third Appellants, and from the  Chinar
    Institute of Modern Technologies dated 5 July 2017; all of which  state
    that the  Sponsor  is  registered  as  the  father  of  the  respective
    Appellant and has been paying the school fees and has  regular  contact
    with the Institute.  Although these letters are identically worded, the
    Respondent has  not  directly  taken  issue  with  their  authenticity.
    However, Ms Chuna submitted that little weight should  be  attached  to
    these documents on the  basis  that  they  are  not  supported  by  any
    receipts showing payment of fees, identification of how much  the  fees
    were or how they were paid.

10. In his written  evidence,  the  Sponsor  said  that  he  has  regularly
    financially supported his family in Pakistan, from the time when he was
    in Spain and in the United Kingdom.  The money is sent to  cover  their
    basic living expenses, including food and clothing,  and  pay  for  the
    childrens' school fees and school equipment.  The Sponsor has  remained
    financially responsible for the Appellants as his wife is  not  working
    and is also dependent on him.

11. In his oral evidence, the Sponsor confirmed the current position of the
    Appellants in Pakistan, that they had finished their education and were
    seeking work.  He stated that at present, he had not reduced the amount
    of financial support he  was  sending  following  completion  of  their
    studies, but may do so in the future.  He stated that he normally sends
    around �600, but recently had sent more for medical treatment as one of
    the Appellants was ill.  The Sponsor's evidence was inconsistent as  to
    whether it was one of the Appellants who requested this or  whether  it
    was his wife and on either basis he didn't know specifically  what  was
    needed and had no evidence of receipts or  medical  bills.   Similarly,
    the Respondent was asked about evidence of payment of  education  fees,
    which he stated he didn't have as he had never needed to ask for  proof
    of the same from family members.  The financial support  sent  went  in
    the first instance to the Sponsor's wife, who controlled the money  and
    who then distributed it to the Appellants depending on their need

12. Mr Mohammed Hafeez also provided written and oral evidence on behalf of
    the Appellants.  He is a childhood friend of the Sponsor, having  grown
    up in the  same  village  in  Pakistan  to  him  and  has  visited  the
    Appellants in Pakistan  relatively  recently.   He  confirms  that  the
    Sponsor  provides  for  the  whole  family's   financial   upkeep   and
    maintenance and that they are wholly dependent on him for the same.

13. In closing on behalf of the Respondent, Ms Chuna relied  on  the  Entry
    Clearance Offices decisions, subject to the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor  now  having  been  accepted.   However,  she
    submitted that there remained insufficient evidence  of  dependency  on
    the Sponsor in accordance with the case of Lim, as the limited evidence
    of financial remittances was insufficient.  The Sponsor has  not  shown
    that he had control over the finances of the Appellants as claimed  and
    was unable to give any evidence that the sums remitted  were  based  on
    actual need, with  no  evidence  of  any  greater  or  lesser  need  at
    different times.  No receipts have been provided for payment of  things
    such as education fees or medical  bills.   The  financial  remittances
    themselves have been sporadic and controlled by the Sponsor's wife, not
    the Appellants.  It was  further  submitted  that  even  if  there  was
    financial dependence, it was necessary to also have emotional or  other
    dependence on the Sponsor and there was no evidence of the same in this
    case.

14. Ms Chuna further highlighted that there was a discrepancy  between  the
    evidence of the Sponsor and Mr Hafeez as to why the money  is  sent  to
    the Second Appellant and not to other family members,  given  that  the
    First and Third Appellants were regularly travelling to  the  city  for
    studying and it was entirely unclear why remittances  were  sent  to  a
    third party who was not a family member in 2016.   There  was  also  no
    evidence at all as to how  the  remittances  were  being  used  by  the
    Appellants.  Overall, it was submitted that the Appellants had not,  on
    the balance of probabilities, shown that they  were  dependent  on  the
    Sponsor.

15. In closing on behalf of the  Appellant,  Mr  Ali  reiterated  that  the
    position had to be assessed as at the date of hearing and determination
    of whether the financial remittances were sent by the Sponsor  for  the
    Appellants' essential needs.  It was submitted that they were and  that
    there was a history of regular remittances  from  July  2015  which  in
    total amounted to over �21,000 of documented transfers.  The money  was
    used for the living needs, education and upkeep of the family  and  the
    Sponsor had fully explained why remittances were  made  to  the  Second
    Appellant as the only male family member.



Findings and reasons

 1. As set out above, the only issue in the Appellants' appeals is  whether
    they are dependent on the Sponsor  in  the  United  Kingdom.   For  the
    following reasons I find, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  they
    are.

 2. First, there is documentary  and  witness  evidence  (from  the  Second
    Appellant, the Sponsor and a family friend)  of  financial  remittances
    from the Sponsor to his family in Pakistan (including his wife and  the
    Appellants) dating back to July 2015.  Although  remittances  have  not
    been made on a strictly regular or monthly basis, they have  been  made
    with a degree of frequency and with  largely  consistent  provision  on
    each occasion.  I accept the evidence of the  Sponsor  and  the  Second
    Appellant that in the main, financial remittances have been sent in the
    name of the Second Appellant for cultural and practical  reasons  given
    that he is the only male family member in  Pakistan  and  is  therefore
    given responsibility for collecting these sums from the  city  that  is
    sufficient explanation for the use of one named beneficiary even though
    the First and Third Appellants also study in the city and travel there.
     There was no reasoned suggestion on behalf of the Respondent  that  in
    fact the financial remittances  were  not  shared  between  all  family
    members in Pakistan, including the Appellants, nor that it wasn't  used
    for each of their needs.

 3. I do not find the evidence of financial remittances to be undermined by
    the small number of occasions several years ago  of  remittances  being
    made to a family friend and neighbour, for which the Sponsor has  given
    a practical explanation which is plausible  and  credible  in  all  the
    circumstances.

 4. Secondly, there was further evidence  of  financial  support  from  the
    Sponsor was specifically in relation to his visit in  August  2018,  of
    providing cash personally to the Appellants and  his  wife.   This  was
    supported by  bank  statements  showing  withdrawal  of  the  same  and
    passport entries showing travel.

 5. Thirdly, there is in addition, the  limited  evidence  of  the  Sponsor
    being responsible for the Appellants education fees, albeit without any
    evidence of specific amounts paid or receipts for the  same.   Although
    these appeals have been in process for some time and  the  issues  well
    known to the Appellants, providing opportunity for further  documentary
    evidence to be gathered, I do not find that the absence of such further
    evidence of specific payment of education fees, or of medical  fees  to
    undermine the Appellants' claims nor their credibility or that  of  the
    Sponsor.  It is wholly understandable within a family situation, that a
    parent would not require documentary proof of sums paid  by  the  child
    full  financial  remittances  were  made.   In  any  event,  there   is
    sufficient evidence of financial remittances as above.

 6. Fourthly, there is no evidence that the Appellants,  nor  their  mother
    have ever been in employment, nor that they have  any  other  financial
    resources, income or savings, available to them such  that  they  would
    not require financial support from the  Sponsor.   The  Respondent  has
    made no reasoned suggestion  that  this  is  the  case.   Although  the
    Appellants are now adults and have undertaken training with a  view  to
    seeking employment in  Pakistan,  the  fact  that  they  have  not  yet
    obtained employment, either because of the job market  conditions,  for
    cultural reasons pending marriage or even if purely by choice, that  is
    irrelevant for the purposes of this appeal.  The Tribunal does not need
    to enquire as to the reasons why the Appellants are  dependent  on  the
    Sponsor but only needs to determine that they cannot  in  fact  support
    themselves.  There is nothing before me to suggest that the  Appellants
    are currently in a position to  support  themselves  without  financial
    support from the Sponsor.

 7. Finally, in particular in the absence of any other form of support,  it
    appears to be uncontroversial that the financial remittances  from  the
    Sponsor are for the Appellants' basic and  essential  needs,  including
    accommodation, food, living expenses and up until very  recently,  fees
    for education.

 8. For all of these reasons, I find that the Appellants  have  established
    that they are dependent on the Sponsor and there  is  no  dispute  that
    they are direct descendants of his, nor that the Sponsor is a qualified
    person in the United Kingdom.  As such they satisfy the requirements of
    Regulations 7 and 12 of the  EEA  Regulations  and  their  appeals  are
    therefore allowed.


Notice of Decision

For the reasons given in the annexed decision, the making  of  the  decision
of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of  a  material  error  of
law.  As such it was necessary to set aside the decision.

The decision is remade as follows:

The Appellants appeals are allowed under the Immigration (European  Economic
Area) Regulations 2016.

No anonymity directions are made.

Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr I Ali of Counsel, instructed by M & K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The three appellants in this case appeal with permission  the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson who dismissed their appeals against
    the refusal  of  an  EEA  family  permit  under  Regulation  7  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016.   At  the  same
    time an appeal by their mother was heard which was allowed by the First-
    tier Tribunal and there is no further challenge to  that  part  of  the
    decision.

 2. Essentially the original reasons for refusal were overtaken by the time
    of the appeal, because  in  part  they  were  on  the  basis  that  the
    relationship was not accepted between the appellants and their  father,
    the Sponsor, who is a Spanish national in the United Kingdom, which was
    accepted by the time it  came  to  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Instead the only issue remaining was whether  the  children,
    as adults, were financially dependent on their  father  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  There was no issue as to his status as a qualifying person in
    the United Kingdom.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal's findings in  relation  to  the  children  are
    contained in paragraphs 15 to 21 of the decision.   The  conclusion  is
    that the appellants have not shown that they are genuinely  financially
    dependent on the sponsor  for  their  basic  needs.   The  decision  is
    challenged on five grounds.  First, that the First-tier Tribunal failed
    to consider all of the evidence of financial remittances going back  to
    2015.  Secondly, that the First-tier Tribunal reached conclusions  that
    it was not entitled to in  relation  to  the  money  transfer  receipts
    considered upon which it could not be  assumed  that  not  all  of  the
    amounts were paid.  This was not an issue raised by the respondent, nor
    was the issue raised with the sponsor at the hearing so that  he  could
    respond to it.  Thirdly,  inadequate  credibility  findings  were  made
    against the sponsor.  Fourthly, the First-tier Tribunal findings as  to
    the position of the female appellants as regards to studying  and  paid
    work were reached without any  evidential  basis.   Finally,  that  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal were  inconsistent,  in  particular
    finding that there was some irregular support which did  not  establish
    dependency, but no evidence of any other income.

 4. As to the first and second grounds of appeal.  At paragraph 16 there is
    a list of money transfer receipts that is said was put into evidence by
    the appellants which is taken into account.  Those receipts go from  30
    July 2016 up until 23 February 2018, for roughly consistent amounts  on
    an irregular rather than monthly basis.  There is some criticism of the
    nature of those receipts and concerns  about  the  documents,  some  of
    which showed that cash had actually been paid,  some  showing  that  no
    amounts have been paid and that there  is  a  running  balance  between
    them, such that the Judge concluded on  the  balance  of  probabilities
    that there was insufficient evidence to show that the amounts  referred
    to were actually paid.  There were however  differences  between  those
    documents and that criticism does not apply to  all  of  the  documents
    relied upon.  There is also a point taken by the Judge  that  the  bank
    statements do not necessarily correlate to  the  amounts  withdrawn  in
    cash and transferred.  There is however an accepted  finding  which  is
    repeated later on that money has been sent on an irregular  basis  from
    the sponsor to his family in Pakistan, including  for  the  appellants.
    In relation to the  money  transfer  receipts,  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal there were also a number going back for a period of more  than
    a year before those quoted  in  paragraph  16  of  the  decision,  also
    showing irregular transfers of money.  These go back to  May  2015  but
    are not referred to at all in the decision.  It is on  that  basis  far
    from clear that the First-tier Tribunal has had any regard to  them  or
    taken them into account.

 5. A further finding follows in paragraph 19 from those  in  paragraph  16
    about the evidence of  financial  remittances,  that  the  evidence  of
    financial support which was accepted had only been done shortly  before
    the applications to enter the United Kingdom and  that  the  money  had
    been sent to bolster the applications such that there was  no  evidence
    of genuine dependency.  Of course, the  transfer  receipts  which  date
    back to 2015 significantly predate the current applications for an  EEA
    family permit which were  made  in  May  2017.   There  was  however  a
    previous application for  an  EEA  family  permit  in  2016  which  was
    refused, although that is not expressly the point made  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal in paragraph 19.

 6. The third ground of appeal was that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    law in failing to make any no credibility findings in relation  to  the
    sponsor, although in part this is covered at least by reference to  the
    sponsor's evidence not being accepted  as  being  extremely  vague  and
    inconsistent.  The First-tier  Tribunal  clearly  considered  that  the
    sponsor should have been able to give more detail about a long-standing
    financial support  arrangement.   Unfortunately,  in  no  part  of  the
    decision is the sponsor's evidence set out nor  is  there  any  reasons
    given as to why it was considered vague or inconsistent.   No  examples
    of such vagueness or inconsistency are given and it is entirely unclear
    on what basis those comments are therefore made.

 7. As to the fourth ground of appeal, in paragraph 17 of the decision  the
    First-tier Tribunal, the Judge notes concerns about  documents  from  a
    sewing college and an IT college which are  almost  in  identical  form
    stating that the sponsor was  paying  the  children's  fees  for  their
    education.  A  further  finding  that  it  is  unlikely  that  the  two
    daughters have been studying without any pay as claimed at the ages  of
    26 and 23, is a finding which appears to have no basis on the  evidence
    before the Tribunal and no particular reason why students would be paid
    for their studies, particularly if the culture  in  Pakistan  is  taken
    into account where adult children often remain within  the  family  and
    are supported by them for a longer period and may  not  be  working  in
    such  circumstances.   That  seems  to  be  pure  speculation   without
    foundation within the paragraph.

 8. As to the final ground of appeal, in paragraph 18 of the  decision  the
    Judge also refers again to the repeated finding that  remittances  have
    been made on an irregular basis, and the sponsor's own evidence that he
    has had periods over the years since he left Pakistan of not being able
    to send  anything  to  the  appellants,  with  the  conclusion  reached
    therefore that the appellants must have had  other  means  of  support.
    Again, there is no evidential basis for that, nor any reasons  set  out
    for the inference.  It also  arguably  fails  to  consider  the  period
    immediately before the hearing and the situation as at the date of  the
    hearing where there was evidence of financial support.

 9. For these reasons, I find there are a number of errors and presumptions
    within the decision of the First-tier Tribunal which are not  supported
    by the evidence that was before the Tribunal or is not borne out by any
    background evidence at all.  It is unclear from the reasons  about  the
    sponsor's credibility findings and overall I find  the  combination  of
    the failure to take into account material evidence of financial support
    since 2015, failure to give reasons  why  the  sponsor's  evidence  was
    considered to be  vague and inconsistent and  the  presumptions  around
    pay and work of adult children as well as considering  the  history  of
    the matter to a far greater extent than as at the date of hearing,  are
    in combination material errors of law in the findings  of  fact  as  to
    whether the appellants are dependent upon the  sponsor  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  For these reasons the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in
    respect of those three appellants, not  including  their  mother  whose
    appeal was allowed, must be set aside.

10. The parties before me agree that the Upper Tribunal should retain  this
    case to remake the appeal and that only  limited  further  findings  of
    fact are required.  It was not possible to do this at the hearing on  7
    February 2019 as an interpreter was not available for  the  sponsor  to
    give further evidence.  The case was adjourned, to be  relisted  before
    UTJ Jackson on 25 March 2019.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.



Directions

The appeal is re-listed for further hearing before UTJ Jackson on  25  March
2019 with a time estimate of 1.5 hours.  An Urdu interpreter is required.

The Appellants are to file and  serve  any  further  written  statements  or
evidence upon which they wish to rely no later than 4pm on 11 March 2019.

No anonymity direction is made.
