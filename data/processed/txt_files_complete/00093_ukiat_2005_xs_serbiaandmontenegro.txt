Appearances:
For the Appellant:      Mr Walsh, instructed by the Refugee Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Ms L Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


  1. This is an appeal against the determination of an  Adjudicator,  Mr  M
     Shrimpton, promulgated on 10 October 2003.  In that determination,  he
     dismissed the Appellant's appeal from the refusal of the Secretary  of
     State on 30 May 2003 to grant asylum and his giving removal directions
     for the Appellant's removal  as  an  illegal  entrant  to  Serbia  and
     Montenegro (Kosovo).

  2. The Appellant had claimed to be a citizen  of  Serbia  and  Montenegro
     from Kosovo of Gorani ethnicity from the Dragash municipality  in  the
     south of Kosovo.  He had entered this country on 2 May 2003  concealed
     in a lorry, travelling from Macedonia via Germany.  He had been living
     in Macedonia since leaving Kosovo in 1999.

  3. The Appellant's claim had initially been certified but the certificate
     was withdrawn following  an  application  for  Judicial  Review.   The
     Secretary of State  accepted  on  the  evidence  that  the  previously
     disputed Gorani ethnicity of the Appellant had now  been  established.
     At the outset of the hearing before the Adjudicator,  the  Adjudicator
     sought to establish what the Secretary of  State  was  now  contending
     about nationality, in the light of the comments in the refusal  letter
     about there being no record of anybody of the Appellant's name  having
     been born or having lived in the villages where the Appellant  claimed
     that he had been born and lived.  The Home Office Presenting  Officer,
     according to paragraph 13 of the determination, said in terms that the
     Secretary of State did not accept that the Appellant was from  Kosovo,
     although he now accepted that he was of Gorani ethnicity.  Bearing  in
     mind the limited geographical area in which  Gorani  was  spoken,  the
     Adjudicator concluded that in effect the Secretary of State's case was
     that the Appellant came from Macedonia rather than from Kosovo, or was
     at any rate that the Appellant could not demonstrate to the  necessary
     low standard of proof that he did come from Kosovo.

  4. The Adjudicator then turned to the case in relation to persecution and
     risk of treatment in breach of Article 3. He said in paragraph 19:

           "I am sorry to say, having seen and  heard  the  appellant  give
           evidence today, tested very thoroughly if I may  say  in  cross-
           examination by Mr Flegg that the reasonable degree of likelihood
           or serious possibility standard of proof is nowhere near met."

      The Adjudicator explained why  he  came  to  that  conclusion  in  the
      succeeding paragraphs.

  5. The first point that he made was that the Appellant could not  give  a
     credible account of how he got from Tetovo in  Macedonia  to  Germany,
     nor from Germany to England.  All that he said was that he came  by  a
     lorry from Tetovo concealed in a "box".  The Adjudicator said that the
     Appellant could barely describe the box and was unable to explain  how
     he crossed a minimum of five international frontiers  before  arriving
     in Germany.  The Adjudicator had  asked  the  Appellant  a  number  of
     questions about the route taken and the upshot of the answers was that
     the Appellant did not know, but said that at no frontier was the lorry
     searched nor was he asked for papers.  The Adjudicator did not  accept
     that, finding the whole account implausible.  He said:

           "I do not accept for one moment that the appellant  could  cross
           so many international frontiers without a  single  search  being
           made ....  I accept that one could travel quite easily concealed
           in a lorry between Austria and Germany, but I do not  accept  it
           would be so easy to cross the other international frontiers, not
           least in a part of the world as tense as the Balkans  have  been
           in recent years."



  6. He continued saying that he did not accept  the  account  of  how  the
     Appellant was concealed in the lorry because he could give no credible
     or sensible explanation of how he was concealed or the manner in which
     he was concealed.  The Adjudicator rejected the claim  that  he  could
     travel from Macedonia to Germany and on to the United Kingdom  without
     any form of identity documents.  He thought it overwhelmingly probable
     that the Appellant had had proper national identity documents.

  7. Next the Adjudicator concluded the Appellant had given an inconsistent
     account of his background, had given no credible explanation as to how
     he had come by the not  insubstantial  sum  of  5,000  euros  and  had
     produced no document of identity or other  documents  linking  him  to
     Kosovo.

  8. The Adjudicator then said that he did not accept  that  the  Appellant
     was from Dragash in Kosovo.  The Adjudicator  also  pointed  out  that
     record keeping in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from the  alleged
     birth day in 1984 of the Appellant was not so  incomplete  that  there
     would have been no record had the Appellant  come  from  the  villages
     which he claimed to come  from.   The  Secretary  of  State  had  made
     enquiries in Kosovo.  In the upshot the Adjudicator concluded that the
     Appellant, although a Gorani, was a  citizen  of  Macedonia  from  the
     region of Tetovo or an area close to the Macedonia/Kosovan border.  He
     had earned money there as a labourer or elsewhere in Europe.   He  had
     not left Macedonia as recently as 2002.

  9. The Adjudicator then said that even  if  the  asylum  claim  had  been
     credible there was now a sufficiency of protection for those of Gorani
     ethnicity in Kosovo.

 10. As to the human rights claim which was based on Articles 3 and 8,  and
     the depression from which the Appellant claimed to be  suffering,  the
     Adjudicator rejected the evidence from two psychiatrists to the effect
     that the Appellant was suffering from depression, because he said that
     both the doctors had assumed for the purposes of  their  reports  that
     the Appellant's account of ill-treatment  in  Kosovo  was  true.   The
     Adjudicator said that the account  was  not  true  and  therefore  the
     reports faced the fundamental objection that the Appellant was  not  a
     reliable historian.  There was nothing genuine in the claims to have a
     suicidal ideation or in the threats of suicide which he had made known
     to the doctors, were he  to  be  returned  to  Kosovo.   Both  reports
     suffered from the same defect, that is to say, "the lack  of  adequate
     work on validation [of]  self-reporting  symptoms,  where  the  person
     reporting the symptoms has something to gain".

 11. But in any event, the Adjudicator continued, even if the Appellant was
     suffering from a major depressive disorder and was from Kosovo,  there
     were adequate facilities available there for his treatment.  There was
     no evidence about the  position  in  Macedonia  but  it  was  for  the
     Appellant to show that there were there deficiencies in  treatment  of
     such a nature as to assist the ECHR claim.

 12. The Adjudicator then referred to a further hurdle which he said lay in
     the way of the human rights claim, although he  reached  no  concluded
     view on it: that was the  principle  of  extra  territoriality  as  he
     described it, namely that the ECHR could not impose obligations on the
     United Kingdom in relation to what might happen to an individual  upon
     return to their own country.  Thereafter the Adjudicator  returned  to
     whether there would be anything disproportionate about the  return  of
     the Appellant to Kosovo or Macedonia for the purposes of Article 8(2),
     concluding that it could not begun to be said to  be  disproportionate
     to remove the Appellant.  The human rights aspect was not arguable  he
     said.

 13. The Adjudicator made some further comments about whether a  threat  of
     suicide "where the suicide would be voluntary" could engage the United
     Kingdom's international obligations  in  any  way.   He  expressed  no
     concluded view on the matter, but was clearly  inclined  to  the  view
     that the law could not hold out to non-nationals the prospect of  non-
     removal merely by their threatening  in  the  absence  of  significant
     mental illness to take their own life.

 14. The Adjudicator also commented on some  matters  that  had  transpired
     during the course of the hearing.  We set those out because  they  are
     relevant to submissions which Mr Walsh made to us:

           "I should say for the avoidance of doubt, having referred to  Mr
           Flegg's cross-examination, that  Mr  Walsh,  with  a  degree  of
           impertinence with respect, suggested that I too had conducted  a
           cross-examination.  It is right that I put additional  questions
           to the appellant, but it is trite law in this jurisdiction  that
           an Adjudicator is entitled to put questions of his or her own to
           a witness, including an appellant.  It is almost  by  definition
           additional questions will refer to matters not raised  in  cross
           examination.  There is no rule of law restricting an Adjudicator
           to questions that have  already  been  put,  on  behalf  of  the
           Secretary of State and I did not uphold an objection by Mr Walsh
           to additional questions, for example on the  appellant's  method
           of getting to this country.


           When the appellant was first asked by me how the lorry got  from
           Tetovo to Germany, he was unwise enough (with respect)  to  give
           what he no doubt thought was a clever answer, to the effect that
           it got to Germany because it had an engine.   Unsurprisingly  in
           those circumstances there was  an  element  of  asperity  in  my
           follow-up question, because I had not supposed  for  one  moment
           that the lorry which allegedly took the appellant  all  the  way
           from Tetovo to Germany by a route which  cannot  be  identified,
           across frontier crossing points which cannot be named, was towed
           all the way.  For the avoidance of doubt I do  not  accept  that
           the appellant was concealed  in  a  lorry,  as  I  have  already
           explained, indeed I reject the entirety of his  case,  save  for
           his name."

 15. The grounds of appeal and submissions from Mr Walsh on behalf  of  the
     Appellant claimed that the Adjudicator had acted in a  way  which  was
     procedurally unfair and in a way which would lead an informed and fair-
     minded observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the
     Adjudicator had been biased.  The first factor  was  that  before  the
     appeal had begun at all, the Adjudicator indicated  strong  scepticism
     as to the merits of the case.  Mr  Walsh  said  that  there  might  be
     nothing   wrong   with   scepticism   being   expressed   in   certain
     circumstances, but it was necessary to be particularly careful  where,
     as here, there was to be oral evidence from a witness.   There  was  a
     world of difference between enquiring neutrally about how a particular
     problem was going to be dealt with, such as why there was no record of
     the Appellant's birth in Kosovo and commenting that there was not much
     of a case or why were human rights being raised at all.

 16. The second factor related to the way in which questions had been asked
     by the Adjudicator.  It was not so much that the Adjudicator had asked
     questions, it was rather that he raised them in  a  manner  which  was
     akin to a cross-examination asking leading questions in a hostile  and
     sceptical tone;  they  were  extensive  questions  and  in  part  were
     interposed during the course of cross-examination by the  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer.  They raised issues with  which  the  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer had not been concerned:  in particular  the  manner
     in which the Appellant had travelled  from  Macedonia  to  the  United
     Kingdom, the timing of the making of the  claim  for  asylum  and  the
     record of birth in Kosovo.  Worse, the  answers  in  relation  to  the
     journey had been misrepresented in the determination.  Time and again,
     questions were put about whether the lorry would have been searched at
     a frontier and the answer remained that the  Appellant  did  not  know
     whether there would have been searches  or  what  frontiers  had  been
     crossed, because he was inside something  which  looked  like  a  box,
     which he was unable to describe further.  Thus,  the  essence  of  the
     answers to the repeated questions about those  matters  was  that  the
     Appellant did not know what the position was.  Mr Walsh  had  objected
     to this questioning on the grounds that it was repetitive, hostile and
     had equalled and later exceeded the number of  questions  put  by  the
     Home Office Presenting Officer, by 22 to 15.  The Appellant said  that
     he had attracted the attention of  police  after  embarking  from  the
     lorry in the United Kingdom and not, as the  Adjudicator  asserted  to
     him, that he only claimed asylum when apprehended.

 17. Likewise, the Adjudicator put assertive  questions  to  the  Appellant
     about his national origin;  even the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
     had not done so, whilst taking the stance (tentatively accordingly  to
     Mr Walsh), that the Secretary of State's decision letter left open the
     Appellant's nationality.  It  was  rather  less  firm  a  stance  than
     recorded in paragraph 13 of the Adjudicator's determination.  Mr Walsh
     accepted that, at the outset  of  the  hearing,  the  Adjudicator  had
     raised the question  of  whether  the  Appellant  was  a  Gorani  from
     Macedonia, but it had been put forward more tentatively  by  Mr  Flegg
     than recorded.  It did not follow that the Secretary of State ought to
     have amended the removal directions in order to make out a  contention
     that the Appellant was not from Serbia and Montenegro.  In reality the
     Adjudicator had developed his own theory of the case, both so  far  as
     the journey was concerned and  in  the  analysis  of  the  Appellant's
     nationality.  Further indications of unfairness and an  appearance  of
     bias could be found in  the  fact  that  the  Home  Office  Presenting
     Officer had not been asked to make submissions but  instead,  contrary
     to the normal procedure, the Adjudicator had asked Mr Walsh to sum  up
     his case for the Appellant.  That indicated that the  Adjudicator  had
     made his mind up.

 18. He had also failed to understand and deal with the true import of  the
     psychiatric evidence.  The two reports and in particular the later one
     of Dr Turner, were not simply dependent for their analysis as  to  the
     existence  of  a  major  depressive  order  on  the  accuracy  of  the
     Appellant's story, or upon  what  were  described  as  "self-reported"
     symptoms.  When those reports were properly read, it  was  clear  that
     the causation of the disorder was not key  to  the  diagnosis  of  its
     existence.   The  doctors  and  in  particular  Dr  Turner,  explained
     carefully how they had reached  their  diagnosis.   They  had  made  a
     careful diagnosis and although there was some  self-reporting  of  the
     symptoms, the diagnosis according to the report was   based  upon  the
     independent use of psychiatric experience and expertise applied within
     the relevant DSM and ICD frameworks.  The dismissive way in which  the
     Adjudicator dealt with those reports was not just an error  in  itself
     but also indicated the extent of bias and hostility.  The  Adjudicator
     had also expressed  unnecessary  views  about  the  extra  territorial
     effect of Articles 3 and 8 and  unconventional  views  about  suicide,
     both of which were unfavourable to the Appellant and neither of  which
     were necessary.

 19. Although the Adjudicator, had expressed the  view  that  even  if  the
     Appellant were  who  he  said  he  was,  and  suffered  from  a  major
     depressive disorder, the claim would fail because of the  availability
     of protection and treatment in Kosovo, no reliance could be placed  on
     those views because of the appearance of bias in the other conclusions
     of the Adjudicator.

 20. Mr Walsh relied upon a number of IAT decisions as to how  Adjudicators
     should conduct any questions, most notably that of K  (C�te  d'Ivoire)
     [2004] UKIAT 00061 and WN  (DRC)  [2004]  UKIAT  00213.   We  set  out
     paragraphs 37 and 38 of the latter case:

      "37.  The last sentence of guideline seven can be misleading.   It  is
           designed to prevent cross examination or the appearance of cross
           examination, rather than to prevent a question being asked if it
           was a question which the Home Office  Presenting  Officer  could
           have put if he had been present.  The risk of cross-examining or
           appearing to cross-examine can be avoided by an  Adjudicator  in
           the manner,  style  or  length  of  questions,  which  he  asks.
           Generally, questions other than those designed to  clarify  what
           was said or intended to be said are better left until after  the
           conclusion of evidence where no Home Office  Presenting  Officer
           is  present  and  after  re-examination  where  a  Home   Office
           Presenting Officer is present but see K (C�te  D'Ivoire)  [2004]
           UKIAT 00061.

       38. Questions should not be asked in a hostile  tone.   They  should
           not be leading questions  which  suggest  the  answer  which  is
           desired, nor should they disguise what is the point  of  concern
           so as to appear like to a trap or a closing of  the  net.   They
           should be open ended questions, neutrally phrased.  They can  be
           persisted in, in order to obtain an answer; but they should  not
           be persisted in for longer than is necessary for the Adjudicator
           to be clear that the question was understood,  or  to  establish
           why it was not being answered, or to pursue so far as  necessary
           the detail underlying vague answers.  This will be a matter  for
           the judgment of Adjudicators and it should not usually take more
           than a  few  questions  for  an  Adjudicator  to  establish  the
           position to his own satisfaction.  An advocate should always  be
           given the chance to  ask  questions  arising  out  of  what  the
           Adjudicator has asked, which will enable him to follow up, if he
           wishes,  the  answers  given  thus  far.   The  Adjudicator  can
           properly put, without it becoming a cross-examination, questions
           which trouble him or inferences  from  answers  given  which  he
           might wish to draw adversely to a party.  These questions should
           not be disproportionate in length to the evidence  given  or  to
           the complexity of the  case,  and,  we  repeat,  an  Adjudicator
           should be careful to avoid developing  his  own  theory  of  the
           case."

 21. Following directions given by the Tribunal it was established that  Mr
     Flegg, who  had  appeared  for  the  Secretary  of  State  before  the
     Adjudicator, had no comment to make upon the notes made by Mr Walsh as
     to what had been said and done at the hearing.

 22. The Adjudicator's comments on what had been  said  by  Mr  Walsh  were
     sought.  He said that although he was unable in effect  positively  to
     confirm Mr Walsh's note of what had happened,  he  would  not  dispute
     "that it is a reasonable summary".  However, he said that he  had  not
     indicated strong scepticism at the outset, although it  was  his  view
     that it was not  the  strongest  appeal  and  his  purpose  in  asking
     questions at the outset, as set out paragraph 10 of the determination,
     was to clarify what the issues were as a result of the  withdrawal  of
     the certificate following the judicial review proceedings.  He  denied
     that the questioning had  been  extensive  but  as  the  answers  were
     evasive and unsatisfactory it was possible,  not  that  he  adopted  a
     highly sceptical approach but that that a degree of  scepticism  might
     well have been present along the  lines  of  "are  you  asking  me  to
     believe etc".  It had been unnecessary to  call  on  the  Home  Office
     Presenting  Officer  because  the  case  was  clear.    It   was   the
     Adjudicator's task, he said, to raise the issues which  needed  to  be
     put, in order fairly to determine the issues before  him.   There  had
     been  an  intervention  by  Counsel  and  the  Adjudicator  had  drawn
     attention to that in his determination.   The  Adjudicator's  comments
     also  asserted  the  correctness   of   his   comments   about   extra
     territoriality and  various  other  cases.   He  maintained  that  the
     Secretary of State never accepted that the Appellant came from Kosovo.

 23. Mr Saunders for the Secretary of State said that most of the questions
     were  asked  after  the  Home  Office  Presenting   Officer's   cross-
     examination  had  concluded  and  the  Adjudicator  had   offered   an
     opportunity for re-examination upon the questions which he had  asked.
     It was better for the issues to be raised at the hearing if they  were
     troubling to the Adjudicator.  The answers had been of such a  quality
     that the Adjudicator was entitled to persist in order to eliminate  so
     far as possible the vagueness of the replies.  There had been no  need
     to ask the Home Office Presenting Officer for submissions in  view  of
     the conclusion,  which  it  was  legitimate  by  that  stage  for  the
     Adjudicator to reach, that the case was weak and  unsatisfactory.   It
     was accepted that  there  had  been  no  cross-examination  about  the
     nationality of the Appellant.  Even if there had been an error in  the
     understanding of the medical evidence, at its highest it  showed  only
     that there was a significant or major  depressive  condition  and  the
     Adjudicator  was  entitled  to  point  out  that  treatment  for  that
     condition was available in Kosovo;  and if the Appellant was  properly
     found to be from Macedonia, the Appellant had provided no evidence  in
     relation to the situation in Macedonia.

Conclusions

 24. We first point out that what the Tribunal  said  in  WN  (DRC)  [2004]
     UKIAT 00213 applies here too:  the Surendran guidelines  as  discussed
     and explained in that case are guidelines.  They do  not  cover  every
     situation in which the judgment of an Adjudicator is called for as  to
     how to approach a particular case; fairness and commonsense must guide
     them.  If the guidelines are breached, it does not necessarily  follow
     that the Adjudicator has made an error of law, or  acted  unfairly  or
     even appeared to do so.  They are designed  to  be  guidelines  not  a
     source of hazard for the judiciary.

 25.  The  question  that  underlies  all  cases  in  which,  as  here,  an
     Adjudicator's conduct of the hearing  is  at  issue,  is  whether  the
     hearing was fair, and whether there was a  real  possibility  that  an
     informed observer would think that the judge was biased.

 26. In reaching a view on those issues,  compliance  with  the  guidelines
     will make the task of  someone  alleging  unfairness  very  much  more
     difficult  and  non-compliance  will  assist,  by  contrast,   without
     dictating the result.

 27. All the factors have to be considered in the round, because  some  may
     give a flavour of what happened without themselves being of any  great
     significance.  We emphasise that because, inevitably, in analysing the
     allegations  in  a  case,  they  have  to  be  considered   separately
     initially.

 28. In this case, there is little dispute in fact as to what  happened  at
     the hearing.  Mr Walsh's notes were not disputed  by  Mr  Flegg;   the
     Adjudicator, although differing in emphasis  and  interpretation,  did
     not take significant issue with what was said other than in respect of
     what the Home Office Presenting  Officer  declared  the  Secretary  of
     State's  stance  on  nationality  to  be.   The  determination  itself
     acknowledges that an issue arose over the manner  and  length  of  the
     Adjudicator's questions.

 29. We now turn to the individual allegations.  It is perfectly proper for
     an Adjudicator to ask questions at the outset to  establish  what  the
     parties' positions are on particular  issues  and  to  establish  that
     certain  issues  will  be  addressed,  and  to  have  the  answers  to
     particular points  sketched  in.   Adjudicators  are  expected  to  do
     significant pre-reading and it should assist  the  management  of  the
     hearing.  But where live evidence is to be heard,  it  is  unwise  and
     very likely reasonably to be seen to be unfair for an  Adjudicator  to
     express a sceptical view about the credibility of a case.  That is not
     the same at all as expressing doubts about how a case can succeed even
     if the evidence is accepted.  It  is  possible  that  the  Adjudicator
     overstepped the mark here, but the detail of what was asked, and  how,
     is not sufficiently clear for a concluded view to be reached.

 30. It was perfectly proper for questions to be asked by  the  Adjudicator
     of the Home Office Presenting Officer as  to  what  the  Secretary  of
     State's position on nationality was.  There is  an  issue  as  to  how
     tentatively that position was expressed;  the  Adjudicator  records  a
     firm position, but one which the Home Office Presenting  Officer  does
     not appear to have pursued.  We do not find it necessary  to  reach  a
     concluded view.  The Adjudicator delivered his decision orally at  the
     hearing;  the Home Office Presenting  Officer  did  not  interject  to
     disavow what he was said to have conceded.

 31. It was not illegitimate for the Adjudicator to ask questions about the
     mode of travel and nationality of the  Appellant,  even  though  those
     issues were not pursued by the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer.   An
     Adjudicator is entitled to raise issues which trouble  him.   However,
     where there is a Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,  who  does  cross-
     examine, an Adjudicator should sense warning bells ringing  over  what
     he then does.

 32. The questions should be asked after  cross-examination  has  concluded
     except for clarification.  Otherwise, there is an appearance of a dual
     cross-examination.  It may be otherwise if there  is  no  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer and an issue arises  unexpectedly  in  evidence  in
     chief.  Here some questions were asked by the Adjudicator during cross-
     examination by the Home Office Presenting Officer.

 33. The questions should not be too long.  There is no precise permissible
     ratio, but asking significantly more questions than  the  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer is again  an  indication  of  apparently  excessive
     intervention with the attendant risk of apparent bias.

 34. We accept that the tone of the  questions  was  hostile,  leading  and
     repetitive and contained expressions of disbelief.  Mr Walsh's  notes,
     the Adjudicator's comments and the  determination  support  that.   We
     have no difficulty accepting and regarding as fair a certain  asperity
     following one facetious answer given  to  the  Adjudicator.   But  the
     hostility went beyond that.  The Adjudicator simply  did  not  believe
     the Appellant, and repeated the questions in  a  disbelieving  manner.
     There was no need for that in  order  to  resolve  a  vagueness;   the
     denial of knowledge about  the  frontiers  and  the  "box"  was  self-
     consistent.

 35. We also accept that this was on a peripheral  issue;  the  Adjudicator
     with his approach to nationality, frontiers, mode of travel and source
     of money  and,  seemingly  inaccurately,  as  to  when  the  Appellant
     declared himself to the police, was developing his own theory  of  the
     case.  This was very different from the Secretary of  State's  refusal
     letter or the Home Office Presenting  Officer  questions.   Again,  no
     absolute rule can be laid  down;   an  obvious  issue  may  have  been
     omitted; credibility may  be  at  issue  but  a  facet  not  otherwise
     explicitly identified may call  for  examination.   However,  in  what
     remains an essentially  adversarial  system,  for  an  Adjudicator  to
     develop a hostile theory, in addition  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
     different opposition can create a real possibility of the  Adjudicator
     appearing biased.  Warning bells should be sounding.

 36. We do not consider that there was any unfairness  in  asking  for  the
     Appellant's submissions without asking for the Home Office  Presenting
     Officers.  It is quite possible for a fair provisional  conclusion  to
     have been reached, by the stage of speeches, as to the credibility  of
     a witness.  It is fair for the party against whom that conclusion  has
     been provisionally reached to be asked to deal with  the  issues.   Of
     course, and this case illustrates the point,  that  assumes  that  the
     Adjudicator is dealing with the Home Office Presenting Officer's  case
     rather than his own.  The Appellant's advocate must be in  a  position
     to know what the Home Office  Presenting  Officer's  position  is  and
     importantly also an Adjudicator would benefit from knowing what points
     were still actively  being  pursued  by  the  Home  Office  Presenting
     Officer.  Although we do not see it as a  separate  head  of  apparent
     unfairness, it was unwise for the Adjudicator not to hear even briefly
     or in outline the main  contentions  of  the  Home  Office  Presenting
     Officer.  That might have enabled the Adjudicator to avoid  developing
     his own theory too far.

 37. The Adjudicator's expression of his  individual  views  on  important,
     general issues, adverse to the general position of the  Appellant  was
     unnecessary and may have risked giving a false impression of bias  but
     it is not of itself an important matter.

 38. The treatment of the psychiatric evidence was independently erroneous,
     though it stemmed from the adverse  credibility  conclusions.   It  is
     important to distinguish between the situation where the relevance  of
     the psychiatric, or other medical, evidence is wholly or  in  part  to
     support the truthfulness of the account given  by  the  Claimant,  and
     where  its  relevance  is  that  the  illness  or  condition   exists,
     regardless of its course.  The one report may be relied  on  for  both
     arguments.  There are also cases  and  reports  where  the  diagnostic
     conclusions are wholly dependant upon  the  history  or  the  symptoms
     asserted by the Claimant, whose very truthfulness on those matters  is
     at issue before the Adjudicator but not before the psychiatrist.   The
     Tribunal's comments in HE (DRC) (Credibility and psychiatric  reports)
     [2004] UKIAT 00321 are of general importance.

 39. The psychiatrists here made some criticism of  the  concept  of  self-
     reported symptoms, in responding to  Secretary  of  State  criticisms.
     But the point made by the Secretary of State is clear enough,  and  is
     often obvious in many reports.

 40. Where the Adjudicator erred  in  relation  to  these  reports  and  Dr
     Turner's in particular, is that he failed to realise  that  they  were
     seeking to address those two concerns which commonly arise:  first, to
     what extent was their diagnosis dependant on the  Appellant's  account
     of what had happened, and second, to what  extent  had  they  deployed
     their experience  and  expertise  to  reach  a  conclusion  which  was
     objectively supportable rather than one which simply accepted symptoms
     which could be  described  but  which  could  not  be  verified.   The
     Adjudicator dealt with the issues as  if  Dr  Turner's  report  was  a
     commonplace report which  simply  accepted  the  Claimant's  evidence,
     concluded that what he said happened  had  happened  and  accepted  as
     equally truthful the Appellant's own description of symptoms;   it  is
     that type of report which  is  of  such  limited  value  in  assessing
     credibility or illness.

 41. We are very far from saying that an  Adjudicator  would  be  bound  to
     accept the reports' conclusions however.   He  could  still  say  that
     those issues were not persuasively addressed.  But these were  reports
     of significantly greater authority and care than is  so  often  found.
     They did seek to grapple with those  difficult  issues.   They  should
     have been considered on that basis.  Instead, those  material  factors
     were ignored and they were dealt  with  as  if  the  conclusions  were
     simply  dependant  on  an  unqualified  acceptance  of  whatever   the
     Appellant  told  them,  when  the  psychiatrists  and  Dr  Turner   in
     particular, with reason, were denying that that was so.

 42. We prefer to analyse the error that way.  We do not see this as adding
     grist to the mill of the bias argument.

 43. We  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  viewed  in  the  round  and
     particularly because of the topics and  nature  of  the  Adjudicator's
     questions, that there was a  real  possibility  that  the  Adjudicator
     would have appeared biased to the informed observer.  We do not  doubt
     that the Adjudicator intended to be fair, and  he  is  certainly  open
     about what he is thinking.  But we find  it  difficult  to  avoid  the
     conclusion that even if he had not made up his mind  before  the  case
     began, he would have so appeared to the informed observer.

 44. He has also independently erred in an assessment  of  the  psychiatric
     evidence.

 45. We do not consider it  appropriate  in  those  circumstances,  in  the
     absence of the clearest possible case, for reliance to be placed so as
     to dismiss this appeal on  the  "fall-back"  views  expressed  by  the
     Adjudicator.

 46. This appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted  for  hearing
     other than before Mr Shrimpton.  It will come before  the  AIT,  which
     will decide how it should in fact proceed.

 47. This decision is reported as an illustration  of  what  we  have  said
     about Adjudicators' conduct, and about psychiatric reports.
