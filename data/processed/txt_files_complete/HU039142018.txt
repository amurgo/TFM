Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr R Sharma, Direct Access Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although the Secretary of State is the Appellant I refer to the parties
    as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2.  The Appellant, a citizen  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of  State  to  refuse  his
    application for indefinite leave  to  remain  on  the  ground  of  long
    residence on 19th  January  2018.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Taylor
    allowed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 22nd October 2018.  The
    Secretary of State now appeals to this Tribunal with permission granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Birrell on 20th November 2018.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant came to the  UK  on
    23rd September 2006 with leave to enter as a student which was extended
    until 31st December 2008.  His leave was  subsequently  extended  as  a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant until 21st June 2016.  On 18th June 2016 he
    applied for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1  Migrant  which  was
    varied to an application on the basis of long residency.

 4. The Secretary of State refused that application under paragraph  322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules, which  provides  a  discretionary  Ground  of
    Refusal where -

         "The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in
         the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct   (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C)),  character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security".

    This led to refusal under paragraph 276A (ii) and (iii).

 5. The basis for the refusal was that, in his application for extension of
    his leave to remain in March 2011 and in a further application in  June
    2013, the Appellant had misstated his earnings during the relevant  tax
    years.  The income claimed in the two applications by the Appellant was
    not consistent on each occasion with the tax return  submitted  to  the
    HMRC where the Appellant had declared earnings below those  claimed  in
    his immigration applications.  The Secretary of State  considered  that
    the  Appellant  had  not  submitted  a  credible  explanation  for  the
    discrepancy in the financial information submitted and decided that  it
    was appropriate to refuse the application.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted as a preliminary matter that it was
    accepted by the Presenting Officer that the Appellant's wife and oldest
    child had been granted leave to remain on the basis of Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights on 17th  August  2018.   The  judge
    considered the oral and documentary evidence  and  noted  that  in  the
    reasons for refusal letter there is no suggestion that there have  been
    any gaps in the Appellant's  lawful  leave  in  the  UK  and  that  the
    Respondent had not suggested that the  Appellant  dishonestly  inflated
    his earnings in the UK in order to obtain leave. Accordingly, the judge
    considered that the  sole  allegation  on  which  the  application  was
    refused is that the Appellant submitted a  false  tax  return  for  the
    years 2011 and 2012 in that his self-employment income was understated.



 7. The judge considered the  evidence  at  paragraph  12  noting  that  no
    evidence of dishonesty or deceit had been submitted  to  the  Tribunal.
    The judge also took into account the evidence from the  Appellant  that
    he discovered the error when  he  started  employment  at  Barratts  in
    August 2014 when he checked his first  P60  and  noticed  that  he  was
    paying more tax than when he was self-employed and that he arranged for
    amended returns to be submitted.  The judge considered  it  a  material
    consideration  that,  several  months  prior  to  his  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain, the Appellant submitted amended figures  to
    HMRC, received an amended tax demand  and  agreed  payment  terms.   At
    paragraph 9 the judge noted the  Appellant's  oral  evidence  that  the
    total additional tax for the two relevant tax  years  was  �25,236  and
    that payment terms had been agreed at �200 per month.  The judge found;
    "there can be no suggestion that  the  Appellant  only  agreed  to  pay
    additional tax due to pressure by the Respondent" considering that  the
    chronology suggests that the Appellant voluntarily agreed  for  amended
    returns to be submitted.  The judge noted  that  the  Appellant  stated
    that he relied on his accountant and took into account  the  fact  that
    the accountants had  submitted  an  unchallenged  letter  which  admits
    liability for the error.  The judge found no  supporting  evidence  for
    the allegation that the Appellant had been deceitful or  dishonest,  at
    most in his view the Appellant could be  accused  of  being  less  than
    careful by failing to check the figures given to him by his accountant.
     The judge considered it "most significant" that HMRC did not  consider
    the matter to be one which warranted a  penalty  or  reference  to  the
    police and that HMRC were satisfied to deal with the matter by way of a
    payment schedule, interest and a late payment penalty, and that nothing
    in HMRC's actions suggest that they consider  that  the  Appellant  had
    been dishonest or deceitful as alleged by the Respondent.  At paragraph
    13 the judge noted that the Appellant had not been found guilty of  any
    offence or even reported for consideration for an offence and there  is
    no suggestion that he is a threat  to  national  security.   The  judge
    concluded at paragraph 14 that the Appellant had met  the  requirements
    of paragraph 276B to be granted indefinite leave to remain  in  the  UK
    and, as the Immigration Rules are designed to  be  compliant  with  the
    ECHR, he decided that the appeal should be allowed.

The grounds of appeal

 8. There are three grounds advanced in  the  Grounds  of  Appeal.   It  is
    contended in the first ground that  the  decision  conflicts  with  the
    approach in Abbasi JR/13807/2016 where the Tribunal said  at  paragraph
    73;

         "73. The explanation in such 'self-employed income' cases such that
             the accountant can be blamed has been given short shrift R (on
             the application of Samant) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
             Department  [2017]  UKAIT   JR/6546/2016.    Essentially   the
             applicant must take responsibility for his  own  tax  affairs.
             Not only would the applicant have supplied the figures to  his
             accountant, he would have checked them and would  individually
             have received a tax bill.

         74.  The applicant was responsible for his  own  tax  affairs  and,
             having been self-employed, would have been sent a tax bill for
             which he was personally liable".

    It is therefore contended that the attempt to blame a  third  party  is
    misconceived.

 9. It is contended in the second ground that the  Tribunal  erred  in  its
    consideration of HMRC evidence, finding that the decision of  HMRC  not
    to  pursue  any  further  penalty  against  the  Appellant   is   "most
    significant".  It is  contended  that  this  also  conflicts  with  the
    guidance in Abbasi at paragraph 75 where the  Tribunal  said  that  the
    fact that HMRC had not yet seen  fit  to  issue  a  penalty  notice  is
    neither here nor there as HMRC has  leeway  within  which  to  issue  a
    penalty notice or institute proceedings and that, in  any  event,  what
    the HMRC does or does not do is not necessarily relevant to actions  by
    the Secretary of State in deciding applications for indefinite leave to
    remain.  It is contended that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  this
    case as any decision by HMRC has no relevance to the  indefinite  leave
    to remain claim and so the findings by the Tribunal on this basis  fall
    away.  It is contended that the judge therefore made unsafe findings in
    light of the fact that the HMRC point was at the core of the Tribunal's
    findings.

10. It is contended in the  third  ground  that  the  Tribunal  misdirected
    itself in its approach to paragraph 322(5) of  the  Rules  in  equating
    that paragraph  with  criminal  convictions  and  threats  to  national
    security and in failing to appreciate that tax evasion can also  engage
    paragraph 322(5).

Discussion

11. In granting permission to  appeal  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Birrell
    highlighted the recent case  of  R  (on  the  application  of  Khan)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).

12. At the hearing before Mr Sharma pointed out that the decision  in  Khan
    had been before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.   He  referred  to  the
    skeleton argument which was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  in
    particular paragraphs 47 and 48 which referred to the  decision  of  Mr
    Justice Spencer in the case of Khan (which had not yet  been  reported)
    and set out the guidance given in the case.

13. At the hearing before me Mr Whitwell referred to the guidance given  at
    paragraph 37 of the decision in Khan which is summarised  in  the  head
    note.

14. At paragraph 37 the Tribunal said;

         "In order not to fall into the  trap  which  I  consider  that  the
         Secretary of State (or those acting on her  behalf)  fell  into  on
         this occasion, it may assist  for  me  to  give  some  guidance  in
         relation to the  decision-making  process  where  there  have  been
         discrepancies between previous applications  for  Leave  to  Remain
         (with points claimed on the basis of earnings or profits)  and  tax
         returns which have  been  made  covering  the  same  period.   This
         guidance stems from my observations at paragraphs 32-34 above:


          i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   I  would
             expect the Secretary of State to  draw  that  inference  where
             there is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.


         ii) However, where an Applicant has  presented  evidence  to  show
             that, despite the prima facie inference, he was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary  of  State  is
             presented with a fact-finding task: she  must  decide  whether
             the explanation and evidence is sufficient, in  her  view,  to
             displace the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.


        iii) In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary of  State
             should remind herself that, although the standard of proof  is
             the "balance of probability", a finding that a person has been
             deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with
             the consequence that he is denied settlement in  this  country
             is a very serious finding with serious consequences.


         iv)  However,  for  an  applicant  simply  to  blame  his  or  her
             accountant for an "error" in relation to  the  historical  tax
             return will not be the end of the matter: far from it.   Thus,
             the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account  that,
             even where an accountant has made  an  error,  the  accountant
             will or should have asked the tax payer to  confirm  that  the
             return was accurate and to have signed  the  tax  return,  and
             furthermore the Applicant  will  have  known  of  his  or  her
             earnings and will have  expected  to  pay  tax  thereon.   If,
             realising  this  (or  wilfully  shutting  his  eyes   to   the
             situation),  the  Applicant  has  not  taken  steps  within  a
             reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of
             State may be entitled to conclude either that  the  error  was
             not simply the fault of the accountant or, alternatively,  the
             Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself justifies a
             conclusion that he has been has been  deceitful  or  dishonest
             and therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)
             of the Immigration Rules.


          v) Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to  a
             tax  return  has  been  dishonest  or  merely  careless,   the
             Secretary  of  State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence
             pointing in each direction and, in her decision,  justify  her
             conclusion  by  reference   to   that   evidence.   In   those
             circumstances, as long as the reasoning is  rational  and  the
             evidence has been properly considered,  the  decision  of  the
             Secretary of State cannot be impugned.


         vi) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of  State
             to consider in reaching her decision in these cases, including
             (but these are by no means exclusive):


               1) Whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is
                  plausible;


               2) Whether the documentation which can be  assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;


               3) Why the Applicant did not realise that an error  had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;


               4) Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has  taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay.


        vii) In relation to any of the  above  matters,  the  Secretary  of
             State is likely to want to see evidence which goes beyond mere
             assertion:  for example, in a case such as the  present  where
             the explanation is that the Applicant was  distracted  by  his
             concern for his son's  health,  there  should  be  documentary
             evidence about the matter.  If there is, then the Secretary of
             State would need to weigh up whether  such  concern  genuinely
             excuses or explains the failure to  account  for  tax,  or  at
             least displaces the inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful/dishonest. The Secretary of State, before making her
             decision, should call for the  evidence  which  she  considers
             ought to exist, and may draw an  unfavourable  inference  from
             any failure on the part of the Applicant to produce it.


       viii) In her decision, the Secretary of State should articulate  her
             reasoning, setting out the matters which she  has  taken  into
             account in reaching her decision and stating the  reasons  for
             the decision she has reached."


15. At the hearing before me Mr Whitwell submitted that it was  not  enough
    for the Appellant to simply  blame  his  accountant  for  an  error  in
    relation to an historical tax return.  However, in my view it is  clear
    that the judge did not simply accept an  assertion  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant.  The judge clearly took account of the Appellant's  evidence
    in relation to this.  The judge took into account  that  the  Appellant
    had discovered the error when he  started  employment  in  Barratts  in
    August 2014 [8 and 12] and the Appellant arranged for  amended  returns
    to be submitted and that this occurred several months before he applied
    for indefinite leave to remain.  When the Appellant  submitted  amended
    figures, he received an amended tax demand from HMRC and agreed payment
    terms.  The judge also noted that by the time the  refusal  letter  was
    issued in January 2018 the Appellant was paying the additional  tax  by
    agreed instalments and that this was not connected to the  decision  by
    the Secretary of State.  The judge found that the  chronology  suggests
    that the  Appellant  voluntarily  agreed  for  amended  returns  to  be
    submitted.  The judge also took into account that  the  Appellant  said
    that he relied on his accountants and that his accountants submitted an
    unchallenged letter which admits liability for the error.  Accordingly,
    it is clear to me that the judge  examined  the  circumstances  of  the
    discrepancy between the Appellant's income  declared  in  his  previous
    applications for leave to remain and the income declared to  the  HMRC.
    This is exactly within the guidance set out in the decision of Khan  at
    paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, in particular at paragraph 4 where the  guidance
    states that if realising the accountant's error the applicant  has  not
    taken steps within a reasonable time to remedy the situation this could
    justify a conclusion that the applicant has been  deceitful.   In  this
    case the judge did exactly as set out in the guidance in paragraph 6 in
    the decision of Khan, considering the evidence from the accountant, the
    evidence from the Appellant as to when he realised an  error  had  been
    made and what steps he took to remedy the  situation,  and  when  those
    were taken. Accordingly, I find no error in  the  judge's  approach  to
    this matter and the first ground has not been made out.

16. It is contended in the second  ground  that  the  judge  erred  in  his
    consideration of the evidence about the approach taken  by  HMRC.   The
    judge said at paragraph 12;

         "I find it most significant that HMRC did not consider  the  matter
         to be one which warranted a penalty or  reference  to  the  police.
         HMRC were satisfied to deal with the matter by  way  of  a  payment
         schedule, interest and a late  payment  penalty.   Nothing  in  the
         actions of HMRC suggests that they consider that the Appellant  had
         been dishonest of deceitful, as alleged by the Respondent".

    However, in my view it is clear that  the  judge  considered  that  the
    decision of HMRC not to impose any  penalty  on  the  Appellant  was  a
    significant and relevant factor. I accept Mr Sharma's  submission  that
    the decision by HMRC in these circumstances is  of  some  relevance  as
    HMRC  is  charged  with  countering   tax   evasion   and   has   legal
    responsibilities in relation to this matter. It is clear  from  reading
    this decision that whilst the judge considered that it was  a  relevant
    factor it was not a determinative factor.

17. It is contended in the third ground that the judge misdirected  himself
    in relation to paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.  Mr Sharma accepted  that
    it appeared at paragraph 13 that the judge  concentrated  on  the  fact
    that the Appellant had not been found guilty of any offence or reported
    for consideration for any offence and that there is no suggestion  that
    he is a threat to national security.  However, he pointed to  the  last
    sentence in paragraph  13  where  the  judge  said  "On  the  available
    evidence I cannot be satisfied that the Appellant has been dishonest or
    deceitful as alleged and I cannot be satisfied that he has demonstrated
    that his remaining in the  UK  would  be  undesirable  under  paragraph
    322(5)".  I accept that this is an  implicit  reference  to  the  other
    factors in paragraph 322(5) which refers  to  an  Appellant's  conduct,
    character or associations and not just  to  convictions  or  threat  to
    national security.  In any event, apart from the allegation in relation
    to the tax returns, there  was  no  other  evidence  before  the  judge
    reflecting  negatively  on  the  Appellant's  conduct,   character   or
    associations.  Accordingly, any error in relation to  the  approach  to
    paragraph 322(5) is not material.

18. Looking at the decision as a  whole  I  find  that  the  judge  clearly
    followed the guidance given in the case of Khan.  I find that there  is
    no error in the judge's approach to  the  allegation  of  deception.  I
    accept it is clear  that  the  judge  considered  that  the  Respondent
    discharged the initial evidential burden in relation to the  allegation
    of dishonesty. The judge  obviously  considered  that  the  Appellant's
    innocent explanation was sufficient and it is clear that the judge  did
    not accept that the Secretary of State had discharged any legal  burden
    upon him.

19. In my view the decision is sound and there is no material error.
