Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Timson, counsel, instructed by Whitefield
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant was granted permission to appeal on the grounds
   i) that the First-tier Tribunal judge arguably failed to make findings on
      whether  the  appellant  met  the  financial   requirements   of   the
      Immigration Rules;
  ii) that it was arguable that the judge reached an inconsistent finding in
      that he found that the respondent's decision  was  not  in  accordance
      with the Immigration rules yet dismissed the appeal;
 iii) that it was arguable that the judge gave insufficient  or  no  reasons
      for rejecting the  sponsor's  claim  of  a  genuine  relationship  yet
      finding the sponsor to be 'generally credible';
  iv) it was arguable that the judge gave insufficient consideration to  the
      sponsor's father's evidence.

   2. The appellant and the sponsor married in Pakistan  on  28th  September
      2012. They lived together in Pakistan for a month and the  sponsor  (a
      British citizen) then  returned  to  the  UK.  The  sponsor  has  been
      diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia and  is  on  the  Severe
      Mental Health Illness register. She was  originally  receiving  Severe
      Disability Allowance, then Incapacity Benefit. Those  benefits  ceased
      when she went to Pakistan in 2010. On her return  to  the  UK  her  GP
      practice wrote to confirm that she was 'presently  not  in  employment
      due to ongoing mental health issues'. She produced  evidence  she  was
      receiving Employment Support Allowance.


   3. The appellant applied for entry clearance as a spouse in May 2014. The
      application was refused for the reasons set out in the decision  dated
      9th December 2014 namely

   i) That the ECO was not satisfied that his relationship with the  sponsor
      was genuine and subsisting or that  they  intended  to  live  together
      permanently in the UK;
  ii) That the sponsor was not exempt from  the  financial  requirements  as
      defined.

   4. The grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  specific
      reference to the sponsor being exempt from the financial  requirements
      because her illness meant that  she  met  the  exemption  requirements
      under paragraph E-ECP.3.3. It was argued in the  grounds  that  Severe
      Disablement Allowance - which she had previously been receiving -  had
      been replaced by Employment and Support Allowance  and  she  was  thus
      exempt. The grounds of  appeal  further  relied  upon  Article  8  and
      asserted that in accordance with the IDIs the  couple's  circumstances
      were such as to be exceptional and thus merited the grant of leave  to
      enter outside the Rules. Following receipt of  further  documents  and
      the grounds of  appeal  the  application  was  reviewed  by  an  Entry
      Clearance Manager who concluded that in the  absence  of  any  further
      information in support of the relationship,  the  conclusions  of  the
      Entry Clearance Officer that the couple were  not  in  a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship was sustainable.  The  ECM  also  stated  that
      Employment and Support Allowance is not  on  the  list  of  exemptions
      under Appendix FM and thus the sponsor must show an income of ï¿½18,600.




   5. Mr Timson accepted that if the First-tier Tribunal judge's findings as
      to the genuineness and subsistence of  the  marriage  held,  then  the
      failure to make findings on finance and Article 8 were irrelevant.

   6. The consensus between the parties  was  however  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal judges findings and conclusions on the  evidence  as  to  the
      genuineness and subsistence of the relationship could  not  stand  for
      the reasons contended for in the grounds seeking permission to  appeal
      and the grant of permission.

   7. For those reasons I am satisfied that the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
      erred in law and I set aside the decision to be remade.

     8. In the light  of  the  error  of  law  found,  there  has  been  no
        legitimate hearing of the substance of the appeal  at  all  and  no
        preserved findings of any kind. The scheme of the  Tribunals  Court
        and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the  function  of  primary
        fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. In these circumstances  s.12(2)
        of the TCEA 2007 requires me to remit the case to  the  First  tier
        with directions.

         Conclusions:

         The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve
         the making of an error on a point of law.

         I set aside the decision and remit the hearing  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal for hearing before a First-tier Tribunal judge other  than
         judge B Cox.
