                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                              Anvar Islamkhanov
                                                                  Respondent


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

   1. In a decision issued on 21 October  2015,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Pooler allowed  Mr  Islamkhanov's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
      State's decision of 26 July 2013 refusing leave to enter the UK. On  8
      April 2016 permission was granted to the Secretary of State to  appeal
      the First-tier Tribunal's decision to the Upper Tribunal.  The  appeal
      has not yet been listed for an error of law hearing.


   2. In a letter dated 1 August 2016 Mr  Islamkhanov's  solicitors  advised
      the Secretary of State that Mr Islamkhanov  had  departed  the  United
      Kingdom and requested that the Secretary of State withdraw her  appeal
      before the Upper Tribunal.  The  Secretary  of  State,  in  turn,  has
      requested the Upper Tribunal, in a letter  dated  2  August  2016,  to
      treat the appeal as abandoned by Mr  Islamkhanov  in  accordance  with
      paragraph 17A of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

   3. Whilst it is the Secretary of State's case before the  Upper  Tribunal
      and not Mr Islamkhanov's case, it is  clear  that  Mr  Islamkhanov  no
      longer  wishes  to  pursue  the  appeal  initially  made  against  the
      respondent's decision and accordingly the proper approach is to  treat
      the appeal as abandoned as a matter of fact.

   4. Accordingly, the Upper Tribunal shall treat the matter as at an end.
