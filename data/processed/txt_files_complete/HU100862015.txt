For the Respondent:    No Appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The ECO appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Traynor who in a decision promulgated on 11  March  2017
    allowed the respondent's appeal against the refusal by the ECO to grant
    her entry clearance to the UK as the partner of a  person  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom.  The ECO's decision which  is  dated  21
    December  2015  explained  that  the   respondent's   entry   clearance
    application had been considered in accordance with  the  provisions  of
    the partner Rule as specified in Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules
    as set out in HC 395 (as amended).  The ECO noted particularly that the
    respondent's  application  had  met  the  suitability  and  eligibility
    criteria required for leave to enter, but that  she  had  not  met  the
    financial requirements.   Specifically,  it  was  considered  that  the
    respondent's evidence, and that of her sponsor,  had  not  demonstrated
    that the sponsor earned an annual gross income of at least �18,600  per
    annum and therefore the application stood to be refused upon the  basis
    that the provisions  of  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of  Appendix  FM  with
    reference to paragraph E-ECP 3.1 could not be met.

2.   The respondent had provided documents from her  sponsor's  employer  to
    show that he was employed by McGinley from 5  March  2015.   The  judge
    found that the sponsor did not commence his employment with his current
    employer until March 2015.  Therefore, by the date of application, only
    five months had elapsed and it was therefore incumbent upon the sponsor
    to provide additional evidence of earnings  prior  to  that  time  that
    would show, for the whole of the previous year, that he had  an  income
    which exceeded the �18,600 income threshold.

3.   The judge considered both the letter  from  McGinley  Construction  and
    the subsequent letter that the respondent had  submitted  from  Orbital
    Umbrella Ltd, but neither of them contained this specified information.



4.   The judge held at paragraph 26:

         "It is evident to me, therefore, that  not  only  has  the  sponsor
         failed to provide evidence  of  his  employment  demonstrating  six
         months earnings at  a  gross  annual  salary  of  �18,600  but  the
         document he has supplied with the appeal papers show that  for  the
         tax year 2014/15 his income amounted to only �11,044.  Moreover, he
         has failed to produce the specified documents as  required  by  the
         terms of Appendix FM-SE and, as such, has not demonstrated  at  the
         time of the application that he had  gross  earnings  of  at  least
         �18,600."

5.   The judge also held at paragraph 27:

         "It is further significant that when the application was  made  the
         sponsor was in Uganda.  He was not earning at that  stage  and  the
         evidence  which  he  supplied  in  support   of   the   application
         represented only five months  employment  with  that  employer.   I
         accept his explanation that for the whole  of  the  financial  year
         2015/16, his earnings exceeded �22,500.  That, however, is evidence
         of the appellant seeking to rectify her application after  she  has
         been notified by the respondent that the evidence  upon  which  she
         seeks to rely was insufficient both at the time of the  application
         and the decision in October 2016 and could  not  meet  the  �18,600
         threshold."

6.   The judge concluded at paragraph 28 :

         "When I have considered all of the evidence available to me, I find
         that the appellant has  not  provided  the  documents  required  by
         Appendix FM-SE in order to illustrate  that  her  sponsor's  income
         meets the �18,600 threshold.  In any  event,  such  income  as  the
         sponsor has earned up to the time of the refusal of the application
         did not meet that threshold.  It is  therefore  wholly  justifiable
         that the ECO refused  the  application  upon  the  basis  that  the
         evidence did not meet the requirements of the Rules."

7.   I find that the judge should have stopped  there  because  in  his  own
    analysis of the evidence the respondent could not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

8.   The judge however went on to allow the appeal  under  Article  8.   His
    reasons for doing so were based on his finding  that  family  life  not
    only subsists but Article 8 is  engaged  because  the  refusal  of  the
    application prevents the family from living together  in  the  UK.  The
    judge accepted that the respondent's  decision  was  made  lawfully  in
    accordance with the Immigration  Rules  and  based  upon  the  evidence
    available at the time of the decision.  However, it was apparent to him
    that as these proceedings have been ongoing for some time  and  by  the
    time of the first consideration of this appeal in 2016 when the  papers
    were first placed before a judge of  this  Tribunal,  there  was  ample
    evidence to demonstrate that the  sponsor  was  earning  an  income  in
    excess of �18,600 in the relevant financial year.

9.   The judge said that he was entitled to take into account  as  proof  of
    the fact that the sponsor has been earning the minimum income threshold
    of �18,600 per annum.  He found that the  evidence  was  sufficient  to
    demonstrate  that  the  ECO's  decision  to  refuse   the   applicant's
    application was one which was incompatible with  the  United  Kingdom's
    obligations under Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

10.  I find that the judge's  decision  to  allow  the  respondent's  appeal
    under Article 8 of the ECHR was flawed.  Article 8 cannot be used as  a
    substitute to allow an appeal that has  failed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

11.  The judge  found  that  there  is  family  life  so  under  the  Razgar
    principles we can skip  the  rest  of  the  questions  and  go  to  the
    proportionality assessment.  As the ECO's grounds suggest, the  judge's
    decision does not identify any compelling or exceptional  circumstances
    in this case.  I note that appeals of this nature can be protracted but
    that is not a reason for finding that this appeal ought to  be  allowed
    on Article 8 grounds. Furthermore,  the  relevant  financial  year  was
    2014/15. In the light of his findings at paragraphs 26, 27 and 28,  the
    respondent's sponsor's income did not meet  the  �18,600  threshold  in
    that financial year.

12.  I therefore find that the judge's decision on Article 8  was  wrong  in
    law.

13.  The judge's decision cannot stand.  I  remake  the  decision  and  find
    that there are no exceptional or compelling circumstances in this case.
     Consequently, Miss Giibwa's appeal under Article 8 is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
