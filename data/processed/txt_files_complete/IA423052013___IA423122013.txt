Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms A Ntephe, Counsel instructed by Forward & Yussuf,
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. These are appeals by a citizen of the Netherlands and  her  husband,  a
    citizen of Somalia, against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing their appeal against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to
    refuse them residence cards to show that they are in the United Kingdom
    as an EEA national exercising treaty rights, or the dependent  relative
    of the same, as the case may be.

 2. The second appellant is a national of the  Netherlands.  She  is  self-
    employed in the United  Kingdom  working  regularly  earning  a  modest
    living as a car attendant supervising children taken by taxi to special
    schools.

 3. There is a lot about the evidence which is far from  satisfactory,  for
    example, the application letter refers  to  her  dealing  with  Capital
    Cars, but Capital Cars does not appear in any of the  papers  emanating
    from the appellants  relating  to  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and before me.

 4. It is well known that taxi businesses can appear  and  disappear  quite
    quickly and there is nothing necessarily sinister but it is  an  oddity
    in the evidence which the appellants have made no attempt to resolve.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal was unsatisfied that  the  evidence  before  it
    dismissed the appeals. However, I have to say that it clearly erred.

 6. The difficulty is that the appellants arrived at  the  hearing  with  a
    bundle of documents which are before me.   They  are  not  particularly
    well-presented but they are a paginated bundle  with  an  index  and  a
    contents page.  The copy before me shows that it was actually  sent  by
    facsimile on 26 February for a case to be heard on 27 February.

 7. I will say now, as I have said on many occasions,  and  I  will  go  on
    saying in the vague hope that somebody might eventually listen  to  me,
    that solicitors who for whatever reason cannot comply  with  directions
    about producing documents should not send them by facsimile  after  the
    ordered date and hope that by some magical process they will turn up in
    the right place at the right time. The Tribunal administration  is,  in
    my experience, generally efficient and placing on the  files  documents
    that have been served in  accordance  with  Directions.  There  is  not
    enough staff to reliably file documents that are served  late.  Parties
    should bring such documents to the hearing and  explain  why  they  are
    late.  This means that the judge will know that  the  papers  were  not
    where they ought to be at the  right  time.   He  will  listen  to  the
    explanation and decide what to do with them.  Sending them by facsimile
    creates the false illusion, I do not say cynically,  but  sometimes  it
    has that result, that they were sent in time,  and  more  typically  it
    means they are not  placed  on  the  judge's  bundle  until  after  the
    hearing. Late service of documents  is  a  time-wasting  exercise  that
    causes a great deal of vexation.

 8. There  are  Rules  that  deal  with  the  late  service  of  documents,
    particularly  Rule  51(4)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration   Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005.  This states:

         "Where the Tribunal has given directions setting time limits in the
         filing and serving of written evidence, it must  not  consider  any
         written evidence which is not filed or served  in  accordance  with
         those directions unless satisfied that there are good reasons to do
         so."

 9. It is a fundamental guide in common law that cases are to be  tried  on
    their merits and not on Procedure Rule points.  Of  course,  there  are
    occasions when people so disregard Procedure Rules that the need to get
    on with the case  means  that  making  a  decision  on  an  imperfectly
    prepared case is more important that giving even more time  to  rectify
    deficiencies.

10. The meaning of the rule was tested before  the  Tribunal  in  the  case
    reported as AK (Admission of Evidence - Time limits) Iran [2004]  UKIAT
    00103 where it was pointed out that the reference in the Rules to there
    being "good reasons" means a good reason to admit the documents, not  a
    good reason for being late. I do not think I can avoid concluding  that
    on this occasion the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  misdirected  himself.
    This is  the  only  way  I  can  make  sense  of  paragraph  8  of  the
    determination where the judge said that:

         "Mr Bassi [the Presenting Officer] submitted that good  reason  was
         one thing but just 'difficulties' was different.  I asked Mr Yussuf
         [for the appellants] if he would elaborate on these difficulties if
         he could and he told me he was unable to do so."

11. It is quite clear to me that the judge  was  looking  for  reasons  for
    being late, not looking for reasons that may or may not amount to  good
    reasons for admitting the evidence.

12. Before me  Ms  Ntephe  submitted  that  there  were  good  reasons  for
    admitting the documents.  The fact is they were highly pertinent to the
    case.  They added significantly to the credibility of the claim.

13. I accept, having looked at the  bundle,  that  the  original  documents
    might very well do that.  There is for example what purports to be  the
    badge of the main customer of the  second  appellant,  Access  Mobility
    Transport, on an identity document which on the original  shown  to  me
    does appear to be the person sitting  in  front  of  me,  although  the
    photocopy provided is just a blob of photocopying ink and it could have
    been almost anybody.

14. It is also possible to go through the bank statements provided and  see
    quite regular payments of about ï¿½95  which  matches  with  the  alleged
    payment due for the work done, although the one  document  provided  in
    the nature of a bill cannot  be  traced  in  the  statements  provided.
    There is also clearly reference in the bank statements to a tax  credit
    being paid on a regular basis prompting Ms Ntephe to  ask  rhetorically
    where the tax credits come from if it is not payments made by  a  self-
    employed person.  None of these prove conclusively  that  the  claimant
    was working but they are evidence of considerable assistance and  ought
    to have been looked at by the First-tier Tribunal if  that  could  have
    been done fairly.

15. Although there is, what I am tempted to describe as "faux  outrage"  on
    the part of the Presenting Officer  in  the  First-tier,  there  is  no
    structured argument about what the Secretary of  State  would  actually
    have done with the information if it had been disclosed at  the  proper
    time, or any reason to think that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  been
    unfairly disadvantaged by the late production of the  documents.   That
    the appellants seem to want to rely on photocopies  was  a  matter  for
    comment.  That is something which, given  that  she  has  succeeded  in
    obtaining a further opportunity of having the case heard, she may  very
    well want to address.

16. It seems to me that this is the sort of case where disclosing  original
    documents well in advance of the hearing to let everybody have a proper
    look at them would be a very good idea.  It is my suggestion that  they
    are sent to the Secretary of State and copies to the Tribunal, but I am
    not going to give directions about how the appellant must  prepare  her
    case, that is a matter for her.  My comments will be noted by the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.

17. The appellants have not endeared themselves to anybody by what  appears
    to be casual, late, and rather  reluctant  preparation,  but  they  are
    entitled to a fair hearing and I am quite satisfied that the First-tier
    Tribunal misapplied the appropriate  Procedure  Rule,  and  I  have  no
    alternative in the circumstances but to say the case has  to  be  heard
    again in the First-tier because there  has  not  been  a  proper  first
    hearing.

18. I have decided not to make any directions about the future progress  of
    the case.  That is a matter for the First-tier Tribunal.  I  have  made
    comments about the late production  of  documents  and  indicated  that
    relying on poor copies of the originals would not be a good idea.

19. For all the reasons given, I find the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law
    and the remedy is the case is reheard in the First-tier.
