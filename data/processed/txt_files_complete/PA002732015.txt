                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

On 14 July 2015 the First-tier Tribunal gave  the  Appellant  permission  to
appeal the decision (hereinafter "the Decision") of the First-tier  Tribunal
promulgated on 24 June 2015 dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  a
decision of the Respondent to remove him from the United Kingdom.

The appeal was determined under "The Fast-track Rules" under  Schedule  Rule
1(3) to the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014.

 By a Decision of the President of the First-tier Tribunal, Immigration  and
Asylum Chamber, under rule 32 of the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014, sent  to
the parties on 14  August  2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  set  aside  the
Decision. The Decision was set aside following the decision of the Court  of
Appeal in The Lord Chancellor v Detention Action [2015] EWCA Civ 840.

I saw no useful purpose in the Upper Tribunal making any  reasoned  decision
on the appeal and I was minded to dismiss  the  appeal  without  considering
the merits. The Tribunal sent a Memorandum and Directions to the parties  on
20 August 2015 informing them of my view and inviting representations.

There has been no response to these above Directions.

In the circumstances I dismiss this appeal without considering its merits.

I expect the First-tier Tribunal to re determine the appeal.


|Signed                               |                                     |
|Jonathan Perkins                     |                                     |
|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Dated 1 September 2015               |
