Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Plowright, Counsel instructed by Nasim and Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India, born on  14  August  1975.  On  22
    February 2008 he made an application  for  leave  to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds,  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.   That
    application was dealt with  in  a  decision  dated  15  December  2014,
    whereby it was refused.  The appellant's appeal against  that  decision
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Coll ("the FtJ") on  24  February
    2016.  She dismissed  the  appeal  with  reference  to  the  Article  8
    Immigration Rules.




    The grounds and submissions

 2. In the grounds of appeal against the FtJ's decision,  it  is  contended
    that the FtJ had failed to give any consideration to sections 117A-D of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").

 3. It is also argued that the FtJ had failed to give  "any"  consideration
    to the issue of delay, the appellant having made his application on  22
    February 2008, and in respect of which a decision was  not  made  until
    over six years later.  Reference is made in the grounds to the decision
    in EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL
    41.  It is argued that the FtJ had failed  to  take  into  account  the
    various written statements from friends,  and  from  the  local  temple
    where the appellant volunteers.

 4. In submissions, Mr Plowright focused only on the issue  of  delay,  and
    the question of whether that had been reflected in the FtJ's Article  8
    consideration.  It was accepted before me, as indeed it was before  the
    FtJ, that the appellant was unable to  succeed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, it being accepted in submissions before me  that  the  appellant
    could not establish that there were very significant obstacles  to  his
    integration in terms of paragraph 276ADE of the Rules.

 5. It was submitted however, that the question of delay  was  relevant  to
    the Article 8 assessment.  It was not just  the  appellant's  potential
    situation in India that had to be taken into account but  his  life  in
    the UK.  At [36] the FtJ had said  that  there  was  no  evidence  from
    friends from work and from the temple to suggest  that  his  ties  have
    become  considerably  stronger  during  the  delay.   However,  it  can
    reasonably be inferred that those  ties  were  going  to  get  stronger
    during that period.

 6. As I understood Mr Plowright's submissions, he contended that the delay
    in this case was relevant in the third of  the  ways  described  in  EB
    (Kosovo), namely in reducing the weight otherwise to be accorded to the
    requirements of firm and fair immigration control.  In this case, there
    were compelling circumstances to consider Article 8 outside  the  Rules
    it was said.

 7. The appellant had been in the UK for almost 19ï¿½ years at  the  date  of
    the decision.  Although his exact date of entry was not clear,  it  was
    in November  1996.  Whilst  the  appellant  is  not  dependent  on  the
    relationships that he has made in the UK, they would have got  stronger
    during the period of the delay.

 8. If the decision was to be set aside, the  fact  that  no  'suitability'
    issues arise is a relevant factor, as is the length of time that he had
    been in the UK.  It was not suggested that this case was  a  near  miss
    but it was argued that as of today's date he had been in the UK for  20
    years.

 9. Mr Tufan referred to the decision in Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and the need for compelling
    circumstances outside the Rules to be established.  In the  appellant's
    favour is the length of time that he has been in the UK, but  otherwise
    there was nothing else in his favour.  He has no family life in the UK.
     There was no evidence of the quality of his private  life  apart  from
    the letters that had been provided.  He does not come within  paragraph
    276ADE of the Rules.

10. Even if it was concluded that there should have  been  a  free-standing
    proportionality assessment,  the  decision  in  EB  (Kosovo)  does  not
    indicate that there should be a  decision  his  favour.   There  is  no
    question of the delay showing a dysfunctional system as described in EB
    (Kosovo).  The appellant  had  made  an  asylum  claim  that  had  been
    rejected and he became appeal rights exhausted.   He  was  expected  to
    leave the UK.  The respondent's decision refers to the issue of  delay.
    The appellant had not been in contact with the respondent  for  several
    years.

11. In reply, Mr Plowright submitted that it was  not  correct  to  contend
    that  there  had  been  no  contact  between  the  appellant  and   the
    respondent.  The failure to report referred to in the  decision  letter
    on page 4 refers to there having been  contact  in  2010,  albeit  that
    there does not appear to have been much contact between  the  appellant
    and the respondent in the  years  2006-2010.   There  was  evidence  of
    contact in 2008 because that was when he made the application which was
    the subject of the appeal.  The appellant was entitled to  expect  that
    the decision on his application would  have  been  made  in  a  shorter
    period of time than in fact it was.

    The First-tier Judge's conclusions

12. The FtJ referred to the evidence as being that the  appellant  came  to
    the UK in 1996 and made a claim for asylum on  23  November  1996.   An
    appeal against that refusal was dismissed on  21  July  1997  with  his
    appeal rights being exhausted on 7 August 1997.  She  referred  to  the
    appellant having made the application which is subject to  the  appeal,
    on 22 February  2008.   She  referred  to  reminder  letters  from  his
    solicitors, but notwithstanding those letters, the application was  not
    considered until 15 December 2014.

13. She referred to the decision letter  and  the  respondent's  acceptance
    that  in  the  context  of  paragraph  276ADE  the  appellant  met  the
    suitability criteria of the Rules.  However, it was not  accepted  that
    there would be very  significant  obstacles  to  his  integration  into
    India.  She referred to the  appellant  having  his  father  living  in
    India, but that the appellant had been a disappointment to him, failing
    to  earn  sufficient  money  and  because  he  remained  single.    The
    appellant's evidence was that he agreed with  his  father's  assessment
    and felt worthless.  He had not spoken to his father for many years.

14. In India the appellant also had a younger brother and two sisters,  who
    are married with their own families.  He had spoken to his brother once
    in the previous year.  He has read  about  his  siblings'  families  on
    Facebook.  Another brother moved to  the  USA  ten  years  ago  and  is
    married with four children.

15. The appellant's evidence, again as summarised  by  the  FtJ,  was  that
    because of the delay in deciding the application for leave  to  remain,
    the appellant had not been able to return to India because  that  would
    have jeopardised his application.  For that reason, he was not able  to
    visit his mother when she became ill or when she was dying.  His father
    did not understand the reason why he could not  return  and  will  have
    nothing to do with him for failing to support his mother  in  her  last
    months.  The appellant was especially close to his  mother  and  he  is
    deeply troubled by his failure to support her, and by guilt.

16. The appellant has also been unable to marry because of his  immigration
    status, which has deterred all families from agreeing to a match.

17. The FtJ referred to the appellant living in a rented room on  his  own,
    and that he has two cousins in the UK whom he has not seen for five  or
    six years.  She referred to the appellant's private life, consisting of
    many friends in the UK whom he met at the  Sikh  temple  and  at  work,
    extensive volunteering involvement with the temple and a good  job  and
    relationship with his employer.  She referred to other employments that
    the appellant has had.

18. Referring again to the  appellant's  involvement  in  the  temple,  she
    referred to his worship there morning and evening and his volunteering.
      That  includes  helping  the  elderly  members  at  the  temple   and
    undertaking maintenance work.  She said that unfortunately there was no
    evidence in the bundle and no witnesses from the  temple  to  establish
    whether or not his role in the kitchen there is vital to the production
    of meals for all the worshippers.  She  said  that  the  appellant  was
    "most understated" and modest about his contribution to the temple.  He
    did not claim that the kitchen would be unable to function without him.

19. She referred to the appellant's work before he came to the UK,  in  his
    father's shoe shop, which no longer exists.

20. She noted that there was no significant challenge  to  the  appellant's
    evidence, save that it was contended that his father and siblings would
    not ignore him on his return, and  he  would  not  therefore  be  alone
    there.

21. She concluded  that  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  was  internally
    consistent and supported by some documentary evidence.  She  said  that
    he appeared to be a witness of truth, noting that he spent most of  the
    hearing crying, and whenever asked about his  mother  he  sobbed.   She
    felt that the  appellant  was  genuinely  distressed  at  his  mother's
    illness and death, and missed her greatly.  She also accepted that  the
    appellant was extremely upset  at  the  emotional  distance  which  had
    developed between him and his father and siblings.

22. She concluded that the appellant  would  suffer  some  difficulty  with
    reintegration, in that he would initially be isolated and  alone.   She
    referred to his age and the length of time that he had spent  in  India
    before coming to the UK.  She found that he does  have  little  contact
    with his family in India and that they have shown no interest in him or
    his  welfare.   She  concluded  that  he  would  have   no   offer   of
    accommodation and no family support emotionally  or  financially.   She
    said that "In short, he would be alone and need to make new friends and
    contacts and to find accommodation himself".

23. She accepted that the appellant has many good friends in  the  UK,  but
    she found that he could stay in touch with them by various  means.   He
    had not produced any evidence to show why this would not be feasible.

24.  She  referred  to  factors  that  would  assist   the   appellant   in
    reintegration in India, including the formative years that he had spent
    there, and his fluency in the language.  His record  of  employment  in
    the UK and experience in a range of jobs would assist  him.   She  also
    found  that  his  brother  may  offer  him  work,  that  brother  being
    uninterested but not hostile.  It was also concluded that he could join
    a Sikh temple and volunteer again, thereby  re-establishing  a  private
    life.  He is likely to be considered  an  asset  at  a  temple,  having
    volunteered for many years at the temple in the UK.

25. She concluded that there would not be very significant obstacles to his
    integration into India.

26. Under a sub-heading entitled  'Private  Life  outside  the  Rules'  she
    referred to various authorities.  She concluded that there  is  no  gap
    between Article 8 proper and paragraph 276ADE in this case.   In  other
    words, she concluded that paragraph 276ADE "addresses all the  relevant
    factors in the Appellant's situation".

27. She referred to the decision in EB (Kosovo) at [35] and what  was  said
    in that decision about the relevance of delay.  At  [36]  she  said  as
    follows:

         "I find that the delay of 6ï¿½ years  is  capable  of  being  legally
         relevant to an Article 8 claim  but  not  in  the  context  of  the
         Appellant's case; there is no evidence before me from friends  from
         work and the temple and from the temple authorities to suggest that
         ties had become considerably stronger during the  delay.   Nor  did
         the appellant say this.  In one respect the delay has benefited the
         Appellant in that he has  become  a  more  skilled  worker  as  [a]
         qualified roofer.  Taking account of all the effects of the  delay,
         which  in  turn  have  increased  the  length  of  the  Appellant's
         continuous residence in the UK, I confirm my view that Rule  276ADE
         addresses  the  Appellant's  situation  and  that   there   is   no
         justification for looking at the claim outside the Rules."

    My conclusions

28. The point raised in the grounds in relation to section  117A-D  of  the
    2002 Act was not pursued on behalf  of  the  appellant  in  submissions
    before me.  In the first place, the FtJ did  not  consider  the  appeal
    under Article 8 proper and therefore section 117  had  no  application.
    In any event, it is now well established that an appellant is not  able
    to claim any positive benefit from any of the considerations set out at
    section 117B (see AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC)).

29. The only argument advanced before me was in relation to  the  issue  of
    delay.  It was conceded before me, and was found by the FtJ,  that  the
    appellant  was  not  able  to  establish  that  there  would  be   very
    significant obstacles to his integration into India.

30. So far as delay is concerned, the argument is, in effect, that the  FtJ
    should have gone on to consider Article 8 proper, on the basis that the
    delay  point  established  compelling  circumstances  which  were   not
    recognised under the Rules.

31. It is however, not the case, as is asserted at [6] of the grounds, that
    the FtJ had "failed to give any consideration to the issue [of] delay".
     That is manifestly not the case, as my summary and quotations from the
    FtJ's decision indicate.

32. The FtJ plainly  was  aware  of  the  possibility  that  there  may  be
    circumstances  outwith  the  Rules  which  warranted  consideration  of
    Article 8 proper.  She referred to the decision  in  SS  (Congo).   She
    referred  to  the  need  for  there  to  be  compelling   reasons   not
    sufficiently covered under the Rules.  It is  evident  that  she  fully
    appreciated the  import  of  the  decision  in  EB  (Kosovo),  and  the
    potential impact of delay in an Article 8 case.  Indeed,  at  [36]  she
    said that the delay of six and  a  half  years  was  capable  of  being
    relevant in an Article 8 claim, but concluded that it was not so in the
    context of this appellant's case.

33. The FtJ said at [36] that there was no evidence before her from friends
    and so forth to the  effect  that  the  appellant's  ties  have  become
    considerably stronger during the period  of  the  delay.   I  have  for
    myself considered the letters that the appellant relied on  in  support
    of the appeal.  The FtJ was in fact correct to say that  that  evidence
    did not in itself  at  least,  establish  that  his  ties  have  become
    stronger during the period of delay.

34. Nevertheless, it does seem to me that there is merit in the  submission
    made on behalf of the appellant by Mr Plowright to the effect that  one
    can readily assume that private life ties would  have  become  stronger
    during the six and a half years  it  took  the  respondent  to  make  a
    decision  on  the  appellant's  application.   To  that  extent,  I  am
    satisfied that the FtJ was wrong.

35. However, the fact is that the evidence before her did not  provide  any
    specifics in terms of how, or to what extent, the  appellant's  private
    life ties in the UK had become more deeply entrenched during the period
    of the delay.  There was no evidence from the appellant on that  point,
    as the FtJ pointed out at [36], and the letters of support were equally
    silent on the issue.  In addition, the FtJ did in fact say at [36] that
    the delay had  increased  the  length  of  the  appellant's  continuous
    residence in the UK, a factor which she took  into  account.   However,
    she took the view  that  paragraph  276ADE  addressed  the  appellant's
    situation.  It is clear that she was alive to the possibility that  the
    Rules may not provide complete coverage of the  appellant's  Article  8
    claim in the light of the delay point.

36. The argument on behalf of the appellant, in  fact,  when  analysed,  in
    reality only amounts to a complaint about the delay on its  own  terms.
    True it is that the appellant's private life will have, to some extent,
    become more deeply entrenched because  of  the  period  of  the  delay.
    However, the  evidence  did  not,  and  does  not,  extend  beyond  the
    generality of the reasonable assumption that that was  the  case.   Had
    there been material before the FtJ from which she could have  concluded
    that it has had some real significance in the appellant's case,  beyond
    the general proposition that his private life  ties  had  strengthened,
    she  would  have  been  required  to  undertake  a  further  Article  8
    assessment; no doubt.  That was not the situation that was  before  her
    on the evidence.

37. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any error of law
    in the FtJ's decision.  My comment about the FtJ having been wrong  not
    to refer explicitly to the likelihood of the appellant's  private  life
    ties having strengthened during the period of the delay does  not  mean
    that I am satisfied that she erred in law.  Even if there is  an  error
    of law in that respect, it is not an error of law which is material  to
    the outcome of the appeal.  It is not one that requires the decision to
    be set aside.

38. The FtJ resolved a number of matters in the appellant's favour,  as  is
    clear from my summary of her  decision.   She  took  into  account  the
    length of time that he had been in the UK.  Having concluded  that  the
    appellant's case was covered by the Article 8 Rules, she did  not  need
    to go on to consider the  precariousness  of  the  appellant's  private
    life, or the fact that he became appeal rights exhausted as long ago as
    1997, when he should have left the UK.  Had she  needed  to  go  on  to
    consider those matters, it is doubtful that the  appellant  could  have
    succeeded under Article 8 proper in any event.  Nevertheless,  for  the
    reasons I have given, those were not considerations that the FtJ needed
    to assess.

    Decision

39. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.   Its  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    therefore stands.
