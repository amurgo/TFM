                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The Secretary of State for the Home Department appeals with  permission
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (FtT)  (Judge  N  M  K
    Lawrence) promulgated on 27th April 2015  allowing  the  appeal  of  Mr
    Sargsyan, a national of Armenia, (hereafter "the  claimant")  on  human
    rights grounds contrary to Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.

2.    At the hearing the Secretary of State's representative, Mr  I  Jarvis,
    made a request to withdraw the appeal.

3.    Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the claimant was the  successful  party  before  the
    FtT, we give such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

4.    Accordingly with our consent,  and  pursuant  to  rule  17(5)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, this appeal is recorded
    as "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This is a Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the  parties  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's case is withdrawn.

5.    The effect of the withdrawal is that the proceedings before the  Upper
    Tribunal are at an end. There is no appeal before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    and the FtT's decision shall stand.



Signed      Date: 12th August 2015
