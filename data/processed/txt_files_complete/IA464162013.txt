Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Talacchi (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant's appeal against  a  decision  to  remove  him  from  the
    United Kingdom was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Hussain  ("the
    judge") in a determination  promulgated  on  19th  August  2014.   That
    decision was set aside as containing a material  error  of  law,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 30th March 2015.  Findings of fact made by  the
    judge were preserved.  These included  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant and his wife have enjoyed family life  together  since  2004,
    that the appellant supports her in  practical  terms  on  a  day-to-day
    basis, that the appellant's wife has lived in this country since  1979,
    when she arrived as one of the Vietnamese "boat  people"  aged  16  and
    that she returned to Vietnam  five  years  ago  to  visit  her  elderly
    mother.  The judge also found that the appellant's step-daughters  were
    born in the United Kingdom and that they and their mother  are  British
    citizens.

2.   The appellant's case is that  he  can  succeed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules ("the rules"), in the light of the family life he has established
    here.  In particular, he  claims  that  he  falls  within  EX.1.(b)  of
    Appendix FM,  as  he  and  his  wife  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship and there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing  outside  the   United   Kingdom.    EX.2.   provides   that
    "insurmountable obstacles" means  "the  very  significant  difficulties
    which will be faced by the applicant or  their  partner  in  continuing
    their family life together outside  the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
    overcome or would entail very serious hardship  for  the  applicant  or
    their partner". The appellant  relies  on  cumulative  factors  showing
    insurmountable obstacles, including the difficulties  in  reintegrating
    in Vietnam, the very limited ties to Vietnam that  remain,  his  wife's
    physical problems and lack of mobility and her mental  ill-health,  the
    substantial ties established in the United Kingdom by the appellant and
    his wife and their children.

3.   Mr Talacchi said that the evidence contained in the bundle  before  the
    judge was relied upon in the re-making of the decision.   In  addition,
    guidance from the Home Office, handed up, was helpful  in  relation  to
    insurmountable obstacles.  The guidance  at  paragraph  2  on  page  24
    referred to very significant difficulties leading to  serious  hardship
    for one or both of a claimant and his or her  partner.   The  case  was
    advanced on the basis that insurmountable obstacles to relocation could
    be shown, so that the appellant succeeded  under  the  rules.   If  the
    Upper Tribunal were to  find  no  insurmountable  obstacles,  he  would
    invite a finding that there were exceptional circumstances and that  an
    Article 8 assessment outside the rules would  lead  to  the  conclusion
    that the removal decision amounted to a  disproportionate  interference
    with the appellant's family and private life here.   The  Secretary  of
    State recorded the appellant's claimed arrival in the United Kingdom in
    2003 and his application for leave  in  March  2012,  in  the  decision
    letter dated 25th October 2013.  She acknowledged  that  the  appellant
    met the relationship requirement of the partner route  but  found  that
    there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles   preventing   family   life
    continuing outside the United Kingdom.  Again, the Secretary  of  State
    accepted that the appellant's wife is British  and  has  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom for most of her life but concluded  that  this  did  not
    mean that she and the appellant would be unable  to  live  together  in
    Vietnam, although a degree of hardship might be caused.

4.   The appellant was called  and  adopted  his  witness  statement,  which
    appeared at page 35 of the appellant's bundle.  In that  statement,  he
    described the years 2005 to 2011 as very difficult as his wife suffered
    from depression, had physical problems with her mobility and hips.   He
    helped his wife with most of the household chores  and,  when  her  hip
    problems  recurred,  helped  her  with  dressing.   He  described   his
    relationship with his step-daughters Sonia and Stacey as  very  strong.
    He and his wife have been married for over ten years.

5.   Mr Talacchi asked whether he had relatives in Vietnam.   The  appellant
    replied that his mother and younger sister remain there but they  would
    be unable to help him re-establish himself.  His mother was old and now
    a pensioner and his younger sister had her own family and children.  He
    had nowhere to live in Vietnam and would not be able to  find  anything
    to do there.  He has no savings and would be homeless in Vietnam.

6.   In cross-examination, he said that his mother lives in Saigon with  his
    sister and his sister's children.  Mr Whitwell asked whether his mother
    might help with accommodation, if the appellant returned to Vietnam for
    a short period of time.  He replied that their house was like a box and
    was very small and there was nowhere for him to live there.  There  was
    not enough space.  It was not really a house and was more like a  metal
    box.  His mother, sister and the three children cooked, ate, slept  and
    lived there.  His wife had not seen the property and did not visit when
    she was in Vietnam seeing her mother.  Before he  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom, the appellant sold things on the street such as  biscuits  and
    peanuts to people going to the cinema.  He would be unable to get  work
    as he left a long time ago.  He could speak a little English.

7.   The appellant said that his  wife  would  be  unable  to  join  him  in
    Vietnam because her children lived here.  She had to go to hospital for
    checkups because of her health conditions.  They  had  never  discussed
    the prospect of return to Vietnam.  There  would  be  nowhere  to  stay
    there, no work and so his family life would not be the  same,  even  if
    his wife were to return to Vietnam with hm.

8.   There was no re-examination.

9.   The appellant's wife Jade  Cheung,  gave  evidence.   She  adopted  the
    witness statement which appeared in the appellant's bundle at page 174.
     Ms Cheung arrived in the United Kingdom as a refugee, one of the  boat
    people, in 1979 and naturalised as a British citizen in July 1991.  Her
    relationship with the appellant began  in  2004  and  they  married  in
    August that year.

10.  Ms Cheung said that her mother remains in Vietnam.  She is now  80  and
    lives with her grandchildren in a small space, about 4  metres  square,
    in Hanoi.  If she returned to Vietnam, she would have nowhere  to  live
    and there was no room at her mother's place, which only had space for a
    double bed.  There were six or seven people living there.

11.  Ms Cheung said that she had now lived in  the  United  Kingdom  for  36
    years and was a British citizen.  Her children and  whole  family  were
    here and apart from her mother, she knew nobody in Vietnam.  She is  in
    receipt  of  Employment  Support  Allowance  ("ESA")  because  of   her
    disability.  She is unable to work.  When she was married to her  first
    husband, he looked after her but following their divorce and after  the
    birth of her children, she had no choice but to claim benefits  as  she
    was unable to take employment.  She would have  no  money  in  Vietnam.
    One of her daughters married last year and she  expected  grandchildren
    soon.  She lived here with her husband and there was nothing  for  them
    in Vietnam.

12.  The appellant helps her on a day-to-day basis.  She has to  take  anti-
    depressant medicines and  painkillers  and  sometimes  sleeping  pills.
    Without her husband, she could not cope and if  she  needed  to  travel
    anywhere, her husband had to be there to help her.

13.  In cross-examination, Ms Cheung said  that  she  receives  council  tax
    benefit but has to contribute �37 per month.  Her rent is �131  a  week
    but she did not have to pay this.  She pays the �37 towards council tax
    out of her income support.  If the appeal were  lost  and  her  husband
    went to Vietnam, she wondered how  she  could  live  by  herself.   Her
    family was here.  If her husband were  removed,  this  would  make  her
    mental ill-health more serious and she would not be able to cope.   Her
    children no longer lived with her.   She  was  unable  to  support  her
    mother in Vietnam.

14.  So far as her health is concerned  Ms  Cheung  said  that  the  medical
    evidence appeared in the bundle and that since her last  hip  operation
    seven years ago, she has suffered limited mobility and pain as she  has
    a crack in her femur.  She has been offered another operation and a new
    hip but success is not guaranteed.  She has pain every day  because  of
    the cracked bone.  Mr Whitwell asked about possible return to work,  in
    the light of the prognosis which appeared at page 201  of  the  bundle,
    suggesting that a return was unlikely for at least  two  years  at  the
    time the report was prepared in May 2012.  Ms Cheung replied  that  she
    still could not go to work.  Although she speaks  English,  she  cannot
    write it well.  Without qualifications and with  her  disability,  work
    could be difficult for her.  She still  receives  disability  benefits.
    Her children can help sometimes  and  graduated  here.   Her  daughters
    support Ms Cheung and the appellant financially.

15.  There was no re-examination.

16.  Ms Sonia Pham then gave evidence and  adopted  her  witness  statement.
    Since it was written in February 2014, she has married.   In  paragraph
    3, she referred to her mother's mental health and the  positive  impact
    of the relationship between her parents.  Since the proceedings  began,
    both had been under pressure.  Her mother had a history  of  ill-health
    but the symptoms were alleviated by her  father's  presence  and  help.
    She and her mother worried  about  the  impact  of  separation  if  her
    parents returned to Vietnam.  Ms Sonia said that  she  accompanied  her
    mother to visit her grandmother a few years ago.  Her grandmother lives
    in a shack in Hanoi, made of concrete with no water and no proper roof.
     She is in a small, damp room about one metre square and the rain comes
    in.  It is not a fit place to live.

17.  In cross-examination, Ms Sonia said that she is  able  to  support  her
    mother and tries to visit every few weeks.  She and her husband live in
    London and her mother is in Chertsey.  She relies on her father to pick
    them up when they  visit.   She  has  no  real  relationship  with  her
    grandmother.  Ms Sonia was born in the United  Kingdom.   She  was  not
    aware of any real financial support given to her grandmother.

18.  Ms Stacey Pham gave evidence and adopted her  witness  statement.   She
    said that she can see that her mother's depression  has  become  worse.
    She seemed to be facing a horrible choice between staying  here,  where
    her daughters were, and  moving  away  and  leaving  them.   In  cross-
    examination, Ms Stacey said that she has moved to Peckham since  making
    her  witness  statement.   She  was  aware  of  her  father's  lack  of
    immigration status but this did not prevent bonds forming.  Her parents
    were working things through.  They encouraged Ms Stacey and her  sister
    to develop their careers.

19.  In submissions, Mr Whitwell said that  reliance  was  placed  upon  the
    notice of decision and the letter giving reasons.  Certain findings  of
    fact made by the judge were preserved.  The appellant had withdrawn  an
    application for leave at an earlier stage and this informed  the  basis
    on which family life was developed.  Although it was  correct  that  he
    had been lawfully here with a residence card as a family member, it was
    not clear when the relationship which gave rise to that grant of  leave
    ceased to subsist.  Family life with his wife and  daughters  developed
    at a time when his immigration status was not settled and was, instead,
    precarious.  The Secretary of State's view was that EX.1 did not  apply
    as there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in
    Vietnam.  The Home Office guidance was of assistance  here.   EX.2  was
    introduced on 28th July 2014 and was not in effect when  the  appellant
    made his application or when the adverse decision was made but  it  was
    still relevant and fell to  be  applied.   The  critical  question  was
    whether very serious hardship would be caused to one or  other  of  the
    couple.  On the  evidence,  both  the  appellant  and  his  wife  spoke
    Vietnamese and there  were  no  cultural  barriers  to  integration  on
    return.  Ms Cheung was born and brought up in Vietnam for sixteen years
    and there were some evidence of extended family members  present  there
    on each side.  The appellant had his mother and sister in  Vietnam  and
    Ms Cheung's mother live there.  The children were now in their late 20s
    and led independent lives.  A relevant factor was the medical  position
    regarding Ms Cheung.  The GP's letter written  on  14th  February  2014
    suggested that she was not receiving ongoing treatment for her  hip  or
    in relation to her mobility, although she suffered  pain.   The  report
    appeared to show that Ms Cheung could not walk long distances, although
    she clearly was able to walk to an extent and there was no  expectation
    that she would never be able to  return  to  the  labour  market.   The
    medical evidence had to be seen in that context.  Overall, the Tribunal
    should conclude that there were no insurmountable obstacles  to  family
    life continuing abroad.

20.  If an Article 8 assessment were made outside the rules,  the  appellant
    could not meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE  as  he  had  been
    present here for only twelve years.  It would not  be  disproportionate
    to require him to leave the United Kingdom and, if he wished,  make  an
    entry clearance application from Vietnam.  So far as section 117A to  D
    of the 2002 Act  was  concerned,  the  appellant  was  not  financially
    independent and his relationship with Ms Cheung  developed  at  a  time
    when his status was precarious.  There was no  evidence  regarding  his
    residence card or the circumstances in which his relationship  with  an
    EEA national spouse came to an end and so it was difficult to establish
    whether the relationship with Ms Cheung was formed at a  time  when  he
    was present here unlawfully.  It was  also  far  from  clear  that  the
    appellant would succeed on an entry clearance application.  If  he  did
    make an application in Vietnam, the Home Office guidance on  processing
    times showed that 100 percent of settlement applications were completed
    within 30 days.

21.  Mr Talacchi said that the assessment was fact sensitive.  The  evidence
    showed that significant difficulties would be faced by the appellant or
    his wife, amounting  to  insurmountable  obstacles  within  the  rules.
    There were cumulative factors.  The appellant's daughters' evidence was
    important.  They referred to their mother's depression and mental  ill-
    health and her physical problems.  Ms Cheung had a lack of mobility and
    there would be real difficulties finding a place to  stay  in  Vietnam.
    There were insufficient finances to enable the appellant and  his  wife
    to establish themselves there.  Although they had some ties to Vietnam,
    these were meagre.  The Tribunal ought  to  conclude  that  the  family
    members remaining there would be unable to assist.

22.  Ms Cheung was in receipt of ESA and unable to work at  present.   There
    was nothing to show any similar benefit or assistance  in  Vietnam.   A
    summary of the medical treatment  she  had  received  appeared  in  the
    appellant's bundle at page 200.  She had limited mobility and there had
    been extensive surgery over the years.  She  was  described  as  having
    substantial residual functional loss.  The prognosis in 2012  was  that
    she would be unlikely to return to work for at least two years.   There
    were ongoing medical issues, as set  out  in  the  GP's  letter  and  a
    general worsening in Ms Cheung's health since 2010.

23.   If  an  assessment  were  required  outside  the  rules,  there   were
    exceptional circumstances which would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for the appellant and his wife.  Ms Cheung had lived  here
    since she was 16.  So far as the public  interest  was  concerned,  the
    bank statements in the appellant's bundle showed that she has  received
    disability living allowance, housing benefit and council  tax  benefit.
    As his spouse was in receipt of these benefits when the application was
    made, the appellant was  exempt  from  the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  The resources available were sufficient to show  that  he
    could be adequately maintained.  So far as a temporary  separation  was
    concerned, should the appellant return to  Vietnam  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application, this would remove the care he provided  for  his
    wife on a day-to-day basis.  Again, the  two  daughters  gave  evidence
    regarding the importance of that support to enable their mother to cope
    and to promote her mental health.

Findings and Conclusions

24.  We first assess whether the  appellant  has  shown,  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities, that there are insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
    with Ms Cheung continuing outside the United Kingdom, under EX.1.(b) of
    Appendix FM to the rules.  It is not in dispute that he has  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with his wife, a  British  citizen.   EX.2,
    inserted into the  rules  with  effect  from  28th  July  2014  but  of
    application in this  case,  provides  that  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    means "the very significant difficulties which will  be  faced  by  the
    applicant or their partner in continuing their family together  outside
    the UK and which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
    hardship for the applicant or their partner".

25.  We have taken  into  account  the  Secretary  of  State's  guidance  on
    insurmountable obstacles, contained in  the  IDI  on  family  migration
    published in April 2015.  That guidance contains illustrative  examples
    of difficulties which do not amount, in the Secretary of State's  view,
    to insurmountable obstacles.  They include a  British  citizen  partner
    who has lived here all his life, has friends  and  family  here,  works
    here and speaks  only  English  who  is  faced  with  the  prospect  of
    relocating "half way  across  the  world".   Lack  of  knowledge  of  a
    language spoken in the country of return would not usually amount to an
    insurmountable obstacle and nor would separation from  extended  family
    members unless there were particular exceptional factors in  the  case.
    A material change in quality of  life  would,  similarly,  not  usually
    amount to an insurmountable obstacle and neither would a  reduction  in
    income.  The guidance suggests that an  insurmountable  obstacle  would
    exist if a person was unable to lawfully enter and stay in the  country
    of  return  or  where  cultural  barriers  would  result  in  a  severe
    restriction of a person's rights and freedoms.  The impact of a  mental
    or physical disability is another example although mere hardship  would
    not suffice.  In some circumstances, a lack of health care  might  lead
    to very serious hardship, amounting to an insurmountable obstacle.

26.  Although the appellant has  been  present  here  for  twelve  years,  a
    substantial period of time but insufficient to show that he  meets  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the rules, Ms Cheung has lived here
    for most of her life, having  arrived  long  ago  in  1979  and  having
    naturalised as a British  citizen  twenty  four  years  ago.   Her  two
    daughters were born here and are also British  citizens  and  Ms  Sonia
    married recently.  The medical evidence, which is not challenged, shows
    that Ms Cheung is disabled and has limited mobility and that she  still
    suffers pain on a daily basis notwithstanding  extensive  surgery  over
    the years.  She also  has  some  mental  ill-health,  in  the  form  of
    depression.  Her circumstances are such that she is entitled to ESA and
    she has, in the past, received disability living allowance (before  the
    introduction of ESA).  Her housing costs are met by  means  of  welfare
    benefits.

27.  The appellant and his wife retain modest ties to  Vietnam,  his  mother
    living in Saigon with his sister and Ms Cheung's mother in  Hanoi.   We
    accept the evidence we heard from the witnesses  that  these  relatives
    live in rather straightened circumstances, in poor accommodation  which
    is also limited in size.  Overall, we find that they would be unable to
    assist in any substantial way with relocation, should the appellant and
    Ms Cheung return to Vietnam or should the appellant return there alone.



28.  So far as an application for entry clearance abroad  is  concerned,  we
    accept Mr Whitwell's submission that there is no certain  prospect  of
    success at all.  We do  not  speculate  on  the  outcome  of  any  such
    application, were it to be made,  in  the  light  of   SB  (Bangladesh)
    [2007] EWCA Civ 28, and we also find  that  any  period  of  separation
    would also be uncertain, should Ms Cheung remain in the United Kingdom,
    notwithstanding  the  efficient  service  at  the  overseas   post   in
    completing visa applications.

29.  We found the evidence of Ms Sonia and Ms Stacey impressive in  relation
    to  the  closeness  of  the  family  ties.   Although  they  now   live
    independently, we do not doubt that they retain close  bonds  to  their
    parents and we accept what they said about  the  practical,  day-to-day
    support the appellant provides to their mother.  Although the remaining
    bonds between the daughters and their parents  fall  short  of  showing
    family life in themselves, they are plainly a material  factor  in  the
    assessment which, accepting Mr  Talacchi's  submission,  is  one  which
    involves consideration of the relevant factors cumulatively.

30.  If the focus were put on any of the salient features  individually,  we
    doubt that an insurmountable obstacle or obstacles would be shown.   It
    is clear that some factors fall  within  the  guidance,  including  the
    separation from Ms Sonia and Ms Stacey that  would  result  should  the
    appellant or both parents return to Vietnam.   Similarly,  the  medical
    evidence shows that Ms Cheung suffers from a  physical  disability  and
    has modest mental ill-health.   Her  circumstances  are  sufficient  to
    entitle her to welfare benefits here on the basis that  she  cannot  at
    present work.  Mr Whitwell is right that there is no definite prognosis
    that she will never return to work but it is clear, on the other  hand,
    that her disability is a practical impediment at present and is  likely
    to be so for some time to come.  That impediment would  be  present  on
    return to Vietnam.

31.  If the appellant and his wife  were  to  return,  so  that  they  could
    continue family  life  in  Vietnam  together,  this  would  necessarily
    involve separation from their daughters.  We have  already  found  that
    the family members who remain  there  would  be  unable  to  offer  any
    substantial practical assistance and Ms Cheung's disability  would,  in
    her particular circumstances, be likely to impede access to employment.
     Return to the country she fled as one of the boat people some 36 years
    ago, and leaving the country of her  present  nationality  twenty  four
    years after she became a British citizen, would, we find, be likely  to
    have an adverse impact on her mental health although we had  no  expert
    evidence on this particular aspect before us.

32.  Should Ms Cheung remain in the  United  Kingdom,  the  appellant  being
    removed or returning alone, this would  result  in  separation  for  an
    uncertain period of time.  Contact with his  daughters  would  also  be
    severed.   Although  practical  help  with  her  disability  might   be
    available from other sources in this  country,  including  perhaps  the
    local authority, Ms Cheung would also lose in her spouse the day-to-day
    carer she relies upon, not merely to assist  with  physical  needs  but
    also, on the evidence, as a bulwark against the return of depression.

33.  Having weighed the evidence overall, and having taken into account  all
    the relevant factors, we conclude that  insurmountable  obstacles  have
    been shown as the continuation of family life abroad would entail  very
    serious hardship for the  appellant  and,  more  so,  Ms  Cheung.   The
    requirement of EX.1.(b) has been met and we allow the  appeal  on  this
    basis.  There is no need for  us  to  proceed  to  make  an  assessment
    outside the rules.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is remade as follows:

The appeal is allowed as the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  have
been met.

ANONYMITY

There has been no application for anonymity and we make no direction.
