Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Khotas (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer}


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the  appellant,  with
    permission, in relation to a Decision and  Reasons  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Freer) promulgated on 26th October 2018.

 2. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan born on 15th September  2002
    and thus a minor.  He arrived in the UK in January 2018,  clandestinely
    and claimed asylum on 7th March 2018. His protection claim was  refused
    by the Secretary of State on 5th September  2018  but  because  of  his
    minority he was granted leave until the age of 17 ï¿½ in accordance  with
    the Secretary of State's policy.

 3. The appellant appealed the refusal of his protection claim and that  is
    the appeal which came before Judge Freer sitting at Taylor house on  19
    October 2018.

 4. In a Decision and Reasons promulgated on 26th October 2018 Judge  Freer
    dismissed the appeal.

 5. Judge Freer noted that the Secretary of State accepted the  appellant's
    age and nationality. It was also accepted  that  his  father  had  been
    kidnapped by the Taliban in or around 2015/2016 and that after that the
    family moved to Jalalabad to live with an uncle for five  months  prior
    to the appellant and his brother leaving the country with the aid of an
    agent. His brother and the appellant became separated on the journey to
    the UK. Judge Freer noted that the issue to be decided was whether  the
    appellant could safely relocate elsewhere in Afghanistan, in particular
    to either Jalalabad or Kabul.

 6. Judge Freer did not believe the appellant's claim to have lost  contact
    with his family.

 7. Judge Freer noted that he had an expert  report  before  him  which  he
    analysed in paragraphs 44 to 59 of the decision. At paragraph 55  Judge
    Freer said:-

         "It is not likely that  when  the  appellant  actually  returns  to
         Afghanistan he will resemble his current appearance or that in 2016
         I find. He will be expected like all male Pashtuns to grow a beard.
         It is therefore not likely that a purely  visual  recognition  will
         occur by chance. In Kabul it is agreed that nobody will search  for
         him by his full name, with its geographical associations.  When  he
         is fully grown, he may relocate to Kabul and work there but he  can
         also be protected by  his  uncle  in  Jalalabad,  which  is  not  a
         situation closely scrutinised in the report, with its  emphasis  on
         living alone."

 8. At paragraph 57 the judge found that the appellant  would  have  skills
    from his time in the UK so that he could find work outside the  Taliban
    and outside Bacha Bazi.

 9. The judge went on at paragraph 63 to  find  that  the  appellant  could
    return to Jalalabad to stay with his uncle  or  go  on  to  Kabul  with
    skills he will have acquired or developed in the UK.

10. At paragraph 68 the judge said that there are  no  substantial  grounds
    shown for believing in a serious risk on  return.  The  appellant  will
    return with an education and will not easily be detected in a city.  At
    his age on return, it is not shown to the low threshold or  above  that
    he will be useful as a suicide bomber. As he would wear  a  beard  like
    any other Pashtun, it is not shown  that  he  would  be  noticed  as  a
    westernised person if he lives in a city.

11. When the matter first came before me in January I  found  the  decision
    contained a material error of law in  that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    consider risk on return as at the  date  of  hearing  but  rather  look
    forward to the date of  actual  return.  That  is  illustrated  by  the
    paragraphs I have referred to above.  As it is risk on return which  is
    the essence of the appeal, the entire decision had to be set aside.  As
    there was no interpreter at the  hearing  in  January  the  matter  was
    adjourned for a resumed hearing.

12. Thus the matter came before me in February.

13. As the historic claims are accepted by the Secretary of  State  it  was
    agreed by both representatives that  the  only  oral  evidence  that  I
    needed to hear from the appellant and his foster carer was with  regard
    to his contact, if any, with members of his family in  Afghanistan.  Mr
    Khotas helpfully conceded that if I were to find the appellant was  not
    in contact with his family then he is a refugee and the  appeal  should
    be allowed on that basis.

14. I heard evidence first from the appellant who adopted his  two  witness
    statements of 30th May and 9th October 2018 as true.

15. The appellant told me that when he and his brother  left  Jalalabad  to
    travel to the UK his older brother did not travel because he has a long-
    term illness and his other brother did not travel because he  was  only
    little. He did not know why his uncle did not travel but  did  indicate
    that the family did not feel safe in Jalalabad. He was  unable  to  say
    whether the rest of the family had discussed leaving. He did  not  know
    anyone in Kabul and he did not know the address  that  the  family  had
    been living at in Jalalabad. He said that the Red Cross  had  not  been
    able to help him find his family and that none of them were  on  social
    media such as Facebook.  He said he had tried to find them by searching
    on Facebook and that he contacted the Red Cross three  months  ago.  He
    had not been questioned at all by the Home Office with  regard  to  the
    whereabouts of his family and does not know whether the Home Office had
    been actively looking for them.

16. In answer to questions from Mr Khotas the appellant confirmed that  his
    father was a farmer and his mother did not work.  The family was  quite
    poor and his uncle in Jalalabad worked in a shop.  It was his uncle who
    had paid for him and his brother to leave Afghanistan.  His  uncle  was
    not wealthy.  He did not know where the money came from.   He  has  not
    had any contact with his family since he arrived in the  UK,  the  last
    time he did was a year before he arrived, when he was  in  France.  His
    family therefore do not know whether he is safe or not.  They  did  not
    give him a sim or a contact number. He confirmed  that  he  had  always
    known he was coming to the UK. When asked why he was trying to find his
    family on Facebook if they had never been on Facebook, he said he could
    not think of any other way.  The first time he looked on Facebook was 4
    to 5 months ago. When asked why it had taken him so  long  to  look  he
    said he had no mobile and no number for his family. He said that he has
    no family at all in the UK.  He is not receiving  any  regular  medical
    treatment nor any counselling or treatment for mental health issues.

17. He said that he had looked on Facebook many times trying to contact his
    family and has heard nothing of his brother since they  were  separated
    on the journey.

18. In re-examination the appellant confirmed that he did not know  whether
    a telephone number had been given to his brother  who  was  older  than
    him.

19. I then heard from the appellant's foster carer. She had been his foster
    carer since 24th January 2018 and the  appellant  has  lived  with  her
    since then. She confirmed the contents of her short statement as  being
    true. When asked if the appellant had made any effort  to  contact  his
    family she said that he had asked her  to  search  Facebook  using  the
    family name and his brother's name. She said that she had contacted the
    Red Cross three months ago but they have not yet had their  appointment
    which is due for next week.  She had never heard him on  the  telephone
    to his family.

20. In response to questions from Mr Khotas she confirmed that she was  not
    with the appellant 24 hours a day because he goes to school. He  has  a
    few friends from school but does not go out much with them.

21. Mr Khotas submitted that I should not believe the appellant's claim not
    to be in contact with or able to contact his family.

22. He submitted that the cost of getting individuals to  the  UK  and  the
    cost of agents is extortionate given the  state  of  finances  of  this
    particular family. There is no evidence of where the  money  came  from
    and the family would want to know that their investment had  paid  off,
    particularly as they always knew that the appellant was coming  to  the
    UK.  The appellant is a young son so they would want to know that he is
    safe. On the appellant's evidence they don't even know where he is.  He
    submitted that they could have given him a  phone  number  or  Sim.  He
    pointed to the fact that the appellant's attempts to contact his family
    had been at the behest of his foster carer and only very  recently.  He
    had done nothing for several months after he arrived  in  the  UK.   He
    submitted that as a 16-year-old the appellant  would  be  desperate  to
    know about his family and it was not credible that he would wait months
    before trying to  contact  them.  He  pointed  to  the  fact  that  the
    appellant  is  not  suffering  from   depression   or   receiving   any
    counselling.

23. He relied on paragraph 10 of EU and others  (Afghanistan)  [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 32. There Sir Stanley Burton had said this:-

         "Lastly, I should mention a point made by the  Secretary  of  State
         which I consider to  have  substance.  Unaccompanied  children  who
         arrive in this country from Afghanistan have done so as a result of
         someone, presumably their families, paying for  their  fare  and/or
         for a so-called agent to arrange their journey to this country. The
         costs incurred by the family would have been considerable, relative
         to the wealth of the average  Afghan  family.  The  motivation  for
         their incurring that cost may be that their child faces risk if  he
         or she remains with them in Afghanistan, or it may simply  be  that
         they believe that their child will  have  a  better  life  in  this
         country. Either way, they are unlikely to  be  happy  to  cooperate
         with an agent of the Secretary of State for  the  return  of  their
         child  to  Afghanistan,  which  would  mean  the  waste  of   their
         investment in his or her journey here."

24. Ms  McCarthy  submitted  that  it  was  entirely  plausible  that  this
    appellant would not have a contact number for his family  and  entirely
    plausible that they would have given such contact number to  his  older
    brother rather than him. She pointed to the fact that the appellant was
    only around 13 or 14 when he left  Afghanistan.  She  referred  to  the
    evidence of the foster carer who knows the appellant intimately and who
    had seen no evidence of his having any contact  with  his  family.  The
    foster carer actively helps the appellant try and search for his family
    on social media and contacted the Red Cross. In contrast,  she  pointed
    to the complete lack of any  evidence  from  the  Home  Office  of  any
    attempt to trace the family. She pointed  to  the  screening  interview
    where the appellant had given full information giving  his  address  in
    his home village and the full names and ages of his family members.

My findings

25. There is force in Mr Khotas' arguments based on what  was  said  in  EU
    (Afghanistan). It is true that sending the appellant and his brother to
    the UK would have cost this family of limited means an enormous  amount
    of money and it would appear to make no sense that they would have sent
    him halfway across the world without any way of his contacting them  to
    let them know that he had arrived safely. It is also telling  that  for
    someone so young when he left his family, he appears to be  in  no  way
    depressed or upset about a lack of contact.

26. It is true that the Secretary of State, as confirmed in the  letter  of
    refusal has made no attempt to trace the family saying at paragraph 79:-
    "unfortunately, we have been unable to take any  substantive  steps  in
    Afghanistan to locate your family using the information and in  country
    family tracing avenues available to the Home Office at this time." That
    provides no information as to what, if any, attempts  could  have  been
    made but it does make clear that the Secretary of  State  has  in  fact
    made no real effort to trace the family.

27. Whilst I can see force in Mr Khotas' arguments, I am also struck by the
    evidence of the foster mother who  suggested  that  the  appellant  was
    desperate to get in touch with his family which is why she was  helping
    and that she had seen no evidence at all in the 12 months that  he  has
    been with her that he had been in contact with his family.  It  may  be
    the  appellant's  parents  entrusted  the  means  of  contact  to   the
    appellant's older brother rather than the appellant.

28. I bear in mind the low standard of proof and the appellant's youth. The
    appellant has not failed to cooperate with the Secretary of  State  and
    has provided all the information requested of him. I accept that he  is
    not in contact with his family and does not know where they  are.  That
    being the case, as accepted by Mr Khotas the appellant  succeeds  under
    the Refugee Convention.



Decision

29. The appeal is allowed on asylum grounds. The appellant is a refugee.

30. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity direction. I also make one.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
