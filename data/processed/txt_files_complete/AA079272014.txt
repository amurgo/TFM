                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Ms Faryl, instructed by IAS (Manchester)
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy promulgated  3.12.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  respondent,  dated
    19.9.14, to refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights
    claims.  The Judge heard the appeal on 23.11.14.

 2. Designated Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 2.3.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I find no error of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that the determination  of
    Judge Foudy should be set aside.

 5. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Zucker considered  it  arguable
    that the judge erred in law in failing to have regard  to  the  Country
    Guidance case of AT & Others (Article 15c: risk  categories)  Libya  CG
    [2014] UKUT 00318 (IAC).

 6. Whilst it may be deduced from �24 that the judge had some case  law  in
    mind, when she stated "the Tribunal has accepted that if a person has a
    well-founded  fear  of  persecution  by  armed  militias  there  is  no
    effective state protection for him and no feasible internal  relocation
    option," there was no reference to AT & Others.

 7. AT & Others held that  (i)  having  regard  to  the  generally  hostile
    attitude of society  to  the  former  regime,  the  following  are,  in
    general, at real risk of persecution  or  Article  3  ill-treatment  on
    return to Libya:  -  (a)  former  high  ranking  officials  within  the
    intelligence services of that regime; (b) others with an association at
    senior level with that regime; (ii) As a general matter, the closer  an
    individual was to the centre of power within  the  former  regime,  the
    more likely that the individual will be able to  establish  a  risk  of
    persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return; (iii) the majority of
    the population of Libya either worked for, had some  association  with,
    or has a member of the family who worked for or had an association with
    the Qadhafi  regime.  Such  employment  or  association  alone  is  not
    sufficient to establish  a  risk  of  persecution  or  Article  3  ill-
    treatment on return; (iv) in general, family members of those described
    in (i) and (ii) above are not at risk of persecution  or  a  breach  of
    their protected rights on return. It  is  possible,  however,  that  an
    individual will be able to establish such a risk but this will need  to
    be demonstrated by  specific  evidence  relating  to  the  individual's
    circumstances. Mere assertion of risk by association as a family member
    would not be sufficient without fact-specific evidence of the  risk  to
    that particular family member.

 8. Judge Foudy made no reference to the above when stating at �19 that  as
    it was credible that the claimant had cousins who fought  for  Gaddafi,
    as a great many Libyans did, his cousins' political  allegiances  might
    well haunt the claimant on removal. However, the judge did  make  fact-
    specific findings in  the  same  paragraph,  to  the  effect  that  she
    accepted as credible that the  claimant  had  been  perceived  as  pro-
    Gaddafi in 2012/2013 and thus found that he was likely to be  suspected
    of the same allegiance on removal.

 9. Applying AT & Others to  the  findings  of  fact,  this  was  not  mere
    assertion of risk but fact-specific evidence that the claimant would be
    at risk on return,  for  cogent  reasons  open  to  the  judge  on  the
    evidence. In the circumstances, any failure to refer to AT & Others was
    not material to the outcome of the appeal, as on the findings of  fact,
    it was open to the judge to find that the claimant would be at risk  on
    return.

10. The other grounds of appeal address the absence of reference to section
    117B of  the  2002  Act  and  the  deficiency  of  the  proportionality
    assessment. However, as the  findings  on  human  rights  were  in  the
    alternative, no material error is disclosed.

11. I also note that the finding of the judge at �25 that it was not in the
    best interests of the two children to be returned  to  a  situation  of
    internal armed conflict in Libya, was not the subject of any ground  of
    appeal by the Secretary of State and stands unchallenged.

Conclusion & Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
