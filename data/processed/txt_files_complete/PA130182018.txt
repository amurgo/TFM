Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms K Tobin, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant appeals with the  permission  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
       against a decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Courtney
       dismissing his appeal against a decision of the respondent, dated  2
       November 2018, refusing his protection claim.


    2. The appellant is an adult Sri Lankan national of Tamil ethnicity. He
       arrived in the UK on 9 May 2018 and claimed asylum. The  appellant's
       account was, in summary, as follows. In August 2006 he was  forcibly
       recruited into the LTTE. He received three months' training. He  was
       then placed in an infantry unit and sent to fight in  Mannar.  After
       one day he was pulled back from the front  line  and  injured  in  a
       shell attack whilst taking food to  an  officer.  After  a  week  in
       hospital he was assigned duties as a walkie-talkie operator  passing
       on messages. The appellant continued in this post for the  next  two
       years. Orders were received to relocate to Valayanmadam and  it  was
       realised they would have to pass through  an  army-controlled  area.
       The appellant was given a pass to go to  a  distribution  centre  to
       collect food. Instead of returning to the camp, he  went  to  nearby
       Mathalan and join his mother.


    3. In April 2009  the  appellant  and  his  mother  entered  the  army-
       controlled area with the appellant passing as a  civilian.  However,
       he was stopped, interrogated and beaten. He denied being in the LTTE
       and refused to give his name. He and his mother were taken to a camp
       in Cheddikuliam where they remained for six months. After that  time
       a cousin in Vavuniya managed to get them released and, in 2010, they
       were permitted to return to Puthukudiyiruppu.


    4. The appellant had no further problems until October 2013 when he was
       abducted by in a van whom he believes to  have  been  CID  and  army
       personnel. He recognised one of the occupants of the van as an  LTTE
       member. They were taken for questioning and the  appellant  admitted
       he was a member of the LTTE. He was asked  about  where  the  LTTE's
       weapons were. He said he did not know and he was kicked and  beaten.
       He was detained for two and half years in a building in  the  jungle
       during which time he was questioned and tortured. On 11  March  2016
       someone took him out of his cell to a waiting  van  driven  by  army
       personnel. He was taken to Wattala where his uncle explained he  had
       secured his release by the payment of a bribe.


    5. The appellant said the CID and police have visited his  parents  and
       cousin searching for him. On 12 May 2016, the appellant returned  to
       Puthukudiyiruppu to get married. The police found out  and  searched
       for him. The next day the appellant left for Point  Pedro  where  he
       remained for five months, keeping a low profile. He then returned to
       Wattala to the house of an agent, who obtained a passport  for  him.
       He left Sri Lanka by air  on  28  February  2017.  He  was  escorted
       through security by an officer associated with the agent.


    6. Since his departure from Sri Lanka, CID officers have been  visiting
       both his house and that of his  father-in-law  enquiring  about  his
       whereabouts. The family have been threatened. The appellant has been
       active in the TGTE, attending demonstrations as a  result  of  which
       his photograph has appeared in the media.


    7. The respondent  rejected  the  appellant's  claim.  His  account  of
       spending time in the  LTTE  was  considered  both  inconsistent  and
       contradictory. It was rejected. The respondent also considered there
       were inconsistencies in the appellant's account of his problems with
       the authorities and these were also rejected.


    8. The appellant appealed on protection grounds. His appeal  was  heard
       by Judge Courtney on 12 December 2018 and dismissed on  all  grounds
       in a decision promulgated on 11 January 2013.

    9. In a lengthy, detailed and carefully constructed decision, the judge
       found that she was satisfied on the lower standard of proof that the
       appellant was forcibly recruited to the LTTE in August 2006 and that
       he was detained from October 2013  until  March  2016  when  he  was
       released on payment of  a  bribe.  She  accepted  that,  during  his
       detention, the appellant was physically abused.  She  noted  he  has
       scarring and he suffers from PTSD as a result  of  his  experiences.
       However, she found there was no reliable evidence that there  was  a
       court order or arrest warrant which would result in the  appellant's
       name appearing on a computerised "stop" list  at  the  airport.  She
       accepted the appellant had spent a short time in London, which was a
       diaspora hotspot, and  that  he  has  attended  a  small  number  of
       demonstrations.


   10. In relation to the  appellant's  sur  place  activities,  the  judge
       accepted he was a member of the TGTE but did not accept that,  being
       a member for some six months without playing any significant role in
       the organisation would bring him to the adverse attention of the Sri
       Lankan authorities. Nor did she accept that enquiries had been  made
       with the appellant's family in the wake of his  departure  from  Sri
       Lanka. She dismissed the protection claim  on  the  basis  that  the
       appellant would not be perceived to be  a  destabilising  threat  in
       post-conflict Sri Lanka.


   11. The judge gave separate  consideration  to  the  appellant's  mental
       health.  There  was  medical  evidence  suggesting  the  appellant's
       suicide risk was moderate but the judge noted  the  absence  of  any
       history of attempted suicide and considered the presence of his wife
       and family in Sri Lanka would be  a  protective  factor.  The  judge
       noted  the   appellant   had   been   prescribed   mirtazapine,   an
       antidepressant, and that he was receiving counselling.


   12. The appellant applied for permission to appeal which was refused  in
       the first instance by the First-tier Tribunal.


   13. The renewed grounds seeking permission to appeal made  a  number  of
       challenges to Judge Courtney's decision.


   14. Firstly, the judge failed to consider the impact of the  appellant's
       past persecution by reference to paragraph 339K of  the  Immigration
       Rules. The appellant had been detained in  post-conflict  Sri  Lanka
       for almost 2� years at a time when the focus of the authorities  was
       on those they perceived to be seeking to destabilise  the  integrity
       of Sri Lanka.


   15. Secondly, the judge misdirected herself  in  law  in  rejecting  the
       appellant's  claim  that  the  authorities  had  visited  his  house
       enquiring about  his  whereabouts.  She  should  not  have  required
       corroboration and, given  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  been
       released informally, the judge was required to assess the  claim  in
       the context of the background evidence.


   16.  Thirdly,  the  judge  made  errors  when  assessing   whether   the
       appellant's name was likely  to  be  on  the  "stop"  list.  Country
       guidance showed that an informal release was likely to be treated as
       an escape such that absconder action would be taken.


   17. Fourthly, the judge's assessment of whether the appellant  would  be
       viewed as a destabilising  influence  on  return  to  Sri  Lanka  by
       reference to his activities in the UK was flawed. The appellant will
       be questioned on arrival and cannot be expected to lie in  order  to
       avoid the consequences of his membership of the  TGTE,  which  is  a
       proscribed organisation.


   18. Fifthly and finally, the judge erred in her assessment of the mental
       health claim with particular reference to the risk of  suicide.  The
       judge failed to address the central  issue  which  was  whether  the
       appellant had the means or capacity to access  any  treatment  which
       was available in Sri Lanka so as to avoid the risk of suicide.


   19. Granting permission to appeal, Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kebede  found
       arguable merit in the argument that the judge's  assessment  of  the
       risk on return was flawed owing to a failure to  consider  the  fact
       the appellant had been detained for 2� years  in  post-conflict  Sri
       Lanka and to take that into account when  considering  his  diaspora
       activities.  She  found  little  arguable  merit   in   the   ground
       challenging the judge's findings on article 3 but  did  not  exclude
       it. All grounds could be argued.


   20. No rule 24 response has been filed by the respondent.


   21. I heard submissions from the representatives as to whether the First-
       tier Tribunal Judge made an error of law in her decision.


   22. Ms Tobin's submissions  largely  followed  the  grounds  which  were
       drafted by her colleague. She argued the judge's assessment  of  the
       risk to the appellant on return was flawed  because  she  failed  to
       give weight to the relevance of the appellant's past persecution  in
       the context that he had been detained after the  end  of  the  civil
       war. At the time he was detained he fell within the risk  categories
       described in GJ and Others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka  CG
       [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC). As  such,  the  judge's  finding  that  the
       appellant as not at risk  on  return  was  not  in  accordance  with
       country guidance. She  relied  heavily  on  the  Court  of  Appeal's
       judgment in ME (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1486,  although
       this case does not appear to have been cited to the judge.

   23. Ms Tobin argued there  was  a  further  failure  to  follow  country
       guidance with respect to the judge's consideration of the nature  of
       the appellant's release. Had she done so she would have  come  to  a
       different conclusion as to whether the appellant  would  be  on  the
       "stop" list or a watch list.

   24. Ms  Tobin  argued  that,  coupled  with  his  adverse  history,  the
       appellant's sur place activities with the TGTE would have placed him
       at risk.

   25. Ms Everett agreed that, in line with ME,  an  "exceptionally  strong
       case" would  be  needed  before  it  could  be  concluded  that  the
       appellant would not be at risk on return. However,  she  argued  the
       judge's assessment was sufficient to show that  was  the  case.  She
       argued the judge had been entitled  to  reach  the  conclusions  she
       reached on the appellant's sur place activities.


   26. I have carefully considered the submissions. Having  done  so  I  am
       forced to the conclusion that the judge's decision is  erroneous  in
       law and should be set aside, albeit her  findings  of  fact  can  be
       preserved. My reasons are as follows.


   27. As noted, the judge made many positive findings of fact and accepted
       the majority of  the  appellant's  account,  including  the  salient
       points that he was a former member of  the  LTTE  and  he  had  been
       detained for 2� years between October 2013 and March 2016,  when  he
       was released on payment of  a  bribe.  The  judge  accepted  he  was
       tortured during his detention. She also accepted his activities with
       the TGTE.

   28. The judge followed the guidance in GJ & Ors scrupulously  and  noted
       that the appellant's past activities are likely to  be  regarded  as
       indicative of present sympathies. However,  she  reasoned  that  the
       authorities  would  no  longer  hold  an  adverse  interest  in  the
       appellant because the government's concern was now whether a  person
       is a destabilising threat in post-conflict Sri Lanka.

   29. That is all legally correct. However, in ME, a  case  in  which  the
       appellant had been a member of the LTTE and  had  been  detained  in
       December 2014 for questioning about the LTTE's weapons caches during
       which time he was beaten, the Court of Appeal found  the  judge  had
       erred in concluding the appellant would no longer  be  of  interest.
       Lewison LJ said:
          "16. The following are, in my  judgment,  the  pertinent  points.
          ME's arrest took place long after the cessation of  the  conflict
          in Sri Lanka. That led (or ought to have led) to  the  conclusion
          that he was perceived  at  that  time  as  being  of  significant
          interest to the authorities. He was therefore a  person  who  had
          fallen into category (a) of the risk categories identified in GJ.
          It would have needed an exceptionally strong case to persuade the
          FTT that he had now ceased to be at risk. The mere fact  that  he
          was released without charge and  without  reporting  restrictions
          was not  enough,  because  the  authorities  not  only  made  two
          subsequent visits to his home; but they  also  searched  it.  The
          conclusion that should be drawn from that is that ME was still  a
          person  of  significant  interest;   and   moreover,   that   the
          authorities perceived that he might have more to  tell  them.  Mr
          Jolliffe, in support of the FTT's decision, submitted that ME was
          no longer a person of interest because the  authorities  had  got
          what they wanted from him. But that does not explain why,  having
          obtained the information from ME about the location of  one  arms
          cache, the authorities nevertheless twice visited  his  home  and
          searched it. Thus, the FTT was right to proceed on the basis that
          there was a real risk that the authorities would wish to question
          him further.
          17. What, then, persuaded the FTT that there was no real risk  of
          the questioning taking place in detention? It seems  to  me  that
          the FTT's conclusion is founded on its  perception  that  ME  had
          passed on the information that he had; and that  if  he  had  any
          more he would be willing to give it over. The parenthesis in [39]
          is not a finding that ME had no more information. Rather it is  a
          finding that he is willing to give over such  information  as  he
          has. ME may be truthful in saying that  if  he  has  any  further
          information he will hand it  over;  and  the  FTT  was  no  doubt
          justified in believing him. But that is not, in  my  judgment,  a
          complete answer. The real question  is  whether  the  Sri  Lankan
          authorities  would  believe  him;  or  perhaps  to  put  it  more
          accurately whether there was a real risk that they would not. The
          FTT's finding could only be a complete answer if  the  FTT  could
          have been satisfied that the Sri Lankan authorities would  accept
          at face value, and without  further  beating  or  detention,  the
          completeness of any further revelation that ME  might  make.  The
          FTT does not confront that question. As Ms  Jegarajah  submitted,
          those who torture others do so for a variety of reasons, not  all
          of them rational. The authorities had already had some success in
          extracting information from ME after  beating  him;  which  shows
          that at least at that time they did not  accept  his  account  at
          face value. What had changed in the conduct  of  the  Sri  Lankan
          authorities? The FTT did not explain  this.  Where,  as  here,  a
          person has been tortured for alleged participation  in  political
          crimes a heightened degree of scrutiny is required: R (Sivakumar)
          v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2003]  UKHL  14,
          [2003] 1 WLR 840 at [16]."
   30. As already noted, Ms Everett accepted the test was whether there was
       an exceptionally strong case so as to find the authorities would  no
       longer have any interest in the appellant notwithstanding  the  fact
       they clearly did so long after the end of the civil war.


   31. In fairness to the judge, it does not appear that ME  was  cited  to
       her by counsel appearing on behalf of  the  appellant.  It  was  not
       mentioned in his skeleton argument. However, the case did not change
       the law; it simply illustrated how GJ & Ors  should  be  applied  in
       circumstances that there had been past persecution some years  after
       the conflict ended. The error by the judge was  to  read  paragraphs
       365(2) and (3) of GJ & Ors, which as the judge noted was approved by
       the Court of Appeal in MP (Sri Lanka) & Anr [2014] EWCA Civ 829,  as
       if the end of the conflict meant that  post-conflict  detention  was
       not a strong indicator of  adverse  interest  and  therefore  future
       risk.

   32. I have noted the judge rejected  the  appellant's  evidence  of  the
       authorities visiting his home after  he  had  fled  Sri  Lanka.  The
       safety of this finding was also  the  subject  of  challenge  by  Ms
       Tobin. However, I do not find any error on this matter to  make  any
       difference. Even without that particular finding, the appellant  was
       entitled to much greater weight being  given  to  the  fact  he  was
       detained for 2� years until March 2016, some seven years  after  the
       end of the conflict.

   33. The second error which I find material to the outcome of the  appeal
       concerns the issue of the appellant's release. The judge noted  this
       had been achieved "informally" through the payment of a  bribe.  She
       reasoned that his release had taken place 2� years earlier and  that
       there was no reliable evidence of a court order or arrest warrant so
       as to lead to the appellant appearing on the "stop" list.

   34. However, in GJ & Ors, the Upper  Tribunal  heard  evidence  from  Mr
       Anton Punethanayagam, a barrister  who  has  practised  at  the  Sri
       Lankan Bar in both Colombo and Vavuniya. The  judge  refers  to  his
       evidence, which was accepted by the Upper Tribunal. At paragraph 146
       of GJ & Ors, the following is recorded:

          "Approximately thirty of Mr  Punethanayagam's  3,000  clients  had
          contacted  him  after  having  left  Sri  Lanka  when  of  adverse
          interest, using bribery.  He did not say when that  had  occurred.
          Information from Mr Punethanayagam's client database about the use
          of bribery was as follows:

             "26. ...The paramilitary groups, working  alongside  the  SLA,
             assist the escape of detainees in order to extort money. In my
             practice, I have come across several cases where the  families
             use bribery as a last  resort  to  secure  the  release  of  a
             detainee with the assistance of members of the security forces
             or paramilitary groups.

             27. The bribery is very common in the IDP camps as well as the
             detention centers from which  even  known  LTTE  leaders  have
             managed to escape on payment of bribes.  Hence  it  cannot  be
             argued that only people of low interest to the authorities are
             able to secure their release through a bribe. In  my  opinion,
             it is plausible that the detainee was released  following  the
             payment of a bribe, even if of significant adverse interest to
             the authorities. It is unlikely that the  person  who  accepts
             the bribe would access the detainee's record and  change  them
             as released or  no  longer  wanted.  Hence  such  cases  would
             normally be recorded as escaped from detention in the database
             of the  Police.  Subsequently  an  absconder  action  will  be
             commenced and the detainee's details would be  passed  to  the
             National Intelligence Bureau.

             28. It is possible to leave the country using bribery with the
             help of  an  agent.  The  security  officers  and  immigration
             officers at the international airport are no exception to  the
             widespread bribery and corruption in Sri Lanka. It  is  always
             possible for a person to  use  influence  or  bribery  to  get
             through the airport without being detained as an LTTE suspect.
             I have been contacted by approximately 30 clients who  managed
             to flee the country via the international  airport  whilst  in
             the  adverse  interest  of  the  authorities  and  I  provided
             evidence in their asylum cases  in  the  UK,  Canada,  France,
             Norway and Australia. Therefore leaving  through  the  airport
             either with his/her own passport or false  identity  does  not
             necessarily indicate a lack of interest on  the  part  of  the
             authorities."

             The witness' opinion that absconder action would be  commenced
             after a person was released on  payment  of  a  bribe  is  not
             sourced."


   35. At paragraph 275, the Upper Tribunal said this:



         "Mr Anton Punethanayagam's evidence is that of a  practitioner  who
         has dealt with 3000 cases of detainees, in  Colombo  and  Vavuniya.
         His evidence on the process of bribery was particularly useful.  We
         did not have the opportunity of hearing him give oral evidence, and
         some of his evidence goes beyond what  he  can  be  taken  to  know
         himself but where his evidence concerns the criminal  processes  in
         Sri Lanka, we consider that it is useful  and  reliable.   We  take
         particular account of his view that the seriousness of any  charges
         against an individual are not determinative of whether a bribe  can
         be paid, and that it is possible to leave through the airport  even
         when a person is being actively sought."


   36. It follows from this that the country guidance in GJ & Ors should be
       read as meaning that an informal release through the  payment  of  a
       bribe would be officially recorded as an escape such that  absconder
       action might be taken. This should have been considered by the judge
       and, had she done so, the outcome of  the  appeal  might  have  been
       different,  particularly  when  the   previous   point   about   the
       seriousness of the adverse interest in the appellant demonstrated by
       his past persecution is factored in.


   37. It is not necessary to consider the other three grounds raised by Ms
       Tobin.


   38. Having decided to set aside the appeal, I see no reason  to  deprive
       the appellant of any of the positive findings made by Judge Courtney
       and I shall re-make the decision accordingly.


   39. It follows from the preceding discussion that I regard the fact that
       the appellant was detained when he was and for how long  he  was  as
       being a strong indicator of significant adverse  interest  which  is
       reasonably likely to have remained  notwithstanding  the  change  of
       focus since the end of the conflict. As late as 2016  the  appellant
       was regarded as a threat to security.

   40. Furthermore, the fact the appellant's release would be  recorded  as
       an escape is at least a matter which is going to lead  to  his  name
       being on the watch-list. This, according to GJ & Ors, would not lead
       to his detention at  the  airport  but  he  would  be  subjected  to
       monitoring on return to his home area.  Whether  monitoring  by  the
       security services will lead to his  detention  will  depend  on  any
       diaspora activities he has undertaken.

   41. In this case it has been found that the appellant is a member of the
       TGTE.

   42. In UB (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ  85  the  Court  of  Appeal
       considered the duty of the  respondent  to  have  disclosed  to  the
       tribunal her own policy guidance document  (a  COI  report  entitled
       Tamil Separatism, issued on 28 August 2014), to which  were  annexed
       letters from the British High Commission in Sri Lanka. Those letters
       stated  that  the  TGTE  was  a  proscribed  organisation  and  that
       government sources had stated that  individuals  belonging  to  that
       organisation would face arrest under anti-terrorism laws. There  had
       been no arrests to date but returnees may be questioned  on  arrival
       about involvement  with  such  diaspora  groups.  This  was  "normal
       practice". A returnee may be detained after questioning.


   43. The issue in this appeal is the consequence  for  the  appellant  of
       being questioned about his diaspora  activities  and,  specifically,
       his activities with a proscribed organisation which expressly  seeks
       Tamil independence. He could not be expected to lie when  questioned
       (RT (Zimbabwe) [2012] UKSC 38).


   44. On my reading of the case, it is plain that the court indicated that
       mere membership of the TGTE was not always enough  to  show  a  real
       risk on return, despite the fact one would imagine  that  membership
       of a proscribed organisation would ordinarily lead to prosecution.

   45. I find that the appellant's  past  experiences  of  detention  point
       strongly towards the authorities  maintaining  an  interest  in  him
       which would only be heightened as a result of his being recorded  as
       an escapee and by any admissions he makes about joining the TGTE  in
       the UK. The appellant has established substantial grounds showing he
       is at a real risk of further ill-treatment on return to Sri Lanka.


   46. The appellant's appeal is allowed on protection grounds.  I  do  not
       need to consider the article 3 ground separately.

   47.  The  anonymity  direction  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal   is
       continued.
