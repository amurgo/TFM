Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Martin, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    E B Grant dismissing his appeal against the refusal of his  application
    for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant that was refused
    on 23rd September  2015.   The  decision  dismissing  that  appeal  was
    promulgated on 13th March 2017.  The Appellant  appealed  against  that
    decision and was granted permission to appeal  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Boyes.  The grounds upon which  permission  was  granted  may  be
    summarised as follows:

         "The grounds assert that the Judge did not comprehend correctly the
         complex factual matrix.

         It is rare that errors of fact will  ever  manifest  themselves  as
         errors of law but in this instance I  find  that  the  grounds  are
         arguable."

 2. I was provided with a Rule 24 response from the  Respondent  which  was
    considered by all parties before the hearing commenced.

Error of Law

 3. At the close of submissions I reserved my decision which  I  shall  now
    give.  I do find that there is an error in law  in  the  decision  such
    that it should be set aside.  My reasons for so finding are as follows.

 4. Although the grant of permission speaks of mistakes of fact, Mr  Martin
    crystallised his  grounds  under  the  headings  of  fairness  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal being unsustainable on the evidence
    put forward by the Respondent.

 5. Dealing with those arguments in turn it is alleged that the  judge  has
    failed to deal with an issue raised by the Appellant,  namely  that  he
    did not have the opportunity to provide evidence  in  response  to  the
    issues raised in the refusal, namely as to the  availability  of  funds
    from Equinox Venture Capital LLP.  In that  respect  I  note  that  the
    decision of Judge Grant does unfortunately fail to examine  the  ground
    of appeal in terms of the decision not being in accordance with the law
    and a consideration instead is made only  in  respect  of  whether  the
    decision is in accordance with the Immigration Rules.  Thus there is an
    omission on the face of the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

 6. In respect of whether that omission is material or not, I note from the
    history of the Appellant's challenge of the various decisions that  his
    application was initially refused in January 2014 and in  that  refusal
    he was awarded full points under all of the  appendices  but  was  only
    refused as the Secretary of State said his leave had been curtailed and
    the application was made more than 28 days later.  It was only after  a
    successful judicial review challenge to  that  decision  was  that  the
    decision was withdrawn and  a  fresh  refusal  was  issued  dated  24th
    September 2015.

 7. Albeit Ms Willocks-Briscoe said that the Appellant would have been in a
    position to address the Secretary of State on  the  attributes  to  his
    points-based application, given that the previous decision was made  on
    the basis that he had scored points and the second  decision  following
    the judicial review was made on the basis  that  no  points  were  then
    awarded for Appendix A but were awarded for Appendices B and  C,  there
    is foundation for the argument that the decision may have not  been  in
    accordance with the law given that the Appellant was not provided  with
    an opportunity to make representations upon this  issue  prior  to  the
    refusal of 24th September 2015 being framed in those different terms to
    the previous decision of January 2014.

 8. In reaching this view I have considered the  decision  of  the  Supreme
    Court in Bank Mellat v Her Majesty's Treasury (No  2)  [2013]  UKSC  39
    wherein at paragraphs 100 and 178  to  179  of  the  decision  of  Lord
    Neuberger (formerly the President of the Supreme Court)  the  authority
    of R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Doody [1994]
    1 AC 531 was affirmed and in particular Lord  Mustill's  pronouncements
    of common law fairness which include the principle that:

         "...Fairness will very often require  that  a  person  who  may  be
         adversely affected by the decision will have an opportunity to make
         representations ... either before the  decision  is  taken  ...  or
         after it is taken, with a view to procuring its modification...".

 9. In my view that dicta applies  here  and  as  such  the  error  in  not
    considering this argument and whether the  decision  is  in  accordance
    with the law is a material one.

10. Before turning to the second ground, I also  note  that  the  Appellant
    could, if he had  been  asked  by  the  Respondent,  have  put  forward
    evidence of availability of funding in  the  form  of  a  letter  dated
    February 2017 at AB/123 of the Appellant's bundle  which  alleges  that
    funds were still  available  to  the  Appellant  from  Equinox  Venture
    Capital.  I observe that this letter is dated after the involvement  of
    the maligned executive officers in Profectus/Providentia ended  in  May
    2015 and consequently that the availability of funds cannot necessarily
    be connected to the previous activities of  the  company  when  it  was
    under different directorship  and/or  leadership.   As  such,  this  is
    evidence which goes  to  the  materiality  of  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should have considered whether the decision was in  accordance
    with the law or  not,  although  not  as  to  whether  the  funds  were
    available to the  Appellant  at  the  date  of  application  given  the
    prohibitions on new evidence  in  a  points-based  appeal  pursuant  to
    Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

11.  In  respect  of  the  second  ground  and  whether  the  decision  was
    unsustainable on the evidence put forward by the Respondent, Mr  Martin
    carefully took me to the evidence in the Respondent's bundle which,  at
    its highest, consisted of a piece  of  Home  Office  Guidance  entitled
    "Operation Slipknot: Equinox Cases" at  Annex  F  which  in  particular
    stated at Annex F3 under a heading  "Implications  for  Equinox  cases"
    that the conclusions reached by the First-tier Tribunal in  a  November
    2014 unreported determination, Dusane & Ors v SSHD  IA/08058/2014,  had
    implications for the Equinox cases as a whole. However, under a further
    sub-heading entitled "Consider each application" it was stated that the
    guidance given was merely intended to provide guidance  and  should  be
    augmented and developed for each case and that it  was  essential  that
    each application thoroughly developed  grounds  for  refusal  that  are
    specific to the case being considered.

12. In that light Mr Martin  highlighted  that  the  Respondent's  guidance
    itself revealed that the guidance and reliance upon  the  determination
    of Dusane alone, in of itself would not be enough to warrant a refusal.
    Indeed it appears that the unreported determination (which was not even
    produced by the Respondent before the First-tier Tribunal) was the sole
    basis upon which there would have been 'implications' for Equinox cases
    according to F3 of the Respondent's bundle.  Mr Martin also directed my
    attention to  Annex  G  of  the  Respondent's  bundle  which  contained
    abbreviated and unaudited accounts and an exemption from an audit which
    was accepted as valid at  F4  of  the  Respondent's  bundle,  and  also
    directed my attention to Annexes H and I which show  that,  taking  the
    Respondent's case at its  highest, there were individuals  involved  in
    Equinox Venture Capital whom were also involved  in  Profectus  -  that
    company being the subject of the reported determination  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Arshad & Ors (Tier 1 applicants - funding - "availability":
    Pakistan) [2016] UKUT 334 (IAC).

13. Indeed, having looked at the determination in Arshad it is  clear  that
    the determination only goes so far as to assess the  funding  available
    from  Profectus  Venture  Capital  which  is  the   trading   name   of
    Providential Capital ("Providentia").  As  such  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    findings at paragraphs 70 to 78  are  not  conclusive  in  relation  to
    whether  funding  was  available  from  Equinox  Venture  Capital   LLP
    ("Equinox"), not Providentia.  Indeed I note that there is  no  mention
    of Equinox anywhere in the reported decision of Arshad & Ors at all.

14. Thus, given the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, in my  view  I
    am only just persuaded that the decision  is  unsustainable  given  the
    paucity of evidence in the Respondent's bundle.

15. I make clear that I form no view as to the availability of  funds  from
    Equinox, and I observe that there  appears  to  be  material  which  is
    referred to in the refusal letter such as a  'statement'  in  September
    2013 of Providentia's CEO, Gulamabbas Lakha, whom  allegedly  confirmed
    to the Respondent in writing that Equinox was, at that time, committing
    a total of �1,400,000 across a large number of  businesses  set  up  by
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applicants.  If that is indeed so, then  that  is
    material which the Secretary of State ought to put  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal where  she  seeks  to  persuade  the  Tribunal  that  the
    position   of   Equinox   is    indistinguishable    from    that    of
    Providentia/Profectus.  There is a stark  contrast  that  can  be  seen
    between the quality and quantity  of  evidence  put  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Arshad & Ors and between that served by  the  Secretary  of
    State in this appeal.

16. Thus, although the Secretary of State's case is  premised  on  a  basis
    similar to that seen in Arshad & Ors, the evidence in my view  was  not
    of a similar quality as that put forward  in  that  reported  decision,
    such that the consideration by the First-tier  Tribunal  of  the  funds
    available from Equinox should naturally follow without  the  production
    of any further evidence other than the mutuality of senior  members  of
    both companies.  This observation is, of course, specific only  to  the
    instant appeal before me and the contents of  the  Respondent's  Bundle
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

17. In light of the above findings, I set aside the decision of findings of
    the First-tier Tribunal entirely.

Notice of Decision

18. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

19. The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law and is set aside.

20. The appeal is to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  by
    a differently constituted bench.

21. No anonymity direction is made.
