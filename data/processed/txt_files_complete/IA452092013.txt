Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss N Manyarara
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Sri Lankan citizen who was  born  on  12  May  1977.
    Solicitors applied on her behalf for leave to remain on  the  basis  of
    her continuing family and private life in the United  Kingdom  but  the
    application was refused by a decision dated 15 October 2013.

 2. The appellant appealed.  By a determination promulgated on 3 April 2014
    First-tier Tribunal Judge B Morris dismissed the appeal.  The appellant
    applied for permission to appeal that decision to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission to appeal was granted.  The judge doing so said that he  was
    satisfied that in reaching her decision  the  judge  arguably  made  an
    error of law by failing to engage fully with the appellant's  arguments
    concerning the application of the case of MM [2013] EWHC  1900  in  the
    consideration of Article 8.

 3. Counsel who was to have represented the appellant in the Upper Tribunal
    was unfortunately unable to do so. An adjournment request was  made  on
    the day before the hearing before me but that application was  refused.
    Miss Manyarara informed me that she had been briefed only very  shortly
    before the hearing.  She did not seek to renew the application  for  an
    adjournment but argued that there was a Robinson obvious point that had
    not been raised in the grounds seeking permission to  appeal  and  this
    placed her in a difficult position.

 4. Before deciding how to proceed I made enquiries of Miss Manyarara as to
    what point she felt had not been  taken  by  counsel  who  drafted  the
    grounds  seeking  permission.   Miss  Manyarara  explained   that   the
    appellant arrived here as a fianc�e and then made a timely  application
    in-country for leave to remain.  Miss Manyarara then  sought  to  argue
    that  an  in-country  variation   of   leave   application   in   these
    circumstances did not have to meet the financial  requirements  element
    of the Rules set out at E-LTRP.3.1., although  accepting  that  at  the
    time of the application for leave to enter the appellant needed  to  do
    so.

 5. This appeared to be a novel submission which was  unlikely  to  succeed
    and upon examination of the relevant sections of  Appendix  FM  to  the
    Rules I found to be without merit.

 6. The Reasons for Refusal Letter stated at one point:-

          "Although you meet the suitability  and  eligibility  requirements
         above we note that there are no insurmountable reasons why you  and
         your husband cannot continue your family life outside  the  UK  and
         therefore you have failed to meet EX.1 (b) and so  the  application
         is refused."(My emphasis).

 7. However, Appendix FM - R-LTRP (Requirements for limited leave to remain
    as a partner (which includes a fianc�e)) at 1.1. (c) (i)  sets out that
    the  applicant  must  not  fall  for  refusal  under   Section   S-LTR:
    (suitability -  leave to remain); and by (c) (ii)  the  applicant  must
    meet all of the requirements of Section E-LTRP.  E-LTRP.3.1.  specifies
    the  evidence  that  has  to  be  provided  to   meet   the   financial
    requirements. Thus as well as meeting all the other requirements of the
    rules for the appellant to succeed  she  would  also  have  to  provide
    evidence relating to sufficiency of income.

 8. The Reasons for Refusal Letter, as quoted in  paragraph  6,  above  may
    have led Miss Manyarara to raise the point that  she  did  because  the
    letter states that the appellant meets the suitability and  eligibility
    requirements of the  rule.  However,  as  Mr  Martin  appears  to  have
    recognised at the First-tier tribunal hearing, the appellant was unable
    to meet the financial requirements by relying on her  partner's  salary
    alone. The thrust of his argument was  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to the appellant and sponsor continuing family  life  outside
    the UK in Sri Lanka and insurmountable obstacles preventing the sponsor
    from travelling to Sri Lanka with his wife.   Compelling  circumstances
    that should have led to the appeal being allowed on Article  8  grounds
    included that the financial requirements of the Rules should be  viewed
    more broadly than in Appendix FM. However, the  judge  dealt  with  all
    these matters in a fully  and  thoroughly  reasoned  determination  and
    declined to carry out a full Article 8 analysis of  the  case  for  the
    reasons given in paragraph 30 of the determination.

 9. Counsel relied heavily in the grounds seeking permission on the case of
    MM [2013] EWHC 1900 and submitted that  if  the  appellant's  potential
    earnings were taken together with her husband's current  earnings  they
    would surpass the minimum figure required of �18,600 income per  annum.
    The submission proceeded  that  the  judge  completely  overlooked  the
    evidence of potential future earnings and  "given  a  reason  which  is
    wrong in fact for refusing to follow MM  as  a  reason  to  conduct  an
    Article 8 analysis"(sic).

10. It was submitted also that there is  nothing  in  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT
    00640 which states that where somebody can bring themselves within  the
    five features set out in paragraph 124 of MM that Article 8 should  not
    be assessed.

11. One of the five features said to justify  consideration  of  Article  8
    outside the Rules is the disregard (in the rules) of the  spouse's  own
    earning capacity during the 30 month period of initial entry.  Although
    the sponsor's earnings on their own could not meet either  the  �18,600
    figure in the Rules or the �13,400 figure identified by  the  Migration
    Advisory Committee the appellant herself had been offered work.   Those
    future earnings could not be considered under Appendix  FM  but  should
    have led to the judge conducting an  Article  8  analysis  outside  the
    Rules.  If the judge was satisfied that  the  couple  could  reach  the
    �18,600 figure or satisfied that the couple could  maintain  themselves
    without recourse to further public funds, just  as  they  had  for  the
    thirteen months since the appellant arrived in the UK, then the  appeal
    should have been allowed.

12. In the final submission counsel said that had an Article  8  assessment
    been carried out the important issue would  be  whether  the  appellant
    could remain here and not be a burden on  the  public  purse.   If  she
    could then her removal would be disproportionate.  Both because of  the
    appellant's future earnings and because the couple have  been  able  to
    live within their means even before the sponsor found work  the  couple
    would be able to support themselves.

13. The case of MM was heard in the Court of Appeal and  the  decision  was
    published after the First-tier judge's determination  was  promulgated.
    The neutral citation number is [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

14. The appellant draws support from the point made  in  MM  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal that individually, one or more of the  five  elements  of  the
    Rules  listed  at  124  did  not  do  anything  towards  achieving  the
    identified and legitimate aims of ensuring  as  far  as  possible  that
    sufficient income is available to the couple to avoid  them  living  on
    benefits and so were not rationally connected  with  the  overall  aim.
    That was particularly so in relation to  disregarding  the  appellant's
    own earning capacity during the 30 month period  after  initial  entry.
    However, this argument did not find favour in the Court of Appeal which
    concluded that the judge's analysis and conclusion that the new minimum
    maintenance  requirements  were,  in  principle,  incapable  of   being
    compatible with the Article 8 rights of UK  partners  was  not  correct
    (paragraphs 140 - 152).

15. The position therefore now appears to be that following  the  Court  of
    Appeal decision there is no strong  implication  that  if  someone  can
    bring themselves within the categories identified by Mr  Justice  Blake
    in the Upper Tribunal they  should  be  able  to  rely  on  Article  8.
    Counsel before the First-tier Judge in this appeal made the  submission
    that the appellant should be able to rely on  Article  8  and  this  is
    noted at paragraph 29 of the determination.  The judge dealt  with  the
    submissions made in paragraph 30 and concluded  in  that  paragraph  by
    stating  that  "the  other  matters  raised  by  Mr Martin  have  been
    considered in relation to the Rules under EX.1 and therefore I  do  not
    find that they may amount to arguably good grounds for  granting  leave
    to remain outside the Rules".  The judge then did not go on to consider
    whether there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules, this being the point  arising  from  the  decision  in
    Gulshan.

16. It is arguable that Gulshan may not be correct in  stating  that  after
    applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may  be  arguably
    good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them is it  necessary
    for Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
    compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under   them.
    Whatever is the correct position the judge in this appeal  undertook  a
    thorough analysis of the position of the  appellant  and  sponsor  such
    that if she erred in failing to undertake a separate Article 8 analysis
    it is abundantly clear that the appellant could not and would not  have
    succeeded under Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules in any  event.   There
    is nothing in the financial requirements  and  eligibility  point  that
    helps the appellant and the sponsor and if there were to be any further
    reconsideration of the appeal it would be bound to fail on the facts as
    found by the judge which findings were open to her.

Decision

17. As I announced at the hearing the  determination  reveals  no  material
    error of law and does not reveal  any  good  reason  why  the  decision
    should be set aside and reheard.

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge therefore stands.

19. I was not addressed on the matter of anonymity.  No direction was given
    in that regard in the First-tier and I see no reason on  the  facts  to
    make such a direction now.
