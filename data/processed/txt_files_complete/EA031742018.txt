                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr J Holt of Counsel instructed by Eric Smith Law

For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appeal of the appellant  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State refusing him a residence card confirming a right  to
    reside in the United Kingdom.

 2. As was identified by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Lindsley  when  she  gave
    permission, there is a fundamental problem in the  adverse  credibility
    finding.  There is no need  to  spell  it  out  in  great  detail;  the
    essential point is that the judge said,  wrongly,  that  there  was  no
    evidence that money was paid into an independent person's bank  account
    when there plainly was such evidence.  This has been explained in  some
    detail before me and Mrs Aboni, entirely sensibly, accepts the point is
    made out.  This means there is an adverse credibility  finding  for  an
    entirely unjustified reason and this means that the adverse credibility
    findings are unsafe.

 3. This is a case where credibility is important and therefore I  have  to
    say the error is material and I set aside the decision.

 4. Before me the parties agree that the proper remedy is that the case  be
    reheard in the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. This is not a case where there are findings to say if this  is  a  case
    where the case has to be heard again and  I  therefore  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

    Notice of Decision

 6. I find there has been an error of law and I direct  that  the  case  be
    heard again in the First-tier Tribunal in Birmingham.
