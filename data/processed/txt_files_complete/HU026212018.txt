                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against the decision of the Secretary of State to
    deport him and to refuse his human rights claim made on 9 January 2018.
     His appeal against  that  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    allowed in a decision promulgated on 9 April 2019.  That  decision  was
    set aside by the Upper Tribunal for the reasons set out in the decision
    promulgated on 26 June 2019, a copy of which is annexed.

 2. The appellant was born on  12  August  1982.   He  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on  14  October  2001,  claiming  asylum  on  2  January  2002.
    Although initially refused, his application was  successful  on  appeal
    and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2003.  He has had several
    convictions since then.  In 2010 he was sentenced to  thirteen  months'
    imprisonment which resulted in the  Secretary  of  State  revoking  his
    refugee status in 2011 and in 2012 signing a deportation order  against
    him.  The deportation order was  revoked  in  2013,  a  fresh  decision
    issued and his appeal against that decision was allowed  on  Article  8
    grounds in 2014.  After initially  seeking  to  resist  the  subsequent
    revocation of his indefinite leave to remain, eventually the  appellant
    accepted leave to remain on a limited basis.

 3. In 2015 the appellant was sentenced as a  result  of  further  criminal
    offences and again on 8 May 2017 was convicted in his alias, Aria Nami,
    of passing as genuine a  thing  knowing  it  was  a  counterfeit  of  a
    currency  note  to  which  he  was  sentenced   to   fourteen   months'
    imprisonment.

 4. The Secretary of State then began  the  deportation  process  anew.   A
    further deportation order was made on 29 December 2017,  the  Secretary
    of State refusing to revoke that and it is against that  decision  that
    the appellant has an appeal on human rights grounds.

 5. The appellant's wife is originally an  Iranian  national  but  has  now
    naturalised as a British citizen.  The couple have three children  born
    in 2013, 2015 and late 2017.   All  three  are  British  citizens.   In
    addition, the appellant's mother lives in the United  Kingdom  and  his
    wife has a number of other relatives in the United  Kingdom,  including
    his sister and mother.

 6. The Secretary of State's case is that, in summary,  although  it  would
    be unduly harsh for the children to live in Iran  as  his  wife  cannot
    live there given that she had been  recognised  as  a  refugee  in  the
    United Kingdom, it would not be unduly harsh for the children to remain
    in the United Kingdom with their mother.  Accordingly, it was concluded
    that the appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraph 399(a) of
    the Immigration  Rules;  it  was  not  accepted  that  the  appellant's
    relationship with his wife was such that he  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 399(b) of the Immigration Rules on the basis,  amongst  other
    reasons, that the relationship was not formed  in  the  United  Kingdom
    when he was in the country lawfully and his immigration status was  not
    precarious given he had obtained refugee status by deception and sought
    to enter the United Kingdom by applying for a visa in another  identity
    and, had travelled to Dubai to marry, having  failed  to  surrender  to
    custody in the United Kingdom nor was it accepted it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for her to remain in the United Kingdom if he were deported.

 7. The respondent considered also that there were not in  this  case  very
    compelling circumstances such that he should not be deported.

 8. On appeal, the judge found that the  wife  could  not  return  to  Iran
    because of her father's profile as a Mujahedin activist  and  that  the
    youngest child  had  some  difficulties  showing  hearing,  speech  and
    language development issues [18].  The judge found it would  be  unduly
    harsh on the three children and his wife if the appellant  were  to  be
    deported as they could not visit him in Iran.

 9. For the reasons set out in the attached  error  of  law  decision,  the
    Upper Tribunal concluded that the decision to that effect involved  the
    making of an error of law and we set it aside to be remade.



The Hearing on 13 August 2019

10. The appellant represented himself.  He gave evidence as did  his  wife,
    his wife's sister, and his mother-in-law.   In  addition  to  the  oral
    evidence, I had before me a report from an  independent  social  worker
    and her CV, a bundle of witness statements and case law produced by the
    respondent.

11. The appellant adopted his witness  statements  adding  and  was  cross-
    examined.  He said that his youngest child's hearing  difficulties  had
    not yet been formally assessed given his age  but  he  has  been  given
    hearing aids and goes to speech therapy sessions.  He is also monitored
    at nursery school.  The doctors had said that the hearing aids do  help
    him hear better but that it is difficult to assess it properly until he
    is able to start talking better.

12. The appellant said that neither his mother-in-law nor his  sister  were
    able to help look after the children.  He said that  his  mother-in-law
    suffers from back pain and other problems.  He said  that  she  was  in
    receipt of benefits, was not sure which, but that she has a blue  badge
    owing to reduced mobility.

13. The appellant said that his wife gets housing benefit,  child  and  tax
    allowance but in addition to that they had had  to  borrow  money  from
    friends.

14. In response to my questions, the appellant said that the  rent  on  the
    house was about �2,000 a month, approximately �11,400 of which was  met
    by housing benefit and that they received other benefits  on  top.   He
    said he was not sure if he would be able to keep in contact with family
    from Iran using means such as Facebook or WhatsApp or other means as he
    understood that the Iranian regime tries to limit contact on using such
    methods.

15. I then heard evidence from the appellant's wife who adopted her witness
    statement adding that her parents live about seven to eight miles away.
     And was cross-examined.  She said that her  mother,  who  lives  about
    seven to eight miles away, has back and hand problems.  She  said  that
    she is on medication, cannot drive, bend or use her hands without pain.
     She did not show the nature of the problem.

16. The appellant's wife said that her youngest son does have hearing  aids
    and that these appear to work.  She said that he ought to have 50 to 60
    words in his vocabulary by now but only has 15 to  20.   She  said  the
    family struggles financially and this would be worse if  the  appellant
    were deported as she would have to give up her work as  a  carer  which
    adds �60 to �70 a week to the benefits and  they  would  probably  lose
    their house.  She said that she is in contact with her sister but  that
    as their children do not get on, this is relatively limited.

17. I then heard evidence from the appellant's  sister-in-law  (his  wife's
    sister).  She adopted her witness  statement  and  was  cross-examined.
    She said that she saw her sister about once a month as the children  do
    not get on but speak regularly by phone.  She said that she  cares  for
    her mother-in-law who has problems with her shoulders  which  had  just
    been replaced as well as  her  knee.   She  works  part-time  and  also
    volunteers with the church.

18. I heard evidence from the appellant's  mother-in-law  who  adopted  her
    witness statement.  She  said  that  she  suffers  from  migraines  and
    dizziness for which she takes tablets.  She also said that she receives
    benefits owing to her disability but she was not quite sure which  ones
    as her husband dealt with that.

19. Mr Tufan submitted that there were two issues to be considered: whether
    it would be unduly harsh to separate the children from their father  by
    deporting him; and, whether there are very compelling reasons over  and
    above those set out in Exceptions 1 and 2 as set out in Section 117C of
    the 2002 Act.  He submitted that the answer to both  questions  was  no
    given that the threshold to show undue  harshness  was  very  high  and
    whilst it was evident that the family would face difficulties and would
    even face distress, that was not sufficient as could be  seen  from  PG
    (Jamaica) at paragraphs 34, 38 and 39.  He submitted  that  the  report
    from the social worker did little more beyond considering that it would
    be in the best interests of the children for  them  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He accepted that that may  be  so  but  that  did  not
    dispose of the matter given that an actual fact of deportation  was  to
    separate families.  He submitted that there was  insufficient  evidence
    to show that the youngest child  would  face  positions  of  sufficient
    severity to bring the appellant over the threshold of undue  harshness,
    relying on BL at paragraph 53.  He submitted in any  event  were  there
    problems with this family and lack of family support, it had  not  been
    shown that social services would be unable to assist.

20. Mr Tufan submitted that there was simply nothing of a  very  compelling
    nature in the facts of this case.

21. In response, the appellant said that he had  appreciated  he  had  made
    mistakes, realised that he has psychological problems and he was trying
    to remedy that.  He submitted it would be very difficult for his family
    as he needed to work and help them clear debts.   He  said  his  family
    would be forced to  leave  their  house  and  that  it  would  be  very
    difficult for his wife to look after the son  and  the  other  children
    given that the youngest son needs a lot of other  assistance  with  his
    speech therapy and being taken to and from appointments which could not
    be managed whilst dealing with the other two children.  He said he  had
    nowhere to go on return to Iran and no job or a place to live.



The Law

22. Section 117C provides as follows:-


         "117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving
         foreign criminals

          1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
             interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
             the greater is the public interest in deportation of the
             criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
                  most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                  Kingdom, and

             (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
                  deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
             relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
             period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1
             and 2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
             into account where a court or tribunal is considering a
             decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that
             the reason for the decision was the offence or offences for
             which the criminal has been convicted."

23. The Immigration Rules provide:

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies
         if -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
         with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

             (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

             (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least
             the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the immigration
             decision; and in either case

                  (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                  country to which the person is to be deported; and

                  (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in
                  the UK without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in the
         UK, and

             (i)  the relationship was formed at a time when the person
             (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status
             was not precarious; and

             (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in the
             country to which the person is to be deported, because of
             compelling circumstances over and above those described in
             paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

             (iii)    it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain
             in the UK without the person who is to be deported.

24. In KO (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2018]  UKSC  53  the  Supreme  Court  held  at
    paragraph 23:-

         "23. On the other hand the expression "unduly harsh" seems  clearly
         intended to introduce a higher hurdle than that of "reasonableness"
         under section 117B(6), taking account of the public interest in the
         deportation of foreign criminals. Further the word "unduly" implies
         an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a "due" level of
         "harshness", that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable
         in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies  something  going  beyond
         that level. The relevant context is that set  by  section  117C(1),
         that  is  the  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of   foreign
         criminals. One is looking for a degree of  harshness  going  beyond
         what would necessarily be involved for any  child  faced  with  the
         deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my  view  (and
         subject to the discussion of the cases in the next  section)  is  a
         balancing of relative levels of severity of the  parent's  offence,
         other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn  by  the  section
         itself by reference to length of sentence.  Nor  (contrary  to  the
         view of the Court of Appeal in IT (Jamaica) v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ  932,  [2017]  1  WLR  240,
         paras 55, 64) can it be equated with a requirement  to  show  "very
         compelling reasons". That would  be  in  effect  to  replicate  the
         additional  test  applied  by  section  117C(6)  with  respect   to
         sentences of four years or more."

    In addition, at [27] the Supreme Court  approved  guidance  as  to  the
    meaning of unduly harsh given in MK (Sierra Leone) v SSHD  [2015]  UKUT
    223 saying this:-

         "27. Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of "unduly harsh"  in
         this context was given by the Upper Tribunal (McCloskey J President
         and UT Judge Perkins) in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for
         the Home Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC), [2015]  INLR  563,  para
         46, a decision given  on  15  April  2015.  They  referred  to  the
         "evaluative assessment" required of the tribunal:

             "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly  harsh'
             does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient,  undesirable
             or merely difficult. Rather,  it  poses  a  considerably  more
             elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this context, denotes something
             severe,  or  bleak.  It  is  the  antithesis  of  pleasant  or
             comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb  'unduly'
             raises an already elevated standard still higher."

         On the facts of that particular case, the Upper Tribunal held  that
         the test was satisfied:

             "Approached in this way, we have no hesitation  in  concluding
             that it would be unduly harsh for either of the two seven year
             old British citizen children concerned to be abruptly uprooted
             from their United  Kingdom  life  setting  and  lifestyle  and
             exiled to this struggling, impoverished  and  plague  stricken
             west African state. No reasonable  or  right  thinking  person
             would consider this anything less that cruel."

         This view was based simply on the wording of  the  subsection,  and
         did not apparently depend on any view of the relative  severity  of
         the particular offence. I do not understand the conclusion  on  the
         facts of that case to be controversial."

25. Commenting on KO (Nigeria), the Upper Tribunal in RA (Iraq) said this:-

         "(1) In KO (Nigeria) & Others v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2018] UKSC 53, the approval by the Supreme Court of the
         test of "unduly harsh"  in  section  117C(5)  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, formulated by the  Upper  Tribunal
         in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
         [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC), does not mean that the test includes the way
         in which the Upper Tribunal applied its formulation to the facts of
         the case before it.

         (2)  The way in which a court or tribunal should  approach  section
         117C remains as set out  in  the  judgment  of  Jackson  LJ  in  NA
         (Pakistan) & Another v Secretary of State [2016] EWCA Civ 662.

         (3)   Section  117C(6)  applies  to  both  categories  of   foreign
         criminals  described  by  Lord  Carnwath  in  paragraph  20  of  KO
         (Nigeria);  namely,  those  who  have   not   been   sentenced   to
         imprisonment of 4 years or more, and those  who  have.  Determining
         the seriousness of the  particular  offence  will  normally  be  by
         reference to the length of sentence imposed and what the sentencing
         judge had to say about seriousness and mitigation; but the ultimate
         decision is for the court  or  tribunal  deciding  the  deportation
         case.

         (4)  Rehabilitation will not ordinarily  bear  material  weight  in
         favour of a foreign criminal."

26. It is also evident from the decision of the Upper Tribunal in that case
    that if Exception 1 or 2 is not met, then it would be necessary  to  go
    on  to  consider  whether  there  are   nonetheless   very   compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

27. In SSHD v PG (Jamaica)  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1213  the  Court  of  Appeal
    described the issue as this:-

         "38. The decision in KO (Nigeria) requires this court to  adopt  an
         approach which differs from that taken by Judge Griffith and  Judge
         Finch. In the circumstances of this  appeal,  I  do  not  think  it
         necessary to refer to decisions predating KO (Nigeria), because  it
         is no longer appropriate, when considering section 117C(5)  of  the
         2002 Act, to balance the severity of the consequences for  SAT  and
         the children of PG's deportation against  the  seriousness  of  his
         offending. The issue is whether there was evidence on which it  was
         properly open to Judge Griffith to  find  that  deportation  of  PG
         would result for SAT and/or the children in a degree  of  harshness
         going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any partner  or
         child of a foreign criminal facing deportation.

         39.  Formulating the issue in that way, there is in  my  view  only
         one answer to  the  question.  I  recognise  of  course  the  human
         realities of the situation, and I do not doubt  that  SAT  and  the
         three children will suffer great distress if PG is deported. Nor do
         I doubt that their lives will in a number  of  ways  be  made  more
         difficult than they are at  present.  But  those,  sadly,  are  the
         likely consequences of the deportation of any foreign criminal  who
         has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a  partner  and/or
         children in this country. I accept Mr Lewis's submission that if PG
         is deported, the effect on SAT and/or their three children will not
         go beyond the degree of harshness which is necessarily involved for
         the partner or child of a foreign criminal who is deported. That is
         so, notwithstanding that  the  passage  of  time  has  provided  an
         opportunity for the family ties between PG,  SAT  and  their  three
         children to become stronger than they were  at  an  earlier  stage.
         Although no detail was provided to this court of the  circumstances
         of what I have referred to as the knife incident,  there  seems  no
         reason to doubt that it was both a comfort and an advantage for SAT
         and the children,  in  particular  R,  that  PG  was  available  to
         intervene when his son was a victim of  crime.  I  agree,  however,
         with Mr Lewis's submission that the knife incident, serious  though
         it may have been, cannot of itself  elevate  this  case  above  the
         norm.  Many  parents  of  teenage  children  are  confronted   with
         difficulties and upsetting events of one sort or another, and  have
         to face one or more of their children going  through  "a  difficult
         period" for one reason or another, and the fact that a  parent  who
         is a foreign criminal will no longer be in a position to assist  in
         such circumstances cannot of itself mean that the  effects  of  his
         deportation are unduly harsh for his partner and/or  children.  Nor
         can the difficulties which SAT will inevitably face,  increased  as
         they are by her laudable ongoing efforts to further  her  education
         and so to improve her earning capacity, elevate the case above  the
         commonplace so far as the effects of PG's deportation  on  her  are
         concerned. In this  regard,  I  think  it  significant  that  Judge
         Griffith at paragraph 67 of her judgment referred to the "emotional
         and behavioural fallout" with which  SAT  would  have  to  deal:  a
         phrase which, to my mind, accurately summarises the effect  on  SAT
         of PG's deportation, but at the same time reflects its  commonplace
         nature."

28.  In assessing the impact on the family I have regard to what  was  said
    in BL (Jamaica) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 357 at [53]:

         "53. What the UT did in the course of their detailed and  no  doubt
             conscientious decision was to accept KS's son's evidence  that
             KS could not manage her money and drank more that was good for
             her and made the inference that without BL  the  family  would
             descend  into  poverty  and  require  the  support  of  social
             services. As against this, however, KS had  looked  after  the
             family while BL was in prison or immigration detention and the
             UT had  not  made  any  findings  that  the  family  had  then
             descended into poverty  or  required  the  support  of  social
             services, or that if that were to happen, there would  not  be
             adequate support services for  these  children.  The  UT  were
             entitled to work on the basis that the social  services  would
             perform their duties  under  the  law  and,  contrary  to  the
             submission  of  Mr  Rudd,  the  UT  was  not  bound  in  these
             circumstances to regard the role of  the  social  services  as
             irrelevant. The Secretary of State had made the point  in  the
             decision letter that there was no satisfactory  evidence  that
             KS had not  coped  with  the  children's  upbringing  in  BL's
             absence and so the UT were aware that this point was in issue.
             KS's son's evidence was an insufficient evidential  basis  for
             the UT's conclusion on this point. His evidence was in reality
             uncorroborated and self-serving hearsay on this issue."

29. I accept, and it is not  in  dispute,  that  there  is  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship between  the  appellant  and  his  wife  and  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship between them  and  their  children.
    It is accepted that it would be unduly harsh to expect the children  to
    go to live in Iran and I accept also that it would be unduly  harsh  to
    expect the appellant's wife to  go  to  live  there  in  light  of  the
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal.  That  said,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not appear to have addressed the first and second limbs of
    paragraph 399(b) nor has any Rule 24 letter been produced  and  in  the
    circumstances, I conclude that this would not  apply  for  the  reasons
    given by the Secretary of State: although the appellant  did  establish
    his family life with his wife whilst he had indefinite leave to  remain
    his position had been precarious given his criminal record and the fact
    that he had absconded from the United Kingdom to avoid trial.

30. The focus therefore must first be on whether separating the appellant's
    wife and their children from the appellant by deporting  him  would  be
    unduly harsh on the children.

31. I have no reason to doubt the account of  the  difficulties  of  family
    life that would exist were the appellant to be deported.  I accept that
    it would be difficult if not impossible for  the  appellant's  wife  to
    continue working in the limited hours she has if she had to look  after
    the children without the support of a partner.  I accept that this  may
    also mean that it would be difficult for them  to  continue  living  in
    their current house but what I have not heard is evidence that the rest
    of the family would not be able to assist, even if only temporarily, in
    providing finance to the family to make up the shortfall.

32. I have no reason to doubt either the account given for the family  life
    by the social worker.  It is perhaps inevitable that the children  were
    distressed when their  father  was  imprisoned  and  that  this  caused
    behavioural difficulties.  I have no doubt that these would reoccur  if
    the appellant is deported but  again  that  sort  of  distress  is  the
    natural consequence of deportation.  I am satisfied that it is  in  the
    children's best interests, as  the  social  worker  argues,  for  their
    father to remain with them and for them to be brought up as part  of  a
    nuclear family.  But, as Mr Tufan submitted, that is not dispositive of
    the issue; it is necessary for the effect on the children to be  unduly
    harsh.

33. It may well be that the appellant will have difficulty  in  maintaining
    contact with his family by electronic means.  He was unsure about  this
    but I take judicial note of country  guidance  cases  produced  by  the
    Upper Tribunal to show that there is interference in communications put
    in place by the government of Iran.  Whether or not that  would  impact
    on his ability to maintain, for example, internet video  communications
    with his family is unclear although I accept that it is not  likely  to
    be as certain as making such communications from a country without such
    restrictions in place.

34. I accept also that there would be real difficulties  in  the  appellant
    and his family meeting in a third country given the cost and  the  lack
    of funds currently available.

35. With regard to the situation for the younger child, I accept  from  the
    medical and oral evidence that he does have to wear  hearing  aids.   I
    accept also that his speech and language development has  been  delayed
    as a result of the hearing  problem  which,  as  the  appellant's  wife
    explained to me, was detected shortly after birth.  It is not, however,
    at this stage clear whether the  child  would  be  able  in  future  to
    communicate  with  hearing  aids  or  whether  he  would  be  able   to
    communicate by audio-visual means with his father.  In any event, given
    his young age and presence, that would be extremely difficult.

36. I accept the evidence that the appellant's and his wife's family  would
    not be able to assist at least in practical terms although they may  be
    able to provide some degree of moral support.   Nonetheless,  there  is
    insufficient evidence to show that at this stage there is any realistic
    prospect of there  being  such  serious  problems  as  to  require  the
    intervention of social services.

37. Taking all of these factors into account, while I have no hesitation in
    concluding  that  the  deportation  of  the  appellant  will   have   a
    significant and serious effect on his wife and their children, applying
    the case law set out above I am not satisfied that this meets the  high
    threshold required to show that it would be unduly  harsh.  It  is  not
    enough to be characterised  as  severe  or  bleak.   In  reaching  that
    conclusion I take into account the fact that the appellant is primarily
    responsible for looking after the children during the daytime when  the
    mother is sleeping and also in taking the youngest child  to  and  from
    appointments.

38. Having found that the appellant does not meet the requirements set  out
    in Exception 1 or Exception 2, it is  therefore  necessary  for  me  to
    consider whether there are nonetheless  very  compelling  circumstances
    such that deportation would not be proportionate.

39. I bear in mind that there is a very real prospect of family life  being
    severed permanently in this case or at the very least for a significant
    number of years.  While I accept  that  the  wife  does  not  meet  the
    requirements set out in 399(b), nonetheless I accept that she would  be
    so effectively separated from her husband and  he  would  be  separated
    from the extended family that he has in  the  United  Kingdom  both  in
    terms of his own blood relatives and his wife's relatives.  I  am  not,
    however, persuaded by the evidence that the situation in Iran would  be
    so bleak for him and his evidence he would not be able to have anywhere
    to live or to find a job is speculative.  Viewing all the  evidence  in
    the round, I am not satisfied that there is anything in  this  material
    such that the very compelling circumstances is met and in reaching that
    conclusion I bear in mind the  appellant's  long  history  of  criminal
    offending and the use of false names.

40. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that deporting the appellant would be a
    breach of his Article 8 rights or otherwise and I therefore dismiss the
    appeal.


Notice of Decision

 1) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.


 2) I remake the appeal by dismissing the appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms H Arrif, Arden Solicitors Advocates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

41. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge S J Clarke promulgated on 9 April 2019
    allowing Mr Farvahari's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of
    State to deport him and to refuse his human rights claim, that decision
    being made on 9 January 2018.

42. The appellant in this case is the Secretary of State but for ease we
    refer to Mr Farvahari as the appellant as he was in the First-tier
    Tribunal.

43. The appellant was previously successful in an appeal against an earlier
    a deportation order, as is set out in the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal against which this appeal lies at paragraphs [10] to [17].
    The appellant is a citizen of Iran.  His wife and his three children
    are British citizens.  One of the children has a number of difficulties
    both in terms of hearing, speech and language development issues.

44. The judge in this case concluded, having directed herself in line with
    KO (Nigeria) at paragraph 19, that it would be unduly harsh on the
    three children and the wife if the appellant were to be deported as
    they could not visit him in Iran because there was no nobody that could
    take them to see him.  The judge also found earlier in her decision
    that the wife, although a British citizen, could not travel to Iran
    because of her political activities, which were continuing.

45. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal in this case on the
    relatively narrow ground that the judge had failed to give reasons as
    to how the high threshold of unduly harsh consequences is met in this
    case, the fact that family life would be permanently fragmented not
    being sufficient and that the test of unreasonableness is a lower
    threshold than that required of unduly harsh consequences.

46. We heard submissions from both representatives.  We accept the
    submission that unduly harsh is a high test; it is difficult to meet
    and what amounts to unduly harshness is set out to some degree in
    paragraph [27] of KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC53.  It has, in summary, to
    be something bleak and/or severe.  We bear in mind also what was said
    in NA (Pakistan) & Another v Secretary of State [2016] EWCA Civ 662. at
    paragraph [34], that neither the British nationality of the
    respondent's children nor their likely separation from their father for
    a long time are exceptional circumstances.  That approach is endorsed
    in RA (s.117C: "unduly harsh"; offence: seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT
    123 (IAC).

47. Despite Ms Arrif's best efforts on behalf of her client we do not
    accept that in this case the judge had properly set out why the
    consequences on the family were unduly harsh.  It is the clear policy
    of Parliament, as set out in Section 117C, to split up families.  That
    is the purpose of the legislation.  The default position is that
    families will be split by deportation.  The judge has, in our view,
    failed to set out anything or make any findings of fact such as would
    show that the consequences for the wife and the children of deporting
    the appellant would be unduly harsh, even though we accept that there
    are three British citizen children involved .

48. There is, with respect to the judge, nothing identified which takes
    this out of the usual consequences on a family of deportation and for
    these reasons, we find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did
    involve the making of an error of law and we set it aside to be remade.

49. We do not consider that it would be appropriate for this case to be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  We consider that it should be
    retained in the Upper Tribunal but adjourned to another date to permit
    the further evidence to be served.


Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and we set it aside.

50. The appeal will be remade in the Upper Tribunal on a date to be fixed.

51. Any additional material or evidence upon which either party may seek to
    rely must be served at least 10 working days before the next hearing.
    Any failure to comply with this may result in the material or evidence
    being excluded.
