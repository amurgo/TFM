For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani (for Duncan Lewis Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow (Senior Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of QK, a citizen of Afghanistan  born  [  ]  1984,
       against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  of  dismissing  his
       appeal against the refusal of his asylum claim of 30 September  2015.
       Although I do not believe an anonymity order has so far been made  on
       his appeal, it is plainly appropriate to do so, given that his  claim
       involves an allegation that his activities online have  come  to  the
       attention of his antagonists in Afghanistan  and  as  he  has  family
       remaining in the country, for which reason I have anonymised all  the
       names of persons involved in the proceedings, save for the well-known
       figure of Masood.


    2. The Appellant entered the UK on 5 October 2011 as a  Tier  4  student
       with entry clearance conferring  leave  until  28  January  2013.  He
       applied for further leave to remain before that  leave  expired,  and
       that application was refused on 21 February 2013; the ensuing  appeal
       was dismissed. He was encountered by the immigration  service  during
       enforcement activity on 26  August  2013  and  served  notice  as  an
       overstayer, and detained. He made further efforts to  appeal  to  the
       First-tier Tribunal, and that application was refused on 16 September
       2013. An application to the Upper Tribunal failed and he was recorded
       as appeal rights exhausted  in  October  2013.  He  was  served  with
       removal directions for 25 November 2013,  and  detained  once  again,
       eventually being removed on 17 February 2014. The flight  was  unable
       to land in Kabul, however, and he was returned to  the  UK,  claiming
       asylum on 25 February 2014.


    3. He came from the village in Shakardara District, Kabul province.  His
       asylum claim was summarised in  the  refusal  letter  thus.  A  Tajik
       leader called Masood had given his  father,  a  Pashtun,  weapons  to
       store in his house. He understood that his  father  had  subsequently
       sold the weapons, so that when the Taliban, who came to know of their
       existence, subsequently searched the  village  for  the  cache,  they
       discovered they were missing, and demanded that the  arms,  or  their
       monetary value, be provided to them. His father and the  family  fled
       to Pakistan. His father returned to  Afghanistan  for  his  brother's
       funeral, and was captured  by  Masood's  men,  who  killed  him.  The
       Appellant's brother estimated that this took place in 1999.


    4. In 2003, the Appellant and his family  returned  to  Afghanistan,  as
       they could no longer afford to live in  Pakistan.  They  returned  to
       live in Kabul. They were arrested at his uncle's home by the security
       forces. The Appellant was detained and tortured,  for  two  or  three
       weeks. His mother bribed someone to  secure  their  release.  He  was
       subsequently arrested and detained for around two months a few  years
       later, and was again tortured, and once again his mother procured his
       release by bribery.  The  harassment  from  Masood's  men  continued,
       notwithstanding that he relocated to Baghlan province. In April  2009
       Masood's men located him once again and demanded that  he  return  to
       his home village. His brother was attacked in Kabul in 2015. He  made
       arrangements to depart the country, and feared a severe punishment if
       he returned there.


    5. The Secretary of State rejected his asylum claim, on the  basis  that
       the account was vague and speculative. In any event, the  authorities
       could be expected to provide sufficient protection and  alternatively
       he  could  find  safety  in  Kabul  where  conditions  would  not  be
       unreasonable.


    6. An expert report from Dr Ough for the Helen Bamber Foundation set out
       his opinion that the Appellant's knee problems were  consistent  with
       his account of being forced to carry heavy logs during the period  of
       his first kidnap (though a minor back strain caused for other reasons
       might  also  have  been  responsible);  and  that  his  psychological
       presentation  merited recognition as Post Traumatic  Stress  Disorder
       applying the international measure ICD10 given his  state  of  hyper-
       arousal, the onset and persistence of his symptoms,  the  history  he
       gave as to exposure to relevant stressors, his avoidance of  reminder
       stimuli, and his degree of emotional numbing. The  doctor  considered
       that the memory loss he would have experienced  given  these  factors
       accounted for any discrepancies in his account. He needed to be in an
       environment he perceived as safe in order to have reasonable recovery
       prospects. He would experience increased  fear  and  worsening  PTSD,
       anxiety and depression were he to be returned to Afghanistan. He  had
       considered whether the Appellant might  have  been  exaggerating  his
       symptoms but considered that unlikely  given  the  way  he  gave  his
       account.


    7. An expert country report  from  Ms  Emily  Winterbotham,  a  Research
       fellow at the Royal United Services  Institute,  who  had  lived  and
       worked in Afghanistan from  2009  to  2015  for  the  Office  of  the
       European Union Special Representative and  the  Afghanistan  Research
       and Evaluation Unit, set out that she had a range of contacts in  the
       Appellant's home District. The torture and  abuse  he  described  was
       wholly in keeping with the behaviour of Masood's commanders.  It  was
       possible that the Appellant would now be caught in a blood feud given
       his father's disposal of the weapons even though he had been young at
       the time of the original incident and notwithstanding  that  Masood's
       men were Tajik rather than Pashtun. He would  be  at  risk  of  being
       identified if he sought protection from  the  authorities  for  legal
       advice, or if he sought employment, given the system  of  checking  a
       person's history via a chain of enquiries going back  to  their  home
       area. He might be in danger in Kabul given the possibility  of  being
       informed upon there via the network of  operatives  loyal  to  former
       Northern Alliance commanders such as Masood;  his  brother  had  been
       identified in Kabul, on his account.


    8. In a short addendum report Ms Winterbotham commented on three further
       elements of the Appellant's claim. The  newspaper  article  regarding
       the attack on his brother came from  a  publication,  OQAB,  she  was
       familiar with, and she believed it reliable; it stated that  RD,  son
       of SM, had been seriously injured in the head and face but managed to
       escape alive, consistent with the Appellant's account. Turning to the
       video and the threatening  messages  attached  to  the  posting,  she
       stated that extremist groups in Afghanistan closely monitored  social
       media and other sources. Two of the messages appeared to  be  written
       by persons familiar with the Appellant and his history.


    9. The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence  from  the  Appellant  at  his
       appeal hearing which it recorded in detail alongside a summary of the
       Appellant's witness statements. It also noted evidence  that  he  had
       posted a video on his Facebook page of a  demonstration  outside  the
       Pakistan Embassy, and a transcript of the interview he had  given  in
       which he complained about  the  Taliban  being  the  worst  enemy  of
       Afghanistan and that Daesh were the "Military of Pakistan".


   10. The Appellant's brother HU gave evidence and described  the  family's
       farm, and the background to his father's  storage  of  weapons  which
       included armaments powerful enough to shoot down aircraft. After  his
       father had  returned  to  Afghanistan,  their  brother  WU  had  been
       detained and beaten by Masood's men. The people they had feared  were
       now part of the government themselves. The Appellant's uncle SA  gave
       evidence, saying he had heard about his brother-in-law being  killed,
       from his own sister, who had herself died some years earlier.


   11. Other witness statements were provided from non-attending  witnesses:
       the Appellant's brother WU, who said he was present when Masood's men
       first came to the family home. RD stated  he  was  attacked  in  Kote
       Char, Kabul, near a police station, and he required several stitches.
       He was now living in a refugee camp in Germany.


   12. AJT, a military intelligence operative with British  citizenship  who
       had worked in Afghanistan as an advisor  and  interpreter  for  a  UK
       company training and monitoring Afghan intelligence officers, said he
       had heard of the Appellant's problems  including  the  death  of  his
       father over the weapons'  disappearance  and  he  believed  that  the
       Taliban had made the comments on the Appellant's Facebook  page:  the
       Pakistan ISI, to his mind, were also effectively Taliban. He believed
       the Taliban could find someone and strike against  them  anywhere  in
       Afghanistan, having been threatened himself as a  political  activist
       and requiring a bodyguard whenever he returned to the country.


   13. Determining the appeal, the First-tier Tribunal noted the Appellant's
       very late asylum claim, and the  inconsistent  reasons  that  he  had
       given for it. He said that he had originally remained in the UK as  a
       student, which was a safer and more predictable way of staying in the
       UK  legally  than  pursuing  asylum,  and  then  when  his  extension
       application was refused, his solicitors had told him  that  providing
       further evidence by way of a missing bank  statement  would  fix  the
       problem; however he believed they had sent the wrong evidence, and he
       shortly faced removal from this country. He had been advised that  he
       would not be removed from the  UK,  and  it  was  only  when  he  was
       actually boarding the flight to Afghanistan that he tried to  tell  a
       security guard  about  his  wish  to  claim  asylum.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal found that his delay  in  claiming  asylum  counted  heavily
       against his credibility, bearing in mind the statutory  enjoinder  to
       look at this issue with care.


   14. The First-tier Tribunal noted  discrepancies  and  vagueness  in  his
       accounts of the background to his father's storage of any  particular
       kind  of  weaponry,  which  were  of  concern   notwithstanding   the
       Appellant's age. None of the witnesses were able to explain  who  had
       killed the Appellant's father or why.


   15. The various abductions suffered by the Appellant were  not  shown  to
       have been linked  to  his  father's  disposal  of  the  weaponry.  He
       accepted the Appellant's father had died, but not the account of  how
       it happened. It was possible that  the  abductions  had  taken  place
       given the medical evidence of the Appellant's ill treatment,  but  he
       found that the Appellant had not been truthful as to the identity  of
       the abductors. On the lower standard of proof if was more likely that
       the apparent wealth of the family and its ability to raise money were
       the true motivation for the abductions and  extortion  that  procured
       the Appellant's release.


   16. There was no documentary evidence of the grant of asylum to HU or WU,
       or of the reasons on which they might have been  granted  asylum.  He
       accepted the attack on RD had taken place, but it was by unidentified
       people; no motive was clear, and it  was  of  interest  that  it  was
       reported in a newspaper run by Tajik Extremists, which seemed odd  if
       Masood's group were known to be responsible.


   17. The Judge gave significant weight to the Winterbotham  report,  given
       her direct experience of the Appellant's home area, though  he  noted
       that she had taken the Appellant's account at face value when  making
       her report. The First-tier Tribunal did not consider that the  events
       at the Pakistan Embassy could put the Appellant  at  risk:  the  only
       risk of harm he claimed to face arose from  Masood's  supporters  and
       for them to have come across this article, they would  have  searched
       for the Appellant by name, and besides, given it recorded  a  protest
       against Pakistan, it was not obvious that they would ever come across
       it; anyway, Masood was opposed to the Taliban.


   18.  Overall,  these  considerations,  taken  with  the  claim's  extreme
       lateness, undermined his account. Risks could diminish over time  and
       it was possible that this was why he had waited  so  long  after  the
       last abduction before making  an  asylum  claim.  There  was  nothing
       before the Tribunal to indicate the Facebook threats were  linked  to
       Masood. The Appellant would  not  be  at  risk  of  serious  harm  in
       Afghanistan, and he had given only  a  vague  account  of  harassment
       during his final years there; he would be safe in Kabul or elsewhere.




   19. Grounds of appeal argued that


      1) The Winterbotham report had in fact clearly predicated her opinion
         on the possibility that the First-tier Tribunal would find the
         Appellant credible, and she had referenced aspects of his story
         that were consistent with the background country evidence: this
         was not a situation where the expert evidence had misunderstood
         that the Judge, rather than the report's author, was the final
         arbiter of credibility;



      2) Ms Winterbotham's opinion that Masood's faction was linked to the
         Jamiat party which was very powerful in the Appellant's home area
         resonated throughout her report and indeed aspects of it were
         cited in the First-tier Tribunal decision, but when the Judge made
         his actual findings, he simply referred to her view of the
         plausibility of the possibility of revenge lasting for a long time
         and across generations, which he rejected without reasons;



      3) In finding that the Appellant's abductions and ill treatment were
         due to causes other than those to which he attributed them,
         perhaps due to unknown actors for economic gain, the First-tier
         Tribunal overlooked material evidence that Masood's commanders
         were known to pursue their own economic interests as well as
         factional aims;



      4) The Judge's characterisation of the evidence of the three live
         witnesses to be inconsistent when they described the arms cache
         from which the family's problems arose was factually erroneous:
         their references to "guns and rockets", "tanks and big artillery"
         and "weapons" were in fact not materially discrepant;



      5) The First-tier Tribunal had failed to consider or apply the
         Practice Direction on vulnerable witnesses, notwithstanding the
         Appellant's diagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.



   20. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  10  November
       2017, giving particular mention to the first two grounds, though  not
       restricting the permission grant.


  Findings and reasons


   21. At the start of the hearing the parties informed me that they were in
       agreement that the first two grounds  of  appeal  did  indeed  evince
       material errors of law which fatally flawed the decision of the First-
       tier Tribunal. That agreement does  not  of  course  bind  the  Upper
       Tribunal, but where two such experienced advocates combine to state a
       common position, it is a weighty factor. Given this  feature  of  the
       case, I shall state my reasons on the appeal briefly.


   22. The First-tier Tribunal made a fully reasoned decision with which  it
       plainly took care. Nevertheless that does not necessarily immunise it
       from the presence of legal error: asylum appeals must  be  approached
       applying  the  appropriate  anxious  scrutiny,  and  as  Carnwath  LJ
       explained in YH  [2010] EWCA Civ 116 that term "has by usage acquired
       special significance as underlining the very special human context in
       which such cases are brought, and the need for decisions to  show  by
       their reasoning that every factor which might tell in  favour  of  an
       applicant has been properly taken  into  account."  Nevertheless,  as
       noted by Beatson LJ in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 �35, 37:


           "What is required is  that  the  reasons  must  give  sufficient
           detail to  show  the  parties  and  the  appellate  tribunal  or
           reviewing court the principles upon which the lower tribunal has
           acted, and the reasons that led it to its decision, so that they
           are able to understand why it reached its decision. The  reasons
           need not be elaborate, and need not  deal  with  every  argument
           presented ...
           judicial restraint should be exercised when the reasons  that  a
           tribunal gives for its decision are being examined and it should
           not be assumed too readily that the tribunal misdirected  itself
           because not every step in its reasoning is set out in it".


   23. It seems to me that this is one of those relatively rare cases  where
       one cannot understand the reasons why the First-tier Tribunal reached
       its ultimate conclusions, given the approach that it  itself  thought
       appropriate to the expert  evidence.  Findings  of  plausibility  are
       necessarily closely linked to  the  country  evidence  in  an  asylum
       claim, see for example Neuberger LJ in HK [2006] EWCA Civ  1037  �28:
       "in many asylum cases, some, even most, of the appellant's story  may
       seem inherently unlikely but that does not mean that  it  is  untrue.
       The ingredients of the story, and the story as a whole,  have  to  be
       considered against the available country evidence and reliable expert
       evidence, and other familiar factors, such as consistency  with  what
       the appellant has said before, and with other factual evidence (where
       there is any."


   24. In this particular appeal, very significant  aspects  of  the  expert
       evidence were left out of account in  the  final  assessment  of  the
       Appellant's  case,  notwithstanding  that  the  Judge  had  expressly
       emphasised that the  report  merited  significant  weight  given  the
       expert's familiarity with the Appellant's home area. As  set  out  in
       the grounds of appeal, there are some  nine  aspects  of  the  expert
       report (ranging  from  the  behaviour  of  Masood  loyalists  to  the
       influence that his faction has over the Appellant's home  area)  that
       raise features of the evidence of the Appellant's  account  that  are
       consistent with, expressly or by inference,  the  background  country
       evidence.


   25. I accordingly find that the First-tier Tribunal decision is flawed by
       material error of law.


   26. I was invited by Mr Bandegani to preserve certain findings within the
       decision below. Mr Tarlow, on the other hand, argued that it would be
       undesirable to tie the hands of a future judge, and  that  a  hearing
       afresh would be more appropriate.


   27. Overall I consider that the findings cannot be clearly  distinguished
       from one another, and that it would  be  unrealistic  to  fetter  the
       judgment  of  a  future  fact-finder  by  tying  them  to  particular
       paragraphs  of  the  decision  of  Judge  Pullig.  However,  I  would
       emphasise that there is no rule of law that prevents a  future  judge
       from reading the decision of an earlier one, and  given  the  general
       care that the First-tier Tribunal took in  setting  out  the  overall
       evidence, and analysing it, they would be well advised to  do  so  in
       this particular case. In so  doing  they  should  bear  in  mind  the
       important country evidence context in which the expert evidence  sets
       the overall account, to avoid repeating the  error  that  caused  the
       First-tier Tribunal to go astray in its adjudication  of  the  appeal
       last time round.


Decision


   28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed by material  error
       of law and I accordingly remit the appeal for hearing afresh.
