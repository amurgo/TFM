                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                      J

                                                                  Respondent

For the appellant:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr R B Gibb, of Duheric & Co, Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as above, but the rest of this decision refers to  them
    as they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD appeals against the decision of FtT Judge Kempton, promulgated
    on 28 August 2017.

 3. The grounds cite �22 of the decision, where the judge  found  delay  of
    several years in making the claim seriously damaging to credibility, by
    reference to section 8 of the 2004 Act.  The grounds go on:

         "At no point in the ... credibility findings and reasons at  �23  -
         32 does [the judge] refer to s. 8 or  make  any  reference  to  the
         appellant's conduct damaging his credibility.  This failure amounts
         to a material error of law."

 4. Mrs O'Brien submissions were along the lines of the grounds.

 5. I did not call upon Mr Gibb in reply.

 6. Decisions are to be read fairly and as a whole.   The  judge  explained
    clearly and extensively at �23 - 31 why she found the evidence for  the
    appellant persuasive.  The SSHD suggests no error in any of her several
    sensible reasons.  She had taken account at �22,  as  damaging  to  the
    appellant's credibility, of behaviour to which s.8 applied.  Her  final
    conclusion was reached in the round.  Nothing further was required.

 7. The SSHD's appeal is dismissed.  The decision of the FtT shall stand.

 8. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT.  Anonymity has been preserved.
