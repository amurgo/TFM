                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge Gillespie, promulgated on  20  January  2014,  dismissing  her
       appeal on all grounds.


    2. The appellant came to the UK in 2004 as  a  visitor  and  became  an
       overstayer in that year.  Her husband and  her  two  children,  then
       aged 3 and 7, came as visitors in June  2005  and  also  overstayed.
       Her case was argued on the  basis  of  the  best  interests  of  her
       children.  Having referred to ZH (Tanzania) [2012] UKSC 308  and  to
       Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 74, the judge considered the  circumstances  and
       concluded at �36, "...  this  family  cannot  rely  on  the  greater
       benefits of healthcare and  education  to  which  they  have  become
       accustomed and which in reality are at the heart of their concerns",
       and at �37,  "Evaluating  the  children's  best  interests  and  the
       implicit assumption in article 8(2) that uncontrolled immigration is
       not in the interests of the economic  wellbeing  of  the  country  I
       find,  albeit  marginally,  that  the  latter   consideration   must
       prevail."


    3. The grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  are  that  the  judge
       failed to treat the best interests of  the  children  as  a  primary
       consideration; did not assess the  best  interests  of  the  younger
       child; seemed to weigh the dyslexia and learning needs of the  older
       child against the conduct of the parents; erroneously placed  weight
       on the conduct of the parents when assessing the  interests  of  the
       children; and failed to apply tribunal  case  law  about  length  of
       residence, the need for  compelling  or  weighty  reasons,  and  the
       absence of countervailing factors in a case of children resident for
       over 7 years and well integrated into the educational system.

    4. The submissions for the  appellant  were  along  the  lines  of  the
       grounds.  Ms Hoey said that numerous factors had  been  pointed  out
       which made it unreasonable to  expect  the  children  to  return  to
       Malawi - the  age  of  the  children  length  of  time  in  the  UK,
       educational and cultural matters, degree of integration, etc  -  but
       the judge had not balanced these appropriately.  He had  gone  wrong
       in law essentially by treating the decisive question as  whether  it
       was reasonable to expect the family as a whole to  return,  when  it
       should have been whether it was reasonable to expect the children to
       return.

    5. Mrs O'Brien submitted that although the appellant said that cultural
       difficulties and educational disadvantages for the children were not
       fully addressed, the judge mentioned all the  essential  points  and
       properly concluded at �35 that with assistance of the parents  these
       could be transcended and were being overplayed.  The judge was right
       to conclude at �36 that this was essentially a case based on  health
       and educational advantages, like Zoumbas.   There  is  no  automatic
       entitlement to stay after 7 years.   The  judge  cited  the  leading
       jurisprudence, looked at best interests, and then  took  an  overall
       view on proportionality in which no legal error was  apparent.   The
       appellant disagreed with the outcome, but it could not properly have
       been otherwise.

    6. In reply, Ms Hoey suggested that �33 of the determination, where the
       judge says that both immigration control and the best  interests  of
       children are primary considerations, might be an  error.   She  also
       said that this case  is  distinguishable  from  Zoumbas,  where  the
       children were younger and the immigration history worse.

    7. I indicated that the appeal did not succeed.

    8. The judge set out and applied  the  relevant  jurisprudence  of  the
       Supreme Court.  Reading the determination fairly and as a whole,  he
       did not take into account any irrelevant factors, and did  not  fail
       to take into account any relevant factors.  There  was  no  need  to
       recite the earlier authorities mentioned in the grounds of appeal to
       the Upper Tribunal.   The case for the appellant has been pressed as
       strongly as it might have been in both tribunals,  but  her  grounds
       here are essentially only reassertion of her case  and  disagreement
       with the outcome.

    9. Each case turns in the end on its own facts, and the judge was in my
       view plainly entitled to strike the balance where he did.   I  would
       also have thought the balance should be struck there, and would  not
       have found the case marginal, as he did.  Nevertheless, and while  I
       generally have preferred the submissions for the respondent, I would
       be hesitant about holding  that  no  tribunal  could  properly  have
       reached another judgment.  That point is not crucial to the outcome,
       so it need not be taken any further.


   10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal, dismissing the appeal,
       shall stand.
