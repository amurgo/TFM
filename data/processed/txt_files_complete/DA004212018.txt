Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Skinner, Counsel instructed by Wilson
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Denmark.   He  was  born  in  1991.   He
    appeals the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss  his  appeal
    against the decision of the Respondent to make him  the  subject  of  a
    deportation order.

 2. It is  essential  that  anyone  seeking  to  understand  this  decision
    appreciates that the Appellant, as  an  EEA  national,  is  subject  to
    provisions concerning deportation that do not apply to people  who  are
    foreign  nationals.   They  are  mainly  set  out  in  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 which is Statutory Instrument
    number 1052 of 2016.

 3. It is also important to appreciate that there are findings in this case
    that  are  not  always   present   in   similar   sounding   decisions.
    Particularly at paragraph 27 the First-tier Tribunal Judge said:

         "Because the appellant has resided  in  the  UK  for  a  continuous
         period of at least ten years the decision  can  only  be  taken  on
         imperative grounds of public security."

 4. As a statement of law this is undoubtedly wrong.  A person is  entitled
    to  the  protection  of  a  decision  "imperative  grounds"  only  when
    (broadly) he is an EEA national who has resided in the  United  Kingdom
    for ten years and who as obtained a right of residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom and whose integrative links have  not  been  interrupted  by  a
    prison sentence. This summary  is  also  a  simplification  by  way  of
    introduction but it is permissible because I do not have to decide  the
    level of protection appropriate in this case.  It was agreed before the
    First-tier Tribunal that the Appellant  cannot  be  removed  under  the
    Regulations "except on imperative grounds of public security".

 5. I do not wish to imply any criticism in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's
    finding that the appellant is entitled to  this  very  high  degree  of
    protection.  Once the necessary residence has  been  established  there
    has to be an evaluative exercise considering the effect of  prison.  If
    the parties were satisfied in the light of  the  Regulations  that  the
    appellant was entitled  to  the  highest  degree  of  protection  then,
    although  the  judge  can  take  a  different  view,  it  is   possibly
    undesirable and potentially unlawful for the judge  to  interfere.  The
    judge must not favour either party to  the  appeal  or  assume  that  a
    concession should not be made when the person making it may be well  be
    informed better than is the judge. The judge certainly could  not  have
    reached a different conclusion without giving notice of that intention.
    It is not an error of law to accept a concession of fact.

 6. It must not be forgotten that in any case where an EEA national  is  to
    be deported, even if that EEA national has only the  minimum  level  of
    protection, that person cannot be deported unless:

         "The personal conduct of  the  person  must  represent  a  genuine,
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society, taking into account past  conduct
         of the person and that the threat does not need  to  be  imminent;"
         (Regulation 27(5)(c))

 7. Although the First-tier Tribunal  was  satisfied  that  both  of  these
    criteria were met and indeed that the appeal  should  be  dismissed  on
    human  rights  grounds  with  regard  to  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights, it is the Appellant's case that the reasons
    given did not justify the decision and that  the  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal could not justify the decision that  the  Appellant
    was a person whose personal conduct represented the  required  risk  or
    that there were imperative grounds to justify his removal.

 8. It is noteworthy that the reasons given  in  the  Decision  to  Make  a
    Deportation Order dated 14  June  2018  say  little  or  nothing  about
    imperative grounds.  Certainly the decision does not make reference  to
    the requirements of paragraph 27(4) but matters had  moved  on  by  the
    time the First-tier Tribunal heard the case and an important concession
    was made by the Respondent before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   However
    there is nothing in that letter which illuminates the decision.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal noted that one of the things it had  to  decide
    was "whether the  personal  conduct  of  the  appellants  represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society".  The appellant was convicted after a
    trial on two counts on an indictment, one alleging conspiracy to supply
    a controlled drug class  B  and  another  of  conspiracy  to  supply  a
    controlled drug  of  class  A,  particularly  heroin,  and  another  of
    conspiracy to supply a controlled drug of class A crack cocaine.

10. I cannot improve on the  description  of  the  appellant's  criminality
    given by the First-tier Tribunal in the Decision and Reasons that  drew
    heavily on the sentencing remarks of The  Recorder  of  Worcester,  His
    Honour Judge Juckes QC.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge said:

         "35. The Appellant was the organiser of the conspiracy.  He ran it.
          It was a commercial enterprise and a well organised business.  The
         Appellant was a person of ability who had control of what was going
         on.  The Appellant hired expensive cars to further the  conspiracy,
         one of which he took from his brother.  It was  the  Appellant  who
         established, at least one, of two dedicated drug phonelines.  'Text
         shots', the modern electronic version of 'mailshots', were set  out
         advertising drugs for sale.  The enterprise was resourceful  and  a
         client base was created in a highly competitive market.

         36.  This was a conspiracy executed over nearly five months between
         01 December 2014 and 28 April 2015.  The business started in  Hull.
         The first address from which drugs were sold was shut  down.   That
         did not stop the Appellant's conduct and  a  second  premises  were
         established, again in Hull.  That too was shut down.  That too  did
         not stop the appellant's  conduct.   The  business  then  moved  to
         Worcester where two further premises  were  set  up.   Others  were
         arrested in Worcester.  Those arrests did not deter the Appellant.

         37.  The Appellant himself was  stopped  by  the  police  once  and
         arrested twice.  Neither the stop nor the arrests deterred him.  On
         one occasion the Appellant was arrested in possession of the  drugs
         line which was then reactivated within a couple  of  hours  of  his
         release from the police  station.   HHJ  Juckes  QC  described  the
         Appellant's attitude to law enforcement as 'utterly contemptuous'."

11. The First-tier Tribunal also noted positive aspects of the  Appellant's
    character.  He was taking advantage of some of the opportunities  given
    in prison.  He was an "equalities representative" and a member  of  the
    "prison council".  He was complying with his sentence  plan  objectives
    and was described  as  polite  and  respectful.   He  was  an  enhanced
    prisoner and had been found to be drug free.

12. He continued to deny his guilt.  The judge had regard to the OASys risk
    assessment which assessed the appellant's  risk  to  the  community  as
    "low" but the judge found his failure to accept responsibility for  the
    offence to be significant so that it undermined the  relevance  of  his
    positive attitudes.  He concluded that the appellant had  not  reformed
    or rehabilitated because he still denied his guilt and the  judge  went
    on to dismiss the appeal.

13. The OASys report is in the papers.  It is dated 1 June  2018.   He  did
    indeed score as someone who was a low risk in the community.  There was
    a low risk of reoffending.  The  judge  concluded  that  the  Appellant
    remains at risk.  However I agree with Mr Skinner, who  relied  heavily
    on very well prepared grounds by Mr N Armstrong of  Counsel,  that  the
    only explanation given for the conclusion that he remains a risk is the
    judge saying as he does at paragraph 40:

         "I fail to see how he can advance this positive use of his time  as
         evidence of rehabilitation when clearly, in his mind, he  has  done
         nothing to be rehabilitated from."

14. I agree that this is indeed precisely the error identified in the  case
    of R v the Parole Board v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex
    Parte Owen John Oyston the Lord Chief Justice said:

         "Convicted  prisoners  who  persistently  deny  commission  of  the
         offence or offences of which they have been convicted  present  the
         Parole Board  with  potentially  very  difficult  decisions.   Such
         prisoners will  probably  not  express  contrition  or  remorse  or
         sympathy  for  any  victim.   They  will  probably  not  engage  in
         programmes designed  to  address  the  causes  of  their  offending
         behaviour.  Since they do not admit having offended they will  only
         undertake not to do in the future what they do  not  accept  having
         done in the past.  Where there is no admission of guilt, it may  be
         feared that a prisoner will lack any motivation to obey the law  in
         future.  Even in such cases, however, the task of the Parole  Board
         is the same as in any other case:  to  assess  the  risk  that  the
         particular prisoner if released on parole, will offend  again.   In
         making this assessment the Parole Board must assume the correctness
         of any conviction.  It can  give  no  credence  to  the  prisoner's
         denial.  Such denial will always be a factor  and  may  be  a  very
         significant factor in the Board's assessment of risk, but  it  will
         only be one factor and must be considered in the light of all other
         relevant factors.  In almost any case  the  Board  would  be  quite
         wrong to treat the prisoner's denial as irrelevant, but also  quite
         wrong to  treat  a  prisoner's  denial  as  necessarily  conclusive
         against the grant of parole."

15. The judge here has given no reason for rejecting the evidence that  the
    claimant presents a low risk except his failure to admit guilt and that
    is not irrational conclusion but an error in law.

16. Mr Jarvis argued that the judge had reached a permissible conclusion on
    future risk which was informed by the appellant's lack of frankness.  I
    do not agree.  I repeat the only reason given was the failure to  admit
    guilt and that on its own cannot be enough.

17. If this is all there was to the case then the case  would  have  to  be
    heard  again  where  proper  findings  can  be   made   including,   if
    appropriate, on the appellant's own evidence about his  intentions  and
    desires. There is some evidence to think that he no longer  presents  a
    risk.

18. However it is only necessary to decide if there is  a  future  risk  if
    there are imperative grounds for the Appellant's removal.

19. It was once almost judicial folklore  that  "imperative  grounds"  were
    reserved for issues of national security.  I doubt  that  the  law  was
    ever expressed so simply in a serious context such as a judgment but if
    that was thought then it is clearly wrong.  Any credence in  that  idea
    was firmly finished off in a decision of the Court of  Justice  of  the
    European Union in Land Baden-W�rttemberg v Tsakouridis (Case C-145/09).

20. That decision was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge and  was  relied
    on to support the conclusion that imperative grounds can exist in  drug
    cases.  Undoubtedly they can.

21.  This  is  a  convenient  place  to  acknowledge  in  my  decision  the
    seriousness with which drug abuse has to  be  viewed  by  the  criminal
    courts.  Illicit drugs very often harm their  users.   Sometimes  there
    are tragic consequences after only one dose has been taken.   Sometimes
    the drugs are not what they purport to be and taking them leads to very
    serious harm.  Sometimes a person becomes addicted  and  descends  from
    industrious living to taking every measure including criminal  measures
    and submission to sexual exploitation to raise the funds  necessary  to
    sustain his habit.  This degree of harm impacts on society as a  whole.
    Further the mess associated with drug dealing, such as  spent  needles,
    presents a hazard  to  innocent  people  and  perhaps  particularly  to
    children who might  not  appreciate  the  dangers  of  what  they  see.
    Further drug suppliers often  form  criminal  gangs  to  protect  their
    illicit businesses from competition and  surveillance.  Each  of  these
    things can have a wide impact on society.  Nothing  I  am  saying  here
    should be construed as any kind of approval of the drugs trade  or  any
    failure on my part to recognise just how serious it can  be.   It  does
    not follow from anything I have said so far that there are  "imperative
    grounds" in this case.

22. In Tsakouridis the Court decided that imperative grounds is a  "concept
    which is considerably stricter than  that  of  'serious  grounds'"  and
    that:

         "The concept of 'imperative grounds of public security' presupposes
         not only the existence of a threat to  public  security,  but  also
         that such a threat is of a particularly high degree of seriousness,
         as is reflected by the  use  of  the  words  imperative  reasons'".
         (Paragraph 40 to 41).

23. At paragraph 47 the court recognised the potential for drug trafficking
    cases to be sufficiently serious and said:

         "Since drug addiction represents a serious evil for the  individual
         and is fraught with social and economic danger to mankind (see,  to
         that effect, inter alia, Wolf v Hauptzollamt D�sseldorf Case 221/81
         [1982] ECR 3681 (para 9) and Aoulmi v France [2006] 46 EHRR 1 (para
         86)), trafficking in narcotics as part of an organised group  could
         reach a level of intensity that might directly  threaten  the  calm
         and physical security of the population as a whole or a large  part
         of it."

24. For all that has been said about the seriousness of the offence this is
    not a case where the appellant's conduct can be said to  threaten  "the
    calm and physical security of the population as a whole or a large part
    of it".

25. HHJ Juckes had  in  mind  the  sentencing  guidelines.   Reference  has
    already been made to his sentencing remarks.  However he also said:

         "As far as the question of quantities of  drugs  are  concerned  in
         this case, I will deal with this  on  the  basis  that  this  is  a
         category 2 case."

26. Elsewhere in his sentencing remarks Judge Juckes described "category 2"
    as appropriate for the quantity and periods involved and identified the
    range of sentences as between nine and thirteen years. He then  imposed
    a sentence of 12 years imprisonment.

27. The sentencing guidelines were was not raised before me  but  the  Drug
    Offence Definitive Guideline is  a  public  domain  document  available
    online and this confirms that the appropriate range for  a  category  2
    offence involving class A drugs and their supply is  nine  to  thirteen
    years.  In short the trial judge  did  not  regard  this  as  the  most
    serious kind of drug offence. The most serious offences  involving  the
    misuse of drugs can be punished by imprisonment for life.

28. It would be too crude to suggest that imperative reasons can only exist
    in the case of the most  serious  kind  of  drug  offences  but  it  is
    important in  a  case  such  as  this  to  keep  a  check  on  reality.
    Imperative grounds exist in the most serious cases.  This is a  serious
    case, which is why it was punished with twelve years' imprisonment  but
    that is all that it is.  It is not the most serious kind.

29. As explained above, the Respondent's Decision  to  Make  a  Deportation
    Order did not accept that there had to be "imperative grounds"  and  so
    does not explain why there are imperative grounds in this case.

30.  Deplorable  as  the  Appellant's  behaviour  may  be,  I  can  see  no
    justification for concluding that it threatened "the calm and  physical
    security of the population as a whole or a large part of it".

31. In  my  judgment  when  the  requirements  of  imperative  grounds  are
    remembered  dispassionately  this  is  not  such  a  case   where   the
    Applicant's deportation is imperative and the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    was wrong to say otherwise.

32. It follows that I find on the facts given the case cannot  satisfy  the
    imperative grounds test and therefore the appeal has to be allowed.

33. I repeat here for emphasis that this is a decision  based  on  its  own
    particular facts and it depends to a high degree on  the  Secretary  of
    State accepting that the "imperative grounds" test applies.

34. Nevertheless, for the reasons given, the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in
    law. I set aside its decision and I substitute a decision allowing  the
    appeal on EEA grounds.
