Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  Mr  P  Saini,
instructed by City Heights Solicitors, on behalf of the applicant and  Mr  R
Evans, instructed by the  Government  Legal  Department  on  behalf  of  the

It is ordered that


    1) The judicial review application is dismissed in accordance  with  the
       judgment attached.

    2)  I  order,  therefore,  that  the  judicial  review  application   be
       dismissed.

    3) There was no application for permission to appeal  to  the  Court  of
       Appeal. In any event, I have considered, and  refuse,  permission  to
       appeal to the Court of Appeal  for  the  same  reasons  that  I  have
       refused the orders sought for judicial review.

       Notification of appeal rights


       A decision by the Upper  Tribunal  on  an  application  for  judicial
       review is a decision that disposes of proceedings.


       A party may appeal against such a decision to the Court of Appeal  on
       a question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply
       to the Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the
       decision is given. If no  application  is  made,  the  Tribunal  must
       nonetheless consider  at  the  hearing  whether  to  give  or  refuse
       permission to appeal (rule 44(4B) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
       Tribunal) Rules 2008).


       If  the  Tribunal  refuses  permission,  either  in  response  to  an
       application or by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the  party  wishing  to
       appeal can apply for permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This
       must be done by filing an applicant's notice with the  Civil  Appeals
       Office of the Court  of  Appeal  within  28  days  of  the  date  the
       Tribunal's decision on permission to appeal was sent (Civil Procedure
       Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

                       APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW
                                  JUDGMENT

                                    [pic]

    The application

          1) The applicant applied on 17 July 2019 for judicial  review  of
             the respondent's decisions of 29 March 2019  (the  'Decision')
             and the subsequent administrative review decision dated 2  May
             2019, to refuse the applicant's application on 7 June 2018 for
             leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.  The
             respondent refused the applicant's application  on  the  basis
             that  he  did  not  meet   the   requirements   of   paragraph
             41(a)(ii)(5) of the Immigration Rules, as he had not  provided
             correspondence from the venture capital firm, which he claimed
             had agreed to invest in his business, which confirmed that the
             venture capital firm was registered with the Financial Conduct
             Authority and its entry in the register included a  permission
             to arrange, deal  in  or  manage  investments,  or  to  manage
             alternative  investment  funds.  Whilst   the   correspondence
             provided by the applicant  stated  that  Active  Capital  BVBA
             ('Active Capital') claimed that it was  listed  on  the  FCA's
             public register with  permission  to  arrange  investments  in
             venture capital, in [pic]fact the FCA's register indicated, at
             the  time  of  the  Decision,  that   Active   Capital's   FCA
             authorisation did not include permission to arrange,  deal  in
             or manage investments.

          2) The  applicant  requested  an  administrative  review  of  the
             Decision on 11 April 2019, asserting that  the  correspondence
             provided the required confirmation and that  the  language  of
             the Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")  did  not  require  the
             applicant to provide any further evidence of the  FCA's  grant
             of  permission  to  Active  Capital.  The  applicant   further
             asserted that his application should  not  have  been  refused
             before the respondent's assertion about Active Capital's  lack
             of permission for relevant activities had been put to him,  to
             allow him the chance to respond.  The  respondent's  assertion
             that any further enquiries would not change the outcome of the
             decision was speculative.

          3) The respondent maintained the Decision in  its  administrative
             review decision, reiterating that Active Capital's  permission
             did not extend to venture capital activities, as confirmed  on
             the public FCA register and instead, it was only authorised to
             conduct re-insurance business. The correspondence from  Active
             Capital,  claiming  to  have  permission  previously,  up   to
             September 2018,  was  unsupported  by  any  other  independent
             evidence. It was the applicant's responsibility to ensure that
             his application met the requirements of the Immigration Rules,

          4) The applicant raised six grounds  in  seeking  permission  for
             judicial review:

               a.  Ground  (1)  the   Decision   was   irrational/Wednesbury
                  unreasonable. The applicant had provided ample evidence of
                  Active  Capital's  entry  on  the  FCA  register  of   its
                  permission to arrange investment funds. In this case,  the
                  applicant  relied  upon  the  correspondence  from  Active
                  Capital of its claimed prior  permission.  The  respondent
                  had imported an additional requirement,  not  included  in
                  the Rules, of independent confirmation from the  FCA.  All
                  that was required was a letter from Active  Capital  which
                  was  correspondence  confirming  registration.  This   was
                  consistent with the respondent's own policy guidance;

               b. Ground (2) -  the  respondent  made  a  mistake  of  fact,
                  through her failure to have regard to material factors and
                  evidence, in particular  the  correspondence  from  Active
                  Capital;

               c. Ground (3) the respondent failed to consider the Rules and
                  the fact that the correspondence from Active  Capital  met
                  the requirements of those rules;

               d. Ground (4) - the respondent  failed  to  act  consistently
                  with a duty of common law fairness, in particular  failing
                  to  give  the  applicant  the  opportunity  to  meet   the
                  respondent's concerns prior to refusing his application;

               e. Ground  (5)  -  the  respondent  failed  to  give  anxious
                  scrutiny to the applicant's  application,  in  particular,
                  Active  Capital's  business  model,  under  which  it  had
                  structured its  investment  through  syndication  to  sub-
                  investors in Southeast Asia, who had yet  to  provide  any
                  investment to the applicant;

               f. Ground  (6)  -  the  respondent  failed  to  exercise  her
                  residual discretion in favour of the applicant.

          5) On 29 August 2019, Upper Tribunal  Judge  Kamara  granted  the
             application for permission to proceed to judicial  review,  on
             the basis that it was at least arguable  that  the  respondent
             had acted in an irrational manner, failing to have  regard  to
             all of the evidence or to act fairly.

    The basis of the respondent's resistance to the application

          6) In the Acknowledgement of  Service,  the  respondent  asserted
             that the Rules require not only the provision of a  letter  by
             the relevant venture capital company; but that it be shown  on
             the FCA register as having the  relevant  permission.  A  mere
             assertion  in  correspondence  from  Active  Capital  was  not
             sufficient, bearing in mind that paragraph 41(a)(ii)(5) of the
             Rules required confirmation, not merely  a  statement  of  the
             necessary information. Active Capital was  only  permitted  to
             conduct  re-insurance  business;  correspondence  from  Active
             Capital to the contrary  could  not  remedy  that  absence  of
             authorisation.

          7) Prior to filing detailed grounds  of  defence,  on  9  October
             2019, the respondent applied for  permission  to  disclose  an
             email from the FCA  in  respect  of  another  judicial  review
             application,  R  (on  behalf  of  Vijay  Mistry)  v   SSHD   -
             JR/812/2019.  Principal  Resident   Judge   O'Connor   granted
             permission  for   disclosure   but   made   clear   that   its
             admissibility was a  matter  for  this  Tribunal  hearing  the
             substantive judicial review application.

          8) Following  the  grant  of  permission,  the  respondent  filed
             detailed grounds of defence as well as a witness statement  of
             Danyaal  Mushtaq,   one   of   the   respondent's   litigation
             caseworkers in respect of the Mistry application,  which  also
             involved claimed investment by Active Capital. The email  from
             the FCA suggested that Active Capital did not have  permission
             for venture capital activities, which led the FCA  to  believe
             the parties may have been dealing with a 'clone firm scam'.

          9) The detailed grounds of defence reiterated:

               a. the purpose behind the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) rules, namely
                  that an applicant must  demonstrate  �50,000  having  been
                  invested in the business; or that such  an  investment  is
                  available to be invested  by  the  venture  capital  firm.
                  Active Capital  was  not  permitted  to  make  such  money
                  available, and  correspondence  from  it  could  not  give
                  'confirmation'  of  such  permission,  if  it  no   longer
                  existed;

               b. as a consequence, the Decision was not irrational;

               c. the exercise of the respondent's powers  of  refusal  were
                  not dependent on a precedent fact, so  that  the  Decision
                  could only be impugned on public law grounds;

               d. the respondent had  considered  the  Rules,  with  anxious
                  scrutiny;

               e. there was no requirement on  the  respondent  to  put  her
                  concerns to the applicant prior to  making  the  decision.
                  The price of consistency and predictability in  a  points-
                  based system might be 'hard' decisions, in some cases,  as
                  endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Alam v SSHD [2012] EWCA
                  Civ 2012.

               f. Finally, even if this Tribunal were to conclude  that  the
                  respondent' s decision was unreasonable, on the  basis  of
                  the additional evidence provided  from  the  FCA,  it  was
                  highly likely that the outcome for the applicant would not
                  have been substantially different and so relief should not
                  be granted pursuant to section 31 of the Senior Courts Act
                  1981 and section  15(5A)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
                  Enforcement Act 2007 ('TCEA').

    The respondent's application to amend the grounds and the admissibility
    of the 'Mistry' evidence

         10) The applicant asserted that the evidence from the  FCA  should
             not be admitted. The email from the FCA, which existed at  the
             time of the respondent's pre-action  response,  had  not  been
             referred to or  disclosed  earlier.  The  respondent  had  not
             complied with her duty of candour as per R (on the application
             of Saha) v SSHD (Secretary of State's duty of candour)  [2017]
             UKUT 17 (IAC).

         11) In addition, if this Tribunal were to admit further  evidence,
             it  would  encourage  'rolling  reviews',   which   had   been
             discouraged in the case of R on the application of FT) v  SSHD
             ('rolling review';  challenging  leave  granted)  [2017]  UKUT
             00331 (IAC); and in R (on the application of  Spahiu)  v  SSHD
             [2018] EWCA Civ 2604.

         12) In addition, if the evidence were admitted, that would  amount
             to procedural unfairness as the evidence from the FCA and  the
             issues it raised were not raised as part of the Decision.  The
             applicant would be denied a proper opportunity  to  deal  with
             the evidence, noting the authority of Balajigari v SSHD [2019]
             EWCA Civ 673. The applicant was innocent of any wrongdoing and
             was  a   victim,   which   made   the   respondent's   refusal
             substantially unfair, as per the authority of R v  SSHD  ex  p
             Doody [1994] 1 AC 531.

         13) In any event, the evidence did not suggest that Active Capital
             did not have the  required  permission  at  the  time  of  the
             applicant's application, but only many months later on 22  May
             2019, the date of the FCA's email.

         14) In his reply, the applicant reiterated that  the  requirements
             of the Rules included only that the applicant provide relevant
             correspondence; the requirement  of  confirmation  mirrored  a
             similar requirement  under  paragraph  41(a)(ii)(1)  that  the
             correspondence must confirm the amount of money  available  to
             the applicant. The respondent was not seeking to suggest  that
             there  must  be  independent  third-party  evidence   of   the
             availability of that money, and  similarly  could  not  expect
             independent  evidence  of   FCA   permission.   Instead,   the
             requirement was for 'specified documents' and the respondent's
             interpretation would otherwise create a whole new  requirement
             for specified evidence. Any ambiguity could not be resolved in
             the respondent's favour. The respondent could not 'toughen up'
             the rules except by way of amendment to them, (see Pokhriyal v
             SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1568).

         15) As a final point, although not referred to in the grounds,  on
             29 March 2019, paragraph  41(a)(ii)  of  the  Rules  may  have
             already been amended  and  replaced  with  the  provisions  of
             paragraph 41-SD.

    Hearing - scope of issues and admissibility of new evidence

         16) At the beginning of the hearing, I agreed with Mr Saini and Mr
             Evans how I should proceed with the admissibility of  'Mistry'
             evidence and also the scope of the challenges before me.  Both
             agreed that I was not being asked to determine  the  issue  of
             whether  Active  Capital  was  registered  by  the  FCA  as  a
             precedent fact; and specifically, there were no allegations of
             deception or misrepresentation against the applicant.  In  the
             circumstances, the additional  evidence  relied  upon  by  the
             respondent,  particularly  correspondence  from  the  FCA   in
             relation to the separate case of Mistry,  needed  only  to  be
             dealt with at the stage of relief, i.e. whether, if I were  to
             find that the respondent's decisions were  both  substantively
             and/or procedurally unreasonable/ unfair, and whether  section
             31 of the Senior Courts Act and section 15(5A) TCEA applied

         17) I also agreed with Mr Saini that despite the reference in  the
             reply to a different version of the Rules  applying,  in  fact
             there had been some confusion about what version the Rules had
             been contained on the respondent's archive, as opposed to what
             was in force at the date of the Decision. He was  specifically
             content to proceed  based  on  the  Rules  relied  on  by  the
             respondent in the Decision and not  a  subsequent  version  of
             them which according to  a  Statement  of  Changes  had  taken
             effect the day after the respondent's  decision,  i.e.  on  30
             March 2019. The applicable version of the Rules was the one in
             force at the date the Decision, 29 March  2019  (see:  Odelola
             (FC) v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25).

         18) Mr Saini and Mr Evans also agreed that I should proceed,  when
             considering  the  application,  on  the  basis   that   Active
             Capital's permission to  conduct  venture  capital  activities
             ceased on an unspecified day  in  September  2018.  What  this
             meant was that taking the applicant's  case  at  its  highest,
             when he applied on 7 June 2018 for  leave  to  remain,  I  was
             asked  to  assume  that  Active  Capital  had   the   required
             permission; but by the time of the Decision on 29 March  2019,
             that permission had  ceased  some  months  earlier.  That  was
             consistent with the correspondence from Active Capital dated 4
             April 2019, at page  [138]  of  the  applicant's  main  bundle
             ("AB"), which stated:

                  "... we had the permission in venture capital business  in
                  September 2018. ... The FCA  permits  the  following  from
                  January 2018 to September 2018:

                   1. Exempt MIFID (Article 2)

                   2. Venture capital business only

                   3. Insurance products and services.'[pic]

         19) Based on the  above  assumptions,  I  was  asked  to  consider
             whether  the  respondent  had  been  entitled  to  reject  the
             applicant's application. On the one hand, Mr Saini argued that
             the requirements of the Rules could  be  satisfied  by  Active
             Capital's correspondence, which necessarily could  only  be  a
             snapshot at a particular time, and  the  applicant  need  only
             meet the Rules at the date of his application on 7 June 2018.

         20) In contrast, Mr Evans submitted that the applicant  needed  to
             meet the Rules at the date of the Decision on 29  March  2019.
             In simple terms,  if,  taking  the  applicant's  case  at  its
             highest, Active Capital no longer had permission to manage  or
             invest in venture capital business by the date of the Decision
             (when such permission had ceased the  previous  October),  the
             Decision could not be impugned  on  public  law  grounds;  the
             procedure which the respondent had  adopted  in  reaching  the
             Decision was the only appropriate one; and even if I  were  to
             find some sort of procedural irregularity or  unfairness,  the
             applicant should not be granted relief, as Active Capital  did
             not have the required permission any longer and so  could  not
             manage any investment in the applicant's business,  which  was
             the very purpose of his Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) application.

    The law

         21) I agreed with Mr  Saini  and  Mr  Evans  the  version  of  the
             relevant Rules which applied, i.e. those at the  date  of  the
             Decision, relevant excerpts of which are set out below.

                  "Attributes for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants

                  35.  An applicant applying for entry clearance,  leave  to
                        remain or indefinite leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
                        (Entrepreneur) Migrant must  score  75  points  for
                        attributes.

                  36(a)      Subject to paragraph 37, available  points  for
                        initial applications for entry clearance  or  leave
                        to  remain  are  as  shown  in  Table  4,  read  in
                        conjunction with the Notes.

                  Table 4: Initial applications as referred to in  paragraph
                  36

                  1(b) At least �50,000 is available  to  the  applicant  or
                        their  business  or  has  been  invested  in  their
                        business due to an activity, from:

                        (i) one or more venture capital firms regulated  by
                             the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA')."

         22) Paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules continues:

                  "41(a)     If all or part of the money has  not  yet  been
                        invested in the applicant's business, the applicant
                        must provide all of the specified documents set out
                        in the relevant row  of  Table  4A  below.  If  the
                        applicant is claiming points  for  available  money
                        from more  than  one  source,  the  applicant  must
                        provide the specified documents for each row  which
                        applies."

             Table 4A states:

                  "Money available from a venture capital firm, as  set  out
                  in Table 4

                  Specified documents

                  (ii) A letter from a director, partner or fund manager  of
                      the venture capital firm, which includes:

                        1) confirmation of the amount of money available  to
                           the applicant, the entrepreneurial  team  or  the
                           applicant's business from the organisation,

                        2) a statement providing detailed information on the
                           strategy, structure and financial exposure of the
                           fund,

                        3) a  statement  detailing  the  rationale  for  the
                           investment, providing specific information  about
                           the circumstances tvhich led  to  the  investment
                           decision,

                        4) a statement confirming that the business/proposed
                           business is a genuine and  credible  proposition,
                           and

                        5) confirmation that the  venture  capital  firm  is
                           registered with the Financial  Conduct  Authority
                           (FCA) and its entry in the  register  includes  a
                           permission  to  arrange,  deal   in   or   manage
                           investments, or to manage alternative  investment
                           funds. '[pic]

    Discussion and conclusions

    Challenge to the substantive decision

         23) Mr Saini said that while previous Counsel who had settled  the
             grounds had identified 6 bases of challenge  to  the  Decision
             and the subsequent administrative review,  in  reality,  these
             could be focussed in two areas, the substance of the  Decision
             itself; and the procedure by which the Decision  was  reached.
             In further submissions  following  the  hearing,  he  focussed
             particularly on procedural  unfairness,  submitting  that  the
             applicant did not rely on 'substantive unfairness', and  as  a
             consequence, Pathan & Anor v. Secretary of State for the  Home
             Department [2018] EWCA Civ 2103, referred to by the respondent
             was of no relevance, particularly as the Court  of  Appeal  in
             Pathan sought to criticise the earlier Upper Tribunal decision
             of Patel (revocation of  sponsor  licence  -  fairness)  India
             [2011] UKUT 211 (IAC) and recharacterize  it  as  relating  to
             substantive unfairness. Mr Saini, having referred  to  Tier  4
             cases, such as where Confirmations of Acceptance  for  Studies
             or 'CAS' had been revoked, did not rely to any material extent
             on such cases, which were only relevant as they had echoed the
             unreasonableness of  expecting  applicants  to  keep  checking
             public registers, in this case, the FCA register,  to  see  if
             Active Capital's permission had lapsed.

         24) Taking first the  substance  of  the  Decision,  I  reject  Mr
             Saini's primary submission that  the  provision  of  paragraph
             41(ii)(5) of the Rules,  as  properly  read  in  its  context,
             requires no more than correspondence from the venture  capital
             firm at the date of  the  applicant's  application  confirming
             relevant FCA permission, even if that permission ends prior to
             the respondent reaching her decision. Mr Evans'  reference  to
             paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Rules, which emphasise that points
             are scored where the relevant �50,000 'is' available, is  not,
             as Mr Saini asserts, a supplemental reason or decision of  the
             kind criticised in Caroopen & Myrie v. SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
             1307; rather, it is the context in which paragraph 41 must  be
             read, namely that the permission of which  the  correspondence
             from the venture capital firm is confirmation, must be current
             not only at  the  date  on  which  the  venture  capital  firm
             correspondence was written, but on the date of a  decision  by
             the respondent. I gained fortification for that interpretation
             not only because of the context of paragraph 36 and the  whole
             purpose of applications where investments have yet to be made,
             but also the Court of Appeal in Iqbal v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ
             169   where   Lord   Justice   Vos,   when   considering   the
             interpretation  of  paragraph  41-SD  of  Appendix  A  of  the
             Immigration Rules, confirmed what  was  said  by  the  Supreme
             Court in Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC  16,  and
             at paragraph [33] stated:

             "[33]     As Lord Brown explained, the court  should  properly
                  have regard  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  purpose  and
                  intention as discerned objectively from  the  words  used.
                  The court will also lean against an  absurd  construction,
                  where  the  words  in  question  can  bear  the  preferred
                  alternative meaning (see  Jacob  LJ  in  Lewis  v  Eliades
                  [2004] 1 WLR 692  at  paragraphs  58-61).  But  the  court
                  cannot and should not construe the  Secretary  of  State's
                  Rules to mean something different from  what,  on  a  fair
                  objective reading, they actually say. In  this  case,  the
                  two main construction points advanced respectively  by  Mr
                  Iqbal and Mr Macdonald urged that result."

         25) To interpret paragraph 41 of the Rules to mean  that  provided
             there is correspondence from the venture capital firm  at  the
             date of the application, the requirements of the  Rules  would
             be met, even when by the date of  the  respondent's  decision,
             the correspondence no longer reflected the applicant's current
             circumstances, would be  to  take  paragraph  41  out  of  the
             context of the general requirement at Table 4, as referred  to
             by paragraph 36(a), that at least �50,000 "is" available  ([my
             emphasis]), and the further context to  paragraph  46(a)  that
             the investment has yet to be  made.  Were  the  interpretation
             advanced by Mr Saini to be correct, the absurd situation would
             arise, as in the applicant's case at  its  highest,  that  the
             respondent would be bound to grant Tier 1 entrepreneur  leave,
             as a result of a  specific  proposed  investment  by  a  named
             venture capital firm, even where she knew that by the time  of
             her decision, permission by the FCA for  the  venture  capital
             firm to manage that investment had ceased. This would  not  be
             the case that funds had been made available to the  applicant,
             who could nevertheless utilise those funds. In this case, what
             was being posited was a  scenario  where  no  funds  had  been
             advanced, financial  permission  to  invest  those  funds  had
             ceased and yet Mr  Saini  asserted  that  the  respondent  was
             nevertheless obliged to grant leave to remain for the purposes
             of effecting that investment.

         26) Instead, I accept Mr  Evans'  submission  that  the  specified
             document must confirm facts which remain accurate at the  date
             of the respondent's decision.  Whilst  that  may  be  a  harsh
             outcome because there will  naturally  be  circumstances  when
             there have  been  a  withdrawal  or  cessation  of  permission
             between the date of the application and the eventual decision,
             nevertheless  to  decide  otherwise  would  result  in  absurd
             outcomes.

         27) I also reject Mr Saini's submission that the Decision imported
             an additional requirement, not included in paragraph 41 of the
             Rules, of further corroborative evidence from  the  FCA  about
             Active Capital's FCA permission. The Decision  stated,  on  29
             March 2019, that Active Capital's entry on the  FCA  register:
             "does not include permission to arrange, deal in or management
             investments." That was the sole basis on which points were not
             awarded, and to reiterate, taking the applicant's case at  its
             highest, at the date  of  the  Decision,  that  statement  was
             correct. The subsequent reference in the administrative review
             response to independent evidence from the FCA was in  response
             to the applicant's request for  administrative  review,  which
             had specifically adduced further  correspondence  from  Active
             Capital, which post-dated the Decision,  and  in  reliance  on
             which the applicant asserted that '[Active Capital] are  still
             on the register and do not have any  exclusions'  ([125]  AB).
             The respondent's reference to corroboration was in response to
             the applicant's apparent insinuation (although not so  clearly
             put) that Active Capital had permission  for  venture  capital
             activities, when  the  evidence  from  the  FCA  register  was
             directly to the contrary, by the date  of  the  Decision;  the
             applicant now no longer puts his case that  high,  and  merely
             asserts that Active Capital previously had permission.

         28) In summary, I do not  regard  the  respondent's  reference  to
             corroborative   evidence   as   imposing   an    impermissible
             requirement, when it was  faced  with  an  apparent  assertion
             about current FCA permission which  was  contradicted  by  the
             official  record,  the  FCA's  register.  The   reference   to
             corroboration did not form part of the Decision  and  so  does
             not undermine it; and the reference was only made in  response
             to post Decision correspondence. I do not  accept  Mr  Saini's
             alternative submission that reference to corroboration in  the
             administrative review response meant that the Decision  itself
             was implicitly based on the premise that correspondence  which
             remained accurate at the date of application, rather than date
             of the Decision, was sufficient. Neither the challenge in  the
             administrative review request, nor the  response  to  it  have
             direct bearing on the point that Active Capital no longer  had
             relevant FCA permission for venture capital activities at  the
             date of the Decision.

         29) Instead, the Decision could not have been clearer  as  to  the
             reasons  why  the  respondent  had  refused  the   application
             ([133]):

             "You have provided a letter from the Fund Manager which states
             that Active Capital BVBA "is listed on the public register  of
             FCA  with  permission  to  arrange  investments   in   venture
             capital". However, Active Capital  BVBA's  entry  on  the  FCA
             register does not include permission to arrange,  deal  in  or
             manage investments, or to manage alternative investment funds.
             Therefore we have been unable to award points  for  access  to
             funds."

         30) The Decision did not ask for  further  corroborative  evidence
             and did not refer to Active Capital's previous FCA  permission
             from January and September 2018. It simply stated that at  the
             date of the Decision, the FCA register did not  record  Active
             Capital as having relevant permission, which it did not.

    Procedural unfairness

         31) In relation to the other grounds,  which  Mr  Saini  helpfully
             combined together to relate to  the  procedure  by  which  the
             respondent reached the Decision, he submitted that even if the
             Rules required Active Capital to have relevant FCA  permission
             at the date of the Decision, the respondent should have  given
             the applicant  the  opportunity  to  counter  or  address  the
             concerns  raised  by  the  respondent.  The  fact   that   the
             respondent  raised  the  corroborative  requirement   in   the
             administrative review response, after the Decision,  reflected
             the respondent's error in attempting to resolve new issues  in
             the administrative review process, as outlined in  Balajigari,
             to which I have already referred. The respondent had failed to
             allow the applicant to respond to concerns prior  to  reaching
             the Decision and had raised the  corroboration  issue  at  the
             last minute.

         32) I agree with Mr Evans' submission that,  while  the  applicant
             purported to challenge the respondent on grounds of procedural
             fairness, in reality, these were challenges to  the  substance
             of the Decision.

         33) By way of example, one of the procedural  grounds  related  to
             the respondent's reliance on paragraph  245AA  of  the  Rules,
             which includes a provision that where documents have not  been
             submitted with an application, the  decision  maker  may  seek
             further documents, but will not do so where he or  she  thinks
             that submission of correct or missing documents will not  lead
             to a grant of permission. In  this  case,  all  the  applicant
             would have been able to do, taking his case  at  its  highest,
             would have been to produce a record of the FCA register as  at
             the date of his application in  June  2018.  The  current  FCA
             register record was already public and available (and is  that
             on which the respondent reached  the  Decision)  on  29  March
             2019, which confirmed that  Active  Capital's  permission  had
             already ceased. A copy of the June 2018 register would not  be
             relevant, when the venture capital firm needs to maintain  its
             FCA permission at the date of  the  respondent's  decision.  A
             challenge to that, is a challenge  to  the  substance  of  the
             Decision.

         34) The applicant also says that he should have  been  allowed  to
             understand the gist of the respondent's concerns, in order  to
             respond to them (see Doody above). However, this is not, as Mr
             Saini raised and initially accepted, a case analogous to  Tier
             4 student visas, where a 'CAS' ceases to be valid  because  of
             the  loss  of  sponsoring  college's  licence  and  where  the
             respondent has a published policy allowing  a  'grace'  period
             during which someone can attempt to obtain an alternative CAS.
             Later in his oral submissions, when asked to identify what the
             benefit  would  be  of  warning  the  applicant  that   Active
             Capital's permission had ceased and that  the  respondent  was
             minded to refuse his application, Mr Saini advanced  precisely
             that proposition, namely that the applicant should  have  been
             notified, so that he could vary his application  and  seek  an
             alternative  venture  capital  firm's  investment.  Mr   Saini
             identified no other option  or  possible  'challenge'  to  the
             Decision, in  circumstances  where  it  was  based  on  Active
             Capital  having  current  FCA  permission.  In  reality,   the
             challenge based on an opportunity to  respond  or  'understand
             the gist' ultimately boiled  down  to  a  challenge  that  the
             respondent should have imported a 'grace period' or 'minded to
             refuse' stage  into  the  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  application
             process, to allow an alternative investor to be sought.

         35) Once again, in the applicant's circumstances, I conclude  that
             what  are  put  as  'procedural'  challenges  are   ultimately
             challenges to the substance of the Decision.  In  contrast  to
             Balajigari, the respondent did  not  claim,  in  reaching  the
             Decision, that the applicant had engaged in deception.  As  Mr
             Evans identified, in common  with  EK  (Ivory  Coast)  v  SSHD
             [2014] EWCA Civ 1517, and as  referred  to  by  the  Court  of
             Appeal in Pathan[pic]  the  respondent  had  not  changed  her
             position, such as revoking a sponsoring college's licence; and
             practically speaking, while only the respondent knew when  she
             would reach a decision on a Tier 1 application, there  was  no
             reason to think she would have any more prior  knowledge  than
             the applicant of when Active Capital would cease to  have  FCA
             permission, or the circumstances of such  permission  ceasing.
             In contrast to sponsoring educational  colleges  with  perhaps
             hundreds  of  students,   the   applicant   had   individually
             negotiated with Active Capital the terms of its investment  in
             his business and could  reasonably  be  expected  to  have  an
             ongoing dialogue with them in the context  of  their  business
             relationship, particularly where the investment had yet to  be
             made, so that all parties would be in a position  to  progress
             those investments. While the applicant could not  be  expected
             to check the FCA register daily during  the  period  when  the
             respondent was  considering  his  application,  there  was  no
             positive obligation on the  respondent  to  notify  him  of  a
             change in a public register, which it was open to him to check
             at his convenience, but more importantly, in the context of  a
             regular dialogue between the applicant and  his  investor,  in
             his business. Their business relationship was  more  analogous
             to the Tier 2 employment relationships  considered  in  Pathan
             than the Tier 4 student applications considered in Patel.  The
             fact that the respondent has not introduced a  'grace'  period
             equivalent to Tier 4 (student) applications, does  not  render
             the process by  which  the  respondent  reached  the  Decision
             procedurally unfair.

         36)  In  the  circumstances,  the  Decision  was  one   that   was
             unquestionably open to the respondent on the  evidence  before
             her  at  the  time,  because  Active  Capital  no  longer  had
             permission to engage in venture  capital  activities,  and  to
             construe a  requirement  that  the  respondent  grant  Tier  1
             (Entrepreneur) leave in  circumstances  where  she  knew  that
             permission had ceased would produce an  absurd  result.  There
             was no procedural flaw or irregularity, on public law grounds,
             in the applicant not having been  granted  an  opportunity  to
             meet those concerns, or in reality what was sought, to  obtain
             an  alternative  investor  prior  to  his  application   being
             rejected. The applicant has not lost  the  benefit  of  lawful
             leave to remain, as he was an overstayer at the  date  of  his
             Tier 1 application, albeit for  a  sufficiently  brief  period
             that it  might  have  been  disregarded  in  the  event  of  a
             successful application. I reject Mr Saini's assertion that the
             fact of his overstaying, which might  result  in  any  out-of-
             country application for entry clearance  being  refused,  adds
             weight  to  the  assertion  of  procedural   unfairness.   The
             applicant's real  challenge  is  that  he  did  not  meet  the
             requirement of the Rules at the date of the  Decision  through
             no fault of his own. However, that situation arose for reasons
             for  which  the  respondent  cannot  be  criticised,  and   in
             circumstances where there was no policy (and  consequently  no
             possible expectation) of a 'grace' period. While the applicant
             asserts procedural unfairness, the Decision reflects  that  he
             does not meet the Rules and did  not  meet  them  some  months
             prior to the Decision.

         37) For those reasons, I conclude that the Decision  is  a  lawful
             and rational one.

         38) In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to consider the
             question  of  whether  relief  should  have  been  refused  by
             reference to section 31 of  the  Senior  Courts  Act  1981  or
             section 15(5A) of TCEA. It was  also  unnecessary  for  me  to
             consider the further evidence from the FCA  of  2019,  or  the
             witness statement of Mr Mushtaq.

         39) For the above reasons, the application for judicial review  is
             refused.
