                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 4th  of  December  1984.
    She appealed against  a  decision  of  the  Respondent  to  refuse  her
    application to vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  Her  appeal
    was allowed at first instance  by  Judge  of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    Suffield-Thompson sitting at  Newport  on  16  of  December  2014.  The
    Respondent appealed that decision and following a hearing on  30  April
    2015 in the Upper Tribunal I set aside the decision of  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal by  reason  of  a  material  error  of  law  in  the  original
    determination. I directed that the appeal be reheard before me. Annexed
    to this determination is a copy of my reasons for finding an  error  of
    law in the first instance decision. Although the  case  initially  came
    before me as an appeal by the Respondent,  as  I  have  set  aside  the
    decision at first instance (albeit retaining certain findings of  fact)
    I shall continue to refer to the parties as they were  referred  to  at
    first instance.

2.   The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 21  February  2011  with
    entry clearance as a spouse valid from 28th of January  2011  until  23
    April 2013. At the time of entry she was married to  a  Mr  Malik,  the
    marriage having taken place on 31st August 2005. In  February  2014  (3
    years  after  the  Appellant's  entry  into  the  United  Kingdom)  the
    Appellant and Mr Malik separated due to Mr Malik's infidelity and  ill-
    treatment of the Appellant. The Appellant met her  current  husband  Mr
    Ibala Hussein a United Kingdom citizen  ("the  Sponsor").  He  ran  the
    recruitment agency where she found work.  She  rented  a  room  in  the
    Sponsor's house from April 2014. They formed a relationship and married
    in the United Kingdom on 10th of September 2014. The Appellant lives in
    the same house where she initially rented the room and she shares  this
    house with the Sponsor, her mother-in-law  and  the  Sponsor's  younger
    brother ("Y"). Both the Appellant and the Sponsor work full  time.  The
    Appellant earns �16,275 gross per annum working  for  Primark  and  the
    Sponsor earns �20,000 gross per annum making a total income of  �36,275
    well in excess of the financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM  to  the
    immigration rules.

3.   The Appellant argues that the refusal of her application to vary  leave
    breaches this country's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights
    Convention (the right to respect for  private  and  family  life).  The
    burden of proof of establishing this rests upon the Appellant  and  the
    standard  of  proof  is  the  usual  civil  standard  of   balance   of
    probabilities. The Appellant also claims  to  be  entitled  to  succeed
    under the provisions of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  but  this
    point was not pursued with any force before me.

The Proceedings at First Instance

4.   On 8th of February 2013 the Appellant applied for a variation of  leave
    on the basis of her marriage to Mr Malik. The Respondent  refused  that
    application on 11 March 2014 and  the  Appellant  lodged  a  notice  of
    appeal on 26th of March 2014 against the Respondent's decision. However
    when the matter came before the First-Tier Tribunal on 16th of December
    2014 the Appellant indicated that she was no longer proceeding with the
    application for leave to remain as the spouse of Mr Malik but rather as
    the spouse of the Sponsor. As I indicated in my error  of  law  finding
    this development took the Respondent by surprise as the Respondent  had
    not known about the  change  in  the  application  until  the  date  of
    hearing. Nevertheless at the hearing at first instance  the  presenting
    officer indicated that the matter could proceed there and then  as  the
    presenting officer was content to test the genuineness or otherwise  of
    the Appellant's second marriage by way of cross-examination.

5.   The Respondent argued that the appeal should  be  dismissed  under  the
    rules and the Appellant should return  to  Pakistan  to  make  a  fresh
    application for entry as a  spouse  of  the  Sponsor.  The  Appellant's
    argument was that she had established a family and private life in  the
    United Kingdom which would be disproportionately interfered with by her
    removal to Pakistan. The Sponsor had the care of his younger brother  Y
    who at the date of the hearing was just 13 years old. Y  lost  his  own
    father in 2006 when he was just 5 years old. After that Y's  uncle  the
    Sponsor treated Y as his own son. The Appellant stated that she  had  a
    close relationship with Y and although they are brother and  sister-in-
    law their relationship was in effect that of stepmother and stepson. It
    was not possible for  the  Sponsor  to  travel  to  Pakistan  with  the
    Appellant while she made an application for  entry  clearance  since  Y
    could not be left on his own. It was not possible for her to go back to
    Pakistan even for a relatively short period to make an application  for
    entry clearance from there because that too would disrupt their  family
    life and interfere with the care of Y.

6.   The Judge accepted that  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  were  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship and did not  hold  it  against  the
    Appellant that the  Respondent  had  only  discovered  the  Appellant's
    second marriage at the date of hearing stating at paragraph 25  of  the
    determination that the Appellant "did  inform  her  solicitors  of  her
    change in circumstances believing that they would tell the  appropriate
    authorities anything they needed to know. There is no legal  obligation
    upon her to tell the Respondent of her change in personal circumstances
    and I find that she did all that could be reasonably  expected  of  her
    bearing in mind the particular circumstances  she  found  herself  in".
    Those circumstances the Judge noted were that the Appellant had come to
    a foreign country with a man she loved and trusted, was left  early  on
    in her marriage and had to find a new home at short notice.

7.   The Judge found that as  the  Appellant  was  married  to  a  different
    Sponsor when she made her application to the Respondent  for  variation
    of leave she  could  not  amend  that  application  by  substituting  a
    different Sponsor. The result was that the Appellant could not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules and her  application  had  to  be  assessed
    outside the Rules under the provisions of article 8 of the Human Rights
    Convention (the right to  respect  for  private  and  family  life)uman
    Rights conventionHhhh. The Judge correctly directed  herself  that  the
    principal issue in the case was the proportionality or otherwise of the
    interference with the  private  and  family  life  established  by  the
    Appellant in this  country  caused  by  the  Respondent's  decision  to
    remove. The concern which I had  about  the  Judges  treatment  of  the
    proportionality exercise at paragraphs 28 and 29 of  the  determination
    was that the Judge had not given  due  weight  to  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant could not succeed under the rules, and appeared  to  overlook
    the provisions of section 117 B (1) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 that the public interest  consideration  applicable  in
    all cases was that the maintenance of effective immigration control was
    in the public interest (notwithstanding that the Judge had specifically
    directed  herself  to  that   provision   at   paragraph   7   of   the
    determination).

The Further Evidence

8.   Given the weight which had to be accorded to the fact that this was  an
    application for leave to remain  outside  the  immigration  rules  some
    compelling reasons were required as to why the public interest would be
    outweighed in this case. See the Court of Appeal decision in  SS  Congo
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387. The findings  made  at  first  instance  that  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting marriage and
    that their joint earnings were considerably  more  than  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix  FM  were  preserved.  What  was  required  to
    complete the proportionality exercise was a proper  assessment  of  the
    best interests of the child Y who on the basis of the findings  of  the
    Judge at first instance would be affected by the decision to remove the
    Appellant and require her to apply for entry clearance from Pakistan. I
    directed at paragraph 6 of my finding of  an  error  of  law  that  the
    Appellant should make an  up-to-date  statement  and  provide  evidence
    perhaps in the form of a letter from Y as to the  relationship  between
    the Appellant and Y.

9.   This further evidence was duly  supplied  in  the  form  of  a  further
    statement of the Appellant dated 3rd of August 2015 and a letter from Y
    of the same date. In her statement the Appellant said she had  strongly
    connected to the Sponsor's family who were very accepting of  her.  She
    had built up strong relationship with her mother-in-law and with Y. She
    was very attached to Y who was a loving child and  they  had  formed  a
    relationship with ease. She  detailed  the  family's  everyday  routine
    including what she did to get Y ready for school  and  what  activities
    the family did together. They had informed Y that the Home  Office  had
    made a decision that the Appellant  should  leave  the  United  Kingdom
    which it upset Y and caused him a great deal of worry. In his letter  Y
    had described how he had a lot of fun with the Appellant who helped him
    with his homework and gave him good advice. He was sad and  upset  that
    the Respondent wanted to return the Appellant to Pakistan and this  was
    having an effect on his schooling.

The Hearing Before Me

10.   The  Appellant  attended  and  formally  adopted  her  statement   and
    indicated that she was also aware of the contents of  Y's  letter.  She
    was not cross examined. In  oral  submissions  the  presenting  officer
    relied on the refusal letter dated 11th of March 2014. This had refused
    the Appellant's application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  the
    spouse of Mr Malik on the grounds that neither  the  Appellant  nor  Mr
    Malik had attended for interview  to  investigate  the  genuineness  or
    otherwise of their relationship.  Very  limited  information  had  been
    supplied regarding the Appellant and Mr Malik's finances. Dealing  with
    the present claim for leave to remain  outside  the  immigration  rules
    because of the marriage to the Sponsor the presenting officer  remarked
    that what had to be considered was the length of time the Appellant had
    been in the United Kingdom which was  just  over  4  years.  She  could
    return to Pakistan where she had lived the majority  of  her  life  and
    make an application from there for entry clearance as the spouse of her
    Sponsor. That would not be a  disproportionate  interference  with  her
    private and family life. This was not a Chikwamba type of case as there
    was no barrier to the Appellant returning to her country of origin.

11.  In reply counsel for the Appellant  relied  on  his  skeleton  argument
    which had quoted extensively from a large number of cases (although not
    SS Congo). In a case where removal is resisted in reliance on Article 8
    the questions for the tribunal to ask were likely to be those as stated
    at paragraph 17  of  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.  The  Appellant  had  an
    established family and private life in  this  country  which  would  be
    interfered with. Pursuant to the duty under section 55 of  the  Borders
    Citizenship and Immigration act 2009,  legislation  and  case  law  the
    interests of minor children affected by the Respondent's decision was a
    primary (although not the primary) consideration for the  tribunal.  It
    had to be considered first. Pursuant to section 117 B (6) of  the  2002
    Act the public interest did not require the Appellant's  removal  where
    as in this  case:  (a)  she  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child (Y is a UK citizen) and (b) it was
    unreasonable to expect Y to leave the United Kingdom.

12.  According to the Respondent's immigration directorate  instructions  on
    the assessment of family life claims the phrase "genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship" went beyond the strict  legal  definition  of  a
    parent to encompass situations in  which  an  applicant  is  playing  a
    genuinely parental role in a child's life whether that  was  recognised
    as a matter of law or not. It would not be reasonable  to  expect  this
    British citizen child Y to leave the United Kingdom. The best interests
    of a child were usually best served by being with both or at least  one
    of their parents and continuity of residence was  important.  Residence
    of over 7 years and whether the child  was  well  integrated  into  the
    educational system were  indicators  that  the  welfare  of  the  child
    favoured regularisation of the status of mother and child.

13.  Further, it was argued, it would rarely be proportionate  to  remove  a
    spouse if there was a close and genuine bond with the other spouse  and
    that other spouse could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  follow  the
    Appellant to the country of removal. In this case it  was  unreasonable
    to expect the Sponsor a British citizen of 29 years of age to relocate.
    He was born here and had home and work commitments including a mortgage
    and close family members who depended on him. The Appellant was able to
    speak  English  (she  had  an  English-language  certificate)  and  was
    financially independent. She was not in the United Kingdom  unlawfully.
    She had had leave since February 2011. The issue of precariousness  was
    not material. The Appellant had not been responsible for the  breakdown
    of her previous marriage and she met the  spirit  of  the  rules.  Only
    comparatively rarely in  family  cases  involving  children  should  an
    Article  8  appeal  be  dismissed  on  the  basis  that  it  would   be
    proportionate and more appropriate for the Appellant to apply for leave
    from abroad. There was no sensible reason why the Appellant  should  be
    required to make an entry clearance application  given  the  disruption
    that this would cause.

14.  In oral submissions counsel argued that the Appellant had an  important
    role in the life of Y who treated her as a mother figure. The issue was
    the proportionality or otherwise of interference. The rules were not  a
    complete code and the fact that the Appellant could not  succeed  under
    the rules was not determinative of the proportionality exercise. It was
    pertinent to note the provisions of section 117 B (6).  The  definition
    of a parent according to the immigration directorate  instructions  was
    certainly wide enough to cover the situation here where  the  Appellant
    had assumed a parental role for Y.  The  tribunal  should  not  make  a
    decision which would cause this family to split up. The test of whether
    the Sponsor could  travel  to  Pakistan  was  not  whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles but rather the reasonableness or otherwise  of
    requiring him to do that. He could not go to live in Pakistan. He would
    lose his job. Had the Appellant's first marriage  subsisted  she  would
    have qualified for indefinite leave to remain on that basis.

15.  The Appellant could be distinguished from someone  such  as  a  tier  4
    student who would have leave in this country in a category  that  would
    not lead to settlement. By contrast the Appellant had leave  to  remain
    in a category that was expected to lead to settlement. The  removal  of
    the Appellant would devastate the family and could not be  made  up  by
    modern means of communication. It was  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
    Appellant to return to Pakistan to apply for entry clearance from there
    as her absence would cause severe disruption. If the Appellant had  had
    some responsibility for the breakdown of her first marriage it might be
    reasonable in those circumstances to argue that she could go  back  and
    apply for entry clearance. However she was innocent of  any  wrongdoing
    and as she otherwise met the requirements of  Appendix  FM  (financial,
    relationship and the English language) the decision to remove  her  was
    disproportionate to the legitimate aim of immigration control.

Findings

16.  It was not argued before me with any force  that  the  Appellant  could
    succeed within the immigration rules. The application she had  made  to
    the Respondent for indefinite leave to remain was on the basis  of  her
    marriage to Mr Malik and her current claim is  therefore  substantively
    different. It represents a fresh application which it is  not  possible
    for her to make whilst  her  first  application  was  outstanding  (see
    section 3C (4) of the Immigration Act 1971). The issue in this case was
    whether the Appellant could succeed outside the  rules.  That  in  turn
    came  down  to  the  issue  of  proportionality.  The   Appellant   has
    established a family life here, it would be interfered with by  removal
    and that interference would be in accordance with the legitimate aim of
    immigration control. In assessing proportionality I  have  to  bear  in
    mind that this is  an  application  outside  the  rules  and  that  the
    maintenance of immigration control is  in  the  public  interest.  Some
    compelling reasons are therefore required as to why the public interest
    in maintaining immigration control should be outweighed in this case.

17.  The evidence in  this  case  shows  that  the  Appellant  has  a  quasi
    maternal relationship with  Y  and  that  that  relationship  would  be
    interfered with by the  Appellant's  removal.  I  do  not  consider  it
    reasonable to expect Y to travel to Pakistan a country to which he  has
    never been. He is a British citizen and is  well  integrated  into  the
    educational system of this country. The disruption caused to  his  life
    by having to travel to Pakistan would not be in his best interests. His
    best interests are no doubt to remain in this country to be  cared  for
    by his uncle who is in loco parentis to him and by the  Appellant.  The
    uncertainty surrounding these proceedings has  had  an  effect  on  the
    child. I do not consider that the Appellant's removal to  Pakistan  for
    the purposes of making an application for entry  clearance  from  there
    would be in the child's best interests either. In my view that would be
    merely to heighten the  uncertainty  and  increase  the  disruption  to
    family life.

18.  As the case law makes clear whilst the child's  best  interests  are  a
    primary consideration they are not paramount. The tribunal must make  a
    decision on the weight to be ascribed to the relevant factors  in  this
    case. On one side of the equation is the fact that the Appellant cannot
    succeed under the immigration rules and therefore seeks  leave  outside
    the rules. On the other side of the scale  is  the  deleterious  effect
    removal will have on the child Y coupled with the  unreasonableness  of
    expecting the Sponsor to give up his employment to travel to  Pakistan.
    There is no public interest to be served in removing the Appellant  who
    has a genuine parental relationship with Y where it is unreasonable  to
    expect  Y  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.  That  of  itself  is   not
    determinative of the appeal as  a  whole  but  when  taken  with  other
    factors such as that the Appellant can meet the other  requirements  of
    Appendix FM (language, income  and  genuineness  of  relationship)  the
    balance comes down  in  favour  of  the  Appellant  remaining  in  this
    country. Notwithstanding therefore the considerable weight  which  must
    be ascribed to the public interest in maintaining immigration  control,
    on balance the other factors in this case which I have  set  out  above
    outweigh the public interest in the circumstances  of  this  particular
    case.  I  accept  the  arguments  put  forward  in  this  case  on  the
    Appellant's behalf that removal would disproportionately interfere with
    the family life enjoyed by all three members of the family. It would be
    a disproportionate  interference  with  the  Appellant's  rights  under
    article 8 to require her to return to Pakistan whether to  relocate  or
    to apply for entry clearance from there.

19.  The Appellant has made a claim that the decision breaches  her  private
    life. In so far as this is a separate claim to her claim  that  removal
    breaches the right to a family life of herself  the  Sponsor  and  Y  I
    would not accept that there was a breach of the Appellant's right to  a
    private life in this country. Here it is relevant to note that she  has
    only been in the United Kingdom some 4 years and has spent the majority
    of her life in Pakistan. She would not be able  to  succeed  under  the
    provisions of paragraph 276 ADE of the immigration rules. There are  no
    factors in her claim to a private life that would outweigh  the  public
    interest in her removal. However as I have found that the  Respondent's
    decision breaches the Appellant's right to a family life, the case does
    not get that far. I therefore allow the appeal under Article 8.

Decision

The decision of the First-Tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have  set  it  aside.  I  remake  the  decision  by  allowing  the
Appellants appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  to  vary
leave.

Appellant's appeal allowed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

For the Appellant:     Mr P. Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr B. Singh of Counsel


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 4  December  1984.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent to refuse her application
    to vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2011 with  entry  clearance  as  a
    spouse valid from 28 January 2011 to 23 April 2013.   At  the  time  of
    entry she was married to a Mr Malik, the marriage having taken place on
    31 August 2005.  In February 2014 after the Appellant  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom she and Mr Malik separated.  She met her current husband
    Mr Ibala Hussian ("the Sponsor") and they married in the United Kingdom
    on 10 September 2014.

2.   On 8 February 2013 the Appellant applied for a variation  of  leave  on
    the basis of her marriage to Mr Malik.   The  Respondent  refused  that
    application on 11 March 2014 and  the  Appellant  lodged  a  notice  of
    appeal on 26 March 2014 against the  Respondent's  decision.   However,
    when the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal on 16 December 2014
    the Appellant indicated that she was  no  longer  proceeding  with  the
    application for leave to remain as the spouse of Mr Malik but rather as
    the spouse of the Sponsor.  The first the Respondent  knew  about  this
    change in the application was on the date of hearing  but  I  was  told
    that at the hearing the Presenting Officer indicated  that  the  matter
    could proceed there and then as the Presenting Officer  would  test  by
    way  of  cross-examination  the  genuineness  or   otherwise   of   the
    Appellant's second marriage.

3.   In the event the Judge found as a fact that  the  Appellant  was  in  a
    genuine and subsisting marriage to the  Sponsor  but  the  case  failed
    under the Rules because this was  not  the  marriage  under  which  the
    Appellant had originally applied.  The Judge proceeded to consider  the
    appeal outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8. The  Judge  found
    that the interference to the Appellant's relationship with the  Sponsor
    would be disproportionately interfered with by requiring her to  return
    to Pakistan and make application for entry clearance from there  or  by
    requiring her to  return  to  relocate  to  Pakistan.   The  Respondent
    appealed that decision, arguing that the Judge had not carried out  the
    proportionality exercise correctly and permission to appeal was granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher on the grounds that while the Judge
    had said she found  exceptional  circumstances  meriting  consideration
    outside the Rules she had failed to explain  what  they  were  and  had
    failed to  adequately  reason  why  Section  117B(1)  and  (2)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applied.

4.   Counsel for the Appellant, who had appeared at first  instance,  argued
    that  the  Judge  had  not  made  a  material  error  of  law  and  the
    determination should stand.  The Judge had  had  Section  117B  in  the
    forefront  of  her  mind.   The  Judge's  reference  to   there   being
    exceptional circumstances which allowed the  appeal  to  be  considered
    outside the Rules was a higher test than required under Gulshan  (which
    only required there to be an arguable case to look at Article 8 outside
    the Rules) but this did not affect the outcome  of  the  decision.   In
    reply the Presenting Officer argued that the  Judge  had  not  properly
    considered the reasonableness or otherwise of requiring  the  Appellant
    to return to obtain leave to enter given that she was in effect  making
    a completely different application to the one originally  submitted  to
    the Respondent. At the end of submissions I indicated that  I  found  a
    material error of law such that the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    should be set aside but with certain findings of fact preserved.

5.   The Judge was  considering  the  Appellant's  application  outside  the
    Rules but it is not apparent from the determination that the Judge gave
    due weight to the fact that the Appellant could not succeed  under  the
    Rules.  Whilst  the  Respondent  was  prepared  to  continue  with  the
    hearing, in effect the Judge became the primary fact-finder and  needed
    to weigh in the balance  at  the  proportionality  stage  the  relevant
    facts.  The Judge found there to be family life between  the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor's younger brother and found that the  Sponsor's  mother
    would have to claim benefits if the Sponsor were to return to  Pakistan
    with the Appellant.  What is not clear, however,  is  what  weight,  if
    any, was given by the Judge to  the  fact  that  this  case  was  being
    considered outside the Immigration Rules.  At paragraph  28  the  Judge
    said that there was no public interest in making  the  Appellant  leave
    the United Kingdom, thereby ignoring  Section  117B(1)  which  provides
    that the maintenance of effective immigration control is in the  public
    interest.  This omission was pointed out  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge who granted permission to appeal.

6.   As the proportionality  exercise  was  not  carried  out  correctly  in
    accordance with statute and current jurisprudence, I indicated  that  I
    found an error of law.  I did not consider that this was an appropriate
    case to remit back to the First-tier to be decided again as  the  fact-
    finding was substantially done by the First-tier.  The findings made by
    the Judge that the Appellant and her second husband are  in  a  genuine
    and subsisting marriage and that their earnings are  considerably  more
    than the financial requirements of Appendix FM are preserved.  What  is
    necessary is further information about  the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor's younger brother and how that will impact in
    the balancing  exercise.   The  Appellant  should  therefore  be  in  a
    position to make an up-to-date statement and provide evidence,  perhaps
    in the form  of  a  letter,  from  the  Sponsor's  brother  as  to  the
    relationship.  Having found an error of law, I set the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal aside and the decision will be remade by the  Upper
    Tribunal on a date to be fixed  when  an  Urdu  interpreter  should  be
    present.
