Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nathan instructed by Duncan Lewis Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the respondent (MS).  A failure to  comply  with
    this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for  convenience,
    I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Libya who was born on 10 February 1990.

 4. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  on  30  October  2013  and
    claimed asylum.  The basis of his claim was that he  had  been  working
    for the Gaddafi regime in the Internal Security  Service  ("ISA")  from
    the beginning of 2010 until October 2011.  Between March and June 2011,
    the appellant had written reports on six individuals: four students and
    a lecturer (whilst he was himself a  student)  and  also  a  neighbour.
    Those individuals  were  subsequently  arrested  and  detained  by  the
    security services.  Following that, the appellant worked  for  about  a
    month at checkpoints, checking and searching cars and passengers.  Then
    he had worked in the Jdeida Prison.   The  appellant  claimed  to  fear
    arrest, imprisonment and torture if he returned to Libya by  those  who
    would want revenge against him due to his former work with the  Gaddafi
    regime.

 5. On 28 May 2019, the Secretary of State refused the  appellant's  claims
    for asylum, humanitarian protection and under the  European  Convention
    on Human Rights.

 6. The Secretary of State accepted that the appellant would  be  at  risk,
    and that it would breach Art 3 of the ECHR, if he  returned  to  Libya.
    However, the Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  the  appellant  was
    excluded from the Refugee Convention and from  humanitarian  protection
    because Art 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention applied.  The Secretary  of
    State was satisfied that the appellant's  activities  for  the  Gaddafi
    regime amounted to aiding and abetting crimes against humanity contrary
    to Art 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal  Court  (the
    "ICC").  The Secretary of State relied upon  background  evidence  that
    the Gaddafi regime engaged in widespread or systematic attacks directed
    against the civilian population, namely  by  detaining,  torturing  and
    killing (in particular  by  the  ISA)  opponents  of  the  regime  with
    particular reference to the period leading up to the Libyan  Revolution
    in  2011.   The  Secretary  of  State  concluded  that,   despite   the
    appellant's statements to the contrary, he had knowledge of the  abuses
    carried out by the ISA and the Gaddafi regime.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   It  was  accepted
    before Judge O'Rourke, that the appellant was  at  risk  on  return  to
    Libya.  However, Judge O'Rourke found that the Secretary of  State  had
    not established that there were "serious reasons" for considering  that
    the appellant had aided and abetted  crimes  against  humanity.   Judge
    O'Rourke accepted, as credible, the appellant's evidence in relation to
    his involvement with the ISA (which he joined essentially for patriotic
    reasons) and that he had no knowledge of the abuses, relied upon by the
    Secretary of State being carried out by the ISA or  more  generally  by
    the Gaddafi regime.  In addition, the judge found that, the information
    that the appellant passed on could at  least  theoretically  have  been
    provided for the purpose of both lawful and unlawful  activities,  that
    was unlikely to amount to  "aiding  and  abetting"  the  commission  of
    international crimes by the regime.

 8. As a consequence, the judge allowed the appellant's  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 9. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on two grounds.

10. Ground 1 challenges the judge's credibility finding in  favour  of  the
    appellant.  In essence, that ground contends  that  the  judge  reached
    that finding wrongly treating the  expert  opinion  (of  Dr  Joffe)  as
    determinative and failed to reach the finding by  taking  into  account
    the background evidence concerning the  abuses  and  brutality  of  the
    Gaddafi regime.  The ground asserts that it was impossible to  conceive
    how the appellant would not have known about the use of  torture  given
    his circumstances and the background evidence.

11. Ground 2 argues that the judge erred in finding  that  the  appellant's
    activities could not amount to "aiding and abetting" the  international
    crime in passing on the identity and activities of those upon  whom  he
    informed.

12. On 9 October 2019, the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Loke)  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal.

13. On 14 November 2019, the appellant filed a rule 24 response seeking  to
    uphold the judge's decision.

The Law

14. Before me, with one exception in Ground 2, it was  not  contended  that
    Judge O'Rourke had misunderstood or  misapplied  the  applicable  legal
    framework under Art 1F(a) of the  Refugee  Convention.   That  provides
    that:

         "1(F) The provisions of this Convention  shall  not  apply  to  any
         person  with  respect  to  whom  there  are  serious  reasons   for
         considering that:

         (a)  he has committed a crime against peace,  a  war  crime,  or  a
             crime  against  humanity,  as  defined  in  the  international
             instruments drawn up to make provisions  in  respect  of  such
             crimes; ..."

15. In applying that provision, as Judge O'Rourke  did,  the  international
    criminal law provisions in the Rome Statute of  the  ICC  were  crucial
    (see JS (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 15).  In particular, Art 7  sets
    out the definition of "crimes against humanity" as  including,  murder,
    imprisonment or other severe deprivation of  liberty  in  violation  of
    fundamental rules of community, enforced disappearance of persons,  and
    other inhumane acts of similar character  intentionally  causing  great
    suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.

16. It was not in dispute before me that the background  evidence  relating
    to the workings of  the  Gaddafi  regime,  including  the  ISA  at  the
    relevant time when the appellant was working for  the  ISA  in  2010  -
    2011, involved the commission of acts falling within the definition  of
    'crimes against humanity'.

17. Article 25 of the Rome Statute sets out the circumstances  in  which  a
    person shall be "criminally responsible" for a crime, such as that  set
    out in Art 7 of the Rome Statute.  Suffice it to say, for the  purposes
    of this appeal, "criminal responsibility"  includes  those  individuals
    who commit such a crime, whether  as  an  individual  or  jointly  with
    another; facilitate  the  commission  of  crime,  or  aids,  abets,  or
    otherwise assists in the commission of the offence or in any other  way
    contributes in a significant way to the commission of that offence by a
    group of persons acting with a common purpose and that contribution  is
    made intentionally either with the purpose of furthering  the  criminal
    activity or purpose of the group or is made with the knowledge  of  the
    intention of the group to commit the offence (see MT (Article  1F(a)  -
    aiding and abetting) Zimbabwe [2012] UKUT 00015 (IAC)).

18. It is also common ground that the Secretary of State has the burden  of
    proving that there are "serious reasons" to consider that the appellant
    was, applying those provisions, guilty of  a  crime  against  humanity.
    That  requirement  is  stronger  than  a   requirement   to   establish
    "reasonable grounds" and that any evidence must be "clear and credible"
    or "strong" (see Al-Sirri v SSHD [2012] UKSC 54 at [75]).

19. Further, it was common ground that the  appellant  had  not  personally
    carried out any acts which amounted to crimes  against  humanity.   The
    Secretary of State's case against him was that his actions, in  passing
    on reports, with the knowledge of what was likely to happen to  anybody
    who was detained as a consequence,  amounted  to  aiding  and  abetting
    crimes against humanity.  Apart from the point raised in ground  2,  it
    was common ground that  the  issue  turned  upon  whether  the  judge's
    credibility  finding  in  relation  to  the   appellant   was   legally
    sustainable such that the Secretary of State  had,  as  a  consequence,
    failed to establish that the appellant had  knowledge  of  the  Gaddafi
    regime's abuses.

20. During the hearing I enquired from Mr Howells whether the Secretary  of
    State's position was that the appellant was  guilty  as  an  aider  and
    abettor  of  a  crime  against  humanity  committed  against  the   six
    individuals upon whom he had informed and who had  been  detained.   Mr
    Howells indicated that that was not the Secretary of State's  case  and
    he accepted that there was no evidence that any  of  those  individuals
    had, in fact, been subjected to any torture or like abuse  which  could
    be  described  as  a  crime  against  humanity.   Instead,  Mr  Howells
    indicated that the Secretary of State's case was that  the  appellant's
    involvement, as an informer, was of such a nature that it  amounted  to
    practical assistance  or  contribution  to  the  commission  of  crimes
    against humanity more generally.  That is, indeed, consistent with  the
    way in which the respondent dealt with the exclusion in paras 88  -  96
    of the refusal decision.

21. Whichever way the appellant's participation as an aider and abettor  is
    framed, in this appeal the crucial issue was whether he  had  knowledge
    of the abuses - the crimes against humanity - which were perpetrated by
    the Gaddafi regime and,  as  accepted,  documented  in  the  background
    material.

Discussion

22. With those matters in mind, I now turn to Ground 1 and the Secretary of
    State's challenge to  the  judge's  positive  credibility  finding  and
    conclusion that he accepted the appellant's evidence that the appellant
    did not have knowledge of the  abuses  which  the  Secretary  of  State
    relies upon as being carried out by the Gaddafi regime at the  relevant
    time.

23. At the centre of the appellant's case before the judge was a report  of
    Dr Joffe.  With one exception, the judge accepted Dr Joffe's conclusion
    in that report.  The judge summarised the report  at  para  25  of  his
    determination as follows:

         "25. Expert Evidence.  I summarise  the  main  relevant  points  of
             Professor  Joff�'s  report  [App  C],  using   its   paragraph
             numbering as follows:

             i.   He is a widely-published and acknowledged expert on Libya
                  [1-3].

             ii.  There are reports that the regime in  Jdeida  prison  did
                  not ill-treat or torture prisoners [10].

             iii.     The  Appellant's  tribal  background  (the  Warfalla,
                  heavily associated with the  Gaddafi  regime)  is  also  a
                  factor in his fear of return [11 and 48].

             iv.   There  is  still  profound  instability  in  Libya   and
                  supporters of the Gaddafi regime continue to be persecuted
                  [18 and 71(iii)].

             v.   The regime (until  its  downfall)  was  all-powerful  and
                  controlling of the mechanisms of state.  The  ideology  of
                  the Green Book was a  key  school  test  that  had  to  be
                  studied from the end of primary school.  The  regime  also
                  went to  considerable  efforts  to  exclude  knowledge  of
                  information that might criticise it and supporters  simply
                  considered  that  any  such  criticism   was   anti-regime
                  propaganda.  Arrests  and  detention  of  critics  of  the
                  regime were justified as protection against terrorists and
                  religious extremists.  Any failure by servicemen  to  obey
                  orders would be dealt with most severely [71(iv)]."

24. Then at para 26, the judge reached the following conclusions in respect
    of Dr Joff�'s report:

         "26. Conclusions on Expert  Evidence  in  relation  to  Appellant's
             Account.  I conclude the following:

             i.   The Appellant's  account  of  having  been  raised  in  a
                  dictatorial state and being effectively  'brainwashed'  by
                  propaganda into seeing no fault (and indeed a lot of good)
                  in the regime is entirely plausible.

             ii.  Similarly, for the same reasons and also his  then  young
                  age and relative immaturity, it is plausible that he  will
                  not have perceived the regime as acting unlawfully towards
                  opponents and detainees,  but  instead  merely  protecting
                  itself against 'terrorists' and religious fundamentalists,
                  out to destroy it.

             iii. In that  context,  'signing  up',  to  help  protect  his
                  country against such perceived  threats  will,  plausibly,
                  have seemed like the patriotic  (and  potentially  career-
                  enhancing) thing to do.

             iv.  The Appellant will  be  under  personal  (as  opposed  to
                  indiscriminate Article 15(c))  threat,  from  now-dominant
                  militias, due to his involvement with the  regime,  tribal
                  membership and informing on suspects.

             v.   While I generally give  due  weight  to  Profess  Joff�'s
                  report, as to the above issues, I comment that he does, as
                  Ms Rawlings [the Presenting Officer] correctly points out,
                  exceed his remit in paragraph 71(i),  where  he  seeks  to
                  come to an apparent juridical view on the applicability of
                  Article 1(F) to the Appellant's circumstances.  He has not
                  heard evidence on the facts in this matter, is  not  in  a
                  position to come to findings in respect of them, or of the
                  application of the law to those facts.  That is  the  role
                  of this Tribunal and not that of an expert.   Nonetheless,
                  I don't consider this error on his part to  undermine  the
                  main thrust of his report, as to the background context in
                  Libya, in relation to the  Appellant's  circumstances  and
                  which, frankly,  is  readily  available  from  open-source
                  objective evidence and from judicial notice of  historical
                  events in Libya."

25. In a very detailed para 27 of his determination, the judge reached  the
    following conclusions on the application of Art 1F(a) to the appellant:

         "27. Application of Article 1F.  I find that the exclusion from the
             applicability of the Refugee  Convention  to  the  Appellant's
             circumstances, contained in Article 1F, is not engaged in this
             appeal, for the following reasons:

             i.   Credibility.  I found the Appellant a  credible  witness,
                  for the following reasons:

                  a.   His account, over three interviews  in  a  three-year
                      period and  now  in  evidence  at  this  Hearing  was
                      entirely internally consistent.

                  b.   His evidence is also externally consistent, both with
                      background and expert evidence.

                  c.   I did not consider it implausible that a  young  man,
                      barely out of his teens and having been brought up in
                      a dictatorial regime and subject  to  propaganda  all
                      his life, would  consider,  at  the  time,  that  the
                      Gaddafi regime was a force for good  for  the  Libyan
                      people and that by joining the security  services  he
                      was doing his patriotic duty.

             ii.  I remind myself that the burden of proof in this  respect
                  rests on the Respondent and I  don't  consider  that  they
                  have discharged that burden, for the following reasons:

                  a.   I had no reason to doubt the Appellant's account  and
                      in particular, bearing in mind his age  and  no-doubt
                      indoctrinated education, his state  of  knowledge  of
                      the true extent of the evils of the  regime.   While,
                      as the  Respondent  would  argue,  they  'assume'  or
                      'perceive' a high level of knowledge on his part that
                      is nothing like sufficient to meet  the  test  in  JS
                      that:

                       'because of the serious consequences of exclusion for
                      the person concerned the article must be  interpreted
                      restrictively and used cautiously; and (iv) that more
                      than mere membership of an organisation is  necessary
                      to  bring  an   individual   within   the   article's
                      disqualifying provisions'.

                       The Appellant's evidence was not shaken on the extent
                      of his involvement with  the  security  services,  or
                      state of knowledge of  the  regime's  activities  and
                      therefore, in the absence of compelling  evidence  to
                      the contrary, I accept it.

                  b.    Dealing  with  the  questions  raised  in   JS,   in
                      consideration  of  the  factors  applicable  to   the
                      application of Article 1F, I find as follows:

                      (1)  There is  no  doubt  that  the  former  security
                           service would have been a large and  intimidating
                           organisation.  The part of the Appellant seems to
                           have been concerned with was that of information-
                           gathering, rather than  say,  the  more  'direct'
                           aspects of arrests, detention or interrogation.

                      (2)  The organisation was not proscribed  and  indeed
                           was a central part of the regime  and  protecting
                           its interests.

                      (3)  The Appellant volunteered for is role, in, as  I
                           have found, a na�ve view that he was serving  his
                           country and people.

                      (4)  His service was relatively brief and  until  the
                           regime began to crumble, he  would  have  had  no
                           realistic opportunity to  leave  it,  as  had  he
                           deserted before the collapse of  the  regime,  he
                           could no doubt have  been  located  and  severely
                           punished.

                      (5)  His rank, standing and  influence  was  minimal.
                           He was merely one of very many informers  in  the
                           regime  and  I  note,  in   this   respect,   the
                           Respondent's reference to potentially 10  to  20%
                           of the population being such.   While  that  does
                           not excuse his actions, it puts  them  into  some
                           reasonable context.  By way of contrast,  I  take
                           judicial notice of the widely-reported incidence,
                           in the former East Germany, of informing on other
                           citizens to the Stasi, estimated by many  to  run
                           to over a million  citizens,  which,  in  regimes
                           such as that becomes routine and perceived as the
                           duty of 'loyal' citizens.   Very  many  of  those
                           persons will now  be  carrying  on  their  lives,
                           uninterrupted, in Germany.

                      (6)  I accepted his evidence of his lack of awareness
                           of any war  crimes/crimes  against  humanity  and
                           that he believed those he reported  on  would  be
                           dealt with lawfully.

                      (7)  There is no evidence  that  he  engaged  in  any
                           other potentially criminal activity.

                  c.   Applying Al-Sirri, there is nothing like the  'strong
                      or  clear  and  credible   evidence'   necessary   to
                      establish the 'serious  reasons'  necessary  to  find
                      that that Appellant had individual responsibility for
                      acts engaging Article 1F.

                  d.   I consider that Article 33 of  the  Rome  Statute  is
                      engaged, in that it was  unchallenged  evidence  that
                      the Appellant was under a legal  obligation  to  obey
                      lawful orders; that he did not know that those orders
                      were  unlawful  and  that  such   orders   were   not
                      manifestly unlawful.

                  e.   Finally, applying Peri?i? (with consideration  of  MT
                      (Article  1F),  the  information  the  Appellant  was
                      passing on, could, at least theoretically, have  been
                      provided for the purpose of both lawful and  unlawful
                      activities and therefore is unlikely, of  itself,  to
                      amount to 'aiding and  abetting'  the  commission  of
                      crimes, for which alleged crimes there  is,  in  this
                      appeal, in  any  event,  no  strong,  clear  credible
                      evidence."

26. Mr Howells submitted that the judge had treated Dr  Joff�'s  report  as
    determinative of the appellant's credibility and, linked to  that,  had
    failed to take into account the background  evidence  set  out  in  the
    refusal letter attesting to the abuses etc. by the Gaddafi regime.   He
    drew particular attention to para 27(i)(b) of the judge's reason where,
    Mr Howells submitted, the judge had wrongly stated that the appellant's
    evidence  was  "consistent,  both  with  the  background   and   expert
    evidence".  He submitted that it was not consistent with the background
    evidence.

27. I do not accept Mr Howells' submission that the judge  blindly  applied
    the opinion of Dr Joff� without reference to any other evidence.  It is
    plain from para 22 of the judge's decision,  where  he  summarised  the
    refusal decision, that he had well in mind  the  Secretary  of  State's
    case, in particular that the appellant's claim that he had no knowledge
    of  the  abuses  by  the  Gaddafi  regime  was  inconsistent  with  the
    background evidence.  It is helpful to set out para 22 of  the  judge's
    determination which is in the following terms:

         "22. The refusal  is  very  detailed,  but  I  summarise  its  main
             conclusions as follows:

             i.   The Gaddafi regime was authoritarian in nature and  human
                  rights abuses were widespread.  Details of  such  activity
                  are provided in  paragraphs  18  to  49.   Prisoners  were
                  frequently subject to arbitrary  detention  and  routinely
                  tortured and  mistreated.   Jdeida  prison  was  one  such
                  detention facility.

             ii.  Anybody suspected of any opposition to the  regime  could
                  be subject to arrest, or worse.   The  regime  oversaw  an
                  extensive  network  of  informants,  with   one   observer
                  estimating that 10 to 20% of the population was engaged in
                  surveillance [para. 42].

             iii. As the regime came under greater threat,  the  oppression
                  and  killings  increased.   The  security  services   were
                  heavily involved in such activities.  There  are  accounts
                  of  persons  being  mistreated,  detained,  or  worse,  at
                  military/security forces' checkpoints.

             iv.  The nature of the above-mentioned abuses engages  Article
                  25 of the Rome Statute, by commission  of  crimes  against
                  humanity.

             v.   It is believed that the Appellant,  'made  a  substantial
                  contribution to the ability of the  Libyan  government  to
                  commit these abuses and crimes' and that  'the  activities
                  (he) had undertaken for the ISA  during  the  period  from
                  early 2010 to August 2011 in perceived full  knowledge  of
                  how (the  regime)  ...  treated  those  considered  to  be
                  opposed to the regime.' [para. 86].

             vi.  That, applying MT (Article 1F(a) - aiding and  abetting),
                  he had provided 'practical assistance to the commission of
                  crimes against  humanity  by  the  ISA',  his  role  being
                  fundamental to identifying and targeting its opponents.

             vii. His account of being unaware of the abuses  committed  by
                  the regime and his supposition that those he had  informed
                  on, who he saw in prison, had not been tortured,  was  not
                  accepted and it is the case that he is merely  seeking  to
                  distance himself from such acts."

28. The Secretary of State's position is again recorded in the  submissions
    of the Presenting Officer at para 23 of the judge's determination.

29. The judge did not explain at para 27(i)(b) why the appellant's evidence
    was consistent with "background ... evidence".  The material is set out
    at paras 17-77 of the refusal decision.  I do not consider it necessary
    to set it out.  The judge's summary, though relatively brief,  captures
    its essence.  That  evidence  does  not  state  that  the  abuses  were
    necessarily known by Libyan citizens or, indeed, by everyone who worked
    for the Gaddafi regime.

30. This was a case  where  the  judge  had  an  opportunity  to  hear  the
    appellant give evidence and I am wholly unpersuaded  that  in  reaching
    his positive credibility finding he  ignored  the  background  evidence
    concerning the abuses carried out by the  Gaddafi  regime.   Here,  the
    judge had evidence from the appellant as to his  involvement  with  the
    ISA.  He worked for a short time making reports (whilst a student)  and
    then acted as a guard at checkpoints  and  worked  in  a  prison.   His
    evidence was that he had not seen any abuses in his work.   Indeed,  as
    Mr Nathan pointed out, his evidence was that he had seen  a  number  of
    the people upon whom he had informed subsequently, either in prison  or
    after their release unharmed.  The judge had to assess the plausibility
    of the appellant's account that, having joined the ISA as a  young  man
    with patriotic aims, he was not to be believed that  he  did  not  know
    about the abuses.

31. Mr Howells sought to argue that Dr Joff�'s report (at page 24) did  not
    support the judge's conclusion.  Both relied upon  it  being  plausible
    that regime supporters denied the evidence of such crimes or  took  the
    view that they were justified as a necessary response to the  hostility
    towards the Gaddafi regime in 2011.  The appellant's evidence was  that
    he fell into the former category.  There is no basis, in  my  judgment,
    for the  claim  in  the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  that,  it  is
    inconceivable that the appellant would not have known about the use  of
    torture generally.  On the basis of Dr Joff�'s report,  it  is  plainly
    conceivable.  The appellant's case was, throughout, consistent  on  his
    lack of knowledge.   It  has  not  been  suggested  that  he  has  ever
    participated  in  or  been  a  witness  to  any  abuses  himself.   The
    appellant's own evidence was that he had never seen any abuse in any of
    the roles he played in the ISA and, indeed, he had  seen  a  number  of
    those upon whom he had informed without any signs of torture etc.

32. The  background  evidence  did  not  drive  the  judge  to  reject  the
    appellant's evidence as incredible.  In my judgment, he had it well  in
    mind when reaching his positive credibility finding.  It  is  important
    to bear in mind that the Secretary of State bore the burden of  proving
    that there were "serious reasons" for considering  that  the  appellant
    had, as an aider and abetter, committed crimes  against  humanity.   Dr
    Joff�'s report was supportive of the appellant's claim that he did not,
    in fact, have the guilty  knowledge  required  for  that  international
    crime.

33. In those circumstances,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge  reached  a
    rational finding for sustainable reasons that the appellant was  to  be
    believed and that, as a result, it had not been established that  there
    were "serious reasons" to consider  that  he  was  guilty  of  a  crime
    against humanity through his involvement in the ISA  between  2010  and
    2011. The judge  was  entitled  to  reject  the  Secretary  of  State's
    reliance on Art 1F(a) and to allow the  appellant's  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds.

34. Given that conclusion, it is unnecessary to explore  the  Secretary  of
    State's  second  ground  of  appeal  which   challenges   the   judge's
    alternative reason for concluding that Art 1F(a) did not apply in  para
    27(ii)(e) that the appellant's involvement could not amount, in  itself
    to "aiding and abetting".  There was considerable discussion during the
    respective submissions of the parties as to what level  of  involvement
    could amount to "aiding and abetting".  The point is not  without  some
    difficulty.  The judge's finding in para  27(ii)(e)  is  not,  however,
    material to his decision that Art 1F(a) does not  apply.   Without  the
    requisite knowledge, Art 1F(a) did not apply even  if  the  appellant's
    involvement, as an informer, was sufficient to amount  to  'aiding  and
    abetting'.  In  those  circumstances,  it  is  unnecessary  to  resolve
    whether the judge's conclusion in para 27(ii)(e) was correct.

35. For the above reasons, therefore, Judge O'Rourke did not materially err
    in law in allowing the appellant's appeal  on  asylum  grounds  on  the
    basis that Art 1F(a) did not apply to the appellant.

Decision

36. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    on asylum and humanitarian  protection  grounds  did  not  involve  the
    making of a material error of law.  That decision stands.

37. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.
