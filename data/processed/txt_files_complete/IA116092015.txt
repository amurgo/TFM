                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge S Aziz, promulgated on 23rd March 2016, following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 14th March  2016.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of the Appellant whereupon the Respondent  Secretary
    of State applied for, and was granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Albania, who  was  born  on  20
    January 1987.  She appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State refusing her application for an EEA  residence  card
    on the basis of her marriage  to  a  Polish  national,  Mr  [WC].   Her
    application on 21st October 2014 was on the basis that she should  have
    a permanent residence card on the basis that she had a  retained  right
    of residence, following her divorce from Mr [WC],  but  by  a  decision
    dated 11th March 2015, this application was rejected.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge had regard to the case of Begum (EEA -  worker  -  jobseeker)
    Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00275 which established that any  employment  must
    be "meaningful", and although in this case the  Appellant  was  earning
    �54 per week, the judge held that the Tribunal is entitled to  look  at
    whether the Appellant was pursuing effective and genuine activities and
    that, "It cannot reasonably argue that such employment had no  economic
    value" because "�54 a week is still comparable to  the  income  support
    level for a single person for a week  during  this  period"  (paragraph
    38).

 4. The judge went on to hold that the appellant met the requirements of  a
    retained right of residence under EEA Regulations (10/).

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that the judge was wrong  to  conclude
    that the Appellant had a retained right of residence when  tax  returns
    for the Sponsor ought to have shown that the amount he  earned  in  the
    year was not over a continuous period and would not have been earned at
    the date of the divorce.  Furthermore, it was contended that the  judge
    had made no findings  in  respect  of  Regulation  10(6)  of  the  2006
    Regulations on the basis that the Sponsor would, if  she  were  an  EEA
    national, be a worker or self-employed person or self-sufficient person
    under Regulation 6.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted on 16th August 2016.

 7. The Appellant also cross-appealed.

The Hearing

 8. At the hearing before me on 3rd October 2016, Mr Whitwell, appearing on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State relied upon the Grounds  of
    Appeal.  He submitted  that  there  had  been  no  finding  made  under
    Regulation 10(5).  The judge had before her copies of  the  Appellant's
    former partner's HMRC online tax self-assessment forms for 2011 to 2012
    and from 2012 to 2013 (see  paragraph  12).   It  was  the  Appellant's
    former partner who had  completed  these  forms  (paragraph  13).   The
    Appellant accepted that these  tax  returns  established  that  in  the
    financial year 2011 to 2012 her former husband had  informed  the  HMRC
    that he earned �3,650 for that year.  For the financial  year  2012  to
    2013, he had informed the HMRC  that  he  earned  �2,850.   Her  former
    husband had no other form of employment during this  period  (paragraph
    14).  The Appellant also accepted that the sums of  �3,650  and  �2,850
    were modest levels of income, but the explanation given  was  that  she
    was at the time living with her brothers and their overheads were  very
    low and she was self-sufficient  and  did  not  rely  upon  her  former
    husband, and they did not go out and the food they ate  was  cooked  at
    home (paragraph 15).  Mr Whitwell submitted that this still  left  open
    an issue as to whether there were tax returns for 2010 to 2012 and this
    matter had not been dealt with by the judge.

 9. For her part, Ms Horvath submitted that it was never in issue that  the
    Appellant's ex-husband was exercising treaty rights  because  this  was
    not raised in the refusal letter and  there  was  substantial  evidence
    before the judge, such that it was not raised before the judge  either.
    Initially the Respondent had argued that the amounts  earned  were  not
    enough, but given that the judge had stated at paragraph  36  that  the
    Appellant was pursuing effective and genuine activities, the Respondent
    had now changed tack and was now  arguing  that  the  Sponsor  was  not
    working at all.  However, pages 35 to 36 of the  determination  confirm
    the  judge's  findings  that  the  Appellant  was  gainfully  employed.
    Although the Respondent was now withdrawing the suggestion that �54 was
    not enough, given the judge's findings that, "It cannot  reasonably  be
    argued that such employment had no economic value" (paragraph 38),  the
    fact was that there was ample evidence in the  Appellant's  bundle  (at
    pages 51 to 52) confirming that employment was being carried out.

10. In reply, Mr Whitwell referred to a skeleton argument before the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge (at paragraphs 13 to 14), where it  is  said  that,
    "The Appellant is not an EEA national but would be a worker if she were
    an EEA national.  The Appellant has worked as per of  the  table  below
    from the divorce to date.  As such she satisfies the Regulations"  (see
    paragraph 14).  He submitted that the issue was a  germane  one  before
    the judge.  Ms Horvath interrupted to say that this was not  a  finding
    for the judge to make given the circumstances of the case.

11. With respect to a  cross  appeal,  Ms  Horvath  made  two  submissions.
    First, that the judge was wrong to conclude that the Appellant was  not
    entitled to permanent  residence.   Second,  the  judge  came  to  this
    conclusion wrongly on the basis of the suggestion at paragraph 29 that,



         "The Appellant cannot provide evidence that her former husband  had
         full medical insurance when he had been a  student  in  the  United
         Kingdom (this prior to  him  taking  up  self-employment  in  April
         2010).  The Appellant's appeal for  permanent  residence  therefore
         cannot succeed".

12. Ms Horvath submitted that  it  was  correct  the  Appellant  could  not
    provide evidence of comprehensive sickness insurance at the time her ex-
    husband was a student.  However, the submission made at the hearing was
    that this was irrelevant to the appeal as  the  Appellant's  ex-husband
    had been working as a decorator since 10th April 2010, as  accepted  by
    the judge at paragraph 31 and as such the  five  years  ran  from  10th
    April 2010 and the issue of the Appellant's ex-husband was not relevant
    either to the issue of the retained rights or permanent residence.

Consideration of Appeal

13. The key issue in this appeal was whether the Appellant's former partner
    was exercising treaty rights at the dissolution of his marriage on 30th
    August 2012.  Regulation 5(d)(1) was satisfied  because  the  Appellant
    married her ex-husband on 27th August 2008 and the couple then divorced
    on 30th August 2012, and they had lived  in  a  marriage  together  for
    three years.  The Appellant satisfied the immigration Regulations  from
    11th May 2010 until 11th May 2015.  It was also  significant  that  the
    judge  accepted  that  the  Appellant's  ex-husband  was  working   (at
    paragraph 32) when he observed that, "I am prepared to accept that  the
    Appellant's former husband was self-employed as a decorator from  April
    2010 until the dissolution of the marriage some  two  years  later.   I
    take no issue with the evidence relied on".   The  Appellant  was  also
    working from before the dissolution of  the  marriage,  and  what  this
    means is that  the  Appellant  was  residing  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations for a five year period.  The judge ought  to  have  allowed
    the appeal on the basis of Regulation 15 on this basis.  If  the  judge
    was to find lawful residence on the part of the Appellant in excess  of
    five years, then Regulation 15 stood  to  be  applied  and  the  appeal
    should have been allowed on this basis.  The judge was also entitled to
    conclude as he did at paragraphs 35 to 38.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
Tribunal Judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is  allowed
under Regulation 15(1) of the EEA Regulations  2006  and  the  Appellant  is
entitled to a permanent residence card.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have decided to make a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may  be
payable.
