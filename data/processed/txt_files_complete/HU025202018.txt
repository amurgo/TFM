Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Antony [W], Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of  Thailand  born  on  9  July  1986.   She
    appeals against the decision of Judge Mailer promulgated on 26 February
    2019 dismissing her appeal against a decision of the  respondent  dated
    29 November 2017 refusing her application for entry clearance submitted
    in April 2017.

 2. The appellant is  married  to  Antony  [W],  a  British  citizen  ("the
    sponsor").   She  applied  for  entry  clearance  under   the   partner
    provisions of Appendix FM.  Judge Mailer dismissed the  appeal  on  the
    basis that the financial requirements were not met.

 3. This matter has a detailed history.  The appellant's appeal against the
    respondent's decision was originally dismissed by  Judge  Roots  on  20
    August 2018, again on the basis that the financial requirements of  the
    Rules were not met.  That decision was later reviewed by Resident Judge
    Phillips of the First-tier Tribunal, on the basis that  the  supporting
    financial documents which had been provided by the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor to demonstrate the sponsor's income had not been placed  before
    the judge.  As such the decision was  set  aside  and  reheard  on  the
    papers by Judge Mailer.

 4. Before Judge Mailer  there  were  clearly  some  documents,  but  which
    documents is not  entirely  clear.   Judge  Mailer  did  not  list  the
    documents submitted, although  referred  to  various  of  them.   Judge
    Mailer held that there was insufficient evidence  to  demonstrate  that
    the financial requirements were not met, in  particular  the  sponsor's
    self-employed income as declared to HMRC for the relevant year was  for
    �16,090 rather than the minimum which was �18,600.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted to the Upper  Tribunal  on  the  basis
    that Judge Mailer had failed to have regard to the  relevant  documents
    that were submitted.  It appears that there may have been a  repeat  of
    the administrative error which beset Judge Roots'  decision.   The  key
    issue for my consideration is which documents  were  submitted  to  the
    judge below, and  if  they  were  submitted  could  they  have  made  a
    difference.

 6. Before me Mr Tarlow said that he was without a file on the part of  the
    respondent and he did not have a copy of the appellant's  bundle.   His
    submission was that the matter should remain in my hands.

Discussion

 7. The Entry Clearance Review Manager listed the series of documents which
    had been submitted as part of the appeal, and that  list  is  the  only
    record of the documents which appear to have been provided to the First-
    tier Tribunal.  Those documents should have been sent separately to the
    respondent and to the tribunal.  The documents  listed  by  the  review
    manager (in the form the list appears in the review) were as follows:

         Starts

         a. IAFT-6

         b. Notice of refusal

         c. Grounds of appeal

         d. 2016/2017 year end accounts

         e. Extract of online tax return; 90% completed

         f. Letter dated 11/1/2018 x 2

         g. Evidence of the pension entitlement (sponsor's parents)

         h. Evidence of attendance allowance

         Ends

 8. The sponsor maintains that the above documents, in addition to his bank
    statements, were submitted to the First-tier  Tribunal.   He  explained
    that he uses his personal current account  for  everyday  use,  and  to
    manage his business as a sole trader.  However, having  considered  the
    tribunal's file in detail, there appears to have been no record of  the
    bank statements having been linked to  the  file  placed  before  Judge
    Mailer.  The sponsor subsequently provided further copies, ahead of the
    first hearing before me (the postmark on the cover envelope  post-dated
    Judge Mailer's decision on the papers).  There was no other  record  of
    those documents on the Tribunal's file.

 9. Before me, the  sponsor  (who  represented  the  appellant  in  person)
    submitted in clear and cogent terms that the bank statements  had  been
    provided  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  ahead  of  the  matter   being
    considered by Judge Mailer, which had not been provided to  the  judge.
    He also stated that he wrote to request an oral hearing, but  that  the
    matter proceeded on the papers with no explanation as to why he had not
    been able to attend in person to present his wife's case.

10. In my view, in light of the clear confusion which has beset  this  case
    on a previous occasion and given the lack of clarity which results from
    the respondent not being in possession of his file or the bundle, I  am
    prepared to give the sponsor the benefit of the doubt.   I  accept  the
    submissions  made  by  the  sponsor  that  there  were  documents,   in
    particular his personal bank statements, that had been provided to  the
    First-tier Tribunal which had not been considered by the judge.   I  am
    also prepared to accept that, in providing those documents, he may have
    requested an oral hearing.

11. Included in the missing documents  were  the  sponsor's  personal  bank
    statements that, he contended, demonstrated that his earnings from self-
    employment exceeded the minimum income threshold.

12. At [23], Judge Mailer stated that no bank statements had been  provided
    to the Entry Clearance Review manager by the appellant.   At  [24],  he
    concluded that the required specified evidence had not been provided.

13. As such, I find that there was an error of law in the decision of Judge
    Mailer dated 26 February 2019.  Through no  fault  of  the  judge,  the
    sponsor's personal bank statements which appear to have  been  sent  by
    the appellant and sponsor to the tribunal had not  been  placed  before
    him when he considered the case on the papers.  I stress that there  is
    absolutely no error on the face of the judge's decision itself.  It  is
    a model of a decision on the papers.  However, the wider  circumstances
    meant that the decision involved the making of an error of law.

14. Having considered the statements the sponsor said he submitted but were
    not considered, it is clear that they do record a degree  of  financial
    activity which may, had they been considered, have  led  the  judge  to
    reach a different decision.   Given  the  procedural  history  of  this
    matter, and given the sponsor's request to hold an  oral  hearing  does
    not seem to have been considered, in my judgment the most  procedurally
    fair approach to the appellant  and  sponsor  was  to  enable  a  fresh
    hearing to take place, to enable everything to  be  considered  afresh.
    As such, at the hearing on 31 July 2019, I set Judge Mailer's  decision
    aside and directed that the matter be reheard before me  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, in order for the sponsor to speak to the financial  documents
    I would direct him to provide.

Directions

15. I issued the following directions to ensure that the appellant was able
    to present her case by reference to the full financial circumstances of
    the sponsor, at the date of the hearing:

         'The Appellant must serve on (i) the Home Office and (ii) the Upper
         Tribunal a further copy of the documents she wishes to rely upon.

         These documents should demonstrate how the Appellant claims she met
         the financial requirements under Appendix FM-SE (i) at the date  of
         the application for entry clearance, and (ii) at the  date  of  the
         hearing on 26 September 2019.  The sponsor should  make  sure  that
         all evidence required under Appendix FM-SE is provided.

         The Upper Tribunal will need to consider whether  the  requirements
         of the Immigration Rules were met at the time  of  the  application
         for entry clearance and may also need to consider the  position  as
         at 26 September 2019.'

     The resumed hearing was initially listed for 27 August  2019,  and  the
    sponsor attended.  However, he did not have evidence of his up to  date
    earnings on that occasion.   It  appears  he  had  not  understood  the
    directions.  Out of fairness to the sponsor, I  adjourned  the  hearing
    again, until 26 September 2019,  to  enable  him  to  attend  with  the
    relevant documents.  On 25 September  2019,  the  sponsor  provided  an
    updated set of documents, as outlined below.

REMAKING DECISION

16. On 26 September 2019 I reheard the  appellant's  appeal.   The  sponsor
    appeared  for  the  appellant  and  Mr  Tarlow  again  represented  the
    respondent.

Legal framework

17. This is an appeal brought under Article 8 of the European Convention on
    Human Rights.  The essential issue for my consideration is  whether  it
    would  be  proportionate  under  the  terms  of  Article  8(2)  of  the
    Convention for the appellant to be refused entry clearance, in light of
    the family life she claims to enjoy with the sponsor.  This issue is to
    be addressed primarily through the lens of the Immigration  Rules,  and
    also by reference to the requirements of Article 8  of  the  Convention
    directly (see Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 at [17]).  The  Rules  relevant  to
    this  particular  case  are  contained  in  Appendix  FM,  specifically
    paragraph  E-ECP.3.1,  which  governs  the  so-called  "minimum  income
    requirement".

18.  In  addition,  there  are  a  number  of  statutory  public   interest
    considerations that  are  set  out  in  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to which I must have regard.

19. It is for the appellant to establish on the  balance  of  probabilities
    that her non-admission would breach the  United  Kingdom's  obligations
    under the European Convention on Human Rights.

Documentary evidence

20. Pursuant to my directions, the sponsor provided a bundle  of  evidence,
    including:

      a) Bank statements for the year ending 2016/2017;

      b) HMRC Self-Assessment, April 2017;

      c) Tax Return for 2016/2017;

      d) Accounts for year ending 5 April 2017;

      e) Accountant's letter, 11 January 2018;

      f) Bank statements for year ending 2017/2018;

      g) Tax return 2017/2018;

      h) Accounts for year ending 5 April 2018;

      i) Bank statements for year ending 2018/2019;

      j) HMRC Self-Assessment Statement, April 2019;

      k) Tax Return for 2018/2019;

      l) Accounts for Year Ending 5 April 2019;

      m) Bank Statements, 8 April 2019 to 24 September 2019.

The hearing

21. At the remaking hearing, I gave the sponsor the opportunity to take  me
    through the evidence.   There  was  no  cross-examination.   Mr  Tarlow
    submitted that the financial requirements were still not met, and  that
    the most  appropriate  remedy  for  the  appellant  would  be  a  fresh
    application, once the sponsor's earnings had exceeded the MIR.

Findings

22. The respondent accepted that the relationship requirements of  Appendix
    FM were met.  As such,  the  existence  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage relationship between the appellant and  the  sponsor  confirms
    that Article 8 is engaged by their relationship  and  the  respondent's
    refusal to grant entry clearance.  To assess whether that  refusal  was
    and is proportionate, in the first instance it is necessary to view the
    appeal through the lens of the Immigration Rules.

23. I find that the Entry  Clearance  Officer  did  not  err  in  law  when
    rejecting the original application for entry  clearance.   The  sponsor
    had not provided the specified evidence required by Appendix  FM-SE  to
    demonstrate that he earned �18,600.  In the tax  year  leading  to  the
    application, the sponsor had declared  a  taxable  income  of  �16,909,
    which plainly fell short of the minimum income requirement.  There  was
    no evidence of savings of the magnitude which would be required to make
    good any shortfall,  identified  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  as
    �20,227.50 (the shortfall multiplied by 2.5, plus �16,0000).  As  such,
    this appeal cannot succeed on the basis that the materials  before  the
    Entry Clearance Officer were incorrectly assessed as  not  meeting  the
    requirements of the rules at the date of the  application.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer correctly analysed the supporting evidence  presented
    to her, and properly concluded that the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules were not met.   Nothing in the materials  now  submitted  by  the
    sponsor demonstrates that that decision was unlawful or not open to the
    Entry Clearance Officer by reference to the materials provided with the
    application.

24. I also consider that the Entry Clearance Review Manager was entitled to
    conclude that the 2016/17 accounts which had  been  provided  with  the
    appeal did not demonstrate that the minimum income requirement was met.
     The sponsor had declared his 2016/17 taxable income as �22,603, and in
    support had  provided  copies  of  a  partially  complete  tax  return,
    demonstrating that it was 90% complete.  The sponsor explained that  he
    printed the summaries shortly before he finalised them  and  said  that
    they were an accurate reflection of his finances.   However, I consider
    the review manager to have been correct to conclude that the  sponsor's
    pre-submission tax return was incomplete, and not yet  final.   It  was
    yet to be submitted,  and  the  response  of  the  review  manager  was
    entirely reasonable.

Date of the hearing - 26 September 2019

25. I turn now to the position at the date of the hearing on  26  September
    2019.  As the Court of Appeal  recently  noted  in  GM  (Sri  Lanka)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 1630 at [7],
    it is necessary for a court or tribunal to ensure that  any  action  it
    takes is compliant with the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998:

         "When  a  Court  is  required  to  address  an  issue  relating  to
         fundamental norms or human rights that Court must ensure  that  any
         order that it makes is  also  compliant  with  such  rights.  Under
         section 6 Human  Rights  Act  1998  all  public  bodies,  including
         courts, must apply the Act and thereby the ECHR. It follows that if
         an appellate court finds that  a  lower  court  or  tribunal  acted
         lawfully by reference to the evidence before it but that based upon
         the facts now known to the appeal  court  to  uphold  the  decision
         would violate fundamental norms,  then  the  appellate  court  must
         ensure that the decision it  takes  is  compliant  with  the  law."
         (Emphasis original)

26. Having analysed the sponsor's bank statements, the accountant's report,
    and all other financial documents submitted, I find  that  the  sponsor
    does not meet the  minimum  income  requirement  at  the  date  of  the
    remaking hearing before me  on  26  September.   Although  the  sponsor
    provided an accountant's report and accounts made up to 5  April  2019,
    the income recorded on his bank statement covering the period reflected
    in those accounts is  less  than  the  gross  income  set  out  in  the
    accounts.

27. For the purposes of this analysis, I have adopted a  generous  approach
    to  the  sponsor's  bank  statements;   where   there   are   ambiguous
    transactions (for example, incoming transactions which do not appear to
    be attributable to a named company), I have included those  figures  in
    my calculations.   I have set out the details  in  the  Annex  to  this
    decision; I will refer only to the summary figures here.

28. The accounts state that the sponsor's income for the financial year  to
    5 April 2019 was �25,371,  with  fuel  and  expenses  totalling  �6,175
    (fuel, �2,141;  other  expenses,  �4,034)  giving  a  final  profit  of
    �19,196.  By contrast, only �22,991.97 of income  is  recorded  on  the
    bank statements, which must be set against the total expenses of �6,175
    listed for the year.  This gives a revised profit figure of �16,816.97,
    which does not meet the MIR of �18,600.

29. In any event, the financial year to 5 April 2019 does not, taken at its
    highest, represent a contemporary picture of  the  sponsor's  financial
    situation.  The fact that the sponsor is  so  close  to  the  threshold
    could be a weighty factor in  the  proportionality  assessment  I  will
    perform shortly, if it were the case that his income has  continued  at
    that rate.  It has not.  As the  calculations  set  out  in  the  Annex
    demonstrate, in  the  six  months  leading  to  the  hearing  (April  -
    September  2019),  the  sponsor's  gross  earnings  have   reduced   to
    �3,410.00, which is considerably below the MIR, even when  the  MIR  is
    reduced proportionately to cover only 6 months, i.e. to �9,300.  In the
    12 months to the hearing, the sponsor's gross income was �16.933.51.

30. The sponsor explained that his bank statements  do  not  represent  his
    full financial picture.  He is paid in cash for some of  his  work,  he
    said.  He keeps  records  of  those  transactions,  he  explained,  and
    provided the records to his accountant, which in  turn  his  accountant
    used to prepare his accounts and tax return.  He highlighted  that  the
    income declared to HMRC is at the "higher" rate contained in his annual
    accounts, observing that he has generated his tax liabilities  on  that
    basis.

31. The difficulty is that it is for the appellant to establish her case to
    the balance of probabilities standard.  The sponsor  has  not  provided
    any records of his cash transactions, for example copies of the details
    he submitted to his accountant.  He  has  not  obtained,  for  example,
    details of the workings  adopted  by  his  accountant  to  prepare  his
    accounts.  He has not provided copies of invoices, or  even  copies  of
    correspondence with his clients to arrange the work he claims  to  have
    undertaken on this informal basis.  While I have no reason to  make  an
    adverse credibility finding in relation to the sponsor, that  does  not
    mean  that  I  must  ascribe  weight  to   unsubstantiated   assertions
    unsupported by evidence.  The financial details the sponsor  sought  to
    establish would be relatively easy to substantiate in documentary form,
    especially given he  claims  to  have  documented  everything  for  his
    accountant.  Merely declaring income at a particular level to HMRC does
    not, when analysed alongside the other evidence, demonstrate  that  the
    sponsor earned the level at which the declaration was made.

32. It follows, therefore, that the sponsor's financial position as at  the
    date of the hearing is  that  his  self-employment  does  not  generate
    sufficient income to satisfy the requirements of the MIR.  Although  in
    her application, the appellant suggested that the sponsor's parents may
    be able to provide a degree of financial support, there was no evidence
    from them to that effect. When  the  proportionality  of  refusing  the
    appellant entry clearance is viewed through the lens of the Immigration
    Rules, the refusal decision was and is proportionate.

33.  It  is  still  necessary  to  consider,  by  reference  to  the  wider
    considerations of proportionality, whether there  are  reasons  outside
    the Immigration Rules which demonstrate that the continued  refusal  of
    entry  clearance  would   be   unjustifiably   harsh,   and   therefore
    disproportionate. In order to conduct this assessment, I will  adopt  a
    balance sheet approach.

34. Factors in favour of refusing entry clearance include:

      a) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the  public
         interest (section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act);

      b) The appellant is unable to meet the requirements of the Immigration
         Rules, for the reasons set out above;

      c) Little weight should be given to family life established at a  time
         when a person's immigration status is precarious; by  analogy,  the
         family life established by the appellant and the sponsor has  taken
         place entirely within the confines of  a  situation  in  which  the
         appellant has never enjoyed leave to remain in the United  Kingdom,
         the relationship  having  begun  with  the  appellant  and  sponsor
         initially living in different continents.

35. Factors in favour of granting entry clearance include:

      a) The disruption to family life between the appellant and the sponsor
         has been ongoing for some time, causing  great  difficulty  in  the
         maintenance of their relationship;

      b) It has taken longer for this matter to be resolved in the  Tribunal
         due to two earlier decisions of the First-tier Tribunal  being  set
         aside  due  to  documents   being   misplaced   by   the   Tribunal
         administration;

      c) The appellant speaks English, meaning she will be less of a  burden
         on taxpayers, and would be better able to  integrate  into  society
         (section 117B (2) of the 2002 Act;

      d) Although the sponsor does not meet the MIR, it  is  clear  he  does
         make some money from his self-employed courier  business,  and  the
         earnings  for  the  tax  year  to  5  April  2019  did   not   fall
         significantly short of the MIR requirements;

      e) The sponsor explained that he suffered a light industrial injury to
         his arm, for which he is (separately)  seeking  compensation.   His
         earning potential may have been impacted by this development.

36. I consider that the reasons  in  favour  of  refusing  entry  clearance
    outweigh those in favour of granting it.  The public  interest  in  the
    maintenance of effective  immigration  control  is  a  weighty  factor.
    While it is capable of being outweighed  by  exceptional  circumstances
    which would render a continued refusal unjustifiably harsh,  there  are
    no such exceptional circumstances in the present matter. The  Secretary
    of State bears the unique constitutional responsibility - and expertise
    - to set the level of the minimum income requirement, and  the  sponsor
    has failed to meet that requirement.  There is no medical  evidence  or
    other similar material setting out the impact of  the  sponsor's  light
    industrial accident on his self-employment.  The  interference  in  the
    combined Article 8 family life rights of the sponsor and the  appellant
    is justified by their combined failure to meet the requirements of  the
    Immigration  Rules.   There  is  nothing  to  stop  the  sponsor   from
    increasing his earnings in the future (or ensuring more accurate record
    keeping), to pave the way for a successful entry clearance  application
    in the future.

37. The appeal is dismissed.
