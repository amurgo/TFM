                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Secretary  of  State  appeals  to  the  Tribunal  with  permission
      against the determination of an  Adjudicator,  C.C.  Wright  Esq.,  in
      which he allowed the appeal of the respondent, hereinafter referred to
      as the claimant, against the Secretary  of  State's  decision   of  22
      September 2003, issuing directions for his  removal  from  the  United
      Kingdom and refusing asylum.

2.    The hearing before us took place on  8  November  2004.  Ms  R.  Brown
      appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State and Mr G. Lee for Blavo &
      Co. solicitors appeared on behalf of the claimant

3.    The claimant is a Palestinian from Lebanon.  His claim  to  asylum  is
      summed up in the Adjudicator's lengthy paragraph 4 which sets out  the
      background,  including  reference  to   the   claimant's   educational
      qualifications and his subsequent membership  of  Fatah  and  the  six
      incidents which occurred while he was in the Lebanon which caused  him
      to leave in November  1998  and  come  to  the  United  Kingdom.   The
      Adjudicator found the claimant to be credible.  He considered that the
      evidence showed that the authorities were unwilling or unable to offer
      him protection against one Saleh, a person who had attacked him  at  a
      wedding in June 1998, Abu Nadil and the Hezbollah  organisations,  and
      was also persuaded that it was not possible for the claimant  to  have
      relocated to the El-Buss or Rashidieh  refugee  camps  in  Tyre  where
      further reconstruction had been prohibited and where he perceived that
      he would be denied entry.

4.     The  Adjudicator  went  on  to  conclude  at  paragraph  11  of   his
      determination that the claimant, as the child of  professional  school
      teachers and as a man wishing to pursue an academic career and  obtain
      a degree, and having been denied that opportunity in Lebanon and  also
      on  account  of  Palestinian  ethnicity,  would  continue  to   suffer
      instances  of  harassment  and  discrimination  by  Abu-Nidal   and/or
      Hezbollah, and was in a situation  where  third  category  rights,  as
      identified by Professor  Hathaway  would  be  denied  particularly  as
      regards legitimate  aspirations  for  academic,  economic  and  social
      development. He therefore allowed the appeal.

5.    The Secretary of State took issue  with  the  Adjudicator's  findings,
      firstly as regards  the  issue  of  protection,  secondly  as  regards
      relocation, and thirdly (the structure  of  the  grounds  is  somewhat
      curious) as regards whether or not what had happened to  the  claimant
      amounted to persecution.  Reference was made in  the  grounds  to  the
      Country Report of April 2002 which was before the Adjudicator.

6.    Before us Ms Brown effectively abandoned ground 1, on the  basis  that
      no error of law had been  shown. As regards ground 3, she read this as
      challenging paragraph 11 of the determination on the  basis  that  the
      Adjudicator  appeared to conclude that the incidents in question   had
      effectively prevented the claimant from enjoying third category rights
      rather than the discrete issue of whether denial of  such  rights  was
      persecutory vis-ï¿½-vis Palestinians in Lebanon per se.  The Adjudicator
      therefore  had not found that in general for Palestinians  in  Lebanon
      their situation was such as to give rise to persecution and/or  breach
      of their Article 3 rights, but it was rather the six  incidents  which
      arose from the claimant's involvement which would place him at risk on
      return.

   7. Otherwise, Ms Brown argued that in the alternative she relied  on  the
      Country Guidance decision of the Tribunal in KK [2004] UKIAT 00293 and
      the claim was not made out.  With regard to  the  six  incidents,  the
      Adjudicator accepted that the claimant was at risk  in  his  own  area
      but, Ms  Brown  argued,  the  Adjudicator  was  wrong  about  internal
      relocation.  She accepted that  the  six  incidents  accepted  by  the
      Adjudicator  would  be  enough  to  place  the  claimant  at  risk  of
      persecution in his specific home area.

   8. With regard to ground 2, the  Adjudicator  had  not  referred  to  any
      objective evidence to support his concerns about  the  feasibility  of
      relocation.  The Country Report had  been  before  him  and  Ms  Brown
      referred in particular to paragraph 5.72 of that report where  it  was
      stated at the outset that Palestinian refugees in Lebanon were free to
      relocate from one camp to  another,  though  it  went  on  to  mention
      various practical restrictions that might exist in  that  regard.  The
      matter was referred to in Mr Joffe's report which was in the bundle at
      paragraph 8 and again at paragraph 77, but he had cited no  source  or
      objective reference to substantiate the contention made, for  example,
      at paragraph 77 that, although the claimant could in  theory  move  to
      another camp, it would be  virtually  impossible  to  survive  without
      relatives given the intensive  family-based  relationships  that   tie
      Palestinian society. Mr Joffe had clearly accepted in KK (paragraph 33
      and also at paragraph 86)  that  Palestinians  can  relocate  and  the
      claimant could therefore return to a different camp.

9.    It could be seen from paragraph 5.67 of the April 2002 Country  Report
      that Fatah are currently believed to be  in  overall  control  of  the
      largest refugee camp, Ein el-Hilweh, where various groups  opposed  to
      Fateh also have a presence.  Ms  Brown  also  suggested  that  linking
      paragraph 5.62, naming the locations and size of the various camps  in
      the Lebanon with paragraph 5.72, showed that there would be more space
      available to the claimant in  the  north  and  he  would  be  able  to
      relocate there.  Even if the camp to  which  he  sought  to  move  was
      overcrowded it would not be unduly harsh especially given that in  the
      north the camps were less crowded and less expensive than the previous
      area in which he had lived.

10.   The claimant had been involved with Fatah at a  relatively  low  level
      and had problems with local opposition people and it would be unlikely
      that if he relocated that others would get to know and in any event he
      would be protected by being in an essentially  Fatah  camp.  She  also
      referred us to the determination of the Tribunal in  MA  [2004]  UKIAT
      00112, in particular paragraphs 14 and 15  on  the  practicalities  of
      relocation.

11.   In his submissions Mr Lee said that he would  essentially  concentrate
      on ground 2 in the light of the points made by Ms Brown on  the  other
      two grounds.  It seemed from the country report that Ein el-Hilweh was
      in fact in Sidon so although it was Fatah camp it could  not  be  read
      with paragraph 5.72 since that concerned camps in the south. He  would
      be unlikely to  be  welcomed  to  the  northern  camps  as  they  were
      essentially  run by people who were anti-Fatah.
12.   The essence of Mr Lee's submissions was that there  was  no  error  of
      law by the Adjudicator. He  had  carefully  looked  at  the  objective
      material and had  assessed  the  submissions  on  the  claimant's  own
      experiences.  Mr Lee argued that paragraph 10 concerned the claimant's
      particular situation and paragraph 11  was  separate  and  dealt  more
      generally with the third category rights dealt with in KK.  Relocation
      had been properly considered at paragraph 10.  There was  the  further
      point referred to by Mr Joffe in KK concerning problems of freedom  of
      movement. The Adjudicator had been entitled to conclude as he  did  on
      the facts of the case. He accepted that he had not referred to Ein el-
      Hilweh when considering alternative camps and argued that that was not
      an error of  law.  There  was  an  overlap  between  the  question  of
      sufficiency of protection and relocation as there was an issue  as  to
      whether various camps could offer protection to  the  claimant.    The
      Tribunal should be slow to say that the camps could offer  protection.
      Likewise the absence of evidence concerning the conditions in Ein  el-
      Hilweh should not lead to the Tribunal to conclude that it was a  camp
      to which the claimant could  be  returned.  He  also  referred  us  to
      paragraph 77 of Mr Joffe's report.  It should be borne in mind that it
      was not enough to say that physically or  theoretically  the  claimant
      could relocate but it was a question of whether  it  would  be  unduly
      harsh.

13.   Ground 2 essentially concentrated on efforts to relocate but that  was
      not really the issue, the question was  the  realistic  practicalities
      and the fact was that the claimant did not have  to  exhaust  all  the
      possibilities.  The determination could not properly be challenged  in
      this regard.  There were  clearly  problems  of  freedom  of  movement
      adverted to in the grounds of appeal and there was a reference to this
      at paragraph 84 in KK.

14.   There was a final point that as  the  child  of  school  teachers  and
      being well educated and studying for a business administration  degree
      in the United Kingdom the impact on the claimant of not being able  to
      pursue  anything  remotely  commensurate  to  his  qualifications  and
      ability was discriminatory to the extent of being persecutory.

15.   By way of reply Ms  Brown made the point  that  the  particular  camps
      named at paragraph 5.72 of the Country Report   had  been  problematic
      but not specifically Ein el-Hilweh.  There was no evidence of problems
      in the Sidon camps.  The Adjudicator had clearly erred in law  in  not
      considering relocation to any other than two specific  camps  that  he
      had named and also had accepted with no  reference  to  the  objective
      evidence what he had said about the practicalities of relocation.

16.    We  consider  that  the  issues  in  this  case  essentially  concern
      relocation.  It seems to be accepted on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
      State that the six events identified by the Adjudicator at paragraph 4
      of  his  determination  are  such  as  to  evidence  a  real  risk  of
      persecution in his immediate home area. The Adjudicator had relatively
      little to say about relocation. He accepted that  the  claimant  could
      not relocate to  the  El-Buss  or  Rashideh  refugee  camps  in  Tyre,
      commenting that further reconstruction had  been  prohibited  and  the
      claimant had perceived that he would be denied entry. In our view  the
      Adjudicator's conclusions in this regard contain a clear error of law.
       There are, after all, as is clear from the Country Report  which  was
      before the Adjudicator,  twelve  refugee  camps  for  Palestinians  in
      Lebanon, and  there  is  no  particular  reason  why  he  should  have
      restricted his consideration to  the  two  particular  camps  that  he
      mentioned. When summarising the objective evidence at paragraph  7  he
      mentioned El-Buss and Rashidieh as being already  overcrowded  and  as
      being camps where construction work is prohibited.  This  evidence  he
      would appear to have taken from the Country Report at  paragraph  5.72
      and there is mention of a third camp, Buri el-Shemali,  of  which  the
      same is true. However,  as  Ms  Brown  pointed  out,  there  is  clear
      reference at paragraph 5.67 of the same report  to  Ein  el-Hilweh  as
      being the largest refugee camp and one of which  Fatah  was  currently
      believed to be in overall control.  It also said that  various  groups
      opposed to Fatah have a presence in that camp, but the Adjudicator did
      not consider the possibility of relocation to that camp at all.

  17. In this context we think it is also relevant to express our  agreement
      with the point made by Ms Brown that given the very low level at which
      the claimant operated we do not consider that on relocation if he  did
      so relocate  to Ein el-Hilweh the claimant would face  any  risk  from
      anyone in that camp opposed to the Fatah movement, bearing in mind the
      low profile of the work which he  had  carried  out  and  the  extreme
      unlikelihood that anybody in that camp would have any knowledge of him
      or his previous activities.   We do not therefore  consider  that  the
      Adjudicator's conclusions are  sustainable.   It  is  clear  from  the
      country report that  Palestinian  refugees  in  Lebanon  are  free  to
      relocate from one camp to another and only need to inform the UNRWA if
      they wished to continue to claim UNRWA services in the camp  to  which
      they have moved.  We note the point made by Mr Joffe in particular  at
      paragraph 77 of his report that the claimant could in theory  move  to
      another camp but  given the intense family  based  relationships  that
      tie Palestinians society together it would be virtually impossible for
      him to survive without relatives. No evidence  is  provided  for  this
      contention, and we do not observe  that  qualification  to  have  been
      expressed by Mr Joffe when he gave evidence to the Tribunal in KK,  in
      particular as recorded at paragraph 33 of that  determination.  As  Mr
      Lee  accepted,  there  is  something  of  a  lacuna  in  the  evidence
      concerning the situation and conditions in the Ein el-Hilweh camp, but
      the burden of proof is of course on him, and we do not  consider  that
      burden has in any way shifted by the fact that this is  the  Secretary
      of State's appeal.  It remains the case that  we  have  identified  an
      error of law in the Adjudicator's determination  and  it  is  for  the
      claimant to make his case and the absence of evidence in  this  regard
      does not assist him.  Such evidence  as  we  have,  from  the  country
      report, indicates as we have said that Fatah are  believed  to  be  in
      overall control of Ein el-Hilweh and that  adds  significance  to  the
      ability of the claimant to relocate to that camp.  He  is  clearly  an
      intelligent and educated man and that is of relevance also with regard
      to the possibilities for employment that would exist for  him  in  the
      camp.

18.   The conclusion of the Tribunal in  KK,  to  be  found  in  summary  as
      regards the Refugee Convention claim at paragraph 106, is that to  the
      extent there is a discriminatory denial of third  category  rights  in
      Lebanon to the Palestinians this does not amount to persecution  under
      the Refugee Convention.  The Tribunal went on to conclude at paragraph
      107 that the Article 3 threshold would  not  be  crossed  either.   We
      adopt the reasoning and conclusions of the Tribunal in KK. Accordingly
      we do not consider that there is force to  Mr  Lee's  point  that  the
      claimant  by  dint  of  the  contrast  between   his   abilities   and
      qualifications would find himself having to take on  employment  at  a
      level with such a degree of difference as between what he could do and
      what he would be allowed to do as to give rise  to  a  breach  of  his
      rights such as to be persecutory or in breach of Article 3.  We do not
      consider that the evidence comes anywhere near crossing the  threshold
      in either case for the claimant.

19.   In conclusion, therefore, we consider that it has  been  shown  to  be
      the case  that  there  was  an  error  of  law  in  the  Adjudicator's
      determination and we consider that his findings on relocation are  not
      sustainable.  He could  and  should  have  gone  on  to  consider  the
      possibility of relocation to other camps than the two  he  considered.
      His perception that the claimant would be denied entry to  El-Buss  or
      Rashidieh is also a matter for which there is no evidential foundation
      than his own unsubstantiated contention and we consider that  this  is
      also a flawed aspect of  the  determination.   We  consider  that  the
      evidence shows that relocation in this case  for  the  claimant  to  a
      different camp, in particular  Ein  el-Hilweh,  would  not  be  unduly
      harsh, given the fact that it is believed to be overall in the control
      of Fatah which is the organisation he supports and that as a young man
      with abilities and qualifications  he  could  relocate  there  without
      undue difficulties.

20.   We therefore allow the Secretary of State's appeal.
